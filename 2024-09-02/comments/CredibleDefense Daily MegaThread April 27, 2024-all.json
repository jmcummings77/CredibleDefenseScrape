The infrastructure is just not there. They might be able to get trains from China or North Korea to supply small amounts of fuel. We're talking 100 fully loaded 100 car trains a day to run the russian economy.\n\n\n\nOil will run their economy for the foreseeable future. Primarily industry (farming and heavy mining equipment) and moving stuff. There just aren't alternatives to oil for those industries.\n\n\n\nAlternatives to oil do exist. Mainly electric vehicles. And Russia could pivot and buy many from china at cheap rates. But the cheap chineses evs are small cars with shortish range. They are not exactly cheap for an economy that is on a war path. So they probably wont have a major impact for decades. But rich people will still be able to get around.\n\n\n\nRussia really needs oil for their trucks. And there just aren't cheap alternatives to oil right now.\u00a0\n\n\nThe question is how much does the disruption continue.\u00a0 My guess is we are seeing the beginning of this campaign, and Ukraine is going to just keep ramping it up. If it was 66 drones today,\u00a0in a year, we might see 200 drones a day on average going after critical infrastructure in Russia. And the drones will get better at avoiding air defense over time.\n\n\n\nIt'll be a huge test of the effectiveness of air defense. My guess is that air defense will always eventually fail on a long enough timeline. This is true for Ukraine and Russia. But I believe Ukraine, due to their political makeup, is more resliant to air attack as a society than Russia. Mainly due to western support.\n\n\n\nHow will this look in a few years? Oil production and electricity production severly limited in Russia. The same would be true for Ukraine, but Ukraine can be supported by oil/electricity from the west. With the west slowly transitioning to evs, that will free up plenty of oil supplies for Ukraine to run their economy, and I guarantee you refineries in Europe will be looking for new markets for their oil supplies. Ukraine is a great option if they can convince their local government to buy the fuel. And if people are willing to forego electeicity for heating/ac, small generators go a long way in Ukraine. If they have fuel in Ukraine. If Russia doesn't have the fuel, generators don't work.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRussia has no such options. They have to produce most of their stuff internally with reluctant support from their reluctant ally China. Don't expect China to support Russia with huge fuel deliveries. Maybe small token fuel deliveries to hold Putins balls over the fire.\n\n\n\nRussia could also decentralize their refineries. I say this because refining crude oil is a fairly simple process if you are willing to forgoe efficiencies and fuel quality. Western style refineries are used for higher quality fuel and better yields. A simple stack heating crude oil can yield fuel that will burn in diesel trucks. These types of simple, stupid refineries could be built in a few months with an engineer and a couple pipe welders.\n\n\n\nI see major problems with such refineries:\n\n\n* They'll probably flare gas, so they'll be extremely easy to spot. Firms data could probably spot them.\n\n* Corruption. If there is a fuel shortage, what stops one of the hundreds of site managers from selling the fuel on the side?\n* Still vulnerable to drone attack\n\n\n\nSo with my brainstorm, I'd expect Ukraine to continue using drones and to continue hitting Russian critical infrastructure. I'd expect Russian snd Ukrainian infrastructure to slowly degrade over time, even with the fixes.\u00a0",

And strange actions took place near Ocheretyne. The previous brigade held these positions, prepared them for themselves, they were lined up. They knew their places, they were striking the enemy, keeping them away, holding these positions. Then the 115th Brigade came in and some incomprehensible maneuvers on the part of the enemy began and the frontline collapsed.\u201d*\n\n*There are currently many reports on social media \"about a lot of missing or dead soldiers who were part of the 115th Brigade,\" said the DeepState analyst. \"Now relatives and friends of the soldiers, who are also from the 115th Brigade, have started to write about what happened,\" he added.*\n\n*\u201cAnd from this analysis, it turns out that the situation is very difficult and raises a lot of questions.\u201d*\n\n*This is not a question for ordinary soldiers, platoon and company commanders who are simply given a task and have to hold back the enemy with scarce resources, people and other problems, Pohorilyi stated.*\n\n*\"The brigade command is directly responsible and controls all these processes, and there are a lot of questions to them,\" said the DeepState analyst. \u201cWe need to clarify the situation, to avoid any specific conclusions, because without understanding the situation, it is impossible to find answers.\u201d*\n\n*Such mistakes should not be repeated, as Ukrainian soldiers are dying because of them. \"It may be the transmission of false information from the field, a false situation, distorted, something may have been underreported,\" said Pohorilyi.*\n\n*\u201cIt could be a process of irresponsibility in controlling the provision of resources, means, people. The reports on people on paper are one thing, but in reality they are different. There are a lot of these processes that need to be answered. And then we need to find out and bring to justice the guilty people who allowed this to happen, because the consequences are enormous. Soldiers of other brigades are forced to lay down their lives to stabilize the situation.\u201d*\n\n**The Situation in Ocheretyne**\n\n*Ukrainian forces control two-thirds of Ocheretyne, while the rest remainsunder the fire control of the Ukrainian army, Lieutenant Colonel Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the Khortytsia operational and strategic troop grouping, said on April 26.*\n\n*The Russian troops are blocked in the village, and Ukrainian forces are taking all necessary measures to drive the invasion forces out.*\n\n*A DeepState post on Telegram on April 24 said that the situation around the Russian breakthrough near Ocheretyne exposed a number of problems, \"starting with the incompetence of some spokespeople who undermine confidence in the military and political leadership with statements that look extremely untrue against the background of the enemy's visual presence in the center of the village.\"*\n\n*\"The leadership of the 115th Separate Mechanized Brigade is responsible for the collapse of defense in the entire area, having incurred significant losses in killed, wounded and missing persons,\" DeepState said.*\n\n*\u201cIt's no secret, there are plenty of recent posts on social media about the search for relatives. Ordinary soldiers should not be punished for the lack of organization and interaction in the brigade \u2013 they are already paying with their lives and health.\u201d*\n\n*Nazar Voloshyn, a spokesman for the Khortytsia troop grouping, said on April 23 that Russia is trying to gain a foothold in the southern part of Ocheretyne, but the Ukrainian Armed Forces control most of the village.

Fascinating stuff.  \n\n*The general structure and operational methods of SBU appear to be very similar to that of its predecessor (KGB of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic) with exception of Ukrainian Border Guards and department responsible for security of high-rank state officials. Both of them became independent institutions. However, the SBU keeps under its control special operation Alpha units with bases in every Ukrainian province.

        "body": "As a followup to [my recent post about Russian IFV/AFVs in storage](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1cbwcfs/comment/l136vp2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Twitter user Jompy who did one of the counts has published comprehensive threads on the overall state of Russian IFV/AFVs excluding BMPs and BTR-60/70/80s including the satellite imagery obtained of Russian bases which wasnt used for the article.\n\n[Lets start with MT-LBs](https://x.com/Jonpy99/status/1783556507407151579):\n\nPrewar Russia had 2230 in storage, as of late 2023/early 2024 they had 869 working hulls and 52 broken + up to 100 specialized variants usually for artillery-related purposes. 1345 have been removed from storage or scrapped, Jompy notes that given very high rates of losses for IFV/AFVs over the winter and into this spring the remaining serviceable MT-LBs may be already nearly gone from storage.\n\n[Next up BMDs ](https://x.com/Jonpy99/status/1783918524185928024)\n\nPrewar Russia had 637 BMDs or BMD-based variants in storage almost all being BMD-1s, now they have 235 working hulls of which 58 are artillery command variants and 9 broken hulls. They have mostly stopped being used by VDV units so they are being given to low-quality units in desperate need of armor.\n\n[Now lets look at BTR-50s](https://x.com/Jonpy99/status/1783936564688453829)\n\nRussia only had 129 in storage before the war and this has decreased to 7 working hulls and 42 broken, they are functionally extinct beyond what exists in active units.\n\n[Next are MT-LBu's](https://x.com/Jonpy99/status/1784150731693412614)\n\nRussia had 1229 in storage prewar and has 959 working and 94 broken hulls remaining, almost all vehicles are command/artillery variants and given their higher profile and longer length they are even less suited to frontline work than MT-LBs but still could be used if all other armor is exhausted.\n\n[Lastly we have BRDMs](https://x.com/Jonpy99/status/1784254470345367832)\n\nRussia had 1300 in storage prewar and now has 937 working and 251 broken vehicles almost all are BRDM-2s, BRDMs are rarely used in Ukraine and have very little value offensively although ATGM variants could have some utility for mobile defense, as with MT-LBu's they provide almost nothing for offensive operations and likely wont be used in any meaningful numbers until everything else is exhausted.\n\nOpinion section:\n\nAs we have seen most of the rare combat useful IFV/AFVs have been removed from storage or will be soon, this is why I've been so interested in BMP and BTRs left in storage as once their depleted Russia has very little to fall back on. Once we get a full count of BTRs + BMPs we will have a more complete picture but overall Russia will likely be facing a serious shortage of IFV/AFVs in 2025 with limited options to purchase more as NK has very few of either and likely wouldn't be willing to sell any of their already very outdated vehicles and Iran likewise has >3800 and would probably only be able to supply a few hundred BMP1/2s and BTR-80s.",

                        "body": "I'm not sure that they manufactured new missiles for that, the Greek order from what I've seen was for a limited number of missiles alongside their initial F3R Rafale order (the numbers I've seen have been in the low 20s range to complement their existing inventory with the primary focus being the MLU program). Greece already has its own SCALP inventory and is planning to divest and retire it's Mirage 2000-5 fleet, further reducing the pressure on that inventory.\n\nSome degree of ambiguity here or even just outright lies for the benefit of calming Turkey and keeping production capacity opaque would be understandable. I doubt we'll get concrete numbers on the Greek order in particular for that reason and so I'm open to any figure being reasonable, we just don't have much credible information on how many Greece ordered.\n\nIt's entirely possible that they sourced those units from refurbishment and ex-French stock (just like the initial batch of Rafale's). I haven't seen any concrete evidence of an active production line. I'm not saying it's not possible for one to exist or that their MLU operation couldn't spin up to produce a small number of missiles. But I haven't seen any evidence that would confirm that there is an active production line in the traditional and historical sense for SCALP-EG, back when hundreds a year were being mass produced.\n\nThe vast majority of MDBA's missile division is assigned to their other profit centers, the SCALP line mostly moved on to MdCN production which isn't as analogous to SCALP-EG as one might initially think, there's a lot of structural and hardware specific changes that had to be made to the initial design to make it work in a naval VLS setting.\n\nAlso Hoffmann is hardly a concrete source on this issue, that very same day he claimed there wasn't a production line at all:\n\n[https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744648559155089439](https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744648559155089439)\n\nA random twitter user claims otherwise and Hoffmann replies with a really weird obfuscation of what a production line is, instead of probably just admitting in the first place that he forgot.\n\n[https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744687207359635933](https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744687207359635933)  \n  \nTwo hours later Hoffmann corrects himself, clarifying that there is an open production line for a Greek order but not an open French order.\n\n[https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744687644175483162](https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744687644175483162)\n\nWhat makes matters worse: \n\n[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1678800798694752258.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1678800798694752258.html)\n\nIt's then clear here that he's basing his \\*assumption\\* of a production line on the existence and value of the order and his napkin math of the total number of ordered SCALP's, which is next to impossible to quantify an upper limit for given we don't know the value of the used Rafales or the quantity of munitions provided in the rest of the arms package outside of SCALP-EG's. There is absolutely nothing credible to \"50-100 SCALP-EGs\". That's napkin math and using that to springboard to the analysis of their being an active production line is a stretch. I'm not saying it's not possible, it's very possible, it's just not something we've seen confirmation of. \n\nThis is also based on the mother of all assumptions, that France would be unwilling to transfer SCALP-EGs. This is the same France that has been actively trying to divest from SCALP since around 2014, deliberately reducing its inventory through fire missions to reduce upkeep cost as well as seeking partial retirement down to dangerously low levels. This is also the same France that originally ordered 500 SCALP-EG's, consumed anywhere between 20-40 in fire missions and donated 90 to Ukraine, leaving them with an inventory of somewhere close to 400 missiles that they're planning to replace starting in 2028 which in missile procurement terms is very soon. Arguably they have already started replacing them operationally given their recent strikes have used MdCN instead of SCALP which is somewhat analogous however with the benefit of having a much longer range and active production to backfill consumption.\n\nAssuming the French wouldn't part with SCALP missiles thereby necessitating the resumption of a production line which had not produced any new SCALP-EG's since 2016, which was the conclusion of the last order to Egypt, is the mother of all assumptions and is not itself evidence of an active production line. A single Greek order that could be a very low number of SCALP-EG's that themselves could come entirely from French stocks similar to other munitions and aircraft in the order, is not itself evidence of an active production line in the sense everyone thinking of a production line understands it.\n\nI'm open to the idea that their MLU line can still produce a limited number of SCALP-EG's, or perhaps even a full production line does still exist either adjacent to or including large parts of the MdCN line however thus far we've seen no peek behind the curtain of this line, nor hard evidence that it actually exists. \n\n[https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744701297041760259](https://twitter.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1744701297041760259)\n\n\\^\\^ This is unrelated to the others, but I thought it was funny that after essentially running a correction the same twitter user came back with another correction about UK Rampage purchases, sometimes you just can't win hehe",

Greece already has its own SCALP inventory and is planning to divest and retire it&#39;s Mirage 2000-5 fleet, further reducing the pressure on that inventory.</p>\n\n<p>Some degree of ambiguity here or even just outright lies for the benefit of calming Turkey and keeping production capacity opaque would be understandable. I doubt we&#39;ll get concrete numbers on the Greek order in particular for that reason and so I&#39;m open to any figure being reasonable, we just don&#39;t have much credible information on how many Greece ordered.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that they sourced those units from refurbishment and ex-French stock (just like the initial batch of Rafale&#39;s).

The fundamental problems in war supplies and logistics is the same: you are liable to get interdicted at every point along the way. So how do the drug cartels deal with this problem? The current approach is:\n- move the production to a spot as far out of reach of the enemy as possible, where they can't hit you out of distance or political constraints.\n- at that spot, churn out as much of the producta as possible, in industrial quantities, at the cheapest price as possible.\n- use a network of runners to then move the supplies into the contested areas. Because they can churn out prodigious quantities of the products, it doesn't matter that the odd runners get caught, there are tons and tons of products elsewhere.\n\nPut this into the war context. Pick the US vs.  Soviet & China proxy war in Vietnam. North Vietnam was bombed. Did the Soviet Union and Chinese put defence productions inside North Vietnam? Well, some SKS production lines which were destroyed. No, the supply chain started all the way  from.the Soviet Union and transported through China or over the oceans.

OK, how about you put the plant near the Polish-Ukrainian borders (so that distance.to the front is shorter), hire Ukrainian workers (drafted by Ukrainian government and paid with Ukrainian wage so that it's cheaper), and be immune from bombing (Article 5), and PUT THE AIR DEFENCE ON THE FRONT, where they are really hurting for air defence.\n\nThe fact that they or their supporters think that this is a good idea tells me that either they suck at war logistics or they are not serious. One possible alternative explanation is that if European fundings are to be used to do this and if the plant is not in Ukraine, EU countries will bicker to put the plant in their countries \"to create jobs\" ,etc ....

At that point, it definitely makes sense for them to endogenously produce tanks, because their genocidal neighbor continues to threaten them.

At that point, it definitely makes sense for them to endogenously produce tanks, because their genocidal neighbor continues to threaten them. Without active bombing of their country, which in a frozen conflict is very unlikely because Russia will want to normalize somewhat with the West if only to stop the hurting, production makes most sense locally.</p>\n</div>",
