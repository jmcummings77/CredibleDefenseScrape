Most were likely from the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade.](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1588248177861615616)\n\nIf you were paying attention to Russian Telegram, starting around Oct 29, they were really excited about a big offensive in the village of Pavlivka near Donetsk. Their enthusiasm waned in the following days. Some excerpts and a timeline from Russian telegram:\n\n> Marine units of the Pacific Fleet, together with the DPR OBTF and MGB MGB, during the attack on Ukrainian positions in the village of Pavlovka, were able to penetrate 3.5 km deep into the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and break through it, reaching southern outskirts of Pavlovka\u2026Now the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are cleaning up the settlement. - Given the pace of advancement of the Russian fighters of group V, the purge of Pavlovka will be completed in the near future, and Ugledar will be taken into a semicircle. Russian troops will return the positions lost in the summer. If reinforcements are not transferred to the Ukrainian formations, very soon Russian troops will reach Vodyany and the Yuzhno-Ukrainskaya mine. In this case, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will have to retreat and build up defenses along the Uspenka-Konstantinovka line along the Sukhie Yala River. And this, in turn, will jeopardize the supply of the Donetsk grouping of the enemy along the Zaporozhye-Donetsk highway.\n\nThen, a couple days later:\n\n>Fighting resumed in the Ugledar direction. Our artillery is actively working against the enemy, with the support of aviation. The minimum task is to drive Ukrainian units out of Pavlovka and Novomikhailovka, and take control of the Ugledar-Maryinka highway. Success in the Ugledar direction will allow our forces to accelerate the liberation of Donbass and Zaporozhye.\n\nThen, on Nov 2:\n\n>Battles for Pavlovka: analysis of the current situation. Military correspondents and the media report that more than 80% of the village of Pavlovka is under the control of the advancing \"Allied Forces\", at the moment the Armed Forces of Ukraine control only the northwestern part of the settlement. The remaining fortified positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this area remain behind the village - this is the territory of a sand pit, a cow farm, a grain elevator and summer cottages / rates. \n\nThen, this latest update: \n\n>Due to the pulling of the APU of reserves to the front line, the pace of advancement of the RF Armed Forces has fallen. The situation is complicated by bad weather with slush, which imposes restrictions on the movement of equipment and the supply of forces that have gone ahead. - In Pavlovka, intense fighting continues in the building: the streets can change hands several times a day. The Armed Forces of Ukraine still control the northern outskirts of the village, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation - the rest. \n\nNow, Ukrainian sources did talk about a big tank push by the Russians in this direction as well, but the post Rob Lee references does reinforce what we\u2019ve seen in Bakhmut, which is that Russian offensives have been paved with a lot of blood. They may very well take Pavlivka, but at what cost. Any offensive, ostensibly, would be, but the Russians seem to be throwing more bodies in the hopes of a brute win than the Ukrainians. And before too many conclusions are drawn from this anecdote, it is still an anecdote. While I do reject this notion that we are completely in the dark on Ukrainian casualties in the Svatove direction, the attrition in the Ukrainian ranks wouldn\u2019t be insignificant either.",

Congress recently has allocated funds to do this, but to be frank, recently Navy has focused more on getting new ships than it has on upgrading the infrastructure to maintain the ships it has. \n\n2. Fleet size, composition, and procurement. Right now, Navy is having a difficult time deciding how big it wants its fleet, what it wants its fleet to be comprised of, and procuring new ships to fulfill that vision. The LCS class is being retired early along with the Zumwalts. Navy spent a lot of money upgrading some Ticonderoga class cruisers, and wants to retire those newly upgraded ships early as well. Additionally, the procurement process is taking too long, is too costly, and the major civilian shipyards that build new ships may not have sufficient capacity if Navy really wants to pursue a 355 ship fleet. \n\n3. Insufficient Resources. One of the alarms being sounded is that Navy ships are spending longer durations at sea, thus requiring Navy to postpone maintenance. Furthermore, longer deployments lead to greater sailor attritional rates and frustrate necessary training, which is critical.\n\nFor example, u/Shellback1 rightly points out that Navy used to run on \"fives and dimes,\" meaning five hours on watch and ten hours off, which contributed to the USS Fitzwilliam and USS McCain accidents.

Longer deployments - and the pressure that they create on sailors - caused this problem, and the 7th Fleet is infamous for its operational tempo. \n\n4. Mission. Part of the cause with the operational tempo, procurement, and fleet size problems is because Navy is a little lost on what, exactly, it's being called upon to do. Right now, Navy is mostly called to \"Fly the Flag\" and to be on call in the event of an emergency. But in the event of war, Navy will most likely be called upon to keep the Atlantic and/or Pac open to military shipping at the very least.

I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right size or not, but I&#39;m also just a random dude on the internet thinking about it for 2 min. and Ukraine can put hundreds of people on this for months with a budget of millions.... So I guess we just disagree.  I do see what you&#39;re saying, it just doesn&#39;t seem like a problem Ukraine can&#39;t overcome or a problem Ukraine needs western help to overcome.</p>\n</div>",

It was one of the hardest targets in terms of reaching it, in terms of the air defense and the location.\"**\n\n>It has been extremely difficult for civilians to leave the city, Fedorov added.\n\n>\"Today 150 to 200 people per day leave through Vasylivka (the only available route from occupied territory to Ukrainian-held areas) compared to 1,000 people as it was.\"\n\n>\"To leave Melitopol you need to submit an application, which is considered within a month term.

It could be east and west bank for a while, until its north and south and then everything in between.

I feel like I need to make a post on the [subject of radar horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_horizon). Earth is, by most accounts, round. Barring some non-relevant exceptions, radar cannot see through it. Radar does benefit from atmospheric refraction, which is the change of air density with altitude. For a object flying at 100 feet AGL, your best case scenario would give you a radar target visibility of around 17 miles. At 250 feet AGL this bumps up to around 24 miles, best case scenario.  That doesn't take in account about a million other variables. On top of that the 136 is a small drone, which returns a smaller radar signal.\n \nThis is fairly basic stuff. This is why many cruise missiles fly low, and aircraft, and drones, etc. Because the closer you are to the Earth the less chance of detection there is. Now while nobody knows what altitude the 136 is capable of, I'd take a guess that it flies at a relatively high altitude for maximum distance before dropping down to whatever the lowest possible altitude it can fly to avoid detection. \n\nSo unless the 136 flies at a abornmally high altitude you will need many radars, and many helo sites to provide coverage. If Russia sends the drones on the same corridors every time this is far less of a issue, but with the reported range of the 136 there is no reason to do that.",

Russia is a huge and rich country. We don't need other people's territories, we have plenty of everything. But there is our land, which is sacred for us, where our ancestors lived and where our people live today. And we will not give it to anyone. We defend our people. We are at war for all our people, for our land, for our thousand-year history.\n\nWho is fighting against us? We are fighting against those who hate us, who forbid our language, our values and even our faith, who inculcate hatred for the history of our Fatherland. Against us today is part of a dying world. They are a bunch of insane Nazi drug addicts, a nation drugged and intimidated by them, and a large pack of barking dogs from the Western kennel. With them is a motley pack of grunting gilts and small-minded philistines from a collapsed western empire with drool dripping down their chins from degeneration. They have no faith and no ideals except their own made-up obscene habits and their own two-worldly standards of thought that deny the morals granted to normal people. So by rising up against them, we have gained sacred power.\n\nWhere are our old friends? We have been abandoned by some frightened partners - and don't give a damn about them. So they weren't our friends, but just occasional traveling companions, clingers and hangers-on. Cowardly traitors and greedy renegades have gone far away - let their bones rot in a foreign land. They are not among us, and we are stronger and cleaner.\n\nWhy were we silent for so long? We have been weak and devastated by a time without time. And now we have shaken off the clammy sleep and melancholy haze of the past decades, into which the demise of the old Fatherland had plunged us. Our awakening was awaited by other countries, raped by the masters of darkness, the slave masters and oppressors, who dream of their monstrous colonial past and yearn to maintain their power over the world. Many countries have long disbelieved their delusions, but are still afraid of them. Soon they too will finally wake up. And when the decrepit world order collapses, it will bury all its haughty priests, bloodthirsty followers, sneering servants and voiceless mankurts under the thick of its rubble.\n\nWhat are our weapons? Weapons come in many forms. We have the ability to send all enemies to hellfire, but that is not our task. We listen to the words of the Creator in our hearts and obey them. These words give us a sacred purpose. The goal is to stop the supreme ruler of hell, no matter what name he uses, Satan, Lucifer or Iblis. For his purpose is destruction. Our goal is life. His weapon is an intricate lie. And our weapon is Truth. That is why our cause is right. That's why victory will be ours! Happy Holidays!",
