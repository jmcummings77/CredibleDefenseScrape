If Russia is willing to take losses like Adviika and Bakhmut, a Kursk counter offensive to retake Russian lands is easily already being planned if not opening stages being executed. We also know Ukraine, while able to inflict heavy casualties on Russian forces, have a hard time holding ground against concentrated Russian efforts, as Russia is willing to lose the men to gain the territory, and Ukraine seems to be able to slow, but not stop these large scale offensives. Hopefully new mobilization efforts have helped address the glaring manpower issues earlier this year, as well as supply from the latest US supply package. Those two variables are large factors at the moment. Hopefully they can hold the Seym River.\n\nThe immediate payoffs are pretty big, large increase in much needed Morale, removing pressure from some of the Donbas, potential bargaining chip in negotiations if they can hold it, pressuring Russian aviation, return to manuever warfare at least for a short period, proving western backers Ukraine is still capable of offensive action, and capturing Russian conscripts from the Russian core.\n\nRisks are also very high. Potential over extending of Ukrainian units that are in desperate need of reserves weakening lines elsewhere, potentially excellerating the loss of eastern oblasts lands as Ukraine gives land up to save on personnel, potential for Russian escalating retaliatory strikes increasing frequency on civilian infrastructure, potentially stress with western backers over what sent equipment is allowed to do, and lastly if they can't hold any of Kursk Oblast and get removed, Sumy isn't that great for defensive positions, and the loss of which could reverse the current morale gain.\n\nNot to say they were wrong to launch this offensive. But I see a lot of people acting as if this is an undeniable victory, and fail to see that these gains can be removed from the board at great cost to both countries.

It's only this last section that we're talking about - north and east of Korenovo the Russians can cross easily enough.\n\nBut if the UAF take Korenovo (where fighting is ongoing) and blow the bridges to the west, it may be difficult for Russian border guards and conscript garrisons - perhaps as much as a regiment's worth or so in total - to get out of that south-west corner of Kursk oblast.",

            "body": "It is still too early to determine what the Kursk operation means\u2014whether it\u2019s a flash in the pan or a strategically important development in what had become a mostly positional war of attrition. With the operation now a week old, however, it is safe to say it is not simply a border incursion similar to previous Ukrainian incursions into Russia. These are the following six observations on the current situation in Kursk:\n\nFirst, the Kursk attack is distinct in the scale of resources deployed across the border. Ukraine is using a not insignificant number of its regular military formations. In previous attacks, Ukraine relied mainly on small numbers of Russians fighting for Ukraine in units like \u201cRussia Volunteers Corps\u201d and \u201cFreedom of Russia Legion.\u201d\n\nSecond, Ukraine was extremely secretive about the operation, so much so that senior officers were left in the dark until three days before the incursion began. Previous raids were primarily public relations stunts, with photos, videos, and commentary coming out of Ukraine every day.\n\nBoth the committed resources and the secrecy suggest that the operation\u2019s goals are likely much broader than a PR splash in the headlines, even if the goals weren\u2019t initially clear.\n\nAfter a week-long media blackout, one with no major leaks or substantive comments from the country\u2019s leadership, Kyiv finally broke the silence on what it was doing: preventing Russia from sending reinforcements to the eastern front and stopping Russian cross-border strikes against Ukraine\u2019s Sumy Oblast.\n\nThird, while forcing Russia to reshuffle its troops and protecting Sumy are the two stated objectives, there might be other goals as well.\n\nUkraine could be trying to take a large number of Russian POWs to have more bodies to swap for Ukrainian hostages; videos online purport to show dozens of Russian soldiers in Kursk oblast surrendering to Ukrainians. On Aug. 9, President Volodymyr Zelensky praised Ukrainian forces for \u201creplenishing the exchange fund\u2026 over the past three days\u201d\u2014a clear allusion to the Kursk operation that began three days prior.\n\nOther objectives might be boosting the morale of Ukrainian forces and gaining a stronger negotiating position for potential ceasefire talks. Russia has enjoyed the strategic initiative for many months, and it helps Ukraine to show that it can still surprise Russia and wreak havoc on its forces.\n\nAn obvious outcome of the operation, which might have also been a goal, is highlighting Russian weaknesses to show that America\u2019s escalation fears are overblown. Ukraine and the U.S. have always been at odds with each other over escalation management, with Washington placing restrictions on the use of its weapons so as not to provoke Russia and avoid a nuclear outcome. Kyiv has said Russian nuclear blackmail is exaggerated and pushed for more long-range capabilities. And, it did so again at the Foreign Ministry\u2019s most recent press conference, directly linking the incursion to Ukraine\u2019s limited long-range capabilities.\n\nKursk might be, among other things, Ukraine\u2019s bold attempt to prove this point. In this sense, it\u2019s important to understand that the audience for this operation isn\u2019t just Russia, but also the West, and Washington in particular. Ukraine is using Western equipment to invade Russian territory and take control of more than 70 settlements, and Moscow\u2019s much-feared response is chaotic and insignificant, at least so far.\n\nFourth, the Russian reaction to the attack is telling. Russia did not expect the incursion and had no idea what to do about it for days. The Russian opposition outlet Meduza reported that the Kremlin took three days to figure out the media messaging: journalists were told to praise the successes of the Russian military and downplay the situation.\n\nPutin called the incursion \u201ca large-scale provocation\u201d and shifted responsibility to the local authorities, who imposed a counter-terrorist operation regime in Kursk Oblast and two regions near it.\n\n[ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-13-2024) reported that Russia has been relying on conscripts to respond to the attack, and \u201celements of some regular and irregular military units pulled from less critical sectors of the frontline.\u201d The\n[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/russia-withdraws-some-forces-from-ukraine-in-response-to-kursk-invasion-c0a11eee?mod=hp_lead_pos1) quoted an unnamed American official saying Russia is withdrawing its forces from other areas of the frontline to deal with Kursk.\n\nISW also said Russia is \u201cstruggling to establish the joint command and control structures necessary to coordinate operations\u201d in Kursk Oblast because the Kremlin delegated overlapping tasks to Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, the National Guard, and the Federal Security Service.\n\nFifth, amidst the panic in Russia, the American and European reactions are striking as well. Both appear supportive of Ukrainian actions\u2014which was not necessarily predictable given how skittish Western policymakers have been about anything that brings the war home to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel like this is escalatory in any way,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said during a Aug. 8 briefing. Singh asserted that the operation was within the boundaries of U.S. policy, even though U.S. officials discouraged similar incursions in the past.\n\nThe surprising rhetoric appears to be an extension of the recent policy shift, when the U.S. greenlighted Ukrainian attacks inside Russia to respond to cross-border fire, like Russia\u2019s offensive near Kharkiv.\n\nSixth, while Ukraine has made strategic gains in Kursk, continuing to hold the captured territory poses significant risks.\n\nUkraine has taken dozens of Russian POWs during the Kursk operation, and Russian officials reportedly already reached out about a prisoner swap. Ukraine has shown the world that Russia is weaker than commonly assumed, potentially shifting the U.S. approach to attacks against Russia.\n\nAt the same time, large parts of the main front are comparatively weak. Things have only gotten worse in Donetsk Oblast since the Kursk operation, as Ukraine pulled experienced soldiers from there to go into Russia. Despite the reports of Russia reshuffling its reserves, its forces kept moving forward towards the town of Toretsk, occupying several Ukrainian villages, the DeepState monitoring project shows.\n\nUkraine can withdraw from Russia to protect Ukrainian troops which might yield limited benefits. Enforcing a long-term occupation to use the land as a bargaining chip will be costly, and Ukraine is currently struggling with every type of resource.\n\nOn Aug. 15, Ukraine\u2019s top general Oleksandr Syrskyi said the military established a commandant\u2019s office in Kursk Oblast \u201cto maintain law and order and ensure the priority needs of the population in the controlled territories.\u201d Ukraine also created a hotline for Russian civilians who wish to flee to Ukraine or need humanitarian assistance.\n\nKyiv is thus signaling that it may be considering a longer-term occupation. But whether it can pull it off, and whether doing so will drain resources from other much-needed priorities in the war, is an open question.",

The S-400s kind of keep you low (roughly speaking your horizon at 3000m is going to be just shy 200kms so if the S-400 radar is 200kms from the line of contact you are going to be below 3000m altitude to avoid it).\n\nSo something like AMRAAM, say the D model. 160km-ish range. But that means if you are at optimal altitude and you release to an oncoming target its either that you can hit it as it gets to 160kms from your release point or they may be fiddling and saying it can hit the target if it continues forward if you release when its only 160kms from you.\n\nIf it move to the side or retreats its likely much closer. NASAM give a range of about 50kms so that is perhaps what the missile gets if its at 0m altitude and 0m/s velocity.\n\nBUT we dont really know the no escape zone for S400. Perhaps if you are small enough on the radar and fast enough you can come in at altitude get a shot off and get out giving the missile the kind of range you need? The S-400 no escape zone vs something shifting is likely a lot closer. But still even with a Tranche 3 Eurofighter battering in at supercruise Mach 1.5 and firing a Meteor you are going to be pretty sweaty palms at the difference between the gap where you are able to get to the no escape zone for S-400 and hitting aircraft at altitude releasing the glide bombs 60kms behind the LOC.\n\nThis is not an answer, its to map out the unknowns of the problem. And to start to help people to visualise how hard it will be to hit aircraft BVR while S-400 has such tight envelopes on where you can fly.\n\nIts a dynamic thing, you are moving very fast and very high you can get closer to the S-400 and be able to evade kinetically. But they can bring the S400 closer and risk the unit to your DEAD. You can come in low and avoid the radar (the A50s will see you) but then you lose kinetically vs the Su 24s etc releasing the glide bombs.\n\nNOW there is something you can supply that can kill at those ranges for laughs. But you need a huge radar to do it, SM-3 has rangers towards 1000kms. It has killed a freaking satellite (Operation Burn Frost). But its not really meant to beat up banged up 80s relics. Its meant as an ABM platform.\n\nYou could donate some sleek latest gen F-18Es with the AIM-174B. But well there is a lot of reasons that is not going to happen, and you will really need to work out envelopes between where you get spotted by S400s, where you can get a near guarenteed hit on the Su 24s and see if even this combo would be able to close the distance.\n\nYou could \"old school\" it place batteries of AA guns either something like VADS to kill the bombs coming it\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M167\\_VADS#Current\\_operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M167_VADS#Current_operators) (also going to really kill of the whole drone hype if something like this gets redeployed at scale) But there are no production lines for this kind of kit.\n\nUltimately you will likely be cheapest using ATACMs, JASSM and Storm Shadow to go after the S400s.

It is not e.g. credible that Russia would commit suicide by launching a nuclear attack on the US or the EU in response to a strike on a radar system, assuming they believed the strike to be limited to that system (and not e.g. the first salvo in a strategic attack).  Likewise, the US would not launch a nuclear assault on Russia if the Russians struck an American site, similarly assuming that this was not honestly perceived as part of a nuclear first strike by the Russians: as we saw from numerous incidents in the Cold War, no one is really keen on ending civilization if there are reasonable alternatives.  So most talk of Russian nuclear escalation in response to limited conventional actions is unlikely to be anything but hot air - they can say that they'll blow themselves up, but it's not credible.  OTOH, the bigger concern is that some limited conventional action might be misunderstood to be part of a first strike, triggering MAD by accident.  It seems unlikely that anything Ukraine could do would fall into that category, but I can also see why the US has wanted to bend over backwards to ensure clarity on that front.

As many noted at the time (with a profound sense of frustration and disbelief), the Ukrainians didn't properly fortify their flanks at Avdiivka OR set up a proper fall back line. This was doubly problematic as Ukraine was both massively outnumbered and outgunned on this front, and proper fortifications would have done wonders to reduce these Russian advantages.\n\nSo after Avdiivka fell, Russia has slowly but surely advanced through one hastily erected line of defense after another. As the breach grew, Ukrainian forces were also increasingly stretched needing to cover longer lines, which weakened areas where they did have meaningful defensive fortifications such as at Niu York.\n\nDespite the considerable Russian advantages on this front however, it's still been a slow, grinding, costly fight for their forces over the course of nearly a year. Even in places where Ukrainian forces are extremely weak, the Russians are incapable of rapid maneuver at scale. If the Russians were capable of that, the danger on this front would be extreme, but without that risk, the Ukrainians are able to continue to slowly trade territory for time, all while bleeding Russian forces along the way.

Once they're stopped, then counterattack to retake ground if possible. If not, improve defensive positions and settle into a deliberate defense. \n\nDefending forces set up road blocks with cover and concealment nearby to key tactical and operational locations their larger unit is tasked to defend (key towns out cities, road intersections, bridges, etc). There they will need to plan and coordinate a kill zone/fire sack where everyone will fire into, and then wait for the enemy to approach. While they're waiting, they should be improving their positions. \n\nTypically they're placed on the main roads first, those will be priority because that's what the attacker will want to travel on, they're big and wide and easiest to move the most traffic on and they lead to key areas, and they have the best bridges along the way. If the attacking enemy is bypassing those main roads, more defending units will need to be moved to defend auxiliary roads too and even trails. If they don't have enough units to block all the routes, the attacker keeps moving forward.\n\nIf the attacker keeps running into resistance they don't want to overcome with a slow and lengthy fight, and further attempts to bypass are made but thwarted by more defensive blocking positions, that remove gaps for the attacking forces to exploit, and that's how a defensive line is created. Maneuver breaks down because there is no easy path to take, turning the front into positional fighting, and the only way forward requires creating a breach with a deliberate attack by delib highly planned and choreographed set piece battles starting with the combined arms breach.\n\nAs I said, defenders are always supposed to improve their positions if they're not moving. So they'll dig in, tie in their flanks, lay obstacles including mines, etc. The more time they are stationary, the more elaborate the defenses get. \n\nContinued in Part 2",

If they don&#39;t have enough units to block all the routes, the attacker keeps moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>If the attacker keeps running into resistance they don&#39;t want to overcome with a slow and lengthy fight, and further attempts to bypass are made but thwarted by more defensive blocking positions, that remove gaps for the attacking forces to exploit, and that&#39;s how a defensive line is created. Maneuver breaks down because there is no easy path to take, turning the front into positional fighting, and the only way forward requires creating a breach with a deliberate attack by delib highly planned and choreographed set piece battles starting with the combined arms breach.</p>\n\n<p>As I said, defenders are always supposed to improve their positions if they&#39;re not moving. So they&#39;ll dig in, tie in their flanks, lay obstacles including mines, etc. The more time they are stationary, the more elaborate the defenses get. </p>\n\n<p>Continued in Part 2</p>\n</div>",

Instead, to find out what's in front of them, besides SIGINT, HUMINT, IMINT, they'll punch out dedicated scouts/recon or conventional tank-mech/motor infantry unit typically in platoon strength, occasionally company strength if they're anticipating trouble, doing movement-to-contact/reconnaissance-in-force missions, \"Drive to x location (typically a village/town/city, bridge, or other important objective in the distance)\" and report back on the route, in terms of the quality of the roads, enemy resistance, civilians on the battlefield (who might be clogging roads), etc.\n\nIf those recon units run into contact they're supposed to punch through if resistance is light, bypass if it's heavy and find another route forward to reach their objective, or fix the defending enemy in place, coordinating fire and maneuver to overcome them themselves, or waiting for reinforcements to assist.\n\nOn the attack, maneuver force leaders are HIGHLY encouraged by doctrine to push as hard as possible to try to exploit speed and surprise to achieve more success, to not give the defenders time to respond, develop a coordinated defense, or plan counterattacks. This forces them into a position where they MUST aggressively commit subordinate forces to push ahead, ignore caution, go go go. This is the point where they'll sacrifice logistics, cohesion, readiness, etc to try to make more gains, where it's fully acceptable to take those risks because the enemy situation is often worse than the attacker. \n\nBut if the defending force can start getting their stuff together, put together a combat ready force that is able to communicate, and higher HQ can actually plan somethinthey don't need to retreat anymore and can start trying to halt the attacker's advanced. To do that, in this sort of highly motorized maneuver warfare, they'll start by setting up blocking positions targeting the attacking lead elements, especially those conducting the recon in force, using ambushes when surprise is possible, a deliberate defense when it's not. \n\nIf surprise is maintained and the ambush is so successful that it destroys the entire attacking force, that's the best response. Not just for the sake of attrition, but because the higher HQ for the attacking force won't have a clue what happened, where, why, how, or anything else. They'll just know that units aren't responding to comms, maybe a GPS icon on an interactive digital map disappears too. The only way to find out what happened is to send out another unit to find out what happened to the first one, send a drone, etc. But all that takes time to organize and upsets their tempo and planning cycle and the more that happens the less likely their plan works. \n\nIf some forces make it out of ambush, the recon unit still accomplished its mission, it found the enemy and knows the status of the route they're using: it's blocked. But because of the way they found out, blundering into an ambush and taking heavy losses, it likely won't tell their higher HQ much. Was the enemy actually defending in great strength or did they only perform a successful ambush with surprise that'll only work once? To get more answers, the attacking higher HQ will probably order more recon in force missions, with more assets to find out, order a deliberate attack, order the next unit to bypass that position and try another route, etc. But again, they're burning time, and time equals better defenses. \n\nIf the recon unit is good at their job, properly spaced out, alert, performing bounding overwatch, using drones, using thermals, etc, there is a good chance that only a small portion of the column gets ambushed, or maybe none of it. However, that approach is slower than just going balls out driving down a highway, requires more highly skilled forces, so is often less used than simply conducting a bread and butter movement to contact.\n\nThe OSINT maps will generally tell you everything you need to know about how this offensive is going, you don't need drone footage of successful Russian defensive stands. If the Ukrainian axes can still expand outwards they're either still finding gaps in the Russian defenses or they're punching through the defensive roadblocks. If they are halted on any axis that they've previously been making headway, they're either too logistically strained to keep going, higher HQ redirected units to a different axis or mission, or they can't find gaps/can't punch through them and are bogged down into a situation that if unchanged turns into a positional fight. If their axes are shortening, the Ukrainians are retreating, either because they don't want to hold that much ground, they can't logistically support those distances, or they were driven back with Russian counterattacks.\n\nEverything I wrote applies especially to the first 3 weeks of this war back in Feb-Mar 2022. The Russians were stopped with roadblocks that initially acted as ambushes and eventually stabilized into lines when the Russians couldn't advance further and the Ukrainians couldn't push them back further with counterattacks.",
