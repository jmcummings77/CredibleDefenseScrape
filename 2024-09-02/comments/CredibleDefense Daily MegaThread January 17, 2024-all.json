Concerning 122mm and 152mm howitzers, the main restraint is posed by the number of shells, and not by the number of the guns, afaik. Same goes for 105mm guns. This actually applies to 155mm howitzers as well at the moment, but this could change in the future, considering the potential large increase in Western production of 155mm shells from 2025 too. Attrition is significant, mainly because of the Lancets, and the rates of fire in the summer have caused wear in the barrels of a certain portion of the guns. There was an interview in which artillerymen from the 47th Mechanized Brigade complained that the accuracy of their M109A6 had decreased significantly. So new barrels are definitely needed. \n\nIn the future, European countries will be able to send newly produced howitzers, but  almost all of those in stock have already been delivered. For example, my country, Italy, gave Ukraine 140+ 155mm howitzers (largely M109L), but today we can no longer give anything without taking guns away from the operational artillery units of our brigades and we don't produce new howitzers. France and Germany, on the other hand, can help: production volumes of CAESARs have been multiplied and are going to be very relevant for Ukraine. Germany will deliver new RCH 155s and also has active PzH-2000 production line. Poland with the Krabs and Slovakia with the Zuzanas will also be able to help. The West's largest friendly producer in this field is South Korea, but they don't send directly guns to Ukraine. Although they have helped anyway: the delivery of the K9 Thunders to Estonia allowed all Estonian FH-70s to be sent to Ukraine. It would also be great to resume M777s production as some rumors say: the Ukrainians need both self-propelled howitzers to shoot and then run away, but also towed howitzers that can be very well hidden in forest belts and remain in a fixed position. This is due to the fact that Russian counterbattery is in fact Lancets, rather than artillery fire. Finally, Ukrainians stated they've started producing 6 2S22 Bohdanas per month and are also going to start producing the towed version with the same barrel. That would be very good news! \n>I would like to use this opportunity to thank you for your insightful and detailed comments on this sub, portraying the situation at the front.\n\nMy pleasure, thank you!",

She said Ukrainian officials offered to jury-rig the weapons themselves, in the interest of time, \u201cbecause for the winter period we need desperately the air defenses, and this is what is going to be used.\u201d  \n>  \n>But American engineers insisted on doing the work, and they needed more than seven months to test and approve the mash-up after the Pentagon agreed in January to provide Sea Sparrow missiles for the project.

(Of course this is a politicians statement and is reliant on her assessment, *or at least the assessment she wants to put out there publicly* of how easy or quickly Ukrainians could have retrofitted these same launchers if they had more control over the program, this wouldn't be the first time that she's come out with relatively \"PRSpeak\" statements on donations so whilst its interesting I'd take this aspect with a grain of salt).\n\nThe numbers are more interesting however, according to this Ukraine had already received the first retrofitted BUK/Sparrow FrankenSAM launchers back during October of last year, perhaps Ukrainians have been testing them on their own in the meantime or maybe it's just taken this long for a target to cross over one of the relatively small number of FrankenSAM's they have in operation. The system only has a supposed range of 15-20km so if they have very few of them in active service then it's not entirely surprising that it maybe took this long for a Russian target to enter its engagement radius.\n\nShe also states that whilst they had received their first BUK based FrankenSAM's (in October) they were ready to send an additional 17 BUK launchers for conversion in the US, but were hampered by the 5 units a month run rate of US production. Ukraine has probably 60 or so remaining operational launchers once you discount losses. If this 5 month run rate is accurate then it implies pretty heavily that these launchers will not complete retrofitting until after winter.\n\nLets say optimistically, based on her description of \"a few\", that at the end of October Ukraine had received 5 retrofitted BUK launchers, with an additional monthly run rate of 5 units then Ukraine could possibly have maybe 20 launchers by the end of this month, this is of course assuming that they have remained on track and also assuming that they didn't choose to keep the launchers in place with whatever limited stocks of 9M38M1 missiles they had remaining in case the winter missile campaign was more severe than it seems to currently be.\n\nThis also doesn't reflect well on their 9M38/M1 stocks if nearly a third of their BUK's are in a position to be withdrawn and retrofitted for Sparrows, but this is hardly surprising, we already knew that ex-soviet missile stocks were running dangerously low for quite some time now and that's the entire reason for being for this program in the first place. Eventually Ukraine were due to run out of missiles regardless.\n\n>A Pentagon official said on Wednesday that a test flight of the system this month, conducted at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, successfully hit the drone it had targeted. The system is scheduled to be sent to Ukraine this winter, the official said, accompanied by donated missiles and other Patriot parts from multiple allies.\n\nThis is another relevant and interesting bit on Patriot FrankenSAM conversion which implies that the winter target may have been for this Patriot system considering the BUK based systems have been in Ukrainian hands since October.\n\nWhat's probably more relevant here is that we still don't know what precisely shot down that A-50 a few days ago, and we know from this article that Patriot/S-300 radar integration isn't just a concept or early on in their integration efforts, it was successfully tested at White Sands and has been a reality for several months now according to this article.\n\nWe still won't know what shot down that A-50 until either the Ukrainians provide evidence of the specific system (which they're unlikely to do for obvious and understandable reasons) or until Russia admits the loss (good luck with that) so I guess we'll be caught in this unending speculation for quite some time, but at least from my view this lends some credence to the suggestions that a Patriot FrankenSAM paired with the S-300 radar possibly made that shot.",

It&#39;s entirely possible, however slim, that he would still support Ukraine, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and I think the other potential electoral ramifications might change the makeup of the senate or the house enough to further complicate the aid situation, but I don&#39;t think we can entirely blanket discount it just yet given he&#39;s known to be erratic and really I don&#39;t think anyone knows, not even himself, what way he&#39;s going to swing on an issue until he&#39;s actually making the decision.</p>\n</div>",

We hear about tension in Russian regions all the time and yet nothing really ever seems to come of it. Whilst our look behind the curtain isn't very complete, I think it's safe to assume given their prevalence at information control that Russia regularly exploits these tensions, or perhaps even pushes them itself in some cases to expose potential weaknesses and keep a lid on the whole dumpster fire.   \n\n\nI don't doubt that there has to be some level of dissent in these regions, you can't go to war and just expect the entire population to be happy about it, especially those directly impacted by the war (losing loved ones/family and those directly economically impacted by the upheaval) but I see these stories crop up all the time and I'd imagine some degree of this is exploitation of these situations to keep tabs on the depth of that dissent and re-emphasize control to the local population.   \n\n\nThis isn't to discount the fact Russians are just generally quite patriotic and relatively Pro-War in the context of Ukraine, it's for this reason that I don't see these tensions as amounting to much in the short term and particularly not as you noted in this specific region given its geography. Anything is possible if this war drags on long enough and domestic support crumbles, but right now it seems that domestic support is surprisingly strong (granted polls are incredibly unreliable in authoritarian countries, but it's all we really have to go on).",

Reportedly, this *really* pissed off the US, including President Bush himself, and contributed to the Obama administration drastically scaling back US-Israeli intelligence cooperation against Iran.\n\nIt is an interesting snapshot of covert/intelligence activities and unconventional warfare. I wonder how high-up the orders in Mossad came from on this effort, or if it was a big of a \"rogue\" operation - I'm guessing not, given how high-level the controversy got.

When a false flag is being done to frame someone, you'd be doing something flashy enough that it would be clear to everyone who the perpetrator was, which isn't the case here.\n\nThe \"false flag\" is the part that the US took offense with (and hence what's noteworthy to Foreign Policy).

They apparently didn\u2019t give a damn what we thought.\u201d\n\nThe article then goes on to cite two reports of direct sponsorship of the CIA to Jundallah : \n\n> A spate of stories in 2007 and 2008, including a report by ABC News and a New Yorker article, suggested that the United States was offering covert support to Jundallah. The issue has now returned to the spotlight with the string of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists and has outraged serving and retired intelligence officers who fear that Israeli operations are endangering American lives.\n\nAnd then follows with an account that, at that time, Rigi admitted to a meeting with who he thought were NATO officials, but who he later said (though under duress) were either Americans or Israelis:\n\n> Rigi was interrogated, tried, and convicted by the Iranians and hanged on June 20, 2010. Prior to his execution, Rigi claimed in an interview with Iranian media \u2014 which has to be assumed was under duress \u2014 that he had doubts about U.S. sponsorship of Jundallah. He recounted an alleged meeting with \u201cNATO officials\u201d in Morocco in 2007 that raised his suspicions. \u201cWhen we thought about it we came to the conclusion that they are either Americans acting under NATO cover or Israelis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe subtext being that this meeting probably was indeed with Israelis, and that they were probably directly sponsoring Jundallah.\n\nThis is furthered, in the article, by CIA memos regarding alleged CIA sponsorship of Jundallah, which imply that the sponsorship was in fact by Israel : \n\n> The memos, as described by the sources, one of whom has read them and another who is intimately familiar with the case, investigated and debunked reports from 2007 and 2008 accusing the CIA, at the direction of the White House, of covertly supporting Jundallah \u2014 a Pakistan-based Sunni extremist organization. Jundallah, according to the U.S. government and published reports, is responsible for assassinating Iranian government officials and killing Iranian women and children.\n\n> But while the memos show that the United States had barred even the most incidental contact with Jundallah, according to both intelligence officers, the same was not true for Israel\u2019s Mossad. The memos also detail CIA field reports saying that Israel\u2019s recruiting activities occurred under the nose of U.S. intelligence officers, most notably in London, the capital of one of Israel\u2019s ostensible allies, where Mossad officers posing as CIA operatives met with Jundallah officials.\n\nIt seems pretty clear to me that the report is about Mossad trying to use the CIA in order to further their recruiting/alliance with Jundallah officials, not to implicate the US. The article never says that the purpose of this was to implicate the US.\n\nYou may be confused by the term \"false flag\".

Everything else is more or less in line with the trends observed so far:\n\n\\- According to surveys, 2023 was a noticeably better year for Russians than 2022.\n\n\\- Two-thirds of respondents say that 2023 was \u201caverage\u201don the whole, while another 20% called it \u201cgood.\u201d In addition, two-thirds consider it rather successful \u2013 the highest figure since 2000.\n\n\\- The main events of the year were rising prices, Vladimir Putin\u2019s announcement of another presidential run, the \u201cspecial operation,\u201d the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the school shooting in Bryansk, Putin\u2019s annual call-in show, the earthquake in Turkey, rising salaries and pensions, the march on Moscow by Wagner and the subsequent death of Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\n\\- Over the past 1.5-2.0 years in Russia there has been a noticeable increase in the share of people who, in their own estimation, can afford to buy relatively expensive things, such as a TV or refrigerator. Whereas in 2020-21 the average annual figure was about 24%, in 2022 it rose to 27% and then 29% in 2023. Meanwhile, the size of the well-off segment of the population did not change significantly.\n\n\\- To quote one of our respondents who was asked what exactly has improved in her life recently: \u201c\u2018My son is at war, he sends money.\u2019 Apparently, these are the people who can buy today what they could not afford yesterday.\n\n\\- The most anxious rich and Westernized Russians from cities went abroad, while those who remained had enough resources to find their way in the new reality - in this segment too, however, positive assessments predominated throughout 2023.\n\n\\- There is high support for the government - this is very similar to the so-called \u201cCrimea effect\u201d \u2013 when widespread support for the regime was observed for several years after the first stage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict back in 2014.

We know the Russian losses, roughly, but how bad are the Ukrainian losses?  Infantry losses matter too. They're not light, they do get hit crossing the river a lot.  Moreso, do we even know how many marine losses would be worth it?  Like, how many marines would you trade for a BMD?  It's not a simple question.\n\nBut there are other reasons, that I've outlined before but I'll do so again:\n\nKrynky is a setpiece battle reminiscent of the 19th century.  Unlike say Bakhmut or Avdiivka, if Ukraine chooses to not have a battle there, there won't be a battle there.  So the question is, does Ukraine **need** a setpiece battle at Krynky right now?  Given they're trying to reduce the intensity of the war to rebuild their forces?  I think not.\n\nSecondly, it's terrible for morale, especially now that the NYT's interviewed the boys on the ground.  People really don't like being used as basically cannon fodder in order to bait Russians into attacking, even if there's a tactical utility.  And now that's spreading throughout the Ukrainian military and society.\n\nThirdly, let's face it, Ukraine has a mediocre record when it comes to knowing when it's time to retreat.  This reroutes back to my first point - we don't know if the ratio is overwhelmingly positive.  We have to trust Ukraine that they are, and given previous overcommits, not everyone does.\n\nAnyway, this is a bit abridged and I should eventually type up a longer thing.\n\nWhile the URR perspective that the Ukrainians are just doing this for nothing is wrong, I'm not convinced the actual things Ukrainians are achieving are worth it.
