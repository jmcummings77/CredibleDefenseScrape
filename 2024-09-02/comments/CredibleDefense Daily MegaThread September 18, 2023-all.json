As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The Fleet\u2019s exercise, called Unmanned Systems Integrated Battle Problem (UxS IBP) 23.1, is a tactical warfighting rehearsal event conducted by U.S. 3rd Fleet headquartered in San Diego, California to test and develop fleet-centric concepts and capabilities, according to the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn mid-August, four U.S. Navy unmanned surface fleets, Mariner, Ranger, Sea Hunter, and Seahawk, were seen heading to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s USVs are part of Ghost Fleet Overlord, a prototyping program launched in 2018 to integrate multi-mission unmanned vessels into the fleet. Its sister ships, Ranger and Mariner, were also commissioned by the U.S. Navy as part of a Department of Defense project to bring autonomous navigation technology to maritime vessels.\n\nThe two vessels were developed in collaboration between the US defense technology company Leidos and the US shipyard Gulf Craft.\n\nTwo sister vessels measure 193 feet (59 meters) long and 32 feet (10 meters) wide. It maintains cargo carrying capacity of two 20-foot containers and four 40-foot containers, but the containers are often equipped with additional systems and sensors essential to the vessel\u2019s operation. It is equipped with Lockheed Martin\u2019s Aegis combat system and can link with other Aegis ships in the fleet. So far, it has conducted test firings of the SM-6 interceptor missile.\n\nAccording to a Baird Maritime report published on November 30, 2022,  both Mariner and Ranger utilize a design that was originally developed for fast crew transfer and supply duties in support of clients in the offshore oil and gas industry. Modifications on each boat include the addition of satellite communications, three radars of different bands, electro-optical and infrared sensors, and radios.\n\nYokosuka, the home port of the U.S. Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet, is bustling with activity on September 18. Besides Mariner and Ranger, the Independence-variant littoral combat ship (LCS) USS Oakland (LCS 24) also made a rate port call at Yokosuka.\n\nThese ships\u2019 visit to Yokosuka may be aimed at showcasing American defense co-operation with Japan.",

DAPA did not provide details on the new weapon's specifications, but it is expected to have a range of over 300 km.\n\nStill, the DAPA official declined to provide details on the penetration capabilities of both the existing and new systems, citing operational security.\n\nThe state-run Agency for Defense Development will oversee the project, which is set to run through the end of 2027, with major defense companies taking part in producing prototype models.",

Eventually lights go out and there\u2019s no water and no internet/ news / networks. Looting starts. First casualties in a hospital look how you would expect but eventually they run out medical supplies, have no painkillers so cut people screaming in pain, they have no antibiotics so can\u2019t fight sepsis and have to amputate limbs. Doctors spend weeks in hospital without a chance to go home because there\u2019s endless stream of casualties.

They primarily use your transponder (mode 3/c or S or ADS-B) to track position. Military fighters have resisted going with S or any form of ADS-B so if he ejected and mode 3 was off (which can also happen as part of local operating procedure) theyd have little idea where it was if it continued on auto pilot in a remotely populated area",

            "body": "There simply aren't any high quality short-range air defense (SHORAD) systems well-suited to Ukraine's needs in existence right now. Because most systems capable of countering small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) are either in development now or just wrapped up development within the recent past. The dramatic need for better mobile ground-based SHORAD is one of the few lessons learned from the war at this relatively early point in time that I would be comfortable taking and applying more broadly to other countries and to potential future conflicts. Other possible lessons learned show greater signs of potentially being limited to the peculiar conditions of this specific war, but it's clear that no one yet has an M-SHORAD platform that has sufficient capabilities to address the full, increasingly wide range of aerial threats present on the modern battlefield.\n\nThe US has Avengers (which are basically just HMMWVs with a machine gun and a few stingers mounted on the back), but the Army identified a capability gap a few years ago in terms of its ability to counter UASs because Avengers are not well-armored and thus not well-suited for keeping up with an armored column under combat conditions. The weaponry is also not well suited for targeting sUASs because stingers are expensive and not great at tracking really small vehicles, and the machine gun doesn't have the best optics for the task either.\n\nC-RAM systems are also not in any way a silver bullet for SHORAD, although it is of course impressively effective as a last line of defense against missile attacks. Phalanx CIWS, for example, has never been produced at large scale so there are only a few dozen in existence, none of which can be spared for a relatively unimportant task like guarding a single fixed location. The system is also based on 1960s tech, has extremely expensive ammo, is not a ground mobile platform (although there is a land-based immobile variant/turret), and is extremely short ranged, with a maximum effective firing range of 1.5km. It's also insanely expensive to acquire on a per unit basis. Each Phalanx costs something around $12m compared to around $8m for each of the new SHORAD Strykers (based on the $1.2b purchase price quoted for 144 of them). \n\nTo fill this capability gap, the US Army ordered the new SHORAD Stryker variant as a temporary measure until a more permanent M-SHORAD solution can be developed. The SHORAD Strykers offer pretty much the same AD capabilities as Avengers (primarily stingers) but built on an armored vehicle chassis and with upgraded optics, fire control systems, and a 30mm autocannon remote weapons station that should give it an edge against sUAS compared to the manually aimed Avenger .50 cal.\n\nIn part, the Army picked the Stryker option because Directed Energy Weapons are currently being developed to help provide counter sUAS AD and it isn't worth investing in a new AD platform when the plan is to build the entire next gen platform around DEWs. The DoD has also made pretty solid progress on its DEW projects, and have already achieved sufficient power levels for counter sUAS applications and possibly even for SHORAD against planes, helicopters, and artillery shells, but the DoD hopes to scale the power levels much farther in the next few years in order to develop DEWs to the point that they can be used for ballistic and hypersonic missile defense as well. Notably, DEWs are incredibly cheap to operate, with costs in the low single digit dollars per shot. With one shot per intercept too, versus hundreds or thousands of $20-ish rounds per intercept for existing C-RAM solutions. So the cost savings should be dramatic.\n\nOf course none of this relates to Ukraine or its defense requirements directly. Rather, the reason the US can't provide Ukraine with an effective C-RAM equivalent for M-SHORAD is because the US does not have any such capability at the moment even for its own needs. However, although no DEW SHORAD platform is ready for immediate mass production, US DEW technology is maturing rapidly and, from a defense acquisitions perspective, it is almost certainly worth spending a few years ramping up DEW capabilities rather than throwing money at SPAAGs or other interim solutions that will be outdated within a handful of years. [According to the Congressional Research Service,](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2021-09-28_R46925_17d6925657872ab84eae6aa3164bec3c355adec3.pdf)\n\n> The [DEW] roadmap outlines DOD\u2019s plan to increase power levels of HEL weapons from around 150 kilowatt (kW), as is currently feasible, to around 300 kW by FY2022, 500 kW by FY2024, and 1 megawatt (MW) by FY2030. For reference, although no consensus exists regarding the precise power level that would be needed to neutralize different target sets, DOD briefing documents (see Figure 2) suggest that a laser of approximately 100 kW could engage\nUASs, rockets, artillery, and mortars, whereas a laser of around 300 kW could additionally engage small boats and cruise missiles flying in certain profiles (i.e., flying across\u2014rather than at\u2014the laser). Lasers of 1 MW could potentially neutralize ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons.\n\nNone of this helps Ukraine, of course. But it's worth recognizing that the US is in a weird transition period where it temporarily lacks the SHORAD capabilities that Ukraine needs right now, so its failure to deliver such capabilities is not a matter of malice or incompetence, but rather of bad timing.",

The weapon\u2019s payload of metal fragments struck a market, piercing windows and walls and wounding some victims beyond recognition.\n> \n> Less than two hours later, President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed Russian \u201cterrorists\u201d for the attack, and many media outlets followed suit. Throughout its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has repeatedly and systematically attacked civilians and struck schools, markets and residences as a deliberate tactic to instill fear in the populace. In Kostiantynivka in April, they shelled homes and a preschool, killing six.\n> \n> But evidence collected and analyzed by The New York Times, including missile fragments, satellite imagery, witness accounts and social media posts, strongly suggests the catastrophic strike was the result of an errant Ukrainian air defense missile fired by a Buk launch system.\n> \n> The attack appears to have been a tragic mishap. Air defense experts say missiles like the one that hit the market can go off course for a variety of reasons, including an electronic malfunction or a guidance fin that is damaged or sheared off at the time of launch.\n> \n> The likely missile failure happened amid the back-and-forth battles common in the surrounding area. Russian forces shelled Kostiantynivka the night before; Ukrainian artillery fire from the city was reported in a local Telegram group just minutes before the strike on the market.\n> \n> A spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said the country\u2019s security service is investigating the incident, and under national law can\u2019t comment further.\n> \n> Ukrainian authorities initially tried to prevent journalists with The Times from accessing the missile debris and impact area in the strike\u2019s immediate aftermath. But the reporters were eventually able to get to the scene, interview witnesses and collect remnants of the weapon used.  \n> \n> **The Strike**\n> \n> Security camera footage shows that the missile flew into Kostiantynivka from the direction of Ukrainian-held territory, not from behind Russian lines.\n> \n> \n> As the sound of the approaching missile is heard, at least four pedestrians appear to simultaneously turn their heads toward the incoming sound. They face the camera \u2014 in the direction of Ukrainian-held territory. Moments before it strikes, the missile\u2019s reflection is visible as it passes over two parked cars, showing it traveling from the northwest.    \n> \n> The missile\u2019s warhead detonates a few yards above the ground shortly before impact, blasting metal fragments outward. The resulting crater and damage extending from the point of detonation is consistent with a missile coming from a northwesterly route, according to an explosives expert and a Times analysis.  \n> \n> **A Suspected Ukrainian Launch Site**  \n> \n> Further evidence reveals that minutes before the strike, the Ukrainian military launched two surface-to-air missiles toward the Russian front line from the town of Druzhkivka, 10 miles northwest of Kostiantynivka.\n> \n> Reporters with The Times were in Druzhkivka when they heard an outgoing missile launch at 2 p.m., followed a few minutes later by a second. By chance, one member of the team recorded the first launch in a voice message.  \n> \n> Residents in Druzhkivka also reported an outgoing launch at that time on a local Telegram group. \u201cOne more,\u201d a post at 2:03 p.m. said, referring to a second missile launch. Locals near the launches described them as abnormally loud \u2014 beyond the sounds of war they have become accustomed to \u2014 which tracks with witness accounts of past Buk launches.\n> \n> The timing of these launches is consistent with the time frame for the missile that struck the market in Kostiantynivka, around 2:04 p.m.  \n> \n> Additionally, two witnesses who spoke to The Times said they saw the missiles being fired from Druzhkivka in the direction of the Russian front line around the time of the strike; one of them said he saw the missiles going in the direction of Kostiantynivka. A Ukrainian soldier stationed in Druzhkivka, who asked to remain anonymous, also said he heard two missile launches at around the same time.\n> \n> One of the witnesses also said the missiles were launched from fields on the outskirts of the town, a place residents say is used by the Ukrainian military and from which they have previously seen air defense missiles.  \n> \n> Times reporters who visited the site saw indications that it had recently been used by the military, including trenches, trash pits and wide tracks consistent with a large military vehicle.\n> \n> Another key indicator: scorch marks. Various ground-launched air defense missiles are fired from the rear of a large vehicle and burn the surrounding turf when they are fired. Analysis of before-and-after satellite imagery shows new scorch marks around the trenches on the day of the strike, possibly indicating that the site was used for launching missiles.  \n> \n> **The Missile**\n> \n> In the aftermath of the attack, Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces used a missile fired by an S-300 air defense system, which Russia has used both to intercept aircraft and strike targets on the ground. But an S-300 missile carries a different warhead from the one that exploded in Kostiantynivka.\n> \n> The metal facades of buildings closest to the explosion were perforated with hundreds of square or rectangular holes, probably made by cube-like objects blown outward from the missile.\n> \n> Measurements of the holes \u2014 and fragments found at the scene \u2014 are consistent in size and shape with one weapon in particular: the 9M38 missile, which is fired by the mobile Buk antiaircraft vehicle. Ukraine is known to use the Buk system, as is Russia.\n> \n> Some of the holes are less than 10 millimeters in width, while others are slightly larger. The 9M38 contains two different sizes of solid-metal cubic fragments: eight millimeters and 13 millimeters across.  \n> \n> A Times reporter also reviewed other missile fragments recovered from multiple locations in Ukraine that had been fired by Russian S-300, S-400 and Buk air defense systems, as well as two different American air defense systems. Their shapes and measurements show that the damage at the market site was most likely caused by an 9M38.\n> \n> Two independent military bomb-disposal experts, who asked to remain anonymous so they could speak candidly, came to the same conclusion and said that the fragments and damage at the strike site are most consistent with an 9M38.\n> \n> Several witnesses either heard or saw Ukrainian forces firing surface-to-air missiles from Druzhkivka toward Kostiantynivka at the time of the market strike. And evidence collected at the market shows that the missile came from that direction.\n> \n> Why the missile, which has a maximum range of just over 17 miles, may have landed in Kostiantynivka is unclear \u2014 though it\u2019s possible it malfunctioned and crashed before hitting its intended target.\n> \n> In any case, at such a short range \u2014 less than 10 miles \u2014 the missile is most likely to have landed with unspent fuel in its rocket motor, which would detonate or burn upon impact, offering a possible explanation for the widespread scorch marks at the market.",

This is not just a standalone move, this is part of an ongoing campaign to reopen more positive and productive diplomatic relations with Iran, something that has absolutely been in the toilet for the last six years. As much as Iran is antagonistic, their position as a regional power is undeniable and they are consistently attempting to flex their muscles on the international stage as well. War with Iran is not really a viable option for the US and not something that anyone should want. It would be difficult and costly and pivot US security interests away from what have now be deemed more critical areas, namely China and the (somewhat) resurgent threat of Russia. So if war is not an option, then the US either could ignore Iran or try and deal with them diplomatically. Unfortunately, any chance of dealing with Iran \"normally\" has been sunk since the first day of the Trump admin and ignoring them simply takes US influence out of the equation, which seems passive and dangerous in and of itself. In reopening this deal, the US has not only freed US citizens from captivity but also managed to open the door to negotiations again on future issues.\n\nIn truth, Biden has picked an excellent time to make this kind of overture. Saudi Arabia's relationship with the US is rocky and it doesn't hurt to remind them that they are not the only game in town. Same goes with Israel. Iran's relationship with Russia is strained despite the public displays. The fact that Russia overpromised and underdelivered on the jets it was going to send as part of the repayment for the drones Iran has sent them did not go well. Russia's overtures to DPRK are also, I would argue, evidence as a pivot away from Iran as a future weapons supplier, which is probably frustrating considering Iran has basically stuck its neck out for Russia when it comes to Ukraine. The US is following up on the tension to show Iran that we are not unreasonable and, unlike Russia, might actually be willing to back up what it says (again, a major issue of what Trump did was the lack of trust it established).\n\nI think it's important to remember that a realistic position to aspire to with Iran is to have them being a contributing member of the international community that can actually be dealt with, instead of a radical antagonist driven to take extremist actions for relevancy and attention (see DPRK). However much the government of Iran is awful in and of itself, the likelihood of the regime's collapse is low. Therefore, the US should take steps to at least keep Iran in a position where it can actually meet with them, instead of just hating one another and doing a constant will they, won't they war dance.  \n\n\nEDIT: I have no doubt that the GOP and even some Democrats will try and float this as some sort of terrible, kowtowing to terrorists or whatever.

There *was* a way to maybe make the withdrawal \"better\" with regard to SIVs, but that would have required, IMO, announcing a troop surge *before* the withdrawal announcement (or maybe in concert with it, at the latest).\n\nThe frustrating thing is they should have known better, but no one did. Even McKenzie and the ambassador thought they'd have more time until the Taliban were literally right outside Kabul, with some of them already in the city. By that point, the ANA wouldn't have been of much help, regardless of whether or not Ghani is reassured by US troops and sticks around, so we'd basically be sending troops into a city that's under siege, and you can bet that the body count would have been much higher than 13. Sucks that it went down the way it did, but I genuinely believe everyone was caught off-guard by how quickly the Taliban seized most of the country, and there were no good options at that point.",

By that point, the ANA wouldn&#39;t have been of much help, regardless of whether or not Ghani is reassured by US troops and sticks around, so we&#39;d basically be sending troops into a city that&#39;s under siege, and you can bet that the body count would have been much higher than 13. Sucks that it went down the way it did, but I genuinely believe everyone was caught off-guard by how quickly the Taliban seized most of the country, and there were no good options at that point.</p>\n</div>",

So now we can&#39;t trade it as part of the deal?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>$6b is a small price to pay for the shot at cutting the flow of those weapons off</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t have any proof that happened.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>$6b seems like a small price to restart that peace process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t have any proof that happened.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>All the rest of the bullshit youre on is just hyperbolic partisan political peacocking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re free to characterize it as such.  I think you should instead do a better job refuting my actual points.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: and also, I think I should make this clear because some of your attacks seem to allege otherwise - I&#39;m pro normalization.  As I said at the start, there&#39;s two routes, normalization and rivalry (and this trade seems to suck for both).  And I&#39;m definitely pro normalization, for now.</p>\n</div>",

Sikh separatist movement, had a long history. The movement culminated in 1984, when the Indian government demanded that Sikh temples should stop sheltering militants. The temples refused, so in June 1984, the Indian Armed Forces stormed the Golden Temple, the holiest temple of Sikhism. The storming is called Operation Blue Star.\n\nThat was right after the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan, so there was a lot of Sikh pilgrims in the temple, and many of them died during the storming. Due to this, and also the extensive damage to the Golden Temple itself, many Sikhs were furious. Ultimately, in October of the same year, prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards of hers.\n\nThe assassination of the prime minister caused uproar in all of India. Thousands of Sikhs were massacred in the ensuing anti-Sikh riots.\n\nThe Sikhs and the Hindu majority in India have had a large blood feud since. Modi, as a radical Hindutva nationalist, certainly has the intent to assassinate a Sikh separatist.\n\n\\---\n\nLet us go back to why Trudeau made it public.
