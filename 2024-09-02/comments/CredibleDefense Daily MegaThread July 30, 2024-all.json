That thing is so old that, in some cases, the drawings don\u2019t exist anymore [to guide upgrades],\u201d Richard said in a Zoom conference sponsored by the Defense Writers Group.</p>\n\n<p>Where the drawings do exist, \u201cthey\u2019re like six generations behind the industry standard,\u201d he said, adding that there are also no technicians who fully understand them. \u201cThey\u2019re not alive anymore.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whether or not there even needs to be a land triad is another subject for debate entirely.

        "body": "Found this in r/CombatFootage and thought it was worthy of discussion, if anything, because it's one of the few times when we can see things from the Russian perspective. I edited out some passages that I didn't think were interesting for the sake of brevity.\n\nSource: https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1818251101335916683\n\n>It's clear why there's a slowdown. There are no people. The level of losses is high.\n\n>For those who don't understand, there is NO ONE PHYSICALLY to advance. The living force has been depleted. All this taking into account the fact that some military leaders are trying to adjust the result to fit the required dates. Everyone understands that by the end of the year there is a possibility that an agreement will begin, they are trying to make it in time.\n\n>The level of a number of tactical commanders is extremely low. During an operation, these \"father commanders\" do not prepare an evacuation group. Company \"Storm\" Logic: \"Why? The lightly wounded will come out on their own, but we don't pull out the heavy ones.\" The reality is that company commanders DO NOT KNOW their personnel, which is rapidly changing due to huge losses. Evil tongues say that in one of the static areas the management made a \"brilliant\" decision....not to take away the \"two hundredths\" [dead], because this increases the loss statistics. In the meantime, they lie \"ownerless\", listed as alive or missing. They are allowed to pull the dead out in parts, in doses, so that the statistics do not increase. Unfortunately, not fiction, but reality.\n\nIn the same subreddit, there's quite a few videos of CASEVAC operations being targeted by drones so this does not surprise me.\n\n>It's really very difficult - the enemy has dominance in UAVs. We must pay tribute - the enemy implements and adapts many engineering things along the lines of UAVs. With the advent of electronic warfare, they quickly change the frequency, etc. The whole world works for them. Their UAV tool line is very wide.\n\nThere have been frontline reports from Ukraine complaining about the same thing so it probably depends on the sector whether one side or the other obtains local drone superiority. At the same time, I don't know where this guy is reporting from (if anywhere), or is just repeating what he's been told by other soldiers.\n\n>A special forces group is launching a raid on an enemy stronghold. Out of 24 people, only 1 reached the enemy position! 2 - \"200\", the rest - \"300\"! All from fpv. Ours also work, but the ratio is not the same. We have thousands, they have millions.\n\nDoesn't specify how raids are conducted so I think it refers to the general strategy. My opinion was that attacks conducted by Russia are suicidal no matter what they're using, which is why I have been on the fence about the whole bike assaults situation.\n\n>Using fpv they are trying to shoot down aircraft and helicopters. The enemy's FPV drones are already operating 18-20 km from the front line and (edit: not) only in new constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but also in mainland ones. In the borderlands there is even a hunt for single civilian cars. Not just a UAV, but an fpv. Starlink - communications, control, repeaters. So far, we are behind. We are trying hard, but we are falling behind. Or did someone think that they removed Shoigu, fixed the \"militant\" Ivanov, and everything suddenly became good?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Found this in <a href=\"/r/CombatFootage\">r/CombatFootage</a> and thought it was worthy of discussion, if anything, because it&#39;s one of the few times when we can see things from the Russian perspective. I edited out some passages that I didn&#39;t think were interesting for the sake of brevity.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1818251101335916683\">https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1818251101335916683</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s clear why there&#39;s a slowdown. There are no people. The level of losses is high.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don&#39;t understand, there is NO ONE PHYSICALLY to advance. The living force has been depleted. All this taking into account the fact that some military leaders are trying to adjust the result to fit the required dates. Everyone understands that by the end of the year there is a possibility that an agreement will begin, they are trying to make it in time.</p>\n\n<p>The level of a number of tactical commanders is extremely low. During an operation, these &quot;father commanders&quot; do not prepare an evacuation group. Company &quot;Storm&quot; Logic: &quot;Why? The lightly wounded will come out on their own, but we don&#39;t pull out the heavy ones.&quot; The reality is that company commanders DO NOT KNOW their personnel, which is rapidly changing due to huge losses. Evil tongues say that in one of the static areas the management made a &quot;brilliant&quot; decision....not to take away the &quot;two hundredths&quot; [dead], because this increases the loss statistics. In the meantime, they lie &quot;ownerless&quot;, listed as alive or missing. They are allowed to pull the dead out in parts, in doses, so that the statistics do not increase. Unfortunately, not fiction, but reality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the same subreddit, there&#39;s quite a few videos of CASEVAC operations being targeted by drones so this does not surprise me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s really very difficult - the enemy has dominance in UAVs. We must pay tribute - the enemy implements and adapts many engineering things along the lines of UAVs. With the advent of electronic warfare, they quickly change the frequency, etc. The whole world works for them. Their UAV tool line is very wide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There have been frontline reports from Ukraine complaining about the same thing so it probably depends on the sector whether one side or the other obtains local drone superiority. At the same time, I don&#39;t know where this guy is reporting from (if anywhere), or is just repeating what he&#39;s been told by other soldiers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A special forces group is launching a raid on an enemy stronghold. Out of 24 people, only 1 reached the enemy position! 2 - &quot;200&quot;, the rest - &quot;300&quot;! All from fpv. Ours also work, but the ratio is not the same. We have thousands, they have millions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Doesn&#39;t specify how raids are conducted so I think it refers to the general strategy. My opinion was that attacks conducted by Russia are suicidal no matter what they&#39;re using, which is why I have been on the fence about the whole bike assaults situation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using fpv they are trying to shoot down aircraft and helicopters. The enemy&#39;s FPV drones are already operating 18-20 km from the front line and (edit: not) only in new constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but also in mainland ones. In the borderlands there is even a hunt for single civilian cars. Not just a UAV, but an fpv. Starlink - communications, control, repeaters. So far, we are behind. We are trying hard, but we are falling behind. Or did someone think that they removed Shoigu, fixed the &quot;militant&quot; Ivanov, and everything suddenly became good?

It would take years to simply capture the claimed territory of the Donbas.\n\nThey are nowhere close to the total surrender of Ukraine. Maybe if they confidently believe a breakthrough is possible after American aid gets cut off, they would keep pushing for a total subjugation.\n\nBut realistically, even after US aid gets cut off, it would very likely still be a bloody and gradual advance just like the last 7 months. Even if they 5x their rate of advance it would still be slow.\n\nMaybe it's worth it to continue sacrificing for the total surrender of Ukraine. Maybe it's not, depending on the specific financial and political position Russia finds itself at the moment Ukraine offers a peace deal. It also depends on the terms of the peace deal. How much Ukraine would be willing to give up.\n\nYou don't know, and I don't know.",
