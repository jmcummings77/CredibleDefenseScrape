As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

If the Leopard 1A5 ends up in a tank/tank engagement (as is the case with most tanks anyway) the victor is likely to be who spots whom first and fires accurately first.   \n\n\nAnd this is a point where the Leopard is actually better than its age gives it credit for. It will have a slight edge in target acquisition, gun accuracy and sensors owing to its upgrades and modifications late in service life. Many of the Russian tanks rolling around Ukraine have a hodgepodge mix of upgrades, some will outclass the Leopard, many will not. Because of this relatively complicated mess of tanks and upgrades it's very difficult to definitively say how the Leopard will perform.  \n\n\nThis obviously all depends on exactly what model of T-62,64,72,80,90 they'll be going up against, but things get progressively less favourable the further up that list you go, especially once you start comparing to the more modernized T-72B3s/90s which not only have range and sensor advantages, but their protection is far superior.   \n\n\nThe Leopard 1 even matches up rather unfavourably against some of the T-62Ms that Russia have started to bring back into service (the ones upgraded and in service at the end of the cold war). But ultimately we're just comparing basic specifications of the tank here, it doesn't take into account crew quality, battlefield awareness, other factors that are important to maximizing the Leopards advantages and minimizing its weaknesses. In a closed environment matchup, I'd probably err on the side of the Soviet era and Russian upgraded vehicles, but this isn't a closed environment.  \n\n\nAlso worth noting that the model of Leopard 1 Ukraine is receiving probably has better/equivalent sensors and \\*technically\\* equivalent ammunition to many of the Russian vehicles barring the more recently upgraded T72B3 and T90s. The ammunition situation is a bit of a crapshoot, nobody really knows what they're receiving and more importantly in what quantities. The L7 had some good ammunition back in the day but sourcing that in sizeable enough quantities along with spare parts is likely to be a headache, it's very likely they'll have to make do with subpar (by modern standards) ammunition, which again isn't necessarily a break point for the vehicles effectiveness, just another hurdle.  \n\n\nIt's very likely these Leopards will be used in reserve and static units anyway, it helps free up Ukraine's more capable vehicles for an offensive, there's a good chance these Leopard 1s will never have to directly fight another tank so all of these points are rather moot.",

The frequency of inspections has increased to ensure safe and reliable operations, and that ships are in compliance with all applicable regulations, it added. \n\n>Singapore detained 28 vessels last year, with all but two of those happening from June, according to the data from Tokyo MOU. There was a lull in detentions during the pandemic but in the decade through 2019 the annual record was just seven.\n\n>Separately, China has also increased safety checks on older ships calling at its ports in recent weeks, particularly for those that are 15 years or older.",

Luckily, the Pablo, built in 1997, was nearly empty. </p>\n\n<p>Singapore, a frequent stopping point en route to north Asia, is one of the busiest oil ports in the world. Most of the crude coming from the Middle East and western Russia will transit through the Strait of Malacca.</p>\n\n<p>The city-state\u2019s Maritime &amp; Port Authority said it resumed physical vessel inspections in 2022 when Covid restrictions relaxed. The frequency of inspections has increased to ensure safe and reliable operations, and that ships are in compliance with all applicable regulations, it added. </p>\n\n<p>Singapore detained 28 vessels last year, with all but two of those happening from June, according to the data from Tokyo MOU. There was a lull in detentions during the pandemic but in the decade through 2019 the annual record was just seven.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, China has also increased safety checks on older ships calling at its ports in recent weeks, particularly for those that are 15 years or older.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Kosovo police should also withdraw, he said in a statement late Tuesday.\n\n>Serbia should call its troops to stand down after President Aleksandar Vucic put them on high alert last week, Blinken said. Vucic should also urge Serbs in Kosovo to \u201chalt challenges to KFOR and refrain from further violence,\u201d he added, in reference to the NATO peacekeeping force.\n\n>The statement underscored growing impatience in Washington, which has backed a European Union-brokered negotiation process to resolve a standoff that is blocking both Serbia and Kosovo from making progress toward EU membership.\n\n>That process was essentially hamstrung last week when, following an election that Serbs living in northern Kosovo boycotted and declared invalid, ethnic-Albanian mayors tried to access their offices under police escort. Protesters clashed with police, triggering the deployment of NATO-led peacekeeping troops, with 30 soldiers in the KFOR mission and dozens of Serbs hurt in fresh violence on Monday.\n\n>The US has decided to exclude Kosovo from the large military exercise Defender Europe 2023. The unusually sharp rebuke is a blow to Kosovo, which depends on the US for financial aid and security, as well as backing in its push for further international recognition of its independence. \n\n>That didn\u2019t sit well with Kosovo Prime Minister Kurti, who described Blinken\u2019s rebuke as \u201cunfair, wrong, hurtful and na\u00efve\u201d in a social media post on Wednesday.\n\n>The initial trigger for the protests was the municipal election held in April which local Serbs boycotted, with the encouragement of Serbian President Vucic. Kurti pressed ahead with the vote, despite warnings from the US and the EU that it would exacerbate tensions.\n\n>The standoff continued on Wednesday. Hundreds of protesters gathered in the morning hours in the Serb-majority towns of Leposaviq and Zvecan, waving Serbian flags. They repeated demands that the newly elected ethnic-Albanian mayors leave their offices and that Kosovo police be withdrawn, former Zvecan official Srdjan Milovic told the Pristina-based Koha news service. \n\n>Kurti rejected the demands, saying that as long as \u201cthis violent mob outside who is ready to attack\u201d remains, he will keep Kosovo police on site. He added that \u201cif Serb protesters would peacefully ask for a new election,\u201d he would listen.\n\n>\u201cWhat we can do within law and still be doing politics, is at some point early elections,\u201d he said at the GLOBSEC Security conference in Bratislava, Slovakia. \u201cBut we cannot say that these mayors are not mayors.\u201d\n\n>While the most substantive issue is Serbia\u2019s refusal to recognize the independence of Kosovo, which formalized its break from Belgrade in 2008, the enmity between the two communities dates back to the war in Kosovo a generation ago. \n\n>By putting his army on high alert and moving some units nearer to the border on Friday, Vucic\u2019s actions are fueling concerns about just how far the situation in northern Kosovo could deteriorate. Belgrade was forced by NATO to withdraw its forces from Kosovo in 1999.\n\n>The flareup comes at a critical moment for the western allies who have backed the Kosovo state since its creation. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, meanwhile, means western diplomats have limited bandwidth to focus on another flareup on the European continent.\n\n>\u201cI call on all sides to step away from confrontation, and to take measures to restore calm,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Bratislava.\n\n>Russia and China have both backed Serbia\u2019s position, adding a geopolitical dimension to the dispute, and helping perpetuate the divisions that haunt the countries of the former Yugoslavia. \n\n>\u201cChina and Serbia are iron-clad friends,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday.

            "body": "The US leaks estimated (low confidence!) 145k \u201cpersonnel\u201d in Ukraine, 5k just across the border, and 22k PMC Wagner for a total of 172k men. \n\nThe leaks don\u2019t offer a lot of good clues about what \u201cpersonnel\u201d represents. It definitely includes almost all regular/reserve combat formations and most irregulars. It might exclude some air defense and artillery units. It might also leave out supply troops, ground crews and service troops, and civilian contractors and MoD employees. \n\nI would wager that it refers to \u201ccombat strength\u201d, with actual strength maybe twice that size. \n\nRussia began the war with some 200k men, reportedly mobilized 200-300k more, and probably received an additional 50-100k from volunteers/BARS, DPR/LPR conscripts, and \u201cunofficial\u201d mobilization. So 450-600k total men. \n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, the 200k conscripts for Spring 2023 will not be deployed without signing contracts. \n\nThe US leaks estimated 35-43k KIA by the end of February and an additional 150-180k WIA. I think by now 50k KIA and 200k WIA are reasonable numbers. \n\nFor the WIA, lets assume a good 75% rate of return to service (perhaps too generous). That would give 150k wounded and recovered and 50k no longer fit for service. Some of that 150k will no longer be combat capable and relegated to support roles. \n\nThese numbers are complicated by the variations in Russian terms of service. Some troops may be sent back to the fight even with nasty wounds (DPR/LPR conscripts, mobiks, convicts, etc) while others may be combat capable but their contracts end once they\u2019re wounded. \n\nYou also have both desertion and \u201chidden\u201d desertion from non-renewal of contracts which expired in \u201822, before mobilization extended them indefinitely. I haven\u2019t seen any good numbers for this, but with high refusal to deploy and non-renewal rates reported in many units it likely stands in the 10s of thousands. There are also issues with units and branches \u201cbuying\u201d soldiers and shifting them around illegally. This can leave men trapped in a \u201cgrey zone\u201d where they\u2019re deployed but not actually doing anything or part of an organized outfit. \n\nFinally, you have losses from illness, accidents, and so on. Some number of wounded, in the 10s of thousands, will also be convalescing right now. \n\nIn total, I think another 50-100k permanent/long term losses from all causes is reasonable. \n\nThat gives 150-200k currently out of action. Subtracted from manpower mobilized, that gives a low estimate of 250k total troops and a high one of 450k. \n\nI think **150-200k troops in combat formations and 350k total** is a reasonable guess, but it\u2019s in the middle of a very big range! \n\nThe leaks also had estimates about how many units were combat-effective. Their guess was that Russia had committed 97% of its available battalions/equivalent formations to Ukraine, or 527. Of those, 474 were in Ukraine itself. As of March 1, 364 were combat-effective (94 regular, 29 reserve/territorial, and 241 auxiliary/irregular) and 110 were ineffective (72 regular, 11 reserve, and 27 irregular). \n\nAround 25% of combat formations, including over 40% of regular formations, were combat-ineffective by March 1. 2/3 of Russia combat-effective formations were irregular or auxiliary formations. Many parts of the front at that point were held, and still are held, by exhausted/irregular formations. \n\nRussia hasn\u2019t brought in a large amount of manpower since the end of last year, and it was wasteful with what it had. As a result, Russia\u2019s forces have continued to degrade in both quantity and quality. The continued deployment of fought-out formations from hot zone to hot zone - brigades from Vuhledar/Kreminna to Bakhmut\u2019s flanks most recently - underscores how bad things are. I don\u2019t think things have meaningfully improved since March, and they may have worsened!\n\nThe estimate for Ukraine was 45-85k personnel in 34 regular brigades. This is a pretty rough estimate and excludes the TDF/NG. Currently they have 34 \u201cold\u201d and 2 \u201cnew\u201d brigades at the front along with 6 \u201cold\u201d and 17 \u201cnew\u201d in reserve. At 2k men on average per old brigade and 4K per new that\u2019s ~150k men in regular formations. Another 100k at least from the NG, TDF, and so on, which puts **Ukrainian strength at ~250k in combat formations.**",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The US leaks estimated (low confidence!) 145k \u201cpersonnel\u201d in Ukraine, 5k just across the border, and 22k PMC Wagner for a total of 172k men. </p>\n\n<p>The leaks don\u2019t offer a lot of good clues about what \u201cpersonnel\u201d represents. It definitely includes almost all regular/reserve combat formations and most irregulars. It might exclude some air defense and artillery units. It might also leave out supply troops, ground crews and service troops, and civilian contractors and MoD employees. </p>\n\n<p>I would wager that it refers to \u201ccombat strength\u201d, with actual strength maybe twice that size. </p>\n\n<p>Russia began the war with some 200k men, reportedly mobilized 200-300k more, and probably received an additional 50-100k from volunteers/BARS, DPR/LPR conscripts, and \u201cunofficial\u201d mobilization. So 450-600k total men. </p>\n\n<p>As far as I\u2019m aware, the 200k conscripts for Spring 2023 will not be deployed without signing contracts. </p>\n\n<p>The US leaks estimated 35-43k KIA by the end of February and an additional 150-180k WIA. I think by now 50k KIA and 200k WIA are reasonable numbers. </p>\n\n<p>For the WIA, lets assume a good 75% rate of return to service (perhaps too generous). That would give 150k wounded and recovered and 50k no longer fit for service. Some of that 150k will no longer be combat capable and relegated to support roles. </p>\n\n<p>These numbers are complicated by the variations in Russian terms of service. Some troops may be sent back to the fight even with nasty wounds (DPR/LPR conscripts, mobiks, convicts, etc) while others may be combat capable but their contracts end once they\u2019re wounded. </p>\n\n<p>You also have both desertion and \u201chidden\u201d desertion from non-renewal of contracts which expired in \u201822, before mobilization extended them indefinitely. I haven\u2019t seen any good numbers for this, but with high refusal to deploy and non-renewal rates reported in many units it likely stands in the 10s of thousands. There are also issues with units and branches \u201cbuying\u201d soldiers and shifting them around illegally. This can leave men trapped in a \u201cgrey zone\u201d where they\u2019re deployed but not actually doing anything or part of an organized outfit. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, you have losses from illness, accidents, and so on. Some number of wounded, in the 10s of thousands, will also be convalescing right now. </p>\n\n<p>In total, I think another 50-100k permanent/long term losses from all causes is reasonable. </p>\n\n<p>That gives 150-200k currently out of action. Subtracted from manpower mobilized, that gives a low estimate of 250k total troops and a high one of 450k. </p>\n\n<p>I think <strong>150-200k troops in combat formations and 350k total</strong> is a reasonable guess, but it\u2019s in the middle of a very big range! </p>\n\n<p>The leaks also had estimates about how many units were combat-effective. Their guess was that Russia had committed 97% of its available battalions/equivalent formations to Ukraine, or 527. Of those, 474 were in Ukraine itself. As of March 1, 364 were combat-effective (94 regular, 29 reserve/territorial, and 241 auxiliary/irregular) and 110 were ineffective (72 regular, 11 reserve, and 27 irregular). </p>\n\n<p>Around 25% of combat formations, including over 40% of regular formations, were combat-ineffective by March 1. 2/3 of Russia combat-effective formations were irregular or auxiliary formations. Many parts of the front at that point were held, and still are held, by exhausted/irregular formations. </p>\n\n<p>Russia hasn\u2019t brought in a large amount of manpower since the end of last year, and it was wasteful with what it had. As a result, Russia\u2019s forces have continued to degrade in both quantity and quality. The continued deployment of fought-out formations from hot zone to hot zone - brigades from Vuhledar/Kreminna to Bakhmut\u2019s flanks most recently - underscores how bad things are. I don\u2019t think things have meaningfully improved since March, and they may have worsened!</p>\n\n<p>The estimate for Ukraine was 45-85k personnel in 34 regular brigades. This is a pretty rough estimate and excludes the TDF/NG. Currently they have 34 \u201cold\u201d and 2 \u201cnew\u201d brigades at the front along with 6 \u201cold\u201d and 17 \u201cnew\u201d in reserve. At 2k men on average per old brigade and 4K per new that\u2019s ~150k men in regular formations. Another 100k at least from the NG, TDF, and so on, which puts <strong>Ukrainian strength at ~250k in combat formations.</strong></p>\n</div>",

The two countries have had no formal diplomatic relations since Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 \u2013 but Russians living and working here enjoy lax visa requirements, making it an easy choice for those who fled last year.\n\n>On the streets of Tbilisi, the reception for Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s has also been mixed. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole range of attitudes,\u201d said Ivan, a 20-something IT consultant from a city in Russia\u2019s far east. CNN is withholding Ivan\u2019s real name, to protect him from retribution should he ever return to Russia.\n\n>Some Georgians are \u201cwarm and welcoming\u201d and treat Russians as their \u201cbrothers,\u201d Ivan told CNN. Others tell them to \u201cget out.\u201d The key difference is age, he has found. \u201cThose who are welcoming are mostly people who were born in the USSR.

But such incidents can take their toll. \u201cI do feel a sort of frustration.\u201d\n\n>George Mchedlishvili, an associate professor of foreign policy at Tbilisi\u2019s European University, explained the skittishness of some Georgians. \u201cFor some, the Russian language is a trigger for them. It\u2019s the language Russian soldiers spoke.\u201d\n\n>Recent Russian aggression remains fresh in the memory here. Russia invaded the separatist regions of Abkhazia in 1992, and South Ossetia in 2008, when it fought a five-day war with Georgia. To this day, Russia occupies 20% of Georgia\u2019s internationally recognized territory. Georgians have seen Russians pour into their country many times in the past \u2013 not always, as last year, with suitcases and pets, but with guns and tanks.\n\n>Ivan arrived in Georgia with a suitcase \u2013 but he could have found himself arriving in Ukraine with a gun. Having served in the Russian army some years ago, he became a \u201cvaluable asset,\u201d he says, after President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization in September.\n\n>The next day, officers visited his registered address \u2013 his mother\u2019s house in his hometown. \u201cInitially she didn\u2019t want to open the door, but they were persistent. They just kept coming every hour,\u201d he said. Ivan had moved to St. Petersburg for work long before, but when he heard the news of these visits, he knew he had to leave Russia. He took a train south the following day and then a taxi to the Georgian border.\n\n>\u201cI was lucky to pass the border,\u201d Ivan said. He had been arrested in March last year for protesting against Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and spent several days in prison before being released, he said. Although he did not face criminal charges, he feared his details might have been stored and that he would be blocked from leaving the country. But he crossed the frontier without any trouble.\n\n>>\u2018Guilty until proven innocent\u2019\n\n>Despite having made himself an \u201cenemy\u201d of his own state, Ivan says he still feels like the \u201cenemy\u201d in Tbilisi. Some Georgians have been more forgiving towards Russians who fled their country immediately after the war began. They are seen as being genuinely opposed to the conflict, while those who fled conscription are seen as only opposed to fighting in it.\n\n>Unaware of his previous imprisonment, some Georgians see Ivan as one of the less politically aware Russians, he said. The trick, he says, is to prove your \u201cinnocence\u201d as quickly as possible, by showing you are opposed to the actions of the Russian government \u2013 perhaps by wearing a Ukrainian flag.\n\n>But some encounter more exacting standards. \u201cThere are some bars that make you sign when you enter,\u201d said Daria Polkina, 27, a freelance graphic designer from Moscow. \u201cIf they suspect that you\u2019re Russian, they make you sign a paper that says \u2018I am against Putin and whatever he is doing.\u2019\u201d Russians who do not sign are refused entry, she said.\n\n>Polkina has signed before but said such prerequisites hardly make for an amicable evening, adding there have been \u201cbad encounters.\u201d \u201cMostly, when I meet Georgians, when they ask me where I\u2019m from, I say I\u2019m from Russia \u2013 and then follow up with \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me feel ashamed, guilty.\u201d\n\n>Even bars in the Georgian capital without these restrictions make their feelings known. Many bear signs ranging from the direct (\u201cF*** Putin\u201d) to the historical (\u201cRussia is an occupier\u201d) to those setting out the terms of engagement (\u201cWe don\u2019t speak Russian\u201d).

            "body": ">Salom\u00e9 Dzvelaia, 31, a local translator, said that while Russians have been content to stay in their \u201ccomfort zones\u201d in Tbilisi, life for locals has grown increasingly uncomfortable. The average Russian is more than twice as wealthy as the average Georgian; the influx of migrant and foreign exchange flows into Georgia have been so great that a recent IMF report found that Georgia\u2019s economy grew by 10% in 2022. But the boom has caused unrest: Rent spiked by 75% in Tbilisi last year, pricing many locals out of the center.\n\n>\u201cGeorgian people \u2013 they can\u2019t afford $800 a month,\u201d Dzvelaia said. When she decided to rent out her apartment last year, \u201cI got so many calls in two minutes. About 20 calls from Russian people. They said, \u2018We\u2019ll pay double. Please, we need this apartment.\u2019\u201d But she refused these offers, instead renting at the original price to a Georgian woman who had recently been evicted from her apartment, after a Russian family offered to pay way over the market rate.\n\n>Dzvelaia said it upsets her to see Russians having a \u201cgood life\u201d in Georgia. She acknowledged that her words may sound xenophobic but explained that her resentment stems from Russia\u2019s expansionist actions that have shaped her life since before she was born. While some Russians attempt to live free from politics in Georgia, Dzvelaia says she \u201ccan\u2019t escape from politics.\u201d\n\n>Dzvelaia\u2019s family are from the now-occupied region of Abkhazia. When Russia launched its invasion in 1992, they first came for people of stature, in an attempt to terrorize the rest of the population, she said. When her grandmother, a famous writer, went to buy bread one morning, her grandfather, who owned a factory, got a knock at the door. \u201cAre you Khuta Jgamadze?\u201d a group of Russian troops asked him. When he confirmed he was, he was shot eight times. Dzvelaia\u2019s family buried him in the garden.\n\n>According to Georgian Orthodox tradition, Dzvelaia\u2019s grandmother pledged to remain close to the grave for a 40-day mourning period. But the invading Russian forces advanced closer in this period and thousands of people began to evacuate. Dzvelaia\u2019s mother, who was heavily pregnant with her at the time, decided she could not wait any longer. She fled with her husband before the 40 days were up, while the grandmother stayed.\n\n>\u201cThey killed her on September 27 \u2013 the day I was born,\u201d said Dzvelaia.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Salom\u00e9 Dzvelaia, 31, a local translator, said that while Russians have been content to stay in their \u201ccomfort zones\u201d in Tbilisi, life for locals has grown increasingly uncomfortable. The average Russian is more than twice as wealthy as the average Georgian; the influx of migrant and foreign exchange flows into Georgia have been so great that a recent IMF report found that Georgia\u2019s economy grew by 10% in 2022. But the boom has caused unrest: Rent spiked by 75% in Tbilisi last year, pricing many locals out of the center.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGeorgian people \u2013 they can\u2019t afford $800 a month,\u201d Dzvelaia said. When she decided to rent out her apartment last year, \u201cI got so many calls in two minutes. About 20 calls from Russian people. They said, \u2018We\u2019ll pay double. Please, we need this apartment.\u2019\u201d But she refused these offers, instead renting at the original price to a Georgian woman who had recently been evicted from her apartment, after a Russian family offered to pay way over the market rate.</p>\n\n<p>Dzvelaia said it upsets her to see Russians having a \u201cgood life\u201d in Georgia. She acknowledged that her words may sound xenophobic but explained that her resentment stems from Russia\u2019s expansionist actions that have shaped her life since before she was born. While some Russians attempt to live free from politics in Georgia, Dzvelaia says she \u201ccan\u2019t escape from politics.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dzvelaia\u2019s family are from the now-occupied region of Abkhazia. When Russia launched its invasion in 1992, they first came for people of stature, in an attempt to terrorize the rest of the population, she said. When her grandmother, a famous writer, went to buy bread one morning, her grandfather, who owned a factory, got a knock at the door. \u201cAre you Khuta Jgamadze?\u201d a group of Russian troops asked him. When he confirmed he was, he was shot eight times. Dzvelaia\u2019s family buried him in the garden.</p>\n\n<p>According to Georgian Orthodox tradition, Dzvelaia\u2019s grandmother pledged to remain close to the grave for a 40-day mourning period. But the invading Russian forces advanced closer in this period and thousands of people began to evacuate. Dzvelaia\u2019s mother, who was heavily pregnant with her at the time, decided she could not wait any longer. She fled with her husband before the 40 days were up, while the grandmother stayed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey killed her on September 27 \u2013 the day I was born,\u201d said Dzvelaia. Her mother gave birth to her in the woods lining the paths through Georgia\u2019s mountainous Svaneti region, lodged high up in the Caucasus. Her family were among the 250,000 Georgians displaced by the invasion, in what the United Nations has recognized as a campaign of ethnic cleansing.

This turned out a lot longer than I expected so, uh, please note that I haven't re-checked it after writing it, some of it may be quite wrong.\n\nIt's hard to say because history is always an imperfect guide when it comes to things that may happen in the future. However, we can look at some relevant precedents and venture some guesses.\n\nBefore I begin, two caveats. First, the initial version of this post featured both similarities and differences between the conflicts I mentioned below and the war in Ukraine. I yanked that part out because there are *a lot* more differences than similarities, and the post got too long, but it's important to note that this is very much the reason why I'm saying that history is an imperfect guide. While we can draw some *general* conclusions from these precedents, it's extremely unlikely that any of them apply particularly well.\n\nSecond, please note that I'm using the term \"war in Ukraine\" somewhat loosely, to refer to the conflict that started in 2014 and is currently ongoing. I am quite convinced that fifty years from now, historians will, at best, insist that \"the war in Donbas\" and whatever they'll call the war that started in 2022 is an imperfect terminology that they've inherited from contemporaries (i.e. us). But IMHO it's the same conflict. It's not another war, it's the same one that Putin's government started back in 2014.\n\nOkay, so what are some relevant precedents:\n\nThe Paris Peace Accords, which put an end to the US military intervention in Vietnam, may be a relevant precedent because it involved a major military power that gradually became engulfed in a conflict of expanding scope, whose government had to hide the extent of its involvement early on, but eventually not only became unable to hide the extent of its involvement but had to resort to extensive and, after a while, increasingly unpopular drafting.\n\nThe negotiations that led to the Peace Accords took five years. By 1973, negotiations were definitely public knowledge. The fact that they would happen was, itself, made public early on: Lyndon Johnson publicly called for negotiations early on, and shortly after he announced that he would not seek a second term, Ho Chi Minh's government also publicly accepted the offer for negotiations. \n\nHowever, the actual *content* of the negotiations was a mixture of public and secret, more secret than public early on. There was a lot of \"backroom dealing\", on all sides, and even in the peace delegations, authority was not always obvious. Early negotiations only became reasonably productive after W. Averell Harriman and Cyrus Vance could meet privately with L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd, a politburo member who did not have any significant formal standing in the delegation, as Xu\u00e2n Thu\u1ef7, who was nominally the head of the Vietnamese delegation, had very little political authority after his fallout with party leadership years before that. Backroom dealing extended beyond the immediate peace delegations. The South Vietnamese government, for instance, reached out to Nixon early on, through entirely informal channels (Anna Chennault, the widow of Flying Tiger leader Claire Chennault, and Bui Diem -- technically a formal channel, since he was the ambassador of South Vietnamese, but Nixon was still only a presidential *candidate* at the time, so this was in a somewhat grey zone). The American delegation also had to hold consultations with the Soviet government; Harriman, in fact, had met with Kosygin to discuss the war in Vietnam as early as 1965.\n\nBy the middle of Nixon's first term or so, it was also generally expected that peace would be coming soon. Peace in Vietnam was a major theme of Nixon's campaign for the 1972 elections. The real \"point of no return\", after which most people were probably certain peace would happen sooner than later, was in May 1972, when Nixon announced that the US would be satisfied with a cease-fire as a condition of withdrawing its troops, having demanded a withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops up to that point. International conditions and domestic struggles in the US also made it obvious that the war could not last for much longer.\n\nHowever, even at this point, nobody knew *when* it was going to happen. It would be months before the other significant hurdle was overcome. In the fall of 1972, North Vietnamese authorities also accepted (at least on paper) to negotiate a final settlement with a South Vietnamese government that could remain in Saigon. *This* part of the negotiations was not public.\n\nSo even though it was public knowledge that negotiations were happening, and many major points of negotiations were publicly announced, even late-stage discussion were secret, and the breakthrough definitely appeared to be very sudden. Operation Linebacker II was in full force in December 1972, in what would later be known was more a show of force aimed at the South Vietnamese government. But then bombings north of the 20th parallel were stopped on December 30, after the North Vietnamese government agreed to resume talks, and a treaty was announced just three weeks later.\n\nThe Soviet-Afghan war is also a relevant, if one-sided precedent. It was also a conflict in which a major military power (the Soviet Union) became entrapped in a war that proved longer than expected. It was also a conflict in which the Soviet Union became engulfed over fears that the Moscow-backed regime would fail to keep Afghanistan firmly in the Union's orbit after years of struggle over influence (although more violent, and along completely different lines and in a very different cultural context compared to the similar struggle over Ukraine). And, of course, it was also a conflict in which one party (Afghanistan) received Western military backing, although it was obviously applied by very different structures, operating in a very different political context -- Ukraine has a real, organised, civilian-controlled army, operating under a democratic regime, it's not an insurgent militia, and there's no real equivalent to the Karmal regime. It's difficult to draw too many relevant conclusions because it was ended under very different circumstances: we now call it the Afghan-Soviet war but the Soviet Union was formally *asked for assistance* by the Afghan government, found themselves at odds with the regime they'd backed, then installed their own puppet regime with whom it remained on formally good terms until the end, so there was never a peace treaty to sign per se. However, it's a useful precedent in that the Soviet Union started by backing a political current and ended up sending the tanks, also had a lot of face to save, and also had pro-Soviet regimes to worry about.\n\nPeace efforts basically started about six years before the formal withdrawal of Soviet troops. They were particularly tortuous because they also involved border disputes with Pakistan -- in fact, the early peace efforts were very much led by Pakistani authorities. The foreign visits that led to the development of the Afghani peace framework were public IIRC -- the Pakistani foreign minister met with Chinese, Soviet, American, French, British and various Arab representatives to discuss the development of a peace accord over Afghanistan.\n\n(Part 1/2)",

                "body": "However, owing to the Soviet government's secrecy, this was a far less public affair. Gorbachev managed to convince the Politburo that their troops would have to withdraw from Afghanistan as early as 1985, but the decision was only announced in 1987, and it was finally carried out in 1989. Up to the 1987 announcement, it was hardly public knowledge.\n\nThe Iran-Iraq war carries some interesting precedents, in that a segment of one country's population was, or at least had reasons to be sympathetic to the other country's government. Iraq's Shia population shared religious and cultural ties with the Shia-dominated Iran. The parallel obviously stops here -- Iraq's Shia-majoritary population was very much marginalized by the Ba'ath government, it was Iraq that invaded Iran, and Iran didn't manage to rouse sectarian conflict in Iraq -- most of the Shi'ite population that remained in Iraq was largely loyal to Saddam's government, but many had left Iraq, while Shi'ite leaders were under constant surveillance and subject to permanent harrassment.\n\nAFAIK the resolution of the war was virtually entirely foreign-brokered. It was not at all obvious that peace was going to happen; the war is generally described as having ended after both parties accepted UN Resolution 598 (which called for the immediate implementation of a nearly two year-old resolution!). The resolution was voted nearly a year before the war actually ended. News that Iran would accept it was surprising, but it did not result in an immediate ceasefire, so for a while it wasn't even clear there *was* going to be a peace. It's not so much that no one saw it coming -- both parties were exhausted and it was clear that the stalemate would not be broken soon -- but the sentiment that \"this was it\" was by no means universal.\n\nWhat can we gather from all this?\n\n> How does this usually work?\n\nUsually, one part signals to the other that it's willing to talk peace. This often involves a public first step which kicks off behind-the-scenes negotiations; it's pretty rare that the signal and initial negotiations are entirely secret at first, both because the consequences of a leak are unpleasant and because someone has to show signs of good faith first. It does happen though -- I don't know of an all-out war that ended like that in recent history (but I'm also largely unfamiliar with the modern history of Africa and most of Asia so I'm largely unfamiliar with most modern wars), but e.g. there are treaties that originated in entirely secret talks. E.g. the talks that led up to the Oslo Agreements were completely secret at first.\n\n(Edit: However, the exact formula in which this happens, and the degree to which it's public knowledge varies. Soviet authorities took a long time to announce their intent to withdraw from Afghanistan, in part because they feared internal repercussions, especially the degree to which it would strain already tense relations between various political factions, between political and military leadership, and between political leadership and industrial and local administration.)\n\n> Are the negotiations essentielly public knowlede and its telegraphed that peace is coming, or is it usually a sudden thing?\n\nThe fact that formal negotiations are happening is generally public knowledge. Exact details, however, are usually not known. Major talking points are public -- e.g. the general position of the US and North Vietnamese delegation was known throughout the five years of talks that preceded the Paris Accords -- but everyday evolutions are usually not released until much later, since delegates usually don't have infinite authority to promise anything they desire. Also, informal negotiations, or through outright informal backchannels, routinely happen even *while* negotiations through formal channels are carried out.\n\nCommunication through various backchannels usually happens throughout a conflict AFAIK. It's uncommon that all communication ceases completely, at all levels, in any setting -- but whatever communication keeps on happening isn't exactly a form of state-sanctioned negotiations most of the time, so while it's usually secret, it's also not quite the same as public knowledge that peace talks are happening.\n\nIt's rarely a sudden thing in that, while it's somewhat uncommon for negotiations to start, but then cease completely for a long time, it *is* quite common for them to last for years. Consequently, when negotiations start, it's usually clear for everyone that a peace is coming, so it doesn't come as a surprise when it happens. However, it can take a long time for it to happen, and breakthroughs often seem to come out of the blue. E.g. the Kumanovo agreement, which ended the Kosovo war, happened less than a week after the Yugoslavian parliament agreed to the terms of the international peace plan, and it all seemed to come out of the blue. However, talks had been ongoing since the end of March, and Finnish and Russian negotiators had tried to persuade Milosevic to withdraw troops from Kosovo throughout April and May. IIRC it was known that Finland and Russia were trying to mediate, but the extent of the negotiations wasn't known.\n\n(2/2)",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>However, owing to the Soviet government&#39;s secrecy, this was a far less public affair. Gorbachev managed to convince the Politburo that their troops would have to withdraw from Afghanistan as early as 1985, but the decision was only announced in 1987, and it was finally carried out in 1989. Up to the 1987 announcement, it was hardly public knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The Iran-Iraq war carries some interesting precedents, in that a segment of one country&#39;s population was, or at least had reasons to be sympathetic to the other country&#39;s government. Iraq&#39;s Shia population shared religious and cultural ties with the Shia-dominated Iran. The parallel obviously stops here -- Iraq&#39;s Shia-majoritary population was very much marginalized by the Ba&#39;ath government, it was Iraq that invaded Iran, and Iran didn&#39;t manage to rouse sectarian conflict in Iraq -- most of the Shi&#39;ite population that remained in Iraq was largely loyal to Saddam&#39;s government, but many had left Iraq, while Shi&#39;ite leaders were under constant surveillance and subject to permanent harrassment.</p>\n\n<p>AFAIK the resolution of the war was virtually entirely foreign-brokered. It was not at all obvious that peace was going to happen; the war is generally described as having ended after both parties accepted UN Resolution 598 (which called for the immediate implementation of a nearly two year-old resolution!). The resolution was voted nearly a year before the war actually ended. News that Iran would accept it was surprising, but it did not result in an immediate ceasefire, so for a while it wasn&#39;t even clear there <em>was</em> going to be a peace. It&#39;s not so much that no one saw it coming -- both parties were exhausted and it was clear that the stalemate would not be broken soon -- but the sentiment that &quot;this was it&quot; was by no means universal.</p>\n\n<p>What can we gather from all this?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does this usually work?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Usually, one part signals to the other that it&#39;s willing to talk peace.

The two eyepieces to the right belong to the EMES-15 main scope. Nearby are the mechanical selector levers for day and thermal vision and the magnification changer. The central control panel of the fire control system is located in the middle below the two eyepieces. The large switch with the arrow operates the weapon stabilization according to the operating levels from hydraulic aiming without stabilization to full stabilization.

Contrast and polarity (representation of the heat sources white or the heat sources dark) as well as the size of the field of view can be set. In addition, parameters of the stabilization accuracy can be adjusted. A field adjustment system allows the adjustment of the line of sight with the extended bore axis of the cannon to be checked and, if necessary, adjusted without having to leave the tank. In a control block (not visible) above the EMES-15, the individual ballistic data of the tank's cannon can be set from firing with combat and practice ammunition. In addition, the current ballistically significant data can be set on this control panel, such as air temperature, load temperature, Crosswind and the air pressure in the form of the topographical altitude value.",

They&#39;re claiming Ukraine tried to make a large assault into Russia with 6 tanks, engineering vehicles, artillery support, etc. There are no videos to back up the claim and only one low resolution photo that is impossible to glean any contextual information from.</p>\n\n<p>That telegram channel is unabashedly pro-Russian, they don&#39;t even pretend to be neutral. Are there any other sources corroborating this large of an assault at all? I haven&#39;t seen any, but I dont have much time to look, to be honest.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit: I do see there are some videos from about 12 hours ago that the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom Legion were in the area, but no proof that they have heavy equipment with them (looks like a light infantry force) or that they&#39;re being routed as thoroughly as that Russian telegram claims (if at all).  </p>\n\n<p>Similarly the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1664152041751445505\">governor is claiming</a> just the opposite &quot;there was and is no enemy in the territory&quot;.

Having known a few people who speak Russian or Ukrainian as a first language but can write and speak english fluently, some of the writing patterns seem bang on. Anyone actually fluent in Russia is more than welcome to read the English and Russian text to see if they concur.\n\n*Personal life*\n\nHe's a young engineer currently working for Sukhoi. Can't leave Russia currently because of family connections. Doesn't have enough knowledge/seniority to get picked up by the American alphabet agencies, and is also understandably afraid of Russian prison. A neurological condition complicates makes his daily life miserable, but he keeps going for his parents and his cat. Thankfully, it at least made him ineligible for military service.\n\n*Sukhoi*\n\nMost of his colleagues are retired Russian or even Soviet military personnel. They understand how badly the \"SVO is going\", and are pretty worried. The SU-75 is supposedly actually on-schedule, and will have a first flight in summer-autumn. However, in his opinion the aircraft will not see use within the current war. Also in his opinion, Russia's modern aircraft are actually pretty comparable to US counterparts and ascribes many of the issues to training, maintenance, corruption, strategy, tactics, etc. He also claims that the infamous wood screw SU-57 was just one of the 10 test bed T-50 airframes and a non-Russia commenter seems to corroborate. In his words, \"It's pretty much the same story as the YF-22 looking vastly different than the F-22A. There are no current plans for a naval aircraft variant since the production levels are already low and the Kuznetsov is... itself. He remarks that Sukhoi is seen as one of the best aerospace places to look at, and says that MiG is in pretty bad shape due to getting one of their larger Moscow properties sold to someone else. Apparently if he was to leave Sukhoi, he would owe \"10-15K grand\" (not sure if $ or Ru). Out of all the features of US warfighting, the one he and his colleagues respect the most is network-centric tactics.\n\n*Sanctions*\n\nThey're still able to get enough microchips, and have a decent supply. No apparent danger of Russian planes falling out of the sky. Economically, he doesn't really feel the sting. Aerospace has seen little brain drain since most of the people who work there are die-hard patriots. Since people are paid well, less corruption has crept into the working culture at the design bureau. He doesn't miss McDonalds that much--he says the food was too salty anyways.\n\n_______________________________________________\nThis AMA to be taken with a ***mountain*** of salt.

Such a high stated readiness was also reflected in an actual readiness to fight, which allowed the Russian authorities for a long time to replenish their army\u2019s ranks by recruiting volunteers and contract soldiers.\n\nIn September last year, after the announcement of the \u201cpartial mobilization,\u201d more than half of Russian men aged 18 to 59 (55%) expressed a readiness to fight \u2013 voluntarily or if called up. Until mid-April, when we last asked the corresponding question, the figure remained at about the same level, fluctuating between 53% and 58%.\n\nClearly, a stated readiness to fight is not a sufficient basis for assessing potential reserves. It largely reflects general loyalty toward the authorities, Putin and the SVO, shaped by many years of propaganda and the propaganda now in support of the war effort. Actual readiness to go and fight is more correlated with personal socio-economic circumstances. In addition, an important factor is the extent to which the war affected a person or his loved ones.\n\n...\n\nOverall, across Russia the share of people who expressed a readiness to voluntarily fight in the SVO was 15% (in the border regions, as mentioned above, it was 22%). If we assume that in other regions of the country, these people acted on that intention (with some even going to the enlistment office by their own free will) in approximately the same proportion as in the border regions, then in Russia about 400,000 (or 1%) men of military age \u2013 very close to the number mobilized last fall, according to the authorities \u2013 are more or less actually ready to go and fight.\n\n...\n\nThirty-seven percent of men are ready to go and fight if called up in Russia overall. Meanwhile, 31% said they are not ready. The \u201cmobilization readiness index\u201d we put forward shows the ratio of men who are ready to be mobilized versus those who are not. If the index is greater than one, then the number of men who can see themselves at the front is greater than the number of those who cannot.

Such a high stated readiness was also reflected in an actual readiness to fight, which allowed the Russian authorities for a long time to replenish their army\u2019s ranks by recruiting volunteers and contract soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>In September last year, after the announcement of the \u201cpartial mobilization,\u201d more than half of Russian men aged 18 to 59 (55%) expressed a readiness to fight \u2013 voluntarily or if called up. Until mid-April, when we last asked the corresponding question, the figure remained at about the same level, fluctuating between 53% and 58%.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, a stated readiness to fight is not a sufficient basis for assessing potential reserves. It largely reflects general loyalty toward the authorities, Putin and the SVO, shaped by many years of propaganda and the propaganda now in support of the war effort. Actual readiness to go and fight is more correlated with personal socio-economic circumstances. In addition, an important factor is the extent to which the war affected a person or his loved ones.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Overall, across Russia the share of people who expressed a readiness to voluntarily fight in the SVO was 15% (in the border regions, as mentioned above, it was 22%). If we assume that in other regions of the country, these people acted on that intention (with some even going to the enlistment office by their own free will) in approximately the same proportion as in the border regions, then in Russia about 400,000 (or 1%) men of military age \u2013 very close to the number mobilized last fall, according to the authorities \u2013 are more or less actually ready to go and fight.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Thirty-seven percent of men are ready to go and fight if called up in Russia overall. Meanwhile, 31% said they are not ready. The \u201cmobilization readiness index\u201d we put forward shows the ratio of men who are ready to be mobilized versus those who are not. If the index is greater than one, then the number of men who can see themselves at the front is greater than the number of those who cannot. An index reading of less than one shows that there are fewer people who are ready to fight than those who are not. <em>[Worth noting here that the index is misleading - the author ignores the 15% of the male population who are ready to volunteer and compares only the segments of the male population who are willing to fight if mobilised and those unwilling to fight if mobilised]</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, across Russia the index is 1.18, meaning for every six who are ready one way or another to go to war, there are five who are not.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Along with the high rates of support for the SVO and mobilization, there is a high degree of tolerance for mobilization dodgers.
