Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

[Some reporting](https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2024/08/29/ethiopia-alarmed-as-egypt-sends-special-forces-and-arms-to-somalia/) claims that some Egyptian special forces accompanied the shipment and there are [rumors](https://x.com/themariamwahba/status/1829173905858408918) that up to 10,000 troops are forthcoming. \n\nThe core of the current disagreement is Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia that sits between Ethiopia and the Gulf of Aden. Ethiopia, desperate for coastal access has signed a preliminary deal with Somaliland some of it's coastline in exchange for possibly recognizing it's independence. Mogadishu currently relies on 10,000 Ethiopian troops to combat al Shabaab and as a result has virtually zero leverage. Side note, I think this is where the 10,000 Egyptians number comes from. To combat this, Mogadishu has been cultivating it's relationship with Egypt to counterbalance Ethiopian power and leverage. \n\nEgypt and Ethiopia have been at odds since 2011 when Ethiopia began constructing the [Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ethiopian_Renaissance_Dam) on the Blue Nile, something that the Egyptians absolutely hate. In response Egypt has opposed Ethiopia pretty much anywhere they could but particularly relevant for this context is their opposition to the Ethiopian deal with Somaliland. \n\nUltimately the situation is unlikely to lead to war directly between Egypt and Ethiopia, the geography is very bad for Egypt and the Ethiopian military is relatively incapable in comparison. A deterioration of the local security situation is much more likely such as Ethiopian troops no longer cooperating against al Shabaab. Ultimately this likely very bad news for Somalia, they can barely govern some of themselves as is and if Ethiopia starts actively destabilizing the country things could implode. Potentially, bad news for Ethiopia if Egypt pumps a bunch of arms into Tigray and reignites that conflict. It could also be very bad news for Egypt and Sudan if Ethiopia starts really messing around with the Nile. The winners would be insurgent groups in the region such as al Shabaab and ISS.",

I would think the path of least resistance for the Russians would be to go towards Pokrovsk before reinforcements arrive, owing to the reportedly dire state of the AFU in that area.

Now tell me how Ukraine plans to execute that when they've struggled to adopt our way of executing warfare and have not demonstrated the combined arms organization required for sustained offensive combat operations against an entrenched foe.\n\nWe trained Afghans and Iraqis for decades to fight our way, and the Vietnamese before that, and look what happened. This was difficult even with the US next to them, let alone in a real shooting war. \n\nGiving them technology/equipment can slow the tide, but to achieve what you are saying?

You could argue about a nuclear response, but look at where the Russian elite kids. They are all in the West. Where is the son of top Russian propagandist Solovyov? He is in London.

I'd be willing to bet the\u00a0*former*\u00a0is much more common.\n\nBecause the former countries pumping up aid even more will actually be able to make a significant difference in the war. No matter how much the latter countries pump up their aid, it won't really be very much.\n\nThis isn't really a good metric, it just goes to show which countries are the more significant and crucial military supporters and which, frankly, are less.\n\n>Further, I would completely disagree with the idea that Ukraine does not recognize and appreciate the smaller nations giving larger %s of their total budget as aid.\n\nUkrainians on the frontline are not going to care which country donated a larger proportion of their GDP. They're going to care that they have a tonne of artillery shells, air defence missiles, drones and ATGMs and the countries/organisations that donate the most of these are the ones that these soldiers will care about.\n\nPercentages are an academic discussion.\n\n>If we measure total aid\u00a0*without*\u00a0accounting for GDP, the USA is number one by a mile. And we would both agree the US needs to do\u00a0*more*, so that's probably not the best metric for us to use.\n\nWhich is why we're counting Europe as a whole...\n\n>Would the rest of NATO not come to the aid of France, if they were invaded? What about Germany? Obviously they would, so similar logic should apply. If France or Germany doubted this fact, they likely wouldn't have given as much as a single rifle round to Ukraine.\n\nYeah, this logic breaks down completely even on a surface level reading. France and Germany are likely nowhere near as concerned about the willingness of NATO to come to their aid in the event they are invaded given that Germany and France don't even border Russia and are both far from the Russian mainland, meaning Russia has a tonne of bodies it needs to get through before it can even begin to reach even just Germany. Because they're less concerned, any wavering of NATO willingness will have a far less significant impact on them.\n\nFurthermore, the power dynamics are very different here as well. Germany and France are the few alliance members which will be the ones carrying out the bulk of the defensive contributions in NATO, not any of the Baltics. You're not really going to be too concerned about the willingness of the people you're more likely to need to protect to come to your aid if you need it instead.\n\nAdditionally, the only country that would want to invade Germany and France would find it a near complete impossibility to do so. Therefore there is no credible military threat to either country whereas there is to the Baltics.\n\n>Meanwhile, in Western Europe, the average citizen has no real fear of Russian aggression personally impacting them, thus you get pearl-clutching about the cost of aid to Ukraine.\n\nAnd yet it's Western Europe that will invariably be the ones coming to liberate Eastern Europe if Russia does attack.\n\nAgain, if the Baltics actually feared an imminent Russian attack with NATO support to back them up, they would not have sent as much as they did. Your argument trying to dismiss this is weak at best.\n\nIf I know my big strong friend is going to back me up no matter what, I'm allowed to be far more reckless than I otherwise would have been.",

        "body": "Israel is working on establishing domestic military small drone production to replace/complement the use of DJI Chinese drones:\n\n>The Ministry of Defense directorate of defense research and development (DDR&D) is preparing a tender worth hundreds of millions of shekels to be issued in the coming weeks for the procurement of 20,000 drones that are made in Israel, a source close to the matter has told \"Globes.\" The companies that win the tender will provide drones of various types including assault drones, and surveillance and intelligence drones, in several deliveries **over a period of five years**. Estimates are that a range of Israeli companies will bid in the tender including Dronix, Xtend, Robotican, Tehiru, Heven Drones and CopterPix.\n\n>The tender will mark a change in strategy by the IDF, which in recent months has preferred the Chinese drone industry over Israel's drone makers. As \"Globes\" has previously reported, the IDF has procured thousands of Chinese drones manufactured by DJI and Autel - two companies that have been blacklisted by the US Department of Defense.\n\n>Hezbollah has a system called Aeroscope for identifying Chinese drones and locating their operators. Thus, the IDF understands the need not to be dependent on foreign drones, and the importance of supporting the long-term ability of Israeli industry to provide the strategic advantage of domestic production of the drones, which are changing the face of the battlefield, as is happening in Ukraine, for example.\n\n>Not all drones that are currently in the possession of Israeli companies can meet the requirements of the army, due to low price requirements and the high costs of raw materials and components. As far as is known, the price that the IDF will demand is still subject to change, but it is in the range of **NIS 10,000-20,000 per drone** ($2750-$5600), with the lower threshold being too low from many companies' point of view. While Chinese companies like DJI and Autel provide the army with a finished and cheap product, Israeli companies will be required to assemble the drones with the components that will be sought in the military tender, with the cost of some of these components, like a thermal sensor, amounting to thousands of dollars per unit.\n\n>One of the Israeli companies expected to bid for the IDF drone tender is\u00a0Xtend, based in Ramat Hahayal in Tel Aviv, which already provides to the IDF as well as civilian installations like offshore gas rigs. The company produces drones that are relatively cheap like the Wolverine, a multi-mission UAS on which the IDF can install thermal cameras, weapons, loudspeakers or arms for opening doors. Another Israeli company that culd bid for the tender is\u00a0Robotican, which produces the Goshawk - a flying drone that can become a miniature motorized vehicle capable of performing a range of intelligence and assault missions.\n\n>Other companies likely to bid for the IDF tender include:\u00a0Tehiru, which specializes in drones with encrypted communications that evade the enemy's electronics combat system could offer its White Widow drone;\u00a0Dronix, which manufactures the DR multi-mission series drones - the simplest of which is the DR-750, which can provide aerial surveillance for up to 35 minutes;\u00a0Heven Drones\u00a0provides the Urban drone which can remain in the air for 37 minutes and can carry up to 10 kilograms;\u00a0CopterPIX\u00a0provides a series of drones under the ERE brand.\n\nhttps://en.globes.co.il/en/article-idf-to-procure-20000-israeli-made-drones-1001487932\n\nThe IDF is heavily utilizing small drones in Gaza for virtually any function imaginable.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Israel is working on establishing domestic military small drone production to replace/complement the use of DJI Chinese drones:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Ministry of Defense directorate of defense research and development (DDR&amp;D) is preparing a tender worth hundreds of millions of shekels to be issued in the coming weeks for the procurement of 20,000 drones that are made in Israel, a source close to the matter has told &quot;Globes.&quot; The companies that win the tender will provide drones of various types including assault drones, and surveillance and intelligence drones, in several deliveries <strong>over a period of five years</strong>. Estimates are that a range of Israeli companies will bid in the tender including Dronix, Xtend, Robotican, Tehiru, Heven Drones and CopterPix.</p>\n\n<p>The tender will mark a change in strategy by the IDF, which in recent months has preferred the Chinese drone industry over Israel&#39;s drone makers. As &quot;Globes&quot; has previously reported, the IDF has procured thousands of Chinese drones manufactured by DJI and Autel - two companies that have been blacklisted by the US Department of Defense.</p>\n\n<p>Hezbollah has a system called Aeroscope for identifying Chinese drones and locating their operators. Thus, the IDF understands the need not to be dependent on foreign drones, and the importance of supporting the long-term ability of Israeli industry to provide the strategic advantage of domestic production of the drones, which are changing the face of the battlefield, as is happening in Ukraine, for example.</p>\n\n<p>Not all drones that are currently in the possession of Israeli companies can meet the requirements of the army, due to low price requirements and the high costs of raw materials and components. As far as is known, the price that the IDF will demand is still subject to change, but it is in the range of <strong>NIS 10,000-20,000 per drone</strong> ($2750-$5600), with the lower threshold being too low from many companies&#39; point of view. While Chinese companies like DJI and Autel provide the army with a finished and cheap product, Israeli companies will be required to assemble the drones with the components that will be sought in the military tender, with the cost of some of these components, like a thermal sensor, amounting to thousands of dollars per unit.</p>\n\n<p>One of the Israeli companies expected to bid for the IDF drone tender is\u00a0Xtend, based in Ramat Hahayal in Tel Aviv, which already provides to the IDF as well as civilian installations like offshore gas rigs. The company produces drones that are relatively cheap like the Wolverine, a multi-mission UAS on which the IDF can install thermal cameras, weapons, loudspeakers or arms for opening doors. Another Israeli company that culd bid for the tender is\u00a0Robotican, which produces the Goshawk - a flying drone that can become a miniature motorized vehicle capable of performing a range of intelligence and assault missions.</p>\n\n<p>Other companies likely to bid for the IDF tender include:\u00a0Tehiru, which specializes in drones with encrypted communications that evade the enemy&#39;s electronics combat system could offer its White Widow drone;\u00a0Dronix, which manufactures the DR multi-mission series drones - the simplest of which is the DR-750, which can provide aerial surveillance for up to 35 minutes;\u00a0Heven Drones\u00a0provides the Urban drone which can remain in the air for 37 minutes and can carry up to 10 kilograms;\u00a0CopterPIX\u00a0provides a series of drones under the ERE brand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-idf-to-procure-20000-israeli-made-drones-1001487932\">https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-idf-to-procure-20000-israeli-made-drones-1001487932</a></p>\n\n<p>The IDF is heavily utilizing small drones in Gaza for virtually any function imaginable. From FPV drones to Mavic&#39;s, to UGV&#39;s for both observation, suicide hits, bomb dropping drones, exploring buildings, tunnels.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s interesting to see if Israel can pull this through and at what price point will the drones come at eventually. I doubt the price range mentioned can be achieved for most functions at 20k scale production over several years.</p>\n</div>",

Kostiantynivka would be pressured from the direction of Chasiv Yar, Toretsk *and* Pokrovsk.\n\nTo the south the immediate danger is of course everything east between Kurakhove-Selydove. But more importantly the loss of that area puts immense pressure on the Vuhledar sector, areas that from what I understand are heavily reinforced.\n\nI think there's an issue with the belief that \"once Russia has taken X they're spent\" is the assumption that whatever comes after X is equally defendable. It isn't. There was *a lot* of that talk during Avdiivka - That the offensive would halt after Avdiivka because they would've lost too much of their offensive capability. That evidently wasn't true.

Those heights complicates the hold on Kostiantynivka which in turn is practically the door into Kramatorisk-Sloviansk. All of whom are necessary if they&#39;re to achieve their war goal of taking the entire Donbass. Kostiantynivka would be pressured from the direction of Chasiv Yar, Toretsk <em>and</em> Pokrovsk.</p>\n\n<p>To the south the immediate danger is of course everything east between Kurakhove-Selydove. But more importantly the loss of that area puts immense pressure on the Vuhledar sector, areas that from what I understand are heavily reinforced.</p>\n\n<p>I think there&#39;s an issue with the belief that &quot;once Russia has taken X they&#39;re spent&quot; is the assumption that whatever comes after X is equally defendable. It isn&#39;t. There was <em>a lot</em> of that talk during Avdiivka - That the offensive would halt after Avdiivka because they would&#39;ve lost too much of their offensive capability. That evidently wasn&#39;t true. Nor was it true after Bakhmut.</p>\n</div>",

The consent can be grudging, and there can be dissidents, but no government can operate without it; even juntas need troops that will follow orders, and no one has a sufficiently strong military or police force to actively control an arbitrarily restive population.  This is why dictatorships spend so much effort (and they certainly do) on cloaking themselves with a veneer of legitimacy, and it is why those same dictatorships can fall overnight when their theory of legitimacy fails.  (Russia has seen this before: both the Tsars and the Soviets fell when they could no longer maintain their legitimacy.)\n\nSo, how do sufficiently disgruntled citizens of an authoritarian government resist?  There are many ways, apart from risky and potentially self-sacrificial protest or direct attacks (assassinations, bombings, etc.) on state actors (though both can also happen).  The simplest is to stop doing their jobs, or to deliberately cut corners.  Factory workers steal materials, do shoddy (or no) work, and turn a blind eye to misdeeds by their peers.  Agricultural workers horde food, steal and sell it on the black market, and then report poor harvests; the officials who are supposed to catch them don't bother to do inspections, take bribes, or actively assist.  Soldiers and police decline to follow orders, use their powers to advance their own fortunes at the expense of the state, or plot overthrow of their superiors.  (The Berlin Wall arguably fell because various officials in East Germany more or less stopped defending the border - when getting confusing orders about what to do, they pretty much shrugged and gave up.  One of the most aggressively protected borders in Europe fell overnight.)  The vast government bureaucracies on which modern states depend are filled with workers who can crash the economy, the military, and various other things by doing their jobs poorly, corruptly, or not at all.  They may be kept in line by fear of being caught....unless they conclude that no one else is doing their jobs, either, and decide that they have little risk of being punished.\n\nThe bottom line is that, for a modern society to function (even a poorly run and authoritarian one), you need to have a whole of people more or less doing productive work to keep it running.  And those people, in turn, cannot actually be monitored and coerced all the time.  Thus, an authoritarian must ensure that a critical mass of the public accepts their rule as inevitable (if not welcomed) and thinks they have more to gain by playing along than by refusing to cooperate.  Fear can be part of that, but fear alone is sooner or later overcome by the observation that the state can't and doesn't punish everyone - and if enough people realize that at once, fear gives way to contempt (not good if you're the dictator).  State leaders thus spend a lot of effort on developing and promulgating propaganda to maintain legitimacy, and on squashing potential threats (including symbolic threats to it).  Putin is AFAICT a typical strongman, and his legitimacy is based on his ability to maintain order within Russia, to keep the Federation intact, to project strength (symbolically on behalf of his subjects) abroad and hold Russia's enemies at bay, and, for the elites, to preserve a bubble of relative peace and prosperity in which those who play along can be assured of a fairly good life.  For now, he's doing pretty well (though he has already had to survive one dramatic coup attempt, and to kill off a political opponent out of fear that, even from prison, he would become too powerful).  But  if enough Russians conclude that Putin (1) can't protect the country, (2) can't hold the country or the Federation together, or (for the elites) (3) cannot keep up his part of the \"prosperity for loyalty\" bargain, then his legitimacy will become more tenuous.  If he loses it altogether, then he'll fall (through whatever combination of Russians not bothering to maintain his government and elite rivals coming out of the woodwork to overthrow him).  I don't think a mass uprising is likely in his case, but you never know - a coup seems more probable.  Putin would be wise to keep working on those abs.",

Someone was going to post about the doom and gloom in the atmosphere today anyway, and the more even-handed posters were going to push back. Might as well be on this comment chain as on any other.\n\nEdit: I should also point out that we need to allow the smart and capable contributors here to self-police the subreddit to some extent, because no amount of moderation can substitute for that. If someone posts low quality content and gets a lot of upvotes without anyone challenging them, then I will happily intervene. I am not going to stop all of you from challenging someone who does not provide sources. That is the kind of behavior we want to see. We can delete the shitty parent comment, but that deletes the high quality replies, and in cases like this where the shitty parent comment's opinion is widespread, there is value in hearing the rebuttal. I'm not staying out of this because I think the parent comment was right or high quality, but rather because I value the high quality replies and the example they set for others.\n\nEdit2: Also also, yall don't see the things we do remove that both lack substantiation and lack effective rebuttals. Because we do remove comments like that, aggressively. But when the sub can organically police itself, I consider that a sign of a healthy and well-informed community. Credibility is not just a matter of blocking opinions you disagree with, it requires that we engage with and rationally critique those opinions. I don't want to hide that from anyone. Quite the opposite, I am rather proud of all of you for challenging the OP here.\n\nEdit3: Also also also, all of yall bitching at us about this topic, please keep doing so. I for one appreciate your concerns and your desire to make this sub a great place for high quality conversations. I might disagree a little on the specifics of this exact case, but in general I appreciate the hell out of your desire to see high quality, well sourced, objective, credible discussion. So please do keep complaining when you see something that doesn't seem to meet our standards, we also need you to keep us honest as mods.",

Currently, it looks like our front in Donbas has collapsed.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) is disorganized, with troops exhausted, weakened, and many units demoralized.\n\n\n\u201cThe reinforcements we\u2019re receiving are mostly \u2018busified\u2019\u201d (a slang term for those who were forcibly mobilized, literally meaning they were \u2018caught,\u2019 put on a bus, and drafted into the army), Ponomarenko wrote. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t help; in fact, it complicates the combat operations of the units.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that Russian forces are not advancing deeper only because they are as exhausted as the Ukrainian troops. Despite this, Ponomarenko said that the Russians maintain a significant numerical advantage and have virtually unlimited ammunition supplies.\n\n\u201cTheir offensive continues, and we cannot stop it at the moment. And the AFU operation in the Kursk region is not the reason for that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have doubts that our command has any comprehensive plan for all of this,\u201d the officer added.\n\n\n\nPonomarenko also said there\u2019s a need for more effective measures to improve discipline in the army, warning that \u201cthe situation is on the edge, and forcibly mobilized reinforcements only exacerbate it.\u201d\n\nUkrainian defender and paramedic Kateryna Polishchuk, known by the call sign \u201cPtashka,\u201d or \u201cBirdie\u201d also commented on the dire situation on the Pokrovsk front line in a Facebook post.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the Pokrovsk sector, it\u2019s a full as a*s. No exaggeration. While everyone is cheering about Kursk, Pokrovsk has a few weeks left,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe said that towns where she had coffee just a month ago are now occupied, and First Person View (FPV) drones are already targeting the town where she had lived for the past two weeks.\n\n\u201cAll the safe villages where I rested after the positions are now occupied. The deep rear, where I refueled the car and cared for the wounded, is now the front line,\u201d Polishchuk reported.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t give a s**t about the command, their ambitions, stars, and interests. The guys need help... I can\u2019t allow another Mariupol to happen,\u201d she added. \u201cI can\u2019t let hundreds of my friends die because of a few high-ranking careerist imbeciles.\u201d\n\nRussian forces have been steadily advancing towards Pokrovsk and frequently claim to have taken control of nearby villages.\n\nRussian tanks and infantry, supported by heavy artillery and air strikes, captured a key settlement and gained new ground in the eastern Donbas sector on Tuesday, Aug. 27, according to field and media reports.\n\n\nUkrainian troops, facing a 4-to-1 firepower disadvantage, were widely reported to have withdrawn from Novohrodivka, a sizable town with a pre-war population of 14,000, after three days of intense urban fighting against Kremlin forces. Despite this, by Wednesday morning, Ukraine\u2019s military had not officially confirmed the loss.\n\nAlthough total Russian control of Novohrodivka could not be fully verified by independent sources, it was clear that Kremlin forces had advanced 2 km (1.2 miles) in recent days, pushing deep into Ukrainian defenses, which were struggling to hold their positions, according to analysts.\n\nSome Ukrainian milbloggers, without providing evidence, claimed that Kyiv\u2019s troops evacuated Novohrodivka in a panic, abandoning weapons and fleeing in disarray. However, the ISW report suggested that at least some Ukrainian forces had retreated in an organized manner.\n\nOn Wednesday, some Ukrainian media outlets criticized the AFU for losing the town in just 72 hours, contrasting it with the bitter resistance seen in cities like Avdiivka and Bakhmut, where the Kremlin\u2019s forces took months and suffered thousands of casualties to achieve similar gains.\n\nIn a Wednesday editorial, Ukrainian military journalist Yuriy Butusov warned of a potential collapse in Ukrainian defenses, stating, \u201cThe situation in the Pokrovsk sector is no longer critical; it is already catastrophic. Despite Zelensky\u2019s promise, no substantial fortifications were built there. Now there is a complete loss of control at the operational and tactical levels.\u201d\n\n\nSpeaking to reporters via video link, Ukrainian army commander Oleksandr Syrsky reported that military intelligence estimates the Kremlin plans to concentrate 50,000 to 60,000 troops for its Donbas offensive. He also said that roughly one in every three combat engagements along the entire Russo-Ukrainian War front is taking place in the Pokrovsk sector.\n\nSyrsky described the situation in the Donbas sector as \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.kyivpost.com/post/38217\n\nThere are also numerous credible people on X who have sounded the alarm",

I can\u2019t allow another Mariupol to happen,\u201d she added. \u201cI can\u2019t let hundreds of my friends die because of a few high-ranking careerist imbeciles.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russian forces have been steadily advancing towards Pokrovsk and frequently claim to have taken control of nearby villages.</p>\n\n<p>Russian tanks and infantry, supported by heavy artillery and air strikes, captured a key settlement and gained new ground in the eastern Donbas sector on Tuesday, Aug. 27, according to field and media reports.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian troops, facing a 4-to-1 firepower disadvantage, were widely reported to have withdrawn from Novohrodivka, a sizable town with a pre-war population of 14,000, after three days of intense urban fighting against Kremlin forces. Despite this, by Wednesday morning, Ukraine\u2019s military had not officially confirmed the loss.</p>\n\n<p>Although total Russian control of Novohrodivka could not be fully verified by independent sources, it was clear that Kremlin forces had advanced 2 km (1.2 miles) in recent days, pushing deep into Ukrainian defenses, which were struggling to hold their positions, according to analysts.</p>\n\n<p>Some Ukrainian milbloggers, without providing evidence, claimed that Kyiv\u2019s troops evacuated Novohrodivka in a panic, abandoning weapons and fleeing in disarray. However, the ISW report suggested that at least some Ukrainian forces had retreated in an organized manner.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, some Ukrainian media outlets criticized the AFU for losing the town in just 72 hours, contrasting it with the bitter resistance seen in cities like Avdiivka and Bakhmut, where the Kremlin\u2019s forces took months and suffered thousands of casualties to achieve similar gains.</p>\n\n<p>In a Wednesday editorial, Ukrainian military journalist Yuriy Butusov warned of a potential collapse in Ukrainian defenses, stating, \u201cThe situation in the Pokrovsk sector is no longer critical; it is already catastrophic. Despite Zelensky\u2019s promise, no substantial fortifications were built there. Now there is a complete loss of control at the operational and tactical levels.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to reporters via video link, Ukrainian army commander Oleksandr Syrsky reported that military intelligence estimates the Kremlin plans to concentrate 50,000 to 60,000 troops for its Donbas offensive. He also said that roughly one in every three combat engagements along the entire Russo-Ukrainian War front is taking place in the Pokrovsk sector.</p>\n\n<p>Syrsky described the situation in the Donbas sector as \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/38217\">https://www.kyivpost.com/post/38217</a></p>\n\n<p>There are also numerous credible people on X who have sounded the alarm</p>\n</div>",
