Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has placed Moscow and its ally Beijing at odds with much of the continent.\n\n>China has consistently opposed the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine in its public statements. But many of Kyiv\u2019s backers have doubted Beijing\u2019s commitment to such deterrence, given Xi\u2019s \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Putin and a \u201cpeace plan\u201d that heavily overlaps with Russian talking points.\n\n>Xi\u2019s warning, however, has given them hope that China is backing up its public rhetoric behind closed doors \u2014 and potentially threatening consequences for their relationship that would be sufficient to stop Putin from using a nuclear weapon.\n\n>\u201cThe Chinese are taking credit for sending the message at every level,\u201d a senior US administration official said.\n\n>Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, said in March that Xi\u2019s visit \u201creduces the risk of nuclear war and they [the Chinese] have made it very, very clear\u201d.\n\n>China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But a former government official confirmed that Xi told Putin personally not to use nuclear weapons, noting that China\u2019s stance against their use was included in its position paper on peace in Ukraine.\n\n>The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\n...\n\n\n>A Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine or one of its European allies would risk turning the continent against China, the adviser said, while sustained pressure from Beijing to prevent such an act might help improve relations with the continent.\n\n>Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said that \u201cRussia has never and will never have China\u2019s approval for using nuclear weapons\u201d. If Russia used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, \u201cChina will further distance itself from Russia\u201d, he added.\n\n>Xi\u2019s warning suggests China remains worried about the war despite assurances from Putin last October that a tactical nuclear strike would not make any \u201cpolitical or military sense\u201d.\n\n>That statement came amid heightened fears in the west that Russia could use the tactical nuclear arms, which are lower-yield warheads, in response to humiliating setbacks in Ukraine.\n\n>The US, UK, and France, Nato\u2019s three nuclear powers, told the Kremlin they would strike its forces with conventional weapons if it used tactical nuclear arms. In the wake of the warnings, Putin abandoned his rhetoric and did not mention tactical nuclear weapons publicly for several months.\n\n>People close to the Kremlin say the Russian leader independently decided that tactical nuclear weapons would not give Russia an advantage after projecting scenarios resulting from their use. A nuclear strike was likely to turn areas that Putin has claimed for Russia into an irradiated wasteland while doing little to help his forces advance, the people said.",

From the [U.K.\u2019s](https://www.ft.com/content/8cd1c388-6fb9-497b-a8a9-14b6ea21ede2) armed forces chief:\n\n> Last year it fired 10mn artillery shells but at best can produce 1mn shells a year. \n\nThat estimate is roughly 3-4x *higher* than [claims](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1611034054899470336 ) from Russian milbloggers. But it\u2019s roughly a third of what the head of [Estonian](https://news.err.ee/1608815692/edf-intelligence-chief-russia-still-has-long-term-offensive-capabilities) military intelligence claimed. There could be some wiggle room to explain the delta in the form of caliber, but they both agree that Russia had expended 10mm shells in roughly 10 months of the war last year. \n\nInterestingly, the [last](https://www.rusi.org/events/members-events/annual-chief-defence-staff-lecture-2022-admiral-sir-tony-radakin) time Radakin spoke of Russian ammo production in front of RUSI, he didn\u2019t provide hard numbers, but he did specifically mention the *NSA* and MI6. It\u2019s probably not a stretch to assume that these numbers, therefore, are from SIGINT privy to Five Eyes. \n\nSo, last year, Russia expended roughly 33k shells/day on average (with a high standard deviation). We should also assume that it had 10mm shells from its Soviet inheritance, heading into 2023. A decent chunk of that would probably not be serviceable (can\u2019t recall who, but saw a claim for 50% from a credible source when pictures of rusted artillery shells were  shared widely, to dissuade people from assuming all old shells would be that bad.) Then there are ammunition dumps that have been blown up, which would be offset by drawing on Belarusian stocks. Thus far, there\u2019s little evidence to suggest major contributions from Iran and NK, but it shouldn\u2019t be discounted. Lastly, the most credible recent reporting we have on Russian spend rates is 10k shells/day at the very low end, to most sources triangulating somewhere between 15-20k/day. We heard from many pro-Russians claiming that Prigozhin was fabricating the shell hunger in Bakhmut, but that\u2019s probably something to ignore. \n\nKeeping in mind that the Russian MoD has probably been rationing ammo burn rates, it\u2019s conceivable that Russia has chewed through close to 40% of the serviceable component of its 10mm Soviet reserve in the first 6 months of this year. Does that mean the Russians are going to \u201crun out\u201d of ammo by the end of the year? Obviously not. But does it mean the ratio of Russian to Ukrainian fires can continue converging? Very probably. \n\nAnother subjective and qualitative factor in this is the accuracy of artillery guns, and how many precise shells Ukraine has received from the West (over 7k rounds,) versus the relatively lower stocks of Krasnopol/etc. Russian troops have available. Then there\u2019s tubes. Mortars are also an area where the Russians have a clear advantage. Given Ukraine\u2019s lack of air superiority, a novice opinion would be that they would need at least 2-3x (if not more) localized artillery fire superiority to push through Russian lines. That would/could explain some of the tactics being employed at the front, and why time would be a key ingredient of success.",

It\u2019s probably not a stretch to assume that these numbers, therefore, are from SIGINT privy to Five Eyes. </p>\n\n<p>So, last year, Russia expended roughly 33k shells/day on average (with a high standard deviation). We should also assume that it had 10mm shells from its Soviet inheritance, heading into 2023. A decent chunk of that would probably not be serviceable (can\u2019t recall who, but saw a claim for 50% from a credible source when pictures of rusted artillery shells were  shared widely, to dissuade people from assuming all old shells would be that bad.) Then there are ammunition dumps that have been blown up, which would be offset by drawing on Belarusian stocks. Thus far, there\u2019s little evidence to suggest major contributions from Iran and NK, but it shouldn\u2019t be discounted. Lastly, the most credible recent reporting we have on Russian spend rates is 10k shells/day at the very low end, to most sources triangulating somewhere between 15-20k/day. We heard from many pro-Russians claiming that Prigozhin was fabricating the shell hunger in Bakhmut, but that\u2019s probably something to ignore. </p>\n\n<p>Keeping in mind that the Russian MoD has probably been rationing ammo burn rates, it\u2019s conceivable that Russia has chewed through close to 40% of the serviceable component of its 10mm Soviet reserve in the first 6 months of this year. Does that mean the Russians are going to \u201crun out\u201d of ammo by the end of the year? Obviously not. But does it mean the ratio of Russian to Ukrainian fires can continue converging? Very probably. </p>\n\n<p>Another subjective and qualitative factor in this is the accuracy of artillery guns, and how many precise shells Ukraine has received from the West (over 7k rounds,) versus the relatively lower stocks of Krasnopol/etc. Russian troops have available. Then there\u2019s tubes. Mortars are also an area where the Russians have a clear advantage. Given Ukraine\u2019s lack of air superiority, a novice opinion would be that they would need at least 2-3x (if not more) localized artillery fire superiority to push through Russian lines. That would/could explain some of the tactics being employed at the front, and why time would be a key ingredient of success.</p>\n</div>",

In the 70s the arrival of the microprocessor changed war and war fighting. You could not perform thousands of calculations a second on a microchip. Lol, thousands in 2023.

Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov reported on July 4 that Ukrainian forces are performing their main task of destroying Russian manpower, equipment, fuel depots, artillery, and air defenses and that a \u201cwar of destruction is equal to a war of kilometers.\u201d[1] Danilov\u2019s assessment underlines the prioritization of Ukraine\u2019s ongoing campaign to attrit Russian manpower and assets over attempting to conduct massive sweeping mechanized maneuvers to regain large swaths of territory rapidly. NATO Military Committee Chair Admiral Bob Bauer reported on July 3 that Ukrainian forces are correct to proceed cautiously and avoid high casualties in the counteroffensive and acknowledged that the counteroffensive is difficult due to landmines and other obstacles up to 30km deep into Russian-occupied territory.[2] Bauer stated that Ukrainian forces should not face criticism or pressure for moving slowly.\n\n>Ukrainian forces have liberated territory in multiple areas of the front since the start of the counteroffensive in early June. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar reported on June 3 that Ukrainian forces have liberated a total of 37.4 square kilometers in eastern and southern Ukraine in the past week.[3] Ukrainian forces are continuing to make steady, gradual advances.\n\n>The current pace of Ukrainian operations is not indicative of a stalemate or evidence that Ukraine cannot retake large areas. Ukrainian forces conducted slow and gradual interdiction campaigns against Russian concentration areas in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast and limited ground attacks on the west (right) bank between August and November of 2022, before finally forcing the Russian withdrawal from the right bank in mid-November.[4] The situation in southern Ukraine is different, of course, because there is no natural bottleneck of the sort created by Russian reliance on the two bridges over the Dnipro. The Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson nevertheless alternated phases of relatively rapid advance with long periods of preparation, combat focused on attritting Russian forces, and limited gains that ultimately made Russian positions on the west bank of the river untenable.  By contrast, the Russian winter-spring offensive culminated in just over one month without making significant gains along the Luhansk-Kharkiv Oblast border.[5]  The current Ukrainian counter-offensive is less dramatic and rapid than the one that liberated much of Kharkiv Oblast, more successful than the failed Russian winter offensive, and generally most like the slower but ultimately successful Kherson counteroffensive in its pace and initial progress.\n\n>Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations on at least four sectors of the front and advanced on July 4. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian ground attacks in the Lyman direction.[6] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces continue counteroffensive operations in the Bakhmut area, in the western Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, and in western Zaporizhia Oblast.[7] Ukrainian military officials stated that Ukrainian forces have made some unspecified advances on Bakhmut\u2019s northern and southern flanks, and a prominent Russian milblogger also claimed that Ukrainian forces advanced north of Bakhmut.[8] Ukrainian Tavrisk Group of Forces Spokesperson Valery Shershen stated that Ukrainian forces advanced up to two kilometers in the western Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, and a Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces reached Pryyutne, 15 kilometers southwest of Velyka Novosilka in western Donetsk Oblast.[9] Geolocated footage confirms that Ukrainian forces made additional advances south of Orikhiv in western Zaporizhia Oblast.[10]\n\n>Russian and Ukrainian officials escalated their rhetoric surrounding the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) on July 4, but Russia is likely focused on accusing Ukraine of irresponsible actions around the ZNPP including setting conditions for a possible false flag attack. Russia remains unlikely to generate a radiological incident at the ZNPP at this time. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on July 4 that Ukrainian officials have begun preparations for a potential Russian provocation at the ZNPP \u201cin the near future\u201d and warned that Russian forces placed objects \u201cresembling explosive devices\u201d on the outer roofs of the ZNPP\u2019s third and fourth reactors in order to blame damage to these areas on Ukrainian shelling.[11] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed this statement in his nightly address on July 4, and other Ukrainian military sources warned of possible Russian provocations at the plant.[12] As ISW has previously reported, it is unlikely that limited Russian sabotage at the ZNPP that Russian could hope to blame on Ukraine would be able to generate a massive radiological incident, as the ZNPP\u2019s reactors were constructed to withstand considerable damage.[13] Ukrainian military sources reiterated this assessment and noted that even if the purported explosive devices detonate, the damage would not harm the reactor but would rather create the false impression that Ukrainian forces had shelled the reactors.[14] Advisor to the head of Russian nuclear energy operator Rosenergoatom, Renat Karchaa, also claimed on July 4 that Ukraine is planning to strike the ZNPP overnight on July 4-5.[15] ISW has previously assessed that such provocative Russian statements, and even the possibility of a tangible provocation at the plant, are likely part of a Russian wider information operation meant to accuse Ukraine of irresponsibility at the ZNPP ahead of the upcoming NATO summit and dissuade Ukrainian forces from conducting counteroffensive operations against occupied Zaporizhia Oblast.[16]\n\n>The reported reorganization of Russian internal security organs suggests that the Kremlin has not yet concluded that it has effectively neutralized the threats of future armed rebellions following the Wagner Group\u2019s June 23-24 rebellion. Russian outlet Vedomosti reported on July 3, citing internal law enforcement sources, that Russian law enforcement authorities are considering reassigning the \u201cGrom\u201d special units of the Russian Federal Drug Control Service (part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs) to Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard).[17] Vedomosti noted that this reported change follows Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s meeting with heads of various Russian law enforcement agencies on June 26 in the wake of the Wagner armed rebellion.[18] Several Russian sources spoke out against the reported transfer of \u201dGrom\u201d to Rosgvardia, citing overall poorer equipment, training, and leadership quality.[19] Vedomosti claimed that Alexander Khinstein, former advisor to Rosgvardia Head Viktor Zolotov, warned that the assignment of \u201dGrom\u201d units to Rosgvardia would be a \u201ddangerous experiment.\u201d[20] The alleged restructuring of Russia\u2019s internal security forces suggests that the Kremlin is working to build an effective anti-rebellion force following Wagner\u2019s armed rebellion. The fact that these purported changes are happening following the rebellion indicates that the Kremlin was correctly dissatisfied with the performance of security forces, which failed to stop or even contest Wagner\u2019s march on Moscow, and suggests that the Kremlin has not ruled out the risk of future such rebellions.\n\n>Russian authorities are absolving Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin of financial responsibility for damages caused by the Wagner Group rebellion and reportedly returned significant liquid assets to Prigozhin, possibly as part of the deal negotiated between Putin, Prigozhin, and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. The Rostov-on-Don administration claimed that the total damages from Prigozhin\u2019s rebellion amounted to 92.5 million rubles (roughly $1 million), and that the administration will not recover damages from Prigozhin or the Wagner Group.[21] St. Petersburg news outlet Fontanka claimed, citing internal sources, that Russian authorities returned over 10 billion rubles (roughly $111 million) in cash, five gold bars, and hundreds of thousands of US dollars in cash to Prigozhin on July 2 that authorities had seized from Prigozhin-affiliated facilities in St. Petersburg on June 24.[22] Fontanka claimed that authorities only reversed their decision to hold onto Prigozhin\u2018s liquid assets on July 2 but did not specify a reason for the reversal. The legal basis that Russian authorities would have had for seizing Prigozhin\u2019s assets remains unclear in any case, as Russian authorities dropped criminal charges against Prigozhin for the rebellion.[23] A prominent Russian milblogger claimed that part of Prigozhin\u2019s liquid assets were supposed to be compensation to the families of Russian pilots whom Wagner forces killed during the rebellion, but it is now uncertain whether Wagner will make those payments.[24] The milblogger assessed that Wagner will likely use at least part of the returned assets to support transferring Wagner Group personnel to Belarus.",

The legal basis that Russian authorities would have had for seizing Prigozhin\u2019s assets remains unclear in any case, as Russian authorities dropped criminal charges against Prigozhin for the rebellion.[23] A prominent Russian milblogger claimed that part of Prigozhin\u2019s liquid assets were supposed to be compensation to the families of Russian pilots whom Wagner forces killed during the rebellion, but it is now uncertain whether Wagner will make those payments.[24] The milblogger assessed that Wagner will likely use at least part of the returned assets to support transferring Wagner Group personnel to Belarus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

            "body": ">The official Chechen response to an attack against a Russian opposition journalist in Chechnya may impact Chechen Republic Head Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s standing in the Russian ultranationalist information space. Russian opposition outlet Novaya Gazeta reported on July 4 that unspecified, masked actors in Grozny, Chechnya intercepted a car containing one of its journalists, Yelena Milashina, severely assaulted Milashina, destroyed her equipment and documents, and warned Milashina against writing \u201canything.\u201d[25] Milashina traveled to Chechnya in order to cover the trial of Zarema Musayeva, the mother of an exiled Chechen opposition activist, and the attackers also assaulted Musayeva\u2019s lawyer, Alexander Nemov, who was in the car with Milashina. Chechen courts sentenced Musayeva to five and a half years in prison on July 5 for alleged fraud and attacking Chechen authorities, but some Russian opposition voices claimed that Chechen authorities prosecuted Musayeva due to her son\u2018s activism.[26] Prominent Russian ultranationalist voices seized on Milashina\u2019s attack despite its lack of relevance to the war in Ukraine likely out of concern for broader press censorship.[27] The voices condemned attacks against journalists \u2013 including Milashina \u2013 as unacceptable even though they disagree with Milashina.[28] The Russian Union of Journalists and the Russian Human Rights Council both issued statements of condemnation and opened investigations into the attack.[29]\n\n>Kadyrov\u2019s prominence in the broader Russian information space will likely force Kadyrov to choose between preserving his regime and his support in the ultranationalist information space, however. Kadyrov\u2019s response was a brief acknowledgment that the relevant Chechen authorities are investigating the \u201dincident\u201d - a response inconsistent in tone and content with Kadyrov\u2019s usual flamboyant, long-winded messaging.[30] Kadyrov previously condemned Milashina as a \u201dterrorist\u201d and demanded her detention, which is largely consistent with his overall effort to retain his authoritarian rule in Chechnya.[31] If Kadyrov supports the investigation into Milashina\u2019s attack, he risks undermining his domestic regime and crackdowns against Chechen opposition voices. But if Kadyrov refuses to support the investigation, then he risks undermining his standing within an information space that is hypersensitive to the prospect of increased censorship. Kadyrov already struggles to balance these dual aims in his force arrayment in Ukraine; Kadyrov portrays Akhmat forces as capable fighters against Ukraine but has simultaneously largely avoided committing them intensive and attritional combat, and some Russian milbloggers have complained that Chechen forces are distracted posing online while other Russian forces actually fight.[32]  Chechen forces notably failed to engage Prigozhin\u2019s rebels despite ostentatiously mobilizing and moving ostensibly to fight them, although Putin might have directed Kadyrov to avoid combat with Wagner forces.[33]\n\n>Russia is reportedly forming a new combined arms army as part of the Northern Fleet, likely in order to posture its preparedness against NATO. Russian news outlet Izvestia reported that Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) sources claimed that the existing 14th Army Corps of the Northern Fleet will be reformed into the new combined arms army with motorized rifle brigades, divisions, and regiments subordinate to it.[34] Izvestia suggested that the 14th Army Corps\u2018 200th and 80th Brigades will be reorganized into a division under the new combined arms army.[35] Russian army corps before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine existed only within fleets and largely performed the same functions as combined arms armies. The reported decision to form a new combined arms army is thus likely posturing ahead of the NATO summit on July 11-12 intended to show Russia\u2019s military response to the accession of Finland and possibly Sweden to the alliance. The promotion of the 14th Army Corps to a combined arms army level will not by itself increase Russian combat capacity, and it is unclear where the Russian military leadership could find the personnel and equipment that would be needed for the new organization to generate a material difference.\n\n>The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted a drone attack on Moscow Oblast and Novaya Moskva on July 4. The Russian MoD claimed that Russian air defenses shot down and electronic warfare suppressed five of five Ukrainian drones.[36] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian air defenses destroyed two drones near Valuevo, electronic warfare suppressed one in the Odinstovo Raion, one drone fell near Krivosheino, and one flew toward a military unit in Kubinka - likely the Russian airbase there.[37] One Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces may have intended to strike Vnukovo Airport, and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced that Russian authorities temporarily redirected some flights from Vnukovo Airport in response to the drones.[38] Another milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces may have conducted the drone attack in retaliation for an alleged Russian strike on a Ukrainian Security Services (SBU) building in Sumy Oblast.[39]\n\n>Key Takeaways:\n\n>    Ukrainian forces appear to be focusing on creating an asymmetrical attrition gradient that conserves Ukrainian manpower at the cost of a slower rate of territorial gains, while gradually wearing down Russian manpower and equipment.

        "body": "A major Lavrov's interview for a Western media outlet (TV Portugal) and as such aimed at the Western audience. It is worth reading not as a reflection of the objective reality but of one of the subjective realities involved - it gives insight into how the Kremlin sees this conflict and the way out. It is interesting (though unsurprising) to see that they feel they have been deceived by Germany and France over the Minsk agreement, they have zero trust in any further promises. The threat of nuclear war is firmly and repeatedly linked to the Western plans to inflict \"a strategic defeat\" on Russia.\n\n[https://mid](https://mid) . ru/tv/?id=1894888&lang=en\n\n*\\[asked about the fear of nuclear war\\]*\n\n\\- When President Putin was asked whether Russia would use nuclear weapons, he provided a detailed answer. My key message is to look at and analyse what the EU and NATO leaders say. This is flat-out aggressive rhetoric. They keep repeating the mantra that Russia must suffer a \u201cstrategic defeat.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\\- Maybe, Portugal doesn\u2019t have many strategic analysts, but many other EU and NATO countries surely have them (the Pentagon certainly does). They keep threatening Russia (a nuclear power) with \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d every day and for the whole world to hear.\n\n*Do you think a nuclear conflict is possible?*\r  \n\r\n\n\\- I answered this question earlier. You should ask this question to the people who want to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia.\n\n\\- *\\[on Minsk agreement\\]* We have heard lots of lies and false promises from the West. I\u2019m not saying this to keep searching for arguments to back our past or current policies, but to re-confirm the fact that we have learned our lesson. We are no longer looking to the past, but to the future. The past has taught us a good lesson. So, looking into the future and based on the current situation in our country and internationally, we will proceed to build our future without relying on our deceitful colleagues who are incapable of holding up their end of the bargain, our former Western partners.\n\n\\- Never again during the life of the current politicians and the generation that will come after us, at least not when it comes to developing strategic sectors of the economy and areas that are critical for the sovereignty and independence of the Russian Federation, will we rely on \u201cprojects\u201d involving our Western colleagues. *\\[they are beyond bitter about this\\]*\n\n\\- Of course, figures like EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and virtually the entire US administration are talking about inflicting a \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d on Russia on the battlefield.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A major Lavrov&#39;s interview for a Western media outlet (TV Portugal) and as such aimed at the Western audience. It is worth reading not as a reflection of the objective reality but of one of the subjective realities involved - it gives insight into how the Kremlin sees this conflict and the way out. It is interesting (though unsurprising) to see that they feel they have been deceived by Germany and France over the Minsk agreement, they have zero trust in any further promises. The threat of nuclear war is firmly and repeatedly linked to the Western plans to inflict &quot;a strategic defeat&quot; on Russia.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mid\">https://mid</a> . ru/tv/?id=1894888&amp;lang=en</p>\n\n<p><em>[asked about the fear of nuclear war]</em></p>\n\n<p>- When President Putin was asked whether Russia would use nuclear weapons, he provided a detailed answer. My key message is to look at and analyse what the EU and NATO leaders say. This is flat-out aggressive rhetoric. They keep repeating the mantra that Russia must suffer a \u201cstrategic defeat.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>- Maybe, Portugal doesn\u2019t have many strategic analysts, but many other EU and NATO countries surely have them (the Pentagon certainly does). They keep threatening Russia (a nuclear power) with \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d every day and for the whole world to hear.</p>\n\n<p><em>Do you think a nuclear conflict is possible?</em></p>\n\n<p>- I answered this question earlier. You should ask this question to the people who want to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia.</p>\n\n<p>- <em>[on Minsk agreement]</em> We have heard lots of lies and false promises from the West. I\u2019m not saying this to keep searching for arguments to back our past or current policies, but to re-confirm the fact that we have learned our lesson. We are no longer looking to the past, but to the future. The past has taught us a good lesson. So, looking into the future and based on the current situation in our country and internationally, we will proceed to build our future without relying on our deceitful colleagues who are incapable of holding up their end of the bargain, our former Western partners.</p>\n\n<p>- Never again during the life of the current politicians and the generation that will come after us, at least not when it comes to developing strategic sectors of the economy and areas that are critical for the sovereignty and independence of the Russian Federation, will we rely on \u201cprojects\u201d involving our Western colleagues. <em>[they are beyond bitter about this]</em></p>\n\n<p>- Of course, figures like EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and virtually the entire US administration are talking about inflicting a \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d on Russia on the battlefield. They don\u2019t mention talks, only the battlefield. We are ready to keep working on the battlefield and will do so. We know what we are fighting for. </p>\n\n<p>- We are fighting to eliminate a direct military threat to our security, which, contrary to its assurances, the West is creating right on Russia\u2019s borders as it drags Ukraine into its game and is promising it NATO membership once again.

Further below is how I see it.\n\nSimply put, Zelensky suddenly became a wildcard for Russia. On one hand, before the Ukrainian elections he was less hawkish more peace seeking candidate, on the other hand he changed his mind after the very first negotiations, because he didn't want to accept Putin's strong position in these negotiations. Zelensky's whole campaign was built on the premise that the conflict is unresolved due to Poroshenko's corruption.\n\nPoroshenko himself, while being more hawkish, is an oligarch, a kind of person that Putin worked with his whole political career. Poroshenko KNOWS the rules, he is all about rhetorics in public, but willing to negotiate behind the closed door, willing to accept that Putin's here in a strong position and could exercise it by force if he wants too, so he's at least somewhat careful in his actions.\n\nIn comes Zelensky in 2019. Tries to deliver on his promise, goes into negotiations, sees that Putin wants no compromise and immediately undermines Putin's strong position, rejects it, refuses to play by the rules, so to speak. So Putin slowly starts to lose his patience, but at the worst the conflict can be left frozen and he has much to do in his own country during COVID. Then in 2021 Zelensky suddenly attacks pro-Russian media, goes after Medvedchuk personally and that is a big insult to Putin. Not only Zelensky is not willing to negotiate, he goes onto this sort of media offensive (prosecuting pro-Russian channels = trying to cut Russian propaganda that half of Ukraine consumes, which undermines Russian soft power), all that while attacking Putin's close friend.\n\nPutin then decides to show off his hard power instead and we see first big Russian troops gathering at Ukrainian border in spring-summer. He wants to scare Zelensky like he scared Poroshenko back in 2014-2015, but Zelensky basically calls his bluff and does not back off. But Russia is not ready for war at the moment, so the troops go back and the planning starts. \n\nIn my opinion, this has nothing to do with NATO specifically, but rather that with Zelensky's presidency, Putin felt like Ukraine is gonna leave Russian sphere of influence for good, when even with warmongering Poroshenko they could still do business. Ukraine was not closer to NATO in 2021 than before, budget wise Zelensky even made military cuts to dive into his economical reforms, infrastructural changes, etc., but Zelensky rejected Putin's strong position because he seemingly to the last minute did not believe Putin could exercise it.",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This might be bias on my part, but I think the discussion in the West is focused too much on NATO-Ukraine, when the reasons for the change in Putin&#39;s decision making lie in Russia-Ukraine politics. Further below is how I see it.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, Zelensky suddenly became a wildcard for Russia. On one hand, before the Ukrainian elections he was less hawkish more peace seeking candidate, on the other hand he changed his mind after the very first negotiations, because he didn&#39;t want to accept Putin&#39;s strong position in these negotiations. Zelensky&#39;s whole campaign was built on the premise that the conflict is unresolved due to Poroshenko&#39;s corruption.</p>\n\n<p>Poroshenko himself, while being more hawkish, is an oligarch, a kind of person that Putin worked with his whole political career. Poroshenko KNOWS the rules, he is all about rhetorics in public, but willing to negotiate behind the closed door, willing to accept that Putin&#39;s here in a strong position and could exercise it by force if he wants too, so he&#39;s at least somewhat careful in his actions.</p>\n\n<p>In comes Zelensky in 2019. Tries to deliver on his promise, goes into negotiations, sees that Putin wants no compromise and immediately undermines Putin&#39;s strong position, rejects it, refuses to play by the rules, so to speak. So Putin slowly starts to lose his patience, but at the worst the conflict can be left frozen and he has much to do in his own country during COVID. Then in 2021 Zelensky suddenly attacks pro-Russian media, goes after Medvedchuk personally and that is a big insult to Putin. Not only Zelensky is not willing to negotiate, he goes onto this sort of media offensive (prosecuting pro-Russian channels = trying to cut Russian propaganda that half of Ukraine consumes, which undermines Russian soft power), all that while attacking Putin&#39;s close friend.</p>\n\n<p>Putin then decides to show off his hard power instead and we see first big Russian troops gathering at Ukrainian border in spring-summer. He wants to scare Zelensky like he scared Poroshenko back in 2014-2015, but Zelensky basically calls his bluff and does not back off. But Russia is not ready for war at the moment, so the troops go back and the planning starts. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, this has nothing to do with NATO specifically, but rather that with Zelensky&#39;s presidency, Putin felt like Ukraine is gonna leave Russian sphere of influence for good, when even with warmongering Poroshenko they could still do business.
