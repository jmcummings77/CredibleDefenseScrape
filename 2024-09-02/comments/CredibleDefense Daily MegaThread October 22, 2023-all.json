      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Without these, the Russians would face serious challenges. Regrettably, the Western equivalents (long-range recon drones with a 100 km range and a 12-hour loiter time) are available in very limited quantities and are usually quite expensive.\n\n[RUSI published a report on the Orlans](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/orlan-complex-tracking-supply-chains-russias-most-successful-uav), aiming to curtail the supply of components used by the drone's manufacturer.

And I spent years struggling to overcome acquisition malpractice, and we\u2019re still struggling with that to some degree,\u201d Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told reporters during a Defense Writers Group meeting.\n\nBoth the Air Force and Navy have openly talked about NGAD getting away from being entirely one prime contractor calling the shots on who subcontracts what out, and instead, open things to competition - which should open the door for smaller players to get in the game because it is easier for smaller businesses to fight and innovate in smaller components. For instance, [the Navy has said](https://news.usni.org/2021/03/30/navy-ngad-will-be-family-of-systems-super-hornet-replacement-likely-a-manned-fighter):\n\n>The Navy is working with the Air Force \u2013 which is pursuing its own NGAD program \u2013 during the concept refinement stage. Harris said that while he expects the two services to have different air frames, the systems inside the platforms will be similar.\n\n>\u201cSo if you think about it, a contractor may have a particular sensor \u2013 let\u2019s just use the radar as an example \u2013 and over time, perhaps the performance of that radar isn\u2019t what you want, either from a sustainability standpoint or purely from a capability standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that open mission system architecture, you have an ability to more rapidly replace that without getting into vendor lock. And we\u2019ve seen vendor lock create problems for us before. We firmly believe that competition will give us a better reliability, lower sustainment costs and lower the overall costs.\u201d\n\n>The Navy is also open to different contractors joining forces to tackle NGAD, an avenue Harris said he has urged industry to pursue.\n\n>\u201cOur industry primes get very comfortable with the folks they\u2019ve worked with in the past. Some of that\u2019s worked out very well for us, other times it may not have worked as well as we would have liked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just recommended they broaden their view and look at as many of those folks as we can to team. We also think this will enable a lot of the smaller companies to be able to work into niche markets that they may be very successful in.\u201d",

You can project fire a very short distance in front of you, and there's a very real chance of it blowing back in your face.\n\nMeanwhile, RPGs and similar weapons have proliferated and improved massively since WW2.\n\nSo simple question: You're in Ukraine, and there's a pill box you need to get past. Would you rather:\n\n1. Move to within about 30 feet, presumably under fire, while wearing two giant tanks of agonizing death on your back if you get hit by the wrong munition, or\n2. Stay 500+ feet away, pop up from cover and hit it with an RPG.\n\nThe answer is pretty clear.\n\nI also feel like discussions of this category of weapon invite a particular sort of nastiness, in that people are anchoring on the cruelty of the weapon as a virtue and not thinking about its downsides in terms of pure effectiveness, let alone morality.\n\nNote this is a general objection of mine on the topic, not targeted at the comment above directly.",

You apply no nuance to their actions but sweep it all under the same rug. And I don't see you objecting to the videos coming out of Gaza where clearly 100 civilians have died and we don't even know if a single Hamas operative has died.\n\n>But it is used. Which proves that Israel does care about civilian casualties. Why didn't you answer my question, why is roof knocking used it Israel does not care about civilian casualties?\n\nNo, that's the proof that they don't care. Otherwise roof knocking would be continually and regularly used. But it's not. \n\n>Do you have a credible source on the number of civilians killed in Gaza? Note that Hamas casualties claimed have been shown non credible in the hospital event where they inflated the killed number by roughly 10 times.
