I have investigated a bit on VK and as far as I have found (like in [here](https://i.imgur.com/OXs7r6y.jpeg), as well as in other posts), any Russian citizen can travel to Moscow and sign the contract, with travel and lodging expenses fully reimbursed if the contract gets signed. This, after all, has been the standard so far for the vast majority of the other offers, and it's critical to the success of the offer itself as many men interested in signing a contract come from poorer regions that cannot afford certain figures. \n\nI can confirm that over the last two months the bonuses for contract signing have been growing a lot - the increase actually concerns the bonuses themselves, rather than the monthly salary (which seems to have remained stationary at 210 thousand Rubles + any addition of the federal subject + bonuses in case of progress in the battlefield, direct involvement in combat etc). This could be a sign both of issues in keeping up the pace of volunteers compared to the past months and to 2023, as well as a consequence of the competition from the hot labor market, with specialized jobs in the defense sector having reached 100/150 thousand Rubles in quite a lot of regions now.\n\nBonuses for contract signing exceeded 1 million Rubles for the first time in November 2023 if I recall correctly, with an offer from the city of Saint Petersburg (thanks to the financial support from local construction companies too). Let's remember that it's the federal subject giving the highest bonus the benchmark, considering the possibility of signing contracts in that place from all over Russia. Top bonuses remained  steady for about 6 months, and since late May / early June onwards there has indeed been a very noticeable increase. I remember being surprised when around a month and a half ago I saw a 1,3 million Rubles bonus for contract service (again in an offer from Saint Petersburg) in the 76th VDV Division, in the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and in units of the 44th Corps; in early July bonuses from other federal subjects reached 1,5 million Rubles, and now it's already at 1,9 million!",

Based on what he&#39;s written before, it seems that the UAF use of ex-con volunteers varies unit by unit. Some are treating them as normal replacements, others are placing them into all convict battalions, like the 24th Mech Bde. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zahid.espreso.tv/viyna-z-rosiyeyu-u-24-y-ombr-ukraintsi-yaki-vidbuvali-uvyaznennya-voyuvatimut-u-batalyoni-kharakterniki\">https://zahid.espreso.tv/viyna-z-rosiyeyu-u-24-y-ombr-ukraintsi-yaki-vidbuvali-uvyaznennya-voyuvatimut-u-batalyoni-kharakterniki</a></p>\n\n<p>Overall, I hope the UAF won&#39;t be using their convicts as wastefully as Wagner was in particular, as Ukraine definitely doesn&#39;t have the prison population to sustain that. </p>\n\n<p>But there are definitely times when assaults are going to be bloody regardless of planning/preparation, or when a minefield needs to be cleared by hand, so it&#39;s nice to have dedicated units to perform those roles who are more expendable that the better units, who can be sparred and used more effectively. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like forming &quot;penal&quot; units of malcontents to conduct assaults and sapper duties (which the UAF are also doing on a pretty wide scale), that&#39;s a far wiser use of manpower than imprisoning them after a court martial (though I&#39;m surprised they made that work without at least an unofficial option of a death sentence verdict for courts martial).</p>\n</div>",

Finally something actually useful, however I have no idea what a tracking mount with data link means and how it differs so much with a handheld rangefinder, I do not understand this disruption, if someones could explains to me that would be great.\n\nedit: googling give me a better idea of what a tracking mount is\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?sca\\_esv=bf721e085700f33c&sca\\_upv=1&rlz=1C1VDKB\\_frFR1053FR1053&sxsrf=ADLYWILqFxBYNOxmx\\_zW6NEXdCmneArkBA:1721826015918&q=tracking+mount&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J\\_86uWOeqwdnV0yaSF-x2jornR9l9QoC\\_W7eufnFEmyEHeDjy4O0OWyYQ0fz3JjBQfGYnxplk1tJrXWXGVUQmsq8GmAE9Q1XW7FW1vkgCJssYdAy0IKQq2tR8PJjONL933B-eBuE-V0FnNrJe0NHfwCxxYP0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8sazg3b-HAxXjcKQEHbbhAawQtKgLegQIGBAB&biw=1536&bih=703&dpr=2.5](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=bf721e085700f33c&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1VDKB_frFR1053FR1053&sxsrf=ADLYWILqFxBYNOxmx_zW6NEXdCmneArkBA:1721826015918&q=tracking+mount&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J_86uWOeqwdnV0yaSF-x2jornR9l9QoC_W7eufnFEmyEHeDjy4O0OWyYQ0fz3JjBQfGYnxplk1tJrXWXGVUQmsq8GmAE9Q1XW7FW1vkgCJssYdAy0IKQq2tR8PJjONL933B-eBuE-V0FnNrJe0NHfwCxxYP0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj8sazg3b-HAxXjcKQEHbbhAawQtKgLegQIGBAB&biw=1536&bih=703&dpr=2.5)\n\nI guess it significantly improve accuracy via stability, however it reduces mobility unless mounted on a vehicle.

As such, I mostly deal with the more dangerous areas, and less with Europe/USA whatnot. Major news agencies that put out daily podcasts focus too much on US and European issues, which is fine, but not really useful to me in this context.\n\nThanks!",

It's like they wrote the book on getting their opponents to think Russia is faltering or losing  and then Russia crushes them with a massive surge or route that blindsided the enemy. It's their M.O. \nI mean think about it. We see countless videos of combat footage of drones taking out Russian advance groups, sea drones, strikes on Russian armor groups, even Sea drones taking out naval destroyers. Meanwhile Russia   now not only controls Crimea but most of the coastal areas and they got their land bridge connecting to Eastern occupied Ukraine regions, also towns and villages are completely wiped out and major cities are taking large strikes as well. So Russia basically controls the Black Sea and bottlenecks any energy or shipping networks I to Eurasia and the Mediterranean from those axis points. Yeah drone videos with hyped music is cool, but who's really winning on points here? \nIf you ignore the rhetoric from mainstream media you realize also that this conflict has been going on for over 10 years now. And if anything is said Russia has been gradually achieving every single one of their objectives in this invasion. \nCircling back to the question of Russia Advancement sustainability, didn't we hear Col. Vindman giving a briefing recently warning the west that Russia was not only amassing new and upgraded equipment and munitions, but also Russia could very well build another sizable overpowering army surge into Ukraine? I recall Vindman claiming possible troop number over 200k. \nCan anyone verify this? I think this would be a strong indicator to whether or not Russia is gonna be able to keep this invasion going just as much as the economics and public support aspects.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>When I read about the situation and see these signs of attrition the Russians are facing, i.e. &quot;meat&quot; and apc waves, rate of GDP spent rising cost of sanction based Petro monetary conversions etc, I&#39;m always thinking how many times have we seen this from Russia? It&#39;s like they wrote the book on getting their opponents to think Russia is faltering or losing  and then Russia crushes them with a massive surge or route that blindsided the enemy. It&#39;s their M.O. \nI mean think about it. We see countless videos of combat footage of drones taking out Russian advance groups, sea drones, strikes on Russian armor groups, even Sea drones taking out naval destroyers. Meanwhile Russia   now not only controls Crimea but most of the coastal areas and they got their land bridge connecting to Eastern occupied Ukraine regions, also towns and villages are completely wiped out and major cities are taking large strikes as well. So Russia basically controls the Black Sea and bottlenecks any energy or shipping networks I to Eurasia and the Mediterranean from those axis points. Yeah drone videos with hyped music is cool, but who&#39;s really winning on points here? \nIf you ignore the rhetoric from mainstream media you realize also that this conflict has been going on for over 10 years now. And if anything is said Russia has been gradually achieving every single one of their objectives in this invasion. \nCircling back to the question of Russia Advancement sustainability, didn&#39;t we hear Col. Vindman giving a briefing recently warning the west that Russia was not only amassing new and upgraded equipment and munitions, but also Russia could very well build another sizable overpowering army surge into Ukraine? I recall Vindman claiming possible troop number over 200k. \nCan anyone verify this? I think this would be a strong indicator to whether or not Russia is gonna be able to keep this invasion going just as much as the economics and public support aspects.</p>\n</div>",
