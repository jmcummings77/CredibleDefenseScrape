Which means it doesn't create an upstream reservoir, like what you see in pictures of the Hoover dam.\n\n> Might be worth noting that the Kakhovka reservoir was created when they built this particular dam, but it is not the hydro dam's structure itself (i.e. the spillway, the 500m concrete structure spanning the river) that creates the reservoir. It's the earthen embankments on either side of the spillway that actually dam the river's flow. So destroying the spillway isn't likely to cause significant flooding beyond potentially some hard-to-predict localized effects.

The majority of the river's span is crossed by the solid earthen embankments, which are definitely not going to be easily destroyed, especially at range. The rest is crossed by a solid concrete structure on top of 30 meter tall, solid concrete pylons spaced 20 meters apart.\n\n> So theoretically it's possible to destroy the spillway, but it probably can't even be seriously damaged without expending enormous amounts of munitions. You'd also need to take out multiple contiguous pylons to make it worthwhile, because otherwise the Russians could lay replacement spans quite easily. Meaning you'd have to do a hard thing that takes a large amount of very precisely delivered explosives, and then you'd have to do it multiple times for it to be really effective. It doesn't help that even if the whole structure were to collapse, the wreckage would probably still make reasonably solid ground for an assault bridge.\n\n> So the Ukrainians are blowing up the little access bridge instead.

The article does not state whether the tankers are Chinese or another country. It can be assumed that they are from a non-EU country and not from the US as they are being used to get around EU restrictions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You\u2019re fundamentally wrong on every one of your assumptions. Western tankers are still moving over 70% of Russian oil. There are no EU shipping restrictions in place yet, they\u2019re set to go in on Dec 5. Rotterdam is still receiving daily shipments of Russian oil. </p>\n\n<p>But more importantly, your entire premise is that 30 of the world\u2019s richest countries are talking about and working towards enforcing a plan that structurally can not work? Lol. And just to be clear, I\u2019ve also stated this numerous times: I actually am not in favor of a price cap. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>article states costs have risen due to having to switch to smaller tankers </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That in itself serves as a price cap.</p>\n</div>",

Which isn't the same as semi-active laser guidance, where a target is painted, and missile guides itself to the painted target. Rather the missile has receivers on the back of it and it stays with in the \"beam\" of the laser. Shorta-1 includes a laser receiver warning system that includes the incoming direction of the missile, upon detection of being painted the system is designed to automatically deploy smoke grenades and I'd assume inform the driver of the direction to move.\n\nWhether it can detect the laser used by Stuga-P, who knows.
