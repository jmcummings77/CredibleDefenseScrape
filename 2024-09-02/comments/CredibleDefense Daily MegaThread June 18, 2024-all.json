As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

It is easy to demand countries hit that target but it wouldn't mean anything if they did it by just blowing a load of money on useless shit. I agree we should spend more, but there should be a plan and there should be coordination. France could say they will provide strategic airlift, Poland does the massed armor, Canada provides ships and air forces etc...\n\nSaying a country should leave if they don't hit a target is not productive either.

        "body": "Today is exactly one month since the new mobilization law went into effect in Ukraine, and we can begin to discuss the effectiveness of the new legislation and its practical effects. There are some early reports that the number of new recruits over the past month has actually increased significantly. \n\nRoman Kostenko, secretary of the National Security, Defense and Intelligence Committee of the Verkhovna Rada, last week [stated](https://zn.ua/ukr/war/deputat-pro-tempi-mobilizatsiji-za-traven-nabrali-jak-za-piv-roku.html) that as many men were mobilized in May as in the previous 6 months (!). Current recruitment rates are reportedly at their [highest level](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2024/06/10/7460115/) since early 2023. \n\nLet\u2019s recall that in the past few months Syrsky's decision to send a few tens of thousands of rear personnel (including 5,000 servicemen of the Air Force) to the front, about which I had written extensively when the first rumors about this came out, allowed to buy precious time while waiting for the new law and to replenish the ranks of the brigades fighting in the hottest sectors.\n\n2,1 million Ukrainians [have updated](https://vechirniy.kyiv.ua/news/99528/) their data as required by the new law (the deadline for this is July 18). Of these, over 1,5 million via the \"Reserv+\" app - including over 200,000 women (those with medical/nursing degrees), as well as a few tens of thousands who uploaded their data from abroad. The rest uploaded their information physically through administrative service centers or Territorial Recruitment Centers.\n\nUnlike Russia, the Ukrainians don\u2019t release official figures on the pace of mobilization/recruitment. According to what I had read last year, about 30,000 men had been mobilized in January 2023; in the winter of 2022/23 Ukraine greatly expanded mobilization efforts to staff the very large number of brigades created in late 2022 and early 2023, while the number of volunteers had declined substantially compared to 2022. The TRC of Poltava Oblast had stated that in December 2023 300 men had been mobilized, which at the national level, if the pace was the same, would correspond to about 7/8 thousand men. We can also assume that during 2024 at the national level the pace had decreased. But taking Kostenko\u2019s statements as true, it\u2019s entirely possible that today we\u2019re back to the levels of January 2023. \n\nIn addition, the Deputy Minister of Defense, Natalia Kalmykova, [stated](https://tsn.ua/ato/yake-spivvidnoshennya-dobrovolciv-ta-mobilizovanih-v-zsu-u-minoboroni-ozvuchili-cifri-2598618.html) that 25% of the new recruits are volunteers. I assume it means those who showed up of their own choice, as many Ukrainian volunteers are formally classified as mobilized. Let me clarify this: those who are under 25 could join the UAF only by signing a 3-year or 5-year contract (with parental permission required for those under 21). Those who are 25 or older can either sign a contract or go to the TRC and ask to be mobilized, even if they are indeed volunteers. In this case they will serve until the end of martial law. Mobilized men who were summoned are called \"conscripts for a special period during mobilization\" in Ukrainian jargon. Volunteers often join a given brigade with which they have contacts and received a letter of recommendation (according to a [report](https://cepa.org/article/the-elite-ukrainian-brigade-everyone-wants-to-join/) from April, the 3rd Assault Brigade receives 900 applications per month - there is a waiting list to get in); those who volunteer without contacts are often sent to the TDF brigade from their region (the TDF is still staffed largely by volunteers and receives very few mobilized, having the lowest priority in receiving them by the way). The figure of volunteers should include the first convicts who have volunteered and signed a contract (several hundred as early as May).\n\nRecently a new rank [has been introduced](https://unn.ua/news/zakon-pro-posylennia-mobilizatsii-shcho-zminytsia-pislia-18-travnia-dlia-viiskovozoboviazanykh) in the UAF - \"recruit\u201d. It should be mentioned that in a part of the mobilized men (especially in the older ones) there are widespread physical shape issues or some health issues (minor ones, or they would be exempt).\n\nLet\u2019s recall that with the passage of the new law, numerous bonuses have been provided for those who sign a contract and for new recruits in general. After each year of service, the contract soldiers shall be entitled to a one-time bonus of 100 thousand Hryvnias. After 3 months of signing, they will have a 150 thousand Hryvnias voucher for the purchase of a vehicle. They will be entitled to a 50% compensation on the down payment of a mortgage and they and their family members won't have to pay any interest on current loans, except for real estate mortgage or loans for vehicle purchases. In addition, some local entities offer financial bonuses (within the limits of their small budgets), as the Lviv municipality does for its residents who sign a contract with the Air Assault Forces or the Marine Corps. In addition, there has recently been an increase in utility bills in Ukraine (electricity has increased by 80% since June 1); since March 1, rules have changed about the rent subsidy for internally displaced people (disbursed now only to categories such as the elderly and disabled), which may have made contract service in the UAF more attractive to thousands of men. \n\nIt\u2019s also reported that in the last few months many people who wanted to volunteer had been waiting to see what the new mobilization law looked like and whether bonuses were introduced for new contract soldiers.

The effectiveness of the new recruitment centers it\u2019s also mentioned - there are 25 of them at the moment, opened in major Ukrainian cities, where Ukrainians can look up vacancies in the various brigades and sign a contract directly with their representatives, bypassing much of the TRC\u2019s duties.\n\nIt should also be noted that the [possibility](https://tsn.ua/ukrayina/hto-mozhe-uklasti-kontrakt-iz-zsu-na-odin-rik-u-minoboroni-nazvali-umovi-2595693.html) of signing 1-year contracts for those under 25 was recently introduced, with release at the end of service (at least assuming the mobilization age will not be lowered further by next year).\n\nThe bonuses are not only for contract soldiers: the city of Kyiv allocates 30 thousand Hryvnias to newly mobilized residents from the last winter. As far as I have heard, mobilization in Kyiv has been ramped up already since the beginning of 2024, whereas until then it took place with considerably less intensity than in the rest of the country.\n\nFrom my analysis of Ukrainian social media, I found comments from relatives of men who have recently started training who claim that there are many other recruits with them; I also found comments from people saying that they and quite a lot of their own acquaintances recently received a subpoena for the first time.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Today is exactly one month since the new mobilization law went into effect in Ukraine, and we can begin to discuss the effectiveness of the new legislation and its practical effects. There are some early reports that the number of new recruits over the past month has actually increased significantly. </p>\n\n<p>Roman Kostenko, secretary of the National Security, Defense and Intelligence Committee of the Verkhovna Rada, last week <a href=\"https://zn.ua/ukr/war/deputat-pro-tempi-mobilizatsiji-za-traven-nabrali-jak-za-piv-roku.html\">stated</a> that as many men were mobilized in May as in the previous 6 months (!). Current recruitment rates are reportedly at their <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2024/06/10/7460115/\">highest level</a> since early 2023. </p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s recall that in the past few months Syrsky&#39;s decision to send a few tens of thousands of rear personnel (including 5,000 servicemen of the Air Force) to the front, about which I had written extensively when the first rumors about this came out, allowed to buy precious time while waiting for the new law and to replenish the ranks of the brigades fighting in the hottest sectors.</p>\n\n<p>2,1 million Ukrainians <a href=\"https://vechirniy.kyiv.ua/news/99528/\">have updated</a> their data as required by the new law (the deadline for this is July 18). Of these, over 1,5 million via the &quot;Reserv+&quot; app - including over 200,000 women (those with medical/nursing degrees), as well as a few tens of thousands who uploaded their data from abroad. The rest uploaded their information physically through administrative service centers or Territorial Recruitment Centers.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Russia, the Ukrainians don\u2019t release official figures on the pace of mobilization/recruitment. According to what I had read last year, about 30,000 men had been mobilized in January 2023; in the winter of 2022/23 Ukraine greatly expanded mobilization efforts to staff the very large number of brigades created in late 2022 and early 2023, while the number of volunteers had declined substantially compared to 2022. The TRC of Poltava Oblast had stated that in December 2023 300 men had been mobilized, which at the national level, if the pace was the same, would correspond to about 7/8 thousand men. We can also assume that during 2024 at the national level the pace had decreased. But taking Kostenko\u2019s statements as true, it\u2019s entirely possible that today we\u2019re back to the levels of January 2023. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, the Deputy Minister of Defense, Natalia Kalmykova, <a href=\"https://tsn.ua/ato/yake-spivvidnoshennya-dobrovolciv-ta-mobilizovanih-v-zsu-u-minoboroni-ozvuchili-cifri-2598618.html\">stated</a> that 25% of the new recruits are volunteers. I assume it means those who showed up of their own choice, as many Ukrainian volunteers are formally classified as mobilized. Let me clarify this: those who are under 25 could join the UAF only by signing a 3-year or 5-year contract (with parental permission required for those under 21). Those who are 25 or older can either sign a contract or go to the TRC and ask to be mobilized, even if they are indeed volunteers. In this case they will serve until the end of martial law. Mobilized men who were summoned are called &quot;conscripts for a special period during mobilization&quot; in Ukrainian jargon. Volunteers often join a given brigade with which they have contacts and received a letter of recommendation (according to a <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/the-elite-ukrainian-brigade-everyone-wants-to-join/\">report</a> from April, the 3rd Assault Brigade receives 900 applications per month - there is a waiting list to get in); those who volunteer without contacts are often sent to the TDF brigade from their region (the TDF is still staffed largely by volunteers and receives very few mobilized, having the lowest priority in receiving them by the way). The figure of volunteers should include the first convicts who have volunteered and signed a contract (several hundred as early as May).</p>\n\n<p>Recently a new rank <a href=\"https://unn.ua/news/zakon-pro-posylennia-mobilizatsii-shcho-zminytsia-pislia-18-travnia-dlia-viiskovozoboviazanykh\">has been introduced</a> in the UAF - &quot;recruit\u201d. It should be mentioned that in a part of the mobilized men (especially in the older ones) there are widespread physical shape issues or some health issues (minor ones, or they would be exempt).</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s recall that with the passage of the new law, numerous bonuses have been provided for those who sign a contract and for new recruits in general. After each year of service, the contract soldiers shall be entitled to a one-time bonus of 100 thousand Hryvnias. After 3 months of signing, they will have a 150 thousand Hryvnias voucher for the purchase of a vehicle. They will be entitled to a 50% compensation on the down payment of a mortgage and they and their family members won&#39;t have to pay any interest on current loans, except for real estate mortgage or loans for vehicle purchases. In addition, some local entities offer financial bonuses (within the limits of their small budgets), as the Lviv municipality does for its residents who sign a contract with the Air Assault Forces or the Marine Corps. In addition, there has recently been an increase in utility bills in Ukraine (electricity has increased by 80% since June 1); since March 1, rules have changed about the rent subsidy for internally displaced people (disbursed now only to categories such as the elderly and disabled), which may have made contract service in the UAF more attractive to thousands of men. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also reported that in the last few months many people who wanted to volunteer had been waiting to see what the new mobilization law looked like and whether bonuses were introduced for new contract soldiers.

            "body": "In addition, an expansion of several training centers (where newly mobilized men or volunteers are trained) has begun since early June. Roman Donik, an instructor in the 151st Training Center and a well-known personality on Ukrainian social media, stated that a massive expansion of the center has been approved by Syrsky and Pavliuk (commander of the Ground Forces), with the creation of new training branches from scratch and the need to recruit numerous trainers, specialists and clerks. \n\nhttps://t. me/romandonik/4303\n\nThis center was one of the TDF's training centers (like the 152nd) and came under the Ground Forces late last year, joining training centers as the 169th (where armored forces are also trained), the 184th, 190th, 197th and 239th; the Air Assault Forces have their own TC too (the 199th), as does the Marine Corps. Each of these TCs has specific tasks and trains men destined for a range of brigades, while other TCs send recruits to other brigades. As far as I have read, TRCs also complain about manpower shortages and call for an expansion of staffing to better perform their duties. Just like training centers, TRCs are largely staffed by veterans, much of whom are no longer fit for frontline service.\n\nLet\u2019s recall that there is still a, small, share of newly recruited men who have prior combat experience: ATO veterans who for some reason had not been called up until now or who choose to volunteer. Syrsky [had said](https://suspilne.media/716438-pro-mobilizaciu-500-tisac-ludej-narazi-ne-jdetsa-sirskij/) in March that 16% of the newly mobilized men had skipped the training phase in the Training Centers and came directly to their assigned brigade because they had military experience.\n\nAccording to a recent statement by People's Deputy Horbenko, the staffing requirement for this year is 100/110 thousand people. Ukraine's recruitment potential for the rest of 2024 is estimated to be at 120 thousand people - largely feasible if this new pace is maintained. It was clarified that the requirement expressed by Zaluzhny at the end of last year (450 to 500 thousand troops) took into account a new counteroffensive.\n\nDebates continue about the \"reservation\" system (by which a part or all of a company's workers can be exempted from mobilization). The controversial proposal to reform the system and allow reservations through the payment of 20 thousand Hryvnias per month per employee has become a [bill](https://itd.rada.gov.ua/billInfo/Bills/Card/44389); employers object to this proposal on the grounds that the required amount is equivalent to an average gross salary.\n\nNews had come out in recent weeks that 50% of policemen and workers of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (which includes firefighters and the likes) would be mobilized; after various discussions the number [has been greatly reduced](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-society/3872607-vid-mobilizacii-zabronovani-90-ratuvalnikiv-i-policejskih-klimenko.html) (possibly in light of the current increased pace of mobilization): only 10% shall be mobilized (so about 15,000 people), drawn from among men in the 25-59 age bracket. The policemen will be able to join the \"Lyut\" Brigade and other combat units of the National Police while the rescuers will be able to join the UAF, the National Guard or the Border Guards. \n\nLet\u2019s now list the most important points and critical issues. Ukraine has three priority steps in the recruitment process. As a minimum, recruitment must exceed the number of monthly irretrievable losses. It\u2019s not clear at all if this was the case during the worst months in terms of recruitment (early 2024). Secondly, existing brigades must be reconstituted at full strength. It\u2019s not at all uncommon to have battalions understaffed by 40%. Thirdly, Ukraine must also either create new brigades or expand existing brigades into divisions, with the goal of improving both troop density in several sectors and especially the possibility of rotation, which is critical for soldiers, both physically and psychologically. If the pace achivied during May is maintained and the effects of the new law continue to prove effective, the second and partly the third point can be satisfied as well. \n\nTraining continues to be an issue. On average this lasts 2 months, extendable up to 3 months for some specialties, but for some of the recruits it may last as little as 1 month. Unfortunately, the quality of both TCs and brigades can be very hit and miss. Too often I see reports on social media of Ukrainians being mobilized in one month and being KIA/MIA by the next. It often happens to the over 45/50s, who usually receive the worst training and are sent to more expendable roles in the worse units. \n\nThe 93rd Mechanized Brigade offers 1 month of additional training for newly arrived recruits; the 3rd Assault Brigade, the \"Azov\" and \"Khartiia\" Brigade of the National Guard, the 92nd Assault Brigade, the 68th Jager Brigade, the 110th Mech Brigade (and others) also offer additional training periods with their own instructors, but in the second/third-rate brigades or in the separate rifle battalions this is not the case and recruits are sent to the front line as soon as they arrive from the TC. Even in the latters the quality varies. I have heard good things about the 151st Training Center, but in some of the others the average quality of instructors is not high and they contain officers thrown out of front line service for incompetence etc, who are not always interested in providing great training to the recruits. \n\nThe luckiest are those who are sent abroad - usually it happens to the younger ones who sign a contract (as long as they don't have outstanding debts or don't have to pay alimony), but not only: for example, at least one company of the 455th Rifle Battalion of the 141st Infantry Brigade was trained in the UK. Others go to Germany, others (quite a lot, from what I read!) to Spain. In these cases, the training abroad + the training in Ukraine can last up to 3 months. This is the figure that was promised by Zaluzhny at the end of last year, and I think it should definitely be the norm for everyone. In addition, the partner countries should continue and expand the recruitment, as it\u2019s plausible that the training centers in Ukraine are close to capacity. In this regard, let's recall that France recently promised to train and equip an entire new brigade. Last part below.",

                "body": "Another very important issue is the shortage of officers and especially of good officers. Since February 2022 Ukraine has created thousands among new battalions and their companies, having then to find as many men to lead them. There are people who were majors of the Air Force and retired like 25 years ago who were mobilized and put in charge of rifle companies after a short course. There are programs to better prepare and promote deserving young officers, as well as programs turning experienced sergeants into junior officers, but the need is still very high and the biggest bottleneck is in the middle levels: from captains (company commanders) to colonels (brigade commanders) - perhaps in regards to majors (battalion commanders) the issue is at its worst. On this point the partners should help by training officers as well. In any case, this point should be at least partly improved by the release of 60% of the officers of the General Staff into combat units and intermediate command/control bodies. To give an example of a new case that had large backlash in Ukrainian social media: the former commander of the TRC of Rivne Oblast (Lt. Colonel Oleksandr Yarmoshevyc), who resigned in March after being caught kissing with two women in his office during his duty, [has just arrived](https://tsn.ua/exclusive/kazanova-rivnenskogo-tck-povernuvsya-z-frontu-i-otrimav-novu-posadu-2595345.html) in Uzhhorod in Transcarpathia, where he will be the commander of a new brigade being formed there and will organize the recruitment and the creation process. The issue of officer quality, in addition to the undetermined length of service, is one of the biggest obstacles preventing some Ukrainians from volunteering.\n\nUkraine is indeed forming new brigades; five new infantry brigades (155th to 159th) were formed in the Ground Forces in 2024; there has been a small expansion of the National Guard; a detachment of Border Guards has been reformed into a brigade (\u201cHart\u201d). I hope that the new infantry brigades will have a capable and efficient structure and are not just binders of separate rifle battalion, which is a type of unit that has shown criticalities and has been widely criticized by Ukrainians. Moreover, it would be better to focus on creating divisions/corps rather than increasing the number of brigades, all things being equal; I have written about this point and will return to it another time in the future.\n\nAccording to Kostenko\u2019s report, there are no problems in dressing and in the individual equipment of the new recruits - I guess thanks to the support of foreign partners. Even just dressing a soldier between uniform, helmet, bulletproof vest, radio, medical kit, etc. is very expensive. In some training centers there are serious shortages of assault rifles and ammunition - this issue is [well documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1d72ohc/comment/l6wzcxi/) by Western press - with recruits being able to fire too few rounds and often having to train with 7,62mm caliber assault rifles instead of the 5,45mm assault rifles that are generally used at the front.\n\nAs for heavy equipment\u2026 the 150th Mechanized Brigade (a new brigade, created in late 2023) was seen with T-64BVs and BMP-2s. Moreover, the 110th Mechanized Brigade received a tank unit for the first time, equipped with the T-64BVs, during its reconstitution in the past months. T-64BVs seem almost endless - probably the actual number of T-64BVs in Ukrainian depots was underestimated by international observers. Updated T-72EAs will continue to arrive in the future from Czechia (in addition to BMP-2s). Poland lately should have sent additional PT-91s (and BWP-1s). \n\nHowever, it\u2019s possible that there will be some shortage of tanks in the future, particularly of good tanks - in this sense I hope that the US will decide to send more Abrams (and I\u2019d also look at the Australian M1A1s); at the moment among the Western tanks that will continue to arrive in Ukraine in the future there is only the Leopard 2A4, to my knowledge - barring the Leopard 1A5, a large number of which have yet to arrive, which could form a significant part of the Ukrainian armored component in the future, despite limitations in terms of armor and armament (notably the lack of HE rounds - partially offset by HESH and Canister rounds). Perhaps in the future partners could look for T-72s around the world (I'm thinking of Morocco, primarily, which had already contributed in the past), but also Cypriot T-80Us and Pakistani T-80UDs (Ukrainian-made!). Who knows if batches of M60A3s will ever arrive in the future.\n\nAs for IFVs, a large number of new Bradleys, other batches of Marders are to arrive; in addition, the UAF still holds many Strykers in the rear. Newly produced CV90s and KF41s will also arrive in the future; I wonder if in case of future tank shortages there might be a possibility of equipping a part of the last two vehicles with a 120mm weapon. \n\nAs for APCs, hundreds of M113s and their variants are on their way from partner countries. This is very good news for the mechanization of the UAF. In addition to the American M117s, French VABs etc; additional MRAPs and IMVs will arrive too, which are also very useful, especially the formers. Moreover, the Ukrainians are continuing to put 30mm turrets on the hull of their MT-LBs, which is a very interesting solution.\n\nAs for artillery, 155mm guns will be the most important. Newly produced SPHs from Germany and France will be of great help, and Ukrainian domestic production is very significant in this field (10 2S22 Bohdanas per month, with plans to begin production of the towed version). The actual extent of the new shipment of M777s and/or M109s from the US is yet to be assessed. New M109s should also arrive from several other partners. And let\u2019s also remember the Greek M114s. 105mm howitzers are in abundance compared to the volumes of fire (which have actually greatly improved after the arrival of shells from the US). Similar discourse for 122mm and 152mm howitzers - at the moment there seems to be no shortage in the Ukrainian ranks and in the future former Warsaw Pact countries and Finland could supply the UAF with them (let\u2019s recall recent shipments of 2S1 Gvozdika from Bulgaria).

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Another very important issue is the shortage of officers and especially of good officers. Since February 2022 Ukraine has created thousands among new battalions and their companies, having then to find as many men to lead them. There are people who were majors of the Air Force and retired like 25 years ago who were mobilized and put in charge of rifle companies after a short course. There are programs to better prepare and promote deserving young officers, as well as programs turning experienced sergeants into junior officers, but the need is still very high and the biggest bottleneck is in the middle levels: from captains (company commanders) to colonels (brigade commanders) - perhaps in regards to majors (battalion commanders) the issue is at its worst. On this point the partners should help by training officers as well. In any case, this point should be at least partly improved by the release of 60% of the officers of the General Staff into combat units and intermediate command/control bodies. To give an example of a new case that had large backlash in Ukrainian social media: the former commander of the TRC of Rivne Oblast (Lt. Colonel Oleksandr Yarmoshevyc), who resigned in March after being caught kissing with two women in his office during his duty, <a href=\"https://tsn.ua/exclusive/kazanova-rivnenskogo-tck-povernuvsya-z-frontu-i-otrimav-novu-posadu-2595345.html\">has just arrived</a> in Uzhhorod in Transcarpathia, where he will be the commander of a new brigade being formed there and will organize the recruitment and the creation process. The issue of officer quality, in addition to the undetermined length of service, is one of the biggest obstacles preventing some Ukrainians from volunteering.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is indeed forming new brigades; five new infantry brigades (155th to 159th) were formed in the Ground Forces in 2024; there has been a small expansion of the National Guard; a detachment of Border Guards has been reformed into a brigade (\u201cHart\u201d). I hope that the new infantry brigades will have a capable and efficient structure and are not just binders of separate rifle battalion, which is a type of unit that has shown criticalities and has been widely criticized by Ukrainians. Moreover, it would be better to focus on creating divisions/corps rather than increasing the number of brigades, all things being equal; I have written about this point and will return to it another time in the future.</p>\n\n<p>According to Kostenko\u2019s report, there are no problems in dressing and in the individual equipment of the new recruits - I guess thanks to the support of foreign partners. Even just dressing a soldier between uniform, helmet, bulletproof vest, radio, medical kit, etc. is very expensive. In some training centers there are serious shortages of assault rifles and ammunition - this issue is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1d72ohc/comment/l6wzcxi/\">well documented</a> by Western press - with recruits being able to fire too few rounds and often having to train with 7,62mm caliber assault rifles instead of the 5,45mm assault rifles that are generally used at the front.</p>\n\n<p>As for heavy equipment\u2026 the 150th Mechanized Brigade (a new brigade, created in late 2023) was seen with T-64BVs and BMP-2s. Moreover, the 110th Mechanized Brigade received a tank unit for the first time, equipped with the T-64BVs, during its reconstitution in the past months. T-64BVs seem almost endless - probably the actual number of T-64BVs in Ukrainian depots was underestimated by international observers. Updated T-72EAs will continue to arrive in the future from Czechia (in addition to BMP-2s). Poland lately should have sent additional PT-91s (and BWP-1s). </p>\n\n<p>However, it\u2019s possible that there will be some shortage of tanks in the future, particularly of good tanks - in this sense I hope that the US will decide to send more Abrams (and I\u2019d also look at the Australian M1A1s); at the moment among the Western tanks that will continue to arrive in Ukraine in the future there is only the Leopard 2A4, to my knowledge - barring the Leopard 1A5, a large number of which have yet to arrive, which could form a significant part of the Ukrainian armored component in the future, despite limitations in terms of armor and armament (notably the lack of HE rounds - partially offset by HESH and Canister rounds). Perhaps in the future partners could look for T-72s around the world (I&#39;m thinking of Morocco, primarily, which had already contributed in the past), but also Cypriot T-80Us and Pakistani T-80UDs (Ukrainian-made!). Who knows if batches of M60A3s will ever arrive in the future.</p>\n\n<p>As for IFVs, a large number of new Bradleys, other batches of Marders are to arrive; in addition, the UAF still holds many Strykers in the rear. Newly produced CV90s and KF41s will also arrive in the future; I wonder if in case of future tank shortages there might be a possibility of equipping a part of the last two vehicles with a 120mm weapon. </p>\n\n<p>As for APCs, hundreds of M113s and their variants are on their way from partner countries. This is very good news for the mechanization of the UAF. In addition to the American M117s, French VABs etc; additional MRAPs and IMVs will arrive too, which are also very useful, especially the formers. Moreover, the Ukrainians are continuing to put 30mm turrets on the hull of their MT-LBs, which is a very interesting solution.</p>\n\n<p>As for artillery, 155mm guns will be the most important. Newly produced SPHs from Germany and France will be of great help, and Ukrainian domestic production is very significant in this field (10 2S22 Bohdanas per month, with plans to begin production of the towed version). The actual extent of the new shipment of M777s and/or M109s from the US is yet to be assessed. New M109s should also arrive from several other partners. And let\u2019s also remember the Greek M114s. 105mm howitzers are in abundance compared to the volumes of fire (which have actually greatly improved after the arrival of shells from the US). Similar discourse for 122mm and 152mm howitzers - at the moment there seems to be no shortage in the Ukrainian ranks and in the future former Warsaw Pact countries and Finland could supply the UAF with them (let\u2019s recall recent shipments of 2S1 Gvozdika from Bulgaria). As for mortars, Ukraine produces 100 mortars per month (overwhelmingly 82mm ones), and the main issue is, of course, rounds. </p>\n\n<p>Now that the first batches from the Czech initiative are arriving, there are decent volumes from the EU, and large arrivals from the US have resumed, the situation for Ukrainian artillery has significantly improved. This Ukrainian officer reports that after supplying artillery brigades with shells, now the situation is also improving for mechanized etc. brigades.

Ukraine seems like a big country, but it's quite densely packed with lots of horizontal connections.
