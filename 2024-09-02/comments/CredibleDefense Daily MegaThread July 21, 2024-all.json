The (sane) reasons I saw boiled down to something like this:\n\na) Biden's voter ceiling is any other (viable) replacement candidate's floor\n\nb) Large portions of the electorate are actually on their knees praying for any viable candidate that isn't Trump or Biden. Emphasis on any.\n\nc) Biden winning is a statistical impossibility\n\nAnd I disagree with all of them to some degree.\n\nPoint a stems from the misconception that all of Biden's 2020 coalition were just people who wanted to beat Trump, not people excited about Biden.  But this is false - while perhaps not Obama, plenty of voters (including voters that Trump is strong with, like union lugs) were uniquely motivated by Biden to turn out, and may have otherwise stayed home, which given the tight margins, would have been a disaster.\n\nPeople point out that at least half of dems (sometimes more or less depending on the poll) say they want Biden out.  That leaves another half that doesn't.  The response is the assumption \"oh all of those voters will clearly fall in line and vote for whoever replaces Biden\".  And I'm not sure I'm buying that, especially since Harris differs significantly from Biden.\n\nb is a common refrain in various communities, not just liberal ones but also centrist ones.

The (sane) reasons I saw boiled down to something like this:</p>\n\n<p>a) Biden&#39;s voter ceiling is any other (viable) replacement candidate&#39;s floor</p>\n\n<p>b) Large portions of the electorate are actually on their knees praying for any viable candidate that isn&#39;t Trump or Biden. Emphasis on any.</p>\n\n<p>c) Biden winning is a statistical impossibility</p>\n\n<p>And I disagree with all of them to some degree.</p>\n\n<p>Point a stems from the misconception that all of Biden&#39;s 2020 coalition were just people who wanted to beat Trump, not people excited about Biden.  But this is false - while perhaps not Obama, plenty of voters (including voters that Trump is strong with, like union lugs) were uniquely motivated by Biden to turn out, and may have otherwise stayed home, which given the tight margins, would have been a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>People point out that at least half of dems (sometimes more or less depending on the poll) say they want Biden out.

Second, you can&#39;t reject all GOPers as a juror out of hand.  There is a limited number as to how many prospective juror you can just reject without a cause - since you are not allowed to reject someone for their political affiliation - after which unless you can find something, he or she will be in the jury.  Even in the bluest of the blue and reddest of the red areas - lets say some area with only 10% opposite political party - will have 72% chance of a least one out of 12 jurors being the other party by probability.  AND you still have to convince even &quot;your&quot; political party people that this person committed a felony.  That&#39;s a tall order.</p>\n</div>",

This figure is mostly conscripts and professional soldiers who have been sent to the front line, but also includes Russians who have left the country due to the war, and combat losses. I will use this figure as a reference point.\n\nIt is widely reported that in 1969, at the height of the Vietnam War, there were some 550,000 Americans committed. The highest estimate I see for men emigrating to avoid the draft over the entire period is [100,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion_in_the_Vietnam_War). The total fatal casualty count in Vietnam was 58,220 - this figure is less than the *latest confirmed minimum count* of Russian deaths by Mediazona (59,725). All of this is from a reference point of the US having a population of ~200 million versus Russia's current population of ~144 million who skew much older now.\n\n---\n\nSo by every metric, Russia is *affected* more so in 2.5 years than the US was over 8 years. Though by many accounts it still feels relatively normal. As has been pointed out already, mobilization has only occurred once. So they have been able to keep up since then with volunteers; mostly from poor regions who have a new opportunity to make **a lot of money** from this (recently a [sign up bonus of ~$20,000](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-will-pay-19250-new-soldiers-fight-ukraine-211889) was announced).

I\u2019ve harped a lot on the Russian armor shortage, and it clearly affects offensive operations. A very rough timeline was that at the start of the invasion, Russia idealized sweeping combined arms warfare and miles of armored columns sweeping through Ukraine, which then pivoted to mechanized attacks with IFV\u2019s and BMP\u2019s later into 2022 and start of 2023, and by the start of Avdiivka, the proliferation of small unarmored assault groups, and motorcycle attacks in recent days.

They\u2019re usually spotted much later than large tanks and IFV\u2019s, and much harder to hit from a distance. It allows that familiar Russian tactic of smaller teams assembling at a common point to launch a larger attack, so even if a few inevitably get picked off, it probably produces fewer losses than advancing on foot. Do the Russians *want* to do this? Probably not. But I think it\u2019s still as solid an adaptation that one could make.

This is so that the guy advancing will take fire from an unexpected direction to his sides. Also, the only people who can spot and fire on MG position is the people getting murdered by it.

Grenadiers take care of the dead spaces.\n\nAnd what are the other tasks that need doing? Frontline troops shouldn't need to cook. That said, the tiring part isn't the watch. It's boring and they can fall asleep or doze off. The tiring part is to improve the fighting position. Plant firing stakes, sector sketch, measure the engaging distance, discuss firing and engagement plan with leaders. Dig deeper, add overhead cover, improve camouflage.

As well as the usual antipersonnel types they also supply claymore-type directional fragmentation the ever-popular anti-armor bombs with shaped-charge warheads, plus high-blast thermobaric munitions for destroying bunkers and buildings, newer explosively-formed penetrators capable of knocking out light armor from a distance, and now high-temperature thermite bombs for demolition jobs. Their designs are constantly refined and modified in response to feedback from the field,</p>\n\n<p>The Russian approach appears to be \u201cthis is what we make, take it or leave it.\u201d It has taken two years to get their first drone bombs produced. According to the document from General Staff, other mass-produced drone bombs including anti-tank and incendiary types are being tested but not yet in serial production.</p>\n\n<p>While the first OFSPs are now arriving, Russian forces still use a wide range of home-made devices of varying sophistication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
