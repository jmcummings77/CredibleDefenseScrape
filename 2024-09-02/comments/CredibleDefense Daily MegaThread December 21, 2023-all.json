The ships are not supposed to operate independently, and are designed to be extremely light on crew, with possibly full automation in the future. It seems like a very interesting method of expanding firepower for the existing modern frigates that the Navy already has. The project might be a taste of the future to come, these would be mostly autonomous and expandable munition ships that can link with an crewed and better protected mothership type controller.\n\n\nThis concept definitely also rhymes with the use of autonomous systems that the Dutch and Belgium navies are also implementing in their new Mine Hunter ships, of which 12 (6 for each Navy) are being commissioned, [and have started production already.](https://www.navaltoday.com/2023/03/29/first-minehunter-of-belgian-dutch-rmcm-program-hits-the-water/) As a sidenote, once these new ships are commissioned two of the old Dutch minehunters are already earmarked to be send to Ukraine in 2025.\n\nIn addition, the Navy has also finished the design studies for their new ASW frigates. This is also in cooperation with Belgium, [and the building contracts are being signed as we speak.](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2023/04/dutch-navys-asw-frigates-to-enter-service-in-2029/) there was previously some doubts about this ship and the associated costs, but Russia's invasion has loosened the purse strings, and things are moving forward quickly.\n\nLastly, there has been little news yet, but I personally expect official news on the replacement of the Dutch diesel submarines either next year, or the year after that, these are a little more complicated, as the Netherlands has not designed or build submarines in a long time, but the capabilities that the old submarines give are very important to the military, I am willing to bet the 4 existing boats will be replaced 1:1. But will probably be build in cooperation with either France, Germany or Sweden.\n\n\nOnce all these programs wrap up the Navy will be bigger then when it started, and have no combat ships anymore from before the year 2000. There are still problems to solve, for example it is dealing with personal shortages, but every new replacement ship will require less crew then its predecessors did, this alone will be a big help on that front. I think it is safe to say at least the Netherlands is taking its rearmament seriously, and I think we will see some of the bigger Naval powers pay attention to these (especially the autonomous missile boat) ideas.",

You would never know if you're fighting a MIM-23 Hawk or a MIM-104 Patriot, an IRIS-T or an old KUB or worse an S-125. That's a huge qualitative and generational difference between AD systems and Ukraine can increasingly move them around to open up opportunities such as this.  \n\n\nWorth noting that Ukrainians don't have to keep the battery hot or even be reliant upon their own ISR to determine incoming threats, which would leave them open to more vulnerabilities in terms of radar detection and mobility/time/interception issues. They can turn their radars on at the exact right moment or even keep them off whilst having far more knowledge than just Ukrainian sources alone could provide regarding the risk or disposition of incoming Russian strikes.  \n\n\nLuckily for Ukraine, they have under the table access to all manner of western systems and intelligence which has actively helped to shape their AD in particular since the start of the war. We've greatly enhanced their capabilities with donated equipment as well as just simple intelligence. Ukraine has the advantage of being able to send large portions of its network dark at a moments notice. This has consequences of course, but it has also been of benefit, allowing them to preserve a huge portion of their air defense network despite incredible pressure.   \n\n\nWhilst not explicit, Ukraine has likely had advance warning on practically speaking every aerial launch, they know when they're launched, when they're inbound, what aircraft type they are as well as sometimes what their payload likely or definitely is. This has greatly helped maximize Ukrainian air defenses, despite some of their many limitations earlier on in the war.  \n\n\nThis has become more obvious as Ukrainian AD shuts down long before any Su27's arrive after they take off from Crimea. This is largely done because the Su27's mostly carry Russia's KH-31P/PK anti-radiation missiles. They clearly have advanced warning of the aircraft type and the specific payload. It's widely considered a contributing factor for the strike against the vessel last month. Odessa's AD went dark based on intelligence of an incoming ARM strike, leaving the KH-31P to lock on to the nearest available emissions, which instead of being the radar of a missile battery was the radar from a civilian vessel making its way into port.   \n\n\nIt's easy to simplify this to a Russia vs Ukrainian AD equation and be baffled at Russia's relative lack of progress against a massive qualitative gap. To be clear Russia still is batting below average and it's lack of integrated SEAD operations continue to be a huge detriment. That being said it's a bit more complicated than that. The VKS not only have to contend with the Ukrainian air force, which itself isn't entirely out of the equation although is heavily suppressed, but they also have to contend with an air defence system that is largely experienced, varied, of significant depth and supplied with intelligence from an ISR network several times larger and more sophisticated than Ukraine or even Russia posses or have the means to operate.   \n\n\nThere's a reason we've had drones and other intelligence assets strafing the Black Sea for the better part of two years, that's not just a theatrical show and our intelligence assets include satellites and traditional intelligence sources as well. It's worthwhile noting these in any VKS/Russia vs Ukrainian AD conversation as it's a contributing factor regarding Ukrainian resiliency.",

One of the ships then acts as the area air warfare commander (AAWC). The AAWC ship coordinates the compilation of a Recognised Air Picture (RAP) across all ships and then allocates weapons accordingly when a threat is detected.

The classic convoy model of WWII can be discounted. There isn\u2019t space and there aren\u2019t enough ships. Operation Earnest Will of the late 80s in the Gulf was similar in terms of the threat but the number of ships that needed protecting was fewer. Operation Desert Shield in the early 90s had ships checking in at waypoints to be picked up by escorts and also saw merchant ships starting to embark their own missile defence systems, something that carried over to Operation Guardian Mariner in 2003. The\u00a0anti-piracy efforts of the late noughties and early teens\u00a0in the Gulf of Aden were over a larger area but more ships were available and the threat was much less sophisticated than what we have seen so far from the Houthis.\u00a0\n\n>This mix of threats in a confined space isn\u2019t unprecedented although the amount of ships that need protecting and the speed of attacking missiles may be.\u00a0\n\n>My money is on a hybrid solution that sees some ships in boxes up the eastern channel and some with a roving commission to attach themselves to ships deemed to be of high importance and to intercept piracy attempts.\u00a0\n\n>Aircraft will have a vital role in all of this, both in terms of contributing to the air picture but also for shooting down drones and engaging pirates. The surface warships have their own helicopters, but the US carrier Dwight D Eisenhower \u2013 Ike, now just to the south of the Bab el Mandeb in the Gulf of Aden \u2013 will bring hugely greater capability. However the US will not tie up a carrier on a task like this for the long term, so the surface warships will need to be able to do the job on their own.\n\n>In maritime terms the bottom of the Red Sea is small. But if you measure the distance from the southern to the northernmost attacks (so far) you are looking at 300 nautical miles. If you give each warship an ambitious 30 mile long box to protect, then you need ten ships for the missile/drone defence task alone. Some missiles carried by the various ships can theoretically cover much greater areas than this, but if a warship cannot detect a drone or a missile it cannot shoot at it: and a sea-skimming aircraft is below the horizon and thus unseen if it is at any great distance. There will also be ships in the task force which only have shorter-ranging missiles, so ten ships for the drone-and-missile barrier is a reasonable assumption.\n\n>Of course if you have ten ships on line you need more assigned to the force because they will need to refuel periodically, and at the current rate of missile expenditure, rearm as well. Then you add the roving ships for the piracy task and you quickly run out of ships. So you either make the boxes larger and therefore the defence more porous, or you protect a smaller area.

And bringing the funds home to Russia would have been another tipoff that an invasion was imminent, at a time Mr. Putin was vigorously denying American and British charges that he was preparing for military action.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Proponents of seizing Russia\u2019s assets, such as Mr. Zelikow and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, have argued that nations that hold Russian assets are entitled to cancel their obligations to Russia and apply those assets to what Russia owes for its breach of international law under the so-called international law of state countermeasures. They note that after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, $50 billion of Iraqi funds were seized and transferred through the United Nations to compensate victims in Iraq and other countries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The old proposal of using Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine&#39;s continued sovereignty is gaining steam. Interestingly, there is precedent from the Gulf War for such a move. There are various ideas of how to actually spend the money, and if Russia should have a chance to get it back in the future.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Eh, it\u2019s debatable. Certainly the blockade didn\u2019t help, but Germany was still able to wage a full scale, industrial war against the Allies for over 4 years, and even then only surrendered because of a political crisis within it, not a military defeat. They were still fighting in Belgium and France at the time of the Armistice and the Allies had taken massive casualties breaking through a few sections of the Hindenburg Line. Arguably the greater reason was that the Austrian and German army high commands made the decision after Brest-Litovsk to hoard the grain and oil production of Ukraine and Romania for themselves and transferred very little back to the civilians, even if that meant a lot of stuff went unused/wasted. But that has a lot to do with the specific military-political culture that existed in Vienna and Berlin at the time. Nazi Germany survived much longer under a more stringent blockade, even while getting its cities bombed to dust by the Allies, and fighting on multiple continents. \n\nI think in any serious conflict any blockade of China would have far less of an impact than people think. First off, China could very easily reduce civilian consumption of oil by implementing work from home, public transportation, and electrification initiatives. The military wouldn\u2019t need that much oil compared to a peacetime civilian economy, especially if the war is fought close to China\u2019s shores, and between Chinas domestic production, coal liquefaction, petroleum reserves, and pipelines from Russia they will probably have enough to maintain military operations around Taiwan and the SCS. As for food, China produces enough to meet its own caloric needs, and has Russia, Mongolia, and others to trade with. Pakistan could also act as a neutral middleman to get around export bans/blockades. The same is true of raw materials.\n\nBut a lot of this is kind of a moot point because the legal circumstances around blockades have changed a lot since WW1. Nowadays things like total blockades run dangerously close to war crimes like collective punishment, which will politically hurt any country trying to impose them. That matters especially when the country needs to maintain a network of alliances with third parties to maintain its bases and war effort, and those countries might not want to be seen participating in war crimes or come under UN sanction. And if your blockade isn\u2019t total, then it\u2019s not much of a blockade then is it? \n\nPlus, on the flip side a US blockade of China would hurt us a lot, too. Not just because it would take ships away to enforce the blockade that would otherwise be available to fight, but because it would mean a major blow to our own economy. We rely on China for a lot, from ferrous metals to precision electronics to pharmaceuticals to processed foods. A lot of US companies are also heavily invested in China and would be at risk of losing all of those investments during a blockade/war. Then there\u2019s the headache it would cause with shipping bottlenecks and higher insurance rates. Basically it would be a race to the bottom as we both begin to suffer from inflation, supply shortages, supply chain problems, and financial crises. Given the debt load the US already has, and if we take China out as a purchaser of US debt through war/a blockade, I don\u2019t see how the US will come out of any conflict without a major stagflationary/inflationary crisis on the other end. And that\u2019s definitely going to be something going through politicians minds when they think up the idea of a blockade.",

As for food, China produces enough to meet its own caloric needs, and has Russia, Mongolia, and others to trade with. Pakistan could also act as a neutral middleman to get around export bans/blockades. The same is true of raw materials.</p>\n\n<p>But a lot of this is kind of a moot point because the legal circumstances around blockades have changed a lot since WW1. Nowadays things like total blockades run dangerously close to war crimes like collective punishment, which will politically hurt any country trying to impose them. That matters especially when the country needs to maintain a network of alliances with third parties to maintain its bases and war effort, and those countries might not want to be seen participating in war crimes or come under UN sanction. And if your blockade isn\u2019t total, then it\u2019s not much of a blockade then is it? </p>\n\n<p>Plus, on the flip side a US blockade of China would hurt us a lot, too. Not just because it would take ships away to enforce the blockade that would otherwise be available to fight, but because it would mean a major blow to our own economy. We rely on China for a lot, from ferrous metals to precision electronics to pharmaceuticals to processed foods. A lot of US companies are also heavily invested in China and would be at risk of losing all of those investments during a blockade/war. Then there\u2019s the headache it would cause with shipping bottlenecks and higher insurance rates. Basically it would be a race to the bottom as we both begin to suffer from inflation, supply shortages, supply chain problems, and financial crises. Given the debt load the US already has, and if we take China out as a purchaser of US debt through war/a blockade, I don\u2019t see how the US will come out of any conflict without a major stagflationary/inflationary crisis on the other end. And that\u2019s definitely going to be something going through politicians minds when they think up the idea of a blockade.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine seems to be suffering from a massive manpower shortage at the moment, not a lack of equipment.\n\nIf the Ukrainians ever want to go on the offensive again and focus on mechanized assaults, which are needed to do anything more than clearing one treeline at a time with a squad of infantry, it'll need to solve a number of tactical defensive problems. One of them requires breaching extended and complex anti-tank minefields.\n\nOn top of that they need an overwhelming abundance of artillery ammo to outshoot the Russians, they need to dominate Russia with FPV drone usage, they need better EW systems, they need more SHORAD and medium range air defenses along the front lines to protect their assault brigades from fixed and rotary wing air attack, and they need to train every assault brigade ESPECIALLY their officers on how to conduct offensive operations properly.\n\n>But ok,  let\u2019s say they have the people. What amount of mine removal  equipment needs to be provided to neutralize enough of them to allow a Ukrainian advance? \n\nEvery attempt at a single lane is supposed to have at least one or two engineer platoons, depending on the situation. Considering the Russian defenses, that means two platoons minimum, likely three or four even, per lane.\n\nAnd EVERY brigade sector needs at least one lane to get through every minefield, of which there are multiple in every tactical defensive belt, with multiple tactical defensive belts combined for the overall operational defensive line. \n\nAssuming they can get enough trained sappers, they need a redundancy of actual specialized mine clearing vehicles, especially more MICLIC vehicles and trailers, as well as those that are essentially tanks with elaborate plows and rollers built in. \n\nMICLIC are supposed to do most of the work to create a cleared lane, the plows and rollers are supposed to go over them next to verify they're clear, called proofing, done primarily by dedicated engineering vehicles but needs to be done by the lead vehicle in every tank and mech infantry platoon the assault force. \n\nBecause the Russians can disperse more mines using MLRS, it means follow on forces also need plows and mines. The minimum is one per platoon, so one every three vehicles, but they've not had that. Same goes for rollers too. More realistically every AFV, especially tanks, needs at least a mine plow to proof lanes. \n\nDue to burying two or even three AT mines in a single hole, or modern directional AT mines, and that modern mines aren't as vulnerable to the shock effects of MICLIC as those from the 40s when the concept was created, all the dedicated engineering vehicles and many of the assault tanks with rollers or plows are going to strike mines and lose them. Traditionally, they're good for 1-3 hits before at least the roller-mine is damaged beyond use, but with the Russian TTPs, now it's commonly a single hit, and even then the vehicle itself, the whole thing, is out of commission. Hence the need for redundancy built into the breaching force. \n\nIf they lose a critical engineering vehicle, it needs to be replaced instantly by another vehicle in the element. Otherwise that force is no longer moving forward. While they're stuck in a minefield and not going anywhere for a while, within direct observation of the enemy front lines, and likely under drone observation too. So they're going to get walloped with arty, FPV drones, and ATGMs. Which means they can either retreat with their vehicles, or if the mine threat is bad enough, and potentially the trail vehicles are disabled too, everyone is dismounting and running away to abandon their vehicles.\n\nWhenever the Russians or Ukrainians attempt mechanized combined arms breaches, they almost never start out with enough engineering equipment to even get through a simple Soviet doctrinal minefield or defense, when in reality they are often attacking some of the most highly defended areas in the country. \n\nSo assuming they keep choosing hotly defended areas, and surprise might not always be possible, one thing they do need to make rapid advances needed for bold and audacious strategic goals is to get lots more engineering equipment.\n\nThe plus side, it doesn't take some super advanced tank production plant in Ohio to make this stuff. Mines and plows are actually pretty simple to make with welding equipment and scrap metal and bit of hydrologic know how. MICLIC was only ever a fire hose stuffed with plastic explosives fired by a rocket used by modern navies for refueling operations.

These are things that Ukraine can actually make on their own if their govt is capable of giving money out to other Ukrainian businesses without expecting corruption to impair it.</p>\n</div>",

Then they move forward with plows and rollers to clear the lane. Then they advance as far as they've cleared, fire the next one. Then proof that lane. But then that MICLIC is out of ammo, so another needs to be brought forward, and repeat the entire process. \n\nBut MICLIC aren't going to detonate/disable every mine. And doing the proofing, numerous armored engineering vehicles will be disabled and destroyed.

And another after that. And another after that. \n\nBut the part nobody is really talking about, is that these situations likely wouldn't happen if the US was fighting Russia. First, we'd have torn them apart in the first phase of the war well beyond what attrition the UAF caused them. Second, when the Russians spent over half a year digging in, we'd have been targeting their engineers the entire time, because they're easy targets to hit and taking them out is actually the best way to get through obstacles, kill the engineers before they can build it. We'd also have done a much better job looking for weak points. Or creating them through fires. And our political leadership probably wouldn't have made a point to tell the enemy exactly where we are attacking, giving them the impetus to build those defenses in the first place. In every previous war we've fought that involved massive breaching operations or other complex operations involving stealth, we've practiced good OPSEC and had a deception plan. The UAF didn't. Most of the time the Russians don't either, they are blatantly obvious where they attack, their political leaders announce it first and then they mass forces in a blatant manner and then attack pretty much right where it was obvious they were going to attack, which just so happens to be one of the most hotly defended sectors in the entire country. \n\nI wont say the US wouldn't screw up enough to have the same thing happen.

It included major protectionist shifts like US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a trade war with China. </p>\n\n<p>Biden\u2019s trade policy is more sophisticated and less controversial but does not reverse the core elements of \u2018America First.\u2019 His industrial flagship initiatives, like the CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act  include generous subsidy schemes to companies who manufacture in the US or build infrastructure using US materials. These measures are perceived by the rest of the developed world as incentives for their local multinational companies to relocate part of their production in the US in order to take advantage of these subsidies. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why would you think the world would realistically be better off without the USA hegemony?

            "body": "To be clear not a knock on you u/Tricky-Astronaut, thank you for linking it as there are some interesting details in here and it's worthy of discussion! So feel free to ignore this, it's going to be a bit of a ranting mess as this article has irked me in more than a few ways.\n\nI really don't like this overly editorial narrative style. This reads like a biographical front page seller about \"Putin's chief spy\" based on details from Patrushev's wikipedia page and a handful of previous stories rather than an actual report tying him to the act. The details are murky at best and yet I'm seeing this story get pushed far and wide by affiliates and paid media based on what can best be described as twice removed hearsay.\n\nFor a start we've got:  \n\n\n>None of that was true.  \n  \n>  \n>Hours after the incident, a European involved in intelligence gathering who maintained a backchannel of communication with the Kremlin and saw news of the crash asked an official there what had happened.  \n  \n>  \n>\u201cHe had to be removed,\u201d the Kremlin official responded without hesitation.\n\nJust to be clear, I highly doubt that an unexploded hand grenade of all things is what took down that jet, it was a laughable explanation then as it is now, almost reads like the premise of a kids cartoon, like Prigozhin just had an ACME crate lying in the back with a handful of grenades rolling around in it...If I were a betting man I'd say that some level of Russian government involvement, direct or otherwise is almost guaranteed in this case, I mean who are we kidding... On top of this considering the reports from eye witnesses we have, an explosive on the wing does seem like a more likely explanation. Regardless we have very little conclusive evidence either way.  \n\n\n>None of that was true.\n\nWhich makes this a rather definitive statement of fact, backed up by none of the facts or evidence which would be required in any journalistically sound report, considering it then follows up with relying upon supposed statements, twice removed, from an unnamed official. This isn't just hearsay from an unnamed Kremlin official, it's hearsay from a European they spoke to, who then themselves, supposedly spoke to a Kremlin official merely hours afterwards. There's also no details provided as to the background of the Kremlin official, whether they had any first hand knowledge etc. It isn't clear whether this unnamed official is positing their opinion, assessment or the actual operational truth as they saw it based on the details they have access to. This whole section is hearsay nonsense and even then it doesn't even provide any meat on the bones as far as useful information goes...  \n\n\nThey also describe the conversation as \"responded without hesitation\" which firstly doesn't really serve any purpose other than to add a level of narrative dramatization. It's also a claim from the European official taken as fact which is just a very small example of the lazy journalism here. This isn't a conversation they were party to, they have no idea if this is even remotely true, it could all be supposition on the Europeans part who for what it's worth is also an unnamed source. This should have been juxtaposed with the usual acknowledgements and caution that should be applied (or atleast ***should*** be applied) to statements this murky and multiple times removed. Instead the entire piece is reading as a statement of fact which is either extremely lazy journalism or by design to sell, both of which is a great example as to why people are losing trust in these institutions.  \n\n\nThe actual killing section is extremely limited and more or less just a summarization of everything we already know. They bagged out this story with anecdotes on Patrushev and it's extremely light on any real details regarding the assassination itself. The only difference this time around seems to be a few new quotations, *one of which is quite interesting, a name I recognized and wasn't really expecting to see but was a surprise nonetheless, Rolf Mowatt-Larssen*, he's got some interesting history and potentially some insights as far as things used to work and the background culture but they're extremely generous in providing credibility in this article.  \n\n\nIt should absolutely have been clarified that he was last CIA station chief for Moscow **during the \\*early 90s\\***. We're not talking about a former station chief that has any overview or direct access on the leadup events or the killing itself. **He was several decades removed** and has since gone on to trying to sell his memoirs and appearing on the paid talks circuit amongst other things for more than a decade now. (FWIW some of his talks are quite interesting to listen to should you come across them). He hasn't been tapped in to government intelligence since 2009, when he was working for DoE, and again that's a generous assessment.  \n\n\nFrom what I can gather he's suggesting a reason why Prigozhin was allowed to live, noting that you could see Putin's plan etc. This is his opinion and assessment, and to be clear likely an accurate one if we're all being honest. That being said it's still several decades removed and is just an assessment whereas the article brushes over it like a statement of fact, being extremely loose with its quotations.  \n\n\nHe was also deputy station chief for a little under two years back between **92-94**, and then only acting station chief for a handful of months after Morris, the actual station chief, was reciprocally expelled by the Russians after being identified. Mowatt-Larssen was moved on nearly immediately after the expulsion of his previous chief to a new posting in Zurich. He was acting chief of Moscow for an *extremely short timeframe*, his more than year as deputy was more noteworthy. In a technical sense he was a former station chief, however brief that was. But these are all contextual details that absolutely should have been included in the report as they're taking his assessment as fact, which considering his lengthy removal from the affairs, is generous at best.Then we've got this unnamed former Russian intelligence officer.  \n\n\n>In the beginning of August, as most of Moscow went on vacation, Patrushev, in his office in central Moscow, gave orders to his assistant to proceed in shaping an operation to dispose of Prigozhin, said the former Russian intelligence officer. Putin was later shown the plans and didn\u2019t object, Western intelligence agencies said.\n\nA lot of heavy lifting by that former unnamed Russian intelligence officer there. It's reading like the footnotes of a screenplay. Not only are they aware that the assistant shaped the operation, but that it also occurred at a relatively specific time in his office in central Moscow. That significantly narrows down the number of persons who could be aware of such an event and is a perfect reason as to why I'm doubting this unnamed source. Intelligence loops are relatively closed by design, there won't be a huge number of names on a list of people that knew about this operation. On-top of that there aren't really any smoking gun details here bar supposition and hearsay and just coming forwards with this, *if it's entirely accurate*, is enough to be identifiable regardless of whether the name is redacted, which to me at least casts doubt on the veracity of the source, or whether the source exists at all.  \n\n\nThis unnamed Russian source is more or less the reason for being for this entire article, without these statements and tie ins to Patrushev there is nothing new here bar a more detailed analysis of the plane bombing (a half paragraph quote from an unnamed western official) and a few follow-up quotations from various intelligence representatives, and even then the information from this Russian source isn't particularly deep or ground breaking. It merely casts support towards the assessment that western intelligence officials already made months ago, and that's extremely loose support considering it's an unnamed source which provides key details such as \"he planned the assassination in his office\", without anything more concrete or conclusive other than hearsay...  \n\n\nI dunno, this article just irked me in a few ways, more just the extremely narrative and story like style they were going for, I know that sells better amongst the general public and the WSJ has to pay the bills but either way it just came across as lazy. It might also be that I got this by several push notifications from numerous paid placements for this article alone in the last few hours, and any article that gets pushed this hard always bothers me when it comes across as lazy.",

If you would be forced to defend them, your fantasy hypothetical would fall apart. It is also why you&#39;ve slowly become more and more personal in your attacks as I&#39;ve asked you to defend them, because you can&#39;t even cite a simple poll or event to support your beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Your post started out non-credible hypothetical posting, and I was literally trying to get you to post some backup to your feelings in the hope you were just skipping the justification in the mistaken belief everyone already agreed with you on your basis.

Considering Russia&#39;s difficulty in conquering Ukraine, the calculation is likely that in a conventional war Russia would not last long. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So why are both Orban and Fico content to be Putin\u2019s lapdog in the EU? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who says they are? More likely both are just trying to get more. Orban particularly has used his veto to get EU funds released that were previously frozen. Additionally, Hungary has been courting Rheinmetall to build a plant to construct the Lynx IFV as well as development of the Panther. This all points to him trying to create a more independent Hungary from the EU. </p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t unprecedented either.

        "body": "[**How Putin\u2019s Right-Hand Man Took Out Prigozhin** *Nikolai Patrushev, a top ally of the Russian leader for decades, put in motion the assassination of the mutinous chief of the Wagner mercenary group*](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/putin-patrushev-plan-prigozhin-assassination-428d5ed8)  \n  \n\n> On the tarmac of a Moscow airport in late August, Yevgeny Prigozhin waited on his Embraer Legacy 600 for a safety check to finish before it could take off. The mercenary army chief was headed home to St. Petersburg with nine others onboard. Through the delay, no one inside the cabin noticed the small explosive device slipped under the wing.\n> \n> When the jet finally left, it climbed for about 30 minutes to 28,000 feet, before the wing blew apart, sending the aircraft spiraling to the ground. All 10 people were killed, including Prigozhin, the owner of the Wagner paramilitary group.\n> \n> The assassination of the warlord was two months in the making and approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s oldest ally and confidant, an ex-spy named Nikolai Patrushev, according to Western intelligence officials and a former Russian intelligence officer. The role of Patrushev as the driver of the plan to kill Prigozhin hasn\u2019t been previously reported.  \n> \n> The Kremlin has denied involvement in Prigozhin\u2019s death, and Putin offered the closest thing to an official explanation for the plane\u2019s fiery crash, suggesting a hand grenade had detonated onboard.\n> \n> None of that was true. \n> \n> Hours after the incident, a European involved in intelligence gathering who maintained a backchannel of communication with the Kremlin and saw news of the crash asked an official there what had happened.\n> \n> \u201cHe had to be removed,\u201d the Kremlin official responded without hesitation.  \n> \n> **Collision course**\n> \n> Patrushev had warned Putin for a long time that Moscow\u2019s reliance on Wagner in Ukraine was giving Prigozhin too much political and military clout that was increasingly threatening the Kremlin.\n> \n> With tens of thousands of troops and lucrative gold, timber and diamond operations in Africa, Prigozhin managed a multibillion-dollar empire overseas. But back in Russia and on the battlefield in Ukraine, his public confrontations with the military\u2019s top brass over weapons and supplies had put him on a collision course with the Kremlin.\n> \n> When that boiled over into an outright mutiny in late June against Russia\u2019s military commanders\u2014with an armed march on Moscow by some of Wagner\u2019s 25,000 fighters and tanks\u2014Patrushev stepped in to ward off the biggest challenge yet to Putin\u2019s more than two-decade rule. He also saw an opportunity to eliminate Prigozhin for good.  \n> \n> In interviews with Western intelligence agencies, former U.S. and Russian security and intelligence officials, and former Kremlin officials, The Wall Street Journal unearthed new details about the mutiny and murder of Russia\u2019s most powerful warlord and the previously unknown role of Patrushev in reasserting Putin\u2019s authority over an increasingly unstable Russia.\n> \n> Through the power of state-controlled media and his own persona, Putin has unsettled the West with his image as a determined adversary who rules Russia alone. In fact, he is kept in power by a vast bureaucracy that has proven durable through deepening hostilities with the West and rising domestic divisions over the botched invasion of Ukraine.\n> \n> Controlling the levers of that machine is Patrushev. He has climbed to the top by interpreting Putin\u2019s policies and carrying out his orders. Throughout Putin\u2019s reign, he has expanded Russia\u2019s security services and terrorized its enemies with assassinations at home and abroad. More recently his profile has grown, backing Russia\u2019s invasion, and his son Dmitry, a former banker, has been appointed agriculture minister and is touted by some as a potential successor to Putin.   \n> \n> Patrushev\u2019s handling of Prigozhin has helped Putin claim control ahead of the presidential elections next year.\n> \n> Former colleagues of Patrushev describe him as a sober bureaucrat who, like Putin, spurns the media, relying on daily readouts about the world from Russia\u2019s security services. Like Putin, he joined the spy services in the 1970s, and stuck with the service through the collapse of the Soviet Union when other officers flocked to more lucrative jobs in Russia\u2019s nascent private sector. \n> \n> Patrushev, 72, sees Russia locked in a struggle with the U.S., which he has said wants to steal Russia\u2019s oil and minerals. He salts conspiracy theories into speeches and interviews. Earlier this year, he told Russia\u2019s Izvestia newspaper that the U.S. is plotting to take over Russia because a massive volcanic eruption in Wyoming could soon make it uninhabitable. \n> \n> His role in some of the darker chapters of Putin\u2019s presidency underscore the often deadly consequences for anyone who falls afoul of the Kremlin.\n> \n> Russian officials and Patrushev didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n> \n> U.S. officials said soon after Prigozhin\u2019s death that preliminary government assessments found the crash was the result of an assassination plot.  \n> \n> **Rise of the spy**\n> \n> In photos of him and Putin, Patrushev is a figure in the background, mostly unnoticed in an unremarkable dark suit. Daily, he travels in a Russian-made Aurus limousine to his spartan office in the presidential administration complex, steps away from the Kremlin, said former Kremlin officials. His phone calls are usually encrypted.  \n> \n> Patrushev plunged into the world of spycraft at an early age in the Soviet city of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg. Recruited into the KGB after earning a degree in engineering, he attended the spy service\u2019s academy in Minsk. He soon worked in counterespionage and as an officer responsible for security in a region bordering Finland. \n> \n> With Putin, he suffered the collapse of the Soviet Union and the decline of the security services while the government of President Boris Yeltsin attempted to introduce Western-style economic reforms. When Yeltsin appointed Putin in 1999 to prime minister, Putin recommended Patrushev as his replacement to lead the new version of the KGB, the FSB.   \n> \n> Putin\u2019s rise to the presidency the following year buttressed Patrushev\u2019s authority. The men were linked by common origins and convictions that only strong security services could make Russia strong. \n> \n> As head of the spy agency, Patrushev began to reinvent the organization and referred to it in an interview at the time with the Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets as Russia\u2019s \u201cnew nobility.\u201d \n> \n> It was a sensitive moment for the new president, and Patrushev showed he was ready to help. In his first year as president, Putin was threatened by revelations that he had served as an adviser to a real-estate company being investigated in Europe for money laundering. Patrushev traveled to Ukraine to take possession of damaging evidence from that country\u2019s security service, according to audiotapes leaked from the Ukraine president\u2019s office. Parts of the tapes were later verified by the U.S. government. Putin denied any wrongdoing, and the scandal later died down.\n> \n> Patrushev soon signaled that traitors to the Kremlin would suffer. In 2006, Russia passed a law effectively legalizing extrajudicial killings of Russians abroad deemed terrorists or extremists. Months later, a former FSB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, who had fled to London and wrote about Putin and his own work as a spy, was killed by a dose of a radioactive substance in his tea.

The mercenary army chief was headed home to St. Petersburg with nine others onboard. Through the delay, no one inside the cabin noticed the small explosive device slipped under the wing.</p>\n\n<p>When the jet finally left, it climbed for about 30 minutes to 28,000 feet, before the wing blew apart, sending the aircraft spiraling to the ground. All 10 people were killed, including Prigozhin, the owner of the Wagner paramilitary group.</p>\n\n<p>The assassination of the warlord was two months in the making and approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s oldest ally and confidant, an ex-spy named Nikolai Patrushev, according to Western intelligence officials and a former Russian intelligence officer. The role of Patrushev as the driver of the plan to kill Prigozhin hasn\u2019t been previously reported.  </p>\n\n<p>The Kremlin has denied involvement in Prigozhin\u2019s death, and Putin offered the closest thing to an official explanation for the plane\u2019s fiery crash, suggesting a hand grenade had detonated onboard.</p>\n\n<p>None of that was true. </p>\n\n<p>Hours after the incident, a European involved in intelligence gathering who maintained a backchannel of communication with the Kremlin and saw news of the crash asked an official there what had happened.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe had to be removed,\u201d the Kremlin official responded without hesitation.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Collision course</strong></p>\n\n<p>Patrushev had warned Putin for a long time that Moscow\u2019s reliance on Wagner in Ukraine was giving Prigozhin too much political and military clout that was increasingly threatening the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>With tens of thousands of troops and lucrative gold, timber and diamond operations in Africa, Prigozhin managed a multibillion-dollar empire overseas. But back in Russia and on the battlefield in Ukraine, his public confrontations with the military\u2019s top brass over weapons and supplies had put him on a collision course with the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>When that boiled over into an outright mutiny in late June against Russia\u2019s military commanders\u2014with an armed march on Moscow by some of Wagner\u2019s 25,000 fighters and tanks\u2014Patrushev stepped in to ward off the biggest challenge yet to Putin\u2019s more than two-decade rule. He also saw an opportunity to eliminate Prigozhin for good.  </p>\n\n<p>In interviews with Western intelligence agencies, former U.S. and Russian security and intelligence officials, and former Kremlin officials, The Wall Street Journal unearthed new details about the mutiny and murder of Russia\u2019s most powerful warlord and the previously unknown role of Patrushev in reasserting Putin\u2019s authority over an increasingly unstable Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Through the power of state-controlled media and his own persona, Putin has unsettled the West with his image as a determined adversary who rules Russia alone. In fact, he is kept in power by a vast bureaucracy that has proven durable through deepening hostilities with the West and rising domestic divisions over the botched invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Controlling the levers of that machine is Patrushev. He has climbed to the top by interpreting Putin\u2019s policies and carrying out his orders. Throughout Putin\u2019s reign, he has expanded Russia\u2019s security services and terrorized its enemies with assassinations at home and abroad. More recently his profile has grown, backing Russia\u2019s invasion, and his son Dmitry, a former banker, has been appointed agriculture minister and is touted by some as a potential successor to Putin.   </p>\n\n<p>Patrushev\u2019s handling of Prigozhin has helped Putin claim control ahead of the presidential elections next year.</p>\n\n<p>Former colleagues of Patrushev describe him as a sober bureaucrat who, like Putin, spurns the media, relying on daily readouts about the world from Russia\u2019s security services. Like Putin, he joined the spy services in the 1970s, and stuck with the service through the collapse of the Soviet Union when other officers flocked to more lucrative jobs in Russia\u2019s nascent private sector. </p>\n\n<p>Patrushev, 72, sees Russia locked in a struggle with the U.S., which he has said wants to steal Russia\u2019s oil and minerals. He salts conspiracy theories into speeches and interviews. Earlier this year, he told Russia\u2019s Izvestia newspaper that the U.S. is plotting to take over Russia because a massive volcanic eruption in Wyoming could soon make it uninhabitable. </p>\n\n<p>His role in some of the darker chapters of Putin\u2019s presidency underscore the often deadly consequences for anyone who falls afoul of the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>Russian officials and Patrushev didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials said soon after Prigozhin\u2019s death that preliminary government assessments found the crash was the result of an assassination plot.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rise of the spy</strong></p>\n\n<p>In photos of him and Putin, Patrushev is a figure in the background, mostly unnoticed in an unremarkable dark suit. Daily, he travels in a Russian-made Aurus limousine to his spartan office in the presidential administration complex, steps away from the Kremlin, said former Kremlin officials. His phone calls are usually encrypted.  </p>\n\n<p>Patrushev plunged into the world of spycraft at an early age in the Soviet city of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg. Recruited into the KGB after earning a degree in engineering, he attended the spy service\u2019s academy in Minsk. He soon worked in counterespionage and as an officer responsible for security in a region bordering Finland. </p>\n\n<p>With Putin, he suffered the collapse of the Soviet Union and the decline of the security services while the government of President Boris Yeltsin attempted to introduce Western-style economic reforms. When Yeltsin appointed Putin in 1999 to prime minister, Putin recommended Patrushev as his replacement to lead the new version of the KGB, the FSB.   </p>\n\n<p>Putin\u2019s rise to the presidency the following year buttressed Patrushev\u2019s authority. The men were linked by common origins and convictions that only strong security services could make Russia strong. </p>\n\n<p>As head of the spy agency, Patrushev began to reinvent the organization and referred to it in an interview at the time with the Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets as Russia\u2019s \u201cnew nobility.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>It was a sensitive moment for the new president, and Patrushev showed he was ready to help. In his first year as president, Putin was threatened by revelations that he had served as an adviser to a real-estate company being investigated in Europe for money laundering. Patrushev traveled to Ukraine to take possession of damaging evidence from that country\u2019s security service, according to audiotapes leaked from the Ukraine president\u2019s office. Parts of the tapes were later verified by the U.S. government. Putin denied any wrongdoing, and the scandal later died down.</p>\n\n<p>Patrushev soon signaled that traitors to the Kremlin would suffer. In 2006, Russia passed a law effectively legalizing extrajudicial killings of Russians abroad deemed terrorists or extremists. Months later, a former FSB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, who had fled to London and wrote about Putin and his own work as a spy, was killed by a dose of a radioactive substance in his tea. A British judge said that Patrushev probably approved the murder.  </p>\n\n<p>As FSB director, Patrushev had hoped to foster cooperation with the West\u2019s own antiterror efforts, which were then in full bloom in the U.S. after the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. But Litvinenko\u2019s poisoning, which contaminated a sushi restaurant in downtown London, began to sow questions about any cooperation. The assassination was one of the first of more mysterious killings of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe and the Middle East that Western officials suspected were linked to Moscow.</p>\n\n<p>When Russia convened an international counterterrorism conference in the city of Khabarovsk in 2007, the CIA declined to send any high-ranking officials, instead offering a lower-profile group headed by a former CIA station chief, Rolf Mowatt-Larssen. Mowatt-Larssen said Patrushev took him aside to say he was offended. \u201cHe said \u2018Please take this message back to the CIA,\u2019\u201d Mowatt-Larssen said. \u201c\u2018You aren\u2019t taking us seriously.\u2019\u201d </p>\n\n<p>In 2008, Putin promoted Patrushev to secretary of Russia\u2019s national security council, a post that confers little formal power.

Ultimately, he delivered an offer hashed out by Patrushev: If Prigozhin turned his troops around, his men would be allowed to decamp to Belarus.</p>\n\n<p>Lukashenko had several rounds of talks with Prigozhin, as well as Putin, his press service said in a statement to the Journal. \u201cThe talks delivered success,\u201d the statement said.</p>\n\n<p>In a late morning television appearance, Putin called Prigozhin and the Wagner leadership traitors, helping persuade him to take the offer, which included retaining control of his overseas operations, such as those in Africa. </p>\n\n<p>While Prigozhin and his fighters hadn\u2019t encountered active resistance from the military, most units they encountered weren\u2019t joining them either. By early Saturday evening, Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny had come to an end. </p>\n\n<p>Prigozhin\u2019s fighters who were heading toward Moscow stopped and some began marching toward camps putatively prepared for them in Belarus. Prigozhin himself disappeared from social media.</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of the summer, an uneasiness settled on Moscow. Few in the Kremlin believed that Prigozhin would get away with an armed mutiny with no consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Patrushev would prove them right.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
