The 38th is the 503rd Marine Battalion which has been slowly metastasizing into a larger unit for months now, and forms the bulk of the new Brigade. The 37th is rumored to be organized around a battalion transferring from the air assault forces (79th Brigade?).  Both new brigades are augmented by the many veterans returning to active duty not needed by the 35th/36th, as these have been continually replenished.\n\nThe Air Assault forces have identified their new unit as the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, but formation is in early stages.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ground forces have formally announced the new 41st OMB  since my last update. As it was just announced yesterday, I lack any detail.  Additionally, the Kalinouski Regiment is following the path of the 3rd/5th Assault Brigades and the 67th OMB (right Sector) of slowly accreting from a battalion, to a regiment, to a brigade- a size/status they should reach before  several of the formally announced new brigades are ready.  \n\nThe 47th Brigade has completed training in Germany and are back 'in country', but I would be surprised to see them on the defensive line- With their M-2s, they are surely held back for the spring offensive. \n\nThe 13th Jaeger brigade looks to be about good to go, but I can't confirm if they are a mech infantry unit- Their training posts emphasize woodcraft and dismounted assault.  From everything I've seen, they could very well be a light infantry unit. \n\nThe 21st OMB is easier to pin down, straight mech infantry, with a high proportion of British equipment. Training near Odessa, they appear far along, having poached a fair number of personnel from the 58th Motorized Brigade. \n\nThe 33rd 'Wolf's Head' Brigade have moved on from their training grounds near the Slovakian border to the theater of the war; though I assume they are in extended training, there's some indication that forces have been cycled into the line to some extent. \n\nThe 88th OMB were doing combined arms assault/ night assault training a couple weeks ago, which imply they have advanced level of training/cohesion, but beyond confirming they have a battery of 105mms and T-72 tanks, details are not available in the public sphere. \n\nThe 22nd OMB formed at the same time, but they have no social network footprint, so I have no specifics.\n\nI lack specifics for the 116th OMB, except that I can confirm that they are in training far enough advanced to be soliciting donations for drones/ ambulances/SUVs, ect., they have been officially added into the logistical supply chain and that they are forming around the 10th Separate Rifle Battalion. \n\nAs for the 23rd OMB, 31st OMB, 32nd OMB, 117th OMB and the 118th OMB, all are allegedly in a state of organization and training, but I lack specifics, other than rumor that the 50th Rifle and 214th Assault battalions are on the ingredients list.\n\nIn addition to Infantry, rumors persist that a new armor brigade is forming but unless they are forming around western supplied armor to 'maximize the punch' color me skeptical- There's commitments of 15-17 armored battalions on the board for the infantry brigades, and that's already in the ballpark of 500 tanks. \n\nFinally, a note regarding the Interior Ministry. Recruitment and expansion has been focused on the Offensive Guard project, the creation of 8 brigades of assault infantry for the spring offensive. Much of this force appears cannibalized from existing national guard units, some swallowed whole. The MI posted yesterday that recruitment closes in two weeks, but most of these brigades already have some element already on the line, some in serious combat!  As such, I'm not considering any of the Offensive Guard to be new brigades, but the existing unit structures are being expanded, perhaps massively expanded. We may end up with hybrid brigades with 4-6 infantry battalions, like TDBs, with equipment half mech and half motorized brigade in composition. \n\nFor the two separate artillery brigades, the 47th is engaged in combined arms coordination training, and is available to support the Kharkiv front, if not actively deployed.  The 49th Brigade was announced just this week, so no specifics are available.\n\n\nIn summary, the AFU has added 17 brigades to the table of organization all in various states of training/organization, plus 3 brigades on the line since December.  In addition, the National Guard is creating an 8 brigade force, though quantifying what is new and what is reorganized is difficult.\n\nAs always, I invite and encourage any additional information or clarifications anyone can provide. And as aways, I note that I possess no inside information, or confidential facts- I'm just fairly good at summarizing what I can scrape up from various websites, news posts, social media posts and discord servers.\n\nEdit: duplicate word.",

These are the 60s series OMBs, one of which  the Russians derided as a 'unit of grandfathers and women' on the Kherson front.

American basic training was 8 weeks back in the Cold War days, but the initial three weeks were just learning drill, getting people into shape, and general grab ass.

Lieutenant General Mark Hertling described its tactics in eastern Ukraine as \u201clike feeding meat to a meat grinder.\u201d\n\n> Last week, Prigozhin said that Wagner had opened recruitment efforts in 42 cities in Russia.\n\n> Wagner has focused its attention on recruiting mercenaries from sports clubs, boxing gyms, and other gyms, as well as men who have previously completed six-month contracts and could be rehired. Wagner has also recruited a small number of foreign fighters.\n\n>CNN previously reported that Wagner said it stopped recruiting from prisons in January. The prison recruitment campaign was well publicized and widespread, netting as many as 40,000 fighters for Wagner last year.\n\n>But many of the private military group\u2019s recruits have been killed or wounded in heavy fighting around the city of Bakhmut, the scene of a months-long battle.\n\n>That the group is seeking tens of thousands of new fighters suggests that it has sustained major losses in the conflict.\n\n>Earlier this month, Prigozhin acknowledged that the situation in Bakhmut was \u201cdifficult, very difficult, with the enemy fighting each other for each meter.\u201d\n\n> Although Wagner made incremental gains around Bakhmut and now holds the eastern part of the city, this came at huge costs.

He accused Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense of trying to strangle his force.\n\n>A Ukrainian military intelligence report obtained by CNN detailed the remorseless tactics used by Wagner.

Ratio is still favorable even now, but isn't nearly as good as it used to be. \n\n* Kofman says he doesn't necessarily question Ukraine's decision to hold the city, claiming he doesn't like armchair generalship, but he does note that there is a \"significant risk\" of encirclement there adding that \"if you were there John, you'd be worried too.\" He's more worried about Ukraine holding the surrounding environments and supply lines as opposed to the city itself. \n\n* Russian gains in and around Bakhmut aren't from Wagner human wave attacks (which Kofman once again is trying to debunk) but due to Wagner professional forces as well as Russian VDV units. Wagner prisoner units help by wearing down Ukrainian forces and exposing positions, but they aren't just thrown in mass waves, they have a primitive but effective organization in the field. \n\n* Wagner professional units are organized into around 4 detachments of about 50-60 men each comprised of 2 assault detachments, along with a 1 fire support detachment, and 1 logistics/evacuation detachment. Positions are softened by Wagner artillery and/or Russian military artillery in support, before assault detachments advance. These assault detachments are themselves sometimes specially trained and equipped to operate exclusively at night or in the morning. \n\n* Russia has an advantage in manpower if they keep mobilizing, so Ukraine can't bank solely on attriting Russian forces over the longterm. Biggest longterm concern for Ukraine is force quality. They have an advantage over Russia there, but that advantage isn't as high as it was previously, Ukraine has lost a lot of their best personnel. \n\n* Ukraine's army looks nothing like it did pre-war: its expanded greatly, lost a lot of its best trained personnel, and had to build out the force by bringing back more retired officers that have Soviet approach to fighting. \n\n* Kofman wished he saw more defensive preparations around Chasiv Yar than he did, says he thinks Ukraine is heavily committed to holding Bakhmut itself. He's hopeful they have a good plan b though. He suggested again that Ukraine might launch a major counterattack in Bakhmut, but he's not sure what exactly the Ukrainian plan is.",

Earlier reports indicate that Type 12 short-range, anti-ship missiles have been placed on nearby Miyako Island and that there were already over 150 troops on Yonaguni Island, which is just over 100 km from Taiwan...\n\n>Japan and the U.S. have previously discussed joint weapons storage on the islands near Taiwan and it is expected that a U.S. Marine littoral regiment will eventually be deployed to the area as well.\n\nThis last bit about possible Marine deployments to Yonaguni or Ishigaki makes much more sense than the poster on here who previously suggested a Marine littoral regiment could deploy to Kinmen (lol).

Earlier reports indicate that Type 12 short-range, anti-ship missiles have been placed on nearby Miyako Island and that there were already over 150 troops on Yonaguni Island, which is just over 100 km from Taiwan...</p>\n\n<p>Japan and the U.S. have previously discussed joint weapons storage on the islands near Taiwan and it is expected that a U.S. Marine littoral regiment will eventually be deployed to the area as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This last bit about possible Marine deployments to Yonaguni or Ishigaki makes much more sense than the poster on here who previously suggested a Marine littoral regiment could deploy to Kinmen (lol). There&#39;s also been suggestions about how these units could <a href=\"https://eurasiantimes.com/us-marine-littoral-regiment-to-be-armed-with-deadly-nmesis-missiles/\">deploy to Itbayat Island in the Philippines</a>.
