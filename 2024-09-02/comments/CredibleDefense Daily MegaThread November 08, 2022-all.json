        "body": ">**[Putin\u2019s Elite Tremble as Hardliners Call for \u2018Stalinist\u2019 Steps](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-08/rise-of-russia-hardliner-yevgeny-prigozhin-fuels-fear-in-putin-s-elite)**\n\n>The rise of outspoken hardliners in the Kremlin is alarming insiders fearful the Russian president will heed their calls for even more confrontation abroad and sweeping repression at home. \nSenior business executives and government officials have watched with growing worry as players they once considered marginal like Yevgeny Prigozhin, known for his Wagner mercenary company and recruiting of prison inmates to fight in Ukraine, have become the public forces behind Vladimir Putin\u2019s push to step up his increasingly all-encompassing war effort.\n\n>Prigozhin\u2019s public calls for \u201curgent Stalinist repressions\u201d against business tycoons who aren\u2019t sufficiently enthusiastic about supporting the war effort have led some rich Russians to fear for their own safety and that of their families, they said. Prigozhin\u2019s open attacks on top military commanders - some of whom have been subsequently removed - and the prominent Putin ally who is governor of St. Petersburg, have added to worry within the bureaucracy about the Kremlin\u2019s unwillingness or inability to defend its own.\n\n>With Kremlin officials now describing the invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cpeople\u2019s war,\u201d hearkening back to the World War II rhetoric of Josef Stalin, a few insiders even say they fear the purges and arbitrary arrests of the the Soviet dictator\u2019s rule may not be far behind. Amid the call-up of 300,000 reservists, officials furtively asked each other if family members were safe, worried about too openly admitting that they\u2019d sent their military-age children abroad.\n\n>One senior official likened the current situation to a military dictatorship but without the military coup that usually precedes it. The dominant emotion now is fear, insiders said. All those interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the risk of reprisal. \n\n>The deepening alarm about the outlook so far hasn\u2019t coalesced into anything like internal resistance to Putin\u2019s continuing escalation, according to insiders. Many in the leadership support what they see as an existential fight for Russia\u2019s future and see no alternative but to keep boosting the pressure until Ukraine and its allies in the US and Europe back down. A few officials once thought of as relative liberals, such as Sergei Kiriyenko, Kremlin deputy chief of staff, have emerged as enthusiastic public advocates of the war. \n\n>While Putin has said the mobilization is over, at least for the moment, many in the business and bureaucratic elite worry the militarization of the economy and society is only accelerating. The special commission of top government and security official Putin set up to coordinate economic policy to support the defense industry and the army has been compared to Stalin\u2019s war cabinet.\n\n>\u201cThe state has lost the monopoly on legalized violence and new operators of this former monopoly have appeared,\u201d said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist who left Russia in the early weeks of the war. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that Putin is encouraging this.\u201d\n\n>Nearly nine months of fighting has only hardened the view among many in the business and economic elite that Putin\u2019s invasion was a catastrophic mistake that will doom the country to isolation and weakness. Even within the government, many quietly oppose the fight but are too terrified to speak out, according to people close to the leadership. Tycoons have sought to stay out of politics, hoping to remain on the Kremlin\u2019s good side and keep factories running.  Only a few have left the country and publicly criticized the war.\n\n>Putin has no alternative but to rely on aggressive players like Prigozhin and Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman head of Russia\u2019s Chechnya region who has sent thousands of troops to fight, given the poor performance so far of Russia\u2019s regular military and tepid support for the war in his own government, according to one senior official. Both men have heavily armed forces loyal to them.\n\n>>\u201cPrigozhin is behaving like a parallel government,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cHe may be able to compete for power, if not under Putin then after him.\u201d\n\n>Known as \u2018Putin\u2019s chef\u2019 for his background in the restaurant business in the president\u2019s hometown of St. Petersburg and Kremlin catering contracts, Prigozhin, 61, has been sanctioned by the US and its allies for a range of alleged transgressions, including meddling in US elections and sending mercenaries to Africa and the Middle East. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation put him on its wanted list in 2021 for vote interference.\n\n>After years of playing down his links to the Wagner private military contracting company, Prigozhin in late September publicly confirmed he\u2019d founded the group in 2014. On Nov. 4, he opened a glass-and-steel skyscraper in St. Petersburg called the Wagner Center. This week, he sarcastically admitted his role in meddling in US elections, saying it would continue.\n\n>He\u2019s shown up in leaked videos from prisons around Russia where he promised inmates the chance of early release if they sign up to fight in Ukraine and last six months at the front. At the same time, he warns they\u2019ll be summarily shot for desertion or attempting to surrender. Prigozhin\u2019s press office declined to confirm he was in the videos, but said the person in them \u201clooked frightfully like\u201d him.\n\n>Over the weekend, Prigozhin announced Wagner plans to set up training centers for \u201cmilitias\u201d in border regions near the war zone. Fighters would come from \u201clocal businesses,\u201d which would send a quarter of its male workforce to \u201cthe trenches,\u201d he said in a commentary posted on Telegram, promising to fund the preparations himself.\n\n>Prigozhin earlier this month, filed a rare complaint with prosecutors against the governor of St. Petersburg, a Putin ally and longtime rival of the tycoon. The Kremlin\u2019s public silence in the case has shocked insiders. \n\n>Prigozhin has appeared wearing the Hero of Russia medal, the country\u2019s highest honor, but how frequently he and Putin meet remains unclear. Some Kremlin insiders said Prigozhin now meets with the president more often than before, while others said he\u2019s not a member of the small group of hardliners closest to Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, \u201cThere are lots of rumors about Prigozhin. We don\u2019t have any intention to comment on them.\"\n\n>Prigozhin said he hasn\u2019t spoken to Putin. He is seen as an ally of the new commander Putin installed to run the Ukraine operation in October, Sergei Surovikin, who was known for his harsh tactics in Syria, where they fought together with Wagner troops.\n\n>US intelligence has told President Joe Biden that Prigozhin spoke directly to Putin about the war, countering upbeat reports from the military, according to the Washington Post. \n\n>Prigozhin has made common cause with Kadyrov, the Chechen leader, with both at times questioning the skills of the military leadership, especially when Ukraine\u2019s forces were actively retaking territory in September. \n\n>Insiders describe the Russian president as increasingly isolated, surrounded by a small group of hardliners and impervious to critical views. With its forces struggling to contain a Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Kremlin has dropped months of trying to insulate the country from the reality of the conflict.\n\n>Putin has steadily stepped up the fight since Ukrainian forces began pushing back his troops in large areas over the late summer. So far, his mobilization of reservists, sweeping expansion of missile strikes against civilian infrastructure like power plants behind the lines in Ukraine and hints of possible use of nuclear weapons haven\u2019t succeeded in turning the tide. Ukraine\u2019s advance is continuing, with Russia losing territory Putin claimed to annex in September.\n\n>Last month, he ordered versions of martial law across large areas of Russia. \n\n>Government technocrats, meanwhile, have been tasked with revising budget and economic plans to reflect the steadily increasing shift of resources to fund the war. They\u2019ve also been assigned to computerize the mobilization process to avoid a repeat of the disorganization and mistakes that plagued the first round. Many officials expect another round to be announced early next year.\n\n>>\u201cThe mood of doom that everything has turned out this way is very strong,\u201d said Tatyana Stanovaya, founder of R Politik, a political consultancy.\n\nSource is Bloomberg, will post link as soon as article becomes available publicly.",

        "body": "Inspired by a comment yesterday from u/fknshtcnt that pointed out that 1 in 2,800 Russian citizens had died in Ukraine I wanted to put into context the impact of the War in Ukraine on Russian demographics. Whilst their figure is more or less correct (it may be closer to 1 in 2,000 if western estimates are right) it doesn\u2019t consider that the deaths come from a narrow slice of Russia\u2019s population (fighting age males) or that this isn\u2019t the only impact the war is having on Russian demographics. I\u2019m going to do a little dive into the context, all figures are from Wikipedia.\n\nThe Russian population is 147m with 35% (around 51m) being 18-44 (the age range the vast majority of casualties will come from). This age group does slightly favour males so the deaths are coming from a group of around 26m Russian fighting age males. This means that around 1 in 520 to 1 in 325 men of fighting age have died (based on 50-80,000 Russian deaths), if we speculate that these figures heavily skew to Russians in their 20s and consider the age distribution of Russia this proportion could be more than 1 in 200 Russian males in their 20s dying.\n\nNext we have to consider seriously injured and very seriously injured. In Afghanistan the ratio of British soldiers killed to seriously injured and very seriously injured was around 2 to 3, whilst the circumstances may differ in Ukraine and the ratio may be different using this figure as a baseline it is conceivable that 1 in 80 Russian males in their 20s have been killed, seriously injured or very seriously injured in this conflict.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Reports are that 900,000 Russians have emigrated from Russia since the war started with the majority looking to avoid conscription. Whilst there is no demographic estimates of this group it is fair to assume that the numbers skew male and young given the motivation of this group (avoiding conscription or anti-war liberal beliefs). Whilst this group may not be permanently lost to Russia there are clear reasons for this group not to return whilst Putin or a successor regime is in power (fear of punitive reprisals). If we say that 1 in 3 of the 900,000 emigrees are males in their 20s (I could be convinced that this number is too high or too low) that\u2019s a further 300k Russian males in their 20s that have left the Russian population.\n\nIn summary from approximately 8m Russian males in their 20s, it is conceivable that 100k are dead, seriously injured or very seriously injured (40k/30k/30k) and a further 300k have left the country in opposition to the war/avoiding conscription. That equates to 1 in 20, or 5% or Russian males in their 20s. This is a huge blow to Russia both in terms of it\u2019s current work force and its future population growth (especially considering that the Russian birth rate has already dropped dramatically over the last 30 years).\n\nPlease feel free to challenge my figures, this is not a scientific analysis and a lot of the numbers are speculative. My wiki sources are:\n\n[Russian Casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War#2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)\n\n[Russian Demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia#Age_structure)\n\n[Russian Emigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_emigration_following_the_2022_invasion_of_Ukraine#:~:text=Following%20the%202022%20Russian%20invasion,and%20conscientious%20objectors%2C%20making%20a)\n\n[British Casualties in Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_casualties_in_Afghanistan_since_2001#cite_note-4)\n\nEdit 1: I have completely misread the Russian casualty figures, western estimates are 80k casualties total  but only around 25k dead.  This feels low (Ukraine estimated 65k dead a month ago which is probably high) but my a more realistic estimate is 20k dead Russian males in their 20s, 15k seriously wounded and 15k very seriously wounded). This changes my overall figure to 1 in 23 or 4.3%",

Regardless of the reasons, good or bad, for the Russians to still be trying to take Bakhmut, the UAF have a great need tactically and operationally to hold the city, if it falls then the Siversk-Bakhmut defensive line is compromised, without any further fixed defensive line until Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka, many kilometers to the west (the UAF lose another 1/4 of Donetsk oblast). With the Russians clearly intent on taking Bakhmut, the UA  needs to hold it or face an unnecessary operational dilemma that will only give the Russians a victory at a time they desperately want one.\n\nMaybe the 93rd might need to reinforce the defenses in Bakhmut, to provide more depth. Or conduct a relief in place for a unit that's currently battered and about to break. Or staging for another counterattack (there was recently a successful one a week ago, they might want to replicate that on a regular basis and need a fully capable offensive focused mech inf bde to pull it off). However it's used, good units are supposed to go to important sectors, and that's what the Bakhmut area of operations is now, at least until the Russians stop trying to take it.\n\nSeverodonetsk was totally different, that was purely a political objective, indefinitely trying to hold a city attacked on three sides and thus in a deep salient, on the wrong side of the river, forgoing the advantage to defend a much shorter line from the heights of Lysychansk overwatching the Donets. That was a stupid mistake, the type of which led to more serious sectors being undermanned and then taken by the Russians.",

What is preferable, a life of quite compliance living in luxury provided by the blood and toil of others, or life in a bunker running from hole to hole trying to win back the ruins of your country. The true threat of the superpower, be it the US, Russia, or China isn\u2019t that they\u2019ll always beat you if it comes to a fight. It\u2019s that they\u2019ll make sure that no matter who wins, you\u2019ll have paid a price well beyond what victory wins you. It all goes back to Thucydides.</p>\n</div>",
