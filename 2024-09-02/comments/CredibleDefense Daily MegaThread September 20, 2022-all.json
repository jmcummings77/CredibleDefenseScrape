Whether its enough or whether organizationally they'll be used effectively is a different story.\n\n>What does the Kremlin/military think is going to happen after mobilization? I must be missing something regarding the mobilization that Putin and his deputies know. To me it looks like a whole lot more poorly trained and ill-equipped troops thrown at a professional, motivated, trained, well-equipped army.\n\nThis is I think the big mystery. In theory at least, having enough mobilized manpower would have prevented Ukraine from achieving breakthroughs like in Kharkov, which relied on the Russian defensive line being deeply undermanned. Poorly trained conscripts are pretty good on defense as long as they're able to be resupplied and supported by artillery, which so far Russia has been able to do relatively well along the line.\n\n> How many people could practically be conscripted?

It is a costly strategy that takes a long time to come to fruition, but it can often ensure victory when other strategies cannot, and in Ukraine's case, the cost is preferable over the alternative, which is Russian conquest. It can also be the only viable strategy if going on the offensive would be so costly for you that you'd exhaust yourself before the enemy; attritional war sometimes is the only answer to attritional war. \n\nFor an attritional strategy to actually work, it is vital that the enemy will exhaust itself before you do. In Ukraine's case, its war effort is basically sponsored by NATO, far and away the strongest military alliance in the world, which is also simultaneously fighting a trade war with Russia. So long as NATO maintains support for Ukraine, Russia exhausting itself before Ukraine is basically a given, which is why so much effort goes into maintaining aid by Zelenskyy.\n\nThere are plenty historical examples where such a strategy eventually wins the war: the French invasion of Russia, the US revolutionary war, the US civil war, the war in Afghanistan twice, World War 1 and 2, and (of course) both of the Punic wars. The second Punic war actually gives the Fabian strategy (where you withdraw into your own territory to stretch enemy supply lines as an attritional strategy) its name. \n\nSecondly, there are plenty of examples of Ukraine taking an attrition approach, rather than relying on maneuvre/pitched battles. The battle of Kiev (and wider early war) was largely characterized by a defense in depth, combining defending the city with shoot-and-scoot Javelin attacks on the supply convoys headed toward said cities. When they first got HIMARS, they used them to target enemy ammunition depots, rather than immediately using them for a pitched battle. Even during te battle of Kherson, a lot of effort is going toward interdicting Russian supplies over the Dnieper, and I'm arguing that this interdiction is instrumental to achieving this offensive's goals.\n\nThis brings me to my final point: my understanding of the battle of Kherson is that it is *not* Ukraine throwing men into the meatgrinder. Instead, it is that Ukraine has created such a situation where it is able to inflict disproportionate casualties on Russia while being on the offensive. Paradoxically, increasing the pace of war by losing more soldiers can lead the enemy to crumble quicker, thereby saving lives. I believe that this is what Ukraine is attempting to do.",

Again, that's a deterrent, that tells the Russians before they even move anything how difficult that operation is going to be for them and that the UAF aren't even waiting to try to disable the bridges. \n\n>If that was deliberate it's disinformation.\n\nDisinformation is defined as \"false information which is intended to mislead.\" There was nothing false about the Kherson counteroffensive. It was launched. The UAF hoped to liberate a lot of territory. They've celebrated every square centimeter they've liberated. They've talked up how much they plan on liberating in the future. It's real, not false. \n\n>A feint has to look realistic to be successful.\n\nI agree. Except the evidence points that Kherson isn't a feint, and they took the deliberate steps before starting it in order to deter Russians from reinforcing it. It's a totally separate operation done by a totally separate operational command. \n\n>The question is whether that was the plan or just luck.\n\nI think it was neither. The plan was likely to deter Russia from contesting the Kherson bridgehead counteroffensive by striking the bridges first to show how untenable a defense of the right side would be. When that failed and the Russians reinforced the right side that unexpectedly created an opportunity to attack a weak point created when the Russians pulled nearly all the reinforcements from one area and left it bare. \n\nThe UAF had a Plan A but then reacted well with a Plan B when the Russians decided to do the illogical.

Again, that&#39;s a deterrent, that tells the Russians before they even move anything how difficult that operation is going to be for them and that the UAF aren&#39;t even waiting to try to disable the bridges. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If that was deliberate it&#39;s disinformation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Disinformation is defined as &quot;false information which is intended to mislead.&quot; There was nothing false about the Kherson counteroffensive. It was launched. The UAF hoped to liberate a lot of territory. They&#39;ve celebrated every square centimeter they&#39;ve liberated. They&#39;ve talked up how much they plan on liberating in the future. It&#39;s real, not false. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A feint has to look realistic to be successful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree. Except the evidence points that Kherson isn&#39;t a feint, and they took the deliberate steps before starting it in order to deter Russians from reinforcing it. It&#39;s a totally separate operation done by a totally separate operational command. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The question is whether that was the plan or just luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it was neither. The plan was likely to deter Russia from contesting the Kherson bridgehead counteroffensive by striking the bridges first to show how untenable a defense of the right side would be. When that failed and the Russians reinforced the right side that unexpectedly created an opportunity to attack a weak point created when the Russians pulled nearly all the reinforcements from one area and left it bare. </p>\n\n<p>The UAF had a Plan A but then reacted well with a Plan B when the Russians decided to do the illogical. They showed flexibility, which alone is worth praising.</p>\n</div>",

The \"shaping operations\" started in late August. The UA govt announced the Kherson counteroffensive in mid July.

The first reports of Russians starting to move reinforcements to Kherson was July 25-7, but mostly early to mid August.\n\nI think you're not realizing the significance of PGM strikes on the only reliable supply lines in and out of the bridgehead. That isn't designed to entice the Russians to reinforce the Kherson bridgehead, it's trying to cut the means of doing it. That's telling the Russians up front how difficult such a defensive operation on the right side is going to be, and that's BEFORE they reinforced (which made logistics more challenging). \n\nPicture yourself planning an ambush when you're wanting to suck the enemy into a kill zone. Do you bait it with something that makes them want to enter? Or do you block them from entering the kill zone? \n\nIf Kherson really was a feint, the bridges probably still wouldn't be targeted, or would only recently been destroyed. Because they'd have wanted to suck in the maximum number of Russians into the kill zone AND THEN cut off their means of resupply, reinforcements, and retreat.\n\nAlso, the reason the Kherson bridgehead counteroffensive isn't a feint is because they're still attacking, still trying to get results. And there was absolutely no way to even contemplate the Russians would reinforce it at all, let alone do it in the stupidest manner possible by basically thinning out the Izyum sector to the point they had paramilitary units on the front lines, and no reserve. \n\n>What may be false is what Ukraine hoped to achieve, it's entirely conceivable that this feint was designed to draw in and trap Russian which is exactly what it's done, the question is whether that was deliberate or simply how things have played out.\n\nUkraine hasn't trapped the Russians on the right side, there is no proof they can't escape. They've even been resupplying despite no intact bridges, which means their supply lines are still open (though very hindered). \n\nWhat the timeline and events suggest is that the original UAF plan was to avoid a long, bloody, costly campaign to eject the Russians from the right side by convincing the Russians to abandon it using a PSYOP campaign to emphasize the futility of the endeavor. They're likely still pursuing that, right now, by openly suggesting they don't care about liberating land (which is nonsense, they care very much about that), while pushing the attrition aspect. That's further motivation to the Russians to retreat, as they have no hope of any sort of victory.\n\nIf the UAF don't really care if they retake ground it means they don't have to attack in the near term, there is no pressure coming from higher HQ to get results. That means the only possible means of a Russian operational \"success,\" to bloody a UAF attack with a stubborn defense in depth, aided by the UAF need to achieve success (which pressures subordinate commanders to keep attacking despite high casualties)  can't work because they don't have attackers to kill.

It reduces the discussion to memes.\n\nAnyone who thinks mobilization will have no significant effects on the war, or believes that full Ukrainian victory is guarantees is kidding himself. \n\nOnce again it comes down to how much outside forces will choose to up support for Ukraine to face this new challenge, how quickly will they react, and whether the reactions will be effective enough. With each escelation, the price that the west has to pay to support Ukraine increases too, billions in military aid are not insignificant.

If the lines haven&#39;t changed appreciably for 6mo. to a year, it will be much easier for russian propaganda/shills in the west to convince the peoples of the west that this whole thing is just a drain on the tax base.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimate victory will be determined by continued western support vs. russian resilience. Because Putin is determined to come out of this with something that looks like a victory, he is willing to set his own country back 50+ years if that&#39;s what it takes for the rest of the world to lose interest. In his view, in 200 years, everyone will forget about this conflict and the russian economy will have recovered, except now it has more land, a secure warm-water port, and more natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>In grand scheme of things, though, Putin horribly overplayed his hand. Best case scenario is that he&#39;ll end up with what he already effectively had - crimea and LDPR, and <em>maybe</em> a southern bridge to crimea. He&#39;ll have tanked the russian economy for essentially very little in return.</p>\n</div>",

Human minds don't work that way: we easily form fenced-off epistemic communities that downplay our shameful fears and play up our pride. You can even see this reading the reports of US decision-making throughout the Cold War, when interservice rivalry ran hot and the USAF nuclear strategy advisors were giving opinions  based not on what was in humanity's interests or even the USA's, but instead what would get them the most planes and status compared to the army and navy. And of course, you can see it easily here on reddit, hopping between different subreddits.\n\n(What about people like Girkin? Well, he's a doomer, and an outsider, and his criticisms are mostly quite careful. As far as I've noticed, he talks about the conduct of the war, not the wisdom in initiating it in the first place; or he says that Russia should be more committed, without once questioning whether it is winnable even with full commitment.)\n\nGiven all the above, I think a useful and necessary starting point for understanding Russia's position is to try to imagine what your view would be if Russia's strategic situation was a lot better than you currently think it is (this is one reason why contrarian posters like Glideer are valuable to any subreddit that takes itself intellectually seriously). Maybe you're confident that Ukrainian morale is weak. Maybe you think that the EU is less united than it appears, and winter will be hard. Maybe you think that the United States is being opportunistic and will  drop Ukraine without looking back if the conflicts starts to go Russia's way. Above all, you're probably convinced that there won't be another breakthrough like in Kharkiv oblast: that was a one off, heads have rolled, and now discipline and morale have been restored to the troops. Reinforcements are coming in, Iran is sending useful drones, and the forthcoming referenda will encourage a surge of volunteers from the DPR and LPR.\n\nLet's say that you, like Putin, were in the grip of this relative sunny outlook. What would follow for your reflections on the wider strategy of the conflict? Above all, I think you would be aiming to take the long view of things, because the fundamentals are on your side. Forget today's battles and next week's offensives - focus on longer-term military-industrial capacity, and its associated active measures in the Russian and foreign populations. You probably don't want to risk a general mobilisation - that might compromise your longer-term war fighting ability, but you want to get as many new volunteers as possible, ideally from less economically active areas of the country. And finally, nuclear weapons wouldn't be on the table; after all, you're *winning* this war, albeit more slowly and less gloriously than you'd hoped. Why would you risk alienating friends and allies and giving NATO a chance to intervene?\n\nBut you might ask, at what point does this Pollyanna-Putin outlook begin to crumble? When does the filter bubble burst, and Putin has his *Downfall*\\-style meltdown? When Ukraine liberates Kherson? Lysychansk? Donetsk? *Sevastopol*? I think the only answer we can give here is that people in general are very bad at facing up to uncomfortable realities, and can keep themselves from accepting painful truths for their entire lives if necessary. Or think of psychologist's [Leon Festinger's now famous work on cognitive dissonance on doomsday cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails):  when the doomsday prophecy fails, people will go to great lengths to avoid accepting that they've been duped. I expect Putin to go out the same way, with his final thoughts being confidence that Russia can still be victorious.\n\nIn any case, that is my best attempt at figuring out the Kremlin's outlook.

Having these in a warehouse outside St Petersburg is not the same as having those things at a front under active supply interdiction. \n\nThey're having trouble keeping their 100k contrakti supplied with those things..... add another 100k mobilised troops .... and they have to move twice as much.

They have only one rail line to the Northern front, two into the Donbas front and two into the Southern front. Everything has to come over them + trucks for the last 10-100km. All of that with HIMARS knocking out the links and warehouses.\n\nIf all they can push over them is enough to supply a 100k army, and they put 200k troops there, then they're going to have to undersupply the *good troops* as well as the new *poor troops*.\n\n^^* (although, I will add they do also seem to be running short of equipment as well.... and may well run out of BMP-1's, T-62s and other Heavy Weapons.... as we can see from the fact they are using all these very old vaariants *now* to keep the contrakti in equipment.

We also have reports of it often being TDF units that broke in Russian offensives where they did achieve some sort of breakthrough.

Training existing LNR/DNR troops means pulling them off defensible positions and leaving holes in defense lines. Also, poorly motivated troops will have below-average performance no matter the training (see Russian Army in this war, or Afghan Army)\n\n2.

He claims there are 25 million men that fill all that criteria, which is just patently insane. Then he says 300k will be called up from that group. I heavily doubt there are even 300k reservists with specialist skills, combat experience, and are under the age of 40.</p>\n\n<p>And after all that, the resulting Russian army would *still* be outnumbered by the Ukrainians. Russia has deployed around 270-300k troops to Ukraine total, of which 80-100k have already been killed/wounded. Therefore they&#39;re looking at a total pool of 600k vs approx 700k Ukrainians.</p>\n</div>",

Men can leave country if:\n\n* they are ineligible for service due to age\n* ineligible for service due to medical conditions\n* students of universities in other countries\n* freight drivers, railroad workers etcetc\n* have a kid under 3 yo, or two under 14 yo\n* members of national sport teams heading to competitions, artists in some cases etc (remember Eurovision for example)\n\nThis list was probably expanded over summer, haven't checked recently. One caveat is that you need to have documents certifying you are in one of the allowed categories, and for medical conditions you need a result of army medical commission. Nobody bothered to register their medical condition in peacetime, and now an ineligible person seeking confirmation of ineligibility would get lowest priority as staffing the army takes precedence, even if it's something obvious like missing a leg.\n\nAnd finally, there are degrees of ineligibility - you may be ineligible in peacetime, but partially eligible (meaning you can only be drafted into certain limited roles) during war - this category can't leave as well.\n\nThere are some musings in the parliament to allow even eligible men to temporarily leave the country in exchange to either depositing a certain sum of money into ESCROW to guarantee your return, or \"voluntary\" donation to AFU, but this hasn't gone anywhere yet.",

Which is 30% of our yearly consumption. And we won\u2019t be filling storage during winter. We will be fine. Go short on gas.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

People on average want stability, combined with enforced ignorance by Russia on the occupied territories and carpet bombing style  propaganda  this can result in some unexpected (to an informed outsider) takes.</p>\n</div>",

According to the [ZOiS 2019 poll](https://www.zois-berlin.de/en/press/press-releases/donbas-majority-wants-dnr/lnr-to-be-part-of-ukraine), 45% of LDNR residents wanted to reintegrate Ukraine (either as pre-2014 or with special autonomy status), while 45% wanted to join Russia. After this, it's unlikely that Ukraine will ever accept to give a special autonomy status (at least, not the one pushed for by Moscow pre-24/2, which implied they'd have a veto on joining NATO or the EU), and only 23.5% were willing to rejoin Ukraine without such a status in 2019. Also, other polls give much lower support for reintegrating Ukraine (around 12%), and show 50%+ want to join Russia. This [Washington Post survey](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ziGrKC12aJUJ:https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/15/russia-ukraine-donbas-donetsk-luhansk-public-opinion/&cd=13&hl=fr&ct=clnk&gl=fr) explains that there is a huge difference in how people respond based on if the call comes from a Russian or Ukrainian telephone number. When talking to an Ukrainian, LDNR residents claim they are more favourable to integrating Ukraine, and the other way round. So, if it was 21/2 and Ukraine was unwilling to give a special status, it looks like at least 75% of the local population would be against reintegration.\n\nThis can be contrasted with government controlled Donbas region, where less than 5% are favourable to the republics joining Russia (ZOiS 2019).\n\nMy opinion : I think a lot of it will also depend on their view of the war; do they believe Russia is truly protecting them here? Will they have a soured view of the republics/Russia following the forced mobilization and high casualty rates among LDNR mobilised troops (or the fact that they were underequipped and treated as cannon fodder by Russia)? Or on the contrary, will they blame Ukraine for LDNR deaths, and for attacks on the LDNR more generally? Will Russia's general poor performance and Ukraine's surprisingly good performance play an important role in their view?\n\nIt still seems like there is a big risk, but it will also be compounded by whether or not they believe a Russian return is possible after UAF take control; would be partisans won't be as willing to risk their lives if they feel it is in vain, so if Russia doesn't get any meaningful success or seems unwilling to reengage, risks will probably fall. Similarly, I think the longer Ukraine controls these lands and the more Ukrainian control will become an accepted fact, a lot of the Russian fearmongering about ethnic cleansing etc. will lose its bite (it's already quite low, following 8 years of relative normalcy for their Russian-speaking friends and family on the other side of the frontline), while Russian propaganda will lose its hold (unless violent counter-insurgency in the early stages sours relations and creates trauma which allows to unite against UAF).\n\nAnother factor will probably be the economy. On one hand, a severely sanctioned Russia will probably no longer be able to direct as much funds to the LDNR in any case. On the other, Ukraine was already poor and is going to be even poorer at the end of the war and it's unlikely the West's promised financial support will be sufficient, at least in the immediate months, to guarantee any kind of return to normalcy. So if you end up with a mix of resentment, poverty and unemployment following Ukraine taking the territory, it does seem like a recipe for problems.",

I see 4 options:\n\n1. We do nothing. Our support for Ukraine continues and perhaps increases, but we don't change our military posture beyond taking precautions.\n\n2. NATO air and naval forces engage Russian ones in a conventional manner over Ukraine. This does carry the risk of further nuclear strikes, especially in NATO states with air bases.\n\n3. NATO responds in kind by destroying the Kherson bridgehead. Russia will likely respond in kind, setting off the typical nuclear wargames we've likely all seen.\n\n4. First strike mass launch against Russia and total global thermonuclear war. \n\nI'll also discount two impossibilities: that the west will kowtow to nuclear aggression and surrender, or that we will start supporting the SMO/war. Putin definitely won't automatically win the war with his scheme. \n\nBut let's go back to my four options. Every single one save the first carries the risk of total nuclear war. And if we go with the first option, and Kyiv doesn't surrender (they wouldn't) and they get struck again: what next? The same four options present themselves. And if we go with 1) a second time, it might be the last before a Ukrainian surrender. Given how much of a high stakes gambler he's been recently, this may also be Putin's thinking. But it's insanely risky not just for himself but the world.\n\nWhat then, should be done? I see one way out, but it's risky. We declare Ukraine a non-nuclear zone. The deployment of any nuclear warhead against Ukraine will be matched in kind. The difference here is NATO is proactive, not reactive. Putin will know the MAD cost and likely, hopefully, not actually risk it. Right now, the NATO line is unclear. Yes, NATO has said a proportional response, but that should be stated more clearly and unequivocally. The risk here is having to commit to that. It's one thing to promise a thing in the blissful state before nuclear war. It's another to have to live through that apocalypse.\n\nLastly: yes. Nuclear war would be bad. Even without radiation, you are blipping major supply and transit hubs that feed massive populations in Europe and America, to say nothing of importers in the global south. It would be the sort of event that would take centuries to recover from, something your descendants will have to cope with, in ways we can't possibly imagine.
