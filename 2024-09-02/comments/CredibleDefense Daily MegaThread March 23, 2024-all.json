It shattered the illusion of security in Moscow that Putin has sought to cultivate in the more than two years since he invaded Ukraine.\n\n>Islamist groups have targeted Russia in the past citing what they call anti-Muslim policies by the Kremlin. The seizure of a school in Beslan in the south of the country led to more than 380 fatalities in 2004. In 2010, twin suicide attacks in Moscow subway stations killed at least 40, while a suicide bombing killed 16, including the attacker, in the St. Petersburg subway in 2017.\n\nTwo things seem very unlikely, at least at this juncture; a false flag, and Ukrainian involvement.",

It shattered the illusion of security in Moscow that Putin has sought to cultivate in the more than two years since he invaded Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Islamist groups have targeted Russia in the past citing what they call anti-Muslim policies by the Kremlin. The seizure of a school in Beslan in the south of the country led to more than 380 fatalities in 2004. In 2010, twin suicide attacks in Moscow subway stations killed at least 40, while a suicide bombing killed 16, including the attacker, in the St. Petersburg subway in 2017.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two things seem very unlikely, at least at this juncture; a false flag, and Ukrainian involvement.</p>\n</div>",

From what I can remember, the 1.5M claim is from extrapolating out an old [BAE record from 2013 where they managed to produce 600 shells a day](https://x.com/cameron19460429/status/1734021759983083969?s=46&t=5_s-IC0w5kqXJ9NTqKB3nQ) and factoring in maintenance schedules to come up with the 16K figure. This was then multiplied by 8 due to the announcement from BAE Systems last year that they\u2019d increase production eightfold by 2025 which gives you a figure of around 1.5M a year.\n\nThough, in my discussion with a fellow Redditor here, I believe we came to the conclusion using some paper napkin maths that their quota of around 16K a month was a little optimistic as we doubted that taking a record-breaking figure, at least at the time, and extrapolating that out for an entire month was representative of actual capabilities.

[Here is an article](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/05/09/islamic-state-afghanistan-khorasan-propaganda-russia-ukraine-war/):\n\n> Russia is a familiar enemy for Sunni jihadists and has found itself in the crosshairs of IS-K for several reasons. According to IS-K, Moscow\u2019s hands are covered in Muslim blood, especially in Afghanistan, where the legacy of the decade-long Soviet-Afghan War still looms large. IS-K narratives frequently point to Russia\u2019s historical entanglement in Afghanistan and current relations with the Taliban, highlighting Moscow\u2019s lobbying of the Taliban to gain access to Afghanistan, while in return, the Taliban hopes to acquire international recognition and support.\n\n> The first IS-K message mentioning Ukraine was published by the group on March 10, 2022, just two weeks after the conflict kicked off. The statement, issued in the wake of a devastating attack carried out by the group against a Shiite shrine in Peshawar, Pakistan, briefly mentioned the war in Ukraine in the last section of the text. But the mention was an important one, warning Muslims fighting on both sides that participating in the conflict does not equate to participating in jihad. This way, IS-K aims at delegitimizing other jihadist organizations\u2019 struggles as un-Islamic, thus sanctioning only its own war for those who consider themselves true believers.\n\n>On Aug. 3, 2022, IS-K published an issue of its flagship English language Voice of Khurasan magazine featuring an article titled \u201cThe Black Hole in Ukraine,\u201d which celebrated the war as \u201ca great, tremendous glad tiding for the Muslims worldwide.\u201d The \u201cwar erupting among the kuffar [nonbelievers]\u201d is, in IS-K\u2019s view, a \u201cgreat sign from Allah the Almighty.\u201d Speaking on the two great powers, the United States and Russia, fighting a proxy war, IS-K asserted, \u201cAmerica has been a furious enemy of Islam throughout the last century, and Russia has proven no different.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been prepping for this for a long time and remember that the Russians *just* arrested a cell this month which was [apparently going to target a synagogue](https://asiaplustj.info/en/news/world/20240311/russia-says-it-neutralized-is-k-cell-plotting-attack-on-synagogue-in-moscow).\n\nThere is so much doubt, so much mudslinging, so much misinformation about things, with everyone doubting that the Islamic State is capable of such attacks. Of course they\u2019re capable of such attacks! We\u2019ve been worried about this sort of attack since the withdrawal of the US from Afghanistan and the lack of counterinsurgency pressure on IS-K as a result.\n\nThey\u2019ve have two and a half years to plan and then implement these plans. This paired with a large regional war in Europe and the proliferation of firearms throughout Russia as a result has created a situation where such an assault can be carried out. To me, this is a massive, massive SIGINT failure on the part of the FSB/GRU. Even with American warnings, they were unable to disrupt this attack. This potentially means that after the synagogue cell bust they believed they were in the clear.\n\nDespite the claims that these are Slavs or that this is some false flag or some other wild claim, Occam\u2019s Razor suggests that it is indeed the Islamic State - Khorosan Province, and IS-K has claimed as much.\n\nOne last thought.
