It includes some details on exactly what types of missiles are used in each attack.  Including several Kh-31P anti-radar missiles during each massive attack was noteworthy to me.  (Bolded emphasis mine)\n\nIt will be very interesting to see where the air war goes in 2024.  I think it will be the most dynamic area of the conflict.  \n\n[\u200bRussia Modernizes Cruise Missiles and Intensifies Aerial Warfare in Ukrainian Skies | Defense Express | January 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/russia_modernizes_cruise_missiles_and_intensifies_aerial_warfare_in_ukrainian_skies-9198.html)\n\n*Russian invaders launched massive terrorist attacks throughout Ukraine at the end of 2023 and in early 2024. Terrorists launched the most massive strike in the history of Russia-Ukraine war in terms of number of air assets on December 29, 2023. Terrorists launched combined strikes using various weapons as well as massively utilized ballistic missiles.*\n\n*[The Kiev Security Forum](https://ksf.openukraine.org/en) highlighted the most important facts in Russian tactics:*\n\n*In particular, Russians use the tactic of depleting Ukrainian air defense. Due to the fact that terrorists launch a large number of high-speed missiles, Defenders of Ukraine spend a large number of anti-aircraft missiles. The most harmful attacks were made by high-speed Russian missiles (the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic air-launched ballistic missile, the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, anti-aircraft missiles from S-300/400 systems as well as the Kh-22 cruise missiles), as Ukraine may spend 3 or more antimissiles for each of targets. There were simultaneous launches of 5 or even 10 the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile.*\n\n**The KSF believes that Russia's goal is to wear and physically destroy Ukrainian air defense down. The fact, that occupiers also launched several Kh-31P anti-radar missiles during each massive attack in recent weeks was unnoticed. This is a special weapon for destroying radar-based air defense systems (from tactical Gepard anti-aircraft self-propelled system to the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system), which is difficult to shoot down due to its supersonic speed. It is not yet known whether these particular launches were effective.**\n\n*At the same time, quite a lot of high-speed missiles attacked targets beyond Kyiv. The KSF believes that this is a problem because modern missile defense systems are focused on protecting the capital of Ukraine - Kyiv. Time that it takes Russian missiles to reach such cities as Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kryvyi Rih, and Dnipro is critically short (2-5 minutes). Ukrainian air defense would not have time to react even with a sufficient number of missile launchers. In addition, these areas are also attacked by slow-movingShahed kamikaze drones.*\n\n*The KSF also assures that effectiveness of Russian strikes is ambiguous. Open sources reveal a dozen cases where Russian missiles exploded on the ground in residential or non-developed areas, causing damage which is incommensurable to the value of missile. This can be explained either by a missile blunder or its successful interception, or by purposeful terror against civilians. In any case, the main result of Russian attacks was not destruction of specific targets, but depletion of Ukrainian air defense.*\n\n*Despite this huge superiority in the skies, Russia is still working to accelerate modernization of its air weapon. The question is about about long-range missiles and drones, as well as occupiers` tactical means:*\n\n    \n\u25cf The use of a large number of the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile and a still unknown type of ballistic missiles (probably North Korean).\n\n\u25cf The Kh-101 cruise missiles now have an air defense jamming system and, presumably, a new navigation system.\n\n\u25cf There were reports of appearance of a jet version of the Shahed kamikaze drones.\n\n\u25cf The Lancet loitering munition as well as FPV drones allegedly already use elements of artificial intelligence.\n\nAs a result, Ukraine's militaries as well as defense industry must quickly adapt to new threats.\n\nIn its turn, Ukraine also launches air counterattacks:\n\n\u25cf Massive drone attacks (more than 30 UAVs at a time) had hit targets in Russia and occupied Crimea for the first time since summer.\n\n\u25cf Attacks on military facilities in Belgorod Oblast by Soviet and Ukrainian MLRS missiles.\n\n\u25cf Successful surgical strikes on Crimea as well as occupied Donetsk Oblast with Western cruise missiles.\n\n*The KSF noted that, on the one hand, a relocation of the war to the aggressor's territory should be the main element of Ukraine's new military strategy. In particular, Western experts often talk about this. Such transfer is impossible without massive air strikes and geospatial intelligence.*\n\n*On the other hand, Ukraine must significantly increase the production of its own air and anti-aircraft weapons such as attack and anti-aircraft missiles, all kinds of drones, radars as well as electronic warfare equipment. This is necessary both to hit targets on Russian territory and to compensate delays in provision of Western weapons.*\n\n*In particular, the spokesman for the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Yuriy Ihnat, has recently emphasized that it was impossible to shoot down all the S-300 missiles that Russians launch at Kharkiv. Instead missile launchers should be destroyed on the territory of Russia (where it is still forbidden to hit with Western missiles).*\n\n*Therefore, massive attacks on military targets in Russia should not be a forced \"response\" to the shelling of Ukrainian cities, but a regular proactive tactic of Ukraine. According to the KSF, the Ukrainian government as well as the defense industry must create a sufficient, increasingly modern arsenal of weapons for such strikes.*",

        "body": "I want to bring up an issue that will be increasingly important in the future: new Ukrainian trenches and fortifications. Over the past few months more and more rumours, news, photos, videos, etc. have been coming out about the fact that Ukraine is starting to build fortifications both in the area of the state border with Russia (Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv Oblasts) and in the rear of the current front line in the rest of the country (as well in the border with Belarus). Anecdotally, I have read from Ukrainians that numerous trucks are seen over the country carrying logs and prefabricated concrete structures. The Russians have reported (so let's take that with a grain of salt, but it could be true) that concrete batching plants near the front line have been very active lately. Also, Russian sources report of continued Ukrainian activities in fortifications construction for instance in the Selydove area, located 30 kms west of Avdiivka and about 25 kms from the front line in Pervomaiske. I consider these efforts to be very smart - to avoid potential problems in the future, imho, a set of fortifications should be built at a distance of 15 to 30 kms from the current front line, making the best use of the topography of the area and eventual natural barriers. In the event of significant Russian advances in a sector, this will make it possible to avoid much more serious problems, and above all, which is even more useful in the current framework, it will allow positions to be defended with the least possible loss of life of Ukrainian soldiers and could also decrease, in certain contexts, the use of artillery fire necessary to defend a position, making the most of the terrain. At the same time, anti-drone protections must be added to the trenches, their living comfort must be increased - this will allow to improve the perception people have about trench warfare.\n\nI recommend reading this entire [thread](https://nitter.net/JohnH105/status/1730598232839815501), where lots of photos as well as sources on fortification work are posted, as well as reading the Kyiv Independent's article linked there. I also point out that Metinvest seems to have increased production of these [capsules](https://nitter.net/UkrReview/status/1743917407222063575), which will have the role of housing soldiers in the trenches, both for sleeping and for shelter during shelling.\n\nDeepState explored this topic on several occasions during January. (Translation with DeepL)\n\nAn update on construction.\n\n>\ud83d\udea9 The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to build up fortifications on the northern border\n\n>\u2757\ufe0f This was stated by Serhiy Nayev, Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that in recent months, fortification equipment has been increased by 63% in the Northern Operational Zone.\n\n>\ud83d\udc65 \"The defence forces are proactive. We are increasing the number and effectiveness of mobile air defence firing groups, and counter-sabotage work is underway. But the main thing is that we are building defensive lines and creating a powerful system of engineering barriers,\" said Serhii Naiev.\n\n>\ud83d\udd0d The commander also said that, if necessary, combat brigades would be ready to arrive at the border to repel an attack. The new fortifications are capable of holding back the attack of at least a battalion, and the entire defensive strip can provide defence against much larger forces.\n\n\n\nHere it is written about important government allocations for new fortifications.\n\n>\ud83d\udea9 The Cabinet of Ministers has allocated additional funding of UAH 2.5 billion for the construction of engineering and fortification structures \n\n>\ud83d\udc65 This was announced by the Prime Minister of Ukraine at a government meeting:\n\n>\"The key task for us this year is to strengthen our defence capabilities. In this context, we have two important decisions today. We are allocating an additional almost UAH 2.5 billion from the reserve fund for the construction of engineering and fortification structures. From the allocated funds: 1.4 billion UAH - for fortification equipment of defence borders; 1.1 billion UAH - for the arrangement of non-explosive barriers; from the reserve fund - UAH 120 million for the State Border Guard Service.\n\n>\ud83d\udc65 An important initiative from the government to build the IFS [engineering and fortification structures]. We hope that similar funding will be provided in the future, and we also hope that these funds will actually be used to build defence and fortification structures both along the border and in the war zone. There was also a good practice of recruiting people to build defensive structures from the Frankivsk Military Civil Administration, which we would like to see in other communities.\n\n\n\nHere it's written that there is still a lot of progress to be made, because the construction of fortifications is ostracized as it is seen as an admission of having lost the initiative. As for the frontline trenches, well, it's indeed difficult to improve them right now for obvious reasons. Today even working at night is hard because of drones with thermal cameras.\n\n> [...]\n\n>\ud83d\uddc2 Analytical note. In November, we wrote that we had noticed improvements in the preparation of engineering fortifications, but unfortunately, the action was a one-off. The negligent attitude to the IFS continues. Even in the most threatening areas, where the enemy has a chance to enter the operational space, the defence system leaves much to be desired. The IFS is the life of our fighters, so if these words provoke inspections and bring to justice those who were supposed to provide defence and did not, it will be a big step forward.\n\n>\ud83d\udea9 Going back to the experience of the First World War, we encounter a similar problem in the British army: the British didn't dig trenches, they had to attack, and the top leadership considered trench warfare to be a temporary state. They could not admit that the war had reached a stalemate, so the Entente trenches were made in a hurry. Creating a system of trenches would be an admission of defeat...\n\n\n\nRussian trenches are praised here. If there is one thing Ukrainians have no problem recognizing, it's the Russians' ability to dig trenches. Both in quantity and quality. \n\n>\ud83d\udea9 Commander of the 3rd Brigade Engineer Battalion shared footage of Katsaps demonstrating their defensive fortifications\n\n>\ud83d\udcf9The video shows the following elements of the IFS: \n>- an extensive trench system, hundreds of metres long, up to 2 metres deep and up to 1.5 metres wide, which allows free movement and easy passage of two soldiers in equipment;\n>- completely blocked passageways, which allows to move covertly, including from thermal imaging devices (which means protection against discharges and FPV), as well as to maintain a stable air temperature and its own microclimate;\n>- a drainage system that prevents water flooding and the formation of impassable swamps during the rainy season;\n>- prepared for firing and camouflaged positions for shooters;\n>- electrified covered dugouts equipped for personnel accommodation;\n>- individual foxhole shelters along the entire length of the trench connections, which allows soldiers to hide if they are caught in the middle of a shelling attack;\n>- wooden structures of high quality.\n\n>\"We need to pay great attention to the IFS and move towards surpassing the enemy, because defence is an important part of our Defence Forces today. If the person who is supposed to control this area at the positions is not held accountable, we will continue to discuss the defence of various settlements, adding the label \"fortress\" to their names until they are completely destroyed. \n\n>\ud83d\udc64 The fighters themselves share their observations about the enemy:\n\n>\"When the Muscovites occupy any positions, they immediately start digging, chopping, working with saws and construction equipment. They pay a lot of attention to building defensive fortifications and devote a lot of resources to it. Moreover, they have people who are engaged solely in digging trenches, equipping them, etc., and not like our soldiers, who storm and build and take care of all other issues.\n\n>\u27a1Similar fortifications have been in place since the ATO in Donbas and in the northern part of the country during the full-scale war.\n\n\n\nIt must be said, however, that the Russians over the last year used civilian contract personnel, including from Central Asia, to help with the works of the Surovikin Line. Ukrainian soldiers complain that they have no available personnel to dig in the rear, understandably. In other historical times civilians (or POWs) would have been rounded up and forced to dig, but today the world (at least Ukraine) is less harsh and the first local governments are beginning to fund and organize the voluntary recruitment of civilian workers to build fortifications. Great idea and I hope more will follow.\n\n>\ud83d\udea9 Cis-Carpathians [residents of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast] are called to help with the construction of fortifications in Donetsk region\n\n>\ud83d\udd25 A very good initiative from the Frankivsk Military-Civilian Administration. It would be great if other communities joined this initiative\n\n>\ud83e\uddf1 In Prykarpattia, they are looking for people to help with the construction of fortifications in the Donetsk region. A total of 300 people are needed. The salary will be 20 thousand hryvnias. In addition, people will be provided with accommodation and meals. Those who agree to help with the construction of defence structures will receive a deferral from conscription for the period of construction.",

Both in quantity and quality. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\ud83d\udea9 Commander of the 3rd Brigade Engineer Battalion shared footage of Katsaps demonstrating their defensive fortifications</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcf9The video shows the following elements of the IFS: \n- an extensive trench system, hundreds of metres long, up to 2 metres deep and up to 1.5 metres wide, which allows free movement and easy passage of two soldiers in equipment;\n- completely blocked passageways, which allows to move covertly, including from thermal imaging devices (which means protection against discharges and FPV), as well as to maintain a stable air temperature and its own microclimate;\n- a drainage system that prevents water flooding and the formation of impassable swamps during the rainy season;\n- prepared for firing and camouflaged positions for shooters;\n- electrified covered dugouts equipped for personnel accommodation;\n- individual foxhole shelters along the entire length of the trench connections, which allows soldiers to hide if they are caught in the middle of a shelling attack;\n- wooden structures of high quality.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We need to pay great attention to the IFS and move towards surpassing the enemy, because defence is an important part of our Defence Forces today. If the person who is supposed to control this area at the positions is not held accountable, we will continue to discuss the defence of various settlements, adding the label &quot;fortress&quot; to their names until they are completely destroyed. </p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc64 The fighters themselves share their observations about the enemy:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When the Muscovites occupy any positions, they immediately start digging, chopping, working with saws and construction equipment. They pay a lot of attention to building defensive fortifications and devote a lot of resources to it. Moreover, they have people who are engaged solely in digging trenches, equipping them, etc., and not like our soldiers, who storm and build and take care of all other issues.</p>\n\n<p>\u27a1Similar fortifications have been in place since the ATO in Donbas and in the northern part of the country during the full-scale war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It must be said, however, that the Russians over the last year used civilian contract personnel, including from Central Asia, to help with the works of the Surovikin Line. Ukrainian soldiers complain that they have no available personnel to dig in the rear, understandably. In other historical times civilians (or POWs) would have been rounded up and forced to dig, but today the world (at least Ukraine) is less harsh and the first local governments are beginning to fund and organize the voluntary recruitment of civilian workers to build fortifications. Great idea and I hope more will follow.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\ud83d\udea9 Cis-Carpathians [residents of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast] are called to help with the construction of fortifications in Donetsk region</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 A very good initiative from the Frankivsk Military-Civilian Administration. It would be great if other communities joined this initiative</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddf1 In Prykarpattia, they are looking for people to help with the construction of fortifications in the Donetsk region. A total of 300 people are needed. The salary will be 20 thousand hryvnias. In addition, people will be provided with accommodation and meals. Those who agree to help with the construction of defence structures will receive a deferral from conscription for the period of construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

        "body": "Yesterday, and the day before, there was some talk about [this analysis](https://www.38north.org/2024/01/north-koreas-new-unification-policy-implications-and-pitfalls/) by 38north which cautioned that Kim Jong Un's administration may have decided to pivot their strategy towards open military confrontation with South Korea in an unspecified, but no longer purely hypothetical timeframe.\n\nI don't know enough about North Korean political discourse and about its post-1992 foreign policy to offer any useful insight on that analysis, but in one of the megathread comments I mentioned that the rhetoric of governments like those of North Korea is a very slippery indicator of policy. Public discourse has a poor history of matching military plans and the disposition of troops. Unfortunately, it is equally true that it often does not match military plans and the dispotiion of troops right up until it does, hence its fickleness.\n\nIn case anyone's interested about this, I'd like to mention a couple of useful sources on this topic. They are all about Soviet political discourse, so I'd caution against drawing too detailed a parallel between what the North Korean administration does now and what these sources discuss, but they may offer some useful perspective. I can't link to them, as they all predate modern preprint practices but PDFs of all of them are easily available. If you can't get them via an academic subscription or something, you can find them on that site I won't name but you know the one, where we go give Elsevier the middle finger when they want half a kidney for a thirty year-old paper that may not even be what you're looking for.\n\nB. Thomas Strout discusses the relation between political discourse and governments' efforts to establish legitimacy in a paper called *Rhetoric Revisited: Political Legitimation and the Cold War*. The most relevant point he makes for the present discussion, I think, is this one:\n\n> The presence of the domestic component means that enunciated foreign policy has a national as well as an international audience. Thus, though foreign and domestic factors appear to the foreign policy organization as separate influences, these influences are comprised by a single policy environment. And that characteristic is a key aspect of the part which legitimation plays in the foreign policy process.\n\nStrout mentions several examples (out of a veritable smorgasbord, if you've ever seen primary sources from that period) of formally contradictory rhetoric in the early days of the Cold War. Rhetoric at every level, from regional newspapers to Stalin himself, was entirely contradictory on whether a war between the communist and capitalist was imminent or beyond the realm of possibility in the near term.\n\nStrout believes that foreign and domestic policy are both relevant to a domestic audience, and that they are both some of the elements that define the overall image of the state and its government which authorities seek to develop and to impose as legitimate, and that this image is developed both through action and through a conscious effort of political discourse. Thus, in his opinion, the apparently contradictory nature of this rhetoric was, if not solely, at least primarily, a manifestation of the inherent fickleness of public discourse.\n\nThemes of war and mass mobilization abounded in Marxist-Leninist jargon at the time and were frequently used not specifically in order to discuss the possibility of immediate military confrontation but in order to contextualize or emphasize the irreconciliable differences between the two systems, and explain why socialism will come out on top. This was a key piece of discourse seeking to legitimize the position of the Soviet government, both at home and abroad. While it was indicative of foreign policy in general (specifically, of the adversarial nature between the two \"camps\" and, of course, about the very literal possibility of open military confrontation) it was not specifically indicative of Soviet willingness to begin military confrontation.\n\nIn the author's own words:\n\n> The image employed in support of policy may represent a commitment also far removed from the operational environment of policy. Based on the political use of the image, it is clear that the analysis of policy formulation then involves more than comparing an image of policy with some objectively determined reality or measuring the bases of policy against its outcome. Ample evidence exists to support the proposition that policy may be conceived, articulated, and perpetuated on the basis of an image which has no conformance to \"objective\" reality. But, in that instance, the image itself is a reality which may exercise constraints on policy. Thus, the symbols available for legitimation may act to constrain as well as to promote [specific policy].\n\nIn *Integrative Complexity of American and Soviet Foreign Policy Rhetoric: A Time-Series Analysis*, Philip Tetlock makes an analysis of some quantitative parameters of Soviet and American discourse. The analysis itself is quite technical and I'm somewhat skeptical of analyses like these.\n\nBut I'm bringing it up because it illustrates the inherent difficulty of trying to guess underlying mechanisms from indicators of public discourse.\n\nOne of the problems discussed in Tetlock's paper is why a shift in complexity seemed to precede Soviet discourse, but appeared to be simultaneous with American initiatives. One hypothesis was that the Soviet policy of opportunistic action inherently resulted in considerable deliberation and, if not consensus building as we understand it in Western democracies, at least the establishment of consensus. Another hypothesis was that changes in the complexity of discourse was simply correlated with changes in influence of the various parties in Soviet leadership, and that the influence of competitive policy makers inherently translated as a perceived decrease in integrative complexity (a topic that Tetlock explores in another article from 1989, *Cognitive and Rhetorical Styles of Traditionalist and Reformist Soviet Politicians: A Content Analysis Study*)\n\nNeither explanation was sufficient. The former is built on a somewhat shaky historical basis, and the latter did not sufficiently explain the parameters of American discourse related to initiatives outside those of immediate Soviet threats to Western spheres of influence. Ultimately, shifts in integrative complexity turned out to be a useful tool for putting some historical events in principle, but without an understanding of their underlying mechanisms, they're poor immediate indicators.\n\nFinally, in *The Role of Political Rhetoric in the Development of Soviet Totalitarian Language*, Andreas Ventzel investigates one of the many paradoxes of totalitarian discourse: despite its rigid form, the discourse of totalitarian governments is surprisingly ambiguous. In the author's own words, he illustrates that, despite its outwardly scientific-like form,\n\n> [totalitarian discourse] it is not in fact describable by a rigid connection between the signifiers and the signified, and that the semantic distinctiveness of words in the communicative function is compensated by the precise determination of their location in the axiological good-bad axis.\n\nI know that none of these sources provide much additional clarity on current developments. They cannot: everyone's crystal ball is equally bad. Even direct and naive applications of one hypothesis or another still produce myriads of scenarios. For example, if we take the shift in discourse to be indicative of a shift that has already happened in the distribution of influence among the various factions in North Korean administration, and we are only seeing their version of op-eds now, what are Kim's new favorites arguing for? Are they just tugging at a new angle for their government's image, one that's rooted in North Korean primacy over all-Korean reunification, or favors wider foreign initiative over the narrower, inter-Korean and Korean-American focus of the last three decades? Or are they really arguing for open military confrontation?\n\nAs is often the case with historical perspectives, these can only offer some further useful context and precedent, rather than give anyone magical predictive powers. \n\nThere is one takeaway that none of the papers above state explicitly but which I want to call out: Soviet public discourse and Soviet military posture and action were frequently divergent. Examining just one of them is an interesting exercise but casts very little substantial light on actual policy, it is usually futile to look at the words but not at the tanks and vice-versa.\n\nRobert Carlin and Siegfried Hecker, the authors of the study that prompted all this, aren't preppy IR nerds who play with pet theories on maps of countries they don't know much about. Their alarmist take may just as well be a reaction to the fact that North Korea has shifted its public discourse so dramatically that they simply don't know what to make of it. After all, some of the fundamental elements of North Korean rhetorics have literally gone unchanged for so long that they're older than Carlin's entire career. But they know this region and they have a perspective that's more detailed than your average international relations-theoretic take on things. As I mentioned above, I know too little about modern North Korea to say anything substantial about their analysis, but I would pay attention to what they are saying on the topic.",

For the other, I doubt Korean-Chinese relations have warmed back up to the point where they could coordinate actions against South Korea and Taiwan respectively, and I don't think their Chinese neighbours would be willing to accommodate a North Korean aggression at a point in time where their greatest assets against the 7th Fleet are complacency, indeciseveness, and a false sense of security.\n\nMy gut feeling is that this is Kim shifting the foundation of his foreign policy, from economic relations to geopolitical ambitions of Korean reunification. Instead of seeking a compromise based on multi-party US and Chinese interests in the region, it's trying to get in on the far more effervescent and flexible, if loose, anti-Western coalition. In this case, framing Korean reunification as a move against their common enemy, rather than an intra-Korean affair, makes a little bit of sense and lays the foundation of a convenient diplomatic position if China comes out on top in their struggle for Taiwan. Carlin and Hecker may be right when they say Kim has made up his mind about going to war but the timeframe for that may be a lot longer than what the twitchier language of their post would indicate.",

            "body": "Here\u2019s the article in full without the paywall \n\n> One tunnel in Gaza was wide enough for a top Hamas official to drive a car inside. Another stretched nearly three football fields long and was hidden beneath a hospital. Under the house of a senior Hamas commander, the Israeli military found a spiral staircase leading to a tunnel approximately seven stories deep. \n\n>These details and new information about the tunnels, some made public by the Israeli military and documented by video and photographs, underscore why the tunnels were considered a major threat to the Israeli military in Gaza even before the war started.\n\n>But Israeli officials and soldiers who have since been in the tunnels \u2014 as well as current and former American officials with experience in the region \u2014 say the scope, depth and quality of the tunnels built by Hamas have astonished them. Even some of the machinery that Hamas used to build the tunnels, observed in captured videos, has surprised the Israeli military.\n\n>The Israeli military now believes there are far more tunnels under Gaza. In December, the network was assessed to be an estimated 250 miles. Senior Israeli defense officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, are currently estimating the network is between 350 and 450 miles \u2014 extraordinary figures for a territory that at its longest point is only 25 miles. Two of the officials also assessed there are close to 5,700 separate shafts leading down to the tunnels.\n\n>The numbers could not be independently verified, and there are varying estimates by Israeli officials for the increased scope of the tunnel network, based on different intelligence. But the immense efforts of Hamas to militarize the enclave are not in dispute; nor are the intelligence failures of the Israeli military in underestimating the extent and importance of the network to Hamas\u2019s survival.\n\n>In a meeting in January 2023, a top Israeli military official said the tunnels would not even be a factor in any future war with Hamas because of Israel\u2019s military strength, according to a transcript of the discussion reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n>\u201cHamas has used the time and resources over the last 15 years to turn Gaza into a fortress,\u201d said Aaron Greenstone, a former C.I.A. officer who has worked extensively in the Middle East.\n\n>For the Israeli military, the tunnels are a subterranean nightmare and the core of Hamas\u2019s ability to survive. Every strategic goal of Israel in Gaza is now linked to wiping out the tunnels.\n\n>\u201cIf you want to destroy the leadership and arsenal of Hamas, you have to destroy the tunnels,\u201d said Daphn\u00e9 Richemond-Barak, a tunnel warfare expert at Reichman University in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s become connected to every part of the military missions.\u201d\n\n>Hamas has invested heavily in the tunnels since it does not have the resources or numbers to fight the Israeli military in a conventional war. The group uses the tunnels as military bases and arsenals, and relies on them to move its forces undetected and protect its top commanders.\n\n>One 2022 document showed Hamas budgeted $1 million on the tunnel doors, underground workshops and other expenses in Khan Younis.\n\n>Israeli intelligence officials recently assessed that there were about 100 miles of tunnels just under Khan Younis, southern Gaza\u2019s largest city, where Israeli forces are now in heavy fighting. Yahya Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas in Gaza, had a home in Khan Younis.\n\n>In addition, a 2015 report indicated that Hamas had spent more than $3 million on tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip, including many built under civilian infrastructure and sensitive locations such as schools and hospitals, the Israeli military said.\n\n>The Israeli military said it had found two types of tunnels: ones used by commanders and others used by operatives. The commander tunnels are deeper and more comfortable, allowing for longer stays and use of ceramic tiles. The other tunnels are more spartan and often shallower.\n\n>An Israeli official said the military might have spent a year locating a single tunnel, but now the ground campaign has provided a trove of information about Gaza\u2019s underground network.\n\n>The Israeli military has examined computers used by Hamas operatives in charge of tunnel construction to find the underground passageways, a senior Israeli official said. Some documents captured in the war are also proving vital. The Israeli military has found lists of the families that \u201chosted\u201d the tunnel entrances in their private homes.\n\n>In one case, Israeli soldiers located a map of tunnels in Beit Hanoun, a city in northern Gaza, and used it to find and destroy tunnels. Even with this battlefield intelligence, the fighting in Gaza around the tunnels has been grueling. The Israeli military reports that nearly 190 soldiers have been killed and about 240 seriously wounded since the ground campaign started. But the military has not disclosed the number of dead and wounded in connection with the tunnel warfare.\n\n>One soldier, speaking on the condition of anonymity for safety reasons, said he oversaw the destruction of about 50 tunnels in Beit Hanoun. All of them were booby-trapped, he said. The soldier, an officer in the combat engineers, said his unit had found bombs hidden in walls and a massive explosive device that was hard-wired to be remotely activated.\n\n>The soldier, who was a reservist and has since been discharged, said the device had been made in a factory and had a serial number on it. If it had gone off, the bomb would have killed anybody in the tunnel and directly outside it, he said.\n\n>Hamas released a video in November showing how it lured a group of five Israeli soldiers to a tunnel entrance in Beit Hanoun and then used a roadside bomb to kill the soldiers.\n\n>Ms. Richemond-Barak said Hamas had imported the tactic from Syrian rebels who killed dozens of government troops in a tunnel attack in 2014 in Aleppo.\n\n>On Jan. 8, Israeli soldiers took journalists to see three tunnel shafts in central Gaza \u2014 one inside a one-story farm building on the outskirts of Bureij, the second inside a civilian steelworks on the edge of Maghazi and a third inside a shed near the steelworks.\n\n>The shaft in the steelworks was the deepest and most sophisticated. It descended roughly 30 yards and was fitted with some kind of elevator. The soldiers said it was used to transport munitions parts that were molded in the steelworks. A bucket of shells or rocket heads lay nearby. The soldiers said the shells were based on a template of a yellow U.S.-made mortar shell inscribed with the words \u201c20 mm mortar shell; Lot 1-2008.\u201d\n\n>The soldiers did not allow journalists into the shaft, citing the risk of explosions, but said Hamas would carry the munitions parts into the tunnel to transport them to another part of the tunnel network, where they would be fitted with explosives.\n\n>The tunnel was said to lead to a nearby shed made from corrugated iron. The journalists were escorted to that shed, where they saw 10 large rockets that were roughly three yards long and painted olive green. The rockets were contained in long oblong cages, possibly used to transport them.\n\n>The soldiers said the rockets had a range of roughly 60 miles. A shaft in the floor led underground, but it was unclear where the shaft led to, or how deep it was. It appeared shallower than the first shaft.\n\n>The logo of the Qassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, was stuck to a wall.\n>Later, the Israeli Army published photos and video of the shafts and other nearby facilities. A Times photographer documented the military infrastructure, too.\n>The soldiers also took journalists to see a third tunnel shaft in a one-story farm building in Bureij, roughly a mile to the north, surrounded by farmland. They said the shaft had been hidden behind a locked door, which had been blown off its hinges. The journalists were again not allowed to enter the tunnel.\n\n>Outside, roughly 100 yards away, military bulldozers appeared to have unearthed part of the tunnel leading from the farm building. It was roughly five yards below the surface, arched in shape and wide enough for one person to pass comfortably.\n\n>Hamas has improved its ability to conceal the tunnels, but the senior official said the Israeli military had figured out one of the group\u2019s operating models. The official called it the \u201ctriangle.\u201d Whenever the Israeli military finds a school, a hospital or a mosque, soldiers know they can expect to locate an underground tunnel system beneath them, the official said.\n\n>Destroying the tunnels is not an easy task, the official said. They need to be mapped, checked for hostages and not just damaged but made irreparable. Recent attempts to demolish the tunnels by flooding them with seawater have failed.The official estimated it could take years to disable the tunnel system.",

Senior Israeli defense officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, are currently estimating the network is between 350 and 450 miles \u2014 extraordinary figures for a territory that at its longest point is only 25 miles. Two of the officials also assessed there are close to 5,700 separate shafts leading down to the tunnels.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers could not be independently verified, and there are varying estimates by Israeli officials for the increased scope of the tunnel network, based on different intelligence. But the immense efforts of Hamas to militarize the enclave are not in dispute; nor are the intelligence failures of the Israeli military in underestimating the extent and importance of the network to Hamas\u2019s survival.</p>\n\n<p>In a meeting in January 2023, a top Israeli military official said the tunnels would not even be a factor in any future war with Hamas because of Israel\u2019s military strength, according to a transcript of the discussion reviewed by The New York Times.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHamas has used the time and resources over the last 15 years to turn Gaza into a fortress,\u201d said Aaron Greenstone, a former C.I.A. officer who has worked extensively in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<p>For the Israeli military, the tunnels are a subterranean nightmare and the core of Hamas\u2019s ability to survive. Every strategic goal of Israel in Gaza is now linked to wiping out the tunnels.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you want to destroy the leadership and arsenal of Hamas, you have to destroy the tunnels,\u201d said Daphn\u00e9 Richemond-Barak, a tunnel warfare expert at Reichman University in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s become connected to every part of the military missions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has invested heavily in the tunnels since it does not have the resources or numbers to fight the Israeli military in a conventional war. The group uses the tunnels as military bases and arsenals, and relies on them to move its forces undetected and protect its top commanders.</p>\n\n<p>One 2022 document showed Hamas budgeted $1 million on the tunnel doors, underground workshops and other expenses in Khan Younis.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli intelligence officials recently assessed that there were about 100 miles of tunnels just under Khan Younis, southern Gaza\u2019s largest city, where Israeli forces are now in heavy fighting. Yahya Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas in Gaza, had a home in Khan Younis.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, a 2015 report indicated that Hamas had spent more than $3 million on tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip, including many built under civilian infrastructure and sensitive locations such as schools and hospitals, the Israeli military said.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli military said it had found two types of tunnels: ones used by commanders and others used by operatives. The commander tunnels are deeper and more comfortable, allowing for longer stays and use of ceramic tiles. The other tunnels are more spartan and often shallower.</p>\n\n<p>An Israeli official said the military might have spent a year locating a single tunnel, but now the ground campaign has provided a trove of information about Gaza\u2019s underground network.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli military has examined computers used by Hamas operatives in charge of tunnel construction to find the underground passageways, a senior Israeli official said. Some documents captured in the war are also proving vital. The Israeli military has found lists of the families that \u201chosted\u201d the tunnel entrances in their private homes.</p>\n\n<p>In one case, Israeli soldiers located a map of tunnels in Beit Hanoun, a city in northern Gaza, and used it to find and destroy tunnels. Even with this battlefield intelligence, the fighting in Gaza around the tunnels has been grueling. The Israeli military reports that nearly 190 soldiers have been killed and about 240 seriously wounded since the ground campaign started. But the military has not disclosed the number of dead and wounded in connection with the tunnel warfare.</p>\n\n<p>One soldier, speaking on the condition of anonymity for safety reasons, said he oversaw the destruction of about 50 tunnels in Beit Hanoun. All of them were booby-trapped, he said. The soldier, an officer in the combat engineers, said his unit had found bombs hidden in walls and a massive explosive device that was hard-wired to be remotely activated.</p>\n\n<p>The soldier, who was a reservist and has since been discharged, said the device had been made in a factory and had a serial number on it. If it had gone off, the bomb would have killed anybody in the tunnel and directly outside it, he said.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas released a video in November showing how it lured a group of five Israeli soldiers to a tunnel entrance in Beit Hanoun and then used a roadside bomb to kill the soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Richemond-Barak said Hamas had imported the tactic from Syrian rebels who killed dozens of government troops in a tunnel attack in 2014 in Aleppo.</p>\n\n<p>On Jan. 8, Israeli soldiers took journalists to see three tunnel shafts in central Gaza \u2014 one inside a one-story farm building on the outskirts of Bureij, the second inside a civilian steelworks on the edge of Maghazi and a third inside a shed near the steelworks.</p>\n\n<p>The shaft in the steelworks was the deepest and most sophisticated. It descended roughly 30 yards and was fitted with some kind of elevator. The soldiers said it was used to transport munitions parts that were molded in the steelworks. A bucket of shells or rocket heads lay nearby. The soldiers said the shells were based on a template of a yellow U.S.-made mortar shell inscribed with the words \u201c20 mm mortar shell; Lot 1-2008.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The soldiers did not allow journalists into the shaft, citing the risk of explosions, but said Hamas would carry the munitions parts into the tunnel to transport them to another part of the tunnel network, where they would be fitted with explosives.</p>\n\n<p>The tunnel was said to lead to a nearby shed made from corrugated iron. The journalists were escorted to that shed, where they saw 10 large rockets that were roughly three yards long and painted olive green. The rockets were contained in long oblong cages, possibly used to transport them.</p>\n\n<p>The soldiers said the rockets had a range of roughly 60 miles. A shaft in the floor led underground, but it was unclear where the shaft led to, or how deep it was. It appeared shallower than the first shaft.</p>\n\n<p>The logo of the Qassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, was stuck to a wall.\nLater, the Israeli Army published photos and video of the shafts and other nearby facilities. A Times photographer documented the military infrastructure, too.\nThe soldiers also took journalists to see a third tunnel shaft in a one-story farm building in Bureij, roughly a mile to the north, surrounded by farmland. They said the shaft had been hidden behind a locked door, which had been blown off its hinges. The journalists were again not allowed to enter the tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>Outside, roughly 100 yards away, military bulldozers appeared to have unearthed part of the tunnel leading from the farm building. It was roughly five yards below the surface, arched in shape and wide enough for one person to pass comfortably.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has improved its ability to conceal the tunnels, but the senior official said the Israeli military had figured out one of the group\u2019s operating models. The official called it the \u201ctriangle.\u201d Whenever the Israeli military finds a school, a hospital or a mosque, soldiers know they can expect to locate an underground tunnel system beneath them, the official said.</p>\n\n<p>Destroying the tunnels is not an easy task, the official said. They need to be mapped, checked for hostages and not just damaged but made irreparable. Recent attempts to demolish the tunnels by flooding them with seawater have failed.The official estimated it could take years to disable the tunnel system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It was meant to be viewed by the Israelis. The torture/rape was to humiliate and frighten them. \n\nAdditionally, Israel had never particularly considered the idea of a massive ground incursion from one of its neighboring militant groups and clearly did not have a security concept for such a thing. As far back as April 2023, Palestinian journalists were writing about a possible dual attack from both Hamas/Hezbollah in the nature of the October 7th incursion. I personally think that was always the plan, but it was narrowly avoided by Hamas not notifying Hezbollah for operational security reasons and the timely intervention of the American carriers. \n\nThe on the ground reality is that approximately 80k Israelis have been displaced from the northern border and they cannot return until Hezbollah has been pushed from the border. They generally station their elite al-Radwan Force directly on the border, which has been training in the manner of the Hamas militants prior to October 7th. Simply ending the war and ceasing the rocket fire will not enable them to return, because now they have to consider a ground incursion mixed with a pogrom. And that's not a policy decision, the Israeli people just won't return by personal choice until security is reestablished. \n\nClaiming Netanyahu is attempting to look like \"a strongman\" is a misunderstanding of the situation. Netanyahu is not beholden to the rest of the world, he's beholden to the Israeli people and given current realities the Israeli people are more likely to storm the Knesset and lynch him than return to the north if a ceasefire is declared tonight.",

            "body": "Could go anywhere, but it seems unlikely that Russia changes present course in the near term.\n\nBefore 9/11, Russia had a hostile stance towards west; but it was very weak. After that, the liberal / pro-business factions in Kremlin convinced Putin to switch gears, and they adopted a policy of cozying up to west. It didn't last long, Putin's speeches started to be more hostile in 2005 again, and by 2008 he was blaming west full on again. By ~2012 that rhetoric reached its peak before active hostilities. \n\nI find it quite amusing that a lot of people who argue for NATO expansion being the cause of all this seem to just ignore the ~2000-2006 completely. That's when, among other things Putin said that Ukraine being in NATO is something he doesn't understand but that it's not his business and is for Ukraine(and other states to decide), a time when USA announced that they'll send something like 200+ soldiers to Georgia on Russia border--and Putin said it's not biggie(he was criticized within Russia by some), and at some point even talked about how one day Russia might be in EU/NATO. \n\nAt the same time one also finds the exact same things Russia is today seeking in ~1996-98, years before Putin gets to power. Strong opposition to NATO, dominance over nearby ex-USSR states(using military means when diplomacy/trade doesn't work), pursuing an alliance with China and India to balance against USA; in short trying to create a multipolar world. Basically of these you'll find as variation in Dugin's infamous book; which a lot of people seem to nowadays straight up dismiss, because the man didn't have very deep links to Kremlin. The thing is that he wasn't the only one to formulate this sort of thing, there were other people who did it 1-2 years before him and who actually worked in the Kremlin.\n\nAs long as their influences remain strong, I don't see Russia changing course. And I think their influences will not wane as long as Russia doesn't have another collapse of economy. \n\nAlso, I find [this address by the Estonian president in Hamburg in 1994 quite interesting](https://vp1992-2001.president.ee/eng/k6ned/K6ne.asp?ID=9401); because many of the things we are facing today are pretty much what he warned about. \n\nSome parts:\n\n>So I am worried that once again irrationalism is getting out of hand in Russian foreign policy and Russian political philosophy. Years ago Solzhenitsyn called on Russians to bid farewell to the empire and instead concentrate on themselves. He used the word \"self-restriction\" and demanded that the Russians should solve their own economic, social, and also intellectual problems. Neglecting this imperative of their great compatriot's, responsible Russian politicians have suddenly, once again, begun to speak openly about the purported \"special role\" of Russia, about a \"peacekeeper\" function that the new Russia has to fulfil throughout the whole territory of the former USSR. Mr Karaganov, one of President Yeltsin's closest advisors, recently expressed this in seemingly unobtrusive form but, in fact quite harshly, when he said that Russia was to play the role of \"primus inter pares\" - the first among equals - in the entire area of the former Soviet empire. \n\n>However, there is also another equally alarming tendency, which out of convenience is passed off as Realpolitik in the democratic West. That is a proclivity for an approach that can be labelled as \"appeasement\". With this approach, one unwittingly becomes an accomplice of imperialist forces in Russia who believe that they can solve their country's immense problems by outward expansion and by threatening their neighbours. \n\n>The social-political or economic processes in Russia, which even today is still more like a supercontinent than a state, cannot be controlled from the outside, as much as one would like to do so. This has been clearly demonstrated by the experience of the recent years: the wide-spread inclination of the free West to regard any leader who happens to be in office in Moscow -be it Khrushchov, Brezhnev, Gorbachov or Yeltsin - as irreplaceable has lead to tremendously bad investments and misjudgements. Whoever really wants to help Russia and the Russian people today must make it emphatically clear to the Russian leadership that another imperialist expansion will not stand a chance. Whoever fails to do so will actually help the enemies of democracy in Russia and other post-communist states.",

And I think their influences will not wane as long as Russia doesn&#39;t have another collapse of economy. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I find <a href=\"https://vp1992-2001.president.ee/eng/k6ned/K6ne.asp?ID=9401\">this address by the Estonian president in Hamburg in 1994 quite interesting</a>; because many of the things we are facing today are pretty much what he warned about. </p>\n\n<p>Some parts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So I am worried that once again irrationalism is getting out of hand in Russian foreign policy and Russian political philosophy. Years ago Solzhenitsyn called on Russians to bid farewell to the empire and instead concentrate on themselves. He used the word &quot;self-restriction&quot; and demanded that the Russians should solve their own economic, social, and also intellectual problems. Neglecting this imperative of their great compatriot&#39;s, responsible Russian politicians have suddenly, once again, begun to speak openly about the purported &quot;special role&quot; of Russia, about a &quot;peacekeeper&quot; function that the new Russia has to fulfil throughout the whole territory of the former USSR. Mr Karaganov, one of President Yeltsin&#39;s closest advisors, recently expressed this in seemingly unobtrusive form but, in fact quite harshly, when he said that Russia was to play the role of &quot;primus inter pares&quot; - the first among equals - in the entire area of the former Soviet empire. </p>\n\n<p>However, there is also another equally alarming tendency, which out of convenience is passed off as Realpolitik in the democratic West. That is a proclivity for an approach that can be labelled as &quot;appeasement&quot;. With this approach, one unwittingly becomes an accomplice of imperialist forces in Russia who believe that they can solve their country&#39;s immense problems by outward expansion and by threatening their neighbours. </p>\n\n<p>The social-political or economic processes in Russia, which even today is still more like a supercontinent than a state, cannot be controlled from the outside, as much as one would like to do so. This has been clearly demonstrated by the experience of the recent years: the wide-spread inclination of the free West to regard any leader who happens to be in office in Moscow -be it Khrushchov, Brezhnev, Gorbachov or Yeltsin - as irreplaceable has lead to tremendously bad investments and misjudgements. Whoever really wants to help Russia and the Russian people today must make it emphatically clear to the Russian leadership that another imperialist expansion will not stand a chance. Whoever fails to do so will actually help the enemies of democracy in Russia and other post-communist states.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The state visits between both countries didn&#39;t start in earnest until well into the Ukrainian conflict, ergo the ongoing consequences of the Ukrainian conflict has deepened their relationship.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>They may have been friends before, but I don&#39;t really care if they were friendly or hostile to each other, all I care about is quantifying if their ties are deepening.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Not really sure what the whole &quot;vat nik&quot; thing is about, if you&#39;re calling me a &quot;vat nik&quot; because I&#39;m pointing out a simple change and obvious deepening of their relationship then I don&#39;t know what to tell you.</p>\n</div>",

I was quantifying the deepening of Russia's relationship with Iran in terms of a major arms purchase, using the transfer of arms that previously were not considered pre-war as a marker for a deepening relationship. Nothing you've said here disproves what I said.\n\nRussia and Iran don't just magically go from enemies to friends, or friends to enemies, there are degree's of friendliness and a quantification of the strength of those ties. The difference between a weak ally and a strong ally etc. This is my entire point. The ongoing war has increased military and governmental cooperation as well as trade and economic ties between the two countries. Just because they were already friends before doesn't mean that this isn't noteworthy or also a **geopolitical consequence.**\n\nI strongly advise you read up on the specific Su-35's that Russia is exporting to Iran, it's highly relevant to the point I'm making. Russia never considered Iran as an export partner for the Su-35, they also never approached them or offered them before the Ukrainian war. The specific airframes that are being exported were originally built for Egypt, who were an original export partner of the Su-35.\n\nIn 2017 the US government (Trump) passed into law a set of sanctions designed to curtail the export of Russian equipment. They used this law to threaten Egypt who then backed out. Those same Su-35's then sat unused in Russia for the better part of half a decade, throughout which Russia looked for a new export partner. DESPITE THIS, Russia did not offer them to Iran.\n\n**It was only after the start of the Ukrainian conflict and after half a year of geopolitical shifting and upheaval that Iran and Russia pursued export of the Su-35.**\n\n**The US has demonstrably failed and made a geopolitical mistake.** If they had played a different card they could have passed the Su-35's over to Egypt and Iran would be twiddling its thumbs with a limited funding domestic program right now whilst the Su-35's sat in a concrete reinforced hangar on the outskirts of Cairo.\n\nInstead they're now heading towards Iranian hands. **This is demonstrably a geopolitical failure that is now tied to this war. The Russians transferring 4th generation fighter jets to Iran is a major step up in military cooperation and a demonstrable example of deepening Russian/Iranian ties as a result of this ongoing conflict.**\n\nThis doesn't mean that we weren't right to sanction Russia, or that the sanctions packages weren't just a cost of doing business in terms of supporting Ukraine or in this case curtailing Russian arms exports, but it's also good to remember that historically speaking these actions will be judged on their merit and their consequences, unintended or otherwise, and deeper Russian and Iranian ties are a consequence of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**It's not only simplistic it's downright untrue**\n\nNothing you've said disproves this. Collecting a list of bad actors in the Middle East and offering it as a smorgasbord does nothing and certainly doesn't make my previous statements untrue. \n\nAlso if we're critiquing based on simplicity now, viewing the Russian/Iranian relationship through a lens of them purely being friends and not quantifying and adjusting the depth of that relationship is an insanely simplistic way to view things.\n\n**My whole point is that their cooperation is increasing, that may be a result of the war, or a result of latent ties being reborn, whatever, regardless it's a geopolitical failure for western nations that have tried over several decades to isolate Iran.**\n\n>I am not calling you anything but simply that that's a very prevalent argument from anti westerners to blame everyone and everything else instead of looking in the mirror at your own shortcomings.\n\nI think you meant to say \"Their own shortcomings\"... *Forgive me if this holds absolutely zero weight with me given there are several implied aspersions in your comments.*\n\nFor what it's worth, **I'm a Westerner**. **I'm Anti-Russian government** and **Pro-Ukraine** in this conflict.

I was hoping it would keep you on topic and get you to argue the points I was making given your previous comment essentially ignored several of my points and went off into the weeds. Good for you I guess, pat yourself on the back. I wish you well on your crusade against formatting tools.\n\nThis is coming across as some frustrated attack against what you presumably consider to be Anti-Western propaganda. If you can't detach discussions and critique of foreign policy from Red/Blue tribal team picking, then this isn't for you. \n\nYou're not arguing in good faith, this will be my last reply because honestly I was hoping we could either clear up some confusion (probably on both sides and certainly a good chance on mine, I'm certainly not infallible) or get into a more granular discussion on Russian/Iranian relations and instead you've completely ignored every single point I've made presumably because you either had no valid argument against it or seemed absolutely determined to argue a new and different point from the start. Your attempts to paint me as some Anti-Westerner are a poor argumentative tool. (I would laugh if this wasn't the one subreddit I come to expecting some level of credible discussion).\n\nYou then got weirdly hurt about my specific grammatical phrasing of the war of all things which was an absolutely insane thing to say because immediately clarifying that Putin invaded Ukraine isn't a requirement considering where we're talking, if anyone here doesn't know that Putin invaded Ukraine at this point then I'm deeply concerned for them and they've possibly been in a coma or living under a rock for nearly two years.  \n\n\n>I don't care what you are and who you are.\n\n  \nIf you didn't care, you wouldn't be trying in this new comment to describe me as an \"Anti-Westerner\" looking to \"throw bombs\" at things? You've clearly made your mind up on what type of person you've chosen to categorize me as and if you didn't care you wouldn't still be going on about it even in this new comment. \n\nThis isn't a good faith argument and it's exhausting to try and discuss specifics and details with someone who seems absolutely dead set on painting someone they disagree with as an \"Anti-Westerner\". Scream somewhere else, this Subreddit is for credible discussion on specifics. I brought specifics to the table, you ignored them, I can't help you beyond this point and it certainly isn't my fault that you're utterly incapable of arguing the point and staying on topic.  \n\n\n>You have no solutions or defendable positions\n\n**Your ignorance of these points or failure to tackle the specifics doesn't discount them. You're losing the argument by virtue of not even engaging in one and yet continue to attempt to engage in a new one each time you're challenged.**\n\nGo back to my original comment, all I'm saying is that this is a shifting point in closer relations between Russia and Iran, a shifting point that western history books might not view kindly in the same way we historically view other conflicts in a retrospective light. That's it. You challenge this, so I then quantify it by showing that the Su-35 export is indicative of a closer shift in relations, given they didn't consider this before the war despite the Su-35's being in storage and available for export even though you asserted that they were already allies at this time. My point is that they are stronger allies now. I disputed your point, you then ignored it entirely and applied a whole new level to this by viewing the entire argument through the toilet roll of branding your opponent as anti-western.  \n\n\n>You keep blaming the west and what we could have done without specifying anything we could have done or offering solutions.\n\n  \nFor a start: I don't need to provide a solution. Recognizing a failing doesn't also require that we constantly point out or even know the solution in the first place. You see a plane in a tree, you know the pilot might have messed up, you don't need to also explain how far back they should have pulled on the yoke to avoid hitting the tree in the first place.\n\nFor what it's worth I don't think the geopolitical relationships can be resolved at this stage and believe we're headed for some relatively long term separation given the severity of Russian actions and now ongoing movements in Iran regarding Uranium enrichment. Things are continuing to move in negative directions for us and at this stage we have very little control or levers to pull globally speaking to avert a closer Russian/Iran relationship which is not in our western interests.\n\nMy point isn't even that there are immediate term solutions, just that history will view this as an inflection point in a net negative shift, that's a geopolitical mistake on our part because arguably we should have tried different methods of dealing with or curtailing Russia's influence or dealt with the Iranian nuclear issue DECADES AGO before the geopolitical tides shifted to bring them both closer together. My point, if you'd read it, was that a small thing we could have done is prevent them from having spare Su-35s to transfer to Iran in the first place, you ignored that though. (You criticized me for offering no solutions or examples of a mistake and if you'd actually taken the time to read you would have seen I provided one). Those attempts may have also ultimately failed, **but it's clear that the path we chose DID fail regardless.**\n\n**The fact it's reached this point is a failure of our strategies to manage the outcome**. We were too late to implement energy reductions and ween ourselves off of Russian energy, letting them reap in huge profits even after the Crimean seizure which went straight into their coffers and allowed a massive (by European standards) modernization of their armed forces which was then directed at Ukraine. We were too late to decouple ourselves from Russian influence and foreign investment are still struggling to deal with this throughout various European states. We also dragged our feet on military procurement which has emboldened Russia and limited our own responses and the depth of our inventories in regards to supporting Ukraine. With the benefit of hindsight it's possible to critique our policies and ensure that we don't provide an opening like this again in the future. Critiquing it doesn't make me an \"Anti-Westerner\", that's honestly an insane position to take.\n\nOn-top of this our haphazard approach to sanctioning Iran or attempting to normalize relations has been a huge mess based largely on shifting political winds in Washington. Rather than fully normalizing or fully sanctioning, we've existed in this weird constantly evolving middle ground that has enabled them to passively continue their domestic nuclear programs, harden and reinforce their initiatives against intervention whilst we flail about worrying what the next incoming American governments take on Iran is going to be.\n\nWe have actively partially contributed to the position of both Iran and Russia in the lead up to this strengthening of their ties. **Our objectives are to reduce cooperation between our enemies, we have failed in that objective and a critical look at the strategies we took and whether they were successful or not is a healthy thing, it doesn't make those being critical \"Anti-Westerners\" or \"throwing bombs\" or whatever other nonsense you're saying there.**\n\nI'll admit I'm critical of my own and other western governments, perhaps more than most, but only because I see room for improvement, particularly in military procurement. Sticking my fingers in my ears, covering my eyes and pretending we played a perfect hand in the lead up to this conflict when the outcome is currently hundreds of thousands of people dying, massive economic upheaval and a complete failure of our soft power to manage or avert the war is painfully na\u00efve and does nothing to avoid us bumbling our way into the exact same scenarios and pitfalls in the future. But by all means, lets throw out all critique as anti westerners throwing bombs and pretend we couldn't have improved our responses, I'm sure that will work next time!",
