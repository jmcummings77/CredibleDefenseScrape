        "body": "It's been a while since I reported on new unit formation or force composition. Many of the facebook pages I survey for info and images have  become reticent (loose lipskis sink shipskis), and I changed the pattern of my charitable giving to emphasize entities rather than units the last few months (Bring Them Home and Doctors without borders are corruption free and nearly overhead free, and UK official efforts regarding plentiful and appropriate drones has undercut the need to answer every solicitation) . Still, stare at enough tea leaves and something will appear.\n\nGeneral procurement of equipment.\n\n  One of the unspoken reasons Orxy is wrapping up the equipment donation pages is that they're becoming unreliable. The network of countries supplying Ukraine has grown markedly, though less and less follow the early war practice of a press conference and a donation: Direct transfers are decidedly more muted because a) the political value of such announcements has declined b) Several countries have had embarrassing back tracks when announced numbers couldn't be met, were junk and c) defense departments would rather not talk as much as state departments about their business. \n\nThough direct donations continue, ring transfers and purchase under contract direct from manufacturers are becoming more  the norm-these transactions are inherently opaque, and supplying regular shipments of small amounts of equipment isn't news worthy.   In the medium and long term, this is a better system: There's often a mis match between what Ukraine needs and what can be donated, America is better at providing useful pots of money that ro-ro ships filled with IFVs, the equipment provided is 'under manufacturer's warranty' and often two generations newer than the donations.  I would expect one further major influx of ex Soviet gear now that Bulgaria has broken its governmental log jam, but then a steady shift to newer gear. Lord alone knows where tanks will come from of course.\n\nThe primary point I'm trying to make (badly) is that sufficient Tanks,Artillery,IFVs,APCs IMVs, and support/supply/ engineering vehicles are continue to accrete over and above battlefield losses and that new units are being created.\n\nRegular Army\n\nThe winter and spring build up of the ground forces has entered its final phase. of the 15 mechanized brigades formed in the new year (not counting 3 formed in November/December, and on the line for months), 2 have been deployed in offensive action and 9 more are combat ready, most quietly deployed to combat sectors if not actively engaged.  The 4 remaining brigades (the 41st,42nd,43rd and 44th OMB) have completed formation and individual/small unit training, moving on to combined unit maneuvers primarily under western instructors.  \n\nOf the odd balls: The 13th Jager has such a competent info black out that I can't even confirm its equipment and force structure, but it is no longer in Sweden and Norway and has returned to UK (I suspect for final integration of Swedish/Finish gear, but what do I know). \nThe 142nd Reserve Rifle Brigade is trained and deployed enough for a few clips to be on twitter. The new unit designation is coming into focus: As you recall, the moniker Reserve Rifle Brigade is new to us. Sifting through the entrails of a goat (it was old, it died of natural causes, I'm not murdering goats), these new brigades appear to be the equivalent of American medium infantry brigades, very similar to the Motorized brigades of 2016, which have since hit the gym and morphed into  'light-heavy' mech brigades. You will notice I used the plural, as not yet official news of the formation of the 141st, 143rd and 144th Reserve Rifle Brigades has filtered out. \nFinally, the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment is approaching it's foretold brigade equivalent status, it's 'reserve' battalion in final training in England.\n\nAn unheralded development has been the proliferation of independent RA battalions. Most appear to be plain vanilla rifle battalions, but some are on an Assault Battalion track that looks more like a Russian BTG, and some appear to be recon battalions. Regardless of their mission, half appear on deployment maps or show up in twitter clips. I can't tell if these smaller units are a purpose unto themselves, or indicators of an accelerated organized brigade formation process, or both. \n\nA similar process is apparent in the territorial defense forces. The 31 TDBs are still in full force, and their use away from home cities on the line is now common practice. At the same time, numerous independent territorial defense battalions have appeared in their home provinces- I can't tell if these are newly formed units or if they are calved off of existing TDBs to make them more uniform (many TDBs were formed with 6,7, even 8 battalions, rather than the authorized 5). Though still officially light infantry, many of the TDBs have 'cyborged', acquiring artillery groups of varying quality, and IFVs/APCs/Franken-vehicles of various kind and number and quality.\n\nOthers\n\nAAB. Much ink has been spilled regarding the 82nd AAB and it is apparently combat ready and in theater, a veritable where's waldo' of assault units.  Little news of the Hertz Regiment since it's designation as the 78th AAB brigade has come to my attention. Although a veteran unit, I suspect it needed some doctrinal training to transition from its SOF history to more of an assault role, and perhaps is training up another battalion/swapping some equipment as well. They'll show up eventually.\n\nMarines. The new formed 37th Marine Brigade has been in the thick of it . I haven't seen any evidence of the 38th in combat as of yet, but will look closer.\n\nThe National Guard.\n\nI'm as confused as ever regarding the inner workings of the NG. The Offensive Guard appears to have been formed and several brigades have been active in Bakmut and further south- It isn't being employed as an independent force.  A number of battalion/regimental/light brigade NG units appear to have escaped the OG integration process, but I need the dust to settle a bit before I can tell what's still independently active. between NG, Foreign Legion, Volunteer Battalions and other miscellany, up to 20 smaller units are active, employed and fighting.\n\nSpecial Ops\nSpecial forces requires its own fully researched entry.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s been a while since I reported on new unit formation or force composition. Many of the facebook pages I survey for info and images have  become reticent (loose lipskis sink shipskis), and I changed the pattern of my charitable giving to emphasize entities rather than units the last few months (Bring Them Home and Doctors without borders are corruption free and nearly overhead free, and UK official efforts regarding plentiful and appropriate drones has undercut the need to answer every solicitation) . Still, stare at enough tea leaves and something will appear.</p>\n\n<p>General procurement of equipment.</p>\n\n<p>One of the unspoken reasons Orxy is wrapping up the equipment donation pages is that they&#39;re becoming unreliable. The network of countries supplying Ukraine has grown markedly, though less and less follow the early war practice of a press conference and a donation: Direct transfers are decidedly more muted because a) the political value of such announcements has declined b) Several countries have had embarrassing back tracks when announced numbers couldn&#39;t be met, were junk and c) defense departments would rather not talk as much as state departments about their business. </p>\n\n<p>Though direct donations continue, ring transfers and purchase under contract direct from manufacturers are becoming more  the norm-these transactions are inherently opaque, and supplying regular shipments of small amounts of equipment isn&#39;t news worthy.   In the medium and long term, this is a better system: There&#39;s often a mis match between what Ukraine needs and what can be donated, America is better at providing useful pots of money that ro-ro ships filled with IFVs, the equipment provided is &#39;under manufacturer&#39;s warranty&#39; and often two generations newer than the donations.  I would expect one further major influx of ex Soviet gear now that Bulgaria has broken its governmental log jam, but then a steady shift to newer gear. Lord alone knows where tanks will come from of course.</p>\n\n<p>The primary point I&#39;m trying to make (badly) is that sufficient Tanks,Artillery,IFVs,APCs IMVs, and support/supply/ engineering vehicles are continue to accrete over and above battlefield losses and that new units are being created.</p>\n\n<p>Regular Army</p>\n\n<p>The winter and spring build up of the ground forces has entered its final phase. of the 15 mechanized brigades formed in the new year (not counting 3 formed in November/December, and on the line for months), 2 have been deployed in offensive action and 9 more are combat ready, most quietly deployed to combat sectors if not actively engaged.  The 4 remaining brigades (the 41st,42nd,43rd and 44th OMB) have completed formation and individual/small unit training, moving on to combined unit maneuvers primarily under western instructors.  </p>\n\n<p>Of the odd balls: The 13th Jager has such a competent info black out that I can&#39;t even confirm its equipment and force structure, but it is no longer in Sweden and Norway and has returned to UK (I suspect for final integration of Swedish/Finish gear, but what do I know). \nThe 142nd Reserve Rifle Brigade is trained and deployed enough for a few clips to be on twitter. The new unit designation is coming into focus: As you recall, the moniker Reserve Rifle Brigade is new to us. Sifting through the entrails of a goat (it was old, it died of natural causes, I&#39;m not murdering goats), these new brigades appear to be the equivalent of American medium infantry brigades, very similar to the Motorized brigades of 2016, which have since hit the gym and morphed into  &#39;light-heavy&#39; mech brigades. You will notice I used the plural, as not yet official news of the formation of the 141st, 143rd and 144th Reserve Rifle Brigades has filtered out. \nFinally, the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment is approaching it&#39;s foretold brigade equivalent status, it&#39;s &#39;reserve&#39; battalion in final training in England.</p>\n\n<p>An unheralded development has been the proliferation of independent RA battalions. Most appear to be plain vanilla rifle battalions, but some are on an Assault Battalion track that looks more like a Russian BTG, and some appear to be recon battalions. Regardless of their mission, half appear on deployment maps or show up in twitter clips. I can&#39;t tell if these smaller units are a purpose unto themselves, or indicators of an accelerated organized brigade formation process, or both. </p>\n\n<p>A similar process is apparent in the territorial defense forces. The 31 TDBs are still in full force, and their use away from home cities on the line is now common practice. At the same time, numerous independent territorial defense battalions have appeared in their home provinces- I can&#39;t tell if these are newly formed units or if they are calved off of existing TDBs to make them more uniform (many TDBs were formed with 6,7, even 8 battalions, rather than the authorized 5). Though still officially light infantry, many of the TDBs have &#39;cyborged&#39;, acquiring artillery groups of varying quality, and IFVs/APCs/Franken-vehicles of various kind and number and quality.</p>\n\n<p>Others</p>\n\n<p>AAB. Much ink has been spilled regarding the 82nd AAB and it is apparently combat ready and in theater, a veritable where&#39;s waldo&#39; of assault units.  Little news of the Hertz Regiment since it&#39;s designation as the 78th AAB brigade has come to my attention. Although a veteran unit, I suspect it needed some doctrinal training to transition from its SOF history to more of an assault role, and perhaps is training up another battalion/swapping some equipment as well. They&#39;ll show up eventually.</p>\n\n<p>Marines. The new formed 37th Marine Brigade has been in the thick of it . I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of the 38th in combat as of yet, but will look closer.</p>\n\n<p>The National Guard.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m as confused as ever regarding the inner workings of the NG. The Offensive Guard appears to have been formed and several brigades have been active in Bakmut and further south- It isn&#39;t being employed as an independent force.  A number of battalion/regimental/light brigade NG units appear to have escaped the OG integration process, but I need the dust to settle a bit before I can tell what&#39;s still independently active. between NG, Foreign Legion, Volunteer Battalions and other miscellany, up to 20 smaller units are active, employed and fighting.</p>\n\n<p>Special Ops\nSpecial forces requires its own fully researched entry. But between the official RA Special Operations Forces, The Marine commando forces, units under the loose guidance of the Intelligence Directorate, the Interior Ministry and of course Kraken, there must be 4-6 battalions worth of elite light infantry sculking around corners and liquidating WarGonzo.</p>\n\n<p>Other</p>\n\n<p>Other than the announcement of its formation, I&#39;ve yet to see any evidence of an Air Force Infantry Brigade.  </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all I have for now. If anyone can fill in some blanks, feel free to comment.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Any testing and evaluation process worth its salt will investigate whether models can match partially obscured, damaged, reconfigured, or repainted targets. That's basically the whole point of using something as complex as ML: it can handle weird edge cases, sometimes even better than humans. So I am absolutely certain someone would have thought to ask, \"What if they paint the ships?\" Or, \"What if the stern is so damaged it can't be recognized? Or the bow? Or both?\" Otherwise how would multiple drones be able to attack without the first-to-strike disrupting the targeting of the subsequent drones, preventing the drones from hitting a target more than a single time?\n\nBesides, the problem can be solved with classical object detection methods. If an algorithm can only recognize a ship in one exact configuration, that's no different than using such an algorithm to extract and transform the ship's shape to a standard perspective, and then matching that extracted ship shape against a database of known enemy vessels. Even a system as straightforward as that would be able to handle partial matches, just with much lower confidence than a properly designed ML algorithm would.\n\nAlso remember that the Russians almost certainly do not have access to the underlying model in order to conduct adversarial testing to validate the effectiveness of this camouflage. So even if that is their intent, they would be doing no more than taking a completely wild guess about what might in theory disrupt the machine learning algorithm, with no more ability to predict the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure than you or I would have. Maybe painting the bow and the stern will reduce a recognition algorithm's effectiveness (which I seriously doubt), but it's way more likely that a technique to fool an ML solution would be something truly bizarre like painting a QR code on the hull that encodes the precise dimensions of a civilian fishing ship or painting a smaller ship on the side of the ship. \n\nAlso I doubt the Ukrainians (or anyone else, for that matter) have sufficient sample videos of Russian naval vessels viewed from roughly Seadoo level with the Seadoo and the target moving at varying speeds and angles to each other in various weather conditions as defensive weaponry sometimes rains down in the water around the drone. Which you would need in order to train or test any non-trivial machine learning algorithm to handle terminal guidance against a target. \n\nI'm guessing the boring explanation here is the truth. That is, the camo is intended to make it harder for the human drone operators to eyeball the ship's bearing from the drone's low perspective just above the waterline as they are closing to attack, giving the Russian crew a bit more time to intercept or evade. So exactly like WW1 dazzle patterns, except to mess with drone operators instead of u-boat captains. The drone cameras and WW1 periscopes are at roughly the same height above the water, actually, so it makes some sense from that perspective.\n\nThe drones are almost certainly being manually guided at all times during their operations, even if they have limited autonomy capabilities when they lose connection with the operator. We know that they have had live connections up until the very moment of their destruction because the Ukrainians have released footage in each case documenting those last moments. If the drone has a strong enough connection to stream video back to the operator, it has a strong enough connection to receive remote guidance from them too. No reason to let some algorithm handle such a critical and unpredictable phase of the operation in that case. And there would also be no reason to risk leaving the operation or targeting to an algorithm because the vehicles are slow moving and stable (unlike, say, missiles which require many extremely fast control and guidance decisions because of their great speed and instability) and thus far have proven capable of maintaining a command link during the critical terminal guidance phase.\n\nI'm guessing the weight of the explosives they load onto the things is about the same as the expected passenger weight for a Seadoo, giving it similar performance characteristics in general. I would thus estimate the max speed and range by looking at comparable jet skis. Seadoos can cruise at around 80kph with bursts up to 100kph or so for newer models. They can only go about 100-200km on a tank of fuel, which amounts to maybe two hours of operating time. All of which is depending on sea conditions. I suspect you will see more attacks in bad weather that restricts visibility and adds visual clutter to the sea with waves and foam, making it harder for Russian spotters to see the drones on approach. The most favorable sea conditions for an attack are thus likely to push that range down quite a bit. Meaning they almost certainly don't have these things out and about for round the clock patrols, and it isn't unreasonable to have an operator paying close attention to the craft for the entire two-hour mission, ready to react to any unexpected events quickly.\n\nAll of which suggests it's way cheaper and simpler to just have someone drive the thing remotely the entire time it is operating than it would be to develop a robust autonomy solution. Especially on the fly during a war. Sevastopol is 300km away from Ukrainian-held territory and the other attack on the intel ship happened more like 500km away. So the Ukrainians probably port the drones out to sea on manned patrol boats to a location within 50-200kms away from where they expect the BSF to be operating, depending on how weather conditions are impacting the drones' expected range and how much they want to risk the patrol boat being attacked itself. Then after receiving confirmation that targets are in range from other assets like Bayraktars or whatever, the sailors let the drones loose, which then drive straight toward their targets as fast as possible, to minimize the opportunity for Russian air or naval assets to detect them and organize a defense. \n\nAll of which is to say: the level of autonomy required for the conops is pretty low to begin with, the data infrastructure and resources required to support any ML enhancement for the system are unlikely to exist, and to the extent that targeting enhancement in terminal guidance would be helpful for overcoming any EW countermeasures that disrupt the command link during that critical phase, classical objection recognition techniques would be more than sufficient. Probably even better than any fancy optical guidance algorithms would be adding a radar, infrared, or whatever other kind of seeker head to the drone. It's not much different than a shallow-running torpedo targeting a surface ship, for example. Comparable seeker heads on missiles can be pretty small and light, e.g. MANPADs or ATGMs, so adding one wouldn't detract much from the max warhead load.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Any testing and evaluation process worth its salt will investigate whether models can match partially obscured, damaged, reconfigured, or repainted targets. That&#39;s basically the whole point of using something as complex as ML: it can handle weird edge cases, sometimes even better than humans. So I am absolutely certain someone would have thought to ask, &quot;What if they paint the ships?&quot; Or, &quot;What if the stern is so damaged it can&#39;t be recognized? Or the bow? Or both?&quot; Otherwise how would multiple drones be able to attack without the first-to-strike disrupting the targeting of the subsequent drones, preventing the drones from hitting a target more than a single time?</p>\n\n<p>Besides, the problem can be solved with classical object detection methods. If an algorithm can only recognize a ship in one exact configuration, that&#39;s no different than using such an algorithm to extract and transform the ship&#39;s shape to a standard perspective, and then matching that extracted ship shape against a database of known enemy vessels. Even a system as straightforward as that would be able to handle partial matches, just with much lower confidence than a properly designed ML algorithm would.</p>\n\n<p>Also remember that the Russians almost certainly do not have access to the underlying model in order to conduct adversarial testing to validate the effectiveness of this camouflage. So even if that is their intent, they would be doing no more than taking a completely wild guess about what might in theory disrupt the machine learning algorithm, with no more ability to predict the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure than you or I would have. Maybe painting the bow and the stern will reduce a recognition algorithm&#39;s effectiveness (which I seriously doubt), but it&#39;s way more likely that a technique to fool an ML solution would be something truly bizarre like painting a QR code on the hull that encodes the precise dimensions of a civilian fishing ship or painting a smaller ship on the side of the ship. </p>\n\n<p>Also I doubt the Ukrainians (or anyone else, for that matter) have sufficient sample videos of Russian naval vessels viewed from roughly Seadoo level with the Seadoo and the target moving at varying speeds and angles to each other in various weather conditions as defensive weaponry sometimes rains down in the water around the drone. Which you would need in order to train or test any non-trivial machine learning algorithm to handle terminal guidance against a target. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m guessing the boring explanation here is the truth. That is, the camo is intended to make it harder for the human drone operators to eyeball the ship&#39;s bearing from the drone&#39;s low perspective just above the waterline as they are closing to attack, giving the Russian crew a bit more time to intercept or evade. So exactly like WW1 dazzle patterns, except to mess with drone operators instead of u-boat captains. The drone cameras and WW1 periscopes are at roughly the same height above the water, actually, so it makes some sense from that perspective.</p>\n\n<p>The drones are almost certainly being manually guided at all times during their operations, even if they have limited autonomy capabilities when they lose connection with the operator. We know that they have had live connections up until the very moment of their destruction because the Ukrainians have released footage in each case documenting those last moments. If the drone has a strong enough connection to stream video back to the operator, it has a strong enough connection to receive remote guidance from them too. No reason to let some algorithm handle such a critical and unpredictable phase of the operation in that case. And there would also be no reason to risk leaving the operation or targeting to an algorithm because the vehicles are slow moving and stable (unlike, say, missiles which require many extremely fast control and guidance decisions because of their great speed and instability) and thus far have proven capable of maintaining a command link during the critical terminal guidance phase.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m guessing the weight of the explosives they load onto the things is about the same as the expected passenger weight for a Seadoo, giving it similar performance characteristics in general.

IIRC the drones are around 4m long. You could stash at least a couple of those below decks on basically any pleasure yacht over 10m in length, sail or motor. But if they are in patrol boats, that's part of the reason they likely prefer to operate in choppy weather. The patrol boats I've seen donated are small enough to hide a bit in waves, unlike say, a US fleet carrier, or even smaller surface combatants like destroyers, which are enormous relative to the average wave height in the Black Sea. Whereas patrol boats can be at least roughly the same size as the waves on especially rough days that are still within safe operational parameters. The patrol boats can't quite hide as well as the drones, which are even lower profile and thus can approach much more closely without being detected, but it is very likely the boats are small enough to hide in surface noise at 50-100km+ range. Especially if they are located somewhere the Russians aren't expecting them to be. Russian radar is likely far better tuned for detecting large surface combatants and aerial threats than it is for small craft, and that weakness only grows with range.",

DPICM submunitions aren't buried and aren't triggered by stepping on them, they can injure legs if someone goes around kicking them, but the DPICM aren't blast weapons they work by tandem frag and small HEAT charge. \n\nEach munition has between 60 to hundreds of those submunitions, supposedly about 3% don't detonate when used so they litter the impact area in large numbers because nobody just fires one DPICM round or rocket, tactics call to saturate an area with them. \n\nThe bigger problem for cleanup aren't civilians its military forces who often have to immediately move through those impact areas filled with what are essentially live fragmentation hand grenades all over the ground that may go off at any moment from any pressure, etc. The most common means of EOD disposal is to just plow the area with an armored bulldozer. \n\nDOD doesn't like them because it drank the PGM Koolaid hard and also hate the UXO risk associated especially to our own troops, as there were numerous incidents in 1991 and then during the GWOT where we suffered casualties after the fact, typically at air fields in Iraq when we used DPICM by way of MLRS or ATACMS or cluster bombs during the invasion and later took over the bases where US troops accidentally triggered some because nobody told them the location had been previously hit, and to be on the lookout. Or a cleanup had been done and they missed some. That makes for bad press, commanders get in trouble for it (\"Why did your unit take casualties? Why were you so irresponsible to not perform a proper cleanup?\"), so for them its better to not use them if they think they can get even better effects with PGMs, which up until this war they didn't think could be jammed. \n\nAlso, standard international protocol when using landmines is to plot their locations that gets sent up the chain of command and stored so EVERYONE knows where they are (which makes recovering them that much easier). But there is no stipulation with DPICM, as they are just considered another type of artillery ammo or bombload. And lots of time the word doesn't passed so troops on the ground moving through impact areas don't know. Fact is that civilians no better, because typically they do know the area is littered with them, but the unfortunate problem is kids are often too dumb to follow warnings (I'm a father of young children, and my kids will pick up anything shiny, that's what kids do because they don't know any better). \n\nUsed correctly and in large numbers they are incredibly effective, especially against large massed armored or infantry formations, as well as for counterbattery. They're best used defensively. \n\nHowever, in a situation like Ukraine now, if the UAF used them offensively to, say, suppress a Russian defensive position before assaulting it, and the users forgot to tell the assault force or the assault force didn't prep for dealing with UXOs, that can be a problem.",

Fact is that civilians no better, because typically they do know the area is littered with them, but the unfortunate problem is kids are often too dumb to follow warnings (I&#39;m a father of young children, and my kids will pick up anything shiny, that&#39;s what kids do because they don&#39;t know any better). </p>\n\n<p>Used correctly and in large numbers they are incredibly effective, especially against large massed armored or infantry formations, as well as for counterbattery. They&#39;re best used defensively. </p>\n\n<p>However, in a situation like Ukraine now, if the UAF used them offensively to, say, suppress a Russian defensive position before assaulting it, and the users forgot to tell the assault force or the assault force didn&#39;t prep for dealing with UXOs, that can be a problem.</p>\n</div>",

It had basically been built with the sole purpose of tackling the Soviet Union, that had defined entire careers and agencies for decades, and without the old enemy they all really lacked a raison d'\u00eatre. One of the initial pivot points was to handling exactly this sort of thing. In fact, I'd argue that corporate espionage, specifically Chinese corporate espionage, was probably the main focus of US intelligence in the post-Cold War moment... for about two years or so, when terrorism started to take the spotlight. It's not that the US was unaware or not acting on these cases, but they were not considered as much of a priority.\n\nFrankly I think it's a failing of US intelligence in the 90s to now. These cases becoming more prominent shows how much of a target rich environment the US business world is and in the wake of the War on Terror it feels as though the feds have essentially tried to offload most of the economic intelligence policing onto corporations themselves. Now that the US intelligence community is shifting its focus back to great power competition (again), I think that trend may change. China and Russia are obviously going to be the major focus for intelligence going forward and China clearly makes corporate espionage a priority in its intelligence craft. That in turn means that the US will have to take the whole field more seriously than it has in the past. It's always interesting to get glimpses of changing intelligence priorities and how agencies will adapt.",

In fact, I&#39;d argue that corporate espionage, specifically Chinese corporate espionage, was probably the main focus of US intelligence in the post-Cold War moment... for about two years or so, when terrorism started to take the spotlight. It&#39;s not that the US was unaware or not acting on these cases, but they were not considered as much of a priority.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly I think it&#39;s a failing of US intelligence in the 90s to now. These cases becoming more prominent shows how much of a target rich environment the US business world is and in the wake of the War on Terror it feels as though the feds have essentially tried to offload most of the economic intelligence policing onto corporations themselves. Now that the US intelligence community is shifting its focus back to great power competition (again), I think that trend may change. China and Russia are obviously going to be the major focus for intelligence going forward and China clearly makes corporate espionage a priority in its intelligence craft. That in turn means that the US will have to take the whole field more seriously than it has in the past. It&#39;s always interesting to get glimpses of changing intelligence priorities and how agencies will adapt.</p>\n</div>",

Finland joined in April but Turkey blocked Sweden\u2019s accession, accusing it of offering refuge to political activists wanted on terrorism charges. \n\n>Sweden lifted a ban on arms sales to Turkey and amended its anti-terrorism laws as part of a deal clinched last year to break the impasse. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signaled last week, however, that those steps may not be enough to win Turkish support for the bid at the next NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\n>Turkey wants Sweden to begin extraditing or expelling suspects to prove it is serious about implementing the new rules, said the people, speaking on condition of anonymity to share sensitive information. Turkey has demanded the extradition of more than 130 people, most of them Kurdish separatists.\n\n>They include alleged supporters of Kurdish militant group the PKK, which is labeled a terrorist organization by the US and the European Union, as well as of affiliated Kurdish YPG forces in Syria and followers of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Erdogan alleges Gulen plotted a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey.\n\n>Turkey\u2019s government didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Swedish foreign minister\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\n>Extradition requests to Sweden are handled by the country\u2019s judiciary. The government can\u2019t overrule decisions by its Supreme Court, which has rejected appeals from Turkey on various grounds, including risk of persecution.\n\n>NATO allies have repeatedly urged Turkey to approve Sweden\u2019s bid in time for the summit, saying the country meets all qualifications. The latest call came from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday.\n\n>\u201cI firmly believe that Sweden should join Finland at the summit table as a new ally,\u201d Scholz told the parliament in Berlin. \u201cAnd I appeal to Turkey\u2019s re-elected President Erdogan to now clear the way for this - as we all decided together in Madrid last year.\u201d\n\n>Sweden\u2019s accession would clinch NATO\u2019s control of the Baltic Sea and give the alliance the upper hand in the Arctic region \u2014 both strategic gateways for Russia \u2014 even as Moscow is bogged down in its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n>Finland completed the process to join the alliance in April, leaving Sweden in limbo over its prospects, with both Turkey and Hungary\u2019s ratifications outstanding.",

            "body": "Keep in mind inflation is a slow burning problem. It usually takes time for hyperinflation to set in. Take this example of the German mark.\n\n1 dollar = \n\n1914: 4.2 marks\n\n1918: 7.9 marks\n\n1919: 48 marks\n\n1921: 90 marks\n\n1922: 330 marks\n\n1923: 685 marks\n\nAs you can see, there was very large inflation during WW1 for Germany as they resorted to money printing. Goods would have risen in cost dramatically for germans, but likely wartime rationing papered over some of the effects, as did tight authoritarian control of the economy. The end of the war and the end of that tight control revealed in 1919 significant inflation. The imposition of reparations and unrestrained money printing in 1921 is when hyperinflation set in.\n\nLet's look at another example of hyperinflation, this time a peacetime economy. We'll compare the dollar to the turkish lira, another economy similarly run by an authoritarian government engaged in unrestrained money printing.\n\n1 dollar = \n\n2012: 1.8 Lira\n\n2018: 3.75 Lira\n\n2019: 5.9 Lira\n\n2020: 7.8 Lira\n\n2021: 13.9 Lira\n\n2022: 18.6 Lira\n\n2023: 24.85 (as of today)\n\nAs we can see, this level of inflation while hyperbolic is nowhere close to as bad as in the Weimar republic (likely due to the fact of not being a post-war time economy in transition nor paying reparations). But inflation is still a massive problem in in Turkyie. We can see though that it only really became a huge problem starting around 2021. Economic problems like inflation usually start small and escalate.\n\nRussia is unlikely to have reparations imposed, so runaway hyperinflation is somewhat unlikely. But large scale inflation is certain. We will not know the extent due to government manipulation of numbers. Even then, we can expect that it will take **years** for Russia's economy to experience even modest inflation, and it will only be really post-war that the true extent of inflation will start becoming apparent.",

They could rain down GMLRS and JDAMS in a tactical fashion on trenches and fortifications.

Walking with the aid of a cane and carrying a pistol, he personally made a reconnaissance of the area immediately to the rear of the beach to locate the causeways that were to be used for the advance inland.

That'll allow Western air to penetrate Russian airspace regularly but also cause high attrition from ADA ambushes.\n\nThis part is quite interesting to think about. \n\nIn the campaign during Vietnam, the USA struggled against popup ambush techniques and the USA lost aircraft throughout the war to SAMs. I think in the 50 years since that conflict, the USA has vastly vastly improved their SEAD capability. The areas I see are the following: behind enemy line battlefield intelligence (drone, human, and satellite), drone warfare, better experience, and higher quality weapons. \n\nHere is the way I'd set it up. I'd have 3-4 aircraft with EW/HARM-88 in the theater during air operations. Along with 3-4 aircraft providing CAP with 6 AIM-120Ds each. Around 100-200 miles of line. That would likely be F35s and/or F22s along with some F15s or A10s ready to pop in if anybody \"tries to ambush\" to drop some 1000-2000lb bombs on any discovered anti-air assets - moving in at low altitude. The goal would be to keep enemy SAMs 50-100 miles away from the front. \n\nThe above would give you the capability to drop JDAMs safely from 30-40 miles behind enemy lines in either a \"pop up\" or high altitude coverage for non-stealthy aircraft. That gives CAS capability to ~15 minutes for static targets. It would also give the capability for F35s to provide high-altitude CAS missions AT THE FRONT. That means they can drop laser guided bombs on moving targets. These F35s would be able to fight with pretty much impunity aside from the occasional S400 shooting a missile from 100 miles away blindly. \n\nThis also gives is the capability for low-altitude CAS. We're talking Apache gunships (from a long range using pop-up tactics), A-10 warhogs, and C-130s gunships below about 1000'. That would put those aircraft in danger of being hit by manpads, but if you have multiple assets in the area (F35s high up), you can move on any manpads and make it very difficult to deploy any manpads. There will be losses. Those losses could be acceptable to create a breakout in a small area of operation. I would not want to be on the Manpad team shooting missiles at a C130 gunship with F35 coverage at 35k feet in the area. \n\nEssentially what you'd do is pick an area for a breakout. Probably a 100 mile line. Put in a few hundred MBTs and probably 500 IFV/APCs in that area. Pound the shit out of that line with 300-400 air assets along with SEAD for roughly 24 hours. Then move in with the ground assets. Keep that pressure up for 2-3 days (rotating in the 300-400 air assets with probably 50 on station continuously), hitting anything that moves. Including SEADs. The goal of this would be to create chaos on the enemy and then seize the initiative to do a thunder run to cut off, encircle, and then force a surrender. \n\nWith the above battlefield, I wouldn't be surprised with a 10-50/1 KD ratio favoring NATO/USA. \n\nIf you were working a S400 system 100 miles behind the front, and you heard that tanks just broke out and are headed your way at 30-40 mph, you'd be packing up immediately to GTFO. \n\nThere is very little doubt in my mind that if the USA entered the war, Russia would be headed back to Moscow to lick their wounds... and probably thinking about other options *cough cough* nukes *cough cough*.",

They're oversold by some shadier parts of the security industry for reasons that don't stand to engineering scrutiny and, in this particular case, wouldn't stand to strategic scrutiny, either.\n\n1. Supply chain tracking for physical items is very difficult, especially when it comes to supplying physical items via tortuous items. If you backdoor your chips, Baikal Electronics can trivially pull a reverse backdoor stunt, where they place an order for 10,000 backdoored chips, then send 5,000 of them to China, where they are installed in equipment sold on the Western market. Controlling backdoored devices is difficult but doable to some degree. Controlling backdoored *components*, on the other hand, is completely unfeasible.\n2. There is enormous business risk to any company selling backdoored components. It will inevitably raise the question of whether Russia is the only place where backdoored components end up, and if Ukraine is the only place where the keys end up. The general public is less sensitive to these things, but we're talking about components for specialised applications -- the general public is not the audience here. Not only is this risk extremely difficult to mitigate, it's also extremely difficult for end users and integrators to evaluate. What do I do if I find I have a server with a component that's also sold in the backdoored version on the motherboard? Do I contact the manufacturer and say hey, guys, can you tell me if I got the version with a backdoor?\n3. Last, but not least, \"the US\" isn't really giving them chips, US *companies* are, often through third-party suppliers. It's a stunt that's extremely difficult to pull off. Chips are often shipped from stock, so even if you start manufacfturing the backdoored versions now, it'll take a while before they hit the suppliers' stocks. Then you've got to make sure the suppliers fulfill orders from Russia from the backdoored stock, which needs tight controls on the supplier's side, otherwise you end up with backdoored chips all over the world. However, it's very hard to keep a lid on the fact that some stock batches are for the Russian market and others are for the non-Russian market, and integrator-supplier business partnerships are pretty tight (also pretty personal; I still meet for lunch with folks who used to work for a big supplier a long time ago; they haven't worked there forever, I haven't done any PCB design in forever, but we still keep in touch because realistically I've spent more time talking to them on the phone than with my girlfriend back in high school).

The general public is less sensitive to these things, but we&#39;re talking about components for specialised applications -- the general public is not the audience here. Not only is this risk extremely difficult to mitigate, it&#39;s also extremely difficult for end users and integrators to evaluate. What do I do if I find I have a server with a component that&#39;s also sold in the backdoored version on the motherboard? Do I contact the manufacturer and say hey, guys, can you tell me if I got the version with a backdoor?</li>\n<li>Last, but not least, &quot;the US&quot; isn&#39;t really giving them chips, US <em>companies</em> are, often through third-party suppliers. It&#39;s a stunt that&#39;s extremely difficult to pull off. Chips are often shipped from stock, so even if you start manufacfturing the backdoored versions now, it&#39;ll take a while before they hit the suppliers&#39; stocks. Then you&#39;ve got to make sure the suppliers fulfill orders from Russia from the backdoored stock, which needs tight controls on the supplier&#39;s side, otherwise you end up with backdoored chips all over the world. However, it&#39;s very hard to keep a lid on the fact that some stock batches are for the Russian market and others are for the non-Russian market, and integrator-supplier business partnerships are pretty tight (also pretty personal; I still meet for lunch with folks who used to work for a big supplier a long time ago; they haven&#39;t worked there forever, I haven&#39;t done any PCB design in forever, but we still keep in touch because realistically I&#39;ve spent more time talking to them on the phone than with my girlfriend back in high school). The chances of this remaining covert are practically zero.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

However, Russia took a significant portion of their T-80 fleet out of active service during the 2000's and 2010's.  It is estimated in the late 1990's roughly 60% of Russia's tank forces were composed of T-80 models.  By early 2022 it had dropped to an estimated 17%. The T-72 had become the backbone of Russia's tank fleet prior to the invasion of Ukraine.  The artic units retained the T-80 due to the superior extreme cold weather performance of the gas turbine engine.  The 4th Guards Tank Division retained the T-80 and were the sole operator of the T-80U.

With the T-80BVM upgrade program being in full swing prior to the invasion, their industry was geared up to work with T-80 tank coming out of storage.  However, sanctions have definitely stifled this to some extent.\n\nRussian industry seems to have been primarily focused on backfilling losses with T-72 tanks for most of the war so far.  This makes sense due to a large part of their industry being focused on T-72 upgrades in recent years.  I've seen some evidence that they have been running low on T-72 tanks that are in good enough condition to bother reactivating.

So you are really going to have to use a lot to have an impact, you will also face the fact that most of the more modern equipment is NCB capable so all the western tanks, APCs, IFVs and even things like MRAPS are NCB capable. </p>\n\n<p>Then there is intelligence, the US seems to have Russia heavily penetrated so they cant really do this in a sneak way. Likely the west would be able to get large amounts of NCB suits to Ukraine in time. </p>\n\n<p>The consequence&#39;s for Russia would be politically disastrous among the broadly non aligned world. The cost benefit ratio and even if they would be useful is pretty questionable. </p>\n\n<p>At least with tactical nuclear weapons hitting command and control as well as logistics hubs would have a major impact on Ukraines capacity to fight. Rather than just forcing them to decontaminate the site and kit before continuing.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Any obstacle, minefields included, are of extremely limited effect if not covered by fires.  Thus, the assaulting force must suppress or obscure the enemy's ability to return fire and observe the breach site.  Ammunition corresponds to time.  The longer it takes to get the assaulting force form one side of the obstacle to the other, the more ammunition is expended, thus less is available to continue the assault on the far side of the obstacle.  Whenever I was planning a breach I always worked closely with whatever supporting fire elements we had so I knew that they could provide us enough time on target to breach the obstacle then get the assaulting element to the far side.  At that point a battlefield handoff could occur where the assaulting element could takeover fires.\n\nIt is also of extreme importance that the flow of the assaulting element through a breach is well coordinated and controlled.  Otherwise, you'll have what happened to the Ukrainians in that one video.  A quagmire of vehicles bunched up, driving out of the cleared lane hitting mine, and sitting in the middle of an open field where the Russian's can see and engage them.\n\nThere appear to be some short comings on how they are conducting their breaching operations.  This is not surprising to me at all.  Breaching operations are some of the most complicated and dangerous aspects of assaulting a prepared defense position.  The equipment Ukraine has is perfectly effective at proofing a lane through a mine field.  The issues are on the tactical side of how they approach an attack that will involve breaching a minefield.  Throwing bodies at a mine field with not help to resolve these problems.  It will only result in more casualties and a higher likelihood of breakdown in cohesion.  Additionally, Ukraine seems to be having success in some areas at getting past Russian defenses.\n\nHowever, manual proofing and clearing a lane through an obstacle is still an integral part of breaching doctrine.  Visually and with metal detectors/GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar).  When available it is always preferable to use systems such as Bangalore Torpedoes, APOBS, MICLIC, and mine plows.  They are faster and more effective.\n\nMy experience is as a combat engineer in the Marine Corps.  Since the Marine Corps is a light infantry organization, I'm most familiar with breaching for platoon and company sized infantry elements.  I have less experience with breaching for larger or armored assaults.  The Army trains to handle those types of operations much more.  Additionally, this is a very broad question with a lot of breaching doctrine behind it, so if you have any further questions feel free to ask.  I hope this kinda helped to answer your question.",

At that point a battlefield handoff could occur where the assaulting element could takeover fires.</p>\n\n<p>It is also of extreme importance that the flow of the assaulting element through a breach is well coordinated and controlled.  Otherwise, you&#39;ll have what happened to the Ukrainians in that one video.  A quagmire of vehicles bunched up, driving out of the cleared lane hitting mine, and sitting in the middle of an open field where the Russian&#39;s can see and engage them.</p>\n\n<p>There appear to be some short comings on how they are conducting their breaching operations.  This is not surprising to me at all.  Breaching operations are some of the most complicated and dangerous aspects of assaulting a prepared defense position.  The equipment Ukraine has is perfectly effective at proofing a lane through a mine field.  The issues are on the tactical side of how they approach an attack that will involve breaching a minefield.  Throwing bodies at a mine field with not help to resolve these problems.  It will only result in more casualties and a higher likelihood of breakdown in cohesion.  Additionally, Ukraine seems to be having success in some areas at getting past Russian defenses.</p>\n\n<p>However, manual proofing and clearing a lane through an obstacle is still an integral part of breaching doctrine.  Visually and with metal detectors/GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar).  When available it is always preferable to use systems such as Bangalore Torpedoes, APOBS, MICLIC, and mine plows.  They are faster and more effective.</p>\n\n<p>My experience is as a combat engineer in the Marine Corps.  Since the Marine Corps is a light infantry organization, I&#39;m most familiar with breaching for platoon and company sized infantry elements.  I have less experience with breaching for larger or armored assaults.  The Army trains to handle those types of operations much more.  Additionally, this is a very broad question with a lot of breaching doctrine behind it, so if you have any further questions feel free to ask.  I hope this kinda helped to answer your question.</p>\n</div>",

It's been known for guys to not probably check the overhead clearance prior to setting one off.  Thus, they'd shoot the rocket into a tree.
