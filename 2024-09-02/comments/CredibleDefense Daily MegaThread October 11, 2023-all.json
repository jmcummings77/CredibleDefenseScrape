      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Although support for Ukraine maintains bipartisan majority backing, the Republican party, holding a majority, can impede aid packages (essentially, a minority of Republicans prevails over the majority of the House). This does not bode well for the country ([see my Aug 11 comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15naiwc/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_10_2023/jvoj0qr/)):\n\n> What I think this means: Biden **can't secure more PDA** funds through the **current House**. He will likely **stretch out the remaining $6 billion** for the foreseeable future, which probably means approximately $500 million in PDA per month. The next PDA announced is slated to be only $200 million; this is likely a harbinger of future PDAs. Oh well.\n\nAlthough this might not have been obvious to us here on CD, the Biden administration seems to have been fully aware of this (they're politicians after all, they deal with the House on the daily basis). Consequently, since the middle of the summer they're trickling the last bits of PDA funds to ensure a reduced, yet steady stream of aid.\n\nPrevious discussions: [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/16oe0xb/credibledefense_daily_megathread_september_21_2023/k1lb4u0/), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15naiwc/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_10_2023/jvoj0qr/).",

        "body": "The Association for the US Army (AUSA) is holding their annual meeting and showcase. There have been a lot of interesting concept vehicles presented. \n\nGDLS showed off their [Tracked Robot 10-ton (TRX)](https://www.gdls.com/trx/) configured for SHORAD; particularly C-UAS [(image)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8B2bb-WgAE10rK?format=jpg&name=large) [(video)](https://twitter.com/ronkainen7k15/status/1709913932981494095). An [article](https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/2023/03/28/general-dynamics-unit-puts-short-range-air-defense-on-robotic-vehicle/) from March talks about the specifics a bit more. I don't know if GDLS did the mock up, but the Army also presented a concept for an [unmanned tank](https://twitter.com/ronkainen7k15/status/1710278736543674575?s=20) with a 120mm cannon.\n\nBAE showed off their AMPV with a C-UAS configuration. Here's a [press release](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/article/bae-systems-showcases-armored-multi-purpose-vehicle-enhancements-at-ausa-clearing-the-way-for-future-variants) and an [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8B2f7IWUAAtHTD?format=jpg&name=large). As posted yesterday (or a couple of days ago), they also showed the M109-52, which uses Rheinmetall's L52 155mm, 52-caliber cannon. Here's their [press release](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/article/bae-systems-successfully-tests-m109-self-propelled-howitzer-modified-with-52-caliber-cannon) and an [image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8B2m-uW0AAOUex?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nSpeaking of Rheinmetall, it showed off its own [robot C-UAS](https://www.rheinmetall.com/en/media/news-watch/news/2023/10/2023-10-09-american-rheinmetall-unveils-30mm-cannon-mobile-cuas) that combined the Skyranger 30mm turret on Textron Systems\u2019 Ripsaw M5 RCV. Here's a [picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8EGq8nagAA4-wF?format=jpg&name=small) from the event.\n\nFinally, EOS (who makes the Slinger system) showcased their new [R800 RWS](https://twitter.com/RyszardJonski/status/1711994173564293238?s=20). It is equipped with a Mk44S Bushmaster 30 mm automatic cannon, an M240B 7.62 mm M240B machine gun, and a 1 kW laser capable of blinding the optics of small drones.

There have been a lot of interesting concept vehicles presented. </p>\n\n<p>GDLS showed off their <a href=\"https://www.gdls.com/trx/\">Tracked Robot 10-ton (TRX)</a> configured for SHORAD; particularly C-UAS <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8B2bb-WgAE10rK?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">(image)</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ronkainen7k15/status/1709913932981494095\">(video)</a>. An <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/2023/03/28/general-dynamics-unit-puts-short-range-air-defense-on-robotic-vehicle/\">article</a> from March talks about the specifics a bit more. I don&#39;t know if GDLS did the mock up, but the Army also presented a concept for an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ronkainen7k15/status/1710278736543674575?s=20\">unmanned tank</a> with a 120mm cannon.</p>\n\n<p>BAE showed off their AMPV with a C-UAS configuration. Here&#39;s a <a href=\"https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/article/bae-systems-showcases-armored-multi-purpose-vehicle-enhancements-at-ausa-clearing-the-way-for-future-variants\">press release</a> and an <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8B2f7IWUAAtHTD?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">image</a>. As posted yesterday (or a couple of days ago), they also showed the M109-52, which uses Rheinmetall&#39;s L52 155mm, 52-caliber cannon. Here&#39;s their <a href=\"https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/article/bae-systems-successfully-tests-m109-self-propelled-howitzer-modified-with-52-caliber-cannon\">press release</a> and an <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8B2m-uW0AAOUex?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">image</a></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of Rheinmetall, it showed off its own <a href=\"https://www.rheinmetall.com/en/media/news-watch/news/2023/10/2023-10-09-american-rheinmetall-unveils-30mm-cannon-mobile-cuas\">robot C-UAS</a> that combined the Skyranger 30mm turret on Textron Systems\u2019 Ripsaw M5 RCV. Here&#39;s a <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8EGq8nagAA4-wF?format=jpg&amp;name=small\">picture</a> from the event.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, EOS (who makes the Slinger system) showcased their new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyszardJonski/status/1711994173564293238?s=20\">R800 RWS</a>. It is equipped with a Mk44S Bushmaster 30 mm automatic cannon, an M240B 7.62 mm M240B machine gun, and a 1 kW laser capable of blinding the optics of small drones. As a system, it can be mounted to many different types of vehicles. </p>\n\n<p>Somewhat predictable, but smaller, cheaper C-UAS and unmanned vehicles from tanks to trucks seem to be growing more prominent.</p>\n</div>",

So they will keep the tempo up and, of course, try to exploit any situations and retake the initiative.\n\nThat's what I'm questioning. Going on the offensive is very likely a worse way to attrite the ukranians then simply trying to optimize the defense, using the extensive network of fortifications they've built. It's pretty consensual that attacking armies usually take more attrition than defending ones. \n\n>I don't think that's the case, there's no indication that they plan to reduce the intensity of this conflict.\n\nThere are indications.

                            "body": "I think you're right about lack of offensive capabilities, but I don't think this is primarily the fault of the line units themselves that have issues conducting offensive ops, it's probably their chain of commands that have the most trouble. \n\nAt the end of the day, Avdiivka is a legit fortress and the current lines are built on some pretty defensible ground. It's probably one of Ukraine's strongest positions in the country. Taking it is no joke. \n\nFor this attack, the Russians tried what looks like a concentric encirclement. A dual thrust on both sides of the salient to strike at the same time, two simultaneous combined arms breaches, plus probably some supporting attacks too. That means a highly choreographed operation involving multiple brigade sized motorized rifle/tank units, plus lots of artillery, plus EW and all sorts of other support enablers, all serving under a unified commander. \n\nThat means the plan had to be a top down affair, written up by what was probably the command and staff of at least a division but more likely a combined arms army (or whatever equivalent is running that sector). In the Russian system, using a centralized command system (Directives Command, the opposite of Mission Command), the higher level headquarters responsible for the operation spells out the exact role of every unit involved and then disseminates orders downwards, exactly as they are to be done, with the junior commanders only responsible for the command and staff functions of their roles. Hence why Russian (and Ukrainian who realistically still use the same method) have such small staffs at the brigade and battalion level, they don't need to plan much it's done by higher headquarters.\n\nThe disaster at Vulhedar over the winter apparently happened this way, a higher level HQ planned the operation to the T, but it was a bad plan because they missed some parts that turned out to be important. Maybe something that lower level leadership might have caught or recommended had they had a say. All it takes is a tiny amount of errors in those types of operations and the whole thing might be a bust, and often the high HQ, further away from the front lines, aren't the ones with the most accurate picture of the reality on the ground. \n\nThe Russian higher level headquarters running this operation were probably stoked about the success of it, thinking it was brilliantly planned. Being that it's the Russian system, and because biting off the Avdiivka salient would be a huge deal but a risk while the UAF offensive is still ongoing, Gerasimov surely blessed it off as both the SMO commander and Chief of the General Staff. Which means that staff also reviewed it (likely making their own changes, because that's the reality, everyone in charge likes sticking their dirty, grubby fingers in the pie because they can). \n\nSo without knowing anything else, the plan probably was highly flawed but carried out to the letter anyway because that's how their system works. Only Wagner had the power to use Mission Command, supposedly the VKS maybe too, but not the Russian Ground Forces, VDV, or MP. \n\nBeing that their success requires really solid planning, which commands are probably the best at planning these sorts of operations? Where are the Russian stud commanders and staff at? Probably not running the Avdiivka sector.\n\nWhich brings us back to the troops. \n\nWith a good plan that is both realistic and executed as it was planned, even with mediocre troops it can work. Even with bad troops it can work if they use enough fires and are taking a cautious and slow approach. But given a bad plan that is overly complicated and requires near perfect coordination to work, line units that are poorly trained, organized, and led are screwed. \n\nSucceeding despite a bad plan requires line units and intermediary command and staff to react fast and well, adopt and improvise, to possess cohesion, trust, teamwork, good morale, discipline, and the know-how to perform complex tasks under incredibly stressful situations, able to think on their feet and communicate effectively to pull off miracles.\n\nWe don't know yet who actually spearheaded these attacks. But I bet it wasn't actually good units that are legitimately qualified for offensive operations, assuming that even includes VDV or MP at this point. I also bet they didn't adequately train or rehearse either, which is absolutely critical to even successfully execute a good plan. But even if they did, there is a very good chance that if they followed a bad plan for an operation this complex, it probably wouldn't work. A division plus sized dual breach requiring tactical surprise is not Keep It Simple Stupid.",

That means a highly choreographed operation involving multiple brigade sized motorized rifle/tank units, plus lots of artillery, plus EW and all sorts of other support enablers, all serving under a unified commander. </p>\n\n<p>That means the plan had to be a top down affair, written up by what was probably the command and staff of at least a division but more likely a combined arms army (or whatever equivalent is running that sector). In the Russian system, using a centralized command system (Directives Command, the opposite of Mission Command), the higher level headquarters responsible for the operation spells out the exact role of every unit involved and then disseminates orders downwards, exactly as they are to be done, with the junior commanders only responsible for the command and staff functions of their roles. Hence why Russian (and Ukrainian who realistically still use the same method) have such small staffs at the brigade and battalion level, they don&#39;t need to plan much it&#39;s done by higher headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>The disaster at Vulhedar over the winter apparently happened this way, a higher level HQ planned the operation to the T, but it was a bad plan because they missed some parts that turned out to be important. Maybe something that lower level leadership might have caught or recommended had they had a say. All it takes is a tiny amount of errors in those types of operations and the whole thing might be a bust, and often the high HQ, further away from the front lines, aren&#39;t the ones with the most accurate picture of the reality on the ground. </p>\n\n<p>The Russian higher level headquarters running this operation were probably stoked about the success of it, thinking it was brilliantly planned. Being that it&#39;s the Russian system, and because biting off the Avdiivka salient would be a huge deal but a risk while the UAF offensive is still ongoing, Gerasimov surely blessed it off as both the SMO commander and Chief of the General Staff. Which means that staff also reviewed it (likely making their own changes, because that&#39;s the reality, everyone in charge likes sticking their dirty, grubby fingers in the pie because they can). </p>\n\n<p>So without knowing anything else, the plan probably was highly flawed but carried out to the letter anyway because that&#39;s how their system works. Only Wagner had the power to use Mission Command, supposedly the VKS maybe too, but not the Russian Ground Forces, VDV, or MP. </p>\n\n<p>Being that their success requires really solid planning, which commands are probably the best at planning these sorts of operations? Where are the Russian stud commanders and staff at? Probably not running the Avdiivka sector.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings us back to the troops. </p>\n\n<p>With a good plan that is both realistic and executed as it was planned, even with mediocre troops it can work. Even with bad troops it can work if they use enough fires and are taking a cautious and slow approach. But given a bad plan that is overly complicated and requires near perfect coordination to work, line units that are poorly trained, organized, and led are screwed. </p>\n\n<p>Succeeding despite a bad plan requires line units and intermediary command and staff to react fast and well, adopt and improvise, to possess cohesion, trust, teamwork, good morale, discipline, and the know-how to perform complex tasks under incredibly stressful situations, able to think on their feet and communicate effectively to pull off miracles.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t know yet who actually spearheaded these attacks. But I bet it wasn&#39;t actually good units that are legitimately qualified for offensive operations, assuming that even includes VDV or MP at this point. I also bet they didn&#39;t adequately train or rehearse either, which is absolutely critical to even successfully execute a good plan. But even if they did, there is a very good chance that if they followed a bad plan for an operation this complex, it probably wouldn&#39;t work. A division plus sized dual breach requiring tactical surprise is not Keep It Simple Stupid.</p>\n</div>",

I understand that several reasons were part of the story behind Russia doing far worse in the initial stages of the invasion than expected such as corruption, faulty strategy, underestimation of Ukraine's will etc. but I don't understand how any of these factors could've caused it to act so incredibly callously when it comes to securing its own communications.

There\u2019s a very long and complicated history between the two sides; even without getting into that, the unimaginably cruel violence Hamas unleashed has opened up Pandora\u2019s Box. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say Israel just went through their version of 9/11. They can\u2019t just ignore what\u2019s up until now, been behind the wall and have mobilized their army to commit to dealing with the threat. \n\nOutside of Hamas and a few fringe psychopaths, I don\u2019t think anyone really wants civilians caught in the crossfire. The main problem is that no one wants Palestinians. \n\nEgypt already closed their border and is refusing to house refugees. They already have an active insurgency in the Sinai and having two million hungry, disgruntled people with Hamas fighters mixed in is a problem they don\u2019t want to deal with. \n\nMoving them through or housing them in Israel just isn\u2019t possible after Saturday.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say Israel just went through their version of 9/11. They can\u2019t just ignore what\u2019s up until now, been behind the wall and have mobilized their army to commit to dealing with the threat. </p>\n\n<p>Outside of Hamas and a few fringe psychopaths, I don\u2019t think anyone really wants civilians caught in the crossfire. The main problem is that no one wants Palestinians. </p>\n\n<p>Egypt already closed their border and is refusing to house refugees. They already have an active insurgency in the Sinai and having two million hungry, disgruntled people with Hamas fighters mixed in is a problem they don\u2019t want to deal with. </p>\n\n<p>Moving them through or housing them in Israel just isn\u2019t possible after Saturday.

For Hamas militants, it was a constant process of \"Do I kill/torture/rape/kidnap these helpless civilians or not?\", and then continually proceeding to do so, at a mass, organized level, and then publicly gloating about it (with not an inconsiderable number of their backers joining).\n\nThis is what makes the last attack so outrageous, as opposed to usual rocket launches or even the last Intifada.\n\n(2) Precisely for that moral reason above, I think people are underestimating Israeli resolve. The last few COINs, not to mention the Russian invasion of Ukraine, haven't gone well, so there is a natural tendency to assume Israel will fail or give up as well. \n\nIt is true that this war's only parallel is the Israeli invasion of Southern Lebanon.

In the West, you need political will to support Ukraine and that may falter. In this very thread we're discussing how difficult it is to give more money to Ukraine even though it's the best bang of the buck of all time AND it has bipartisan support. \n\nIn Europe, the worsening economic situation makes people elect people like Fico in Slovakia a week ago who are ostensibly anti-Ukraine support. Poland is going to have an election, and it's very realistic that PiS will need to make a coalition with Konfederacja which might compromise aid. In Austria, the far right and Russia-friendly FP\u00d6 is the strongest polling party currently. AFD in Germany is rising as well ...\n\nOn the other side, Putin has the political power to pour more into the war even though it fucks up Russia more in relative terms.\n\nIt's all good if you want to bleed and cripple Russia, but veery uncertain if your goal is actually peace for Ukraine.",
