[This lengthy and detailed article](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/iraqs-new-regime-change-how-tehran-backed-terrorist-organizations-and-militias-captured-the-iraqi-state/) from Westpoint's Combating Terrorism Center, published just last month, is a great look at the militias recent history.

In fact, their relative defeat in the October 2021 parliamentary elections was seen as possibly a death blow. \n* In the ~2 years since, some very cool-headed legal and political maneuvering, combined with questionable moves by Moqtada al-Sadr to withdraw his legislators in protest, led to the abrupt return of the militias and their political parties in October 2022, which now have basically uncontested control of the Iraqi state for the next few years. The Prime Minster, al-Sudani, was picked by the militia network parties, they control the legislature, and have de-facto control of the judiciary.  \n* The military and economic power of the militia network dwarfs that of their allies, other than Iran; hundreds of thousands of fighters, increasingly integrated into the formal Iraqi state and military, including into its intelligence/signals apparatus, access to US weapons and training on top of Iranian weapons and training, and perhaps most importantly, a colossal budget underwritten by oil revenues - ~$50 billion/year, compared with Hezbollah and Ansarallahs' operational budgets of $2 billion/year. \n* The militia network is relatively pragmatic, despite the strong ideological drive to expel the US from Iraq, everybody has been more or less restrained, and amenable to keeping the US in the country as long as benefits accrue (training, plus backup for any Islamic State resurgence), although now with the Israel-Palestine war flaring up, the question is back on the table\n* Overall, this seems like a massive strategic defeat for the US; notwithstanding its ability to assassinate leaders here and there, there doesn't seem to be any reasonable course of action the US can take to untangle Iran and the militia network from the Iraqi state, short of some kind of civil war and a return to hostile footing.",

They put up some statistics on FPV uses by both sides and Lancet by the Russians. It should be noted that main shortcoming of the study is that its hard to know what percentage of strikes are actually successful as mostly only those are shown. The Ukrainians claim about 60% for both sides but the Russians interestingly claim 10% for the Ukrainians. Which would be interesting because that would mean there are actually way more Ukrainian drones being produced if this data represents only 10% of what they send out. Here are some of their conclusions:\n\n>1. Speculation from around spring of 2023 that Russia would achieve dominance in the production of FPV and Lancet drones has not translated into numerically superior numbers of combat strikes. Despite this, some might argue that Russia is yet to use its FPV stocks and has in fact retained this weaponry in storage. Nevertheless, in an attritional war such as this one, any low-cost, widely available weapon that can destroy high-value targets should be expected to be utilized when needed by either side. This rationale was evidenced in Ukraine\u2019s heavy use of its own FPV drones, due particularly to its notable lack of large caliber mortar and artillery shells.\n\n>2. The Russian Lancet drone has not proved as effective as previously thought. It is clearly capable against lightly armored vehicles and valuable equipment such as radar. However, both its cost and Ukraine\u2019s effective use of decoys to neuter this threat have seen it become a less practical strike option than cheaper FPVs.\n\n>3. Ukraine has demonstrated the capability of consistently delivering FPV drones to the front line. However, more are clearly needed to save their own stocks of artillery shells, currently used parsimoniously, for future offensive maneuvers. It is also important to highlight that the Ukrainian army has been successful in consistently training new FPV operators, as it managed previously for operators of older drone types. This will likely lead to Ukraine\u2019s retention of such dominance and a lower likelihood of it losing experienced drone operators, whose Russian opposite numbers are a primary target for Ukrainian FPV drone strikes.\n\n>To conclude, amongst the Kremlin\u2019s most effective and consistent weapons in its arsenal has been propaganda and its influence on both Ukraine and her western allies. Nonetheless, a careful examination of reliable, existing, data exists as a means to counteract this particular weapon, enabling the observer to see through a fog of war which Moscow would prefer to see opaque.\n\nInterestingly they separately also made some other remarks. First, Andrew Perpetua is of the opinion that Russia is using FPVs to hit bunkers, sometimes using 20 to 30 drones on the same structure. He says this causes the Ukrainians to retreat but not take casualties other than concussions.  He says Ukrainians are using it to hit vehicles, which results in Russian casualties but Russians are not as sensitive to those. Essentially both sides are using them correctly for the purpose of their task. The main author who is an expert on drone systems says claims of Russians industrializing FPV production aren't real, at least yet. He says both sides are doing it at the hobbyist level, but the Russians are still behind in terms of final assembly. He thinks the soldering work on Russian FPV drones is poor right now. The Russians are also lagging behind less than they did before but they aren't at Ukrainian levels either counter to perception. Lastly, they are also saying a lot of claims on Russia significantly outproducing FPV drones is based on anecdotes (they said something about a Ukrainian officer claimed a 7:1 Russian advantage in drones in his sector but people have started using that as a basis for all analysis on FPV drones).",

Nevertheless, in an attritional war such as this one, any low-cost, widely available weapon that can destroy high-value targets should be expected to be utilized when needed by either side. This rationale was evidenced in Ukraine\u2019s heavy use of its own FPV drones, due particularly to its notable lack of large caliber mortar and artillery shells.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Russian Lancet drone has not proved as effective as previously thought. It is clearly capable against lightly armored vehicles and valuable equipment such as radar. However, both its cost and Ukraine\u2019s effective use of decoys to neuter this threat have seen it become a less practical strike option than cheaper FPVs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ukraine has demonstrated the capability of consistently delivering FPV drones to the front line. However, more are clearly needed to save their own stocks of artillery shells, currently used parsimoniously, for future offensive maneuvers. It is also important to highlight that the Ukrainian army has been successful in consistently training new FPV operators, as it managed previously for operators of older drone types. This will likely lead to Ukraine\u2019s retention of such dominance and a lower likelihood of it losing experienced drone operators, whose Russian opposite numbers are a primary target for Ukrainian FPV drone strikes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To conclude, amongst the Kremlin\u2019s most effective and consistent weapons in its arsenal has been propaganda and its influence on both Ukraine and her western allies. Nonetheless, a careful examination of reliable, existing, data exists as a means to counteract this particular weapon, enabling the observer to see through a fog of war which Moscow would prefer to see opaque.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly they separately also made some other remarks. First, Andrew Perpetua is of the opinion that Russia is using FPVs to hit bunkers, sometimes using 20 to 30 drones on the same structure. He says this causes the Ukrainians to retreat but not take casualties other than concussions.  He says Ukrainians are using it to hit vehicles, which results in Russian casualties but Russians are not as sensitive to those. Essentially both sides are using them correctly for the purpose of their task. The main author who is an expert on drone systems says claims of Russians industrializing FPV production aren&#39;t real, at least yet. He says both sides are doing it at the hobbyist level, but the Russians are still behind in terms of final assembly. He thinks the soldering work on Russian FPV drones is poor right now. The Russians are also lagging behind less than they did before but they aren&#39;t at Ukrainian levels either counter to perception. Lastly, they are also saying a lot of claims on Russia significantly outproducing FPV drones is based on anecdotes (they said something about a Ukrainian officer claimed a 7:1 Russian advantage in drones in his sector but people have started using that as a basis for all analysis on FPV drones).</p>\n</div>",

Orcslayersky will pop up on a report when he officially joins that unit. He might have more surgeries. Etc.\n\nFortunately, Orcslayersky's health improves, he regains full motor function. Physical therapy gets him strong again. So in December 2023, he returns to duty.

I don't see any indication where this is supposed to be leaked information - per his own words again, it's a *rough* understanding. I scratch my head as why ABC News would reference a low quality secondhand source here.

Monthly production capacity output can't remotely keep up with UAF demand, and won't even have a chance until at least 2025. Which means the only other sources are existing stockpiles, which were largely used up already in the last two years.\n\nJust look at Russia as an example. They had a massive prewar stockpile that they consumed most of already. They dumped the funds to raise up arty production capacity earlier in the war that the West did but it's not enough at the moment. They already tapped into Belarus'' stockpiles, and now they bought at least a million rounds from North Korea to hold them over, with the potential likely to get more, since the supposed deal with North Korea involves technology transfers that will be more valuable to Kim's regime than  HE arty rounds\n\nWhere is Ukraine going to get millions more arty rounds from in 2024 which is the only way they can overcome their shortage? Who still has a massive stockpile that is willing to give it up? \n\nThe US can't give more from its war reserve stocks, we are already dangerously low and future production is likely going to prioritize Ukraine. Most of Europe gave beyond the dangerous level. Turkey, Pakistan, South Korea have all given from their stockpiles. \n\nA few months back there were talks to try to get into the Greek stockpiles, but I've not heard anything about that since November, and that was only 75k, which isn't a lot considering Ukraine needs 2.5 million a year just to fire around 7k/shells per day. \n\nFor the summer offensive they out shot the Russians at 10k/day, but since the Russian arty shortage has lessened they'd need more to gain fires overwatch, which would be critical to offensive success in this type of war. So let's say Russia can sustain 10k/day from this point forward, which is a far cry from their supposed 40-60k/day in summer 2022. That's 3.6 million per year, and the Ukrainians need to exceed that to have fire superiority like they did over the summer (which still didn't lead to success).",

Sometimes they work, but when they do it's usually more about other factors that weren't considered, or blind luck of a \"broken clock being right\" type.\n\nI would say that this war proved to be a war that was heavily influenced by misconceptions and false beliefs(Even from higher figures such as Petraeus and Ben Hodges), while Russia thought that they were going to take Kiev in a few days and the Ukrainians wouldn't fight, many in the western audiences and probably some Ukrainians believe the opposite, that the Russians were about to collapse, either by social issues or economic problems, the russian soldier had poor morale and wasn't willing to stand and fight, or that the russian industry couldn't adapt and increase their military production. At the end, everybody had unrealistic views.\n\nAnd i totally agree with the last part, i'm not saying one side is winning, if the lines will frozen in the future or if any side will collapse, but if you draw an strategy hoping that you will win because of false assumption about your enemy, there is a very high chance you will get punched in the face.",
