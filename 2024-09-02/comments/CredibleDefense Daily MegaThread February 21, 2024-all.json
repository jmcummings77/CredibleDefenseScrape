Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

All three can sting the West very painfully, but in every avenue of warfare the West has complete and total escalation dominance, up to and including \"wining\" a full scale nuclear war - or any type of conventional war. Both sides know this and nothing that happens on the ground will change that. This gives the West a truly massive amount of stratetgic depth to spend on trying to minimze escalation if that seems useful, and there's very little cost here ultimately (to NATO+, obviously it sucks for Ukraine). \n\n2) Seeing this as a West v. Russia conflict right now is missing the big picture - which is China. Unlike Russia China can seriously threaten NATO+ in non-pyrrhic ways. Ultimately over escalating and dragging China in (even if Iran and DPRK were inevitable) as a weapons supplier is disastrous. But more generally everything from the Afghanistan withdrawal to now feels like an effort to prepare for a confrontation with China - beyond simple resource expenditures I suspect there is an effort all across the Global South to court allies (or at least netraulity) when it happens. Underescalating v. Russia/Iran, and pressuring Isreal to stand down both make sense in this context. On a similar note managing War Weariness in Western populations has to be a major concern, similar to the WW2 example most Western populations don't want to fight a war - if we end up say fighting Iran will there be any will left at all to defend Taiwan a year later?

When farmers complain about prices in interviews, they often compare the current prices with the prices during the >100% price increase in 2021-2022.\n\nFor example, let's look at the wheat market. Here's a chart of sale prices of wheat for human consumption (i.e. not animal feed) in Poland in the period 2012-2024: https://i.imgur.com/Gh5Kp2p.png (source: agrolok.pl)\n\nAs you can see, in 2012-2021 period the price was mostly stable at ~700-800 PLN level, in 2021-2022 there was a sudden increase to 1500-2000 PLN and then it returned to ~780 PLN. However, it should be noted that due to high inflation, the purchasing power of this amount is lower than it was in 2021.\n\nBy the way, the increase started a year *before* the war in Ukraine. It's difficult to point to a single cause, but certainly the war and the port blockades were the reason why the increase reached such a high level.\n\nThe current decrease isn't just in Poland or Europe, this is a worldwide market trend: https://i.imgur.com/vH9la2d.png (source: [IGC](https://www.igc.int/en/markets/marketinfo-goi.aspx), wheat sub-index).\n\nGrain imports from Ukraine have been banned in Poland starting from May 2023. Banning Ukrainian wheat imports across the whole EU would probably raise local prices, but I wouldn't expect a complete reversal of global market trends.\n\nThere's more data on the EU grain market here: \n\nhttps://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/data-and-analysis/markets/overviews/market-observatories/crops/cereals-statistics_en\n\nSome selected facts:\n\n- Yearly production of wheat in the EU is ~125 million tons.\n\n- Import from Ukraine in 2021/22 season was ~0.3 million tons, in 2022/2023 it grew to ~6 million tons (season is a 12-month period starting from July).\n\n- The biggest importers of wheat in the EU (mainly, but not exclusively from Ukraine) in 2022/23 season were: Spain (41%), Italy (11%), Romania (10%), Poland (9%)\n\n- In the current 2023/24 season (which has not yet ended), the largest importers so far were: Spain (53%), Italy (13%), Greece (8%), Romania (6%)",
