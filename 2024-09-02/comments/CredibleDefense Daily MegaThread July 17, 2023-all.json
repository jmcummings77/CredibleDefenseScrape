Plus or minus a few centimeters depending on where the tide is, but the tidal height is tiny in that area so tidal effects are pretty minimal.

A senior Biden administration official said Lai\u2019s transit wouldn\u2019t go beyond precedent and would be low key, private and unofficial.\n\n>Taiwan will hold presidential elections in January and leading contenders usually visit the US before voters cast their ballots. Hou Yu-ih, the opposition Kuomintang\u2019s candidate, is expected to transit through the US sometime in the early autumn, the official said.\n\n>The US is committed to impartiality in the upcoming election, the official added, calling on Beijing not to interfere in the vote, or use the transit as a pretext for any coercion.\n\n>>Military Drills\n\n>Lai\u2019s visit is likely to provoke a reaction from Beijing. After President Tsai Ing-wen met House Speaker Kevin McCarthy during a similar transit in the US in April, the People\u2019s Liberation Army held major military drills around the democracy of some 23 million people.\n\n>The PLA also held exercises in August 2022 after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei \u2014 that military activity included sending missiles over Taiwan. The US criticized China\u2019s maneuvers, and President Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to protect Taiwan if it is invaded.\n\n>Last week, PLA warplanes made their biggest incursion into sensitive areas around Taiwan in three months while Pena visited Taipei. Paraguay is the only South American country to officially recognize Taiwan as a nation, and Pena said during his visit that he\u2019s \u201cdetermined\u201d to maintain the relationship. He\u2019s set to be sworn into office on Aug. 15.\n\n>Lai has gone to the US twice in recent years. In 2020, he visited Washington, meeting with Senator Marco Rubio, a critic of China\u2019s policies, and visiting officials at the National Security Council. He stopped in Los Angeles last year as part of a trip to Honduras, which later switched ties to Beijing.\n\n>The DPP candidate has consistently led polls in Taiwan, while Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People\u2019s Party and the KMT\u2019s Hou jostle for second place.\n\n>China blames the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for damaging cross-tensions by frequently having officials meeting with figures from other nations. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has refused to interact with Tsai because she doesn\u2019t accept Beijing\u2019s stance there is just \u201cone China.\u201d",

A senior Biden administration official said Lai\u2019s transit wouldn\u2019t go beyond precedent and would be low key, private and unofficial.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan will hold presidential elections in January and leading contenders usually visit the US before voters cast their ballots. Hou Yu-ih, the opposition Kuomintang\u2019s candidate, is expected to transit through the US sometime in the early autumn, the official said.</p>\n\n<p>The US is committed to impartiality in the upcoming election, the official added, calling on Beijing not to interfere in the vote, or use the transit as a pretext for any coercion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Military Drills</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lai\u2019s visit is likely to provoke a reaction from Beijing. After President Tsai Ing-wen met House Speaker Kevin McCarthy during a similar transit in the US in April, the People\u2019s Liberation Army held major military drills around the democracy of some 23 million people.</p>\n\n<p>The PLA also held exercises in August 2022 after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei \u2014 that military activity included sending missiles over Taiwan. The US criticized China\u2019s maneuvers, and President Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to protect Taiwan if it is invaded.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, PLA warplanes made their biggest incursion into sensitive areas around Taiwan in three months while Pena visited Taipei. Paraguay is the only South American country to officially recognize Taiwan as a nation, and Pena said during his visit that he\u2019s \u201cdetermined\u201d to maintain the relationship. He\u2019s set to be sworn into office on Aug. 15.</p>\n\n<p>Lai has gone to the US twice in recent years. In 2020, he visited Washington, meeting with Senator Marco Rubio, a critic of China\u2019s policies, and visiting officials at the National Security Council. He stopped in Los Angeles last year as part of a trip to Honduras, which later switched ties to Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>The DPP candidate has consistently led polls in Taiwan, while Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People\u2019s Party and the KMT\u2019s Hou jostle for second place.</p>\n\n<p>China blames the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for damaging cross-tensions by frequently having officials meeting with figures from other nations. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has refused to interact with Tsai because she doesn\u2019t accept Beijing\u2019s stance there is just \u201cone China.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The way it is now is the way that is acceptable to all parties, albeit grudgingly. To reject it, and thereby change the status quo, is a major escalation that will naturally have consequences. Pretending to respect the One China Policy is the price you pay for any kind of diplomatic relationship with China. Countries have been willing to pay that price for many years, and are still willing to pay it now. Because to be honest, nodding and smiling is not a very high price to pay for a relationship with an important player. Polite fictions are polite and fictional. \n\nYou cite the example of Hong Kong. China paid a price for it. It decided that price was acceptable, but that doesn't mean it came for free. The price for the US, or any third party country, would likely be a massive economic shock plus skyrocketing military tensions. The price for Taiwan would be blood. Now tell me, who is willing to pay that price?",

It will alleviate the risk of a Chasiv Yar push and as a side result AFU will most definitely try to keep the Siversk salient as reinforced as they can to keep a large buffer of territory between Kupyansk-Liman-Siversk in front of Slavyansk-Kramatorsk-Konstyantivka just in case of an Electric Boogaloo 2.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that I don\u2019t think either side has anything more left in the engine. It\u2019s been quite obvious from the tremendous casualties seen on both sides in Bakhmut campaign and the winter-summer \u201coffensives\u201d. Unless one of the countries throws the towel completely, manoeuvre warfare is over.</p>\n</div>",

Here are some general observations.\n\n(Note: More detailed analysis will be coming out by all of us in the coming weeks.)\n\nFirst off, we spoke to NCOs, officers, a number of brigade commanders (national guard & regular army) in the field plus senior intel & defense officials in Kyiv (alongside @DAlperovitch). \nCounteroffensive:\n\nBy and large this is an infantryman\u2019s fight (squad, platoon & company level) supported by artillery along most of the frontline. This has several implications: 1st: Progress is measured by yards/meters and not km/miles given reduced mobility. \n2nd: Mechanized formations are rarely deployed due to lack of enablers for maneuver. This includes insufficient quantities of de-mining equipment, air defenses, ATGMs etc. \n\nUkrainian forces have still not mastered combined arms operations at scale. Operations are more sequential than synchronized. This creates various problems for the offense & IMO is the main cause for slow progress. \n\nUkrainian forces by default have switched to a strategy of attrition relying on sequential fires rather than maneuver. This is the reason why cluster munitions are critical to extend current fire rates into the fall: weakening Russian defenses to a degree that enables maneuver.\n\nMinefields are a problem as most observers know. They confine maneuver space & slow advances. But much more impactful than the minefields per se on Ukraine\u2019s ability to break through Russian defenses is Ukraines inability to conduct complex combined arms operations at scale. \nLack of a comprehensive combined arms approach at scale makes Ukrainian forces more vulnerable to Russian ATGMs, artillery etc. while advancing. So it's not just about equipment. There\u2019s simply no systematic pulling apart of the Russian defensive system that I could observe. \n\nThe character of this offensive will only likely change if there is a more systematic approach to breaking through Russian defenses, perhaps paired with or causing a severe degradation of Russian morale, that will lead to a sudden or gradual collapse of Russian defenses. \nAbsent a sudden collapse of Russian defenses, I suspect this will remain a bloody attritional fight with reserve units being fed in incrementally in the coming weeks & months. \n\nThere is limited evidence of a systematic deep battle that methodically degrades Russian C2/munitions. Despite rationing on the Russian side, ammunition is available and Russians appear to have fairly good battlefield ISR coverage. \nRussians also had no need to deploy operational reserves yet to fend off Ukrainian attacks.There is also evidence of reduced impact of HIMARS strikes due to effective Russian countermeasures. (This is important to keep in mind re. any potential tac. impact of delivery of ATACMs.) \n\nRussian forces, even if severely degraded & lacking ammo, are likely capable of delaying, containing or repulsing individual platoon- or company-sized Ukrainian advances unless these attacks are better coordinated & synchronized along the broader frontline. \n\nQuality of Russian forces varies. Attrition is hitting them hard but they are defending their positions well, according to Ukrainians we spoke to. They have been quite adaptable at the tactical level and are broadly defending according to Soviet/Russian doctrine. \n\nRussian artillery rationing is real & happening. Ukraine has established fire superiority in tube artillery while Russia retains superiority in MRLSs in the South. Localized fire superiority in some calibers alone does not suffice, however, to break through Russian defenses. \n\nAn additional influx of weapons systems (e.g., ATACMs, air defense systems, MBTs, IFVs etc.) while important to sustain the war effort, will likely not have a decisive tactical impact without adaptation and more effective integration. \nUkraine will have to better synchronize & adapt current tactics, without which western equipment will not prove tac. decisive in the long run. This is happening but it is slow work in progress. (Most NATO-style militaries would struggle with this even more than the Ukraines IMO). \n\nThe above is also true for breaching operations. Additional mine clearing equipment is needed & will be helpful (especially man-portable mine-clearing systems) but not decisive without better integration of fire & maneuver at scale. \n\n(Again, I cannot emphasize enough how difficult this is to pull off in wartime.)\n\nMonocausal explanations for failure (like lack of de-mining equipment) do not reflect reality. E.g., some Ukrainian assaults were stopped by Russian ATGMs even before reaching the 1st Russian minefield. \n\nThere is a dearth of artillery barrels that is difficult to address given production rates and delivery timelines. \n\nSo far Ukraine\u2019s approach in this counteroffensive has been first and foremost direct assaults on Russian positions supported by a rudimentary deep battle approach. And no, these direct assaults are not mere probing attacks. \n\nThere is evidence of tactical cyber operations supporting closing of kinetic kill-chains. That is cyber ISR contributing to identifying & tracking targets on the battlefield. Starlink remains absolutely key for Ukrainian C2. \n\nQuality of Ukrainian officers and NCOs we met appears excellent & morale remains high. However, there are some force quality issues emerging with less able bodied & older men called up for service now. \n\nThe narrative that Ukrainian progress thus far is slow just because of a lack of weapons deliveries and support is monocausal & is not shared by those we spoke to actually fighting & exercising command on the frontline. \n\nIt goes without saying that in a war of attrition, more artillery ammunition & hardware is always needed and needs to be steadily supplied. (Western support of Ukraine certainly should continue as there is still the prospect that the counteroffensive will make gains.) \nBut soldiers fighting on the frontline we spoke to are all too aware that lack of progress is often more due to force employment, poor tactics, lack of coordination btw. units, bureaucratic red tape/infighting, Soviet style thinking etc. & ...Russians putting up stiff resistance.",

        "body": "Just now I saw this [video](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1680937552864243712) and the Scooby-Doo vans made me think back to an [interview](https://www.analisidifesa.it/2023/04/reportage-dal-donbass-avdiivka-la-battaglia-infinita/) from April I had read some time ago and that was never discussed. Disclaimer: it's in Italian language; it's a heavily pro-Russian interview with numerous instances of straight up propaganda, but I think it's interesting because there are a few lines of honesty about the situation and the issues and what I like about these interviews is that they allow us to understand how the other side thinks.\n\nThe interviewed are members of the Pyatnashka Brigade, a (I guess) battalion-sized unit founded by a volunteer from Abkhazia and manned by Russian volunteers (with a few foreign ones), operating (at least during the date of the interview) around Spartak/Opytne in the Avdiivka sector. It's a private unit part of former 100th Brigade of the DPR (in turn former DPR Republican Guard), now the 110th Brigade of the 1st Corps of the Southern Military District. Those who want to can read it all with a translator - I will select, summarizing them and adding my personal opinions, the highlights of the interview that I find interesting.\n\nFirst of all... The interviewer, with soldiers from the unit, reached a bunker near the frontline using an UAZ-452, aka Scooby-Doo's van. Why? I mean, even a BRDM-2 would be safer. The reason is admitted by the interviewed soldier: that van makes it possible to go from the staging areas to the line of contact more safely than doing that with an IFV/APC, as the Ukrainians avoid hitting these vans (at least unless they are unequivocally close to the frontline) for fear of hitting civilians moving in the outskirts of Donetsk. Unlike other cities, in fact Donetsk is still a heavily populated city with very tough battles (Avdiivka, Pervomaiske, Marinka) going on a handful of kilometers from its residential neighborhoods. Beyond the propaganda in this interview and without denying individual instances in which Ukrainians may have hit civilian targets, Ukrainians really do seem to be fighting with gloves on while near such a populated area. Let's think back to when it was the Russians fighting on the outskirts of a very large center (Kyiv, Kharkiv) and their terror shellings.\n\nThe Pyatnashka Brigade often changes its HQ building - at the time of the interview it was an abandoned factory, probably on the outskirts of Donetsk - for fear of being located and hit with GMLRS.\n\nWhat motivates a Russian to go to war as a volunteer? One volunteer in the article states he's convinced that either he was going to fight in Ukraine or in a while he would have to fight NATO on Moscow's doorstep. This is clearly a delusional take, but at the same time it makes us realize that for part of Russian society this is perceived as an existential war, unlike, for example, Afghanistan. Some time ago I was reading this [article](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/06/03/the-only-thing-worse-than-war-is-losing-one). Unfortunately, in addition to the whole segment of the population that hangs on Putin's lips and walks around with ZOV stickers, there also lots of Russians who even if on the surface are educated, open to the West, not supporters of their government... still don't want their country to lose the war, either out of national grandeur or fear of potential humiliation. I think this has to be well evaluated. I myself at the beginning of the war expected more major reactions from the Russian society and a greater and earlier war weariness, but it did not happen. There are of course individuals in Russia who protested against the war and did what they could and to whom my solidarity goes, but my 2 cents is that overall Russian society may be more psychologically ready than we'd like to think for a long war and to accept greater sacrifices, both economically and in terms of a larger mobilization, if they perceive their country to be in danger.\n\nThe men of the brigade complain that Russian artillery has little effect on Ukrainian positions in Avdiivka. The city is home to a very large coke plant, incidentally owned by the same group (Metinvest) that had Azovstal, which like the latter has an immense network of underground tunnels capable of resisting heavy bombings. The Ukrainians after 2015 expanded these tunnels and connected them to other buildings in the city. In fact, soldiers not deployed on the zero line, their dormitories, provisions, ammunition and spare parts depots... are almost all underground. This, in addition to the fortifications built in the surrounding countryside and Avdiivka's slightly elevated position is allowing the city to be an impregnable fortress for a year and a half now. They complain, as a result, that their drones see only a small part of Ukrainian activities. Drones they have had to buy with donations (although this on the other hand often happens in Ukrainian units as well). \n\nA very interesting point is that the myriad of Russian units (the Pyatnashka Brigade is - or was? - technically a private unit, although framed in a DPR brigade) are competing for scarce resources (armored vehicles, shells...). They also denounce the lack of coordination between the units and the lack of competence of the decision-maker officers at the operational level, who would not even know the positions they had ordered to assault. This is very important - Russia has this ball and chain of having so many historical DPR units, BARS, volunteer battalions sponsored by the Russian Oblasts, PMCs (the latters until last month) etc. that inevitably compete, which often results in rivalry; the problem of lack of coordination is very serious too. I think Ukraine should be commended because against odds it has managed to avoid this problem, with a process that began long ago, already after the battles of summer 2014, and maintained it despite the extreme surge in the number of soldiers after the invasion. Institutionalizing the Azov Regiment, framing volunteer units as motorized battalions in the regular brigades, other volunteer detachments were the base for several TDF units... Ditto for units composed of foreign volunteers such as the Georgian Legion in first place. This made it possible to maintain coordination and a clear vertical structure without pseudo-militias competing for resources and led by warlords with personality cults. That said, communication between Ukrainian brigades could still be improved and the absence of an intermediate-level permament structure between the brigades and the Operational Command of a certain front (net of the recently formed 10th Corps), primarily a divisional level, is being felt.\n\nDuring an offensive in the first half of February the soldiers complain of having lost \"countless men\" for \"a few meters gain.\" On February 7 alone, the interviewed soldiers' unit had 31 KIAs (described as among their best guys) due to Ukrainian shelling in an attempt to storm entrenched positions. The Italian interviewer then wrote about seeing a large number of coffins both inside and outside the Luhansk hospital, where he had passed earlier (I would not rule out that, given the date of the interview, Luhansk was a logistical hub for repatriations to Russia of the bodies of those killed in Bakhmut).\n\nGenerally speaking I think Avdiivka wider sector may be in the podium of the places with the most human losses for the Russians since the beginning of the conflict. The assaults against the city have seen the DPR units, such as Sparta and Somalia Battalions etc., bleeding dry, along with their best and bravest men, perhaps already volunteers before 2022 and with good knowledge of the terrain. I recall u/Glideer had flagged this in the past. Now the DPR army, integrated as a Russian Army's Corps, is very short of locals and has been enlisting mobilized men from Russia proper for months, with much less motivation and who from the looks of a few videos also seem to be treated with contempt by officers of former DPR units. \n\nAvdiivka is also one of the worst sectors if not perhaps the worst for the Russians in terms of cost/performance ratio since the beginning of the conflict. Huge losses for very little territory gained. The only noteworthy advance this year was the capture of Krasnohorivka north of the city, but the Ukrainians were able to halt progress and hold them off from the rail line. In all of this the Ukrainians certainly had and have casualties, but thanks to the physical advantages they have I am sure they were well below those of the Russians. An evidence of this is that Ukrainians in Avdiivka have a relatively small number of formations. In the recent period the Russians have slowed down offensive actions against the city, which has allowed the Ukrainians to deploy most of the battalions of the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades to Velyka Novosilka, whereas previously these brigades had been a very important part of the Avdiivka's UAF garrison for months.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Just now I saw this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1680937552864243712\">video</a> and the Scooby-Doo vans made me think back to an <a href=\"https://www.analisidifesa.it/2023/04/reportage-dal-donbass-avdiivka-la-battaglia-infinita/\">interview</a> from April I had read some time ago and that was never discussed. Disclaimer: it&#39;s in Italian language; it&#39;s a heavily pro-Russian interview with numerous instances of straight up propaganda, but I think it&#39;s interesting because there are a few lines of honesty about the situation and the issues and what I like about these interviews is that they allow us to understand how the other side thinks.</p>\n\n<p>The interviewed are members of the Pyatnashka Brigade, a (I guess) battalion-sized unit founded by a volunteer from Abkhazia and manned by Russian volunteers (with a few foreign ones), operating (at least during the date of the interview) around Spartak/Opytne in the Avdiivka sector. It&#39;s a private unit part of former 100th Brigade of the DPR (in turn former DPR Republican Guard), now the 110th Brigade of the 1st Corps of the Southern Military District. Those who want to can read it all with a translator - I will select, summarizing them and adding my personal opinions, the highlights of the interview that I find interesting.</p>\n\n<p>First of all... The interviewer, with soldiers from the unit, reached a bunker near the frontline using an UAZ-452, aka Scooby-Doo&#39;s van. Why? I mean, even a BRDM-2 would be safer. The reason is admitted by the interviewed soldier: that van makes it possible to go from the staging areas to the line of contact more safely than doing that with an IFV/APC, as the Ukrainians avoid hitting these vans (at least unless they are unequivocally close to the frontline) for fear of hitting civilians moving in the outskirts of Donetsk. Unlike other cities, in fact Donetsk is still a heavily populated city with very tough battles (Avdiivka, Pervomaiske, Marinka) going on a handful of kilometers from its residential neighborhoods. Beyond the propaganda in this interview and without denying individual instances in which Ukrainians may have hit civilian targets, Ukrainians really do seem to be fighting with gloves on while near such a populated area. Let&#39;s think back to when it was the Russians fighting on the outskirts of a very large center (Kyiv, Kharkiv) and their terror shellings.</p>\n\n<p>The Pyatnashka Brigade often changes its HQ building - at the time of the interview it was an abandoned factory, probably on the outskirts of Donetsk - for fear of being located and hit with GMLRS.</p>\n\n<p>What motivates a Russian to go to war as a volunteer? One volunteer in the article states he&#39;s convinced that either he was going to fight in Ukraine or in a while he would have to fight NATO on Moscow&#39;s doorstep. This is clearly a delusional take, but at the same time it makes us realize that for part of Russian society this is perceived as an existential war, unlike, for example, Afghanistan. Some time ago I was reading this <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/06/03/the-only-thing-worse-than-war-is-losing-one\">article</a>.

High altitude CAS is invulnerable to manpads and they can use the high altitude bombers to carpet bomb cities. \n\nMy point is this, if China can maintain air superiority over Taiwan, they don't need nearly as many amphibious assault ships. With that air superiority over the island (at least at high altitude), they can effectively blockade the island and stop any reinforcements from making it to the island. At that point, China could take their sweet time with an amphibious assault. \n\nYou are right, once the USN/USAF enters the fight, it would be difficult for China to maintain that air superiority. That is today where the US and allies have a major advantage in terms of numbers and quality of 5th generation fighter jets. So even if China could get short-term air superiority over Taiwan, eventually the USA would be able to push back against that and long range strikes on amphibious landing ships and essentially blockade Taiwan from the reinforcements. \n\nIn terms of the naval war for surface ships, it's won with air superiority - given China has enough anti-ship missiles to keep lobbing at US carrier task forces. Granted, US carriers have a lot of defense missiles, but eventually they'll run out and need to be resupplied. They can only be resupplied by going back to base. And China can run J20s from land bases on China to attack carrier groups within about 500-1000 miles of Taiwan (depending on specifics). So unless NATO can shoot down J20s and other standoff planes before they get in range of their anti-ship missiles, NATO ships are vulnerable to attack. The same is true for the Philippines and Okinawa. But, those air bases would be much more difficult to destroy and knock out compared to aircraft carriers. Carriers can be sunk, but craters can be filled in. \n\nAgain, naval sub-surface can be won with ASW aircraft. The strait of Taiwan is shallow and would be extremely difficult for a submarine to hide. So it would be quite difficult to use submarines to hit amphibious landing craft. \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to such a war. But if you look at it and if China can get up to about a 1-1 KD ratio of J20s to F35/F22s, and they make 120 of them a year for 5 more years, they can win the air war by around the end of the decade.",

Rosgvardia and FSB units with EW equipment are supposed to patrol around it, with boat units, and they have observation and defence points on both extremities (whose main mission is to control and inspect all cars going through though) as well as on the Tuzla islet in the middle. The boats are Grachonok anti-sabotage ships equiped with machine guns and mounted Igla MANPADS, as well as smaller armed patrol boats.\n\nUnderwater, there is a 24/7 presence of military divers. They apparently patrol and regularly inspect the bridge's pillars. There is also the \"Plavnik system\", movement detectors which can supposedly detect a diver or submerged drone as far as 2 kilometers away (and a ship/bigger drone at 3 km). If a detected diver approaches within 300 meters of the structure, underwater soundwaves are produced to repel him, and they increase in frequency as the diver approaches, forcing him to resurface and becoming potentially lethal within 100 meters (\"Amulet-P\" system). There are also trained dolphins (allegedly) which are supposed to be able to detect/attack threats at depths of up to 60 meters.\n\nAnd a 450km range Podsolnukh over-the-horizon coastal radar station. Project 436 decoy ships are also (or were) stationed around the bridge (if I understand correctly, they are meant to have important radar cross sections to attract homing missiles).\n\n(I'm no expert though, I'm just relaying what I read; I expect to be corrected on number of S400 systems by regiment or whatever.)",

Rosgvardia and FSB units with EW equipment are supposed to patrol around it, with boat units, and they have observation and defence points on both extremities (whose main mission is to control and inspect all cars going through though) as well as on the Tuzla islet in the middle. The boats are Grachonok anti-sabotage ships equiped with machine guns and mounted Igla MANPADS, as well as smaller armed patrol boats.</p>\n\n<p>Underwater, there is a 24/7 presence of military divers. They apparently patrol and regularly inspect the bridge&#39;s pillars. There is also the &quot;Plavnik system&quot;, movement detectors which can supposedly detect a diver or submerged drone as far as 2 kilometers away (and a ship/bigger drone at 3 km). If a detected diver approaches within 300 meters of the structure, underwater soundwaves are produced to repel him, and they increase in frequency as the diver approaches, forcing him to resurface and becoming potentially lethal within 100 meters (&quot;Amulet-P&quot; system). There are also trained dolphins (allegedly) which are supposed to be able to detect/attack threats at depths of up to 60 meters.</p>\n\n<p>And a 450km range Podsolnukh over-the-horizon coastal radar station. Project 436 decoy ships are also (or were) stationed around the bridge (if I understand correctly, they are meant to have important radar cross sections to attract homing missiles).</p>\n\n<p>(I&#39;m no expert though, I&#39;m just relaying what I read; I expect to be corrected on number of S400 systems by regiment or whatever.)</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Rail traffic has declined significantly since the October bombing but that has likely had a larger effect on the supplies available in the western end of the land bridge, where activity has been relatively light because of the natural defensive barrier posed by the Dnipro. Supplies into the land bridge via Mariupol are seemingly providing the bulk of material supporting defensive operations against the UAF offensives in Zaporizhzhia. \n\nProbably worth noting there have been a number of strikes on the few remaining rail depots the Russians have been using in eastern Kherson Oblast to offload cargo from Crimea, e.g. Yakymivka southwest of Melitopol. So even without a choke point at the Kerch strait, it doesn't seem like they have been able to move supplies freely over the neck of the Crimean Peninsula anyway, and what's making it through at this point is likely a trickle primarily being used to support the relatively less resource intensive screening operations on the left bank of the Dnipro from Nova Khakhovka south to the river delta.\n\nAlso the one rail line from Mariupol to Melitopol is only about 25-30km behind the Russian lines and so is subject to intermittent Ukrainian interdiction, whereas the roads along the Azov coast are out of HIMARS range still. [This is an older thread from NLwartracker that describes the rail logistics in the area well](https://twitter.com/NLwartracker/status/1616482420756254720), and notably the identified depots around the neck of the Crimean peninsula have all been struck in the intervening months. There really are not many places where the Russians can offload around the beck of the peninsula because the land is so marshy, and those places are generally established rail depot sites which the Ukrainians know to monitor and strike. Whereas the rail line in from Rostov via Mariupol passes through a lot of flat, dry terrain where ad hoc railheads can be established more easily. \n\nSo at the exact moment, I'm not sure about the precise breakdown but it's likely some percentage of their supplies are coming in via these lines of communication:\n\n- trucks (probably logistics units organic to whatever echelonment of combat formations the Russians are theoretically fighting with at this point) pulling from train depots or directly off the railhead near the front along the line between Mariupol and Melitopol, \n- combat units pulling directly off the railhead near the front along the line between Mariupol and Melitopol (e.g. SPGs pulling ammo from trains instead of from a dedicated ASP), \n- trucks (probably from the dedicated logistical technical support brigades) pulling from depots out of HIMARS range in Rostov, Crimea, or along the Azov Coast, including depots supplied via sea lanes over the Azov Sea to Berdyansk and other small ports along the coast as well as depots supplied by rail via Crimea or Rostov\n\nI suspect a really shocking percentage of Russian logistics are coming in via truck. Other than artillery ammunition, fuel, water, and replacement armored vehicles, it actually does not take much tonnage to supply your average combat unit. We can disregard fuel and water because the Russians should have redundant temporary pipelines from Rostov laid down by now and the only limiting factor should be tankers available for last mile delivery. Although no level of incompetence from the Russians would surprise me at this point, [the material-technical support brigades are in theory reputed to be able to establish full pipeline support within three or four days of taking a position](https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/), never mind after well over a year. Dry supplies for combat infantry, however, are only something like a single semi-truck per 1000 soldiers per day. I can't find a good source for where I originally found that figure, so the exact number might be wrong, but the main takeaway is that food and ammo supplies for infantry comprise a vanishingly small percentage of the total tonnage required to supply units in combat, especially in an artillery-centric military like Russia's.\n\nIn any case, I suspect that means the Russians are primarily trucking in light supplies via Rostov and the Azov coast roads out of range of most Ukrainian munitions, while using their sea lanes and the remaining rail connection via Mariupol to move heavy equipment and artillery ammunition either to depots along the coast out of HIMARS range or directly to combat units at rail sidings closer to the front. Direct delivery eliminates the need to offload ammo to a cleared and secured ASP where it would then sit, vulnerable to UAF Storm Shadow or HIMARS strikes for an indeterminate period of time, so makes sense for the constraints facing the Russians, especially with the only remaining reliable rail line so close to the front. Which makes it vulnerable to interdiction but also means the RuAF artillery units don't need to move out of place to pull from the rails, which in turn eliminates the need for more trucking to handle rail-to-ASP or ASP-to-combat-unit shipping. The flat terrain in Zaporizhzhia (unlike the marshy terrain around the neck of Crimea) leaves many ad hoc options for offloading, so the Russian trains just need to avoid predictable timing  for their deliveries or taking too long to offload in order to avoid being targeted by the UAF, because the Ukrainians can't maintain constant surveillance that far behind the lines at this point. I expect bringing the rail line within easy observation range (and thus complete fire control) for the Ukrainians is the current primary objective in the Zaporizhzhia area of operations, because doing so would disrupt the most important supply line for heavy ammunition into the land bridge, and because doing so is already a necessary preliminary step before any other operational objectives that would make sense for them (e.g. capturing Tokmak, Melitopol, or Berdyansk, or severing the landbridge).",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Rail traffic has declined significantly since the October bombing but that has likely had a larger effect on the supplies available in the western end of the land bridge, where activity has been relatively light because of the natural defensive barrier posed by the Dnipro. Supplies into the land bridge via Mariupol are seemingly providing the bulk of material supporting defensive operations against the UAF offensives in Zaporizhzhia. </p>\n\n<p>Probably worth noting there have been a number of strikes on the few remaining rail depots the Russians have been using in eastern Kherson Oblast to offload cargo from Crimea, e.g. Yakymivka southwest of Melitopol. So even without a choke point at the Kerch strait, it doesn&#39;t seem like they have been able to move supplies freely over the neck of the Crimean Peninsula anyway, and what&#39;s making it through at this point is likely a trickle primarily being used to support the relatively less resource intensive screening operations on the left bank of the Dnipro from Nova Khakhovka south to the river delta.</p>\n\n<p>Also the one rail line from Mariupol to Melitopol is only about 25-30km behind the Russian lines and so is subject to intermittent Ukrainian interdiction, whereas the roads along the Azov coast are out of HIMARS range still. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NLwartracker/status/1616482420756254720\">This is an older thread from NLwartracker that describes the rail logistics in the area well</a>, and notably the identified depots around the neck of the Crimean peninsula have all been struck in the intervening months. There really are not many places where the Russians can offload around the beck of the peninsula because the land is so marshy, and those places are generally established rail depot sites which the Ukrainians know to monitor and strike. Whereas the rail line in from Rostov via Mariupol passes through a lot of flat, dry terrain where ad hoc railheads can be established more easily. </p>\n\n<p>So at the exact moment, I&#39;m not sure about the precise breakdown but it&#39;s likely some percentage of their supplies are coming in via these lines of communication:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>trucks (probably logistics units organic to whatever echelonment of combat formations the Russians are theoretically fighting with at this point) pulling from train depots or directly off the railhead near the front along the line between Mariupol and Melitopol, </li>\n<li>combat units pulling directly off the railhead near the front along the line between Mariupol and Melitopol (e.g. SPGs pulling ammo from trains instead of from a dedicated ASP), </li>\n<li>trucks (probably from the dedicated logistical technical support brigades) pulling from depots out of HIMARS range in Rostov, Crimea, or along the Azov Coast, including depots supplied via sea lanes over the Azov Sea to Berdyansk and other small ports along the coast as well as depots supplied by rail via Crimea or Rostov</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I suspect a really shocking percentage of Russian logistics are coming in via truck. Other than artillery ammunition, fuel, water, and replacement armored vehicles, it actually does not take much tonnage to supply your average combat unit. We can disregard fuel and water because the Russians should have redundant temporary pipelines from Rostov laid down by now and the only limiting factor should be tankers available for last mile delivery.

Sure, some companies were able to do a secondary that would have failed otherwise, a few people got a little richer, a whole lot went broke, and perhaps the SEC pushed through some reviews a few months sooner than it would have anyway to give a good impression. But nothing changed on a fundamental level. It\u2019s also arguable whether that was trolling (beyond the typical trolliness of the sub) or more grassroots activism.

The position I would take if I had any power (which I don&#39;t, considering that I&#39;m posting here) is that Russia can shove it, so I presume that&#39;s also the position of the US, UK, EU states etc.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are spectators to this issue, and convincing them that Russia is in the wrong is also of interest to these actors. A position of &quot;Russia can shove it&quot; does not properly convince them that Russia&#39;s actions are unjustified. Instead, a position of &quot;We tried to be reasonable, Russia acted in bad faith, now Russia can shove it&quot; is much more convincing. </p>\n\n<p>The goal probably isn&#39;t to cave to Russia. Instead, I think the goal is to convince everyone else of the fact that Russia is very clearly in the wrong, so that Russia backs down and the problem goes away. These token concessions are IMO not attempts to cave to Russia, but instead attempts for Russia to make itself look bad.</p>\n</div>",

Why was there a shift? And are we going to see more of that?** \n\n>I think Israel is in a peculiar situation, different from say, Poland or Germany or France or any of the Western countries that are assisting Ukraine. First of all, we have a close military border with Russia. Our pilots are flying right next to Russian pilots over the skies of Syria.
