        "body": "If anyone is still interested about the war in Ukraine (just kidding!), I will try to make an update of the sectors along the frontline from a tactical point of view, including the order of battle (that we are aware of, of course we won't ever be able to know this stuff perfectly). The sources are the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets, Ukrainian think tank Centre for Defence Strategies, DeepState, WarArchive on Telegram... This will be the first of three parts and today I will be covering the north-eastern front (Kupyansk, Svatove, Kreminna). In the coming days I will talk about the eastern front (Siversk, Bakhmut, Horlivka, Avdiivka, Marinka) and then about the southern front (from Vuhledar to Kherson).\n\nFirst, what's going on along the Russian-Ukrainian border to the west of Kupyansk up to Belarus? Nothing much really. It has a very low force density, covered by elements of the TDF and border guard detachments for the Ukrainians; on the Russians' side, by the border guards, by Army's conscripts (I mean those from military service, not the mobilized) and by some volunteer battalions that are being created by the Russian oblasts located along the border. There are groups of saboteurs on both sides crossing the border, and occasional artillery exchanges and FPV drone attacks are taking place, mainly against trucks or defense installations.\n\nKupyansk. As a reminder, slightly more than 100k Russians should be deployed from here to the Siversky Donets River. The 25th and 138th Motorized Brigades of the 6th Army of the Western Military District, supported by regiments of the Territorial Forces and Storm Z detachments, are continuing to attack, as they have for months now. By far the biggest push is from Lyman Pershyi towards Synkivka, which remains firmly in Ukrainian hands. On Wednesday they would have recorded some tactical successes. In any case we are talking about very limited advances. The situation is not easy but Kupyansk at the moment has no structural holding problems in my view.\n\nAttacks are also taking place from Vilshana towards Petropavlivka. There are also fierce clashes for the \"Height 195\" near Orlyanske, which is one among several tactically important hills in the area. Attacks in this sector at the moment are mainly carried out by infantry (including lots of convicts from Storm Z) and aren't considerably mechanized, unlike elsewhere (partly because the area between Lyman Pershyi and Synkivka is, well, a forest). They are, however, supported by high volumes of artillery fire: there are reportedly five Russian artillery brigades in the Kupyansk sector.\n\nThe Ukrainian grouping in Kupyansk includes the 14th Mechanized Brigade, elements of the 95th Air Assault Brigade and the 67th Mech Brigade (with the rest of the elements of these two brigades deployed in the Kreminna sector), the new 41st Mech Brigade. Probably the 32nd Mech Brigade has also been transferred from Svatove very recently; certainly last month the 115th Mech Brigade arrived too, which was one of those that had completely disappeared from any radar during 2023. Elements of the TDF are present as well - Rybar stated there are battalions of the 101st and 105th Brigades. The 113th TDF Brigade is also supposed to be in the area. The political border with Russia west of the Oskil is manned by the Stalevy Kordon Brigade of the Offensive Guard.\n\nThe 95th Brigade is used (like the 25th) as \"firefighters\" in the north-eastern front, i.e., it operates in separate battalions to reinforce the hottest areas of the front in a given time. It's likely, by the way, that a company of the brigade is in the southern flank of Bakhmut.\n\nBetween Kupyansk and Svatove the entire 1st Tank Army (WMD) is deployed, i.e., the largest (excluding the 8th Army of the SMD which embedded the L/DPR forces) and on paper the most competent Russian formation in the Ground Forces (on paper - in Ukraine it has had embarrassing performances). \n\nAccording to Mashovets during this week the 153rd Tank Regiment (formed in Nizhny Novgorod) of the 47th Tank Division, part of the 1st GTA (this division had been created in late 2021 but had never been fully equipped) has arrived near the Russian-Ukrainian border crossing of Kantemirovka (Voronezh Oblast). The 153rd was created recently and would be fully equipped: 94 tanks, 32 IFVs, 12 D-30 122mm towed howitzers, and 140 trucks and special equipment. It's supposed to join the attacks towards Petropavlivka, where it will deployed along the 26th Tank Regiment of the same division. In Velykyi Vyselok, the 79th Motorized Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division (11th Corps - i.e. the Western MD's reserve) was recently deployed. \n\nThe 2nd Motorized Division and the 4th Tank Division (1st Tank Army) are, respectively: the former between Pershotravneve and Yahidne and the latter around the town of Svatove. Both have been involved and are involved in combat through local attacks in the areas they cover.\n\nHowever, I personally believe that the bulk of these two formations are still being restored. In addition to the losses in the first month of war (from Pryluky to Okhtyrka), during the Kharkiv counteroffensive of September 2022 (despite the fact that the troops were able to withdraw with somewhat limited human losses) they had simply enormous material losses, to the point that most of the battalions had almost no equipment left for real. Together with elements of the Central Military District they spent the winter in Belarus recovering, but we have no certainty about their current status. It's likely a relevant part of the T-90M / T-80BVM / BMP-3 that Russia manages to produce are going to re-equip the formations of the 1st GTA, but even on this there's no full certainty. In any case, to motorize their less capable units, Russia seems to be pulling quite a few BTR-70s from the warehouses recently, as stated by Russian sources. Which may be an indication that even BMP-1s are beginning to be treated more... judiciously. The appearance of MT-LBs (often modified) for offensive purposes is also quite telling. In any case, I believe that this army shouldn't be overlooked and, in case it's in good shape and fully re-equipped, it could pose a credible threat and be an enabler of Russian offensive operations during the winter. The only negative note for the Russians is that this army, hosting two of the three Russian tank divisions, has a very high number of tanks within it compared to IFVs, making it unbalanced for potential large-scale offensive operations as a stand-alone formation. Armored columns' advances without dismounts were fatal early in the war, particularly to the formations of the 1st GTA and of the Central Military District. \n\nIn the last days the Russians (probably elements of the 11th Corps) have advanced a few hundred meters near Krokhmalne, passing the Svatove-Kupyansk railway and capturing a couple of tree lines immediately to the west. I see no immediate operational consequences to this.\n\nThe 27th Motorized Brigade, the last formation of the 1st GTA, has been attacking Novoselivske for months. It has lately been joined by the 7th Motorized Regiment of the 11th Corps. By early August the Russians had been successful in taking the vast majority of the settlement. After that it seems that the bulk of the Ukrainian 25th Airborne Brigade was moved to the area. The lines have been absolutely stable ever since. The 103rd TDF Brigade is also active and there should be elements of the 92nd Assault Brigade (formerly Mechanized) in the area, which is being reformed and probably the bulk of the brigade is in the rear - except one battalion in Bakhmut. Just to the south, near Stelmakhivka, the 21st Mech Brigade should be deployed, as Strv 122s (Leopard 2A5) have been geolocated in the area. This brigade has been moving a lot: in July it was in the Kreminna sector and in August in Kupyansk.\n\nGoing further south, the hottest area from July to early last month was the one between Raihorodka and Karmazynivka. In July the Russians attacked employing elements of the 4th Tank Division together with the brigades of the 2nd Army of the Central Military District. In the second half of July they succeeded in breaking through the first Ukrainian line held by the 66th Mech Brigade by advancing 4/5 kms and reaching Novojehorivka; a few days later there was a second minor breakthrough at Serhiivka, just to the north, against the lines held by the new 32nd Mech Brigade. These breakthroughs were very dangerous as the Russians were able to cross the Zherebets (which however, let's recall, is basically a stream near Svatove) and a success in the direction of Borova could have jeopardized Ukrainian positions east of the Oskil. The Russian advance was halted and part of the lost territory was recaptured, but the Ukrainians had to employ numerous reserves: the 68th Jager Brigade (which was transferred from the Velyka Novosilka sector in the south), the new 43rd Mech Brigade, likely the Bureviy Brigade (Offensive Guard) and a battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade. In late August, the 3rd Motorized Division (20th Army, WMD) became active. It's supposed to have provided, through its 237th Tank Regiment, armored support to the 15th and 21st Motorized Brigades (2nd Army, CMD) during the attacks at the end of August and in the first half of last month in the area. It lost really a lot of tanks in the actions around Novojehorivka, including T-90Ms. We can say that after July any Russian attack in this area turned out to be a failure.

            "body": "Lately the 3rd Division has been attacking a little further south, namely toward Makiivka. It has had some success, advancing 1,5 km during the past week. A similar advance would have been reported slightly further south towards Nesvke, which in this case should be the work of elements of the new 25th Army, specifically, probably, of the 36th Motorized Regiment of the 67th Motorized Division. In this area the Russians have a topographical advantage as they control the heights (where the watershed between the Zherebets and the Krasna is located) and they attack towards the Zherebets valley. The Russians may had found a new weak point along the line but now it seems that the advance has been contained. In any case it doesn't worry me much, we are still talking about clashes taking place in the eastern bank of the Zherebets. The famous video of the T-90M being hit by an ATGM and exploding (as far as I have read it was the work of the 130th TDF Battalion) comes from Makiivka. The Russians lost quite a lot of gear there too. The area is manned also by the 66th Mech (moved a bit further south than in July), the 1st Special Purpose Brigade; a video came out yesterday in which the drone unit of the 57th Motorized Brigade was active in Makiivka. I don't know for what reason it was there; it could be a prelude to a deployment of elements of the brigade or not. The 57th Brigade is fighting in the northern flank of Bakhmut but another part of the brigade is in training, such as the 34th Battalion that received Rosomaks. Rybar reported movements of the new 44th Mech Brigade in the rear of the sector. I cannot confirm this. This brigade is equipped with Leopard 1A5s and Rosomaks and is among the new brigades that haven't yet been deployed. \n\nSo, we arrived in the Kreminna sector. This sector has been very disrupted lately due to the transfer of the entire 76th VDV Division to the Orikhiv sector. It can be divided into two areas: Torske/Yampolivka/Terny and Dibrova / Serebrianka Forest. In the former, the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army, WMD) is active and has been reinforced by a formation of the new 25th Army: the 164th Motorized Brigade. This new army is probably part of the Central MD and has been downsized compared to the initial plans, which wanted the army to field 30k men and be associated with the Eastern MD. It should have 17k men in total; the other regiments of the 67th Division and a tank brigade are yet to be deployed. They are facing the 63rd Mech Brigade, elements of the 95th Air Assault Brigade and of the TDF. Elements of the new 42nd Mech Brigade should also be deployed in this area. As far as I had read, they hadn't a good start and in August they lost several positions (presumably around Torske) and had to be bailed out by units of the 95th Brigade. Hopefully, any internal problems of the brigade has been resolved, considering that it seems confirmed that this brigade received Strykers. In any case, nothing too bad came out of that for the Ukrainians.\n\nThe 90th Tank Division (41st Army, CMD) supported by some BARS detachments, is active in the Serebrianka Forest. The unit experiencing the greatest actions there is its 228th Motorized Regiment, which is fighting against the Azov Brigade (Offensive Guard), suffering casualties and prisoners. Russian actions in the forest are paying the price of the transfer of the VDV to other sectors. The Ukrainians achieved some positional gains in the forest. The last VDV elements deployed there might be a few companies of the 331st VDV Regiment (98th Division), but I am no longer sure about that anymore - the vast majority of the 98th VDV Division has been transferred to the northern flank of Bakhmut for months. The Ukrainians in the area: most of the 67th Mechanized Brigade, the 100th TDF Brigade and the Azov Brigade that arrived in late August to reinforce the National Guard's grouping which made up the bulk of Ukrainian units in the Kreminna sector throughout 2023. There are in fact numerous National Guard units deployed in the forest.\n\nLet's recall that the National Guard (which is continuing to expand), is divided into two classes: on the one hand, the Offensive Guard brigades (i.e., the former operational brigades), which can be compared with those of the regular army; on the other hand, the brigades for the protection of public order, which are pretty much comparable with the TDF brigades. Personally, I think the Kreminna sector for the Ukrainians was the bloodiest after Bakhmut in the first half of 2023; and, also owing to the fact that much of the fighting saw VDV in action against NG units, I think the Ukrainians had worse casualties than the Russians in that specific sector. Now the situation is quieter - Kreminna has actually become the quietest sector for the Ukrainians in the north-eastern front. I don't see any structural risk in the area.\n\nIt seems that the Russians want to use most of formations of the Central Military District to reinforce the hot sectors along the frontline in Ukraine. Mashovets wrote that the 21st Motorized Brigade (2nd Army, CMD), which had been heavily involved in the attacks near Novojehorivka, would have been moved near Avdiivka and would be ready to carry attacks, although so far it has not been involved at all. I will also talk about Avdiivka and which units were involved in the Russian attacks. The 30th Motorized Brigade (2nd Army) would have been moved to the rear (it was in the Svatove sector). Mashovets initially thought it would be destined for reinforcing the Russian grouping in Kupyansk, but it has headed into the interior of Donetsk Oblast instead of Luhansk Oblast. This could be a hint that it may be destined for a sector located further south. When mentioning the locations of Russian formations, Mashovets (who has contacts with Ukrainian military intelligence) is the most reliable person I am aware of and often anticipates geolocations. \n\nRecently some Russian milbloggers reportedly wrote that two of the three brigades of the 41st Army (CMD) would have arrived in Kherson: the 55th Mountain Brigade and the 74th Motorized Brigade. They were employed in the Kreminna sector until last month. The 35th Motorized Brigade, on the other hand, seems to have been inactive through 2023. Budanov's words about the potential transfer of the 41st Army (or at least a part of it) to southern Ukraine could thus find confirmation.",

I don&#39;t know for what reason it was there; it could be a prelude to a deployment of elements of the brigade or not. The 57th Brigade is fighting in the northern flank of Bakhmut but another part of the brigade is in training, such as the 34th Battalion that received Rosomaks. Rybar reported movements of the new 44th Mech Brigade in the rear of the sector. I cannot confirm this. This brigade is equipped with Leopard 1A5s and Rosomaks and is among the new brigades that haven&#39;t yet been deployed. </p>\n\n<p>So, we arrived in the Kreminna sector. This sector has been very disrupted lately due to the transfer of the entire 76th VDV Division to the Orikhiv sector. It can be divided into two areas: Torske/Yampolivka/Terny and Dibrova / Serebrianka Forest. In the former, the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army, WMD) is active and has been reinforced by a formation of the new 25th Army: the 164th Motorized Brigade. This new army is probably part of the Central MD and has been downsized compared to the initial plans, which wanted the army to field 30k men and be associated with the Eastern MD. It should have 17k men in total; the other regiments of the 67th Division and a tank brigade are yet to be deployed. They are facing the 63rd Mech Brigade, elements of the 95th Air Assault Brigade and of the TDF. Elements of the new 42nd Mech Brigade should also be deployed in this area. As far as I had read, they hadn&#39;t a good start and in August they lost several positions (presumably around Torske) and had to be bailed out by units of the 95th Brigade. Hopefully, any internal problems of the brigade has been resolved, considering that it seems confirmed that this brigade received Strykers. In any case, nothing too bad came out of that for the Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<p>The 90th Tank Division (41st Army, CMD) supported by some BARS detachments, is active in the Serebrianka Forest. The unit experiencing the greatest actions there is its 228th Motorized Regiment, which is fighting against the Azov Brigade (Offensive Guard), suffering casualties and prisoners. Russian actions in the forest are paying the price of the transfer of the VDV to other sectors. The Ukrainians achieved some positional gains in the forest. The last VDV elements deployed there might be a few companies of the 331st VDV Regiment (98th Division), but I am no longer sure about that anymore - the vast majority of the 98th VDV Division has been transferred to the northern flank of Bakhmut for months. The Ukrainians in the area: most of the 67th Mechanized Brigade, the 100th TDF Brigade and the Azov Brigade that arrived in late August to reinforce the National Guard&#39;s grouping which made up the bulk of Ukrainian units in the Kreminna sector throughout 2023. There are in fact numerous National Guard units deployed in the forest.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s recall that the National Guard (which is continuing to expand), is divided into two classes: on the one hand, the Offensive Guard brigades (i.e., the former operational brigades), which can be compared with those of the regular army; on the other hand, the brigades for the protection of public order, which are pretty much comparable with the TDF brigades. Personally, I think the Kreminna sector for the Ukrainians was the bloodiest after Bakhmut in the first half of 2023; and, also owing to the fact that much of the fighting saw VDV in action against NG units, I think the Ukrainians had worse casualties than the Russians in that specific sector. Now the situation is quieter - Kreminna has actually become the quietest sector for the Ukrainians in the north-eastern front. I don&#39;t see any structural risk in the area.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the Russians want to use most of formations of the Central Military District to reinforce the hot sectors along the frontline in Ukraine. Mashovets wrote that the 21st Motorized Brigade (2nd Army, CMD), which had been heavily involved in the attacks near Novojehorivka, would have been moved near Avdiivka and would be ready to carry attacks, although so far it has not been involved at all. I will also talk about Avdiivka and which units were involved in the Russian attacks. The 30th Motorized Brigade (2nd Army) would have been moved to the rear (it was in the Svatove sector). Mashovets initially thought it would be destined for reinforcing the Russian grouping in Kupyansk, but it has headed into the interior of Donetsk Oblast instead of Luhansk Oblast. This could be a hint that it may be destined for a sector located further south. When mentioning the locations of Russian formations, Mashovets (who has contacts with Ukrainian military intelligence) is the most reliable person I am aware of and often anticipates geolocations. </p>\n\n<p>Recently some Russian milbloggers reportedly wrote that two of the three brigades of the 41st Army (CMD) would have arrived in Kherson: the 55th Mountain Brigade and the 74th Motorized Brigade. They were employed in the Kreminna sector until last month. The 35th Motorized Brigade, on the other hand, seems to have been inactive through 2023. Budanov&#39;s words about the potential transfer of the 41st Army (or at least a part of it) to southern Ukraine could thus find confirmation.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "With the Israeli-Hamas conflict dominating the thread, I just wanted to share a few posts I've seen about the Russian offensive in Avdiivka. \n\nYesterday, [Rob Lee shared his perspective on the Russian offensive.](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1712580928994754618?t=0349NRNwCut3862kAcos-w&s=19)\n>Some observations:\n>1) I don't think this is a diversion or fixing action\n>2) I think Russia also wants to make gains before the mud season\n>3) This seems to be a multi-battalion operation. This indicates Russia thinks it has enough forces to prevent a further Ukrainian breakthrough \n\n[Tatarigami also posted yesterday about Russian losses as part of the attack](https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1712634354147479851?t=Hbw3CQLstLdwZme8Npz1WA&s=19), he thinks Russia has lost at least 45 and as many as 58 vehicles based on an analysis of satellite imagery and the videos he had viewed prior to his post (which is already nearly 20 hours old). \n\nToday, Estonian blogger Dmitri (@wartranslated) posted translated Telegram posts from several pro-Russian bloggers about the debacle in Avdiivka. [Murz, a LDPR veteran, posted about his pessimism regarding the offensive](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1712800441245835677?t=ySM7cfqO2gCwM1KshQcM0g&s=19) in which he criticized Russian leadership for allowing the Ukrainians to fortify the area so strongly after 2014 and argued that 152mm rounds are insufficient to destroy Ukrainian defensive works in the area (made with concrete) even with direct hits, which are rare considering the inaccuracy of the guns due to extreme barrel wear. He's also worried that with the attack bogged down, the Russians will go back to beating their heads against Ukrainian defenses with huge losses and little gains. For added fun, his post also includes some racist remarks about Georgians who he refers to as \"wild aborigines with AKs.\" \n\n[Another Telegram post](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1712830457383956989?t=G-Y3gpWMaQAvRFACViaHMg&s=19) claimed that the Northern pincer achieved success and took the waste heap (its unclear if the Russians ever did take it, though they definitely don't hold it now) but the Southern pincer fell flat on its face from the get go. This post claims that the Ukrainians reacted quickly and forcefully to the threat posed by the attack by sending reinforcements and using heavy artillery to break up the attacks, including HIMARS, and that powerful Ukrainian counterattacks are expected. The author suggests that Russian soldiers have \"gotten used to the trenches\" and aren't yet attacking \"confidently\" and that this attack was a \"test of strength\" to see if the Russian forces were ready for a serious offensive, which they apparently are not. \n\n[Finally, Yuriy Yevich, a friend of Girkin's,](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1712833980435681410?t=x41C3gHxcUxZc00WSZtw1w&s=19) appealed to his readers with medical skills to come to Horlivka/Donetsk as there's a \"catastrophic shortage of surgeons\" and medics to treat the wounded there. \n\nAll of these track with what we've been able to tell about the Russian attack around Avdiivka so far, namely that it involved huge armored thrusts on two fronts with the goal of encircling the Ukrainian defenders, and quickly bogged down leading to massive losses in men and materiel.\n\nEdit: also meant to add that the [Ukrainians knocked out a key bridge supplying Russian troops on the Avdiivka front yesterday](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1712390377666187605?t=iVeTVX8leRZgixsGtufesw&s=19) (rumors are it was knocked out with a JDAM), and that [there were likely Russian forces crossing the bridge when it was hit,](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1712858158421475592?t=FKFJkY5b7uJKS7Mk0xWwsQ&s=19) with at least 1 \"Akhmat\" armored vehicle, [2 MT-LBs, 1 tank (possibly a T-80), and a MT-12 Rapira AT gun](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1712904641300644099?t=xfLbz1pdWKw4iIIHseFXIg&s=19) destroyed.",

These seem more like one-off shipments, maybe newer stuff that was cherry picked.\n\nWe will see if these train trips become more regular in the future or not but the fact that NK/Russia had to move this particular cargo the way they did this time around in no way indicates it's an one time deal.  It just shows the lack of transport infrastructure on their part mainly b/c NK doesn't trade much with anyone except PRC.\n\nThey needed to move 300 shipping containers full of ammunitions from NK to maybe Rostov on Don.  How do you do that?  Well, if this was a normal trade during normal times between non-sanctioned countries - let's say South Korea shipping 300 containers full of washing machines to Rostov on Don in 2013 - you would charter 300 slots on a giant container ship that has 20000 TEU capacity from Busan to Rotterdam/Antwerp/Hamburg and then charter another smaller feeder container ship to take them from Rotterdam/Antwerp/Hamburg to Rostov on Don.  But NK/Russia can't do that now because for one, they can't really access global shipping firms like Maersk or CMA CGM nor do they have their own flagged containerships capable of sailing from NK to Russia.  And even if they did have say Russian or North Korean flagged containership, they would be worried about being interdicted by US and others since trading of arms with North Korea is a violation of multiple UN sanctions all of which Russia had signed off on prior.  So that makes trans siberian railway as the only option for this trade.  But because NK doesn't do much trade and definitely don't send/receive much if any intermodal containers via trains, NK didn't have any train cars capable of transporting 300 containers.  So then it makes logical sense for NK to ship them via a ship to a Russian far east port so that the ship never leave NK or Russian territorial waters and then Russia to load them into train(s) to move them to westward.",

I know it's what people expected from them from an ideological standpoint but this is not quite in line with its Foreign Ministry's recent stance.\n\nRussia's whole foreign relations shtick for the last year or so has been that \"the collective West\" has tried to impose a so-called \"rules-based order\", which is in fact a thinly-veiled instrument of Washington's unipolar domination, over a multipolar world that already had an order based on rules and enforced by the UN. I stayed awake through several of Lavrov's speeches so you don't have to, here's [one](https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1869816/) where he articulates this position briefly enough that you can read through it without going through more than one cup of espresso.\n\nNevermind that it's self-serving and bollocks, the part that I find strange is that Russia is now willing to table an essentially unactionable UNSC draft without any consultation with potential major partners, in a closed-doors session, at a time when its isolation in international forums, including the UN, is a major diplomatic vulnerability for it.\n\nWorse, with a text that has zero chance of passing -- condemning all acts of terrorism and calling for a release of all hostages sounds like a legit objective, but without naming the organisation holding them hostage that's akin to tabling a draft that condemns all acts of war and calls for an immediate cessation of all kiling, the kind of thing you expect from third graders writing letters to world leaders, not international diplomats at a serious forum. And which opens them to direct, legitimate and very obvious criticism from Israel, given that they weren't exactly quick to call for a \"humanitarian ceasefire\" when it was just Hamas doing the firing at Israeli civilians -- in fact they haven't called on Hamas to do anything yet.\n\nIt's a bill that re-enforces Russia's isolation at the UN, illustrates why the international community developed (mostly under the UN's umbrella, which Lavrov conveniently omits) additional conventions and processes beyond \"let's discuss it in the UN\" in the first place, and wastes the UN's limited media space and relevance, all at the same time. It weakens both the status of the limited subset of international norms that Russia claims to recognize *and* Russia's position within it.\n\nIf this was anything other than a probing move to see which way the US and China swing in the UNSC which got misreported as a possibly serious deal, it's such an amateurish move that I can't help but wonder if the Foreign Ministry actually had a say in it. Lavrov and his staff lie with a straight face but if they get to do their homework, their work is top notch, or in any case, as good as you can make it when working off of decisions like Putin's.

In the days of written messages and witness testimonials, the problem of sorting out what was trustworthy and what was not still existed.  Anyone can fabricate false reports or false testimonials.  \n\nThe method used to get accurate intel was to develop trustworthy intel network - you vet the sources and the delivery.  You send agents who you trust, and then you can trust information they bring back.

Basically, if you want to enter something into evidence in a court proceeding you need to provide additional evidence that what you are submitting is genuine. Authentication is often provided by a witness testifying about the thing being entered into evidence, but there are a number of ways besides witness testimony to authenticate evidence.\n\nRegarding your specific question about the murder victim's phone photos - no, it definitely isn't automatically inadmissible just because she's dead. As far as authentication goes you could just get someone from the cellphone company to testify that everything pulled off the phone belonged to the victim.

The government-in-name-only exercised no real control over the territory.\n\nThe commonly cited *casus belli* preceding Russia's intervention in September 1999 was the infamous 1999 Russian apartment bombings, which are shrouded in controversy due to the alleged FSB conspiracy. However, Caucasian Jihadi groups had been attacking Russia for a while and had launched an offensive into Dagestan. The chaotic state of Russia at the time which allowed for illicit firearms and contraband to flourish meant that Islamist groups were more than capable of bombing urban centers in Russia. Regardless, by the time the Russians stormed Chechnya, the supposed Chechen government's pleas were ignored by Moscow because it was so impotent and irrelevant. It'd be like if the Brazilians and Mexicans decided on a mass military intervention in Haiti and Ariel Henry's pleas to Washington were ignored, of course because he's only a figurehead and nothing more.\n\nCompare Chechnya back in the day to today. Yeah, it's nothing special by Western standards, but the fact that it was rebuilt so quickly and normalized is incredible. The situation for the average Chechen improved so much that there's no point in rebelling against Russia when the alternative was so much worse. Chechnya and Russia had fairly close ties so integrating the region back was fairly easy.\n\nI don't know if Israel can really do the same with Gaza. Maybe some kind of Chechnya-like miracle happens where the region rebuilds fast and the locals are content enough that a Hamas-like movement can't grow strongly again. Israel would have to put in a lot of money/work and show that they're better rulers and have some puppet do the warlording like Kadyrov. Maybe the Americans, Europeans, Saudis and Emiratis pour in money too. It'd also have to be completely closed off to Jewish settlements (it already is, but this would have to be maintained no matter what to make it work).",

Unless you're a high-level member of the Israeli government, you have no idea about their successes and can only look at their failures. Of course with a sample size of 1 failure you're going to conclude that they are failures.\n\nAmerica got warnings about the 9/11 attacks, and the terrorists involved went to pilot school in Southern California. Does that mean the US intelligence complex is now incompetent forever in all areas?

This was one of the main units responsible for the offensive in the Vasylivka direction in June which quickly petered out. As near as I can tell from trawling for Twitter videos, they entered the Tokmak advance a few weeks ago in mid-late September and are now performing the assault towards Kopani. This comes after a reconstitution that took place over a few months of relatively little action, so I'm inclined to think they're pretty fresh.\n\nUkraine's objective is to protect its westward flank. This could be in pursuit of more bite-and-hold slow advancement, or as a way to slow down offensive operations and pivot towards defense. They're going to have to make some decisions about their ammo usage, assuming they're using significantly more ammo than they would in a defensive posture.\n\nWhich brings up an interesting thing from the latest Perpetua stream. I generally take Perpetua's analyses with a huge grain of salt seeing as how he's just a really really obsessive baseball nerd. But his guests can be really informative, especially those who have extensive military experience. During the initial couple months of the offensive, he had a combat engineer on who gave absolutely golden information on how breaching is conducted from a combat engineer perspective. If you're ever interested in learning how sappers see war, look up those old videos.)\n\nAnyway. CJ, an American artilleryman, was talking about how defensive operations often end up requiring *more* shells, *more* guns, *more* stress on fires logistics because you're no longer concentrating on one axis of advance. You now have to defend against all possible axes of advance, often have to shoot at highly mobile targets, and often underestimate or overestimate your ammo needs in one theater compared to another. In contrast, offensive operations involve shooting at targets that are more often static, or at least whose movements are much more predictable. If so, perhaps winding down the offensive isn't in Ukraine's best interest for ammo conservation; but reducing OPTEMPO a bit would let them preserve their forces.\n\nMaybe Duncan or another military guy can corroborate his view.",

During the initial couple months of the offensive, he had a combat engineer on who gave absolutely golden information on how breaching is conducted from a combat engineer perspective. If you&#39;re ever interested in learning how sappers see war, look up those old videos.)</p>\n\n<p>Anyway. CJ, an American artilleryman, was talking about how defensive operations often end up requiring <em>more</em> shells, <em>more</em> guns, <em>more</em> stress on fires logistics because you&#39;re no longer concentrating on one axis of advance. You now have to defend against all possible axes of advance, often have to shoot at highly mobile targets, and often underestimate or overestimate your ammo needs in one theater compared to another. In contrast, offensive operations involve shooting at targets that are more often static, or at least whose movements are much more predictable. If so, perhaps winding down the offensive isn&#39;t in Ukraine&#39;s best interest for ammo conservation; but reducing OPTEMPO a bit would let them preserve their forces.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Duncan or another military guy can corroborate his view.</p>\n</div>",

And with time stamps for the exact conversation? \n\n>You now have to defend against all possible axes of advance, often have to shoot at highly mobile targets, and often underestimate or overestimate your ammo needs in one theater compared to another.\n\nThis is true, this is why it's advantageous to be on the offensive because they have the initiative, they control when and where the fighting happens, and they can mass properly to achieve favorable force ratios. \n\nDefenders can mass too, we see that happen regularly in this war where one sector gets more troops than others, with some being extremely stretched out (like Kharkiv last September) while others have massive force densities (like the Orikhiv axis now). But like Kharkiv showed, it's dangerous to do that, if intelligence is wrong (like German defensive planning before OP Bagration in WW2), or if the enemy is adoptive and flexible able to move forces to exploit a quickly identified weakness (again, Kharkiv last September), it can backfire, horrifically. Because one can't be strong everyone, if they choose where to be strong it can backfire, but if they spread out their force they're weak everywhere.\n\nThat said, the defender typically only NEEDS to fire artillery to stop an attack, as in directed fires at specific targets that are positively identified and in the open during some part of the attack, hopefully trying to breach an obstacle to fix them in place or delay movement. \n\nAdditionally they can do counterbattery, striking assembly areas, firing as part of a spoiling attack, Harassment and Interdiction Fires, etc, but they don't have to. The attacker does, especially counterbattery. \n\nHowever, the defender doesn't need to perform prep fires to \"soften up\" a defensive position or destroy them before an attack (which both Russia and Ukraine tend to favor). Nor does the defender need to perform lengthy suppressive fires either. And those consume LOTS of artillery ammo. \n\nThis is why the Ukrainians were able to defend properly in this war, for the most part, despite the Russians having a much higher fire rate at a ratio of 1:3-5, (some say more at times), supposedly up to 1:10 ratios in the actual sectors being attacked. It wasn't because the Ukrainians are just awesome at artillery, it was because they didn't need to fire as much to accomplish their mission. \n\n>often have to shoot at highly mobile targets\n\nMobile yes. But also are out of cover, often clustered together too. That's a big deal. \n\nMore so, when they are shot at, they've already been observed by somebody acting as a forward observer, either on the ground or using an ISTAR drone, which means not only can they effectively adjust fires but also do immediate battle damage assessment to see the immediate highly damaging effects against vehicles or dismounts in the open, in a way that is just guesswork most of the time when hitting static defensive positions.\n\n1). You have an enemy infantry platoon in the open advancing on your position. As an observer, how do you know if your arty is effective against them? If 1-2 rounds lands even near them, they're screwed. You'll spot them taking casualties, you'll see them taking cover, if they're trying to move to get out of fire, if they are retreating, and able to adjust fires the whole time to be more effective and damaging.\n\n2). You have an enemy infantry platoon in an extended trench system, with dug outs, overhead cover, etc. As an observer, how do you know if your arty is effective against them? You hit them for hours or even days with continuous fires, delayed fuze, until you just can't believe they're still combat effective. Meanwhile, you argue with your chain of command because a logistics bean counter is pressuring your supporting batteries to declare those positions destroyed so they can save ammo and work over other targets. But you don't really know can only guess. So the ground unit you support launches an attack against them, effectively doing reconnaissance in force, verifying enemy strength by attacking, aka a probing attack, to test whether supporting destructive fires were effective. If the attack can take the position with ease, yep, fires were effective. If they take heavy losses or are repulsed, fires didn't work, back to the drawing board. \n\nWhich version sounds like it consumes more tubes and ammo?",

But Professor Jeroen Gunning, who knows the movement well, does see a logic. \"Hamas is concerned with the long term.\"\n\n*by Melvyn Ingleby October 12, 2023 at 16:50*\n\nBlind killing intent seems at first glance to be the only explanation for Hamas' massacre of Israeli civilians on Saturday. Why else mow down elderly people and children? What did Hamas hope to achieve with this? Did it not see that Israel would respond with a mass bombardment of Gaza? Or does it not care at all about civilian lives, even those of Palestinians?\n\nThose who know Hamas well, however, do see clear motivations and long-term goals behind the offensive. \"These are certainly not limited to just sowing terror,\" says Professor Jeroen Gunning of King's College London, who has been researching Hamas for nearly three decades. \"The violence is terrible and inexcusable, but if you reduce Hamas to a gang of irrational terrorists, you will never understand why this is happening.\"\n\nTo understand the violence - \"and understanding is not the same as justifying it,\" Gunning stresses - he says you have to go back to the context behind it. In doing so, he points not only to the hopeless situation in Gaza and the ever-increasing Israeli colonization of the West Bank, but also to the internal debate within Hamas on how to respond. In this, moderates and radicals have traditionally been diametrically opposed, Gunning said. \"That the radicals now have the upper hand is largely the result of Israel's repression and failure to find a political solution.\"\n\n*Why did Hamas begin this offensive?*\"\n\nIn Hamas' eyes, it was now or never. It was in dire straits in numerous ways. Israel has the most right-wing government in its history, openly talks about annexing most of Palestinian territory and, even before this escalation this year, killed 230 Palestinians in the West Bank. Internationally, Israel is increasingly getting a free hand in this, and even Saudi Arabia, once an outspoken advocate of the Palestinian cause, was recently normalizing ties with Israel, as were six Arab states that had done so before. Finally, within Gaza itself, Hamas was being challenged by more radical groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which recently seemed to have the upper hand in armed resistance to Israel. So Hamas' reasoning seems to be: we must do something before the Palestinian cause is forgotten.\"\n\n*And the civilian population in Gaza just has to bear it?*\"\n\nThat's the terrible thing. Civilians don't want to become 'martyrs,' they want a normal life. But the problem is precisely that that doesn't exist in Gaza. The population has been living de facto in an open-air prison since the 2007 blockade. Poverty is enormous, there is no perspective and the dreamed Palestinian state is further away than ever. All this increases the acceptance of violence. No one wants to be bombed, but part of the population is willing to bear the consequences of Hamas' offensive in the hope that something will change. A poll from September this year shows that 45 percent of them would support Hamas in elections versus only 28 percent support for Fatah \\[the secular and internationally recognized branch of the Palestinian movement\\]. How things stand now is unknown, but in the past support for Hamas actually increased after confrontations with Israel.\"\n\n*Why does Hamas commit atrocities against Israeli civilians?*\"\n\nOn the one hand, atrocity is part of Hamas' strategy. The horrific images of elderly or children killed and the fact that twelve hundred Israelis were killed in one weekend are meant to create panic and undermine confidence in the Israeli government. On the other hand, it is also a form of revenge, because Israel kills civilians just as much. Between 2008 and last month, according to UN figures, there were 21 times more Palestinian civilian deaths than Israeli ones.\"\n\n*Isn't Hamas' brutality simply part of its nature as a terror group?*\"\n\nHamas does not have a fixed 'nature.' Hamas is not immutable or monolithic. It is a group that has often changed course, has different branches and is very divided between radicals and pragmatists. Which side gets the upper hand depends on the \"opportunity structure\" in which Hamas operates. When radicals get more opportunities, for example due to increasing Israeli violence and lack of political solutions, you get a more radical Hamas. But when pragmatists get opportunities, as when Hamas participated in Palestinian elections in 2006, the radicals get more sidelined.\"\n\n*How did this internal dynamic play out in recent years?*\n\n\"After the 2014 Gaza war, Hamas entered a period of relative calm during which the pragmatists tried to break Hamas' isolation. Despite previous failures, they sought rapprochement with Fatah, and in 2017 they published a new manifesto. Although many media outlets continue to quote from the old 1988 charter, which is extremely anti-Semitic and contains phrases such as \"Islam will crush Israel,\" the new manifesto makes a clear distinction between the Zionist project and the Jewish people and advocates religious tolerance. Moreover, it accepts a return to the 1967 borders, implying a two-state solution, although Hamas refuses to recognize Israel.\n\n\"But these changes of course did nothing for the pragmatists. Negotiations with Fatah failed, Hamas remained internationally reviled, Gaza's blockade held, and Israel, on the contrary, took more and more Palestinian land, encouraged by the administration of U.S. President Trump. As a result, the pragmatists in Gaza came under fire from the more radical members of Hamas and from other militant groups, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It may sound strange to our ears, but the latter actually accused Hamas of becoming part of 'the system' that sustained Israel.\"\n\n*Is this offensive the work of the radicals?*\"\n\nI think so. The attack was prepared and carried out by the Qassam Brigades, who are traditionally more radical and at odds with the political wing. Because Israeli intelligence agencies have many informants in Gaza, the decision-making will have remained with a very small circle. There are media reports that Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader who lives in Qatar, did not know about it for a long time.\"\n\n*How will it proceed?*\"\n\nThat depends in part on the role of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah. The report in The Wall Street Journal that Iran helped prepare the Hamas offensive has so far been denied by both the U.S. and Israel, but if evidence of it does surface, it could lead to a major escalation. So far, that has not been the case. Israel and Hezbollah have been firing rockets back and forth, but Hezbollah seems cautious because Lebanon is already on the precipice and there is little appetite for war.\n\n\"In addition, the question is how far Israel will go in Gaza. Israel has already said it is waging war against 'human beasts,' is now cutting off all of Gaza from power, water and food, and is carrying out massive bombings. But how long the 300,000 reservists Israel has called up will be deployed for a ground offensive remains to be seen. Such an offensive could cost many Israeli lives because Hamas has tunnels and mines all over the place and knows the terrain better. Hamas is probably gambling that Israel will eventually get bogged down and that international pressure to negotiate will increase as the civilian death toll rises, just as it did in the 2014 Gaza war.\"\n\n(continued)",

However this board is clearly very Western in its userbase (as one would expect), and also broadly stands in line with modern Western academic understandings of international relations.

As a system, it can be mounted to many different types of vehicles. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond the AUSA stuff:</p>\n\n<p>EOS also produces the Slinger, which <a href=\"https://eos-aus.com/eos-confirms-first-slinger-exports-to-ukraine/\">the US bought them for the gun trucks, and EOS did a 2 week demonstration at Redstone Arsenal attached to an M113</a>, which convinced them to buy 160 of the systems for their M113s and another vehicle. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/270134\">The US Army has received their first 4 DE M-SHORAD</a>. They were delivered along with the kinetic M-SHORAD systems for training in June 2023. They plan to employ them in a Soldier Touchpoint this year. It also has <a href=\"https://www.leonardodrs.com/news/press-releases/contract-award-for-us-army-m-lids-counter-uas-platforms/\">M-LIDS</a>, larger non-kinetic systems being <a href=\"https://www.military.com/equipment/weapons/beam-wide-range-counter-drone-technologies-comes-age.html\">tested and put into production</a>, as well as smaller handheld systems <a href=\"https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/dronebuster-handheld-counter-unmanned-aerial-system-c-uas-usa/\">like Drone Buster</a> also are in use.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also the <a href=\"https://www.janes.com/amp/idet-2023-excalibur-army-viktor-light-air-defence-vehicles-supplied-to-ukraine/ZnlJK3dHVU9mZ28xajRJVkc5dVI5VFp1cVMwPQ2\">Viktor AA system</a>, though it&#39;s manual. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.l3harris.com/all-capabilities/vampire\">Vampire anti-drone system</a> can also be mounted on many different vehicles, and is laser guided small rockets.  </p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s before even getting into EW.</p>\n</div>",

Apparently the Geneva Protocol [probably doesn\u2019t ban riot agents](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/banning_poison_gas_and_germ_warfare_should_the_united_states_agree), only chemical agents that cause death or serious harm (that was the Western position prior to the CWC anyway).\n\nHowever, I think you\u2019re mistaken on the Geneva Conventions. Here\u2019s the ICRC\u2019s writeup*:\n\n>Under Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, non-international armed conflicts are armed conflicts in which one or more non-State armed groups are involved. Depending on the situation, hostilities may occur between governmental armed forces and non-State armed groups or between such groups only. As the four Geneva Conventions have universally been ratified now, the requirement that the armed conflict must occur \"in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties\" has lost its importance in practice. Indeed, any armed conflict between governmental armed forces and armed groups or between such groups cannot but take place on the territory of one of the Parties to the Convention.\n\nSo under Israel\u2019s interpretation that the Gaza Strip is stateless, it wouldn\u2019t apply for two reasons right now: Gaza is not the territory of a party (although it would be if Israel occupied it) and Hamas is a non-state actor. They also apply to parties to a conflict who are not parties** to the Conventions if they nevertheless agree to abide by them, but of course Hamas doesn\u2019t actually abide by them (which would mean they lose protection regardless).\n\n^(* Keep in mind that the ICRC is quite biased, both against Israel and in favor of arms control.)\n^(** To be clear, the \u201cState of Palestine\u201d is allegedly a party because Switzerland reversed its prior position of not recognizing its accession prior to an international consensus on statehood a few years ago.

Apparently the Geneva Protocol <a href=\"https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/banning_poison_gas_and_germ_warfare_should_the_united_states_agree\">probably doesn\u2019t ban riot agents</a>, only chemical agents that cause death or serious harm (that was the Western position prior to the CWC anyway).</p>\n\n<p>However, I think you\u2019re mistaken on the Geneva Conventions. Here\u2019s the ICRC\u2019s writeup*:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Under Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, non-international armed conflicts are armed conflicts in which one or more non-State armed groups are involved. Depending on the situation, hostilities may occur between governmental armed forces and non-State armed groups or between such groups only. As the four Geneva Conventions have universally been ratified now, the requirement that the armed conflict must occur &quot;in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties&quot; has lost its importance in practice. Indeed, any armed conflict between governmental armed forces and armed groups or between such groups cannot but take place on the territory of one of the Parties to the Convention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So under Israel\u2019s interpretation that the Gaza Strip is stateless, it wouldn\u2019t apply for two reasons right now: Gaza is not the territory of a party (although it would be if Israel occupied it) and Hamas is a non-state actor. They also apply to parties to a conflict who are not parties** to the Conventions if they nevertheless agree to abide by them, but of course Hamas doesn\u2019t actually abide by them (which would mean they lose protection regardless).</p>\n\n<p><sup>* Keep in mind that the ICRC is quite biased, both against Israel and in favor of arms control.</sup>\n<sup>** To be clear, the \u201cState of Palestine\u201d is allegedly a party because Switzerland reversed its prior position of not recognizing its accession prior to an international consensus on statehood a few years ago. I suspect Israel and the US may treat that as ineffectual in making them an actual party, but indicative of an intent to be bound, but I have no idea what the precedent is with respect to a treaty depository recognizing a state that not all the parties to the treaty do.</sup></p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Several key questions about Israel/Palestine that are perhaps unknowable, even by decision makers, but are important.\n\n* Qualitatively, it is known that Hamas has a tunnel network. Is there any understanding of the quantitative portion? How long does it run? How much (if any) material can be moved from Egypt to Gaza? How developed is it under the city itself? How reliable is tunnel detection technology, and does Israel have that on hand? How confident are we in our understanding of any of those answers?\n\n* In 1969, politically, ethnically, culturally and religiously divided communities sharing cities after a long period of peaceful agitation, entered into a spiral of retribution that escalated into a full insurgency, which was made possible by international support and having to counterbalance combat effectiveness, blowback, a highly complex legal/political situation and international PR. It was an emergent, complex phenomenon that was not understood until well after it became unescapable. Ian Paisley did not randomly stand up, clear his throat, and say (he didn't say it, he declared it)  \"I hereby declare The Troubles \u2122\ufe0f\".
