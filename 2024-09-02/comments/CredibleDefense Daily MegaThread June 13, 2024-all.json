What's new is that this figure is now reached without private participation, but only with federal + regional + municipal money. Poorer regions and cities cannot afford to pay such sums, but one can still quite conveniently travel and sign a contract in the places where they offer more, and the trip is reimbursed, in its entirerety or in large part. \n\nIn any case since the end of last year there has been substantial stagnation in the maximum amounts reached by the signing bonuses; also in regards to salaries it seems very difficult to go beyond 210/220 thousand Rubles a month. Compensations in case of death or injury have remained the same as the last year. On the other hand, it seems that lately they are focusing more on bonuses in case of active fighting or advances (an example regarding an ad that has been running a lot lately: 8 thousand Rubles per day in case of fighting + 50 thousand Rubles for each kilometer of advance recorded during the clashes). But let's also remember that under the Decree 647 of Sept. 21, 2022, all contracts are automatically extended until the end of the SMO, barring a few exceptions. \n\nI would not pay much attention to the exchange rate, as what matters to an average Russian who has never left the country is the domestic price level (when the Ruble during summer 2022 had appreciated by 1/3 against the Dollar, compared to 2021 values, certainly the average Russian paid in Rubles was not 1/3 richer). So I would just adjust the figures to the country's cumulative inflation compared to a time basis rather than to the exchange rate.",

Compensations in case of death or injury have remained the same as the last year. On the other hand, it seems that lately they are focusing more on bonuses in case of active fighting or advances (an example regarding an ad that has been running a lot lately: 8 thousand Rubles per day in case of fighting + 50 thousand Rubles for each kilometer of advance recorded during the clashes). But let&#39;s also remember that under the Decree 647 of Sept. 21, 2022, all contracts are automatically extended until the end of the SMO, barring a few exceptions. </p>\n\n<p>I would not pay much attention to the exchange rate, as what matters to an average Russian who has never left the country is the domestic price level (when the Ruble during summer 2022 had appreciated by 1/3 against the Dollar, compared to 2021 values, certainly the average Russian paid in Rubles was not 1/3 richer). So I would just adjust the figures to the country&#39;s cumulative inflation compared to a time basis rather than to the exchange rate.</p>\n</div>",

This didn't happen at all for Ukraine.\n\nThe result was that we had no clue about the state of affairs on the Russian side, besides what little could be extrapolated by frontline developments, and even those were subjected to (justified) scrutiny, because no one had access to any sort of data or informed opinion. This then transformed into lack of engagement, and without engagement it looked like nothing bad was happening to Russia. Now we know this is false, because the \"Kharkiv offensive\" resulted in a fluke and made all the weakness of Russia apparent. But for a while, Russia was almost unstoppable according to the information space.",

You need to be able to quickly get any of this immediately from the manufacturer with little delay - not bespoke, not made to order, it needs to be right there on the assembly line getting pumped out for every other order in the yard and the next yard up the coast and so on.</p>\n\n<p>This is why US manufacturing, no matter how large it may be, is irrelevant as far as shipbuilding is concerned. America doesn\u2019t have any of it. To get to a point where any of this is even remotely what we\u2019d consider efficient shipbuilding it wouldn\u2019t just take a concerted effort into investing in yards - it would be one of the greatest undertakings in manufacturing revival ever undertaken by a state probably in recorded history.

Better leadership could squeeze more out of the industry as-is, but the industry itself needs to be expanded to meet the political goals demanded of it. There&#39;s no easy solution, of course, or else it wouldn&#39;t be the subject of so much handwringing.</p>\n</div>",
