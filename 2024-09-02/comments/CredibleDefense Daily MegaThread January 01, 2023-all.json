Armies aren't marching forward on a 100 mile front, they use roads  \n> Each road taken has been defended, the fact the land bridge has only one road doesn't really change the matter here.\n\nA road is a kind of chokepoint I guess. It's certainly a logistics chokepoint, but I don't know if it's a chokepoint when fighting. \n \nWhen the road is surrounded by terrain, infantry can dismount and fight in that terrain rather than the road. Depending on the conditions, even vehicles can get off the road and fight there, spreading out from that road. This means you can perform flanking actions and the enemy won't know exactly where you are coming from. (There are certainly conditions where a road can become a chokepoint, such as heavy mud on the sides of the road, meaning you can't get off the road.)\n \nA true chokepoint means that this is impossible.

In fact the United States and NATO are so good at it that people forget that other armed forces (in this case the Russians) are not that great at it. Hence Russia failing to this day to have air supremacy over Ukraine.\n\nA NATO vs Russia conflict would almost certainly lead to NATO air supremacy very quickly. And in such a situation, you can see NATO strategic planners not finding artillery to be as useful.\n\nIn fact, I think a lot of the current difficulties for NATO in assisting Ukraine is that Ukraine is fighting a war that NATO itself never planned for.

The cheaper MANPADS idea sounds really promising to me, for use against low end and non-maneuvering targets. Any idea if that is being worked on?  As you point out, the economics matter. Although I suppose it's not just the missile-vs-missile price, but also the price of whatever would have been destroyed if the drone hadn't been MANPADSed, so it seems worthwhile to fire a 6-figures MANPADS against a 5 figures drone if the drone was going to destroy a 7 or 8 figures transformer.",

A long range lobbing contest would benefit the side with more strategic space.</p>\n\n<p>China&#39;s biggest edge is the Chinese shore line. America&#39;s biggest edge is the island contain of China. </p>\n\n<p>If you force a stalemate, it benefits USA more than China. Keep in mind China&#39;s trade and oil is blockaded as well. </p>\n\n<p>A2D2 from the US would be very hard for China to deal with. Imagine small teams of marines on uninhabited islands with the ability to sink ships. It would be wackamole.</p>\n\n<p>I would love anti ship drones that have 1500km range.</p>\n</div>",

Suggesting the Marines don't need artillery because they exist to conduct amphibious assaults only is like saying the Army doesn't need airborne infantry because those aren't required for a combined arms breach, etc. It's a dramatic ove simplification that ignores what those military branches do.\n\nWhen it comes to amphibious landings, contested are the least preferable way to conduct them. They happen only if it's impossible to avoid, or somebody screwed up with intelligence or prep fires. The Marines have focused on the ability to do contested landing because it's the only mission that only THEY can do, the Army CAN'T, so it gives the Marines a lot of security as a branch of service not only for better funding but also just existing. The same goes for it's new China mission, that's only a small part of what it's responsible to do but it's a critical mission that the Army is utterly incapable of doing, which means as long as the Marines can do it then it automatically stops anyone in Wash DC from uttering the most horrifying sentence every Marine general is terrified of, \"Why does the Marine Corps need to exist?\" \n\nAlso, no amphibious landing force in modern history needed field artillery during the actual assault landing, and yet all contained artillery as part of their organizational structure (to include the US Army who did more landings in WW2 than the Marines did). Why? Because amphibious operations only really begin when the beach is taken, at which point the assault forces are reinforced by everything else that isn't included with the landing team, such as artillery, air defense, logistics, medical, etc. They use all that to sustain themselves in order to get off the beach and move further inland, as the objective for conducting an amphibious landing is never the strategic value of the beach, the beach is just the means to move from ship to shore. \n\nRight from the manual: **The LF normally requires fire support against shore targets before, during, and after the initial landings. Once sufficient area is seized ashore, artillery can be landed to provide additional fire support. Until ground fire support means (e.g., mortars, rockets, and cannon artillery) of the LF are landed and ready to provide support, fire support is provided by CAS, NSFS, and, in limited cases, direct and indirect fires from adjacent friendly forces.**\n\nFurther, amphibious ops don't even need to include actual landing craft to take a beach, Marines can move assault troops and artillery both from helicopters, land inland, and then fight backwards to the beach to take it and make it secure for other landing craft to unload uncontested. \n\nMarine and Army rotary wing aviation is different. The former relies near totally on more powerful helicopters than the latter, whose combat aviation brigades relies mostly on UH-60 Blackhawks, which have between 1/4-1/2 of the lift capacity the helicopters that the USMC mostly uses, which is why the Army infantry BCTs only are stuck with 105mm instead of 155. The Marines won't bring M119 artillery for the same reason they don't use Bradley's either.",
                                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There is a lot wrong with this.</p>\n\n<p>LZ means where helicopters land, landing beach is what you seem to be referring to.</p>\n\n<p>Amphibious landings are a primary mission the USMC does, far from the only mission. Suggesting the Marines don&#39;t need artillery because they exist to conduct amphibious assaults only is like saying the Army doesn&#39;t need airborne infantry because those aren&#39;t required for a combined arms breach, etc. It&#39;s a dramatic ove simplification that ignores what those military branches do.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to amphibious landings, contested are the least preferable way to conduct them. They happen only if it&#39;s impossible to avoid, or somebody screwed up with intelligence or prep fires. The Marines have focused on the ability to do contested landing because it&#39;s the only mission that only THEY can do, the Army CAN&#39;T, so it gives the Marines a lot of security as a branch of service not only for better funding but also just existing. The same goes for it&#39;s new China mission, that&#39;s only a small part of what it&#39;s responsible to do but it&#39;s a critical mission that the Army is utterly incapable of doing, which means as long as the Marines can do it then it automatically stops anyone in Wash DC from uttering the most horrifying sentence every Marine general is terrified of, &quot;Why does the Marine Corps need to exist?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Also, no amphibious landing force in modern history needed field artillery during the actual assault landing, and yet all contained artillery as part of their organizational structure (to include the US Army who did more landings in WW2 than the Marines did). Why? Because amphibious operations only really begin when the beach is taken, at which point the assault forces are reinforced by everything else that isn&#39;t included with the landing team, such as artillery, air defense, logistics, medical, etc. They use all that to sustain themselves in order to get off the beach and move further inland, as the objective for conducting an amphibious landing is never the strategic value of the beach, the beach is just the means to move from ship to shore. </p>\n\n<p>Right from the manual: <strong>The LF normally requires fire support against shore targets before, during, and after the initial landings. Once sufficient area is seized ashore, artillery can be landed to provide additional fire support. Until ground fire support means (e.g., mortars, rockets, and cannon artillery) of the LF are landed and ready to provide support, fire support is provided by CAS, NSFS, and, in limited cases, direct and indirect fires from adjacent friendly forces.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Further, amphibious ops don&#39;t even need to include actual landing craft to take a beach, Marines can move assault troops and artillery both from helicopters, land inland, and then fight backwards to the beach to take it and make it secure for other landing craft to unload uncontested. </p>\n\n<p>Marine and Army rotary wing aviation is different. The former relies near totally on more powerful helicopters than the latter, whose combat aviation brigades relies mostly on UH-60 Blackhawks, which have between 1/4-1/2 of the lift capacity the helicopters that the USMC mostly uses, which is why the Army infantry BCTs only are stuck with 105mm instead of 155. The Marines won&#39;t bring M119 artillery for the same reason they don&#39;t use Bradley&#39;s either.</p>\n</div>",
