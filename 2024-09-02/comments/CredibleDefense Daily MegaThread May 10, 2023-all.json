As always must be taken with a grain of salt, but some of his points are fairly realistic.\n\nIt is important because for the first time he's making an astonishing statement, admitting that bakhmut has no strategic value and that it was made only to keep pressure on ukrainians and try to dry them out. He's saying that since april this is not working anymore.\n\nHere's the complete (translated) statement with more info:\n\n>1. Bakhmut has no strategic importance;  \n>  \n>2. Bakhmut was needed in order to, after the failures and retreat of the RF Armed Forces from Kharkov, Kherson and other regions, build up offensive potential, grind the enemy\u2019s manpower and enable the Russian army to mobilize;  \n>  \n>3. In view of the fear of internal competition, PMC \"Wagner\" began to \"dry\" in terms of personnel, weapons and ammunition, artificially reducing combat potential;  \n>  \n>4. The effectiveness of the \u201cBakhmut meat grinder\u201d decreased in April-May 2023, the Armed Forces of Ukraine gathered for a counteroffensive;  \n>  \n>5. Due to the reduction in personnel, PMC \"Wagner\" was forced to transfer the flanks to the military;  \n>  \n>6. There is a serious risk of encirclement of PMC \"Wagner\" in Bakhmut as a result of the failure of the flanks. The flanks are already cracking and falling through;  \n>  \n>7. In the absence of ammunition, the \"meat grinder\" will work in the opposite direction: the Armed Forces of Ukraine will destroy PMC \"Wagner\";  \n>  \n>8. I demand ammunition in order to save the lives of the fighters and \u201cput the squeeze on\u201d Bakhmut, in which there are about 5% left occupied by the enemy;  \n>  \n>9. At the moment, within the city of Bakhmut, there is only Wagner PMC, there are no other units. Outside Bakhmut - only the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, PMC \"Wagner\" is not there;  \n>  \n>10. PMC \"Wagner\" planned to leave Bakhmut to save the lives of fighters and minimize senseless losses, since the remnants of ammunition were only enough until the end of the day on May 9, 2023;  \n>  \n>11. The top leadership of the country was instructed by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation to provide PMC \"Wagner\" with everything necessary;  \n>  \n>12. On the night of May 6-7, 2023, a combat order was issued promising to give Wagner PMC ammunition;  \n>  \n>13. In during the day on May 8-9, 2023, the required amount of ammunition was not issued. Until now, ammunition has been filtered to a minimum;  \n>  \n>14.

Russia&#39;s offensive potential is increasingly concentrated into just a few units (Wagner, VDV, Naval Infantry) and those have suffered horrendous casualties over the past few months. Clearly Ukraine wasn&#39;t very concerned about the prospects of this offensive considering they were able to amass at least a dozen new brigades, and rest/refit quite a few more brigades while keeping the Russians to minimal gains. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jabuttee/status/1656383091231928322?t=PndN-3dXIisbJQCbsDH1KQ&amp;s=19\">This map really does put the &quot;successes&quot; of this offensive into perspective.</a></p>\n</div>",

At the same time, in terms of receipt of key non-oil and gas revenues - both the federal budget and the budget system as a whole - there is a steady positive trend.\n\nNon-oil and gas revenues of the federal budget amounted to 5,500 billion rubles and increased by 5% yoy. The dynamics of receipt of the largest non-oil and gas revenues of the federal budget (turnover taxes, income tax) normalized after a temporary decrease in January associated with the action of one-time factors (accelerated procedure for VAT refunds, return of income tax overpayments) and entered a steadily positive area, including 2021 level (as less subject to statistical base effects).\n\nIn general, the volume and trajectory of non-oil and gas revenues in January-April 2023 is in line with the dynamics laid down during the formation of the budget law (No. 466-FZ of December 5, 2022).\n\nOil and gas revenues amounted to 2,282 billion rubles and decreased by 52% yoy, which is associated with a high base of comparison last year, a decrease in Urals oil prices and a decrease in natural gas exports. The monthly dynamics of oil and gas revenues is gradually entering a stable trajectory corresponding to their base level (8 trillion rubles a year).\n\nClarification of the mechanism for determining the tax base for \"oil\" taxes and the reduction of the corresponding price discounts will contribute to a further recovery of tax revenues from the oil sector during the year - especially in the second half of the year.\n\nAt the same time, the use of NWF funds to cover lost oil and gas revenues in accordance with the parameters of the \u201cbudget rule\u201d ensures the stability of the budget system against fluctuations in oil and gas revenues.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, the volume of federal budget expenditures in January-April 2023 amounted to  11,206 billion rubles , exceeding the figures for the same period last year by 26% y/y. The monthly dynamics of the execution of federal budget expenditures has slowed down since March (+3.9% yoy in April 2023) after accelerated financing of certain contracted expenditures in January-February.\n\nIn general, in 2023, the volume of federal budget expenditures will be formed based on the maximum amount of budget appropriations approved in the budget law (No. 466-FZ) and the amount of additional non-oil and gas revenues if they are formed during the year (in accordance with the norms of the \u201cbudget rule\u201d ).

At the same time, in terms of receipt of key non-oil and gas revenues - both the federal budget and the budget system as a whole - there is a steady positive trend.</p>\n\n<p>Non-oil and gas revenues of the federal budget amounted to 5,500 billion rubles and increased by 5% yoy. The dynamics of receipt of the largest non-oil and gas revenues of the federal budget (turnover taxes, income tax) normalized after a temporary decrease in January associated with the action of one-time factors (accelerated procedure for VAT refunds, return of income tax overpayments) and entered a steadily positive area, including 2021 level (as less subject to statistical base effects).</p>\n\n<p>In general, the volume and trajectory of non-oil and gas revenues in January-April 2023 is in line with the dynamics laid down during the formation of the budget law (No. 466-FZ of December 5, 2022).</p>\n\n<p>Oil and gas revenues amounted to 2,282 billion rubles and decreased by 52% yoy, which is associated with a high base of comparison last year, a decrease in Urals oil prices and a decrease in natural gas exports. The monthly dynamics of oil and gas revenues is gradually entering a stable trajectory corresponding to their base level (8 trillion rubles a year).</p>\n\n<p>Clarification of the mechanism for determining the tax base for &quot;oil&quot; taxes and the reduction of the corresponding price discounts will contribute to a further recovery of tax revenues from the oil sector during the year - especially in the second half of the year.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the use of NWF funds to cover lost oil and gas revenues in accordance with the parameters of the \u201cbudget rule\u201d ensures the stability of the budget system against fluctuations in oil and gas revenues.</p>\n\n<p>According to preliminary estimates, the volume of federal budget expenditures in January-April 2023 amounted to  11,206 billion rubles , exceeding the figures for the same period last year by 26% y/y. The monthly dynamics of the execution of federal budget expenditures has slowed down since March (+3.9% yoy in April 2023) after accelerated financing of certain contracted expenditures in January-February.</p>\n\n<p>In general, in 2023, the volume of federal budget expenditures will be formed based on the maximum amount of budget appropriations approved in the budget law (No. 466-FZ) and the amount of additional non-oil and gas revenues if they are formed during the year (in accordance with the norms of the \u201cbudget rule\u201d ). This ensures the stability of the primary structural deficit at the level of the parameters of the budget law (No. 466-FZ).</p>\n\n<p>Increased flexibility in managing the structure of marginal budgetary appropriations in 2023, including, if necessary, directing them to contingencies, is ensured by the presence of unallocated reserves, as well as the release of budgetary appropriations in the amount of 1,496 billion rubles due to an advance transfer to the Pension and Social Insurance Fund in December 2022 individual transfers envisaged for 2023.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "On number 2, it's less about the air assault role and more about using what you have and institutional knowledge and experience that is being drawn upon. It's a lot like the discussion around unguided missile barrages from helicopters where many were criticizing their use because it didn't seem particularly effective. But, in war, you use what you have because you have it. Helicopters might not be doing the job you exactly want them to do by acting as mobile MLRS platforms, but what else are you going to use them for when their primary role isn't available? \n\nIt's similar with air assault units. You use what you have, not what you want. Air assault/airborne units have a long history of being used outside of their intended role (101st at Bastogne) because they are useful soldiers even if they aren't jumping out of planes.\n\nOutside of that, air assault units normally have a higher quality of recruitment because they are seen as \"elite\", or near elite. When in war, you really have to lean into what works in the now, and this is conjecture, but I would imagine the Ukrainian air assault units have a higher than normal quality command structure and experience thanks to their \"elite\" status, so making more units from them retains that institutional knowledge and familiarity even if they aren't jumping out of planes/helicopters.\n\nIt's also important to realize that even in war time, different groupings in a military will still compete for relevancy.

It&#39;s a lot like the discussion around unguided missile barrages from helicopters where many were criticizing their use because it didn&#39;t seem particularly effective. But, in war, you use what you have because you have it. Helicopters might not be doing the job you exactly want them to do by acting as mobile MLRS platforms, but what else are you going to use them for when their primary role isn&#39;t available? </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s similar with air assault units. You use what you have, not what you want. Air assault/airborne units have a long history of being used outside of their intended role (101st at Bastogne) because they are useful soldiers even if they aren&#39;t jumping out of planes.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of that, air assault units normally have a higher quality of recruitment because they are seen as &quot;elite&quot;, or near elite. When in war, you really have to lean into what works in the now, and this is conjecture, but I would imagine the Ukrainian air assault units have a higher than normal quality command structure and experience thanks to their &quot;elite&quot; status, so making more units from them retains that institutional knowledge and familiarity even if they aren&#39;t jumping out of planes/helicopters.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also important to realize that even in war time, different groupings in a military will still compete for relevancy. If the air assault units are doing well, they will get more support even if they are fulfilling a role not quite like what they were originally created for and their command will fight to be a more important part of the war.</p>\n\n<p>I would also look at <a href=\"/u/offogredux\">u/offogredux</a> for more insight, as he would be able to better explain the Ukrainian air assault units specifically.</p>\n</div>",

From the first article:\n\n>The reluctance of most ordinary Russians to talk about the war is striking. And the regime is not at all opposed to such sentiments.\n\n>\u201cFor the majority of Russians, it is seemingly becoming increasingly important not to experience what is happening at all,\u201d says St Petersburg-based political scientist Grigory Golosov. \u201cThe political passivity of the majority represents the core social basis for the Putin regime\u2019s existence. This type of regime is always based on passivity \u2013 it is not a mobilization regime.\u201d Putin, Golosov believes, \u201chas to pretend that the tragedy in Ukraine is a kind of situation amid which normal life is possible.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe average Russian is clearly not eager to fight. He tries to keep his distance from the war and, if possible, not to think about it at all.\u201d\n\n\nAlso, Germany in WW2 is probably the worst example you could have used. Not only did the Germans have spectacular success in the first couple years of the war, which undoubtedly helped morale, recruiting and spirit, but the historical context of WW1 and the hardships many Germans had to endure in the intervening periods is nothing like what Russia has experienced. The West was throwing money at Russia trying to trade with it, overlooking each of Putin's transgressions and as the middle-class in Russia grew thanks in large part to Western overreliance on Russia's vast natural resource wealth. The German's had an entirely antithetical experience in almost every way. Russia was on the upswing till Putin's blunders, Germany wasn't.",

From the first article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reluctance of most ordinary Russians to talk about the war is striking. And the regime is not at all opposed to such sentiments.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor the majority of Russians, it is seemingly becoming increasingly important not to experience what is happening at all,\u201d says St Petersburg-based political scientist Grigory Golosov. \u201cThe political passivity of the majority represents the core social basis for the Putin regime\u2019s existence. This type of regime is always based on passivity \u2013 it is not a mobilization regime.\u201d Putin, Golosov believes, \u201chas to pretend that the tragedy in Ukraine is a kind of situation amid which normal life is possible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe average Russian is clearly not eager to fight. He tries to keep his distance from the war and, if possible, not to think about it at all.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, Germany in WW2 is probably the worst example you could have used. Not only did the Germans have spectacular success in the first couple years of the war, which undoubtedly helped morale, recruiting and spirit, but the historical context of WW1 and the hardships many Germans had to endure in the intervening periods is nothing like what Russia has experienced. The West was throwing money at Russia trying to trade with it, overlooking each of Putin&#39;s transgressions and as the middle-class in Russia grew thanks in large part to Western overreliance on Russia&#39;s vast natural resource wealth. The German&#39;s had an entirely antithetical experience in almost every way. Russia was on the upswing till Putin&#39;s blunders, Germany wasn&#39;t.</p>\n</div>",
