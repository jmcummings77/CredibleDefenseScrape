There are a few interesting points that I found in this one (understanding that Sergii is not a neutral observer and so may not always be telling the truth as he sees it). In no particular order:\n\n- Sergii specifically names Kharkiv as a place where a lot of the tanks are rebuilt / maintained / repaired. I think this has been a point of discussion here a few times with people sometimes assuming that the destruction and vulnerability to missile attacks there has meant that its contribution to the war is negligible.\n- A few interesting comments on the fight around Soledar / bakhmut. Sergii raised the idea that Ukraine may be keen to keep fighting there so that Russians pull forces away from other fronts allowing offensive opportunities for Ukraine. Regarding tactical withdrawl etc, he mentioned that psychologically Ukrainians don't really want to concede any land, and while its easy to say you can withdraw at some point you have to stop the Russians and you cannot withdraw for ever etc. Mention of the battles near Severodonetsk and how when Ukraine finally withdrew that the Russians were too spent to follow up, so presumably a similar intent here.\n- Interesting comments about the water supply canal to Crimea - Sergii said that the Russians have not maintained most of the irrigation channels for years and they have fallen into disrepair so while they provide some water to north Crimea they don't do much for the rest, and as such not much point spending resources trying to cut it off. \n- On Russian offensives, Sergii seems concerned that a Russian attack from the Kreminna and Svatove direction (I could have misunderstood this part) could reverse much of Ukranian gains, and that there has been significant build up of forces there. He was dismissive of any attack from Belarus or from North of Kharkiv \n- Ukraine would likely target Melitopol next, followed by crimea before anything else. If Melitopol could be secured, he felt that Crimea was very difficult to defend for the Russians. This has been discussed here before with I think most being of the opinion that the narrow land bridge would be easy to defend. Did not think there would be resistance from civilians in Crimea.

            "body": ">will a small trickle of modern tanks bring any serious impact from a big picture standpoint (like himars level or something of the like).\n\nVery unlikely. \n\nHIMARS were so effective for a couple reasons. One, the Russians got extremely complacent and lazy with how they set up massive brigade and division level ammo supply points (ASP) in particular, which happened after about three months of positional fighting as part of set piece battles that relied heavily on high artillery fire rates that meant cutting corners to work, especially considering how bad Russia is at logistics and how utterly sloppy they are, the unsafe practices they follow. The Ukrainians had long range PGMs before HIMARS, but they weren't nearly as accurate nor did they have much ammo. Second, the Ukrainians had access to world class targeting intelligence, a lot of it provided by NATO, that could find those ASP. Together that was a perfect storm. Add in a third issue, the inflexible Russians, with junior and mid level commanders lacking the initiative to react quickly, took an absurdly long time to react.\n\nFor the HIMARS to tank analogy to work, the Russian front line defenses would need to be paper thin, not well built, barely manned, barely any ATGM, no AT mines, barely any artillery, no local reserves, etc. That way a NATO third generation MBT, with SA, FCS, and armor upgrades, could break right through the defenses without heavy losses, allowing deep penetrations that can be exploited operationally.\n\nHowever, that's not how the Russians are set up. Their defenses are stout, manned, in depth. AT Mines are everywhere and all modem MBTs are still very susceptible to them. They have the same AT weapons that were the ones causing the frequent Merkava, Abrams, Leopard kills in places like Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and Syria. So NATO MBTs are still going to take pretty heavy losses, even if used in conjunction with well executed combined arms (arty, infantry, engineers, EW, etc). \n\nWhat the Ukrainians need is **a lot** of them to accomplish something significant. Heavily massed in one location, at least 2-3 brigades worth on a narrow front if not more, so when they take losses they still have the remaining strength to overwhelm the Russian defenders. However, that means 500-1,000, likely more than less, which isn't realistic considering all the variables that come into play with giving them away, which is another conversation altogether. \n\nThough I might be wrong. I guess it's possible to use them as breakthrough heavy tank companies in every tank brigade, so they could lead attacks that would be supported by the COMBLOC and UA tanks to their immediate rear, kind of like a modern [panzer wedge](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Cunha-Panzerkeil.png).\n\nThat said, smaller numbers of NATO MBTd trickling in will still have positive effects though. Their thermals are better than most of what is available in Ukraine in either side, so they'll spot targets well. They have much better protection, they're essentially breakthrough tanks.

One, the Russians got extremely complacent and lazy with how they set up massive brigade and division level ammo supply points (ASP) in particular, which happened after about three months of positional fighting as part of set piece battles that relied heavily on high artillery fire rates that meant cutting corners to work, especially considering how bad Russia is at logistics and how utterly sloppy they are, the unsafe practices they follow. The Ukrainians had long range PGMs before HIMARS, but they weren&#39;t nearly as accurate nor did they have much ammo. Second, the Ukrainians had access to world class targeting intelligence, a lot of it provided by NATO, that could find those ASP. Together that was a perfect storm. Add in a third issue, the inflexible Russians, with junior and mid level commanders lacking the initiative to react quickly, took an absurdly long time to react.</p>\n\n<p>For the HIMARS to tank analogy to work, the Russian front line defenses would need to be paper thin, not well built, barely manned, barely any ATGM, no AT mines, barely any artillery, no local reserves, etc. That way a NATO third generation MBT, with SA, FCS, and armor upgrades, could break right through the defenses without heavy losses, allowing deep penetrations that can be exploited operationally.</p>\n\n<p>However, that&#39;s not how the Russians are set up. Their defenses are stout, manned, in depth. AT Mines are everywhere and all modem MBTs are still very susceptible to them. They have the same AT weapons that were the ones causing the frequent Merkava, Abrams, Leopard kills in places like Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and Syria. So NATO MBTs are still going to take pretty heavy losses, even if used in conjunction with well executed combined arms (arty, infantry, engineers, EW, etc). </p>\n\n<p>What the Ukrainians need is <strong>a lot</strong> of them to accomplish something significant. Heavily massed in one location, at least 2-3 brigades worth on a narrow front if not more, so when they take losses they still have the remaining strength to overwhelm the Russian defenders. However, that means 500-1,000, likely more than less, which isn&#39;t realistic considering all the variables that come into play with giving them away, which is another conversation altogether. </p>\n\n<p>Though I might be wrong. I guess it&#39;s possible to use them as breakthrough heavy tank companies in every tank brigade, so they could lead attacks that would be supported by the COMBLOC and UA tanks to their immediate rear, kind of like a modern <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Cunha-Panzerkeil.png\">panzer wedge</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That said, smaller numbers of NATO MBTd trickling in will still have positive effects though. Their thermals are better than most of what is available in Ukraine in either side, so they&#39;ll spot targets well. They have much better protection, they&#39;re essentially breakthrough tanks. They have much better survivability after they get killed (even k-kill) so the crews can be reused with new tanks. Etc. Assuming they&#39;re used well, maintained well, etc.</p>\n</div>",

In 1918 the Germans were a mostly spent force trying to use whatever amount of trained men they had left along with anyone they could find to conscript or convince to come to the war to do one last push against an enemy that while also exhausted in many ways was supported by the Americans and becoming increasingly better equipped and skilled at the combined arms needed to break the stalemate. I would draw some parallels between Battle of Amiens and some of the offensives that the Ukrainians have done in that both show an evolving force that is finally putting together all the pieces needed to do proper combined arms. \n\nIn those ways it reminds me of the Russian force. Both the Germans and the Russians had an initial success phase where they captured large amounts of territory then it stalled due to their capacity to support and maintain the offensive. Then it turned into brutal trench and artillery warfare, I would look at the battle over severodonetsk and the Donbas in general and say it reminds me a lot of the fight at Verdun. Once Russia had exhausted itself you saw the Ukrainians able to make gains and put together the combined arms needed to push them back. Now with mobilization Russia is going to try something that might remind us of the spring 1918 offensive but as you pointed out they will have far less trained troops to do it.

In 1918 the Germans were a mostly spent force trying to use whatever amount of trained men they had left along with anyone they could find to conscript or convince to come to the war to do one last push against an enemy that while also exhausted in many ways was supported by the Americans and becoming increasingly better equipped and skilled at the combined arms needed to break the stalemate. I would draw some parallels between Battle of Amiens and some of the offensives that the Ukrainians have done in that both show an evolving force that is finally putting together all the pieces needed to do proper combined arms. </p>\n\n<p>In those ways it reminds me of the Russian force. Both the Germans and the Russians had an initial success phase where they captured large amounts of territory then it stalled due to their capacity to support and maintain the offensive. Then it turned into brutal trench and artillery warfare, I would look at the battle over severodonetsk and the Donbas in general and say it reminds me a lot of the fight at Verdun. Once Russia had exhausted itself you saw the Ukrainians able to make gains and put together the combined arms needed to push them back. Now with mobilization Russia is going to try something that might remind us of the spring 1918 offensive but as you pointed out they will have far less trained troops to do it. Meanwhile Ukraine is gearing up with more training and heavy equipment from the west to potentially come in with the knock out blow sometime later this year that will feature more technologically advanced weapons.</p>\n\n<p>If this proves the course the war takes then I think we would see a peace treaty late next year with Russia agreeing to terms that are favorable to Ukraine once the writing is truly on the wall.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Russia does use pallets, you can see them in many videos. They just dont use them the same as NATO does, nor as another user points out do they use container based shipping.\n\nThink of it like this, with logistics you have cost and manpower issues. Moving things by hand is very manpower intensive, but cheap. Get a few guys, throw shit into a truck, drive truck to destination, pull stuff off. Simple, easy, but a LOT of work. Conversely, containerized and palletized logistics are VERY expensive. And they require a small number of very specialized soldiers to do. Youre basically electronically tracking shipments globally, so that someone in Washington can tell someone in Korea where theyre container is, whats in it, where it is, and when itll arrive. That means you have to keep good track from start to finish of whats where, AND you need to digitize it to distribute it and make it useful. This is highly efficient and replaces a lot of manpower, and indeed a lot of potential for inefficiency, waste, and theft. BUT! it costs a lot to set up, digitization and new IT represent pretty significant upfront capital investments, and then you need people trained and proficient to keep the system running. \n\nSo in a way it makes sense, Russia has a conscript army filled with lots of guys with a little training. Russia also cant, or doesn't want, to shell out significant capital to implement these IT systems. So they use their manpower to solve the problem. Conversely, capital investment is not an issue for the US, nor is training. Rather for political reasons the DoD has a strong need to cut down on supply-side manpower. This is especially true with the Army, which sees its supply services as a drag on front end manpower. Id also point out that the US Army actually has a very different incentive structure, which makes logistics a very attractive option for soldiers. Its become a meme, but I know a bunch of guys who got forklift certified in the Army and now have very cushy middle-class jobs. And a lot of private sector companies would love to hire an officer who had experience in a supply battalion. Even better if they can get a Nat Guard officer running supply, who can bring active best practices into their company. Unlike in Russia, in the US LOG is a legit way to retire into middle class prosperity. *If* you take it seriously, and if the Army takes it seriously. Which they do.",

I guess South Korea could be attacked through North Korea, but I don't even know if South Korea would involve itself in a Taiwan war, so would China be willing to risk drawing South Korea's direct involvement just to distract the US bases there?  Opening a multi-front war seems like suicide for China.  I also don't know that North Korea would actually be willing to let China use their territory to stage an invasion (and thus make NK a legitimate target as well).\n\nThe Philippines has all the same challenges of a *very* long-range amphibious invasion like Japan, though it is admittedly a much weaker target than even Taiwan, so maybe a US Army presence there might be worthwhile.  I still don't see China having the resources to conduct *more than one* world-record scale invasion *at the same time*.  \n\nIt's much more likely that they would only be targetting US bases in the Philippines (and Korea and Japan and Guam, etc.) with long-range precision missile strikes (hypersonic, ballistic, and fighter/bomber-launched).  Not only would these kinds of attacks be effective, less risky, and require less resources from China, but limiting their strikes to missiles that *only* affect US bases would reduce the chances of pulling the host countries into direct conflict with China, which a ground-based invasion definitely risks, and which would be wholly counterproductive unless China has realistic ambitions of annexing those territories as well (lol).\n\nSo, yes, the Army might be of limited usefulness in an invasion, but only as a definitive deterrent to actions that China would be unlikely to undertake in the first place.  \n\nI'm not sure who is in charge of base defenses (like anti-air for Naval and Air bases), but this is definitely a concern for Japan, South Korea, Philippines, etc., so this could be another crucial role for the Army in a potential conflict with China.\n\nThe point which the OP of this comment thread was making, and I was supporting, is that if we are talking about funding and resources for the different branches based on the most likely and dangerous future threat, the Army is probably the *least* important - not that they would have no use whatsoever.  The Army, like you said, is a great deterrent.  It's also a backup or final card in your pocket: you don't want to get to the point where the US actually needs to bring its massive and powerful Army to bear.

I guess South Korea could be attacked through North Korea, but I don&#39;t even know if South Korea would involve itself in a Taiwan war, so would China be willing to risk drawing South Korea&#39;s direct involvement just to distract the US bases there?  Opening a multi-front war seems like suicide for China.  I also don&#39;t know that North Korea would actually be willing to let China use their territory to stage an invasion (and thus make NK a legitimate target as well).</p>\n\n<p>The Philippines has all the same challenges of a <em>very</em> long-range amphibious invasion like Japan, though it is admittedly a much weaker target than even Taiwan, so maybe a US Army presence there might be worthwhile.  I still don&#39;t see China having the resources to conduct <em>more than one</em> world-record scale invasion <em>at the same time</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s much more likely that they would only be targetting US bases in the Philippines (and Korea and Japan and Guam, etc.) with long-range precision missile strikes (hypersonic, ballistic, and fighter/bomber-launched).  Not only would these kinds of attacks be effective, less risky, and require less resources from China, but limiting their strikes to missiles that <em>only</em> affect US bases would reduce the chances of pulling the host countries into direct conflict with China, which a ground-based invasion definitely risks, and which would be wholly counterproductive unless China has realistic ambitions of annexing those territories as well (lol).</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, the Army might be of limited usefulness in an invasion, but only as a definitive deterrent to actions that China would be unlikely to undertake in the first place.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure who is in charge of base defenses (like anti-air for Naval and Air bases), but this is definitely a concern for Japan, South Korea, Philippines, etc., so this could be another crucial role for the Army in a potential conflict with China.</p>\n\n<p>The point which the OP of this comment thread was making, and I was supporting, is that if we are talking about funding and resources for the different branches based on the most likely and dangerous future threat, the Army is probably the <em>least</em> important - not that they would have no use whatsoever.  The Army, like you said, is a great deterrent.  It&#39;s also a backup or final card in your pocket: you don&#39;t want to get to the point where the US actually needs to bring its massive and powerful Army to bear.  It&#39;s a slower and unwieldy force that takes time to ramp up, but god help you if the US Army gets your attention.  </p>\n\n<p>I just don&#39;t see them playing a particularly <em>active</em> role in a theoretical conflict with China, because an invasion of China proper also risks a dangerous response.</p>\n</div>",

Explain what the consequences of that would be in terms of war, refugees, nuclear non-proliferation, etc etc etc. If you want to make the argument that all of those things can be overcome \u2014 or that those risks are outweighed by the benefits \u2014 fine. But then make that cost-benefit analysis explicit and have the courage to own it.  \n> \n> For my part, I\u2019ve been clear about why I think Russian disintegration is both unlikely and undesirable (in the CEPA piece posted earlier). Much better \u2014 and easier, I think, though still difficult \u2014 to help push a post-war Russia in the direction of real federalism.  \n>   \n\nhttps://twitter.com/samagreene/status/1613192020079808516",

Without such evidence and analysis, harping on the disintegration \u201cargument\u201d serves, I think, one or both of two purposes. For some, it may be another form of magical thinking, like the hope that Putin is sick or that there will a coup or a meteor will hit his motorcade. For other proponents of the disintegration argument, though, this increasingly looks like an attempt to get western governments not to prepare for Russian disintegration \u2014 but actively to seek to bring it about.  </p>\n\n<p>If Russian disintegration is your aim, so be it \u2014 but then take the analysis one or two steps further. Explain what the consequences of that would be in terms of war, refugees, nuclear non-proliferation, etc etc etc. If you want to make the argument that all of those things can be overcome \u2014 or that those risks are outweighed by the benefits \u2014 fine. But then make that cost-benefit analysis explicit and have the courage to own it.  </p>\n\n<p>For my part, I\u2019ve been clear about why I think Russian disintegration is both unlikely and undesirable (in the CEPA piece posted earlier). Much better \u2014 and easier, I think, though still difficult \u2014 to help push a post-war Russia in the direction of real federalism.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/samagreene/status/1613192020079808516\">https://twitter.com/samagreene/status/1613192020079808516</a></p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I think anyone hoping for a Soviet-style dissolution is going to be disappointed. Moscow and Saint Petersburg are the axis upon which the Russian state turns. As long as Moscow stands, there will never be dissolution. To use a Western European example, consider France. Paris is the French Moscow, and Marseilles the French Petersburg. Those cities define French culture and are the core urban metropoles of the French nation, upon which the French government and state can reliably collect taxes and manpower for their armies. But Paris is not France. France contains unique and different cultures, which are decidedly not French, which include but are not limited to:\n\n- The Basque\n\n- The Occitans\n\n- The Alsatians \n\n- The Bretons \n\n- The Normans\n\n- The Swiss (partially)\n\n- The people of the Vendee.\n\nAnd many more besides. France is a mashed up amalgamation of cousin cultures, held together by a common-ish culture but also by sheer force of centralized population power that Paris and to a lesser extent Marseilles can project. We can define Russia to the same extent. \n\nRussia contains Russians, but also the Tartars, the Tuvans, the Altai, the Sibir, the Kazans, the Tajiks, the Dagestani and Chechens and so much more besides, each colonized by Russia over many centuries. None of those places will ever have full autonomy (the power to raise taxes and an independent army) for the weight at the center of the Metropole overcomes all. \n\nLet's game this out. Let's say, Russia's army is fully expelled from Ukraine. There are riots in all major Russian settlements. Putin has been deposed and replaced by a cadre of either neo-Soviet restorationists or a group of army officers. In that environ, you'd think the fruit would be ripe for all those areas aforementioned to attempt to break free. But geography and demography seal their fate before the first shot is fired. \n\nE.g. let's say an ethnic uprising occurs in two areas: Chechnya and Tuva. Already, you see an issue: they are separated by thousands of km, a literal continent standing between them. So even though their interests would align, they would not be able to coalesce their forces. Then you have population: Moscow and the surrounding cities would quickly be pacified, and from that core, Russian power would expand outwards. And simply: there are more people in that Russian core than there will ever be in those distant, far-off areas they colonized. Every non-Russian polity could mobilize 100% and they still wouldn't overcome Russian population numbers.\n\nWe of course don't need to pretend to invent a scenario: we have history to guide us. First, general European history: where multi-ethnic states exist, so long as the majority culture is greater than the sum of the minority, the state will always have control over that minority (assuming foreign powers don't change the borders). This is why Catalonia is Spain, why Wales is British, why Sicily is Italian, and so on. And then Russian history: the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922 plainly shows us how a centralized Russian polity in the heart of the Russian country can expand and reassert control All Russia.\n\nSo then: what about the USSR? How was Ukraine et al able to break free from the Russian core? A couple attributes:\n\n- Demography. Ukraine and Central Asia, while not as large as Russia, have far more people than the smaller nations within Russia have at present; they are no pushovers.\n\n- Economic collapse: the ability to restrain independent Ukraine et al was restrained by the collapse of the Soviet and then Russian economy. It's a classic case of there's bigger fish to fry.\n\n- The USSR was not Russian. While it was a legal fiction initially, over time, the fiction became reality. A Ukrainian born in Soviet Ukraine considered himself Ukrainian, for most Soviet Ukraine's history. While this was not 100% true 100% of the time, it is true enough that it did become the lived reality we now exist in. Soviet attempts to stop ethnic nationalism were very much start-stop measures, like a car sputtering to the engine shop. \n\n- This allowed the nascent 14 other Soviet nations (besides Russia) to form their own unique cultural identities beyond just Russian. This in turn grew their nationalism, but so long as the Soviet Union remained strong and united, this was not an unsolvable issue.\n\n- Alas for Russia, Russia itself was not immune to nationalism. When Gorbachev started his reforms, Russian elites agitated for and got their own Russian Soviet government--so you had the Soviet supragovernment and a Russian government nearly just as large, with the Soviets supposed to be in control. This created a power struggle for the Russian-Moscow core: who will rule All-Russia from that core, Gorbachev or Yeltsin? When hardliners attempted to coup Gorbachev, the answer came. The Soviet state collapsed. In the power vacuum, Yeltsin assumed control. \n\n- In this environment, Yeltsin promoted Russia over the Soviet nation. And the Soviet nation was remembered then as a voluntary union of nation-states that could be broken up at any time, at least that's what the original treaty said. So when the time came for Ukraine to break off, Moscow was preoccupied (with founding a new state & the collapsing economy), plus a historical perspective that Ukraine was real, independent, and could break off from the Soviet state at any time if they so wished. Yeltsin was happy enough controlling the area Soviet Russia had been granted. And so, absent any feeling that this was some world historical crime (as Putin sees it), Ukraine left the Soviet Union and became de jure independent from Russia with little fuss.\n\nOf course, nationalism has only grown since the collapse of the Soviet state. Putin rejects the strict boundaries created for the Soviet Russian state and seeks instead to restore ancien Russia--a time when Moscow and Petersburg really did dominate Ukraine. This whole current conflict between the two is an attempt to relitigate the collapse of the Soviet Union--as if Russia did not inherently agree to Ukrainian independence in the 90s.\n\nI will say as a final note: you can make the same conclusions about China as you can Russia--indeed, most modern countries have this attribute of a majority culture dominating minority cultures--where the minorities will never experience true independence. Just as we won't see a free and independent Brittany this century, neither will see a free independent Tibet, Uyghur state, or any other Chinese minority polity--absent another civil war, of course. Which, if you care at all about nuclear non-proliferation, mass refugees, general human suffering--you should not be wishing for.\n\nThis all should serve to inform where America spends its time and energies. Sometimes, America gets too poetic and quixotic about fulfilling Wilson's 14 points to the letter, when a small dose of reality would do us all a huge favor when budgeting against adversaries.",

But there's so much misinformation going around so I would like someone to clarify if what I have is wrong? [First video NSFW](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1092teb/gnarly_footage_of_a_russian_soldier_ambushing_and/)\n\n[Second video NSFW](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/109imkr/second_part_of_ru_pov_wagnerites_storming_ua/)\n\nSo first some people said that the Russian soldier was a wagner soldier that wore a Ukrainian uniform and that's why the Ukranian soldiers were confused and said \"Ours\" or friendlies or something along that lines(Totally disregarding that they just got likely hit by the grenade the Russian soldier threw just second before at their foxhole and are stunned and even more stunned an enemy would come from behind them)\n\nThen the second part/new video(Unsure if its the same cameraman) came out showing the continued fire fight before running back to the foxhole the entire time we see Russian soldiers wearing Russian camo and/or Red tapes identifying them as Russian soldiers(I'm not to upto date with camos but they look Russian to me). Then some people started saying that the older man in the foxhole was 'identifed' as a Wagner recruit and that the reason he's saying \"Friendly/ours\" is that he's a wagner recruit in stolen Ukranian uniform... And that the entire incident is a Russian friendly fire incident.\n\nNow I've also seen links to an Instagram said to be from the younger guy on the left in the foxhole and its a Ukranian soldiers instagram, I've also seen links to a facebook page saying he's been missing/not in contact since the end of December.\n\nSome also say its from Kremmina, does Wagner operate in Kremmina?\n\nNow I think the simplest explanation is that it is what we see, Russians managed to flank a Ukranian position and managed to overwhelm it, nothing more nothing less. And as I see it that way I feel its a massive disrespect to paint the Ukranian soldiers that died as 'Russians/wagners' to try and discredit this small Russian 'victory' as a friendly fire accident.\n\nAnyway I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, do I have the wrong conclusion/missing information?",

But there&#39;s so much misinformation going around so I would like someone to clarify if what I have is wrong? <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1092teb/gnarly_footage_of_a_russian_soldier_ambushing_and/\">First video NSFW</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/109imkr/second_part_of_ru_pov_wagnerites_storming_ua/\">Second video NSFW</a></p>\n\n<p>So first some people said that the Russian soldier was a wagner soldier that wore a Ukrainian uniform and that&#39;s why the Ukranian soldiers were confused and said &quot;Ours&quot; or friendlies or something along that lines(Totally disregarding that they just got likely hit by the grenade the Russian soldier threw just second before at their foxhole and are stunned and even more stunned an enemy would come from behind them)</p>\n\n<p>Then the second part/new video(Unsure if its the same cameraman) came out showing the continued fire fight before running back to the foxhole the entire time we see Russian soldiers wearing Russian camo and/or Red tapes identifying them as Russian soldiers(I&#39;m not to upto date with camos but they look Russian to me). Then some people started saying that the older man in the foxhole was &#39;identifed&#39; as a Wagner recruit and that the reason he&#39;s saying &quot;Friendly/ours&quot; is that he&#39;s a wagner recruit in stolen Ukranian uniform... And that the entire incident is a Russian friendly fire incident.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;ve also seen links to an Instagram said to be from the younger guy on the left in the foxhole and its a Ukranian soldiers instagram, I&#39;ve also seen links to a facebook page saying he&#39;s been missing/not in contact since the end of December.</p>\n\n<p>Some also say its from Kremmina, does Wagner operate in Kremmina?</p>\n\n<p>Now I think the simplest explanation is that it is what we see, Russians managed to flank a Ukranian position and managed to overwhelm it, nothing more nothing less. And as I see it that way I feel its a massive disrespect to paint the Ukranian soldiers that died as &#39;Russians/wagners&#39; to try and discredit this small Russian &#39;victory&#39; as a friendly fire accident.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on this, do I have the wrong conclusion/missing information?</p>\n</div>",

The interview is already more than 30 hours old, so things may have changed. As always, loads of salt, but here are some excerpts:\n\n\n>(Interviewer): Mr.Oleksandr, thank you for agreeing to talk, and I will start with the main question: who controls Soledar now?\n\n \n>(Oleksandr): The Armed Forces of Ukraine fully control the situation [the conversation was recorded at 12 o\u2019clock on January 11 \u2013 remark]. It would be incorrect to say the current situation as the fighting continues.\n\n>It is a bit funny to watch the enemy\u2019s statements because it happens that a bunch of \u201cWagnerites\u201d will run in, infiltrate into some building in the industrial zone, and, while we have not yet had time to \u201csmoke them out\u201d, will record a video. And the next day, we will find out they are \u201ctwo hundredth\u201d.\n\n>Fighting and operations are going on there now. If I talk in detail about what and how I will harm the guys. But the situation is controlled by the Armed Forces.\n\n \n\n>(I): \u201cFighting continues\u201d \u2013 that is, Russians do not occupy the city?\n\n \n\n>(O): No, it is not.\n\n \n\n>(I):  Can you talk about the percentage of the city that is currently controlled by the Ukrainian army?\n\n\n>(O): It would be incorrect. And besides, the situation can change in half a day. The dynamics are very high.\n\n>(I):  The potential encirclement of the city has been actively discussed for several days. As a person from inside this defense, tell us how possible it is?\n\n>(O): It was, but we are leveling the situation. Our unit did not sink and did not go anywhere. We have been standing, and we are still standing.\n\n>Our brigade has a very powerful battle management, and all commanders are in their places. Logistics, surveillance, and reconnaissance are well established. This allows us to hold our positions around the clock. We even planned an assault, that is, the restoration of positions.\n\n>But there was such a situation that our neighboring units on the right and left were not as effective as we were. Therefore, the enemy managed to bypass us on the flanks. Yes, it was possible [potential encirclement], but now the situation is changing.\n\n >(I):  And, in your opinion, is the situation changing for the better?\n\n >(O): Yes, so far the dynamics is positive. Let\u2019s see what will happen next. Their tactic is to send people to die, both \u201cprisoners\u201d and \u201cWagnerites\u201d. As much as I saw their \u201c200s\u201d, they were without first aid kits.\n\n>(I): Is the Bakhmut-Siversk highway, which runs through Soledar, currently under Russian fire control?\n\n \n>(O): Minus [that is \u201cno\u201d in military slang]. There was such a period, but as far as I know, the situation has stabilized.\n\n>(I): Since August, Soledar was almost an impregnable fortress in the Bakhmut direction, in particular due to the efforts of the 93rd Brigade. At what point did the situation deteriorate sharply? What went wrong?\n\n \n\n>(O): As far as I know, the 93rd Brigade is very powerful and mechanized, with experience in the Donetsk direction, Opytne, Donetsk Airport. They have a lot of experience in both defensive and offensive actions. Therefore, when they stood on their borders, it was not a problem for them to restrain the enemy.\n\n \n\n>I understand that they are replaced by new infantry units, infantry brigades, where there is often a problem with management and control. I cannot say that this is someone\u2019s fault because we are forming all these units in the dynamics, and commanders may not have combat experience.\n\n>But from what I see, the command is trying to dilute experienced units or quickly send experienced brigades to where there are problems.\n\n >(I): According to my information, it was a surprise for the Ukrainian military that the Russians broke through the flanks from Yakovlivka, which is located north of Soledar, and Pidhorodne, which is south of Soledar.\n>Do I understand correctly that these were the areas where the newly formed units were located?\n\n \n\n>(O): Yes, they were.\n\n \n\n>(I):  That is, the reason for the breakthrough of Soledar\u2019s defense is that untrained military was deployed in some areas?\n\n \n\n>(O): Perhaps so, but I was not in these units, I do not know exactly about their level of training.\n\n>But what is the most important thing in a unit? Established communication, level of management, adequacy of commanders, moral and psychological state of people. It is necessary to work on all this before sending the unit to the hot areas.\n\n \n\n>(I): And when did the escalation in Soledar begin \u2013 somewhere before the New Year?\n\n \n\n>(O): Somewhere like that because on December 31, we were given the task to go and take the lines on January 1. We could not even celebrate the New Year [smiles].\n\n \n\n>We had just returned from Kurdyumivka [a village south of Bakhmut, the dominant height] where we successfully stormed the enemy positions. More precisely, in front of Kurdyumivka, we regained control there, consolidated our positions, and were replaced by infantry units.\n\n \n\n>(I): If you have already mentioned Kurdyumivka, tell us how the situation is developing south of Bakhmut? Is it true that the Russians are mostly along the Siversky Donets-Donbas canal and managed to cross it in some places?\n\n \n\n>(O): We are not there, but from what I see on the maps \u2013 yes, there is such a situation. But it does not bring them much strategic success; it causes more damage to their infantry.\n\n>Strategically speaking, after the enemy left the Kyiv region, we are winning.\n\n>Their work in the Donetsk direction is not strategically clear to me. It looks more like political bonuses for certain individuals, in particular Prigozhin, who wants to curry favor with Putin. And to show that the PMC unit has a higher efficiency than regular troops. But this is nothing.\n\n>I am sure that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will reset this story very soon.\n\n>(I): Last question: if the Russians push Soledar, how will it affect the defense of Bakhmut, now called the east\u2019s main fortress?\n\n>(O): Tactically \u2013 in no way.

If their full strengths were fighting each other in an optimal environment, the South Korean navy could theoretically have an alright shot at winning.\n\nBut... where would they be fighting, realistically? UK and ROK are on the opposite sides of the world. There is no \"optimal environment\" where both could supply their full strengths at the same time. That's when you start to look into their capability to supply their ships far from home. \n\nAnd lo and behold, the Royal Navy (which needs to defend UK's overseas territories all over the world) operates seven huge resupply ships and several mobile docks to repair their damaged vessels overseas, while ROKN (which only needs to defend its own coast and participate in limited cooperation with its allies) only has four much smaller supply ships and no mobile docks. So if we pick a fight in a random sea far from both countries, UK becomes by far the favorite - it can carry several times more fuel/ammo for its ships and repair them! \n\nBut UK would still certainly fail if it had to fight ROKN on the Korean coast, where the ROKN can repair/supply itself almost limitlessly at the harbors. And will the ROKN have the time to mine the seas in our scenario? They are a very defensively oriented navy, and their mine-laying capacity could well decide the outcome in some cases.\n\nThe second issue, specific to globalfirepower and most similar sites, is just having flawed metrics and often outdated or misleading sources. A Russian MiG-29 in long term storage since 1983 and no pilot should not have the same weight as an operational American F-22 or Chinese J-20 with the latest upgrades and a trained pilot, but it does on their site. And Russia hasn't trained the sorts of integrated air operations that Western countries do, and it has a massive pilot shortage & strained supply situation that only realistically lets it operate a couple hundred fighter jets in a given theater at the same time (compared to the thousands that USA/EU/NATO can and have operated) - so the on-paper numbers do not reflect their actual capability.
