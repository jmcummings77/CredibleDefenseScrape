As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The additional motivation was the rapid increase in the size and diversity of China's nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe language used is pretty stark.\n\n> President Biden approved in March a highly classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States that, for the first time, reorients America\u2019s deterrent strategy to focus on China\u2019s rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal.\n> \n> The shift comes as the Pentagon believes China\u2019s stockpiles will rival the size and diversity of the United States\u2019 and Russia\u2019s over the next decade.\n> \n> The White House never announced that Mr. Biden had approved the revised strategy, called the \u201cNuclear Employment Guidance,\u201d which also newly seeks to prepare the United States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia and North Korea. The document, updated every four years or so, is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of hard copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders.\n> \n> But in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the change \u2014 in carefully constrained, single sentences \u2014 ahead of a more detailed, unclassified notification to Congress expected before Mr. Biden leaves office.\n> \n> \u201cThe president recently issued updated nuclear-weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries,\u201d Vipin Narang, an M.I.T. nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month before returning to academia. \u201cAnd in particular,\u201d he added, the weapons guidance accounted for \u201cthe significant increase in the size and diversity\u201d of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n> \n> **In June, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, Pranay Vaddi, also referred to the document, the first to examine in detail whether the United States is prepared to respond to nuclear crises that break out simultaneously or sequentially, with a combination of nuclear and nonnuclear weapons.**\n> \n> **The new strategy, Mr. Vaddi said, emphasizes \u201cthe need to deter Russia, the PRC and North Korea simultaneously,\u201d using the acronym for the People\u2019s Republic of China.**\n> \n> **In the past, the likelihood that American adversaries could coordinate nuclear threats to outmaneuver the American nuclear arsenal seemed remote. But the emerging partnership between Russia and China, and the conventional arms North Korea and Iran are providing to Russia for the war in Ukraine have fundamentally changed Washington\u2019s thinking.**\n> \n> **Already, Russia and China are conducting military exercises together. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia is aiding the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return.**\n> \n> The new document is a stark reminder that whoever is sworn in next Jan. 20 will confront a changed and far more volatile nuclear landscape than the one that existed just three years ago. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has repeatedly threatened the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine, including during a crisis in October 2022,** when Mr. Biden and his aides, looking at intercepts of conversations between senior Russian commanders, feared the likelihood of nuclear use might rise to 50 percent or even higher.**\n> \n> **Mr. Biden, along with leaders of Germany and Britain, got China and India to make public statements that there was no role for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the crisis abated, at least temporarily.**\n\n\n>** \u201cIt was an important moment,\u201d Richard N. Haass, a former senior State Department and National Security Council official for several Republican presidents, and the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, noted in an interview.** \u201cWe are dealing with a Russia that is radicalized; the idea that nukes wouldn\u2019t be used in a conventional conflict is not longer a safe assumption.\u201d**\n> \n> The second big change arises from China\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The country\u2019s nuclear expansion is running at an even faster pace than American intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping\u2019s determination to scrap the decades-long strategy of maintaining a \u201cminimum deterrent\u201d to reach or exceed the size of Washington\u2019s and Moscow\u2019s arsenals. China\u2019s nuclear complex is now the fastest growing in the world.\n> \n> Although former President Donald J. Trump confidently predicted that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, would surrender his nuclear weapons after their three in-person meetings, the opposite happened. **Mr. Kim has doubled down, and now has more than 60 weapons, officials estimate, and the fuel for many more.**\n> \n> **That expansion has changed the nature of the North Korean challenge: When the country possessed just a handful of weapons, it could be deterred by missile defenses. But its expanded arsenal is fast approaching the size of Pakistan\u2019s and Israel\u2019s, and it is large enough that it could, in theory, coordinate threats with Moscow and Beijing.**\n\n> It was only a matter of time before a fundamentally different nuclear environment began to alter American war plans and strategy, officials say.\n> \n> \u201cIt is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,\u201d Mr. Narang said as he was leaving the Pentagon. **\u201cIt is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the Cold War as nuclear intermission.\u201d**\n> \n> The new challenge is **\u201cthe real possibility of collaboration and even collusion between our nuclear-armed adversaries,\u201d** he said.\n> \n> So far in the presidential campaign, the new challenges to American nuclear strategy have not been a topic of debate. Mr. Biden, who spent much of his political career as an advocate of nuclear nonproliferation, has never publicly talked in any detail about how he is responding to the challenges of deterring China\u2019s and North Korea\u2019s expanded forces. Nor has Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee.\n> \n> At his last news conference in July, just days before he announced he would no longer seek the Democratic nomination for a second term, Mr. Biden acknowledged that he had adopted a policy of seeking ways to interfere in the broader China-Russia partnership.\n> \n> \u201cYes, I do, but I\u2019m not prepared to talk about the detail of it in public,\u201d Mr. Biden said. He made no reference to \u2014 and was not asked about \u2014 how that partnership was altering American nuclear strategy.\n> \n> Since Harry Truman\u2019s presidency, that strategy has been overwhelmingly focused on the Kremlin\u2019s arsenal. Mr. Biden\u2019s new guidance suggests how quickly that is shifting.\n> \n> China was mentioned in the last nuclear guidance, issued at the end of the Trump administration, according to an unclassified account provided to Congress in 2020. But that was before the scope of Mr. Xi\u2019s ambitions were understood.\n> \n>** The Biden strategy sharpens that focus to reflect the Pentagon\u2019s estimates that China\u2019s nuclear force would expand to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, roughly the numbers that the United States and Russia now deploy. In fact, Beijing now appears ahead of that schedule, officials say, and has begun loading nuclear missiles into new silo fields that were spotted by commercial satellites three years ago.**\n> \n> **There is another concern about Beijing: It has now halted a short-lived conversation with the United States about improving nuclear safety and security \u2014 for example, by agreeing to warn each other of impending missile tests, or setting up hotlines or other means of communication to assure that incidents or accidents do not escalate into nuclear encounters.**\n> \n> **One discussion between the two countries took place late last fall, just before Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi met in California, where they sought to repair relations between the two countries. They referred to those talks in a joint statement, but by that time the Chinese had already hinted they were not interested in further discussions, and earlier this summer said the conversations were over. They cited American arms sales to Taiwan, which were underway long before the nuclear safety conversations began.**\n> \n> Mallory Stewart, the assistant secretary for arms control, deterrence and stability at the State Department, said in an interview that the Chinese government was \u201cactively preventing us from having conversations about the risks.\u201d\n> \n> Instead, she said, Beijing \u201cseems to be taking a page out of Russia\u2019s playbook that, until we address tensions and challenges in our bilateral relationship, they will choose not to continue our arms control, risk reduction and nonproliferation conversations.\u201d\n> \n> It was in China\u2019s interest, she argued, \u201cto prevent these risks of miscalculation and misunderstanding.\u201d",

But the emerging partnership between Russia and China, and the conventional arms North Korea and Iran are providing to Russia for the war in Ukraine have fundamentally changed Washington\u2019s thinking.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Already, Russia and China are conducting military exercises together. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia is aiding the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The new document is a stark reminder that whoever is sworn in next Jan. 20 will confront a changed and far more volatile nuclear landscape than the one that existed just three years ago. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has repeatedly threatened the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine, including during a crisis in October 2022,** when Mr. Biden and his aides, looking at intercepts of conversations between senior Russian commanders, feared the likelihood of nuclear use might rise to 50 percent or even higher.**</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mr. Biden, along with leaders of Germany and Britain, got China and India to make public statements that there was no role for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the crisis abated, at least temporarily.</strong></p>\n\n<p>** \u201cIt was an important moment,\u201d Richard N. Haass, a former senior State Department and National Security Council official for several Republican presidents, and the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, noted in an interview.** \u201cWe are dealing with a Russia that is radicalized; the idea that nukes wouldn\u2019t be used in a conventional conflict is not longer a safe assumption.\u201d**</p>\n\n<p>The second big change arises from China\u2019s nuclear ambitions. The country\u2019s nuclear expansion is running at an even faster pace than American intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping\u2019s determination to scrap the decades-long strategy of maintaining a \u201cminimum deterrent\u201d to reach or exceed the size of Washington\u2019s and Moscow\u2019s arsenals. China\u2019s nuclear complex is now the fastest growing in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Although former President Donald J. Trump confidently predicted that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, would surrender his nuclear weapons after their three in-person meetings, the opposite happened. <strong>Mr. Kim has doubled down, and now has more than 60 weapons, officials estimate, and the fuel for many more.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>That expansion has changed the nature of the North Korean challenge: When the country possessed just a handful of weapons, it could be deterred by missile defenses. But its expanded arsenal is fast approaching the size of Pakistan\u2019s and Israel\u2019s, and it is large enough that it could, in theory, coordinate threats with Moscow and Beijing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was only a matter of time before a fundamentally different nuclear environment began to alter American war plans and strategy, officials say.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,\u201d Mr. Narang said as he was leaving the Pentagon. <strong>\u201cIt is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the Cold War as nuclear intermission.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>The new challenge is <strong>\u201cthe real possibility of collaboration and even collusion between our nuclear-armed adversaries,\u201d</strong> he said.</p>\n\n<p>So far in the presidential campaign, the new challenges to American nuclear strategy have not been a topic of debate. Mr. Biden, who spent much of his political career as an advocate of nuclear nonproliferation, has never publicly talked in any detail about how he is responding to the challenges of deterring China\u2019s and North Korea\u2019s expanded forces. Nor has Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee.</p>\n\n<p>At his last news conference in July, just days before he announced he would no longer seek the Democratic nomination for a second term, Mr. Biden acknowledged that he had adopted a policy of seeking ways to interfere in the broader China-Russia partnership.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, I do, but I\u2019m not prepared to talk about the detail of it in public,\u201d Mr. Biden said. He made no reference to \u2014 and was not asked about \u2014 how that partnership was altering American nuclear strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Since Harry Truman\u2019s presidency, that strategy has been overwhelmingly focused on the Kremlin\u2019s arsenal. Mr. Biden\u2019s new guidance suggests how quickly that is shifting.</p>\n\n<p>China was mentioned in the last nuclear guidance, issued at the end of the Trump administration, according to an unclassified account provided to Congress in 2020. But that was before the scope of Mr. Xi\u2019s ambitions were understood.</p>\n\n<p>** The Biden strategy sharpens that focus to reflect the Pentagon\u2019s estimates that China\u2019s nuclear force would expand to 1,000 by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035, roughly the numbers that the United States and Russia now deploy. In fact, Beijing now appears ahead of that schedule, officials say, and has begun loading nuclear missiles into new silo fields that were spotted by commercial satellites three years ago.**</p>\n\n<p><strong>There is another concern about Beijing: It has now halted a short-lived conversation with the United States about improving nuclear safety and security \u2014 for example, by agreeing to warn each other of impending missile tests, or setting up hotlines or other means of communication to assure that incidents or accidents do not escalate into nuclear encounters.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>One discussion between the two countries took place late last fall, just before Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi met in California, where they sought to repair relations between the two countries. They referred to those talks in a joint statement, but by that time the Chinese had already hinted they were not interested in further discussions, and earlier this summer said the conversations were over. They cited American arms sales to Taiwan, which were underway long before the nuclear safety conversations began.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mallory Stewart, the assistant secretary for arms control, deterrence and stability at the State Department, said in an interview that the Chinese government was \u201cactively preventing us from having conversations about the risks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Instead, she said, Beijing \u201cseems to be taking a page out of Russia\u2019s playbook that, until we address tensions and challenges in our bilateral relationship, they will choose not to continue our arms control, risk reduction and nonproliferation conversations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was in China\u2019s interest, she argued, \u201cto prevent these risks of miscalculation and misunderstanding.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The majority of the RAAF and RAN is deployed in the southern part of the country which while adequate for aerial assets can pose problems for submarines which can take upwards of 2 weeks to deploy up north while sailing from Sydney or Perth this unique operational requirement for the capability to rapidly deploy submarines 5000+ kms from friendly bases resulted in at the time of its launch the largest diesel electric submarine ever deployed and to this day it has one of the longest ranges of any conventional submarine\u00a0\n\nThe UN deployment to East Timor which was made up predominantly of Australians was very concerning to the ADF as Washington refused to deploy major naval assets in support leaving the RAN to do most of the heavy lifting this operation which took place in our backyard stretched the RAN\u2019s amphibious capabilities to their breaking point and demonstrated just how much that capability had declined since the retirement of our last 2 aircraft carriers this combined with the Global war on terror which also required considerable naval assets to sustain combat overseas even in low risk environments like Iraq and Afghanistan resulted in the procurement of 2 Canberra class LHD\u00a0\n\nIn 2009 a defence paper was written which outlined the future of the RAN in it was a proposal for a fleet made up of 3 air warfare destroyers plus an option for a fourth and 8 heavy frigates as well as 12 submarines and 20 multipurpose 2000 ton multipurpose ships\u00a0\n\nThe 3 air warfare destroyers became the Hobart class the fourth was canceled which due to the delays of the hunter class resulted in a capability gap that would last nearly a decade\u00a0\n\nThe 8 heavy frigates would become the hunter class which was cut down to 5\u00a0\n\nThe 20 multipurpose ships would be cancelled and replaced by the Arafura class which are a grossly oversized patrol vessel that unlike the initial proposal lacks the capability to integrate containerised modules that allow it do mine warfare hydrographic surveys and limited ASW capabilities\u00a0\n\nThere are several scenarios outlined in the video about a potential war with china and the various ways ADF assets can be used\u00a0\n\nThe first focuses on deterring a Chinese carrier strike group attempting to strike bases in northern Australia with a massed Anti ship missile strike with MST JSM and LRASM launched from aerial and naval assets the strike is conducted in a highly coordinated manner with an MQ 4C providing ISR EA 18G providing offensive jamming to help the final approach of the attacking missiles and JORN helping to direct the missiles this scenario highlights just how capable naval A2AD and the home field advantage can be with a much smaller predominantly Australian force being able to deter an entire Chinese carrier strike group\u00a0\n\n\nThe second scenario focuses on ASW operations while escorting oil tankers between India and Australia in this scenario he points out that the hunter class while extremely potent in ASW is considerably overmatched for escorting ships and would be better used in other higher risk operations he proposes that smaller less capable tier 2 frigates are assigned this role\u00a0\n\nThe final scenario is about a forward deployment of Australian army assets Suku islands in this scenario it\u2019s mainly exploring the role that forward deployed A2AD assets can have which while capable of being bypassed would probably result in considerable attrition and even if a large flotilla can bypass it those assets can still deny smaller less defended auxiliary and supply ships\u00a0\n\nThe final part of the video focuses on the 11 tier 2 frigates the RAN is procuring and the various proposals the 4 main contestants each have their pros and cons\u00a0\n\nThe German submission the Meko A210 is an evolution of the Meko 200 which the original anzac class is based on it has an impressive 32 mk41 cells but that specific proposal has never been built before and the RAN is looking for something they can get as fast as possible\u00a0\n\nThe Japanese Mogami class has 16 Mk41 cells and is in active service but the radar and sensor component and weapons integration could take time that the RAN doesn\u2019t have which is the same\u00a0for the Korean submission except that one has its mk41 cells replayed with the K VLS cells which only take Korean designed missiles\u00a0\n\nThe Spanish Alfa 3000 is a an upscale design based on the Avante corvette which is in service with the Saudi and Venezuelan navies it has 16 mk41 vls cells but is it based on a corvette and could result in limited upgrade potential\u00a0\n\nHe concludes that the most likely pick is the Meko as the 32 cell vls count would enormously benefit the the RAN the video than moves onto the optionally manned ships which are most likely going to be minimally manned instead of autonomous most of the time due to maintenance and ethical concerns the video notes that there really isn\u2019t much concrete information about what kind of ships these could be but speculates that it would primarily serve to boost VLS counts for manned ships and undertake riskier operations\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot of stuff about AUKUS but the main takeaway is that Australia is most likely to build 7+ submarines as that amount would allow for continuous submarine production lines also lots of stuff about how much better SSN\u2019s are than diesel electric are but that\u2019s to be expected\u00a0",

To offset this with a technological boondoggle of an undesigned semi drone ship class that in all likelihood will never be built or procured simply leaves one without polite words.\n\nIn the Australian Army under Plan Beersheba it was at least recognised that force design needed to account for two key principles of continual training, readiness and deployment cycles that ensure quality unit formation, together with the integration of these units within essentially a ratio system between the constituent forces (such as one permanent battalion of mechanised infantry and supporting elements being paired with two reserve battalion as light infantry who then progress in tandem through each stage of the cycle and can be mobilised together). \n\nYet these principles of force design, the ratios between forces which then facilitates cycles of rest, readiness and training, and allows for the massing of forces simply appears to have never entered into the heads of our naval planners. Whatever number of assets is believed to be sufficient to deal with a threat, that number should be tripled in order to facilitate a sustainable force structure and maintenance, or quadrupled in consideration of attrition and massing. The increased numbers further preserves and disperses institutional knowledge and experience across a deeper bench of officers and NCOs and supports the perennially anaemic economic viability of shipbuilding and yards for repair. Not to mention that this inadequate force structure is divided into two halves of a continent separated by 3000km simply begging for defeat in detail. The Canberra LHDs and the lack of escorting destroyers and frigates is the case in point of seeking a capability without undertaking the necessary preparations and investments to actually effect that capability on a reliable basis.\n\nRAN and RAAF\u2019s lack of seriousness on this issue drives me insane.",

To offset this with a technological boondoggle of an undesigned semi drone ship class that in all likelihood will never be built or procured simply leaves one without polite words.</p>\n\n<p>In the Australian Army under Plan Beersheba it was at least recognised that force design needed to account for two key principles of continual training, readiness and deployment cycles that ensure quality unit formation, together with the integration of these units within essentially a ratio system between the constituent forces (such as one permanent battalion of mechanised infantry and supporting elements being paired with two reserve battalion as light infantry who then progress in tandem through each stage of the cycle and can be mobilised together). </p>\n\n<p>Yet these principles of force design, the ratios between forces which then facilitates cycles of rest, readiness and training, and allows for the massing of forces simply appears to have never entered into the heads of our naval planners. Whatever number of assets is believed to be sufficient to deal with a threat, that number should be tripled in order to facilitate a sustainable force structure and maintenance, or quadrupled in consideration of attrition and massing. The increased numbers further preserves and disperses institutional knowledge and experience across a deeper bench of officers and NCOs and supports the perennially anaemic economic viability of shipbuilding and yards for repair. Not to mention that this inadequate force structure is divided into two halves of a continent separated by 3000km simply begging for defeat in detail.

Indeed, they&#39;d play a very minimal role in this campaign if conventional air power weren&#39;t largely neutralized; for instance, if NATO were to suddenly show up to the party (with much greater ability to neutralize/evade Russian AA), drones would fade importance next to bombers and attack aircraft (which could put much more ordnance on target much more quickly).  Dropping grenades on people from RC aircraft is something you do when you&#39;re desperate and out of better options.  It&#39;s not a go-to for victory in the general case.</p>\n</div>",

Afterall the photo you take from the drone is going to be from an \u201codd\u201d angle so they\u2019re going to need at least 3 to be able to rotate the stored images in 3D to the angle of the taken shot, estimate the face from that angle and then match. Usually when they capture an item in 3D they take hundreds from all angles, but I\u2019m guessing 3 is the absolute bare minimum. Afterall your drone is unlikely to be able to take a full face straight-on headshot for matching, if it did it\u2019d be spotted as the target would be looking directly at it.\n\nEdit: Thinking some more\u2026 Given they\u2019re highly likely to be taking the \u201cshot to be matched\u201d from an angle high above the target you might also want a 4th from a higher angle too to make the match easier/more reliable when rotated in the vertical dimension as well.\n\nSoftware is good at interpolating what something should look like when it\u2019s interpolating between two angles. Say one taken at 0 degrees and one taken at 90 degrees\u2026 if the shot to be matched is at (say) 30 degrees. It\u2019s NOT good at doing so if it doesn\u2019t have an image to estimate from further round that rotation. So for a shot taken at (say) -30 horizontal and + 45 vertical it\u2019s going to want one at 0,0 one at -90,0 and one at 0, 90 then it can use those three images to estimate the -30,45 image. Without the -90 horizontal and 90 vertical it\u2019s got nothing to adjust the 0,0 image too. How long is the nose? Is that dot on the left cheek from a frontal shot a small \u201cpock\u201d scar ? Or a line scare that extends along the cheek? Is that hairline on the 0,0 shot the front of a full head of hair ? Or a little \u201cdab\u201d of hair at the front that covers balding behind in the 0,0 shot (that you\u2019d see clearly in the 0,90 shot) ? Apart from anything else it\u2019s going to want good shots of the ears as they\u2019re very useful for computerised matching Etc etc.",
                                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Just from the fact that an average jpeg type image is about 6MB and assuming you\u2019d want at least 3, a full-on, one side and the other to be able to match from any angle. Afterall the photo you take from the drone is going to be from an \u201codd\u201d angle so they\u2019re going to need at least 3 to be able to rotate the stored images in 3D to the angle of the taken shot, estimate the face from that angle and then match. Usually when they capture an item in 3D they take hundreds from all angles, but I\u2019m guessing 3 is the absolute bare minimum. Afterall your drone is unlikely to be able to take a full face straight-on headshot for matching, if it did it\u2019d be spotted as the target would be looking directly at it.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thinking some more\u2026 Given they\u2019re highly likely to be taking the \u201cshot to be matched\u201d from an angle high above the target you might also want a 4th from a higher angle too to make the match easier/more reliable when rotated in the vertical dimension as well.</p>\n\n<p>Software is good at interpolating what something should look like when it\u2019s interpolating between two angles. Say one taken at 0 degrees and one taken at 90 degrees\u2026 if the shot to be matched is at (say) 30 degrees. It\u2019s NOT good at doing so if it doesn\u2019t have an image to estimate from further round that rotation. So for a shot taken at (say) -30 horizontal and + 45 vertical it\u2019s going to want one at 0,0 one at -90,0 and one at 0, 90 then it can use those three images to estimate the -30,45 image. Without the -90 horizontal and 90 vertical it\u2019s got nothing to adjust the 0,0 image too. How long is the nose? Is that dot on the left cheek from a frontal shot a small \u201cpock\u201d scar ? Or a line scare that extends along the cheek? Is that hairline on the 0,0 shot the front of a full head of hair ? Or a little \u201cdab\u201d of hair at the front that covers balding behind in the 0,0 shot (that you\u2019d see clearly in the 0,90 shot) ? Apart from anything else it\u2019s going to want good shots of the ears as they\u2019re very useful for computerised matching Etc etc.</p>\n</div>",

This count includes a tally of every missile type and appears to divide this number up by specifying 6,291 of missile types which are 'difficult'^? to intercept (image translators has issues due to image quality). It also includes a separate count of 13,997 UAVs launched including Shaheds and Lancets with 9,272 shot down (66% rate). \n\nThis is the first time such a comprehensive list has been released as far as I am aware. So... is it accurate? There is no objective means to prove this, but the we can check for consistency with a comprehensive list regularly updated on [Ukrainian Wikipedia](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%BA_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%85_%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D1%96%D0%B4_%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81_%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%96%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F) which attempts to compile all media reports of missiles and is limited (in the same way that other visual/media confirmed counts are lacking). So I took the time to tally the results of this Wikipedia page to see how these results compare. This results in a total count (including S-300/C-400) of 2,415 intercepted out of 5,834 which equals a rate of 41%. Higher than Syrski's figure, but the Wikipedia total is just 60% of the new Ukrainian reported total. \n\nBut why is there any difference between the numbers? These are both based Ukrainian reports, so shouldn't they match up? One reason for this difference is that it was estimated that [1,100 missiles were launched at Ukraine in the first month](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2973395/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing/) of the war. Meanwhile, the Wikipedia page counts just *300* during this time period as media reports were unable to record everything happening during this chaotic first days of the war. This time period had an interception rate of only **7%** which indicates a lower true shoot down rate. Another factor is the S-300 - these were first repurposed for ground attacks during Summer 2022 and have been very difficult to intercept ever since. The Wikipedia page separately counts these (combined in my above count) at 1,199 **hits** of 1,216 total - an interception rate of 1.3%. This Wikipedia count is 1,800 less than the 3,000 that Syrski reports - including this to the Wikipedia tally decreases the total interception rate by 10% alone. These factors together make up almost all the difference.\n\nSo this new data seems be in agreement with previous media reports, and doesn't seem to otherwise portray a fantasy scenario either. This doesn't mean a high interception rate being reported is false. When Russia tries to attack the most secure part of Ukraine (Kyiv), that will happen. There is just a whole lot more happening in other parts of Ukraine that people don't care about or that doesn't get reported on much. I don't think lying about the numbers matters all that much for morale at this point, and there's [no way to hide strikes in the middle of Kyiv](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1dy3wx1/russian_strikes_on_kyiv/) anyway.",

We have seen examples of IIRC debris of Kh-101 missiles, which for one are far less numerous, being fitted with either a larger warhead or extra guidance modules. But out of all 3,008 S-300 launches I haven't seen any debris with any modifications.\n\nThe original S-300 system uses TVM guidance which in short means that the missile itself lacks the ability to calculate how to hit the target, all processing is done by the ground station through comparing the location of the missile and the target. Instructions are formed and sent to the missile. This is a different process to both active guidance on the missile or classic SARH tracking where a constant illumination radar mode is used and the missile does the calculating. The benefit is both, simpler electronics on the missile and no obvious warning for aircraft that they are being locked. \n\nWith this then, I don't understand how that system could be repurposed for something as far outside of it's intended use case as ground attack: the radar obviously has no way of seeing the target, the missile is designed to be dumb and inexpensive meaning a large overhaul would be needed.\n\nIt is late as I am writing this so I hope someone corrects me but after a quick search there is also very little analysis about this system to be found anywhere. This is very strange as it is reported to be responsible for almost 33% of the total missile launches by Russia throughout the entire war, 3,008 out of 9,627. Also the number shot down seems absurdly low at 19. I will grant that the number includes S-400 missiles in an unspecified role but lets say only 2/3 are S-300, that is still an awful lot.

            "body": "The F-16s, at least at the moment, are not being used to engage Russian combat aircraft. This is for a few reasons (and a decent amount of speculation on my part, given the opacity of the situation right now); \n\n1\u2022Quantity. Ukraine has only been visually confirmed to have up to 10 Dutch F-16s transferred as of writing this. This has some pretty big implications for how the Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) can operate them. \n\nThe biggest implication, and an issue inherent in operating any aircraft, is maintenance and readiness. Aircraft need a certain amount of hours of maintenance per flight hour: in the case of the F-16, that about 16 man-hours of maintenance on average per flight hour. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that those F-16s will be grounded for 16 hours for every flight, but instead that a crew of 16 men will have to spend an hour doing maintenance for every hour that F-16 was in the air. The jet can build up those hours to decrease time between sorties, but that builds up the time needed for maintenance. For the Ukrainians, in the tense operating environment they\u2019re in, that latter possibility is most likely. \n\nSo what does that mean? That means that out of those 10 F-16s, at least a portion will need to be undergoing relatively long-term maintenance so that it can replace another F-16 doing back-to-back sorties. *That* F-16 that is replaced can then cycle into maintenance, and so on. Effectively, that cuts the amount of F-16s available down by at least 2 or 3 at any given time. \n\n2\u2022Pilot Training. Ukraine has been bottlenecked by foreign pilot training; only a handful of Ukrainian pilots have been able to train abroad at any given time. 12 in Arizona for a few-months stint, 26 in France for a six-months program, about a dozen in the UK for a similarly long course. \n\nJust as there\u2019s the shadow of maintenance requirements on combat jets, there\u2019s also the shadow of personnel. You need a *lot* of pilots for just *one* aircraft. \n\nJust based on human needs you already need at least 2 pilots-per-aircraft if you want round the clock coverage. One pilot needs to sleep, eat, rest while another can fly. But really, you get burnout very quickly if you\u2019re only swapping between two pilots on shifts; in reality you might need four or five pilots per aircraft. \n\nThen there\u2019s contingencies: pilots get sick, they need to spend time with their families, they might even get in trouble with the law on their time off. You need people in reserve to replace them when these things happen. That bumps the number way up, you might need as many as seven or eight pilots trained on the F-16 for every F-16 you fly. \n\nSo that long winded explanation aside, that means a couple of those F-16s are going to have to be relegated to transitionary training. Pilots already trained on the dwindling numbers of MiG-29s and Su-27 are going to need in-cockpit experience in the F-16. The sooner pilots begin to transition to this new platform, the more pilots you have to man the next batch of F-16s that arrive in the country. \n\n3\u2022Disincentives (this one will be long). The Russian Armed Forces are not stupid. They were not designing their own equipment with Soviet-era equipment in mind; they were designing it to mitigate *Western* advantages. Russian equipment makes the operating environment over Ukraine and Russia very harsh, and creates a very one-sided dilemma for the UAF. \n\nLet\u2019s start with examining *what* is lobbing these glide bombs: the Su-34 Fullback. \n\nThe Fullback is relatively fast (about 100mp/h slower than the F-16 fully loaded), has decent range, and most importantly mounts electronic countermeasures on almost every mission. \n\nThe Khibiny ECM pod that the Fullback mounts, while somewhat dated, is still a potent hazard. Without getting into the specifics of how it works, the pod makes determining the Su-34s speed, heading, and position much more difficult for radar operators. The further away the radar is, the more this jamming is effective. \n\nThis means the F-16s will have to make the choice of either avoiding the Su-34 altogether, or attempting to close the gap with an aircraft that is only slightly slower, has superior range, and which mounts air to air missiles for self-defense. \n\nWhat about the glide bombs themselves? The UMPK glide bomb kits these aircraft are slinging have, according to TASS and corroborated by the UAF, a max range of about 60km (37 miles). As far as I am aware, these Su-34s are slinging these UMPK-modified bombs from at or near that max range, and then breaking for home to avoid Ukrainian air defenses. \n\nThat means these aircraft are flying well within the protection of Russian air defense systems. \n\nBeyond all of this, the electronic environment over Ukraine and Russia is a horrendous environment to operate. Krasukha radar jamming systems makes the radar conditions near high-value zones extremely difficult to operate in, and GPS jamming from various systems disrupts the GPS and communications networks that these F-16s would rely on. \n\nAll in all, putting those F-16s up in the current conditions over the front would more than likely produce dire outcomes. The Russians have very effectively made the prospect of interception very high risk-relatively low reward. \n\n4\u2022Weapons. This is my final point, and partially speculative on my part. \n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Ukraine really has weapons capable of *reaching* those aircraft in the first place. We have only seen the UAF F-16s carrying AIM-9M/Ls and CATM-120Bs (the latter a training aid). \n\nWhile they\u2019ve certainly *had* AIM-120s to use with NASAMS, it\u2019s not certain that they have, or will have in the near future, AIM-120Ds capable of reaching up to 100 miles out (160km). With only AIM-120B/Cs, the UAF are limited to 31 miles (50km). That\u2019s simply not enough to hit these Su-34s, given that 60km range on the UMPK. \n\nI hope that helps. I tried to get this out relatively quickly so I haven\u2019t attached sources for my claims, but I\u2019d be happy to do so, or to clarify anything if you need/want me to.",

This is my take: \n\n   Ukraine has to work *around* the glide bombs, not *through* them. What do I mean by this? \n\nWell, let\u2019s start with what working *through* them entails; *this* would be trying to counter them directly at the source. Stuff like high-risk interception by F-16s, procuring a system like C-RAM, or pushing NASAMS and Patriot up to the front to attempt to down the aircraft carrying the UMPK kits. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t have to point out that none of these options seem all that appealing; high-risk interceptions are,well, high-risk. The F-16s are nigh irreplaceable, every loss presents a decrease in capability. C-RAM and related systems seem very unlikely to be on the docket for foreign lawmakers, they\u2019re extremely expensive to operate, and only cover a very limited area. Risking NASAMS or Patriot presents an even higher risk to those systems compared to using the F-16 due to the almost-stationary nature of those systems (compared to a jet going over the speed of sound, of course). \n\n   So what is *working around* them? That\u2019s just making the lives of the VKS pilots, maintainers and logistics personnel more difficult to make launching these glide bombs an increasingly more annoying prospect. \n\nWhat that means in practice is largely what we\u2019ve seen Ukraine do; \n\n\u2022hitting airbases with drone and missile strikes, thereby eliminating the FAB bombs these UMPK kits rely on, as well as the fuel stores the Su-34s need to fly. \n\n\u2022It means using maneuver warfare (where applicable, such as the Kursk and Kharkiv directions) to make it more difficult to target Ukrainian forces effectively. \n\n\u2022It means hitting airborne and ground-based control centers, as we\u2019ve seen with the successful downing of A-50s and an Il-22. This makes the target acquisition and guidance for these Su-34s that much more difficult, and more reliant on the skills of individual pilots which can vary. \n\n\u2022Finally, it means making the fuel logistics situation more tense. Hitting oil refineries and reserves deep in Russian territory has an obvious *economic* impact, but it also means that the logistics supply chain for fuel will have to be altered every time a node in that chain is severed. This may not directly affect the airbases or aircraft, but it can affect the trucks which bring fuel, supplies and personnel to the base. \n \n    Really though, there isn\u2019t much else to be done in my opinion. The glide bombs are simply an extension and advancement of old school gravity munitions, much the same way that the Paveway and other PGMs are. \n\nI think the closest comparison would be to ask if the North Vietnamese could ever counter F-105s and B-52s dropping dumb bombs over Haiphong. They can do their damndest to make the proposition worse (with air defense, interceptors, spreading out their arms/fuel/etc stockpiles) but a determined opponent will still try to find a silver lining, and ultimately continue their operations.",

You seem to have \"cherry picked\" this 200:1 number without thinking about industrial capacity or economics. The US has lost some industrial capacity at the expense of China it is true but when it comes to naval combat ships specifically the US is still quite the power house.\n\nIn terms of nuclear powered aircraft carriers there are only two proven modern facilities in the world, the US (Virginia) and France (Saint-Nazaire), the Korean and Japanese industries probably could do it within a decade with the right investment and of course the Chinese are building up to it but there's really no contest right now or in the near future. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv2C6EZW3Oc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv2C6EZW3Oc)\n\nIn terms of submarines the US again dominates though the gaps are smaller. The US is currently producing approximately one nuclear powered submarine per year and industrially and that is most likely to continue for many years. While the Chinese are building faster, they're at least 20 years behind technologically.\n\n1.4 billion is now widely seen as an overestimate here's a probable underestimate for comparison.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPrWm6fWuaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPrWm6fWuaM)\n\nOkay so lets try to find a historical comparison. The world is probably mid transition from the US being the dominate player in a \"single-pole\" world into it being the single strongest player in a \"multi-pole\" world. The single strongest military force on the planet right now is NATO, with the US representing roughly half of NATO's combat power. We could split that and consider both the US, and EU, great powers alongside China. The largest contender is probably India but there are a number of smaller aspirational powers, and a declining Russia which is in the process of losing its great power status. This to me looks more like the setup for WWI than WWII. At the time Germany had just become a great power, certainly the strongest land power having just defeated France the former strongest land power. Its debatable whether they were stronger than the British Empire overall. So China maybe slots into Germany's WWI position, and Russia into the Ottoman Empire's. Its not a perfect analogy and importantly the strategic planners in the US, China, and other nations know about these risks and are trying to avoid the same tragedy.  \n\\[edit\\] I had intended to suggest that the US would slot into the UK's role in WWI, with EU as France.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This premise is a little nutty because not all ship building is equal. You seem to have &quot;cherry picked&quot; this 200:1 number without thinking about industrial capacity or economics. The US has lost some industrial capacity at the expense of China it is true but when it comes to naval combat ships specifically the US is still quite the power house.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of nuclear powered aircraft carriers there are only two proven modern facilities in the world, the US (Virginia) and France (Saint-Nazaire), the Korean and Japanese industries probably could do it within a decade with the right investment and of course the Chinese are building up to it but there&#39;s really no contest right now or in the near future. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv2C6EZW3Oc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv2C6EZW3Oc</a></p>\n\n<p>In terms of submarines the US again dominates though the gaps are smaller.

I&#39;d also push to degrade the US political process to get a premier in who is apathetic to the Taiwan conflict or who could be bought off, then with a muted US response guarunteed, rig an election or perform a coup to get my cronies into political power in a plausibly deniable way, and then slowly replace independents in important positions with PRC loyalists or people I&#39;ve bought off, slowly bring PRC propaganda into schools and government messaging (it will work on some people, it will scare others into submission), bring closer ties between PRC and Taiwan, including joint military exercises and hosting PRC military on the island, then I&#39;ll have de facto control of the situation and can wrap up the US/Taiwan relationship at my leisure. Should be doable within 4 years if I get the US president that I want.</p>\n</div>",
