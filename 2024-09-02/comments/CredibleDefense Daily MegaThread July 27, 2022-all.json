What many people here appear to neglect is the fact that the bridge need not be destroyed, just structurally compromised enough to hinder heavy equipment from crossing. And given that the bridge sits well within Ukrainian artillery range, I doubt that any hasty repairs, even if they were possible (which they are very likely not) would go about without continued shelling undoing such efforts very swiftly. The same goes for pontoon bridges or river ferries in the area.   \n\n\nEven diverting supplies to cross the Kakhova dam creates a number of issues. Increasing the absolute distance logistics have to overcome is problematic in of itself, next to forcing the Russians into guarding their convois travelling up and down the P47 road and M14 highway. It seems like time is working against the Russian BTGs on the Western bank of the Dnipro. I'm curious to see how well Ukraine will be able to exploit their pounding of Russian logistics in their eventual siege or offensive.",

Even with very good drones and ATGMs everywhere, the tank is still unmatched as an offensive tool. Drones don't change the fact that a tank is your best bet for getting across open ground without being mown down by small arms fire, and bringing HE direct fire to the things you want to hit with it.\n\nMaybe the way in which tanks are designed and used will change (e.g. I could see AT weapons getting so good that designers stop trying to defeat them with armour/active-protection and instead focus on lighter, faster tanks that are cheaper to field in numbers and can avoid being hit in the first place). Maybe it will become even more important to secure control of the skies before staging any serious offensive. But I think the tank is irreplaceable as the spearhead of that offensive.",

They used tactics of artillery strikes against anywhere they thought Ukraine soldiers were operating. It seems like Russia has a very sophisticated Artillery corp that knows how to deploy the weapons.\n* Artillery was largely used indiscriminately. Not on specific targets, but on entire villages. \n* Dakota and his small squad of about 5 soldiers were personally responsible for probably 50-100 Russian casualties.

The missile strike happens and he is unscathed but gets blown off his bed.\n\nThat\u2019s all it took for him to flee across the border back to Poland then immediately do an AMA, where he goes from most loyal Ukraine supporter to immediately smearing everyone as incompetent but himself.\n\nHe claims that \u201c Ukrainian commanders are crazy they wanted us to fight in Kyiv\u201d\n\n\u201c I had my head on straight so I left, the others that stayed are crazy they\u2019re going to die!\u201d\n\n\u201c I didn\u2019t expect missile or air strikes I just wanted to ambush tanks\u201d\n\n( the moron seriously thought going up against a tank with thermals with a javelin is somehow totally risk free)\n\nYou see those guys every conflict same with Syria, they just want to be war heroes, they never stay long but just turn up run from the fight and to save face because they can\u2019t stay out of the limelight they come back for more attention but claim\u201d ok I was basking in bravery for running there, but now praise me for being smart and running away so fast\u201d\n\nThey always eventually claim the actual veterans or fighters who stayed must be crazy to deflect from their cowardice.\n\nIt\u2019s sad but when it happened people upvoted the guy heavily and took it as gospel, I mean the superior western volunteer must totally be talking sense about those incompetent Ukrainians.\n\nThat\u2019s why I find it funny seeing Dakotas story, he stayed and had the skills and experience and you can tell he knew what he was doing.\n\nHe even talks about people he saw that ran from the field and had to be kicked out. It\u2019s those exact kind of people.\n\nYou can totally understand why the sergeant he met was angry at the volunteers having so much expensive gear and the fact they did more screening. They meet a lot of idiots and time wasters and people that just come to get some media fame and then leave.\n\nCase in point is that Wali guy, he loves the media image of \u201cworld famous sniper\u201d yet he didn\u2019t have such a record in the military. As soon as he went to Ukraine and announced it to media fanfare I knew he\u2019d be leaving in weeks and then spitefully criticising the Ukrainians.\n\n\nAs a former Canadian army corporal he must be so above veterans that fought for almost a decade!\n\nOf course as soon as he got enough media limelight he left and couldn\u2019t say \u201cgood luck them I don\u2019t want to risk my life anymore\u201d instead he of course tells a story about how stupid Ukrainians didn\u2019t listen to his orders and died. And how of course he would stay but he has to leave because of his baby daughter which was always a factor, anything but admit that \u201cworld famous sniper left the battle he acted committed to after just a few weeks\u201d.\n\nAnd of course the guy is already selling a book\u2026\n\nI seriously hope there is a documentary after this war about all the unsavoury publicity seekers and shady fantasists that rush to get the spotlight when these \u201cjust cause\u201d type wars happen.\n\nThey always take up the spotlight but you will never hear of the committed people that actually stayed and made a difference like Dakota because the media has lost their attention by then.",

The missile strike happens and he is unscathed but gets blown off his bed.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s all it took for him to flee across the border back to Poland then immediately do an AMA, where he goes from most loyal Ukraine supporter to immediately smearing everyone as incompetent but himself.</p>\n\n<p>He claims that \u201c Ukrainian commanders are crazy they wanted us to fight in Kyiv\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c I had my head on straight so I left, the others that stayed are crazy they\u2019re going to die!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c I didn\u2019t expect missile or air strikes I just wanted to ambush tanks\u201d</p>\n\n<p>( the moron seriously thought going up against a tank with thermals with a javelin is somehow totally risk free)</p>\n\n<p>You see those guys every conflict same with Syria, they just want to be war heroes, they never stay long but just turn up run from the fight and to save face because they can\u2019t stay out of the limelight they come back for more attention but claim\u201d ok I was basking in bravery for running there, but now praise me for being smart and running away so fast\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They always eventually claim the actual veterans or fighters who stayed must be crazy to deflect from their cowardice.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s sad but when it happened people upvoted the guy heavily and took it as gospel, I mean the superior western volunteer must totally be talking sense about those incompetent Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s why I find it funny seeing Dakotas story, he stayed and had the skills and experience and you can tell he knew what he was doing.</p>\n\n<p>He even talks about people he saw that ran from the field and had to be kicked out. It\u2019s those exact kind of people.</p>\n\n<p>You can totally understand why the sergeant he met was angry at the volunteers having so much expensive gear and the fact they did more screening. They meet a lot of idiots and time wasters and people that just come to get some media fame and then leave.</p>\n\n<p>Case in point is that Wali guy, he loves the media image of \u201cworld famous sniper\u201d yet he didn\u2019t have such a record in the military. As soon as he went to Ukraine and announced it to media fanfare I knew he\u2019d be leaving in weeks and then spitefully criticising the Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<p>As a former Canadian army corporal he must be so above veterans that fought for almost a decade!</p>\n\n<p>Of course as soon as he got enough media limelight he left and couldn\u2019t say \u201cgood luck them I don\u2019t want to risk my life anymore\u201d instead he of course tells a story about how stupid Ukrainians didn\u2019t listen to his orders and died. And how of course he would stay but he has to leave because of his baby daughter which was always a factor, anything but admit that \u201cworld famous sniper left the battle he acted committed to after just a few weeks\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>And of course the guy is already selling a book\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I seriously hope there is a documentary after this war about all the unsavoury publicity seekers and shady fantasists that rush to get the spotlight when these \u201cjust cause\u201d type wars happen.</p>\n\n<p>They always take up the spotlight but you will never hear of the committed people that actually stayed and made a difference like Dakota because the media has lost their attention by then.</p>\n</div>",

That limits options to assaulting the rural areas of bridgehead and largely bypassing the city itself (or as much as possible). Or using other means to cause the Russians to retreat before that is even necessary. Which is likely why they disabled the Antonovsky Bridge, to try to pressure a Russian withdrawal, trying to get the Russians to realize holding the bridgehead is extremely difficult if they can't use those bridges for anything besides foot traffic, so best avoid a battle altogether.\n\nBut there are holes in that operational plan. What if the Russians don't go along with it? \n\nIf Putin decides to hold Kherson like Zelensky wanted to hold Severodonetsk (nearly identical situations), Russia gets fucked. But if he's flexible (as he has been in this war) and accepts losing the bridgehead is a foregone military conclusion if the UAF makes it their strategic main effort (totally true), then evacuation before a large and bloody battle is the wrong option. Their best option is to stay, fight, and try to bleed the UAF to turn the loss of the Kherson bridgehead into a Pyrrhic victory for UA, to damage them as much as possible, to hurt their morale, to make them doubt their abilities to counterattack in the future, and to show the West what it means too (which already seems to be a big part of Russian strategy, the willpower of the West is far more delicate than UA, but even more important). \n\nAlso, as important as the Antonovsky Bridge and the rail bridge are for Russian troops inside the city itself, they're not the only bridges in the Russian bridgehead. A bit upstream and still under Russian control on both sides is the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant bridge. I'm no engineer but I'm guessing that if the UAF hit that with HIMARS enough to render it impassable to vehicle traffic that can cause flooding and power issues. Also, as of today the Russians are supposedly already moving a pontoon bridge across the Dnieper, which means they've prepared contingency plans for this. \n\nSurvival of crossing points will obviously be a big factor in the near future but it's doubtful that it'll be a major cause of Russian defeat. They have too many options. The best way to eliminate those options is by threatening the eastern bank of the Dnieper, which means the Russians will have no place to cross over to get to safety. And that means clearing Kherson oblast from west and east concurrently, which means an assault from the Zaporizhzhia area must start soon that not only works in conjunction to chear Kherson oblast but also cuts the Land Bridge. \n\nWhich is likely what is in the works. Zelensky et al have been talking about a counteroffensive to liberate everything in the south. Even Jomini of the West is reporting a large buildup of UAF forces in that area that likely signals a coming counteroffensive. If they can break through the Konka river defenses there, turn west, it'll turn this counteroffensive into a big encirclement operation, causing all Russian forces to either be cut off or retreat to Crimea.",

How digged in the units on both sides are? How much tactical manouvering occurs? It's hard to know imo. It wouldn't surprise me that the control over many of the villages there was switched many times.\n\nIn any case I have high hopes the push will come from the northeast and along the east bank of Ingulets river, forcing Russians on the retreat. Eventually that might threaten Kherson city to be encircled by breaking connection to Nova Kahkovka dam bridge (since Antonovsky bridge will likely become unoperable).\n\nI think frontal attack anywhere west of Ingulets is very risky and dangerous for the Ukrainians.",

When I see the frontline in the Donbass i kinda know the line is mostly solid, especially along Siversky Donets river, and older fortified lines near Donetsk city etc. Here, I am not so sure. How digged in the units on both sides are? How much tactical manouvering occurs? It&#39;s hard to know imo. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me that the control over many of the villages there was switched many times.</p>\n\n<p>In any case I have high hopes the push will come from the northeast and along the east bank of Ingulets river, forcing Russians on the retreat. Eventually that might threaten Kherson city to be encircled by breaking connection to Nova Kahkovka dam bridge (since Antonovsky bridge will likely become unoperable).</p>\n\n<p>I think frontal attack anywhere west of Ingulets is very risky and dangerous for the Ukrainians.</p>\n</div>",
