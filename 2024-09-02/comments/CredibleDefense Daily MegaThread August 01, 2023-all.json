He tries ti get money from russia and China (and from every one to be honest, just this week, we lost our rights to travel to the US without a visa, cause we literally sold hungarian aka EU citizenships to 10s of thousands of people without any vetting).\n\nHe doesnt make himself less popular, Budapest hates him. The rest of the country pretty much only has access to his propaganda. He gave th hungarians in Romania right to vote, started to spend generously on them and secured their votes (without hungary getting any tax or etc. I got the spirit of it, but I also see the whys and its ... yeah)\n\nSo with controlling what 70-75% of the people hear. While also having thanks to this and other factors a reliable base (20-25%) that is fanatical (restore the old hungarian borders etc). He literally cannot be removed by democratic means.\n\nHungary is what I describe as a \"soft dictatorship\". I would say Belarus, russia, are something like that, but because they literally kill their opposition, I would still give then the \"hard dictatorship\" description. Here, you don't get killed. You get bombarded by megative press, often lies and the judges just dont do anything, or maybe order the medias to correct themselves 3 years later, with an article that is up on the webpage for 2 days (yeah ...). The tax office will take your company on made up charges, you are billed extra etc. Policy ignores you when unknown individuals start to damage your stuff and so on and on.\n\nThis is how you run a dictatorship while being part of the west.\n\nThis is a book from 2014, I think there is a 2. publication now that cathes up on the \"since then\" \n\nLink - https://budapestbeacon.com/hungarian-octopus-post-communist-mafia-state/amp/\n\nI am saying this again and again, because back in the 90s, Westerners didnt comprehend the situation in the ex soviet bloc countries. Luckily while most of them seems to be growing out of that reality and are now able to start catching up, hungary \"choose\" a different path. It is important to understand that you are dealing with a dictatorship clothed in a democracy when you talk about hungary. If you dont believe me, I am ready to bet 10k + USD right now on the \"who wins the next election\". Because if the current war, even in higher confidence then with putin. (Still, we all know that he wont be removed by democratic means neither)",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Orban&#39;s entire narrative is built on the evil shadow goverment coming to get you and he is the only one that can protect Hungary.</p>\n\n<p>He sees that he cannot build his kingdom and declare himself king in the EU, he can not give up power as the amount of money he stole and laws he broke could catch up.</p>\n\n<p>This means that he blasts anti EU and pro russian propaganda. He tries ti get money from russia and China (and from every one to be honest, just this week, we lost our rights to travel to the US without a visa, cause we literally sold hungarian aka EU citizenships to 10s of thousands of people without any vetting).</p>\n\n<p>He doesnt make himself less popular, Budapest hates him. The rest of the country pretty much only has access to his propaganda. He gave th hungarians in Romania right to vote, started to spend generously on them and secured their votes (without hungary getting any tax or etc. I got the spirit of it, but I also see the whys and its ... yeah)</p>\n\n<p>So with controlling what 70-75% of the people hear. While also having thanks to this and other factors a reliable base (20-25%) that is fanatical (restore the old hungarian borders etc). He literally cannot be removed by democratic means.</p>\n\n<p>Hungary is what I describe as a &quot;soft dictatorship&quot;.

[Kenya has stepped forward with an offer to lead the response with 1,000 police officers.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/world/americas/haiti-international-intervention.html)\n\n>On Saturday, Kenya said in a statement that it would \u201cpositively consider\u201d leading such a force by sending 1,000 police officers to the Caribbean nation, which has become a cauldron of violence and political instability.\n\n>...\n\n>Kenya\u2019s foreign minister, Alfred N.

Jacqueline, why has the offer come from Kenya and not Haiti's neighbors, like the U.S., maybe, for example?\n\n>JACQUELINE CHARLES: Well, the U.S. has said that they do not want to lead a force, even though they support this. They have written a resolution that's been before the U.N. Security Council now for about nine months. The U.S. had been hoping that Canada would step up and lead. And though Canada hasn't publicly said no, they also haven't raised their hands. So it's been nine months since the Haitian government requested international help, a specialized force to come in and to help the Haitian National Police. We've seen Jamaica said that they're willing to help field some sort of multinational force. But again, up until now, no one has said that, yes, we will lead it. So this development with Kenya comes after months of discussions and debates at the U.N and Kenya also saying that, you know, African nations should take more of a leadership role in helping Haiti address this security humanitarian crisis.\n\n>MART\u00cdNEZ: What about the country of Haiti?

But when you talk to the average Haitian, they just want help. They recognize that in the country of 12 million people with only 3,500 police officers on the streets throughout the country on any given day, that that's just not going to cut it...So people basically feel a sense of desperation and really in need of help. And at this point, let it come from where it can come from.\n\n>MART\u00cdNEZ: Mentioned how it's going to be an international group led by Kenya.

But yesterday, Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, who has been pushing for, quote, unquote, \"a robust force,\" has asked for regional countries, Haiti's neighbors, to also step up because what you're talking about is 1,000 police officers from Kenya. But what - the U.N. also recognizes that what Haiti needs is military muscle. When you look at these gangs, they are heavily armed. They control at least 80% of Port-au-Prince. You really need assets. The country doesn't have any helicopters. It doesn't have any planes. So it really needs the ability to go in there and to secure infrastructure and also to root out these gangs. So the Kenya model right now - it's a start, but it's going to take a couple of other steps. And we're going to see, you know, how this shakes out. Who else says, yes, we'll go in?",

        "body": "One of the most preeminent modern military strategy writers and academics, Lawrence Freedman, has written an essay on the impossible position Putin finds himself in. \n\n[Putin Is Running Out of Options in Ukraine](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/putin-running-out-options-ukraine)\n______________________________________________________\nRussia Edges Closer to a Reckoning\n\nThe problem with losing goes beyond the failure to achieve objectives or even having to explain the expenditures of blood and treasure for little gain: loss casts doubt on the wisdom and competence of the government. Failure in war can cause a government to fall. That is often why governments keep on fighting wars: an admission of defeat could make it harder to hold on to power.\n\nAll of these dynamics are evident in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin set as his objectives the \u201cdenazification\u201d and \u201cdemilitarization\u201d of Ukraine. By the first, he presumably meant regime change, in which case the war has clearly been a failure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s position is as strong as ever. As for demilitarization, Ukraine is on its way to becoming the most militarized country in Europe. Many of the Russian speakers in Ukraine on whose behalf Putin claimed to be acting now prefer to speak Ukrainian, while the Russian-speaking areas of the Donbas have been battered, deindustrialized, and depopulated because of this ruinous war.\n\nRussian forces have failed to take complete control of any of the four oblasts, or administrative regions\u2014Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia\u2014that Putin claimed for Russia in September 2022. Much of the ground initially seized after the full-scale invasion has been relinquished, and more is being lost, albeit slowly, during the current Ukrainian offensive. Before February 2022, Russia could be confident that Ukraine would not be able to challenge the illegal annexation of Crimea, but now even Russia\u2019s hold of the peninsula is no longer certain. Ukraine still hopes that its war aims\u2014the liberation of all occupied land and the restoration of the borders created in 1991\u2014can be achieved. **Even if Ukraine\u2019s current offensive falters, Russia lacks for now the combat power to seize the advantage and take more territory.**\n\n**Putin is not close to achieving any of his war aims while the price of his gambit grows ever steeper.** He may, of course, believe that at least some of his original objectives are still possible, or take some comfort from those analysts in the West who are convinced that the best Ukraine can hope for is a military stalemate. But the Russian leader has never shown himself to be satisfied with a stalemate. He wants a resolution in which he can be shown to be the clear victor. When asked about negotiation, including by sympathetic interlocutors, for example from Africa, he still demands that Ukraine recognize the annexations of the four oblasts, which would require Kyiv to hand over more territory to Moscow. That is clearly not going to happen.\n\nWere Putin to accept a cease-fire based on current positions, it would ease the threat to Crimea and allow the Russian occupation of what is still a sizable chunk of Ukrainian territory. It would, however, confirm that none of Putin\u2019s goals have been met. This would become even more obvious if discussions around a cease-fire led to pressure for Russian forces to abandon some of the land they have taken. Being stuck with bits and pieces of Ukrainian territory with hostile populations, massive reconstruction bills, and long frontlines with an undefeated Ukraine would not look like a big win\u2014especially when set against the many casualties incurred by Russian forces, the degradation of the Russian army, the sputtering Russian economy, and the knock to Russia\u2019s standing as a great and influential power. As soon as the fighting stopped and troops started to come home, there would be a national reckoning, and it would not reflect well on Putin.\n\nBut now, Putin must face an even more disturbing possibility: suppose the reckoning cannot be postponed and comes before a definitive end to the fighting, not afterward. All trends\u2014military, economic, diplomatic\u2014continue to point in the wrong direction, and Putin has no convincing explanation for how the situation can be salvaged. The Russian president finds himself boxed in with no good options. He may indeed already be aware that the reckoning has begun.\n\nPrigozhin lost the immediate power struggle, his armaments, and his businesses, if not, as yet, his life or freedom. In dealing with his former confidant, Putin showed more vulnerability than weakness. The outcome made it much harder to demote his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, or top commander, Valery Gerasimov, despite their demonstrated incompetence and loss of support among the officer class. But loyalty comes first. It is the military officials closely associated with Prigozhin who have been sidelined.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerasimov apparently fired General Ivan Popov, commander of the 58th Combined Arms Air Defense Army, after he complained bitterly about the conditions imposed on his troops, who were in his words being \u201cstabbed in the back.\u201d The complaints to which Popov gave voice are widely shared and are not going to disappear, especially if Ukraine continues to disrupt Russian logistics, and it is not clear what Russian commanders can do to address them.

The Kremlin has already told this story to explain Russian setbacks and show how Ukraine is acting as an agent of the West.

He may be disappointed: similar actions have yet to dent Western support for Ukraine. Over the last six months, more and better weapons have been delivered to Kyiv. In certain respects, NATO countries are subject to the same pressures Russia is; not losing is also a vital interest of the West.\n\nPutin can simply try to hang on, but given the mounting pressures, he needs a strategy to show that Russia still has a path to victory.  What Putin does should in turn shape Ukrainian actions. Kyiv can add to the anxieties in Moscow, demonstrating that no part of Russia is secure, punishing Russian forces at the front and opportunistically liberating territory even if it is not quite what military planners intended. This has become a war of endurance. Just as Putin must hope that Ukraine and its Western supporters will tire before Russia does, Ukraine and its backers must show that they can cope with the war\u2019s demands for as long as necessary.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>One of the most preeminent modern military strategy writers and academics, Lawrence Freedman, has written an essay on the impossible position Putin finds himself in. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/putin-running-out-options-ukraine\">Putin Is Running Out of Options in Ukraine</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Russia Edges Closer to a Reckoning</p>\n\n<p>The problem with losing goes beyond the failure to achieve objectives or even having to explain the expenditures of blood and treasure for little gain: loss casts doubt on the wisdom and competence of the government. Failure in war can cause a government to fall. That is often why governments keep on fighting wars: an admission of defeat could make it harder to hold on to power.</p>\n\n<p>All of these dynamics are evident in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin set as his objectives the \u201cdenazification\u201d and \u201cdemilitarization\u201d of Ukraine. By the first, he presumably meant regime change, in which case the war has clearly been a failure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s position is as strong as ever. As for demilitarization, Ukraine is on its way to becoming the most militarized country in Europe. Many of the Russian speakers in Ukraine on whose behalf Putin claimed to be acting now prefer to speak Ukrainian, while the Russian-speaking areas of the Donbas have been battered, deindustrialized, and depopulated because of this ruinous war.</p>\n\n<p>Russian forces have failed to take complete control of any of the four oblasts, or administrative regions\u2014Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia\u2014that Putin claimed for Russia in September 2022. Much of the ground initially seized after the full-scale invasion has been relinquished, and more is being lost, albeit slowly, during the current Ukrainian offensive. Before February 2022, Russia could be confident that Ukraine would not be able to challenge the illegal annexation of Crimea, but now even Russia\u2019s hold of the peninsula is no longer certain. Ukraine still hopes that its war aims\u2014the liberation of all occupied land and the restoration of the borders created in 1991\u2014can be achieved. <strong>Even if Ukraine\u2019s current offensive falters, Russia lacks for now the combat power to seize the advantage and take more territory.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Putin is not close to achieving any of his war aims while the price of his gambit grows ever steeper.</strong> He may, of course, believe that at least some of his original objectives are still possible, or take some comfort from those analysts in the West who are convinced that the best Ukraine can hope for is a military stalemate. But the Russian leader has never shown himself to be satisfied with a stalemate. He wants a resolution in which he can be shown to be the clear victor. When asked about negotiation, including by sympathetic interlocutors, for example from Africa, he still demands that Ukraine recognize the annexations of the four oblasts, which would require Kyiv to hand over more territory to Moscow. That is clearly not going to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Were Putin to accept a cease-fire based on current positions, it would ease the threat to Crimea and allow the Russian occupation of what is still a sizable chunk of Ukrainian territory. It would, however, confirm that none of Putin\u2019s goals have been met. This would become even more obvious if discussions around a cease-fire led to pressure for Russian forces to abandon some of the land they have taken. Being stuck with bits and pieces of Ukrainian territory with hostile populations, massive reconstruction bills, and long frontlines with an undefeated Ukraine would not look like a big win\u2014especially when set against the many casualties incurred by Russian forces, the degradation of the Russian army, the sputtering Russian economy, and the knock to Russia\u2019s standing as a great and influential power. As soon as the fighting stopped and troops started to come home, there would be a national reckoning, and it would not reflect well on Putin.</p>\n\n<p>But now, Putin must face an even more disturbing possibility: suppose the reckoning cannot be postponed and comes before a definitive end to the fighting, not afterward. All trends\u2014military, economic, diplomatic\u2014continue to point in the wrong direction, and Putin has no convincing explanation for how the situation can be salvaged. The Russian president finds himself boxed in with no good options. He may indeed already be aware that the reckoning has begun.</p>\n\n<p>Prigozhin lost the immediate power struggle, his armaments, and his businesses, if not, as yet, his life or freedom. In dealing with his former confidant, Putin showed more vulnerability than weakness. The outcome made it much harder to demote his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, or top commander, Valery Gerasimov, despite their demonstrated incompetence and loss of support among the officer class. But loyalty comes first. It is the military officials closely associated with Prigozhin who have been sidelined.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Gerasimov apparently fired General Ivan Popov, commander of the 58th Combined Arms Air Defense Army, after he complained bitterly about the conditions imposed on his troops, who were in his words being \u201cstabbed in the back.\u201d The complaints to which Popov gave voice are widely shared and are not going to disappear, especially if Ukraine continues to disrupt Russian logistics, and it is not clear what Russian commanders can do to address them.

The plan was that maybe they would toss a few IEDs or light weapons to insurgents if an insurgency developed.</p>\n\n<p>Then everyone got surprised that the Ukrainians were able to stand up to Russia and, decided to help out, in no small part because the well-orchestrated Ukrainian PR campaign made not supporting Ukraine very difficult politically.</p>\n\n<p>I think you have a poor grasp of geopolitics. The reason Poland is closely tied to the US is because they expect the US will be helpful against Russian threats. Letting Russia conquer Ukraine or turn it into a failed state does not fit into the category of &quot;being helpful against Russian threats&quot;, and therefore Poland would not support a plan like that.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "I know it\u2019s usually not a good idea to feed the trolls, but I\u2019m gonna assume your impertinence is in part because your latest Kremlin check bounced. Luckily for you, I\u2019ll entertain you this single time.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s appropriate I suppose to kick it off with semantics: to check the definition of towards just follow this [link](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/towards?q=towards). I hope that clears up that misunderstanding.\r  \n\r  \nSecondly, let\u2019s establish a timeline, [here](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/07/27/7413151/) is a report about Zelensky sharing the video of Ukrainian soldiers announcing the liberation of Staromaiorske on July 27th. It was filmed during the day so we can assume that they\u2019ve liberated Staromaiorske either earlier on the 27th or if we go by their usual MO of waiting a day to publish it could\u2019ve happen as early as the 26th. Here is a [NSFL video](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/15bt9n0/ua_pov_ukrainian_soldiers_from_7th_battalion/) of Ukrainian soldiers casually strolling around Staromaiorske posted on the 28th on your favourite subreddit. DeepState for their part also noted the  liberation in their update on the 27th of July. Rybar admitted to the same fact on the 28th as you can see in the pastebin [here](https://pastebin.com/5FNGg4mT) (I\u2019ll be using pastebin extensively because otherwise it would get pretty unruly as I\u2019ve combined all the reports from Rybar referring to the days that I\u2019ll cover in my post and have provided a source for every piece of text which I\u2019ve trimmed down to only the most pertinent parts). So we can safely conclude that Staromaiorske was fully liberated roughly in the morning or early afternoon on the 27th, which gives us a nice baseline for understanding how Pro-RU sources will approach the topic.  \nNow to cover the reported counter attacks by Pro-Ru sources. Let\u2019s kick off with Rybar since I have him at hand. [Here](https://pastebin.com/964xwheJ) is his report from the 26th where he claims Russians counter attacked into the heights NW of Staromaiorske. [Here](https://pastebin.com/5GMDRafL) is his report from the 27th where he claims Russians are performing a counter attack from the southern portion of the village into the UA-held northern part of the village. [Here](https://pastebin.com/CdsLDpwd) he makes a claim that Russians are still holding onto the outskirts of Staromaiorske on the 30th of July, which they couldn't do without counter attacking after, per Rybar himself, losing the whole village prior to this day. [Here](https://pastebin.com/VVkQsSfq) he claims that on the 31st of July Russians are performing positional attacks into Staromaiorske with the expressed purpose of dislodging AFU out of the village. Curious how you\u2019re able to replicate almost exact wording Rybar uses twice to describe the state of the village and yet fail to remember that he mentioned those attacks taking place in those same posts. Funny how that brain of your works. And moving onto the last report published [today](https://pastebin.com/4HZzWqHS) where he claims that Russian units are performing sorties around the village in order to improve their positions. So per Rybar Russians went over the following stages: firstly counter attacking Ukrainians on the heights NW of Staromaiorske, secondly counter attacking from the southern portion into the northern portion, thirdly performing counter attacks in order to expel AFU from Staromaiorske itself and now lastly performing sorties in order to improve their positions around Staromaiorske \u2013 in other words there is not a single step in the whole liberation process which wasn\u2019t followed up by some sort of counter attack according to Rybar. So off with him into the non-credible bin I suppose. \r  \n\r  \nAs for RVvoenkor on the 29th, which you can [check here](https://pastebin.com/Z0HUJnWe) he describes an allegedly successful counter attack on Staromaiorske. If you look around his feed, you\u2019ll find a few more sprinkled in the days before this. I suppose off with him to the bin of non-credibility, too.\r  \n\r  \nLastly, as to the topography of the general area \u2013 the height NW of Staromaiorske are a bit larger than those further south and offer a good overview of the battlefield. It should be noted no Ukrainian mapper ever claimed the heights further south were secured, and Suriyak curiously dropped his claim of successful counter attack in that area from his map without ever saying anything about it. You can check the live map [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1V8NzjQkzMOhpuLhkktbiKgodOQ27X6IV&ll=47.73315350355122%2C36.84120275730585&z=13). Don't worry, I took a screenshot if you should ever need it.\r  \n\r  \nP.s. I didn\u2019t want to include WarGonzo because I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s perished quite some time ago somewhere in a trench near Robotyne, but luckily for us he too from beyond [did not disappoint](https://pastebin.com/DYb6aph8) claiming fighting for Staromaiorske on the 28th which is, as we have previously established, almost a full day after it was liberated meaning Russians were likely counter attacking inside the village, which tracks with what Rybar reports, too. He then goes on to pretty much claim Russian counter attacks \u201cnear\u201d Novomaiorske for every single day except for the 31st when he claims Russians attacked \u201cat\u201d Novomaiorske and actually regained some of their positions. Off to the bin with him, too. Who is even left for you to follow at this point?",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I know it\u2019s usually not a good idea to feed the trolls, but I\u2019m gonna assume your impertinence is in part because your latest Kremlin check bounced. Luckily for you, I\u2019ll entertain you this single time.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s appropriate I suppose to kick it off with semantics: to check the definition of towards just follow this <a href=\"https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/towards?q=towards\">link</a>. I hope that clears up that misunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, let\u2019s establish a timeline, <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/07/27/7413151/\">here</a> is a report about Zelensky sharing the video of Ukrainian soldiers announcing the liberation of Staromaiorske on July 27th. It was filmed during the day so we can assume that they\u2019ve liberated Staromaiorske either earlier on the 27th or if we go by their usual MO of waiting a day to publish it could\u2019ve happen as early as the 26th. Here is a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/15bt9n0/ua_pov_ukrainian_soldiers_from_7th_battalion/\">NSFL video</a> of Ukrainian soldiers casually strolling around Staromaiorske posted on the 28th on your favourite subreddit. DeepState for their part also noted the  liberation in their update on the 27th of July. Rybar admitted to the same fact on the 28th as you can see in the pastebin <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/5FNGg4mT\">here</a> (I\u2019ll be using pastebin extensively because otherwise it would get pretty unruly as I\u2019ve combined all the reports from Rybar referring to the days that I\u2019ll cover in my post and have provided a source for every piece of text which I\u2019ve trimmed down to only the most pertinent parts). So we can safely conclude that Staromaiorske was fully liberated roughly in the morning or early afternoon on the 27th, which gives us a nice baseline for understanding how Pro-RU sources will approach the topic.<br/>\nNow to cover the reported counter attacks by Pro-Ru sources. Let\u2019s kick off with Rybar since I have him at hand. <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/964xwheJ\">Here</a> is his report from the 26th where he claims Russians counter attacked into the heights NW of Staromaiorske. <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/5GMDRafL\">Here</a> is his report from the 27th where he claims Russians are performing a counter attack from the southern portion of the village into the UA-held northern part of the village. <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/CdsLDpwd\">Here</a> he makes a claim that Russians are still holding onto the outskirts of Staromaiorske on the 30th of July, which they couldn&#39;t do without counter attacking after, per Rybar himself, losing the whole village prior to this day. <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/VVkQsSfq\">Here</a> he claims that on the 31st of July Russians are performing positional attacks into Staromaiorske with the expressed purpose of dislodging AFU out of the village. Curious how you\u2019re able to replicate almost exact wording Rybar uses twice to describe the state of the village and yet fail to remember that he mentioned those attacks taking place in those same posts. Funny how that brain of your works. And moving onto the last report published <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/4HZzWqHS\">today</a> where he claims that Russian units are performing sorties around the village in order to improve their positions. So per Rybar Russians went over the following stages: firstly counter attacking Ukrainians on the heights NW of Staromaiorske, secondly counter attacking from the southern portion into the northern portion, thirdly performing counter attacks in order to expel AFU from Staromaiorske itself and now lastly performing sorties in order to improve their positions around Staromaiorske \u2013 in other words there is not a single step in the whole liberation process which wasn\u2019t followed up by some sort of counter attack according to Rybar. So off with him into the non-credible bin I suppose. </p>\n\n<p>As for RVvoenkor on the 29th, which you can <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/Z0HUJnWe\">check here</a> he describes an allegedly successful counter attack on Staromaiorske. If you look around his feed, you\u2019ll find a few more sprinkled in the days before this. I suppose off with him to the bin of non-credibility, too.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, as to the topography of the general area \u2013 the height NW of Staromaiorske are a bit larger than those further south and offer a good overview of the battlefield.

Don&#39;t worry, I took a screenshot if you should ever need it.</p>\n\n<p>P.s.

In April, Azerbaijan took the next step to make the blockade more permanent, establishing a checkpoint on the road on the Hakkari river near the Armenian border.

Combined arms operations does not need to include air assets. In fact one can check any of the many definitions for combined arms and none of them necessitate the use of air assets. The crucial aspect of combined arms operations is the synchronization and coordination of attacks.\n\nSo when Kofman et al. based on interviews with Ukrainian military members, [a ukrainian intel officers](https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1685074787553378304?t=7A1wd9i4n_yUSQgowfGEBw&s=19), and [military advisors to Ukraine](https://warontherocks.com/2023/06/what-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-need-to-do-to-win/) all say that Ukraine is struggling with combined arms they don't mean \"we can't do anything because we don't have air superiority\". To use a real life example from early in the counteroffensive they \"we cannot synchronize artillery and infantry attacks often ending barrages several hours before infantry operations\" meaning enemy assets in the area are no longer suppressed by fires.\n\nBased on the incorrect assumption that air superiority = combined arms I've seen a couple posters make the also incorrect assumption that NATO/US would also struggle here. I won't speak for the rest of NATO but the US army is not limited to using air assets when in need of long range fires as I think the HIMAARS platform, 20 years old platform by the way, has proven\n\nI recommend these two comments from u/Duncan-M for further reading.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15cqkp3/CredibleDefense_Daily_MegaThread_July_29,_2023/jtzhxjr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15b009w/credibledefense_daily_megathread_july_27_2023/jtoxaaz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2",

The crucial aspect of combined arms operations is the synchronization and coordination of attacks.</p>\n\n<p>So when Kofman et al. based on interviews with Ukrainian military members, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1685074787553378304?t=7A1wd9i4n_yUSQgowfGEBw&amp;s=19\">a ukrainian intel officers</a>, and <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2023/06/what-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-need-to-do-to-win/\">military advisors to Ukraine</a> all say that Ukraine is struggling with combined arms they don&#39;t mean &quot;we can&#39;t do anything because we don&#39;t have air superiority&quot;. To use a real life example from early in the counteroffensive they &quot;we cannot synchronize artillery and infantry attacks often ending barrages several hours before infantry operations&quot; meaning enemy assets in the area are no longer suppressed by fires.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the incorrect assumption that air superiority = combined arms I&#39;ve seen a couple posters make the also incorrect assumption that NATO/US would also struggle here. I won&#39;t speak for the rest of NATO but the US army is not limited to using air assets when in need of long range fires as I think the HIMAARS platform, 20 years old platform by the way, has proven</p>\n\n<p>I recommend these two comments from <a href=\"/u/Duncan-M\">u/Duncan-M</a> for further reading.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15cqkp3/CredibleDefense_Daily_MegaThread_July_29,_2023/jtzhxjr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15cqkp3/CredibleDefense_Daily_MegaThread_July_29,_2023/jtzhxjr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15b009w/credibledefense_daily_megathread_july_27_2023/jtoxaaz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15b009w/credibledefense_daily_megathread_july_27_2023/jtoxaaz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2</a></p>\n</div>",

It wasn't until the mid 70s until funding was unlocked in a bigger scale, with a new generation of technological advances that led to the leap ahead technology the US had in the 80s and 90s.

Artillery made a resurgence after Rumsfeld was replaced and things got worse, but they too suffered the issues of inaccurate arty (pre-Excalibur days) that was dispersed to the point that certain combat outposts only had a single artillery piece to support it and neighboring COPs that often only had mortars for indirect fire defense.\n\nWhy is this important? \n\nBecause the US has to prep for wars other than the types that the Soviet Union, and Ukraine and Russia, all plan for.

Then the infantry BCTs, they have nothing similar*, and make up the majority of the BCT types (over half).

Then the heavies come out and blow shit up.\n\nSome of the IBCT might also be airborne paratrooper qualified (limited lift capacity, they walk after landing), or air assault qualifed (limited lift capacity, they walk after landing).

But two months after President Joe Biden announced US support for training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s, there remain a number of critical details to work out.\n\n>The US still needs to approve the transfer of F-16-specific equipment and materials, including flight simulators and training manuals. But officials told CNN that the Biden administration has not yet received a final training plan from the Europeans, meaning there is nothing for the US to sign off on yet.\n\n>It is also still unclear which countries will commit F-16s to the training program \u2013 and to Ukraine itself once the program is finished. Transferring the planes to Ukraine will require separate US approval.\n\n>US defense officials told CNN that the US is still deciding whether to send American pilots to help train the Ukrainians, but that no decisions will be made until a final training plan is authorized.\n\n>A spokesperson for Denmark\u2019s Ministry of Defense would not comment directly on whether the country had submitted a formal plan to the US for approval. But the spokesperson provided a one-page training concept to CNN that said the course will aim to train pilots and ground crew over a span of six months, taking place at a number of locations including Skrydstrup Fighter Base in Denmark.\n\n>The training concept also said the coalition had agreed to support the training with \u201clanguage experts, pilots, ground crew, instructors, aircraft or funding as appropriate. Ukraine is expected to provide qualified personnel able to pass necessary language, health, and security tests.\u201d\n\n>A spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Defense said they had no updates. Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren told CNN last month that the training was set to begin in Denmark in August, and then be continued \u201cin a sustainable way\u201d at a training hub in Romania. The training program will be for Ukraine and \u201calso for other countries who are transitioning to the fourth generation fighter jets,\u201d she said.\n\n>>A faster training timeline\n\n>The training program is being supported by a coalition of 11 NATO countries and requires official US approval because the F-16 is an American technology.\n\n>The course itself is expected to be conducted in Denmark and Romania, with help from the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the UK, officials have said. But the details, including the dates, locations, and length of the syllabus \u201care still being worked out,\u201d National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby said during a briefing last week.\n\n>Ukrainians have come to the US for military training in the past, specifically on Patriot air defense systems at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. But US officials have emphasized that all the training on F-16s will take place in Europe.\n\n>Even so, the final syllabus for the course will probably be similar to one created by the US Air Force earlier this year, officials said. The Air Force devised a hypothetical training plan after observing the skills of two Ukrainian pilots flying F-16 simulators at Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n>An internal Air Force memo detailing the assessment, first obtained by Yahoo and verified to CNN by an Air Force official, said the Ukrainians\u2019 skillset suggested that training could be completed in four to five months.\n\n>The timeline is faster than the standard F-16 training program for US Air Force pilots, but it strips out missions and tasks unnecessary for Ukrainian pilots facing off against the Russian military, doing away with things like air-to-air refueling and instrument landing procedures.\n\n>The number of Ukrainian pilots set to be trained is also still being determined, but the Air Force memo recommended a pool of 10-12 participants. That is in line with the number of pilots US defense officials believe Ukraine will be able to realistically sacrifice for a months-long training course in Europe as the war rages on.\n\n>The Ukrainians will also have to clear another key hurdle before they can train on the F-16s: English-language proficiency. The Air Force memo described the pilots\u2019 English-language aptitude as a \u201cconcern\u201d and said \u201cadditional language training will be required for the majority of the initial cadre\u201d of pilots. The UK has offered to provide that instruction as part of the course, officials said, and the US is considering providing English teachers to the program as well.\n\n>>\u2018The US will not be the holdup\u2019\n\n>Ukraine has been pleading for the advanced western jets for more than a year, arguing that they will provide the military with additional air defense and offensive capabilities.\n\n>Though F-16s began flying at about the same time as the Mig-29s and Su-27s in Ukraine\u2019s Air Force, the American fighter has been continuously upgraded with more advanced digital electronics and avionics, making it a more capable multi-role aircraft than Kyiv\u2019s Soviet-era fighter fleet.\n\n>The fourth-generation F-16 can perform air-to-air missions, defending Ukraine\u2019s airspace against Russian aircraft, and air-to-ground missions, attacking Russian forces on the battlefield. The F-16 has also been exported to many countries around the world, including in Europe, providing Ukraine with a potential supply of weaponry and spare parts once they acquire the jet.\n\n>US officials have emphasized that they won\u2019t be an impediment to the F1-6 training, and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN last month that the US will provide the necessary support for the program \u201cas soon as the Europeans are prepared.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe president has given a green light, and we will allow, permit, support, facilitate, and, in fact, provide the necessary tools for Ukrainians to begin being trained on F-16s as soon as the Europeans are prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States will not be the holdup in ensuring that this F-16 training can get under way.\u201d",

Manpower wise they&#39;re still unfavourable in comparisons to Ukraine which has had far more widespread drafting (by comparison to total population). Granted there is another wave of mobilization coming in toward October/end of the year, so the longer Russia can drag this out the better manned those lines will become.</p>\n</div>",

Basically, I think we can infer from widespread shortages across multiple separately supplied sectors of the front, the sourcing of supplementary 152mm ammo from North Korea, and the observed dramatic reductions in Russian long range fires over the past nine months that there are serious constraints on sourcing ammunition in addition to the constraints imposed by the Ukrainians on transporting ammunition to the tactical edge.\n\n[The Russians fired around 12 million last year, and can produce only about 1 million per year](https://static.rusi.org/403-SR-Russian-Tactics-web-final.pdf). A sizeable amount of ammunition has also been lost to Ukrainian strikes on ammunition depots, although that is of course harder to quantify from data in the open source. Had they continued their artillery bombardments at the same level of intensity achieved during February through November 2022 during the period from December through today, they would have completely exhausted their reserves and their entire year's worth of production from that period and would be quite literally out of ammunition.\n\nThey clearly have slowed their fire rates down considerably, though, so it is likely they either have or will soon run down the last of their available reserves (including the subset of stored ammo that is in usable condition, that is appropriate for the available calibers and weapons at the front, and that is not withheld for internal security purposes) and are now or soon will be relying exclusively on new production. Notably, no one really knows exactly how much ammo they have in storage, nor how much of it is actually usable. Best estimates I have seen put the pre-war total at 19 million rounds of artillery ammunition of all calibers, with some unknown percentage likely in poor condition. \n\nRelying exclusively on new production will constrain them to something like 83k shells per month (1m/12). And that's assuming every shell reaches a gun, rather than being blown up in a depot somewhere. Compare that 83k to the average rate of 1.2 million shells fired per month in 2022, and you can see why the Russians might be having some difficulty, disrupted GLOCs or not. They also will be firing those shells from barrels that have been pushed to the absolute limits of their expected lifetime endurance, and so will be firing less accurately than they were when they were firing 1.2m shells per month, and thus will require more rounds to achieve the same effect on the ground. \n\nBottom line: the GLOC disruptions certainly compound the ammunition shortages, but I don't think they can explain them completely, which means we will likely see them persist to some degree even if the Russians repair or work around those damaged logistics nodes.",

They've scored the majority of visually confirmed Ukrainian artillery losses over the past 6-12 months. That's at least partially due to bias though, as they're generally coupled with another UAV monitoring the target and conducting BDA.

The Russians are scraping the barrel in terms of being able to deploy the formations that are currently in reserve in Kherson Oblast, considering that a certain amount of them have to remain in the area to thwart potential Ukrainian attempts to cross the Dnipro.\n\nAnyway - Ukrainian 5th Tank Brigade is one of the biggest mysteries for those who follow the order of battle in this conflict. Since the beginning of the war every three months or so it has been said that it was being formed or even deployed somewhere. But then there has never been confirmation. Last week there was a new report that it was being activated and received the insignia, but we still have no definitive confirmation. Personally, I am skeptical that it can be fully activated, as the tank brigades require a lot of tanks of which there is no surplus at all, and that's the reason why Ukraine so far had not created any new tank brigade; in fact, these seem to have been rather underutilized compared to the others over the last year. Even now most of them are supposed to be deployed around Velyka Novosilka but have yet to see substantial action. I find it likely that they acted somewhat as a pool to replenish tank losses of the rest of the brigades.\n\nThe 42nd Mech should already be in action in Kreminna, right? Another brigade I am very curious about is the 13th Jager, we haven't had any updates since they were training in Norway, if I'm not wrong.",
