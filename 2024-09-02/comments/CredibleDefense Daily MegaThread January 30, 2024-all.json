Excerpts:\n\n>[Russia Hires Its Own Africa Army to Succeed Wagner\u2019s Mercenaries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-30/russia-recruiting-africa-army-to-replace-wagner-group?srnd=politics-vp)\n\n>* Kremlin bids to revive Cold War-era clout on the continent\n>* Russia forms Africa Corps to control Wagner\u2019s business empire\n\n>The Africa Corps would bolster Russia\u2019s military presence with what it says would be a network of planned Defense Ministry-controlled bases, in a bid to revive Moscow\u2019s Cold War-era clout on the continent at a time of steeply declining Western influence. It would also allow the Kremlin to consolidate control of Wagner\u2019s business network in Africa, including potentially lucrative mining interests, following the death last year of the group\u2019s founder Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\n>The Africa Corps, which controversially shares the name of Adolf Hitler\u2019s expeditionary force, aims to enlist new recruits and former Wagner fighters by mid-year to deploy to at least five Russia-friendly countries \u2014 Burkina Faso, Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic and Niger \u2014 according to the group. Wagner was technically disbanded following Prigozhin\u2019s death but remains active.\n\n>But it remains to be seen where it will be able to find the 20,000 soldiers that a person close to the Russian Defense Ministry said the group seeks. At its peak, Wagner\u2019s African operations numbered at most several thousand personnel and Russia is already trying to recruit at least another 250,000 troops to fight in Ukraine this year.\n\n\n>Moscow\u2019s approach has started small. Last Wednesday, about 100 Russian troops arrived in Burkina Faso to provide security for Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, the soldier who seized power in a 2022 military coup, the group said in a statement posted on its Telegram channel.\n\n>But it has ambitious plans, seeking to build a regional headquarters in the Central African Republic, where over the past six years Wagner has waged a brutal campaign on behalf of the president, and embedded itself in the national security apparatus in exchange for diamonds and gold.\n\n>Moscow has capitalized on the destabilization in West Africa wrought by military coups and Islamist insurgencies in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, exacerbated by popular resentment of former colonial power France and perceived Western meddling.\n\n>Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, who\u2019s in charge of taking over Wagner activities in Africa and the Middle East, visited Niger in early December. The country\u2019s prime minister traveled to Moscow for talks and the signing of a new defense agreement with the Kremlin this month.\n\n>In November, Mali\u2019s army recaptured the strategic northern town of Kidal, which had been held by separatist rebels for over a decade, with the help of Russian fighters. As in other countries, Mali has seen Wagner contractors slowly \u2014 though not fully \u2014 replaced by regular army forces, two Western officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n>Along with its role in propping up regimes, the Africa Corps is expected to maintain Wagner\u2019s focus on extracting raw resources with the goal of bringing in hard currency to finance the war in Ukraine, the officials said.\n\nAnd in the Pacific:\n\n>[Russia to Deploy New Weapons on Disputed Kuril Islands](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-30/russia-to-deploy-new-weapons-on-kuril-islands-medvedev-says?srnd=politics-vp)\n\n>Russia plans to deploy new weapons on islands that are at the center of a decades-long territorial dispute with Japan, according to former President Dmitry Medvedev, who\u2019s the current deputy head of the country\u2019s Security Council.\n\n>The strategic role of the Kuril Islands will increase \u201cincluding stationing new weapons there,\u201d Medvedev said Tuesday on the X social-media platform. \u201cWe don\u2019t give a damn about the \u2018feelings of the Japanese\u2019 concerning the so-called \u2018Northern territories\u2019.

That's extremely murky territory and there's bound to be a lot of buzz around this.

Doctors shouldn't be conflated with combatants and anyone who seeks to muddy those waters, to me at least, is in the wrong. \n\nAs for Israeli operations, it seems they're really upping the ante in these types of operations, there's been a few recently but I will admit I'm not following this conflict very closely.

Israel is in a difficult place politically, with unease worldwide over the Palestinian death toll, and even a UN investigation of supposed genocide. The world is willing to go along with fighting back against October 7, at least to a point, but probably not if it becomes a land grab. Even from a nationalist Israeli perspective the justification for such settlements is dubious - unlike in the West Bank there is no chance of creating significant regions that are heavily Jewish in population and thus likely to remain Israeli in the long term. Which is probably why a right wing Israeli leader was willing to remove Gaza settlements to begin with in 2005.\n\n> They've escalated settlements after basically every war they've won\n\nThat's a strange statement.

Israel is in a difficult place politically, with unease worldwide over the Palestinian death toll, and even a UN investigation of supposed genocide. The world is willing to go along with fighting back against October 7, at least to a point, but probably not if it becomes a land grab. Even from a nationalist Israeli perspective the justification for such settlements is dubious - unlike in the West Bank there is no chance of creating significant regions that are heavily Jewish in population and thus likely to remain Israeli in the long term. Which is probably why a right wing Israeli leader was willing to remove Gaza settlements to begin with in 2005.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They&#39;ve escalated settlements after basically every war they&#39;ve won</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a strange statement.

It was largely dismissed as Russian propaganda at the time, but their spat went fully public in fall 2023 and many have since confirmed that their disagreements did include the decision to reinforce Bakhmut.\n\nUnofficially, my opinion is there is a laundry list of other reasons to substantiate the current breakdown in their professional relationship. \n\n1). Zelensky was a large reason for the poor UAF preparedness during the early phases of the war. Not that Zaluzhny was prepared for a Kyiv or Kherson attack, he admitted he didn't plan for it, but any remotely competent officer would have wanted to mobilize and deploy into forward defensive areas just as a precaution considering Jan-Feb 2022 signs of a Russian invasion. If denied by Zelensky, against Zaluzhny's advice, that could have seriously soured the relationship since the start of the war. \n\n2). Despite being mostly responsible for Ukraine's unpreparedness, Zelensky's administration has aggressively gone after civil and military scapegoats.

Zelensky was a large reason for the poor UAF preparedness during the early phases of the war.

If denied by Zelensky, against Zaluzhny&#39;s advice, that could have seriously soured the relationship since the start of the war. </p>\n\n<p>2).

What happens after the strikes? \n\nThere's no good evidence or reason to believe Iran would not respond in some way or the various militias in the region attacking the US or international shipping lanes would suddenly cease their attacks. The solution to ending these attacks is diplomacy not military. All these attacks ceased when there was ceasefire in Gaza back in November - I don't remember hearing about a single attack not even by HZB against Israel.

What happens after the strikes? </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no good evidence or reason to believe Iran would not respond in some way or the various militias in the region attacking the US or international shipping lanes would suddenly cease their attacks. The solution to ending these attacks is diplomacy not military. All these attacks ceased when there was ceasefire in Gaza back in November - I don&#39;t remember hearing about a single attack not even by HZB against Israel.

China wants Taiwan for its own understanding of national pride, that being unity at all costs.</p>\n\n<p>Countries united around common purpose have power that is more than the sum of their parts. Russia is a country that by all rights should be sinking deep into malaise, a continuation of the 90s. Yet they have hundreds of thousands of men willing to die for... The Donbas. Some stagnant region with no future because its past was based on coal. Might as well go to war for West Virginia. Not because they need the resources, but because Putin has successfully made them think it&#39;s Russia, and that Ukraine is Germany on the attack.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Russia&#39;s pride at having defeated the Nazi invasion at the cost of a substantial fraction of their populace is one of the few things they can point to as a positive legacy. After the memory of the 90s, they&#39;d do anything to feel that again. Small wonder they&#39;re so willing to accept enormous casualties. To those who know what Russia suffered back then, this is nothing.</p>\n</div>",

Increased numbers and enhanced abilities for the Russians does not bode well for Ukraine and particularly any UAF member that's coming across the river to maintain or attempt to expand the Krynky bridgehead.  Being able to bypass defense systems is a particularly noteworthy development with any drone because at times other safety operating procedures might be neglected due to the overall feeling of safety the defense system provides.  \n\nWith drones having recently taken the lives of U.S. service members any and all advancements in the drone war should be on the front of the minds of any military staff officer (of any military) that's trying to keep anti-drone SOPs up to date. Or create the SOP in the first place as new types of drones and drone attack strategies are developed, defeated, re-adapted, and re-introduced.  \n\nIt does seem to be more of the same with regards to the Krynky bridgehead.  Lots of losses and both sides still willing to keep those losses going. Second article was posted yesterday Jan 29 and makes the claim that *\"According to multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources, Moscow\u2019s attempts to wipe out the bridgehead employing substantial ground attacks have virtually come to a halt.\"* and that Ukraine will *\u201ccontinue measures aimed at expanding its bridgehead.\u201d*\n\n[Russian Forces Intensify Use of Drones in Southern Ukraine | Defense Express | January 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/russian_forces_intensify_use_of_drones_in_southern_ukraine-9345.html)\n\n*Russian troops have intensified the use of drones in southern Ukraine, with over 80 units recorded in the region within a day. Nataliia Humeniuk, Head of the Joint Press Centre of Operational Command South, reported this at the Ukraine-Ukrinform media center.*\n\n*Humeniuk stated that the Russians are deploying FPV drones capable of dropping fragmentation munitions, along with various other modifications, including those designed for reconnaissance.*\n\n*\"The enemy does not cease activities in the Right Bank direction. The liberated territories in the immediate vicinity of the water are particularly affected by regular shelling and the use of drones. Over the last two days, a record number of FPV drones have been observed, up to 80 during one combat day. This is mainly in Kherson Oblast.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Some updates on the drone war in Ukraine in the first article.  Increased numbers and enhanced abilities for the Russians does not bode well for Ukraine and particularly any UAF member that&#39;s coming across the river to maintain or attempt to expand the Krynky bridgehead.  Being able to bypass defense systems is a particularly noteworthy development with any drone because at times other safety operating procedures might be neglected due to the overall feeling of safety the defense system provides.  </p>\n\n<p>With drones having recently taken the lives of U.S. service members any and all advancements in the drone war should be on the front of the minds of any military staff officer (of any military) that&#39;s trying to keep anti-drone SOPs up to date. Or create the SOP in the first place as new types of drones and drone attack strategies are developed, defeated, re-adapted, and re-introduced.  </p>\n\n<p>It does seem to be more of the same with regards to the Krynky bridgehead.  Lots of losses and both sides still willing to keep those losses going. Second article was posted yesterday Jan 29 and makes the claim that <em>&quot;According to multiple Ukrainian and Russian sources, Moscow\u2019s attempts to wipe out the bridgehead employing substantial ground attacks have virtually come to a halt.&quot;</em> and that Ukraine will <em>\u201ccontinue measures aimed at expanding its bridgehead.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/news/russian_forces_intensify_use_of_drones_in_southern_ukraine-9345.html\">Russian Forces Intensify Use of Drones in Southern Ukraine | Defense Express | January 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Russian troops have intensified the use of drones in southern Ukraine, with over 80 units recorded in the region within a day. Nataliia Humeniuk, Head of the Joint Press Centre of Operational Command South, reported this at the Ukraine-Ukrinform media center.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Humeniuk stated that the Russians are deploying FPV drones capable of dropping fragmentation munitions, along with various other modifications, including those designed for reconnaissance.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The enemy does not cease activities in the Right Bank direction. The liberated territories in the immediate vicinity of the water are particularly affected by regular shelling and the use of drones. Over the last two days, a record number of FPV drones have been observed, up to 80 during one combat day. This is mainly in Kherson Oblast. This presents a substantial threat and indicates an enhanced capability on their part,&quot; Humeniuk noted.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>She also clarified that the Russians are launching drones from the Kinburn Spit in the direction of Mykolaiv Oblast.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Humeniuk noted that Russians continually modify their tactics to find ways of bypassing Ukrainian air defense systems.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>According to the spokesperson, such actions by the enemy indicate intentions to disperse the Defense Forces along the entire length of this front section.

                "body": ">Just checked online and apparently T-90MSs are supposed to replace these tanks. Well, those deliveries may be pushed back a bit.\n\nThe Kuwaiti contract for T90MS dates back to 2017 and was already postponed back in 2019, these postponements have been (as far as I'm aware) on the Kuwaiti side, which leads me to believe that Kuwait is playing the procurement game to try and see if they can swap their T90MS purchases for something else. \n\nCAATSA came into effect just before the Kuwaiti contract, which would mean that Kuwait signed it aware of the potential consequences and that any push to complete the purchase would bring Kuwait under the same banner of sanctions as was threatened against Egypt for its purchase of the Su35 and India for its purchase of the S-400. \n\nGranted the sanctions are relatively toothless, they're a bluff intended to try and pressure countries to buy American and they are largely successful-ish (they arguably failed in regards to the Su-35 and Iran as an unintended consequence but on the direct level they succeeded in stopping Egypt from buying Russian equipment at the time).\n\nKuwait was playing for time before the war impacted potential T90 deliveries, now that the war is in full swing Kuwait will have all of the excuse it needs to drop out of the contract, although it's my estimation that they never had any intention of completing the contract in the first place and were using it as a negotiating tool to purchase equipment elsewhere potentially at a lower rate if the US was willing to play ball in cutting Russia out of the equation. I guess with the war negating any chance of deliveries Kuwait have no more bargaining power. \n\nIt's worth noting that of the 200 M-84s that Kuwait initially ordered, only 149 were actually delivered and the Shahid armoured brigade only operates 70 M-84's, a large number of these tanks may be non operational or potentially in long term storage. We don't have much solid news on this potential refurbishment/transfer to Ukraine, and any tanks is a good thing, but it will be interesting to see how many actually end up in Ukraine and also how long the refurbishment process might take.

Well, those deliveries may be pushed back a bit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kuwaiti contract for T90MS dates back to 2017 and was already postponed back in 2019, these postponements have been (as far as I&#39;m aware) on the Kuwaiti side, which leads me to believe that Kuwait is playing the procurement game to try and see if they can swap their T90MS purchases for something else. </p>\n\n<p>CAATSA came into effect just before the Kuwaiti contract, which would mean that Kuwait signed it aware of the potential consequences and that any push to complete the purchase would bring Kuwait under the same banner of sanctions as was threatened against Egypt for its purchase of the Su35 and India for its purchase of the S-400. </p>\n\n<p>Granted the sanctions are relatively toothless, they&#39;re a bluff intended to try and pressure countries to buy American and they are largely successful-ish (they arguably failed in regards to the Su-35 and Iran as an unintended consequence but on the direct level they succeeded in stopping Egypt from buying Russian equipment at the time).</p>\n\n<p>Kuwait was playing for time before the war impacted potential T90 deliveries, now that the war is in full swing Kuwait will have all of the excuse it needs to drop out of the contract, although it&#39;s my estimation that they never had any intention of completing the contract in the first place and were using it as a negotiating tool to purchase equipment elsewhere potentially at a lower rate if the US was willing to play ball in cutting Russia out of the equation. I guess with the war negating any chance of deliveries Kuwait have no more bargaining power. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s worth noting that of the 200 M-84s that Kuwait initially ordered, only 149 were actually delivered and the Shahid armoured brigade only operates 70 M-84&#39;s, a large number of these tanks may be non operational or potentially in long term storage. We don&#39;t have much solid news on this potential refurbishment/transfer to Ukraine, and any tanks is a good thing, but it will be interesting to see how many actually end up in Ukraine and also how long the refurbishment process might take. For arguments sake assuming a negative outcome, only 50 tanks, that would still be a much welcomed addition to Ukraine&#39;s capabilities.</p>\n</div>",
