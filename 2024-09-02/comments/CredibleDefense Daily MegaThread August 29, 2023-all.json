      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Likely they are saving up their PGMs and drones for a saturation attack to pave the way for a VKS SEAD campaign, which in turn will enable them to drop cheap dumb bombs on factories from mid- to high- altitudes with total impunity, at a fraction of the cost as it would take with Iskanders, for example. And they are probably trying to time that attack for the moment when Ukrainian AD is at its weakest, just before sufficient F-16s are introduced to relieve the pressure on their limited remaining stocks of long range SAMs, when Ukrainian AD capabilities will likely be at their weakest point for the foreseeable future, hoping to establish air dominance before the F-16s can be transferred, which would potentially make transferring them impossible.

We don't know the extent of this, but given the scale of other fraud in China, we imagine it's rather extensive.\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, to my knowledge, Chinese electric vehicles are not adopted anywhere in the west, because in China every corner that can be cut can be cut and corruption makes Russia look above board.  \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-B5sIm_JmB4&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjtpa7z_IKBAxX5m4kEHcEHDlYQtwJ6BAgGEAE&usg=AOvVaw36IeMiGPw5KAWHYfV9DoXr\n\nI apologize that the YouTube link is a little bit sensationalist on the thumbnail but the data is sound, The ones that are on the road are a death trap and absolutely word is getting around.

I don't have the link handy, but analysts took the press releases for some of these vehicles and assessed the models presented to the public and we found that the particular digital assets for the model of their hydrogen transport were pulled from an on the market off the shelf 3D rendering tool kit.  \n\nDespite supposedly being so far ahead in green energy, here's what they're actually doing:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.npr.org/2023/03/02/1160441919/china-is-building-six-times-more-new-coal-plants-than-other-countries-report-fin&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjk6r65_YKBAxVJkokEHfnrCsgQFnoECAAQAg&usg=AOvVaw1BwfPEnNR4BkK5eKNwU0M0\n\nAgain, I apologize about the amp links, but new browsers on phones make it nearly impossible to make direct links.\n\nThe economic number is coming out of China. Do not naturally progress this fast; velocity of money is the constraint such that economies, improve in performance and decrease in performance at predicted rates based on the velocity of money.\n\nAdditionally, satellite measurement of GDP has been conducted, indicating that China's GDP is probably 60% less than stated; I know this seems absurd and the methodology is one of those that people attack by nitpicking, but the paper substantiating that has withstood multiple peer reviews, including validation of divergence between satellite measurements of GDP performance between democracies and other autocratic countries; in other words, the conclusions of the degree of exaggeration of GDP by China reached by the satellite data research is consistent with what we have found among all autocratic economies, from which we have a much more complete real picture.\n\nThese numbers coming out of China this month, It's no surprise that they have stopped reporting youth unemployment; What they snuck by under our noses was that in April they stopped reporting the Chinese consumer confidence index when it ran below 80 which is a horrific number.\n\nThe cessation of the reporting of key economic indicators is literally the criteria by which time of death is declared for an economy under traditional analysis.  We have no evidence of any actual functional capability on behalf of China commensurate with the rest of the Western world at all.\n\nFor example, just to indicate how divergent the real value of what has been made in China is from the book value, their astronomical construction rate can be explained quite simply-- every corner was cut, including geological analysis, environmental impact analysis, and across their 30 megalopolises, none of them have drainage.  The real value of the production of China has a negative GDP number. What they have created is literal death traps and the degree of underreporting of fatalities from the last 4 years of flooding is beyond belief.\n\nChina economically has collapsed.  We anticipate seeing this unfold rapidly, their ability to sustain the bubble has been exhausted. Contagion has occurred, and although they were able to lie their way through an artificially support, the bankruptcy of evergrand, We now have massive systemic bankruptcies where that is not going to be the case; their largest property developer is behind on bond payments and this time around there is no way to lie their way through- if this property developer does not come through on their bond payment by September 4th, they will be de-listed from their index, destroying the asset side of their balance shape.\n\nAssessment of contagion effects indicate that underreporting in their shadow banking sector and secreting away government debt amongst regional entities instead of national entities should be sufficient for an astonishing rapid de evolution.  Their imports exports are down 15% year over year in July, which if you remember last July they were in the middle of zero covid lockdowns.  Given that base number is from the zero covet lockdown This additional observed decrease is basically catastrophic on a structural level.\n\nPeople have discussed possible kinetic military confrontation between the United States and China, more and more evidence is coming out that the United States may have handled the problem economically instead of via kinetic confrontation.\n\nIt is not safe to make any projections about the economic component of any conflict at this point in time.\n\nThe degree of the misinformation is just now being revealed with a headline that broke today:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/meta-disrupts-chinese-misinformation-network-linked-to-law-enforcement-.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjcqsjp_4KBAxVptokEHTryCAwQFnoECAkQAg&usg=AOvVaw1qfY98RjO3sO6MesSA3Iqh\n\nThat is the tip of the iceberg.  There are some really good people taking some serious risks to smuggle footage out of China to show what is really going on on the ground.\n\nThe China situation very likely is not nearly what it appears on the surface, and there is a very good chance they could be rendered a non-threat economically.",

Given that base number is from the zero covet lockdown This additional observed decrease is basically catastrophic on a structural level.</p>\n\n<p>People have discussed possible kinetic military confrontation between the United States and China, more and more evidence is coming out that the United States may have handled the problem economically instead of via kinetic confrontation.</p>\n\n<p>It is not safe to make any projections about the economic component of any conflict at this point in time.</p>\n\n<p>The degree of the misinformation is just now being revealed with a headline that broke today:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/meta-disrupts-chinese-misinformation-network-linked-to-law-enforcement-.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjcqsjp_4KBAxVptokEHTryCAwQFnoECAkQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qfY98RjO3sO6MesSA3Iqh\">https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/meta-disrupts-chinese-misinformation-network-linked-to-law-enforcement-.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjcqsjp_4KBAxVptokEHTryCAwQFnoECAkQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qfY98RjO3sO6MesSA3Iqh</a></p>\n\n<p>That is the tip of the iceberg.  There are some really good people taking some serious risks to smuggle footage out of China to show what is really going on on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>The China situation very likely is not nearly what it appears on the surface, and there is a very good chance they could be rendered a non-threat economically.</p>\n</div>",

Sure, but far from a \"breach\" - it's located in just about the lowest ground in the whole sector, there are heights just North and (kinda) South of it, so it's would be a big ask of the UAF to consolidate this area without first significantly securing one of those two heights.

Anecdotally, three of my former friends welcomed the mobilization because they wanted to serve but couldn't get a contract - one was a draft dodger, the other grew up abroad and was past conscription age when he moved back to Russia, and the third one didn't want to quit his job. So when we consider this barrier of entry, is the number still small?\n\nIIRC towards the end of last year there were estimations going around indicating that pre-mobilization volunteers did number in the tens of thousands. So, let's take a conservative estimate of, say, 20000 volunteers over 6 months (March-August 2022). Is there any data to compare that against?

This includes automobiles and electronics. Overall manufacturing may appear to have barely declined due to the cushioning effect of increasing low-end manufacturing, but this reflects a deeper technological hole that Russia will continue to fall into with each passing quarter.\n\n- The central bank has done their best to sustain the ruble for 18 months. But the massive hole that it now finds itself in doesn't seem to be a temporary one. As this goes on, it'll be increasingly expensive to purchase not just finished products, but also intermediary goods. Which means much less quality goods over time, especially in scale.\n\nSanctioned regimes can indeed endure, but just not very well. In order to maintain regime stability, they usually need to much more oppressive. The thing is, Putin seems to be far less willing to pursue a truly totalitarian style of governance compared to states like NK, Cuba, and Iran. The key reasons may be that:\n\n- He's still restrained by the technically decentralized structure of the Russian Federation at a constitutional and legal level. He holds a lot of power, but just as his gaming of the presidency with Medvedev showed, he still has to operate within some constitutional limits.\n\n- Relatedly, he's likely afraid of pushing the boundaries too far should regional unrest spiral out of control. I don't ascribe to a 'Buryat/Tartar/Chechen uprising', but their unrest are things that he would still be concerned about. I reckon this paranoia has only increased since the Wagner mutiny.\n\nAll of this is to say: Yes, the sanctions are intended to degrade the Russian war effort, not to specifically instigate a popular uprising. But over time, this will affect popular sentiments. Moreover, if Russia suffers enough defeats on the battlefield (which the sanctions are meant to allow for over time), this would likely have a multiplicative effect on the comfort and apathy of the populace.",

This includes automobiles and electronics. Overall manufacturing may appear to have barely declined due to the cushioning effect of increasing low-end manufacturing, but this reflects a deeper technological hole that Russia will continue to fall into with each passing quarter.</p></li>\n<li><p>The central bank has done their best to sustain the ruble for 18 months. But the massive hole that it now finds itself in doesn&#39;t seem to be a temporary one. As this goes on, it&#39;ll be increasingly expensive to purchase not just finished products, but also intermediary goods.

            "body": "For a variety of reasons, ranging from accessibility to resources, Russia did not hit too many of the power *generation* facilities. Instead, they focused on the power transmission and some of the power distribution infrastructure, primarily taking out transformer substations. They also attempted to sever the Ukrainian power grid connections to the European power grid.\n\nTheir targets were numerous enough that it was extremely difficult for AA defense to cover all of them, especially as it was stretched very thin, and they host large, bulky, expensive equipment that's difficult to replace. However, they are also few enough that you can realistically target enough of them to make a difference, and they are critical for the functioning of the power grid. It's a little difficult to explain without this devolving into an intro to power transport but it's probably fair to think of them as analogous to airports for air shipping -- if they stop functioning, cargo planes don't have anywhere to land anymore and transport chokes, even though there's still plenty of cargo (electricity) to go around.\n\n\"Almost successful\" may not be the most helpful label but attacks on the power grid did have a significant impact. They had a major economic impact [1](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/economic-toll-attacks-ukraines-power-grid) and, in addition to the kind of suffering lack of electricity and heat usually causes, they had a significant death toll of their own [2](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/06/ukraine-russian-attacks-energy-grid-threaten-civilians).\n\nWhy they weren't fully successful is kind of a weasel question, as it's not immediately clear whta \"successful\" would've meant in the first place. If you walk around the, uh, smellier parts of Telegram, you'll see people insisting they were, in fact, a resounding success, as they caused widespread terror and suffering. In good Soviet fashion, others claim they were completely useless because they didn't force an immediate surrender. But assuming that the objectives of this massive campaign were a) to compromise Ukraine's ability to sustain economic activity in large urban centres and b) to make infrastructure reconstruction efforts incompatible with wartime activity, thus possibly forcing, if not a surrender, at least greater compromises during potential negotiations, it's probably fair to say that the campaign was, indeed, unsuccessful, and most of the reasons have to do with its scale and pace, but also with the inherently limited impact of such a campaign.\n\nFirst of all, its scale was simply insufficient. The Ukrainian power grid is in fact remarkably robust. Much of it was designed and built at a time when it was expected that Ukraine could be a major theatre of war. Russian propaganda channels vividly recounted how Iraq was bombed back to stone age, reducing its power generation capabilities to practically zero, but the Russian bombing campaign lacked both the scale (primarily on account of lacking the means) and the targeting of the Allied bombing campaign in Iraq. (See [here](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Dec/29/2001861964/-1/-1/0/T_GRIFFITH_STRATEGIC_ATTACK.PDF) for a very basic account of that, plus some useful historical references and bibliography). \n\n(A fun tangent: if you follow these things, it was kind of hilarious to see the mental gymnastics, too: Russian media is very big on how the criminal Western regimes caused widespread civilian death and suffering in Iraq and Serbia. However, for the duration of the infrastructure bombing campaign, they obviously had to shut up about that. This provided a pretty efficient mechanism to distinguish between \"independent\" and \"sponsored\" trolls: the latter would whatabout America into oblivion but carefully avoid the topic of bombing campaigns)\n\nUnlike the Gulf War campaign, the Russian bombing campaign had a limited impact over power generation facilities, and a significantly smaller impact over the power transmission. The Gulf War campaign reduced power generation capacity in Iraq to somewhere around 300 MW, or about half of *one* ZNPP unit's capacity, primarily by destroying power generation facilities. The massive attacks on the transport grid also reduced power transport capacity to about 25%. The Russian campaign failed to get anywhere close to these numbers.\n\nSecond, the pace of the attacks was, itself, insufficient. Transient defects in the power transmission grid are very difficult to manage. Their effects go way beyond merely cutting electricity to some consumers -- keeping the grid stable requires constant operation across all power generation and transmission facilities. Despite its large scale, the Russian bombing campaign consistently failed to generate sufficient disruption, at a high enough pace, to prevent basic grid operation from being restored.\n\nThat involved a lot of effort on the Ukrainian side ([1](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/world/europe/ukraine-war-infrastructure.html), [2](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/11547)). It did not help that, in addition to having a resilient power grid, Ukraine has an extraordinarily solid power engineering tradition, dating back to the age of the Soviet Union -- Ukraine hosted several nuclear power plants, some of the largest hydroelectric infrastructure projects of its age (e.g. on the Dniepr), and went through a massive electrification campaign. Their work was top notch.\n\nThis is not to say that the attacks were not extraordinarily disruptive. They were, and caused not just widespread death and suffering but also significant long-term damage to Ukraine's power transmission infrastructure. While the grid is fully operational at the moment, it's probably a good guess that some of the grid's resiliency may have been compromised.\n\nAFAIK there is no independent, detailed assessment of just what was destroyed and where. But based on extent of the blackouts it's a good guess that the campaign was close to substantially compromising the power transmission grid, to the point where it would've been impossible to bring it back to life with rockets flying around. Restarting the operation of a country-wide power grid is not as easy as flicking the \"on\" switches everywhere. (Re)connecting *a* power plant, or a local distribution network, is a complicated operation that takes hours (sometimes days) of concerted effort.\n\nFinally, the inferred objectives of the bombing campaign may simply have been unrealistic. There is a point that Griffith makes repeatedly in his report above, that the attacks on a country's power grid, even when they wreck greater havoc than what the Russian bombing campaign managed to inflict, produce only temporary and greatly limited military effect, and have a minor political impact compared to their effects over morale. The only area that they have a significant influence in is industrial production but some countries have managed to overcome even that if they could rely on foreign aid (a particularly ironic case of shortsightedness, considering that the main historical case study for this point is Soviet aid to Vietnam).\n\nThe bombing campaign also backfired politically, which added to its lack of military success. Personally, I was somewhat surprised that it got the green light, and I remember thinking that it must have been symptomatic of the strange rifts at the top of the Russian military command at the time. For all the shit he (deservedly) gets, Gerasimov is a politically astute observer who gets Western media far better than most of his peers. The infrastructure bombing campaign was one of the major factors that unlocked substantial air defense aid for Ukraine. No Western politician can keep a straight face when talking about the potential escalation risk of delivering defensive weapons against the background of children shivering in dark apartments on Christmas Eve. Even Orban had to shut up about how continuous Western aid contributes to suffering in Ukraine for a few weeks.\n\ntl;dr the campaign caused a great deal of destruction and suffering, but ultimately lacked the scale and pace required to obtain immediate and substantial strategic advantages, and caused enough public image damage that whatever temporary advantages it may have gained were offset by the damage it caused in the long run.\n\nSomewhat tangent, I suspect (but I must emphasise that this is purely my speculation) that Russian planners may have had over-inflated expectations about how quickly they could achieve the degree of disruption they were aiming for with the limited military means at their disposal. They had experience with disrupting the operation of the Ukrainian power grid, based on their notorious cyber attack a few years ago. Critically disrupting the power transmission grid is deceivingly straightforward when you look at a network map, God knows how often I played \"what if\" on maps like those with my colleagues back in my third year of uni. This campaign may have been the result of taking an older, better-established plan of critically compromising the Ukrainian power grid, and attempting to implement it by different and more limited means (primarily rocket and drone attacks).\n\nI was thinking of doing an effortpost about this bombing campaign back in May or so, but there's not *that* much public information available at the moment, my first draft ended up with more speculation than fact, and the like two courses I took on this subject were both too thin and far too long ago to be a solid enough base. Maybe some additional material has become available in the meantime, I should have a look...",

No Western politician can keep a straight face when talking about the potential escalation risk of delivering defensive weapons against the background of children shivering in dark apartments on Christmas Eve. Even Orban had to shut up about how continuous Western aid contributes to suffering in Ukraine for a few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr the campaign caused a great deal of destruction and suffering, but ultimately lacked the scale and pace required to obtain immediate and substantial strategic advantages, and caused enough public image damage that whatever temporary advantages it may have gained were offset by the damage it caused in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhat tangent, I suspect (but I must emphasise that this is purely my speculation) that Russian planners may have had over-inflated expectations about how quickly they could achieve the degree of disruption they were aiming for with the limited military means at their disposal. They had experience with disrupting the operation of the Ukrainian power grid, based on their notorious cyber attack a few years ago. Critically disrupting the power transmission grid is deceivingly straightforward when you look at a network map, God knows how often I played &quot;what if&quot; on maps like those with my colleagues back in my third year of uni. This campaign may have been the result of taking an older, better-established plan of critically compromising the Ukrainian power grid, and attempting to implement it by different and more limited means (primarily rocket and drone attacks).</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking of doing an effortpost about this bombing campaign back in May or so, but there&#39;s not <em>that</em> much public information available at the moment, my first draft ended up with more speculation than fact, and the like two courses I took on this subject were both too thin and far too long ago to be a solid enough base. Maybe some additional material has become available in the meantime, I should have a look...</p>\n</div>",
