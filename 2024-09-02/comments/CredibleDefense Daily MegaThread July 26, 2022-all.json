No where else in Crimea was on fire so it didn't appear to be wildfires. Since then I've noticed a few more new fires at those locations depending on the day. \n\nToday [this industrial train station area near Bakhchysarai](https://i.imgur.com/URzse2v.png) and the Gvardeyskoye naval airbase have fires again. I still haven't heard anyone talk about them, from osint communities to fire-map watchers on twitter. Has anyone read any discussions about what could be causing these fires?",

UA civilians will suffer worse than the Russians. And again, there is no telling how long the Russians will hold out for: after their primary escape route is lost. Days? Weeks? Months? How much food will they have stored? What about ammo?

There is no downside to winning the war for him politically, and plenty of downsides to a frozen status quo both at home and abroad. \n\nBut it\u2019s just not this easy, as people have been discussing here for months. The US has to be ready to fight in other contingencies, from the Baltics to Taiwan. It has limited stocks and restricted domestic production of many of the newest, best systems.

That was the main benefit of ATACMS a week ago, and it's the main benefit now.  Maybe the firepower Ukraine has been given is already enough to limit Russia's artillery potential (both directly and through interdicting logistics), but my argument is that it is not guaranteed.  Allowing them to hit logistical targets further away will reduce Russian artillery firepower further.  This is why I wanted ATACMS for Ukraine before, and why I want them now.

Because now you've claimed I've done a bunch of things I literally haven't, I've in many cases done the exact opposite.  How'd that work out for you?\n\n>ATACMS are not needed for Ukraine's survival\n\nWhich is your opinion that you still haven't even tried substantiating.  You could have probably done that instead of those paragraphs upon paragraphs of not actually addressing my point, you know.\n\nMy opinion is different - and I've substantiated it repeatedly to you.  You're yet to actually rebut it in any meaningful way, despite typing up a lot of text.  \n\n>which makes anything they say suspect since they are obviously not debating in good faith.\n\nMmm, that's one theory.  Personally someone who dedicates like the majority of several posts to just random attacks instead of trying to argue based on points and counterpoints is the one that comes off as debating in bad faith.

Like to break this down real simple: if you go to the clothes store and talk to Jenny, and ask her about a specific conversation you had with Jeremy, who is a different person, they might not be able to help you.</p>\n\n<p>In this case you&#39;re applying stuff that might describe someone, but not me, the person you&#39;re arguing with.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve previously expressed uncertainty that Russia is running out of steam (if anything, you seem to be more certain on that front than I am, though it&#39;s hard to tell since you&#39;re ducking that question).  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve further expressed uncertainty that Ukraine&#39;s current levels of firepower are going to have parity against Russia&#39;s.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve advocated for ATACMS to Ukraine before, during, and after Sullivan announced, and my reasons (as we&#39;ve explored before) haven&#39;t actually changed.</p>\n\n<p>All of this weeks ago and now.</p>\n\n<p>Which is probably why you should try arguing with the person you&#39;re arguing with instead of other people simultaneously.  Because now you&#39;ve claimed I&#39;ve done a bunch of things I literally haven&#39;t, I&#39;ve in many cases done the exact opposite.  How&#39;d that work out for you?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ATACMS are not needed for Ukraine&#39;s survival</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is your opinion that you still haven&#39;t even tried substantiating.  You could have probably done that instead of those paragraphs upon paragraphs of not actually addressing my point, you know.</p>\n\n<p>My opinion is different - and I&#39;ve substantiated it repeatedly to you.  You&#39;re yet to actually rebut it in any meaningful way, despite typing up a lot of text.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>which makes anything they say suspect since they are obviously not debating in good faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mmm, that&#39;s one theory.  Personally someone who dedicates like the majority of several posts to just random attacks instead of trying to argue based on points and counterpoints is the one that comes off as debating in bad faith.  Since you know, they&#39;re not even debating?</p>\n\n<p>Food for thought.</p>\n</div>",

It seems unlikely they can keep resupplying the forces needed to defend the city with pontoon bridges alone, and those pontoons will be much more vulnerable to artillery than the bridge.\n\nI think we are heading towards a situation where Russian forces in Kherson proper will have to choose whether to stay in the city and be cut off, surrounded by a hostile population, or to retreat to the NE, towards the crossing atop the dam at Nova Kakhovka (a bridge which would be much harder to destroy and which neither side wants to destroy since it is also a major dam).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: newer footage makes clear that basically the entire deck of the bridge has been compromised at the end where it was hit - [https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1552198832036913152](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1552198832036913152)\n\nI will leave the engineering assessments to more qualified people, but I have not seen a single bridge successfully repaired in this conflict such that it can support heavy equipment when it previously could not. I don't think we will see tanks, APCs, or military trucks using this bridge any time soon. At the moment it is impassible to anyone other than pedestrians.\n\nThis (and the previous strikes) seems to me to be a serious blow to Russian logistics in the entire region. The Antonivskyi Bridge supported two lanes of traffic in either direction, whereas the Nova Kakhovka dam is only one lane in each direction, with basically no shoulder. Besides that there is only a single rail bridge supporting the entire Russian presence on the Western side of the Dnipro.\n\nYes, Russia can build pontoons, but those cannot support the same kind of heavy traffic, and are even more vulnerable to artillery. And perhaps, theoretically, they could resupply via riverine forces, as some comments suggest. But they would have to deploy those forces onto the Dnipro first. I have yet to see much (any?) evidence of that. And they would have be be in *large* numbers to support the Russian forces on the West bank.\n\nTo be clear, I am not suggesting that this bridge being taken out means the entire West bank Russian force will retreat eastward. But I do think it compromises their forces in Kherson city and generally any forces they have west of the Inhulets River (which also has a limited number of crossing points, which have been targeted by Ukraine).

Even if at some point they create a gap - it can be easily bridged enough to meet military needs.\n\nI'm not a structural engineer, but having seen this [video](https://streamable.com/y7aplz) (if that is the right bridge), i'm not sure that the strikes aren't rendering it useless, or at least less useful. Even if they patched the holes, the rebar is badly damaged, enough of those holes will make the surface unstable to the point where I wouldn't drive a heavily laden truck across, let alone a tank.

The latter is directly in the city, making it easier to defend and harder to cut off. The Dam bridge is about as far from Kherson as can be, and around it seems to be fairly open terrain. That entire stretch of highway has to be defended, it's simply far more open to interdiction. It's not useless, but it's certainly less useful than the Antonovksy bridge.  \n  \n>Even if all the bridges are brought down the Russian artillery can easily support the defence of Kherson from the southern side of the river. Not to mention the air support.  \n  \nThis is certainly true, but it does severely limit the Russian artillery. They can only strike what is within reach from the southern side of the river. This gives Ukrainian artillery a lot more leeway to engage Kherson. At the same time, AD assets can move closer to Kherson.  \n  \n>Even if all the bridges are brought down the essential supply for the defenders of Kherson can easily continue using military ferries and boats. More than enough to provide ammunition and food and evacuate the wounded.  \n  \nThat's kind of a bold assumption. It's certainly not impossible, but it requires a lot more logistics.   \n1. You gotta drive the truck to whatever pier you have.  \n2. Then unload the truck (maybe by hand)  \n3. Load a boat, which carries different amounts than a truck, so you either underload and wait for another boat or even worse you can only transport part of what the truck brings, leaving the rest lying around.

Unload the boat at the next pier and   \n6. potentially load everything into other trucks to transport it. \nThis is a lot of overhead when compared to just driving a truck across a bridge.

We use USD as the global standard for denominating cost. Suppose both Russia and the US has a military budget of 100.000 USD, but while the US pays salaries in dollars, Russia does so in rubles and has a lower income level. Let's assume  20.000 USD pays a soldier's yearly salary in the US, whereas a Russian soldier is only paid the RUB equivalent of 10.000 USD. In nominal terms their budgets are equal, but in PPP terms Russia has twice the effective budget and twice the number of soldiers in reality.\n\nThe same applies to production, including military. Whether nominal or PPP is most relevant depends upon to what degree production depends on local input costs, ie. salaries, locally produced components, etc, and to what degree on on those sold at competitive international market prices. The Russian military-industrial complex is pretty self-sufficient and relies mostly on foreign producers for advanced tech like computer chips, but the problem there is sanctions and the supply bottleneck, not really prices. But yes, overall, a high nominal GDP means that it is relatively less costly for the UK to purchase 'advanced stuff' priced at international market prices relative to Russia, but PPP is still the main relevant comparison measure for military might.\n\nTo conclude, when comparing military opponents, nominal GDP is very relevant when the combatants source their military gear from foreign powers as opposed to sourcing it locally. The best recent example of this is the 2020 Armenian-Azerbaijani war in Karabakh. Azerbaijan has used its massive oil and gas wealth to purchase weapons from the West, Turkey and Russia, while Armenia has had to mostly make due with what limited arms it could afford and what support Russia was willing to give pro-bono. The difference in nominal GDP absolutely made a huge difference there.",

                "body": "> Ukraine only has a few HIMARS\n\nThey have 12 which give them the capability to launch 72 200lb precision guided bombs every day, assuming each one only sends one barrage per missile per day. A single rocket can level everything in a 50m radius. And it can go 90km behind Russian lines. So ~70km assuming a 20km buffer. All they need to do is program in GPS coordinates and the rocket does the rest.\n\nThat is FAR from a small weapon. If intel gets the location of 5 CPs and 5 ammo dumps per night, after 30 days, Ukraine can knock out 150 CPs and 150 ammo dumps. Without even breaking a sweat on those 12 HIMARs systems. They can also hit high value targets like S300s or radar installations. Each local or partisan will be reporting the locations of any of those weapons. \n\nBefore HIMARs, ukraine did not have that capability. Now they do. That marks a major shift in the ground warfare. And it has been way more effective than I had anticipated. \n\n> Will it be able to keep inflicting hugely disproportionate losses on Russians (Oryx 3.75 Russian loss : 1 Ukrainian loss up to this point) once it loses defender advantage? \n\nAside from me assuming the losses are probably 1:1 Russia to Ukraine, I actually don't think Russia will get much of a defenders advantage. The reason being that their forces are not there defending their homeland. Most of the locals want to shoot them. They don't know the area. And most of Russia's advantage has been based on their ability to employ superior fires, aka artillery and tanks. They move in, see where people are attacking from, call in artillery. Rinse and repeat. That is what has inflicted huge losses against the Ukrainians in the donbas earlier in the summer. \n\nNow, Ukraine can basically employ those exact same tactics, except Russia will have a MUCH harder time hiding from Ukrainians as the locals won't give them any protection. Also, most conscripts have zero motivation to be there, so when the big weapons (tanks, BTRs, artillery) fail, they just retreat. \n\nAnother aspect, Ukrainians were given NLAWs and Javelins like they were candy. Russia's best antitank weapon is very similar to the Stugna-P. Even as good as the Stugna-P was, it is not as effective as NLAWs and Javelin's for defense, especially in an urban environment. So Russians will not be as effective as Ukrainians in defense because they simply won't be as well supplied. \n\nGiven all that I laid out, Russians just sitting on the front line taking shits, eating food, and shooting their AK74s will slowly grind down and eventually retreat. Russia will need fresh troops and equipment from Russia in order to maintain their territory. And it's looking like that is getting more and more difficult for Russia as each day passes.",

Why were they making it a point to demonstrate they had the power to pressure Ukraine to make concessions, but just haven't decided to do it yet? Because they needed that in the message, because that comment defines the stakes. \n\nThe key to understanding this article's meaning is remembering that nothing that touches the main stream media in Wash DC is accidental. It's all coordinated, the media has been the chief political weapon in that city since it was founded. The Biden administration is CLOSELY allied with CNN, it's not remotely controversial to suggest that. They're basically partners. \n\nPut yourself in the shoes of the reporter. She is CNN's White House reporter covering national security, ergo when the White House wants an ally to publicly report anything they want involving national security and publish/produce it in a way fully endorsed by the Biden Administration, guess who gets the story? \n\nThere are at least half a dozen anonymous high placed White House and Congressional sources mentioned in the article, which means it was extremely coordinated and highly developed. They all went on the record with her too, they spoke with the authority of the administration. They remained anonymous because it's accredited to the Biden administration itself, that is the source's name that matters. And there was no retraction or angry counter a day later like other articles where Biden vented to another MSM outlet that he was pissed about leaks from an earlier one, which means this article had his administration's full blessing. \n\nSo this was 100% orchestrated, a public way to put the pressure on Zelensky's administration and the GenStab to get them sweat a bit. How do I know that? Because everything in the article could have been mentioned in private over the many weekly phone calls and zoom meetings, but the Biden administration chose not to.
