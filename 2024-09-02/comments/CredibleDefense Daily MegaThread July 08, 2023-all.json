I've never heard of anything else, memorizing formulas and algorithms is a very Soviet/Russian thing, they did it for everything from force ratios to knowing how many artillery rounds it takes to destroy just about any type of target (which this war totally invalidated). Being that the US Army is the one running the combined arms training for the UAF which is being done by US Army National Guard infantry BCTs (**not** armored BCTs), it seems odd they'd teach techniques to the Ukrainians that are foreign to the US Army, at least AFAIK.\n\nThe supposed UAF breaching tactics seem to take no consideration of Russian obstacles. \n\nHow can the recon probes find weak points in the Russian line if they're not even equipped to deal with mines, tank ditches, dragons teeth, wire? The Russian defensive positions are behind the minefields. If they want to keep their minefield locations secret they would have to engage UAF forces before they enter the minefields at max effective range of tank/ATGM fires plus artillery, but doing that gives away their firing location (resulting in suppression at least) as well as negating the benefits of an obstacle belt, which disrupt, fix, turn, or blocks the attacker, making them far more susceptible to fires.\n\nIt almost reads as if the UAF copied the Russian style spring-summer 2002 mounted AFV platoon sized \"recon by blundering\" tactics doing massed broad front probing with motorized rifle and tank platoons sent off to discover gaps by not getting blown the f*** up. I hope not, there are better ways of doing that...\n\nAnd why in God's name would the UAF be using technicals for recon? Pickup trucks have zero survivability against even AP mines, let alone anything bigger. The close range artillery shell that only scars a tank or IFV, maybe damaging some sensors or whatnot, would absolutely shred a pickup, not just catastrophically destroying the vehicle but turning the crew into ground meat. \n\nPlus, nowhere in the whole thing do they mention Ukrainian engineering support at all, which makes me doubt the validity of the captured document. We know the UAF are using lots of engineering equipment, to include dedicated engineering vehicles (including MICLIC) plus LOTS of mine plows attached to pretty much everything that will mount them. Besides dedicated engineering support (which should be at least a full engineer platoon for each breach) the allocation is one plow per tank platoon. \n\nThese tactics, as described, couldn't work in 1939.",

                            "body": "I think the Vietnamese, like the Chinese and Koreans too, had a shared tradition either from fighting the Japanese or learning from them. Funny enough, the Red Army was pretty good at night fighting, while at the same time most of the US Army and Marines were abysmal at it. During the Cold War, the Soviet army still dominated night fighting while prioritizing early night vision sights and what not, but the west passed them in the 70-80s thanks to cheap and reliable electronics the Soviet Union largely didn't have access to. \n\nSince then, US forces are pretty good at low light operations (though not as good as they think they are, outside of SOCOM units), mostly due to mass issuing of expensive equipment. Whereas the Ukrainians and Russians have far less of that expensive equipment, so aren't as reliant on it and less comfortable doing night ops. \n\nIt's possible to do offensive night ops without extensive use of night vision yourself, but only if the enemy doesn't have night vision equipment either. If they even have a little of it, as both Russia and Ukraine typically do, it would probably end as a slaughter to attack without everyone having NVGs and all the other pieces of equipment needed, plus solid standard operating procedures that everyone knows front to back. [This](https://youtu.be/cobI3ArpTb8) video does a little justice to what it's like attacking without the right equipment against an opponent who has it. When you can see in the dark and your opponent can't, it's like clubbing baby seals.\n\nBut then there are flares. Mortars and arty can both fire them continuously to illuminate the battlefield all night (the traditional way US forces conducted night ops before NVGs). Against an opponent who has night vision equipment and the defender doesn't, if the defender pops flares all night they'll blind most of the night vision equipment while giving the defender the ability to see and engage with the naked eye (though dancing shadows are annoying and creepy(. Flip it for the attacker, without extensive night vision equipment with the defenders having them, they can night into the day with flares. But if so, why not just attack during the day? Which is historically why the US didn't fight at night, we were more effective during daylight to spot targets and hit them with fires. \n\n>Many of their frontline assault infantry do have NVGs, \n\nAFAIK, outside SOF units, Ukrainians aren't mass issued NVGs. And that's not going to change (it took the US Army a full decade to become mass equipped with a very varying degree of night vision, it was HUGELY expensive, and was done specifically because of the realities of the GWOT). Without them being mass issued, their effectiveness is minimized. \n\nChances are they gave a few NVG or thermal imagers to every unit, who augment using optics from certain heavy weapons (especially ATGMs like Javelin or Stugna-P, though likely battery limits on both), and ISR drones that have that capability.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think the Vietnamese, like the Chinese and Koreans too, had a shared tradition either from fighting the Japanese or learning from them. Funny enough, the Red Army was pretty good at night fighting, while at the same time most of the US Army and Marines were abysmal at it. During the Cold War, the Soviet army still dominated night fighting while prioritizing early night vision sights and what not, but the west passed them in the 70-80s thanks to cheap and reliable electronics the Soviet Union largely didn&#39;t have access to. </p>\n\n<p>Since then, US forces are pretty good at low light operations (though not as good as they think they are, outside of SOCOM units), mostly due to mass issuing of expensive equipment. Whereas the Ukrainians and Russians have far less of that expensive equipment, so aren&#39;t as reliant on it and less comfortable doing night ops. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s possible to do offensive night ops without extensive use of night vision yourself, but only if the enemy doesn&#39;t have night vision equipment either. If they even have a little of it, as both Russia and Ukraine typically do, it would probably end as a slaughter to attack without everyone having NVGs and all the other pieces of equipment needed, plus solid standard operating procedures that everyone knows front to back. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cobI3ArpTb8\">This</a> video does a little justice to what it&#39;s like attacking without the right equipment against an opponent who has it. When you can see in the dark and your opponent can&#39;t, it&#39;s like clubbing baby seals.</p>\n\n<p>But then there are flares. Mortars and arty can both fire them continuously to illuminate the battlefield all night (the traditional way US forces conducted night ops before NVGs). Against an opponent who has night vision equipment and the defender doesn&#39;t, if the defender pops flares all night they&#39;ll blind most of the night vision equipment while giving the defender the ability to see and engage with the naked eye (though dancing shadows are annoying and creepy(. Flip it for the attacker, without extensive night vision equipment with the defenders having them, they can night into the day with flares. But if so, why not just attack during the day? Which is historically why the US didn&#39;t fight at night, we were more effective during daylight to spot targets and hit them with fires. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many of their frontline assault infantry do have NVGs, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>AFAIK, outside SOF units, Ukrainians aren&#39;t mass issued NVGs. And that&#39;s not going to change (it took the US Army a full decade to become mass equipped with a very varying degree of night vision, it was HUGELY expensive, and was done specifically because of the realities of the GWOT). Without them being mass issued, their effectiveness is minimized. </p>\n\n<p>Chances are they gave a few NVG or thermal imagers to every unit, who augment using optics from certain heavy weapons (especially ATGMs like Javelin or Stugna-P, though likely battery limits on both), and ISR drones that have that capability. But they&#39;d need enough for everyone or else they just blindly play the &quot;follow the leader&quot; game in file formation. Plus having everything else, like GPS or other fast ways for navigation and command and control, various types of IR beacons, chem lights, thermal sights, and all sorts of ammunition types (there are IR tracers, IR flares).

                "body": "The Twitter poster seems to be complaining about a lack of Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) doctrine needed to maximize the use of combat medics, citing blood transfusions as one procedure that if they could do them if they were allowed to save more lives, if the Ukrainians put more emphasis on it.\n\nEasier said than done. \n\nThe tweet mentions NATO militaries whose combat medics do those complex procedures, but that needs a caveat. We need to remember that most of NATO is shit, only a handful of top tier militaries whose combat medics can do that and only after attending over three months or more of top tier realistic, **expensive**, tough, and highly professional medical training before even getting to their units where they are near useless novices who still need years of additional advanced training to be really useful.\n\nI wasn't a medic when I was in the Army but I've never heard of a 68W private or Hospital Corpsman seaman doing blood transfusions with refrigerated whole blood. AFAIK, that's done at actual aid stations with physicians assistants or legit MDs in charge. The few locations where they might have done by enlisted personnel and not officers would be out of necessity due to inability to MEDEVAC, like in Afghanistan especially, by highly trained SOCOM medics (who are basically PA's) or NCOs/petty officers with a decade plus of advanced training and experience.\n\nThere is a great reason not to allow rank and file Ukraine combat medics to perform complex medical procedures in the field: most are barely trained. And as thousands of years of quackery medicine attests, experience with combat trauma doesn't mean jack in terms of improving, which requires legit training. \n\nAs the tweet even said, there is one combat medic school which only produces 300 graduates per month. Let's include more medics trained by foreign national PMC and NATO training, etc, the UAF still won't come close to ensuring they have enough well trained combat medics. Figure that every maneuver unit down to platoon is supposed to have a medic, and being at the tip of the spear they suffer heavy losses, that's a lot. Add in more medics (including NCOs) needed at the company level, medical platoons staffing aid stations at the battalion, medical companies at the brigade level, plus fully staffed combat hospitals at the higher unit levels, and that's a MASSIVE amount of combat medics needed.  That needs to be addressed first. They need more schools, and longer training at each school. \n\nIt's not supposed to be done outside of hospitals in Ukraine because that's traditionally where the actual trained medical providers are located, who also have the proper equipment, whole bloods, or the environment to find donors and do direct transfusions.

Good luck.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The Twitter poster seems to be complaining about a lack of Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) doctrine needed to maximize the use of combat medics, citing blood transfusions as one procedure that if they could do them if they were allowed to save more lives, if the Ukrainians put more emphasis on it.</p>\n\n<p>Easier said than done. </p>\n\n<p>The tweet mentions NATO militaries whose combat medics do those complex procedures, but that needs a caveat. We need to remember that most of NATO is shit, only a handful of top tier militaries whose combat medics can do that and only after attending over three months or more of top tier realistic, <strong>expensive</strong>, tough, and highly professional medical training before even getting to their units where they are near useless novices who still need years of additional advanced training to be really useful.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t a medic when I was in the Army but I&#39;ve never heard of a 68W private or Hospital Corpsman seaman doing blood transfusions with refrigerated whole blood. AFAIK, that&#39;s done at actual aid stations with physicians assistants or legit MDs in charge. The few locations where they might have done by enlisted personnel and not officers would be out of necessity due to inability to MEDEVAC, like in Afghanistan especially, by highly trained SOCOM medics (who are basically PA&#39;s) or NCOs/petty officers with a decade plus of advanced training and experience.</p>\n\n<p>There is a great reason not to allow rank and file Ukraine combat medics to perform complex medical procedures in the field: most are barely trained. And as thousands of years of quackery medicine attests, experience with combat trauma doesn&#39;t mean jack in terms of improving, which requires legit training. </p>\n\n<p>As the tweet even said, there is one combat medic school which only produces 300 graduates per month. Let&#39;s include more medics trained by foreign national PMC and NATO training, etc, the UAF still won&#39;t come close to ensuring they have enough well trained combat medics. Figure that every maneuver unit down to platoon is supposed to have a medic, and being at the tip of the spear they suffer heavy losses, that&#39;s a lot. Add in more medics (including NCOs) needed at the company level, medical platoons staffing aid stations at the battalion, medical companies at the brigade level, plus fully staffed combat hospitals at the higher unit levels, and that&#39;s a MASSIVE amount of combat medics needed.  That needs to be addressed first. They need more schools, and longer training at each school. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not supposed to be done outside of hospitals in Ukraine because that&#39;s traditionally where the actual trained medical providers are located, who also have the proper equipment, whole bloods, or the environment to find donors and do direct transfusions. The Twitter poster should have realized why the UAF top medical brass refused to allow it despite ignorant civilian politicians authorizing it (in terms of removing legal liability requirements), that is a good decision.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as SpaceX is formally known, and its representatives in Taiwan began urging government officials to change a law that requires any telecommunications joint venture to have local majority ownership of at least 51%, according to two officials who took part in the meetings. That insistence made Taiwan wary, they said.\n\n>SpaceX, which owns and operates Starlink, pushed for 100%, arguing Musk wanted to own the company outright because that\u2019s how he does business around the world, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions were private. Indeed in China, Tesla Inc.\u2019s most important market outside of the US, the electric carmaker wholly owns its factory in Shanghai, an anomaly in a country where other foreign automakers must have local partners.\n\n>The lobbying also came with an ultimatum: Unless Taiwan agreed to change its ownership rules, the island would get no deal at all.\n\n>SpaceX didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment over a period of weeks. Wu Tsung-tsong, minister of the island\u2019s National Science and Technology Council, which leads Taiwan\u2019s science, technology and space development, said Taiwan so far doesn\u2019t \u201cplan to amend the rules,\u201d although he added SpaceX would be welcome if there were a mutual compromise.\n\n>While talks have now broken down \u2014 SpaceX officials haven\u2019t spoken to Taiwanese government officials since September \u2014 Taiwan\u2019s vulnerability, along with Musk\u2019s significant financial stakes in China, are still playing high on many people\u2019s minds.\n\n>Senior US officials reiterated as recently as February that the US believes China wants its military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, although Taiwanese officials have downplayed the risk of invasion and there\u2019s no sign China is gearing up for war.\n\n>In February, the territory received a preview of what that might look like, when two subsea internet cables near the Taiwan-controlled Matsu Islands were severed by boats flying Chinese flags. About 14,000 residents spent more than 50 days suffering from painfully slow internet before Taiwan was able to repair the cables.\n\n>Taiwan would need to be ready to withstand a much more comprehensive attack on its digital lifelines in the event of a war with China, according to military historian David Silbey, director of teaching and learning at Cornell University\u2019s program in Washington, D.C.\n\n>\u201cYou cannot fight a conventional war if you cannot communicate with your troops by satellite communications,\u201d he said.\n\n>To address that vulnerability, the Taiwan Space Agency (TASA) intends to launch its first self-made low-Earth orbit communication satellite in 2026 and at least one more by 2028, Director General Wu Jong-shinn said. Taiwan also will have rockets capable of carrying payloads weighing over 100 kilograms, he added in an interview.\n\n>\u201cTaiwan\u2019s vision is to launch its homegrown rocket with a self-made satellite, with home-made ground equipment and satellite constellation,\u201d he said. \u201cBy that, we can safeguard our own country.\u201d\n\n>The agency has since 2019 operated six weather satellites in low-Earth orbit through its Formosat-7 program, a partnership with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n>Still, even NSTC\u2019s Wu admits that for Taiwan to build a minimum constellation of around 20 to 30 communications satellites, it would need \u201chelp from global companies or Taiwan\u2019s private sector.\u201d\n\n>That sort of scale is required because while newer low-Earth orbit constellations like the ones deployed by SpaceX, which travel at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers), can provide faster internet access than satellites in higher orbits, those low-Earth orbit networks need many more satellites to ensure a constant signal as they move across the skies.\n\n>Starlink\u2019s performance in Ukraine also caught the attention of China\u2019s military analysts.\n\n>In April last year, the Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications published a report acknowledging the satellite system would create \u201ca huge challenge for our current situational awareness and traditional defense capabilities.\u201d\n\n>In his comments to the Financial Times published in October, Musk said Beijing had \u201cmade clear its disapproval\u201d of the Starlink rollout in Ukraine to help the military circumvent Russia\u2019s severing of internet access. He added Beijing had sought assurances that he wouldn\u2019t sell the service in China.\n\n>Those sort of China vagaries worry politicians in Taiwan and beyond.\n\n>\u201cIf I\u2019m China, I would ask Elon Musk to control all the satellite receivers in Taiwan. If I can control him, in an emergency I can turn it off,\u201d Herming Chiueh, Taiwan\u2019s deputy minister of digital affairs, said. \u201cThat\u2019s my perspective, because we know China better than anyone else.\u201d\n\n>Lincoln Hines, a China space expert and assistant professor at the US Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama, agrees Taiwan has reason to be concerned.\n\n>\u201cCould Taiwan really count on the goodwill of Elon Musk in a crisis? That\u2019s a position not many countries would like to be in,\u201d he said.\n\n>Taiwan may also be pursuing military options with the US and other allies. The territory\u2019s Defense Ministry told Bloomberg the military has \u201cmultiple backups, with satellite as one of the measures,\u201d but added it doesn\u2019t \u201ccomment on details of war preparations.\u201d\n\n>With any Starlink deal in limbo, officials are searching for other alternatives, including seeking a workaround to the ownership laws.\n\n>In September, the territory\u2019s Ministry of Digital Affairs announced a proof-of-concept program that would allow satellite providers to operate in Taiwan on an emergency basis, without having to set up a new company or be bound by local ownership requirements\n\n>Taiwan\u2019s government opened the program to all the satellite providers, according to Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang. But SpaceX hasn\u2019t expressed interest, said Wu, from the National Science and Technology Council.\n\n>Regardless, Tang said her goal remains to set up 700 satellite receivers in and around Taiwan, using a \u201cplurality\u201d of satellite providers to avoid a single point of failure.\n\n>To that end, Tang and other officials have traveled to the US and the UK over the past year to meet with vendors.\n\n>The ministry is in discussions with Project Kuiper, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s satellite enterprise, and London-based OneWeb Ltd. has also signaled interest, Tang said. OneWeb plans to offer some coverage for Taiwan by the end of the year.\n\n>Meanwhile local electronics giant Foxconn Technology Group, best known as the maker of Apple Inc. iPhones, expects to launch its first low-Earth orbit communication satellite in the fourth quarter, Chairman Young Liu said in May.\n\n>And space development is one of President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s top priorities.\n\n>Her government in 2019 pledged to invest NT$25.1 billion ($803 million) in the sector over the next decade. Some 46 Taiwanese companies are already in the supply chain for Starlink and other global operators, and the territory aims to increase the output value of its space industry to NT$1 trillion by 2029, from NT$216 billion last year, according to TASA.",

In sheer average destructive potential, combat experience from Vietnam and Iraq has taught the US that 1 DPICM are roughly equivalent to 7 conventional HE rounds.

            "body": "Just some food for thought. \n\nRussian personnel losses in 2022 were severe, especially to junior leaders (company grade officers and NCOs) and its professional enlisted contract troops, but the September partial mobilization and other lesser \"shadow mobilizations\" done before and after have not only replaced those losses but allowed them to grow at least two times bigger than they were before the war started, possibly more. Quality dropped, but let's be real, whatever prewar quality the Russians had outside of the VDV airborne and MP naval infantry, it wasn't realistic to the demands of Ukraine, so it's possible to suggest they're better quality now than ever before (at least they seemed to have learned lessons from this war and applied them to training*).\n\nWhile they have been mobilizing mostly veterans with prior military experience, and giving them 2-3 months of training (not even good let one great), I'm still at a loss how they created more company grade officers. My guess is they're back to the old school WW2 approach where anyone who shows any competence or intelligence is directly commissioned, though they'd need to seriously dumb down responsibilities and tactics for company and platoon level especially.** \n\nNobody mentions them now but I wonder what happened to the Refuseniks after the partial mobilization. All enlisted and officers serving in Ukraine prior to the laws changing in Sep '22 served on contracts that included a clause that allowed them to resign at any time without retribution. Like the law that banned conscripts from serving in foreign conflicts outside of a declared war, that was another stupid restriction nobody thought about the consequences of because they figured if they got into a major war then they'd declare it as such, instead of keeping it legally defined as a \"Special Military Operation.\" Amazing enough, unit losses to Refuseniks were even higher than combat losses, no surprise since it takes a patriotic fool to stick around voluntarily to fight in Ukraine when the option to leave whenever exists. Those were prime fodder to forcibly mobilize again.\n\nThe use of prison convict volunteers as disposable infantry both sickens me and yet is quite interesting. Typical in western militaries, casualties incurred performing difficult tasks are shared. Not by job, the infantry always bare the great brunt, but in most militaries the infantry units share the dangerous and bloody jobs out so no one unit gets unfairly stuck doing them. While that's fair it's bad too, as it means all units, even the really effective, good ones, are going to have to take a beating and suffer heavy losses doing missions that will guarantee heavy losses, which then erode their future effective (see Huertgen Forest). But what if there was another option? In WW2 the Germans and the Red Army used penal battalions for those missions, which not only served a purpose (rehabilitation of bad troops), served as a disciplinary deterrent for the larger force, but allowed them to preserve their better units especially so they didn't need to get fed into meat grinder as regularly. Think about the absolute audacity it took for Prigozhin to make that call in 2022. Which worked so well the Russian MOD hijacking that recruitment program for their own use. As bad as it is ethically, wholly shit is it effective at preserving the better force structure, as [this horribly formatted BBC article attests](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-829ea0ba-5b42-499b-ad40-6990f2c4e5d0).\n\nBesides combat arms personnel, the next big loss was ground combat equipment, especially it's supply of IFV and tanks, as well as better SPG arty. The former is a big deal, while everyone talks about the tanks and using modernized T55 or T62 (which isn't even that big of a deal considering they're most doing long range fires in lieu of artillery), but the Russians lost most of their BMP-3s and BTR-80M and 90Ms, stuck using older shittier models that do need to move up closer to Ukraine forces, especially on the attack. That said, they're less reliant on armor than ever before thanks to the strengthening of their dismounted infantry from mobilization and convict recruitment. \n\nAs for winter offensive losses, as that BBC article shows, the losses weren't equally spread. Most were Wagner and most of those were inmates. Of the rest, far fewer were of the better Russian personnel, who've they've been able to preserve using their heinous methods.\n\nWhat this war is showing us is the depths that Russia will go through to not only trying to win, but also to laughably not escalate their Special Military Operation into an actual war. \n\n\n*While I'm sure the UAF are learning lessons and disseminating them to all units, I'm not sure training is reflecting it, especially that provided by NATO, which [isn't](https://warontherocks.com/2023/06/what-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-need-to-do-to-win/) at all standardized and is based on the hosting military's doctrine, not Ukraine's. \n\nFor example, to teach the Ukrainians combined arms maneuver warfare, the US Army are using [Army National Guard](https://www.army.mil/article/266292/arkansas_national_guard_unit_assumes_command_of_joint_multinational_training_group_ukraine) of infantry brigades (aka no tankers or IFV crew organic to the unit). Despite the trainers not being experts on mechanized warfare, the training is done using US vehicles that the Ukrainians largely won't be issued ([Bradley IFV](https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-army/2023/02/17/ukrainian-battalion-completes-first-combined-arms-training-in-germany/)), using overly simplified bread and butter US Army tactics, techniques and procedures literally right out of the field manual, not reflective of what the Ukrainians will use or how they will be actually expected to perform in combat (which likely needs to be learned during the 1-3 months of time units have to do more collective training before they join the offensive. \n\nI'm not sure how the Russians are doing it but it would be challenging to be as batshit as NATO training. \n\n**All prewar Russian junior lieutenants serving as platoon leaders received 4-5 years of academy training that was much more technical focused than US military service academies, with new junior lieutenants supposed to take charge and fully train and supervise their platoons without senior NCO support and mentoring like in modern Western militaries, more like WW2 era US Army, which had a far less empowered or professional NCO corps as it does now. Without extensive training of junior leaders will be incapable of advanced tactics, techniques and procedures, with experience not helping much since they'll likely become casualties before they become proficient.

[Leaks revealed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/22/us/politics/ukraine-western-weapons-supplies.html) that back in early March, about the same time they ignored US recommendations to retreat from Bakhmut, they were down nation wide to a total artillery stockpile of about ~9k rounds (about two days worth). That resulted in multiple emergency airlifts and more ammo given over time, but it wasn't a lot. \n\nThen the UAF great summer strategic offensive started and, in all honesty, after a month plus they haven't accomplished much. Which is to be understood because there are no real weak points to attack. However, whatever they have stockpiled in terms of artillery cant have been enough to grind away for 2-4 more months to attrit the Russians purely by arty to achieve something decisive enough to claim victory without much much much more ammo. \n\n**LOTS MORE AMMO**\n\nWhich can't be provided in the amount Ukraine will need to indulge in fires centric operations to outshoot the Russians (from 4-7k/day to 20-30k/day). The US stockpile is too limited to risk spending much of it on Ukraine (this war identified how low our own stockpiles were), Europe doesn't have it, other countries that do (Israel, Turkey, and South Korea) only have so much they're willing to give up. And production won't catch up anytime soon.\n\nSo where are there literally millions of artillery and other shells sitting around collecting dust that the owners don't even want? (And are only sitting around because it's too expensive to destroy them rapidly) And aren't those shells known to the Ukrainians who have been asking for them for at least half a year?\n\nUkraine needs at least many hundreds of thousands more artillery shells immediately or this offensive fails. And if this offensive fails then that means everything given in the last seven months has been a waste. It means Biden's effort to defeat Russia has failed. It means a stalemate in Ukraine at best, and a potential peace deal where Putin wins part of Ukraine because they can't retake it militarily anyway. \n\nIt was either that or potentially take flak from his base.

That resulted in multiple emergency airlifts and more ammo given over time, but it wasn&#39;t a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Then the UAF great summer strategic offensive started and, in all honesty, after a month plus they haven&#39;t accomplished much. Which is to be understood because there are no real weak points to attack. However, whatever they have stockpiled in terms of artillery cant have been enough to grind away for 2-4 more months to attrit the Russians purely by arty to achieve something decisive enough to claim victory without much much much more ammo. </p>\n\n<p><strong>LOTS MORE AMMO</strong></p>\n\n<p>Which can&#39;t be provided in the amount Ukraine will need to indulge in fires centric operations to outshoot the Russians (from 4-7k/day to 20-30k/day). The US stockpile is too limited to risk spending much of it on Ukraine (this war identified how low our own stockpiles were), Europe doesn&#39;t have it, other countries that do (Israel, Turkey, and South Korea) only have so much they&#39;re willing to give up. And production won&#39;t catch up anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>So where are there literally millions of artillery and other shells sitting around collecting dust that the owners don&#39;t even want? (And are only sitting around because it&#39;s too expensive to destroy them rapidly) And aren&#39;t those shells known to the Ukrainians who have been asking for them for at least half a year?</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine needs at least many hundreds of thousands more artillery shells immediately or this offensive fails. And if this offensive fails then that means everything given in the last seven months has been a waste. It means Biden&#39;s effort to defeat Russia has failed. It means a stalemate in Ukraine at best, and a potential peace deal where Putin wins part of Ukraine because they can&#39;t retake it militarily anyway. </p>\n\n<p>It was either that or potentially take flak from his base. Notice what day of the week this was announced? Hint, <a href=\"https://politicaldictionary.com/words/friday-news-dump/\">Friday wasn&#39;t a coincidence</a>.</p>\n</div>",

It has the most powerful radar and sensor/EW suite ever put in a plane as well as the most advanced avionics, combined with being extremely stealthy (perhaps even stealthier than an F-22 now with improved RAM coatings) making it pretty much certain to win any BVR engagement with an enemy aircraft. Its greatest strength however may be its ability to network and share target data with other assets on its side (not just other aircraft, it can do so with ship-based Aegis or ground units like HIMARS for instance) allowing these assets to attack targets that they may not be able to target on their own.\n\nNow a lot of Russian commenters make claims that fall apart pretty quickly when analyzed by anyone with any kind of knowledge about this stuff. I've heard claims like \"Su-35 can target it with IRST\" which is true to some extent but it's not very relevant since the F-35's AN/APG-81 can target a non stealthy aircraft from *well* outside IRST detection range (F-35 also has IRST as well), and the F-35 is very stealthy in the IR spectrum from the front. I've also heard the claim that F-35 would lose in a WVR engagement. It's highly unlikely an F-35 would find itself in such an eng engagement to begin with, but even if it did it would most likely still have the advantage. The pilot is fitted with an HMD visor which allows her to see through her aircraft in any direction and target anything she's looking at. AIM-9X's HOBS capabilities would even allow for an aircraft on the F-35's 6 o'clock to be shot down. Kinematically, it's still a very impressive fighter perhaps even on par with the F-16. Russian aircraft seem to prioritize post-stall maneuverability over energy maneuverability like American aircraft, which has little use in a real life dog fight. Add to that Russia's constant exaggeration of its capabilities and America's constant downplaying of its capabilities and I have no doubt in my mind that nothing Russian could pose any real threat to an F-35 squadron",

Perhaps that&#39;s why the entire sub was surprised by the Feb invasion and we constantly can read Russia appeasing opinions which will lead to more bloodshed in the region.</p>\n\n<p>We are living in a interim era, similar to pre WWI and WWII (or rather more akin to Napoleonic wars) that will shape the life of humankind for few decades. Time to act is now, not entertain flawed strategies/idea that led us where we are.</p>\n</div>",
