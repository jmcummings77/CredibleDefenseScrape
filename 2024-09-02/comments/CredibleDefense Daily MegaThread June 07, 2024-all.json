Self-propelled 155 mm artillery system with NATO Joint Ballistic Memorandum of Understand (JBMoU) compatibility ammunition and charge system. The acquired entity will contain 16 artillery systems +/- 4 systems, depending on the funding provided. In addition, options for years 2029-2031 will be requested for 6 systems depending on the quantity to be acquired. The aim of the procurement is to create a mobile artillery capability for coastal defence forces in order to engage vessels in Finnish territorial waters at the littoral area including the archipelago and hostile forces on land. The system shall have a high degree of mobility enabling deployment in the operational environment. The primary operational environment for the system is the Finnish coastal area.",

This number was revised later to three women, nine children and 21 men.\n\n>The hospital initially reported that nine women and 14 children were among those killed in the strike on the school. The hospital morgue later amended those records to show that the dead included three women, nine children and 21 men. It was not immediately clear what caused the discrepancy. An Associated Press reporter had counted the bodies but was unable to look beneath the shrouds.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-6-6-2024-3d07e712f8abc1e08339163180823fb8](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-6-6-2024-3d07e712f8abc1e08339163180823fb8)\n\nThe Israelis then published a initial list of 9 Hamas operatives they claim to have killed in the strike:\n\n>These are the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists we eliminated last night during a precise strike who were operating from the U.N. school:\n\n[https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1798799730148827255](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1798799730148827255)\n\nToday the Israeli released another list of 8 Hamas operatives they claim to have killed in the strike:\n\n[https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1799127791742623981](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1799127791742623981)\n\nA Israeli OSINT activists combed through social media to identify the casualties.

This strike was carried out in Northern Gaza. This time the Israelis immediately published a explanation. Likely so they could get before the media and prevent the release of unverified casualty statistics. \n\n>We eliminated Hamas terrorists in a precise IAF strike while they were operating in a container inside the premises of an UNRWA school in Shati earlier today.  \n  \nThe terrorists carried out terrorist attacks from the U.N. school premises while using it as a shield for their terror activities.

As I said then, I feel he is too hyperbolic. He's filling a need, but not \"our need\". \n\nTake the example of him saying we're already in (a prelude to) WW3. It's exactly the right way to phrase it to a YouTube audience, but it makes no sense when you analyse it at a lower level. World wars happen between near-peer adversaries, and the West does not have one (yet.) We're in an information world war for sure, but now we're back to hyperbole.\n\nTo be clear, I do respect Ryan, but I'm not going to mince words when talking about detractors.   \nAlso, I have to say my respect fell when he showed her isn't just blusterous, but thin-skinned as well. Crying to your fan-base about \"haters\" is *ridiculous*.",
