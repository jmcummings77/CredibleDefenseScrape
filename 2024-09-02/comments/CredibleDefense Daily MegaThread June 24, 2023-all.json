      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Unfortunately, I have no way of sharing the podcast in a publically available manner, but the key points are below. \n\nMichael Kofman is the Director of Russia Studies at CNA and a Senior Adjunct Fellow at CNAS.\n\n**Summary of Events**\n\n-Almost exactly 24 hours ago, it looked like Prigozhin's conflict with the MOD had reached a boiling point, when he announced a march on Moscow, demanding the resignation of Shoigu and Gerasimov. \n\n-The Russian government moved quickly to shore up its ranks, releasing public statements from within the Russian military(General Surovikin) and Russian government(FSB) against the coup\n\n-Most of Wagner was likely not at the front when the announcement was made. They were likely in training camps in Luhansk. This facilitated a very quick advance into Rostov-on-Don and the Southern Military District headquarters located therein. \n\n-Most Russian units stood by due to chaos and confusion, as well as the perception of Wagner forces as friendly units.\n\n-By morning, a relaxed \"standoff\" had developed between Wagner and MOD forces in the city, with some Wagner and infantry pointing guns at the SMD building while others drank coffee or smoked cigarettes.\n\n-This was not bloodless. Wagner was bombed by SU-34s and took down several aircraft themselves. **Wagner may have done more damage to Russian aviation than Ukraine has in the past month.**\n\n-Kofman cannot imagine that this ends here. \n\n**Analysis**\n\n-**Prigozhin is clearly getting desperate and running out of options, but he may understand something about Shoigu and the regime that we do not as outside observers.** Prigozhin saw that Shoigu was weak, that the regime was far more hollow than it looks, and that he had the opportunity to launch this attack and extract concessions even when from the outside it looked pretty futile.\n\n-**Even if Prigozhin is talking about Shoigu and Gerasimov, this is a coup against Putin. It is Putin's power that is being challenged here.**\n\n-Wagner's forces were let through unopposed likely due to confusion and stupidity rather than as a show of support. \n\n-Coup failed to generate support from elites within the system. Clearly, key security systems(FSB) were on the side of the regime.\n\n-Prigozhin's timing is terrible. the Russian army is clearly doing better defensively than most had expected, sapping some of the weight from his arguments. \n\n-Most coups fail very quickly and early on. Russia in particular does not have a good history of successful military coups.\n\n-If Prigozhin walks out of this with a deal and his head, we will have learned a lot about Russia in the past 24 hours.\n\n-Personalist authoritarian systems must prevent alternatives from emerging. A coup-proofing system emerges from this. Whether or not he was under a delusion about it, what Prigozhin did was a challenge to that system. Based on what Kofman saw in Rostov-on-Don, the performance of that system was not encouraging. \n\n-Wagner's regime ties may be through the GRU, and the FSB was likely opposed to its existence. FSB is likely to send an \"I told you so\" message to Putin.\n\n-Probably 1500-2000 Wagner forces crossed the border with Prigozhin. The forces that entered Rostov-on-Don looked like two companies worth. Prigozhin is overstating the size of Wagner overall(not 15,000, and certainly not 25,000). \n\n-Prigozhin planned this, but he was also pushed to this by RUMOD ultimatums that would mean the functional destruction of Wagner(forcing Wanger soldiers to sign contracts with military). **Russia made the mistake of pushing Prigozhin into a desperate act while also not preparing for that act.** Very stereotypical of the competence level of this regime.\n\n-Wagner troops are going to be fine, they are going to be given a general amnesty for this. Putin clearly and publically put the blame on Prigozhin, not his soldiers.\n\n-If Kofman was Prigozhin, he would not trust that deal for a minute. If RUMOD is using this deal to buy time to mobilize their forces, this will not go his way. \n\n-This could have been the beginning. If this had gone on for more than a day, it could have catalyzed the disintegration of the regime as a whole. \n\n-Key questions: Will Wagner abandon their main bargaining chip, Rostov? What are troops and commanders on the front lines thinking about what's going on back home? What was Prigozhin's theory of victory, and why did he turn back? Does he understand the full implications of what he did?\n\nPS: There was a publicly available War on the Rocks podcast with Kofman that got published earlier today as well. It predates Prigozhin's push, but there are still some interesting takes in there about the state of Ukraine's counteroffensive, and I don't think anyone has shared it here yet: https://warontherocks.com/2023/06/ukraines-offensive-and-russias-localized-counterattacks/.\n\nEdit: my comment got removed, u/KronoriumExcerptC, so I\u2019ve pasted it here:\n\n>Sure! The exact quote is:\n\n>>And by the way, this is, in many cases, a traditional coup, if you don\u2019t see it that way, because he\u2019s fundamentally challenged Putin\u2019s power. Even if he\u2019s talking about Shoigu and Gerasimov, which I think realistically everyone in the Russian military would like to get rid of anyways. This isn\u2019t a fight between Prigozhin supporters and Shoigu supporters. This is a fight between him[Prigozhin] and the regime.",

            "body": "I've seen reports of assaults continuing to chip away at Russian positions around Marinka, as well as limited offensives by both sides in the north around Kupyansk and Kremmina and in the south near the Donetsk/Zaporizhzhia border and in the west near Orikhiv. Things were quiet around Bakhmut on both sides. Also there have been continuing Ukrainian interdiction strikes against high value targets at operational depths. So the same sorts of small back and forth tactical movements we've been seeing for weeks now, with the Ukrainians pounding critical Russian logistics nodes and other HVTs in the rear areas. One interesting milestone that has seemingly gone unnoticed in the media is that the Ukrainians appear to have retaken ground on the other side of the 2014 borders for the very first time just to the southwest of Krasnohorivka, which is north of Marinka in Donestk Oblast. \n\nThis is purely speculative, but if I were Syrsky, I would have put any planned major operations yesterday on temporary hold to see how the Prigozhin affair played out, for two main reasons. First, in the hopes that it would open up a new weakness in the Russian lines or otherwise improve the odds of the operation succeeding, or possibly even the odds of it becoming altogether unnecessary should the Russians withdraw voluntarily to deal with their own internal power struggles. Second, out of fear that any major Ukrainian victory would have provoked an immediate reconciliation between Putin and Prigozhin in face of the greater external threat before Prigozhin had time to cause more extensive damage to the Russian war effort. Simultaneously, the UAF would not want to let up pressure on the front, because that would give the Russian troops at the front time to reset. Hence the continuing probes and rear area strikes. One could argue that they should have attacked during the chaos, but I don't think the rear area disruptions had enough time to percolate down the chain-of-command to affect front line troops yet, so waiting for that to happen rather than striking immediately would make sense. \n\nSo from that perspective, it's somewhat unsurprising that nothing much of note happened on the front over the last 24 hours. I mean, imagine if Prigozhin had seized the Kremlin and the RuAF had been forced to retreat from Ukraine back to Russia in order to settle internal power struggles. It would be difficult to justify wasting Ukrainian lives on difficult breaching assaults when it was very possible that the assaults would be rendered unnecessary by just waiting a day or two.",

And yes, while Belgorod raids are no fun for Putin either, a couple of dozen raiders at the border regions are nothing compared to what we had here. Once the fighting would\u2019ve escalated, I can\u2019t see how you can expunge 5k-25k motivated and professional soldiers from major urban centers without leveling city blocks. You can\u2019t suppress it on the internet or the TV, people would know instantly.\n\nAnd, despite what one might think about Putin regime, he is extremely reliant on the illusion of unity from the masses. Once it breaks \u2013 it opens him up too many nasty things like internal, behind the closed doors coups, or pressure to end the war, or even not so internal coups like the one we had pleasure witnessing yesterday. There is way too much risk in that.\n\nI believe de-escalation was a paramount objective of Putin, and it explains why Wagner forces encountered almost no resistance on their way or in Rostov. Listen, I love clowning on Kadyrov TikTok squad as much as the next guy, but there is only one credible explanation on why there was no fighting in Rostov despite Akhmat arriving there at around 16PM Moscow time. They had orders not to engage. From what I\u2019ve gathered, most of the aviation losses occurred at the start of it all and can be explained by the general bumblefuckery of panicked armed forces. Once Prigozhin stopped updating his telegram at about 15pm Moscow time, there were almost no new reports of fighting at all. It\u2019s easy to assume that he started to negotiate at this point.\n\nWhat motivated Prigozhin to start it all and what motivated him to stop \u2013 I doubt anyone who does not actively engage in Kremlin Byzantinian court politics knows. Maybe he was hopeful more people would join him, or maybe he was really thinking Putin can cave in to his demands. Not sure if the \u201cWho won/who lost\u201d line of thinking is even applicable here. \n\nOverall, the event showed a crack in the regime that we have never seen before. I\u2019m sure seeing people cheer on Wagner, or thousands likes on his post in TG changed some people\u2019s minds about the strength and stability of the regime. We were a couple of hours away from opening Pandora box, and finding out how stable Putin really is. \n\nAt the same time the regime avoided worst case scenario here, so I can\u2019t designate them as \u201closers\u201d either. One thing for sure \u2013 that was a historic event that could pave the way to the destruction of the regime in the future.",

Apparently we are not there yet cause &#39;West is weak and will stop supporting Ukraine in no time&#39; or this war is &quot;existential to Russia&quot; somehow. Literally fighting it is a risk to Russian existence/statehood in current the form which was proved e.g. yesterday.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "I think Prigozhin ***may*** have escaped with his life and the core structure of Wagner intact solely because of how successful Prigozhin and Wagner Group are.\n\nWagner Group was responsible for the only real military success during the Russian winter-spring offensive on the Soledad and Bakhmut axis. I\u2019ve said this before, but compare Wagner to the Russian MOD commanded \u201celite\u201d Naval Infantry BDEs and newly constituted III Corps in Vuhledar. The MOD commanded troops were thrown into Ukrainian minefields and fortifications over and over again -for nothing. While Wagner\u2019s human wave tactics in Bakhmut weren\u2019t much better from a humanitarian perspective, at least they were effective and Wagner captured its intended objective before the Russian offensive culminated last month. All through this episode, Prigozhin himself gave a voice to Russian troops on his frustration with RU MOD incompetence in running the war. Whether that frustration was real, imagined, manufactured -whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter because it made Prigozhin a folk hero amongst many of the Russian military rank and file as well as many of the hardliners inside Russian society. He got as far as he did because many in the Russian military let him. While leaving the Southern Military District HQ, some civilians even embraced him. Killing him now or later would likely only make him a martyr. Even worse for the RU MOD and Putin, factionalism can\u2019t be used as a scapegoat in the future of Russia suffers further losses, it\u2019ll fall squarely at the feet of the Russian Military leadership since all PMCs are now being incorporated into the RU MOD.\n\nFurther, Wagner- thanks to its overseas activities in the Middle East, Africa, and South America is far too useful for the Russian state to lose as an asset. Wagner provides \u201cdeniability\u201d for Russian interests abroad. Not only that, Wagner is profitable, with a self sustaining business model based on security contracting and resource exploitation. Lastly, they\u2019re able to provide expertise that the Russian military just isn\u2019t able to offer. Why would Wagner\u2019s core experienced cadre serve a contract in the RU MOD being paid a poor man\u2019s salary when they could be making so much more under Wagner- and actually being used effectively as \u201cmop up\u201d troops or overseas rather than being wasted in costly frontal assaults that amount to nothing?\n\nI think Wagner\u2019s time in Ukraine -for now- is over. But for Prigozhin, I think he may have actually \u201cwon\u201d (if he survives). He just identified his most loyal and committed troops by staging the mutiny. All the soldiers that participated have been granted amnesty- they\u2019ll likely go on with Prigozhin to set up HQ for their overseas empire in Belarus and form the new core of his most trusted and loyal cadre. Since Belarus and Russia are a \u201cUnion State\u201d they\u2019ll likely continue serving the interests of the Russian state overseas from there. And now, that Prigozhin has positioned himself as a hero of Russian soldiers who stuck it to the Russian MOD, he\u2019ll be free to recruit Russians dissatisfied with the Russian military and maybe even Putin and the Russian state apparatus, and he\u2019ll build up his forces again. \n\nNow that\u2019s all if everything goes to plan. The way things are, I don\u2019t think Putin *can* kill him. I think this whole event shook him with how close Wagner got to the capitol, how easily Russian units/security at the front, in Rostov, and in Voronezh essentially got out of his way, and again just how much support he had amongst the rank and file, some civilians, and maybe even amongst an unseen 5th column inside the Russian state.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think Prigozhin <strong><em>may</em></strong> have escaped with his life and the core structure of Wagner intact solely because of how successful Prigozhin and Wagner Group are.</p>\n\n<p>Wagner Group was responsible for the only real military success during the Russian winter-spring offensive on the Soledad and Bakhmut axis. I\u2019ve said this before, but compare Wagner to the Russian MOD commanded \u201celite\u201d Naval Infantry BDEs and newly constituted III Corps in Vuhledar. The MOD commanded troops were thrown into Ukrainian minefields and fortifications over and over again -for nothing. While Wagner\u2019s human wave tactics in Bakhmut weren\u2019t much better from a humanitarian perspective, at least they were effective and Wagner captured its intended objective before the Russian offensive culminated last month. All through this episode, Prigozhin himself gave a voice to Russian troops on his frustration with RU MOD incompetence in running the war. Whether that frustration was real, imagined, manufactured -whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter because it made Prigozhin a folk hero amongst many of the Russian military rank and file as well as many of the hardliners inside Russian society. He got as far as he did because many in the Russian military let him. While leaving the Southern Military District HQ, some civilians even embraced him. Killing him now or later would likely only make him a martyr. Even worse for the RU MOD and Putin, factionalism can\u2019t be used as a scapegoat in the future of Russia suffers further losses, it\u2019ll fall squarely at the feet of the Russian Military leadership since all PMCs are now being incorporated into the RU MOD.</p>\n\n<p>Further, Wagner- thanks to its overseas activities in the Middle East, Africa, and South America is far too useful for the Russian state to lose as an asset. Wagner provides \u201cdeniability\u201d for Russian interests abroad. Not only that, Wagner is profitable, with a self sustaining business model based on security contracting and resource exploitation. Lastly, they\u2019re able to provide expertise that the Russian military just isn\u2019t able to offer. Why would Wagner\u2019s core experienced cadre serve a contract in the RU MOD being paid a poor man\u2019s salary when they could be making so much more under Wagner- and actually being used effectively as \u201cmop up\u201d troops or overseas rather than being wasted in costly frontal assaults that amount to nothing?</p>\n\n<p>I think Wagner\u2019s time in Ukraine -for now- is over. But for Prigozhin, I think he may have actually \u201cwon\u201d (if he survives). He just identified his most loyal and committed troops by staging the mutiny.

Because we went with a March for Justice. We were hit, first with artillery, then with helicopters. We went without a single round fired, we didn\u2019t touch a single conscript. We didn\u2019t kill a single person on our way. We were attacked by aviation, helis, planes, but we reached Rostov. Without a single round, we captured the building of the HQs. We didn\u2019t interfere with the work of a single person.*\n\n*On the streets, people are unfurling flags of PMC Wagner.

Putin was planning to invade Ukraine.In this case, the information was considered both solid and alarming because of the possibility that a major nuclear-armed rival of the United States could descend into chaos.\n\nWhile it is not clear exactly when the United States first learned of the plot, intelligence officials conducted briefings on Wednesday with the administration and defense officials. On Thursday, as additional confirmation of the plot came in, intelligence officials informed a narrow group of congressional leaders, according to officials familiar with the briefings who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. By Friday night, Prigozhin had dramatically escalated his feud, launching a march on Moscow that the Russian government described as an attempted coup. On Saturday, he called his fighters off and agreed to flee to Belarus after a day of tumult.\n\nFor months, intelligence officials have tracked rising tensions between Mr. Prigozhin and leaders of Russia\u2019s defense ministry, including Sergei K. Shoigu, the minister of defense.Intelligence reports released as part of the Discord leaks showed that the United States had intercepted communications between senior Russian military leaders debating how to handle Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s constant demands for more ammunition.\n\nMost of those tensions played out in public, as the leader of the mercenary military group used interviews and Telegram posts to berate Mr. Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces, calling them incompetent and charging that they misled Mr. Putin about the progress of the war with Ukraine.\n\nBut it was only in recent days that intelligence officials got the initial warnings that Mr. Prigozhin might take action.\n\nOfficials said that intelligence agencies did not know what the results of Mr. Prigozhin taking military action would be, but they were immediately worried about how it might affect the control of Russia\u2019s arsenal of nuclear weapons. President Biden, speaking last October, talked of the dangers that Mr. Putin would pose if he felt cornered and said the U.S. was looking for \u201coff ramps\u201d for Mr. Putin.\n\nCNN earlier reported that the U.S. briefed congressional leaders about their concerns that Mr. Prigozhin was preparing to challenge Russia\u2019s military leadership.\n\nSince Mr. Prigozhin took action on Friday, American officials have been locked down, saying little publicly about his intentions or what they knew about events on the ground. Officials have been wary, both because events were moving fast and because they did not want to give Mr. Putin any excuse to blame the west for Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s actions. But several officials said they fully expected that Mr. Putin would eventually say the uprising was the result of a foreign plot.",

There wasn&#39;t time for a political maneuvers. </p>\n\n<p>I know everyone is currently saying &quot; there&#39;s no way he can rule&quot; and &quot; he doesn&#39;t have a regional power base.&quot; I&#39;m not sure either of these are true. First of all, we do not know what type of allies he currently has. We also don&#39;t know the extent of his public support. Social media skills may represent more than we are giving it credit for. We also don&#39;t know if he has the loyalty of any of the regional factions. </p>\n\n<p>I just don&#39;t think we know enough except for to say that we&#39;re seeing a very cesarean maneuver by a popular military commander taking his battle hardened troops on a thunder run to the capital. Anything can happen. I think the Russians are going to be pragmatic. I think that the vast majority of even the armed forces are going to hang back and see what happens.</p>\n</div>",

Let's examine one by one how the situation in Russia is different. \n\nFirst, the media. Individuals may trust state media, but as a whole society does not. Remember the old adage they're lying to us, we know they're lying to us, and they know we know they're lying to us? Shaping the information space doesn't necessarily mean capturing some state news outlet and getting your message out. Right now the information space is largely being shaped on social media. You don't need to capture state media if you can have videos of you succeeding. He's going to have days and days of videos of him succeeding. \n\nNext, I don't think that we have to look for the physical capture of state institutions. Those state institutions can be captured as soon as it looks like the tide is turning. In a conflict of elites, the people who control those institutions are going to go with whoever is going to come out on top. \n\nI don't think that the best analogy here is really a coup. I think the best analogy is Caesar's run on Rome. The surprise and the shock was all associated with a supposedly loyal military unit turning on the government and marching against all taboos on the capital. There's a lot of parallels right now to Caesar or Sulla. \n\nIn my mind, the real question here is, are we in a 1918 situation or a 1991 situation? Does Wagner have an expression of widespread discontent like the Soviets did in the Zarist  Navy or is it a doomed gesture like the August coupe was?",

At that point, you either convene every member of the legislature (even if all thats left are two radicals and a duck) and dissolve it, or have them give you supreme executive authority, or continue to operate as normal but acknowledge your 'special situation.' Then you band the old guy and his followers as traitors and order the Army to hound them down. The push then becomes, how many people are loyal to the throne itself (to the state, whoever controls it) and how many a loyal to the men? How many people decide once you have a clear success that the wind has changed sides? \n\nA good example that people are bringing up is 1917. There the Duma continued to meet and reformed itself as the Provisional Assembly, that is the first step in creating a democratic constitution. The put one guy in charge (Kerensky) and he drafted ministers, and then the government went right on humming along. Despite the fact that the Tsar still controlled most of the countryside. The Provisional Government was aided at least by the Tsar's early abdication, had he clung to power things would have gotten awkward, but even after the abdication a number of Tsarists refused to back the PG so its control was far from absolute. Making matters even more awkward was the formation of the Soviets which were a powerful sort of oppositional government. The PG, to their supreme error, tried to make nice with the Soviets and especially the St. Petersburg Workers and Soldier's soviet. This would end up coming back to bite them in the failed July coups and the more successful October revolution. \n\nAs for paper pushers, then as today the modern state relies too much on specialists to function without them. Moscow's toilets still need to flush, the roads still need fixing, the ambulances have to arrive as quickly as they did before. Its almost impossible to just purge these people overnight and then resume city services Monday morning. Whether your toilet flushes or backs up is also probably more important to most Muscovites than whose in the Kremlin. So its better to just let the administrators administrate until the crisis is over and you can weed them out longer term. Thankfully for the coups plotters many people tend to let inertia carry them along. And there are, of course, more draconian measures one can take to enforce compliance. A few firing squads here and there send a strong message about political affiliations, and the Commissariate was designed to solve this exact problem within military units (old Tsarist officers, the spets, who needed to be kept in line by the Bolshevik government).",

And it's hard to see how continuing to fight or even expanding the effort in Ukraine would help him with that. \n\nEven if he is a much better military mind than the people who've been running the invasion for Russia so far, he'd still have to grapple with a lot of the same systemic problems that have plagued Russia so far. Their military is just plain bad. Their doctrines suck, their training sucks, their equipment sucks, their logistics suck. And Russia's economy has a ton of deep rooted problems, and for the most part seems to be at least a couple decades behind the west in terms of technology, capacity, etc. \n\nEven if he had a good plan to fix all of those things, we're talking about a generational type project to really get Russia turned around. The Ukrainians got serious about reforming their military after Russia seized Crimea back in 2014, and then spent almost 8 years working on modernizing with a lot of help and training from NATO and western militaries. Some various western military leaders who helped with that transition have talked about it and said while the Ukrainians worked hard at it and made a lot of progress, they still had a ways to go to get up to NATO standards at the time that the big invasion started. \n\nSo the Ukrainians spent 8 years on this military transformation with lots of western help and they still weren't finished. Even if Russia got serious about it tomorrow and everyone there bought into it, it'd be an even bigger project than Ukraine's military was, they'd be doing it without all of that western assistance, and they'd be doing it with an economy that's not really anywhere near up to the task, especially since over the past 18 months a ton of their skilled workers fled the country and a lot of their regular labor force has died in Ukraine. \n\nThen on top of that try to imagine them making that transition while also continuing to fight a high intensity war in Ukraine, and that just makes the whole process even less efficient and more costly. \n\nAt this point the Russian military is so exhausted in so many ways, I think you could brainwash the best and brightest military minds from NATO and put them in charge of the invasion in Ukraine, and even they couldn't meaningfully turn the tide. You just can't turn around the capabilities of a large military overnight, it takes a lot of time and a lot of resources. \n\nEven if Prigozhin takes power this weekend and dedicates himself to turning Russia into a true military powerhouse, it'd likely be decades before he could realistically rebuild them to something in the same ballpark as what Russia had at the beginning of 2022. And the whole time Europe would likely be watching and cautiously increasing its defensive capabilities. \n\nObviously when you're talking about extreme assholes with huge egos like Putin and Prigozhin, it's hard to predict their mindset, but I find it really hard to see a scenario where he comes to power and it's wise or even particularly feasible for him to double down on the Ukraine invasion in any sort of way that meaningfully changes the strategic situation there. It would make way way way more sense for him to just blame Putin for screwing it all up, having the Russian military leave Ukraine, and focus on consolidating his power instead of throwing away more resources on a war that they're doing pretty badly in.",

That turned out to be completely accurate. It's remarkable how *little* support Prigozhin received.  No politicians, no securocrats, no oligarchs, no generals came out to support him.  Not even Kadyrov.  Zero support from outside Wagner.\n\n2.  Putin has always wanted the option to scapegoat Shoigu and Gerasamov and the ability to play that card at the opportune moment.  That explains why he's let Prigozhin's feud with them go on so long and so publicly.  Shoigu and Gerasimov are old and were ready to retire before invasion of Ukraine, so I don't think dumping them hurts Putin too much with loyal supporters.  If they go as reported, then expect them to land very softly.  Them going is not bad for Putin; Putin looking weak by being forced to dismiss them is bad for Putin.\n\n3.  Putin appeared to be ready to chop legs out from Prigozhin by requiring mercs to sign on with MOD.  Credit to Prigozhin as he seems to have seen it coming and has probably been preparing for this for weeks.\n\n4.  I'm not sure the march on Moscow was the biggest threat to Putin.  There a lot more military and security forces in that area than Rostov.  I would presume more loyal and willing to fight as well.  \n\n5.  I think the biggest pressure point might have been Prigozhin threatening to bunker down in Rostov and shut off supplies to Russian army through Rostov.  The mutiny was intentionally timed for Ukrainian offensive where it could cause maximum disruption to Russian military in Zaporizhia.  While Prigozhin may not have been able to unseat Putin in Moscow, he may have been able to cause the total collapse of the Russian military in Ukraine, and I would not put it past him to both threaten it and carry out his threat unless his demands were met.\n\n6.  This is a big win for Prigozhin (unless see next point).  It looks like he'll get a victory over his hated Shoigu.  More importantly, he can keep his power base of Wagner mercenaries.  When the day comes that Putin is no longer in power, he'll be a powerful ally for whoever tries to succeed Putin.\n\n7.  Putin will never forgive or forget.  Putin hates traitors and think they must be destroyed.  Undoubtedly, Prigozhin will be on top of Putin's to do list when the right time and opportunity arises.  Prigozhin must be planning on outliving Putin and being useful to his successor because as long as Putin is in power, he will be thinking about how and when to kill him.",

Maybe someone else has time for digging. Any new info on how Ukraines [order of 100 pzh2000?](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-approves-sale-100-howitzers-ukraine-spiegel-2022-07-27/) Or the [50 Krabs?](https://mezha.media/en/2022/06/08/poland-sells-to-ukraine-more-than-50-new-155-mm-ahs-krab/)\n\nGepard is not produced for years already, sadly.\n\nMBTs: Good question TBH. Has there been any public news about Leo 2 production speed? US still appears reluctant donating Abrahams, and theoretically those could come from stuck anyway (yes yes DU armour..)\n\nIFVs: Poland is bound to be ramping up its IFV production. Rheinmetal is supplying Marders as far as they can. For modern IFVs, its a good question (only CV90 and Bradley).\n\nDrones: Clearly scaling up based on various reports (including, but not limited to, domestic production in Ukraine). \n\nMore info about tanks and IFVs would be great. Seems to be a lot of need and rather lacking answers so far, unless the US is willing to commit Bradley/Abrahams en masse.\n\nGerman Puma is needed for German army, Marder isn't produced anymore AFAIK, Ukraine will get 100-200+ from stocks / decomission over time. France and England also don't seem to be supplying any IFVs, tanks kinda same (thanks for the 10 Challies but that's going to be it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, it's clear things are not moving as fast as we'd like, and some companies seem more proactive than others, but it's also undeniable that there is a ramping up of activity.

Maybe someone else has time for digging. Any new info on how Ukraines <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-approves-sale-100-howitzers-ukraine-spiegel-2022-07-27/\">order of 100 pzh2000?</a> Or the <a href=\"https://mezha.media/en/2022/06/08/poland-sells-to-ukraine-more-than-50-new-155-mm-ahs-krab/\">50 Krabs?</a></p>\n\n<p>Gepard is not produced for years already, sadly.</p>\n\n<p>MBTs: Good question TBH. Has there been any public news about Leo 2 production speed? US still appears reluctant donating Abrahams, and theoretically those could come from stuck anyway (yes yes DU armour..)</p>\n\n<p>IFVs: Poland is bound to be ramping up its IFV production. Rheinmetal is supplying Marders as far as they can. For modern IFVs, its a good question (only CV90 and Bradley).</p>\n\n<p>Drones: Clearly scaling up based on various reports (including, but not limited to, domestic production in Ukraine). </p>\n\n<p>More info about tanks and IFVs would be great. Seems to be a lot of need and rather lacking answers so far, unless the US is willing to commit Bradley/Abrahams en masse.</p>\n\n<p>German Puma is needed for German army, Marder isn&#39;t produced anymore AFAIK, Ukraine will get 100-200+ from stocks / decomission over time. France and England also don&#39;t seem to be supplying any IFVs, tanks kinda same (thanks for the 10 Challies but that&#39;s going to be it).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it&#39;s clear things are not moving as fast as we&#39;d like, and some companies seem more proactive than others, but it&#39;s also undeniable that there is a ramping up of activity.

How was Russia unprepared for this, but US intelligence services knew 2 weeks in advance that something is cooking?

Only issue is this was highly risky and also damaged MoD and Putin popularity - not sure by how much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Prigozhin is a man of the system, friends with other Siloviki, and he was not alone in this coup.

If this indeed is true to some extent, how would Putin react to being kept in the dark about the development of a coup, and what made others back down. Imo, this argument is flowed because I can't think of a rational decision where Silovikis together decided to keep Putin in the dark, to then side with him. Only if not all Silovikis where indeed taking part from the beginning, making this not only Wagner vs MoD, but a group of Siloviks vs another group of silovikis. If this is true, then further reverberations and infighting between elite will continue.\n\nOne important thing to not forget or take lightly in here is the fact that the coup stopped before a full fledged confrontation started. Did Prigozhin, after sending Wagner to a 8month meatgrinder in Bahkmut, all of the sudden decided that he respects human life and will not risk the lifes of his soldiers to fullfill his objectives? Or maybe after visiting the Bakmut frontline for several time, while being surrounded by sadist and criminals from Wagner who could put a bullet in his head at any time, now decided that he is afraid for his life? I very much doubt that Prigozhin is a coward, or that he cares about human life in general.\n\nImo, the situation is far more complex than Prigozhin Vs MoD, and the reasons for his confidence in starting this coup and than stopping it in just a few hours later, leaving perplex even some Wagner propaganda channels, was more of a proxy battle between a group of Siloviki Putin challengers vs a group of loyalists and Putin himself. First battle was won by Putin, but the damage was done. Round two when?",
