Or using actual &quot;elite&quot; units like VDV, MPS, or Spetsnaz.</p>\n\n<p>But on the defensive, Ivan Mobik or Evgeny Contraknik manning the zero line are likely not too motivated to go toe to toe with UAF assault troops. Not unusual, retreats or surrenders typically happen at that range by defenders. </p>\n\n<p>Just to emphasize though, being better at it doesn&#39;t necessarily equate to tactical or operational success. But it&#39;s still something to be proud about.</p>\n</div>",

At Soledar they were not prepared for fall back, that's why they fought so hard to keep them, and why everything went to shit afterwards.\n\nThey definitely weren't prepared to fall back slowly near Kremmina, if they fall back it's because there was no alternative. \n\nWhen the Russians launched a minor attack near Svatove over the summer the Ukrainians didn't slowly pull back, they retreated when the defenders routed, rushed more units to hold, then counterattacked to move back to the start line, because they weren't allowed to lose ground. To do that they used units meant for the counteroffensive, so when you wonder why Tokmat wasn't reached, there is your answer. \n\nThey've not developed a defense in depth because they're not allowed to retreat. We're hearing now that despite Avdiivka being partially encircled for a year they didn't even develop fall back lines. Why would they? They're not allowed to retreat and they don't plan to do it. Not slowly, not at all. \n\nHold. At. All. Costs. \n\n>But there's no point falling back too easily, the Russians aren't going to stop taking territory if you make it easy for them, and everything you lose makes it that much harder to take everything back.\n\nIt's this mindset that is causing this entire recruitment crisis, the Ukrainians are suffering unsustainable casualties that are caused by policies like when largely useless terrain is valued more than force preservation.\n\nMade worse when tied to poor kill ratio math especially when people don't know that retreat doesn't mean giving up without a fight. \n\nGo read up on [maneuver defense[](https://www.moore.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2021/Spring/2Grau_Bartles21.pdf). It's a Soviet era tactic that is basically a series of ambushes and counterattacks to hurt the enemy to the maximum degree while trying to buy time and preserve the force. \n\nDespite wanting to since Donbas last year. the Ukrainians aren't allowed to retreat without permission from Kyiv so they can't do it. Instead they are forced to hold positions, especially long after they become untenable, where the defenders suffer horrible casualties but are still forced to remain in place because, as exactly what you describe, it's poor optics to retreat. \n\nFor that matter the Russians can't use maneuver defense either for the exact same reason as the Ukrainians, their strategic leadership forbids retreat unless there is no alternative. \n\nBut Russia can replace its losses, Ukraine can't. I've been saying this since the summer of 2022, the Ukrainians need to preserve their force.

It\u2019s the Philippines\u2019 sole outpost in the shoal designed to establish its sovereignty in the fishing-rich waters.\n\n\n>The successful Nov. 10 mission was a display of the trilateral partnership between the Philippines, the US and Japan that is challenging Beijing\u2019s efforts to control the disputed area. With Washington renewing its security guarantees for Manila, this remote reef has become a key flashpoint for US-China competition in the region, potentially rivaling the long-running friction over Taiwan.\n\n>The Philippine convoy last week hosted reporters from local and international media, including Bloomberg News, as part of Manila\u2019s efforts to publicize China\u2019s tactics. The mission came just days before US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in San Francisco in an effort to mend ties. Earlier this month, the US and China held their first talks focused solely on maritime issues since September 2019.\n\n>Over the years, Philippine officials have become increasingly worried about the degradation of the Sierra Madre. Rust and the elements have left gaping holes in the hull and could render the vessel uninhabitable if left unattended. China has steadfastly opposed the Philippines\u2019 efforts to repair the Sierra Madre and has repeatedly urged Manila to tow it away.\n\n>\u201cThe deterioration is faster than the supply that we do,\u201d Philippine Defense Senior Undersecretary Ireneo Espino said in September.\n\n\n>In the latest operation, the Philippines said it detected a total of 38 Chinese ships during the voyage, including fishing trawlers and a hospital vessel. Manila had five \u2014 the three coast guard ships built by Japan and two supply boats chartered by the military.\n\n>The mission began at around 9 a.m. on Thursday as two Philippine coast guard ships, with journalists on board, began escorting the supply boats on the day-long voyage to Second Thomas Shoal.\n\n\n\n>As one of the coast guard vessels, the BRP Sindangan, moved closer to the shoal, a speeding ship from China\u2019s coast guard sailed in close proximity and abruptly cut across its path. Minutes later, the Sindangan was blocked when it was corralled by four Chinese vessels \u2014 two from the coast guard and two fishing trawlers.\n\n>\u201cEven if they triple the number of Chinese vessels that they are going to deploy, the Philippine coast guard will not be deterred in carrying out the resupply operation,\u201d coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela told reporters on Saturday in Manila. \u201cWe are still going to carry out this dangerous mission despite our limited number of vessels.\u201d\n\n\n>On a previous resupply mission on Oct. 22, Chinese and Philippine vessels collided on two separate occasions.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-12/inside-the-philippines-dangerous-mission-in-the-south-china-sea\">Inside the Philippines\u2019 Dangerous Mission in the South China Sea</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bloomberg News joins resupply operation to military outpost</li>\n<li>Manila, backed by US and Japan, defies China in disputed sea</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As sailors scrambled to unload provisions from two small boats for troops on a grounded ship in the South China Sea, a US Navy aircraft flew overhead while three Japanese-built Philippine coast guard vessels kept watch.</p>\n\n<p>They in turn were monitored by a flotilla of Chinese coast guard ships and other vessels that had spent the past few hours trying to obstruct the Philippine vessels from reaching their destination, including firing a water cannon.</p>\n\n<p>The scene was the climax of the latest mission to resupply the BRP Sierra Madre, a decaying World War II-era vessel that Manila intentionally grounded on Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 in response to China\u2019s occupation of Mischief Reef four years earlier. It\u2019s the Philippines\u2019 sole outpost in the shoal designed to establish its sovereignty in the fishing-rich waters.</p>\n\n<p>The successful Nov. 10 mission was a display of the trilateral partnership between the Philippines, the US and Japan that is challenging Beijing\u2019s efforts to control the disputed area. With Washington renewing its security guarantees for Manila, this remote reef has become a key flashpoint for US-China competition in the region, potentially rivaling the long-running friction over Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>The Philippine convoy last week hosted reporters from local and international media, including Bloomberg News, as part of Manila\u2019s efforts to publicize China\u2019s tactics. The mission came just days before US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in San Francisco in an effort to mend ties. Earlier this month, the US and China held their first talks focused solely on maritime issues since September 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, Philippine officials have become increasingly worried about the degradation of the Sierra Madre. Rust and the elements have left gaping holes in the hull and could render the vessel uninhabitable if left unattended. China has steadfastly opposed the Philippines\u2019 efforts to repair the Sierra Madre and has repeatedly urged Manila to tow it away.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe deterioration is faster than the supply that we do,\u201d Philippine Defense Senior Undersecretary Ireneo Espino said in September.</p>\n\n<p>In the latest operation, the Philippines said it detected a total of 38 Chinese ships during the voyage, including fishing trawlers and a hospital vessel. Manila had five \u2014 the three coast guard ships built by Japan and two supply boats chartered by the military.</p>\n\n<p>The mission began at around 9 a.m. on Thursday as two Philippine coast guard ships, with journalists on board, began escorting the supply boats on the day-long voyage to Second Thomas Shoal.</p>\n\n<p>As one of the coast guard vessels, the BRP Sindangan, moved closer to the shoal, a speeding ship from China\u2019s coast guard sailed in close proximity and abruptly cut across its path. Minutes later, the Sindangan was blocked when it was corralled by four Chinese vessels \u2014 two from the coast guard and two fishing trawlers.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEven if they triple the number of Chinese vessels that they are going to deploy, the Philippine coast guard will not be deterred in carrying out the resupply operation,\u201d coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela told reporters on Saturday in Manila. \u201cWe are still going to carry out this dangerous mission despite our limited number of vessels.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On a previous resupply mission on Oct. 22, Chinese and Philippine vessels collided on two separate occasions. The damage to the Philippine supply boat was so bad that a replacement was used in Friday\u2019s operation, the government said.</p>\n\n<p>This time, the Philippine coast guard added a larger patrol vessel to the group, the Japan-built BRP Melchora Aquino \u2014 named after a Filipina hero known as the mother of the Philippine revolution. As the Melchora Aquino sailed toward Second Thomas Shoal, a China coast guard ship blasted a furious message to it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou must stop your illegal operation immediately. If you continue to disregard our warning, we will take necessary measures and you will take full responsibility for the consequences resulting therein.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the journey, the Sindangan radioed to the Chinese vessels: \u201cThis is Philippine Coast Guard vessel BRP Sindangan conducting a routine maritime patrol within the Philippine exclusive economic zone.
