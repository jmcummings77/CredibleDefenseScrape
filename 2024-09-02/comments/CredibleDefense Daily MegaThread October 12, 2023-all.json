      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

DeepStateMap and several other OSINTers place many DNR units around the Avdiivka salient. DSM lists the Somalia Battalion, Piatnashka Battalion, 277th Rifle Battalion, 109th Rifle Regiment, Sloviansk Brigade, and 117th Rifle Regiment (all DNR units) as composing almost the entire FLOT around Avdiivka, with the 144th GMRD ([which was almost entirely destroyed fighting for Bakhmut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/144th_Guards_Motor_Rifle_Division#2022_invasion_of_Ukraine)) and a Storm-Z unit as the only Russian units listed specifically on the front lines around the salient.\n\nI doubt that the Russians used the units that are holding the line there for their offensive, though, because that would compromise their defense and because the number of vehicles committed seems to far exceed the amount required to hold what is generally speaking a relatively quiet sector of the front, at least from the Ukrainian side. They've also generally formed assault units ad hoc from more elite units, separately from the FLOT defensive units in trenches. Correspondingly, they've allocated lower quality troops with poorer equipment to holding the first line of defense, while retaining those more elite, assault-capable units as reserves for active defense or for offensive actions.

                                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Although I don&#39;t disagree with your assessment of the level of attrition experienced by DNR units overall, <a href=\"/u/smashedbyagolem\">/u/smashedbyagolem</a>&#39;s point is not without some support. DeepStateMap and several other OSINTers place many DNR units around the Avdiivka salient. DSM lists the Somalia Battalion, Piatnashka Battalion, 277th Rifle Battalion, 109th Rifle Regiment, Sloviansk Brigade, and 117th Rifle Regiment (all DNR units) as composing almost the entire FLOT around Avdiivka, with the 144th GMRD (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/144th_Guards_Motor_Rifle_Division#2022_invasion_of_Ukraine\">which was almost entirely destroyed fighting for Bakhmut</a>) and a Storm-Z unit as the only Russian units listed specifically on the front lines around the salient.</p>\n\n<p>I doubt that the Russians used the units that are holding the line there for their offensive, though, because that would compromise their defense and because the number of vehicles committed seems to far exceed the amount required to hold what is generally speaking a relatively quiet sector of the front, at least from the Ukrainian side. They&#39;ve also generally formed assault units ad hoc from more elite units, separately from the FLOT defensive units in trenches. Correspondingly, they&#39;ve allocated lower quality troops with poorer equipment to holding the first line of defense, while retaining those more elite, assault-capable units as reserves for active defense or for offensive actions.

Talks concluded with the decision not to raise the alert level\n\n> The night before Hamas' assault, an accumulation of signs or fragments of information aroused certain concern. Two telephone consultations were held during the night among the southern region of the Shin Bet security service, the IDF\u2019s Intelligence Corps, the operations division and Southern Command with the knowledge of IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi. A separate consultation was held at the Shin Bet with the head of the agency, Ronen Bar.\n\n> There was significant nervousness at the command. At the Shin Bet, it was claimed that the information involved an exercise. The Intelligence Corps shared this assessment and didn\u2019t recommend any increased state of alert. That was the case with both of the consultations in the space of a few hours. On the Shin Bet\u2019s recommendation and with military approval at the highest level, no steps were taken.\n\n> At the Shin Bet, the signs were deemed \u201cweak signals\u201d from which it wasn\u2019t possible to derive sufficient insight on activity in the near future. Nevertheless, there was concern about an isolated abduction attack at the Shin Bet, and it dispatched a small operational squad to the south. No other steps were taken, and it was decided to wait until morning. By then it was too late. The Shin Bet squad that did go south was involved in combat at a kibbutz near the Gaza border later in the day on Saturday, where one of its members was wounded.\n\n> Israel's security establishment was surprised by what seemed like a coordinated leak by a political source to political reporters regarding the intelligence failure that preceded the terror attack. Security sources told Haaretz that it is no coincidence that shortly after the chief of staff's statement to the public taking responsibility for the horrible failure someone was already busy briefing in detail regarding the failures of the IDF and the Shin Bet.\n\n> The security establishment reminds that in the months preceding the war, all the heads of the security establishment warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the possibility of disaster in light of the internal crisis surrounding Netanyahu's insistence to pass the regime coup legislation. The prime minister, the sources reminded, ignored all appeals, including a direct warning by the chief of staff regarding the expecting harm to the fitness of all military units, and the Air Force in particular, due to the coup steps.\n\n> The Prime Minister's Office said on Thursday that \"Netanyahu was updated only at 6:29 A.M. as fighting broke out, and not before.

Good luck tracking what's in use, where, when, and on what frequency while not hurting yourself even more in the process.\n\nGenerally their strategy is to conduct broadband jamming across the entire frequency range that they expect the Ukrainians to be using, while selectively not jamming the frequencies they know their own drones use. Basically they block the entire radio spectrum by default except the limited ranges that their Orlans are using. I believe that they are actually able to coordinate the specific frequencies and maybe even frequency hop in sync with their mil drones like the Orlans, but like Ukraine their commercial drones probably lack the capability to integrate with their EW systems. Also worth noting that some Russian EW systems are able to detect what frequencies are being used in an area before jamming or attempting to hijack the signal.\n\nBut I don't think that's why they are absent from this offensive. The Russians have figured out how to make good use of their EW on the defensive, with early reports about the counteroffensive back in June indicating that it was a major factor in disrupting Ukrainian coordination during some or all of their initial, failed combined arms breaching assaults. But that's when the Ukrainians are moving *into* the EW coverage zone. Whereas during an offensive as the Russian forces push forward into Ukrainian territory, they are moving *away from* their EW coverage. The Russians have been working hard to disguise the various components of their EW systems to protect them against Ukrainian FPV drone strikes and other long range fires, which is an advantage they lose as soon as they pack the system up into its mobile platform, typically a modified BAZ truck or sometimes a trailer, depending on the exact EW system in question. Given the relatively small numbers of EW systems available and their evidently high value to the Russian defense, my first guess would be that they are unwilling to risk them by moving them forward to push their EW coverage out over no man's land and into Ukrainian occupied territory. I believe the broadband jamming range for the Krasukha-4 is around 10km, so once pushed forward enough to cover an offensive they would be well within even mortar range of Ukrainian positions, in an area where the Ukrainians will be conducting extensive reconnaissance, while also giving up whatever protection a camouflaged position in the rear had permitted them. All of which is a recipe for destroyed, irreplaceable assets that are otherwise proving critical for disrupting the ongoing Ukrainian offensives.",

I think my personal reaction to someone who&#39;s had their head cut off and someone who has had their head shot a few times would be about the same, but what you&#39;re saying makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>This comment chain is getting wildly off topic though.

The wide net for ideology that /u/app_priori described in his reply (even including several beyond those listed like Christian evangelicals).\n2. The massive Jewish/Arab diaspora throughout the west and their relationship to institutions like politics and traditional media.\n3. The context of the holocaust which massively galvanises people and causes arguments about how much leniency/what unique circumstances that affords (particularly in western nations).\n4. The well documented atrocities that both have committed.\n5. The length of the conflict.\n6. The history and context of the conflict which spans literally thousands of years.\n7. It's right on the border between \"_too far enough away to care about_\" and \"_too close to avoid picking a side_\". Two people can have totally different opinions on the conflict because of this and never realise whereas for a lot of other conflicts you can see the \"_side_\" that someone will support on their skin or hear it in the way that they talk before they've said a word about their stance.\n8. There are no plausible, viable solutions to the conflict in the long term which don't involve ethnic cleansing.\n\nTalking about it is like trying to fight a bog and once someone is emotionally invested into one side or the other it's so easy to find valid reasons to affirm your own position and dehumanise the other.",

Purpose built DEW weapons, of which there are very few, generally use highly directional parabolic dishes rather than phased arrays, and different signal generation means like klystron tubes operating at mmw frequencies (30 to 300 ghz).</p>\n\n<p>In this particular case the ship was probably worried about interference effects degrading other aircraft&#39;s radar view, as well as the benefit of keep any random low altitude traffic away from a Russian jet acting unpredictable.</p>\n</div>",

It will be ugly and they can never 100% get rid of an organization like Hamas, but it could become like ISIS -- a shadow of its former self that's mostly marginalized from the levers of power.\n2. While this is happening, Israel negotiates with the Arab countries it has relations with -- Jordan, Egypt, UAE, Bahrain, and maybe Morocco -- to form an *Arab-led* coalition to secure and develop Gaza as an independent city-state. Call it the \"Gaza Development Coalition\" or GDC for short. Other less-/non-hostile Arab states like Saudi and Oman could join as observers/consultants.\n3. The GDC is going to be messy no matter what, but the best outcome would be something like Jordan running the governance, UAE and Bahrain financing infrastructure development, and Egypt and Morocco collaborating on security (Egypt because it's directly interested in a secure Gaza, Morocco because it's removed enough to counterbalance Egypt getting *too* invested).\n4. The IDF has a phased withdrawal from Gaza, being replaced by GDC security forces. This is done gradually, city by city. The blockade is also gradually lifted by Israel green-lighting sea trade and foreign direct investment to Gaza by other countries on a case-by-case basis. The US, EU, India, China, and GDC countries should all be trusted enough by Israel to been green-lit early on, which should be enough potential trade to kickstart Gaza's economy.\n5. A new Gazan governance structure is built, possibly as a constitutional emirate along the lines of Jordan maybe? I don't think that single-minded focus on Western-style constitutional democracy is going to be productive here. The important thing is for Gazans to feel that their new city-state is legitimately Arab in culture and character. If we end up with a political system akin to \"Palestinian Singapore\" or \"Mediterranean Dubai\" then so be it.\n6. Over the course of a decade or so, GDC institutions are gradually replaced by Gazan institutions. Hopefully, enough trust will eventually be built to the point that Israel will send Gaza on its way with mutual recognition, if not necessarily friendship.\n\nOf course, this doesn't resolve anything about the West Bank. I suppose Israel withdrawing settlements from the West Bank as a show of good faith would help a process like this along. Far easier said than done, of course.",

Informal terminology is based on a number of different landmarks though, most typically mosques but also things like markets, so it's not very stable.\n\nMy best guess, based on the contents of the report (\"hub for the Hamas terrorist organization\", \"North of the Gaza strip\"), and on [this report](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/10/11/photos-rimal-neighbourhood-the-beating-heart-of-gaza-wiped-out) is that this is the NE part of Rimal, between al-Shati and Nazla. Some of it is more recently built, I think, so it wouldn't qualify as Rimal \"proper\". But it's pretty much a hunch.",

            "body": "I've really been wondering that as well. This is just such a massive break in how Hamas has operated in the last fifteen or so years. Its been made even more confusing in light of how inconsistent their fighters' behavior seemed to have been during the incursion. There are a number of interviews with Israeli civilians where they describe the Hamas fighters being basically descent, abiding by the rules of war and even fraternizing with the Israeli civilians, with CCTV capturing them getting the civilians to cover during firefights, the released prisoner saying she and her children were treated well. At the same time, there are other moments where the fighters seemed to unleashing just barbaric unrestrained violence on the civilian population, shooting indiscriminately, burning occupied homes, mutilating the corpses of Israeli soldiers, etc. \n\nTo me this says that the violence upon the civilian population was NOT ordered by the Hamas high command, but rather is the result of some other phenomena. That could simply be a breakdown of discipline, as extremely motivated but poorly trained paramilitaries crossed the border. Almost all of the fighters would have only encountered Israelis before in the form of fighter jets bombing Gaza or the snipers taking shots over the border fence, effectively two things they could do nothing to retaliate against. We've seen before that when an armed group is unable to retaliate against an armed opponent incurring losses on them they sometimes take their frustration and impotence out on the civilian population.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve really been wondering that as well. This is just such a massive break in how Hamas has operated in the last fifteen or so years. Its been made even more confusing in light of how inconsistent their fighters&#39; behavior seemed to have been during the incursion. There are a number of interviews with Israeli civilians where they describe the Hamas fighters being basically descent, abiding by the rules of war and even fraternizing with the Israeli civilians, with CCTV capturing them getting the civilians to cover during firefights, the released prisoner saying she and her children were treated well. At the same time, there are other moments where the fighters seemed to unleashing just barbaric unrestrained violence on the civilian population, shooting indiscriminately, burning occupied homes, mutilating the corpses of Israeli soldiers, etc. </p>\n\n<p>To me this says that the violence upon the civilian population was NOT ordered by the Hamas high command, but rather is the result of some other phenomena. That could simply be a breakdown of discipline, as extremely motivated but poorly trained paramilitaries crossed the border. Almost all of the fighters would have only encountered Israelis before in the form of fighter jets bombing Gaza or the snipers taking shots over the border fence, effectively two things they could do nothing to retaliate against. We&#39;ve seen before that when an armed group is unable to retaliate against an armed opponent incurring losses on them they sometimes take their frustration and impotence out on the civilian population. It&#39;s what happened in Ukraine in 2022 when Russian soldiers committed the massacre at Bucha after being repeatedly struck by drones, or Vietnam in 1968 when American soldiers committed the My Lai massacre after being harassed by Viet Cong who escaped them at every turn. </p>\n\n<p>Still, it doesn&#39;t explain why some groups of Palestinian fighters committed atrocities and some didn&#39;t.

You have to ask if it is a traditional / Modernist organization.  Hamas is a modernist / reform Islam organization.  This is important because it determines the structure of the organization.\n\nHamas runs everything through the Shura Council, one sees that in many Muslim Brotherhood-type organizations.  Another is the secrecy. I see that in Indonesia with a Muslim Brotherhood political party (PKS). Their council meetings are closed.\n\nThere is a social welfare wing, and this is how many militant organizations start off, and this is how Hamas started off. Then as they grow they develop a paramilitary wing. As they grow bigger they have their own educational institutions, charities for X, women's branches, and orphanages. It is a whole ecosystem.\n\nThe paramilitary can vary greatly with the organization. Hamas's military wing Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades operates on a cell structure, meaning one cell might not know what the other cell is doing. This could be a reason why there is a different type of behavior.   To get selected to the  Din al-Qassam Brigades usually has to go through Hamas social organizations - schools, orphanages etc\n\nThere are different types of groups in the Gaza Strip. And individuals might splinter and form more radical groups. Israel can take down Hamas, but individuals can easily form another organization. I have seen it happen many times in Indonesia.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the reason why it was so indiscriminate, even Muslims were killed, was because they were pressed for time. They knew the response time of the IDF. For example, in the terrorist attacks on the Taj Mahal Palace, the attackers went around asking people to recite the Shahada (the declaration of faith). If they didn't, they would kill them.  I read al-Shabaab used the same method in Kenya in 2013.\n\nOne also has to understand, that different militant organizations differ in their emphasis on Islam.  Al-Shabaab takes Islam more seriously than Hamas which is a nationalist cum Islamist organization.  I remember hearing a story of a Christian Indonesian fisherman along with other Muslim colleagues by a Filipino Muslim group Abu-Sayyaf. The group assumed everyone was Muslim, since Indonesian = Muslim, even though 1/6 are non-Muslim, along the Filipino-Indonesian border its more like 30% Christian vs 70% Muslim. The other Indonesians told him, just follow us, and they started to teach him the prayers, etc.  After a couple of months, they released the crew.",

The Israeli Government has set out its reasons for doing so, emphasizing that it is not only not a proscribed weapon under international law but that it was deployed with a high degree of success. It has explained that it used white phosphorous in two forms. One was as exploding munitions used as mortar shells by ground and naval forces. It says that in this form it was deployed only in unpopulated areas for marking and signalling purposes, and not in an anti-personnel capacity. It claims that, as a result of international concerns, it decided to stop using these munitions on 7 January 2009, although this was not required by international law. It also acknowledges the use of smoke projectiles containing felt wedges dipped in white phosphorous.*\n\n**Another quote from a doctor active at the time in a hospital.**\n\n*The doctor commented that, before the military operations, the hospital was not familiar with white phosphorous burns. Staff became concerned when patients who had been sent home after treatment of apparently minor burns would come back in the following days with more serious wounds. They found that when they removed the bandages that had been applied to a wound that still contained fragments of white phosphorous, smoke would come from the wound, even hours after the injury. White phosphorous continues to burn as long as it is in contact with oxygen.*\n\n**Then last point on white phosphorus use in 2009.**\n\n*While accepting that white phosphorous is not at this stage proscribed under international law, the Mission considers that the repeated misuse of the substance by the Israeli armed forces during this operation calls into question the wisdom of allowing its continued use without some further degree of control. The Mission understands the need to use obscurants and illuminants for various reasons during military operations and especially in screening troops from observation or enemy fire. There are, however, other screening and illuminating means which are free from the toxicities, volatilities and hazards that are inherent in the chemical white phosphorous. The use of white phosphorous in any from in and around areas dedicated to the health and safety of civilians has been shown to carry very substantial risks. The Mission therefore believes that serious consideration should be given to banning the use of white phosphorous as an obscurant.*\n\nSource: [https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf](https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf)\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is the leading United Nations entity in the field of human rights, with a unique mandate to promote and protect all human rights for all people.",

You don&#39;t have to take my word for it, he&#39;s quite explicit about this in a segment of the excellent documentary interview <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU1bzm-BW0o\">Fog of War</a> . </p>\n\n<p><strong>I strongly recommend anyone interested in the topics discussed here to watch this. It&#39;s an incredibly frank interview with someone that was at the center of cold war decision making.</strong></p>\n\n<p>War is politics by other means, not an abstract game of absolute obliteration. Proportionality is very much a criteria humans will use to judge your actions.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise I generally agree with your comment.</p>\n</div>",

Because the social norms behind violence have meaningfully changed.</p>\n\n<p>Reading a historical event in a textbook, and seeing one beamed in live 4K video with surround sound in real time to the world, are fundamentally different experiences. I am completely aware that bad things have happened historically, but those were historical events and not ongoing lifelong video feed where you can see visible facial expressions.</p>\n\n<p>It is incredibly easy to dehumanize historical actors. That&#39;s much harder to do when you can look up the people shooting on Facebook.</p>\n</div>",

Israel also employed white phosphorous against Gaza extensively in 2009, granted in a marking/signaling role. </p>\n\n<p>The defense here as well will be that WP munitions are being deployed not in an incendiary role, but in a signaling and marking role. This is probably true, but WP munitions are nonetheless extremely dangerous when employed in <em>any</em> role in populated areas. </p>\n\n<p>Contrary to what you&#39;ll hear on twitter, WP munitions are not strictly &quot;illegal&quot; or &quot;banned,&quot; but none the less, Israel should not be doing this.</p>\n</div>",
