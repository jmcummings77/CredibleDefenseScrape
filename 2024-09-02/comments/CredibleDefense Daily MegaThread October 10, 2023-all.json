        "body": "Quantification of the Russian grouping deployed in Ukraine by Ukrainian military intelligence (the estimates were released by the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets this morning, I added the estimates from the same source from 1 and 6 months ago for a comparison): \n\n\nTime period | Personnel | MBTs | AFVs | Artillery guns \u2265 100mm | MLRS\n:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:\nLate April 2023 | 396'000 | 1'764 | 4'289  |  2'994 | 870\nEarly September 2023 | 420'000 | 2'260 | 5'260 | 3'050 | 920\nEarly October 2023 | 429'000 | 2'347 | 5'653 | 3'186 | 974\n\n\nThis grouping is divided among 58 separate brigades (of all types - motorized, artillery, anti-aircraft missile etc.), 133 regiments (again: motorized, tank, territorial, VDV, etc.), 106 separate battalions and 46 detachments (BARS, Akhmat, Storm Z). The numbers exclude Rosgvardia's elements in the rear and Russian Army's forces deployed in the oblasts within the federal territory along the Russian-Ukrainian border (largely conscripts from the military service afaik), but include Army's elements deployed in Crimea.\n\nDespite the very considerable attrition Russia is experiencing, the trend seems to be towards growth in both men and gear (and at least compared to 6 months ago, the same is true for Ukraine, which in the meantime brought the vast majority of the new brigades to the front). \n\nThe growth over 6 months ago is probably due to the return to the front of the Western and Central Military Districts' formations that were reorganizing in Belarus until early spring and the attachment of new units (additional battalions, volunteer detachments, Storm Z units, reinforcements in general) to the Southern and Eastern MDs' formations. The growth over the last month is probably due to the deployment to the front of elements of the newly formed 18th and 25th Armies. \n\nDespite widespread belief (and certainly the losses incurred), both the Russian and Ukrainian Armies have likely never been as large as they've been in the last period, since the beginning of the war. This is actually pretty normal in wars of attrition (I recommend taking a look at the Iranian and especially Iraqi Army's numbers at the beginning, during and at the end of the long and costly war of the 1980s). Problems arise when one side cannot keep up with the military and military production growth of the opponent. This is not to say that the two armies aren't going to have problems in the future, nor does it tell us anything about the quality of new recruits or equipment. For example, Russian formations are being given an increasing number of BMP-1s, as well as T-80Bs, T-72Bs or T-62Ms, all of which are inferior to widespread models such as the T-72B3 or T-80BV - not to mention T-90M or T-80BVM, production of which continues, but there are still great doubts about the numbers Russia can churn out. There is also evidence that the Russians are having major problems with artillery barrels, having to remove barrels from a lot of pieces that are stored in reserve and questions arise about their shells production too. \n\nAnother question will be whether Russia can avoid a new major mobilization wave during the fall. At the moment Shoigu said he's satisfied with the numbers of new contract soldiers, which makes a new mobilization unnecessary in his opinion. In September Russian sources talk about 50k newly signed contracts - although the number should include the renewal of expired fixed-term contracts (that tend to last 6 months). To my knowledge mobilization today is very limited compared to the numbers from the last fall/winter and mainly concerns reserve officers, to replenish losses and in order to lead the new units being formed. Wages and bonuses for contract soldiers are being raised - it seems the standard now has become 200k rubles per month, 6/700k rubles as a one-off bonus upon signing the contract, and family support measures. These numbers could be enough for convincing a significant number of Russians to go to the front, nearly all of them from the poorer regions - not surprisingly, in the new units a very large number of soldiers reportedly come from North Caucasus, as well as from the Far East and poorer places in Siberia, the Urals and the Volga region.",

                "body": "At the moment the Ukrainian Army (too) is probably at (or, at worst, very near) its peak since the beginning of the war, in terms of both personnel and gear. This is not to say that in several brigades there aren't serious operational capability problems after having suffered heavy losses, particularly in those employed in the counteroffensive in the South. But it was the same, for example, in May 2022: one has to distinguish a brigade in poor condition from the structural difficulties in mobilizing new recruits.\n\nSpeaking of mobilization in general, there are relevant problems, although the issue is very sensitive and magnified by Russian propaganda. Ukraine no longer has the huge amount of volunteers who joined the armed forces in the first weeks of the war, and the mobilization process, which continues, also faces greater problems than in the past. I seem to recall that during the winter months, in conjunction with the formation of the new brigades, Ukraine was able to mobilize 30k men a month. Now it's very difficult to maintain that pace. Certainly the issue of \"diminishing marginal returns\" during a mobilization exists and is a real problem, which can be improved with better training compared to what we've seen so far. At the same time, I wouldn't be frightened off by certain articles and remember that the datas have to be compared to how realistic the expectations were - if a certain recruiting center recruited only a (rather small) % of what it wanted, it can be because either it actually recruited very little or because it had placed an exaggerated theoretical number. It also depends on standards - I had read that the highest % of missed recruitment goals were in the air assault brigades, which have very high standards compared to the average regarding age and fitness status. There is also the issue of corruption (with fake disability certificates issued, for example), and the replacement of the heads of recruitment centers is mainly due to this. It's definitely an issue that needs to be resolved.\n\nThere are a number of Ukrainians who join as contract soldiers for economic purposes too (the wages offered, thanks to Western financial support, are very generous compared to the average salary and therefore very attractive to, for example, a man with economic problems and/or who has lost his job). There's still a certain flow of volunteers, particularly from the under-27 age bracket that aren't subject to mobilization rules, although fewer than in the past (as when the brigades of the Offensive Guard were formed). Volunteers in their 20s are an extremely sought-after category for which there is much competition among Ukrainian brigades.\n\nRegarding support from the West - yes, indeed it's essential and is a prerequisite for the continuation of the war. No doubt about that. I take it for granted that it will continue, otherwise it would be a very, very serious issue. Numerous NATO's armies are having problems in terms of sending additional equipment, and the quality of new equipment is not always the highest, for example, the vast majority of the new tanks coming in the next few months are Leopard 1A5s, but let's remember that the Ukrainian Army had pulled T-64BMs or T-72AMTs out of its warehouses; MRAPs (which are available in large numbers) are a decent solution to equip mechanized units compared to BTR-70s or even BMP-1s (for not-muddy terrains). Even M113s are quite appreciated by Ukrainian soldiers as far as I read! It will be essential to continue sending artillery guns, especially 155mm pieces with which the Ukrainians can use the DPICMs and, from the next year, enjoy the increased production of 155mm shells in the Western countries.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>At the moment the Ukrainian Army (too) is probably at (or, at worst, very near) its peak since the beginning of the war, in terms of both personnel and gear. This is not to say that in several brigades there aren&#39;t serious operational capability problems after having suffered heavy losses, particularly in those employed in the counteroffensive in the South. But it was the same, for example, in May 2022: one has to distinguish a brigade in poor condition from the structural difficulties in mobilizing new recruits.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of mobilization in general, there are relevant problems, although the issue is very sensitive and magnified by Russian propaganda. Ukraine no longer has the huge amount of volunteers who joined the armed forces in the first weeks of the war, and the mobilization process, which continues, also faces greater problems than in the past. I seem to recall that during the winter months, in conjunction with the formation of the new brigades, Ukraine was able to mobilize 30k men a month. Now it&#39;s very difficult to maintain that pace. Certainly the issue of &quot;diminishing marginal returns&quot; during a mobilization exists and is a real problem, which can be improved with better training compared to what we&#39;ve seen so far. At the same time, I wouldn&#39;t be frightened off by certain articles and remember that the datas have to be compared to how realistic the expectations were - if a certain recruiting center recruited only a (rather small) % of what it wanted, it can be because either it actually recruited very little or because it had placed an exaggerated theoretical number. It also depends on standards - I had read that the highest % of missed recruitment goals were in the air assault brigades, which have very high standards compared to the average regarding age and fitness status. There is also the issue of corruption (with fake disability certificates issued, for example), and the replacement of the heads of recruitment centers is mainly due to this. It&#39;s definitely an issue that needs to be resolved.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of Ukrainians who join as contract soldiers for economic purposes too (the wages offered, thanks to Western financial support, are very generous compared to the average salary and therefore very attractive to, for example, a man with economic problems and/or who has lost his job). There&#39;s still a certain flow of volunteers, particularly from the under-27 age bracket that aren&#39;t subject to mobilization rules, although fewer than in the past (as when the brigades of the Offensive Guard were formed). Volunteers in their 20s are an extremely sought-after category for which there is much competition among Ukrainian brigades.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding support from the West - yes, indeed it&#39;s essential and is a prerequisite for the continuation of the war. No doubt about that. I take it for granted that it will continue, otherwise it would be a very, very serious issue. Numerous NATO&#39;s armies are having problems in terms of sending additional equipment, and the quality of new equipment is not always the highest, for example, the vast majority of the new tanks coming in the next few months are Leopard 1A5s, but let&#39;s remember that the Ukrainian Army had pulled T-64BMs or T-72AMTs out of its warehouses; MRAPs (which are available in large numbers) are a decent solution to equip mechanized units compared to BTR-70s or even BMP-1s (for not-muddy terrains).

I honestly don't see the need to create additional brigades, though. I think the current number is good after the creation spree during the winter and spring; the priority should be introducing additional battalions in the new ones, which are substantially smaller than most of the veteran ones. There are several new brigades of which nothing was ever heard about after the news that they were in training (primarily infantry brigades, a new type of formation). With the large number of brigades now in existence and rising recruiting issues, I think it's fair that the priority is to replenish losses in existing brigades. I'd have enjoyed seeing a divisional level being added but it doesn't seem to be a feasible thing.\n\nThe 47th has suffered very significant losses but is still in combat. We all know about the recent events concerning it. To my knowledge, some battalions of the brigade are in the rear recovering, while the rest are on the front lines in Robotyne. Marine brigades also suffered large losses, especially the 35th and 37th. I'm closely following the Velyka Novosilka sector, because it's possible that the grouping of the whole Ukrainian marine formations there could be no more. Partly because of losses, partly maybe the General Staff wants to deploy them elsewhere. Elements of the 36th would be back in Avdiivka, the 35th has been less active after the failed attack on Novomaiorske last month, the 37th has also been very little active, same goes for the 38th. Rybar said elements of the Ukrainian Marine Corps would have been transferred to Mykolaiv and Kherson Oblasts, according to him in preparation for a landing across the Dnipro that was later cancelled. Beyond the occasional hallucinatory states sometimes Rybar has to fall in (today he outdid himself with the Avdiivka affair, he wrote the Russians had taken Berdychi when there's no indication they passed the railway before Stepove in first place!!), it's indeed true that the marines are much less active than in the summer in the sector (and the 23rd and 31st Mech Brigades that were in the western bank of the Mokri Yaly seem to have been missing for months - Rybar wrote the first of these would have been spotted in the rear of the Orikhiv sector in the recent days). It's no coincidence that lately the western bank of Mokri Yaly has been taken over by several TD brigades while in the eastern one the fresh 58th Motorized Brigade and some battalions of the Presidential Brigade have very recently arrived.

Two, when Ukraine the breach happened Russia dedicated a significant amount of troops near the area were deployed ahead of the defense line resulting in higher casualties and not defending easier land.  Three, Russia has deployed many of its best units that could be used in an offensive to the south to stop Ukraine (Ukraine followed in kind).\n\nThis means while tactical goals in the area have always been maneuver warfare of taking areas that give Ukrainians good positions for offense/defense, the immediate strategic goal was to reach an area like Tokmak to prevent logistics from reaching the south, which in itself fulfills the largest strategic goal of a war of attrition.\n\nThe battles in the South are an absolute war of attrition.  Russia is trying to win this war, while at the same time appeasing higher command of not losing ground at the expense of not winning attrition as it should be easy for Russia to win it as the defender.

Also, the units Russia has deployed means they won't likely see a huge offensive like we saw last year.\n\nMy assessment (which obviously always hasn't been correct with predictions, but not always wrong), is the next month will make or break the war moving forward.  If Ukraine has really worn down Russian forces/supplies/reserves in the South, a breakthrough is guaranteed as long as Ukraine is able to continue to get the supplies currently or nearly being delivered.  When a breakthrough occurs Russia will likely withdraw as it did around Izyum, Kyiv, Kupisansk, and Kharkiv and pull back to the Donbass potentially even eventually out of Crimea.  Crimea cannot be held with the weapons Ukraine has now if the sea is reached by Ukraine.\n\nWe will likely see Russia's response to these as more massive mobilizations, continued war time economy, more threats of nukes, and will need some type of redeployment of fleet assets to protect Crimea if the sea is reached in the South (but I don't know what they can actually do with Turkey's agreement).",

Israel already has a large and competent air force and probably one of the more competent AD networks as well. Who are the opponents that Israel can't smack by itself easily enough that these carriers are supposed to deter? Carriers can't do ground operations after all, and I doubt they are going to be involved in CAS over Gaza. So what's the purpose?\n\nIs it just a matter of showing the flag / political support? But then why consider the second one? Is there an actual mission for these that would require 2 CSGs near Israel?",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I am curious what people think is the actual purpose of US CSG being sent over to Israel, and apparently the rumors of the second one being considered as well? <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/10/u-s-may-send-second-aircraft-carrier-toward-israel-00120793\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/10/u-s-may-send-second-aircraft-carrier-toward-israel-00120793</a> </p>\n\n<p>The official line seems to be:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The large deployment reflects a U.S. desire to deter any regional expansion of the conflict. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is fine but I am having hard time figuring out what it actually means. Israel already has a large and competent air force and probably one of the more competent AD networks as well. Who are the opponents that Israel can&#39;t smack by itself easily enough that these carriers are supposed to deter?

Those sites aren't credible because they're nobodies posting propaganda based on no reliable sources. \n\n>Like I said, the details aren't enough to conclusively show the exact location. \n\nSo why did you write that it was confirmed and settled? \n\n>Tell ya what, if you locate another Russian-occupied rail line in GMLRS range that matches the footage, or otherwise show the accounts that posted it are noncredible, I'll retract my statement as premature. \n\nAre you serious? That's how you think this works? I have to prove grainy trees and electric lines are positively located somewhere or else it means it has to be Tokmak? Nope, I don't think at all that's how it works.\n\n>It's on a rail line. You see the rail line. \n\nA rail line runs the length of where the trains can go. A RAIL STATION is in Tokmak. But Russia doesn't need a station inside tube artillery range of the front lines. Especially when multiple rail stations are in the towns on the direct road from Tokmak to Melitopol that the rail line handrails, that are further away and safer. \n\nBut they don't need a station at all to offload supplies as long as they can use ramps or other mobile equipment to unload them [which they definitely use](https://www.railfreight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Russia-Belarus-ammo-train.jpg). \n\nWhich has been my point all along. You're fixated on a station in a city that doesn't need to be used in a place it shouldn't be used because it'll be easily blown up. \n\n>This time though, I'm convinced I did my research and I don't believe you've shown otherwise. \n\nYou did your research? No you didn't. You created a theory months back that got upvoted because it was based on Russian incompetence and then yesterday you posted something you found on the internet that supported your existing theory, then used total conjecture to back it up, deciding it was confirmed and settled despite then saying you had doubts (which you should). \n\nThe whole reason I said the Tokmak station wasn't being used for rail offload in the first place, besides brigade and higher commands not even being that close to the front lines, was because THIS is exactly what would happen, daily. They'd get blown up. \n\nActually, scratch that, the UAF wouldn't even need to worry about any of the rail lines leading to near Tokmak to hit the trains with HIMARS because they could target a far fewer static locations called \"bridges\" that are all within M31 GMLRS range, and had been hit in the past, and cripple those \"bridges\" so trains can't move over them to get closer to Tokmak to offload within tube artillery range of the front lines. \n\nWhy is Tokmak important? \n\nBecause it has key roads going through it leading to key places. Not because it has a railway station that isn't even needed to offload supplies. \n\nLook at Bilmak to the east, also circumvallated with a 360 defense dug already, but doesn't even have a rail line going through it. But it does have two roads running through it, one to Mariupol and the other to Berdyansk, which is why it's valuable to hold. \n\nMeanwhile, Tokmak has three roads leading into it from the north and two leading south, one to Melitopol and the other to Berdyansk, which just so happens to be the key Ukraine objectives for this strategic offensive.

Being followed by an Oryx account means they find it to be a credible enough source for videos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, being followed means they are followed.

That&#39;s how you think this works? I have to prove grainy trees and electric lines are positively located somewhere or else it means it has to be Tokmak?

You see the rail line. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A rail line runs the length of where the trains can go. A RAIL STATION is in Tokmak. But Russia doesn&#39;t need a station inside tube artillery range of the front lines. Especially when multiple rail stations are in the towns on the direct road from Tokmak to Melitopol that the rail line handrails, that are further away and safer. </p>\n\n<p>But they don&#39;t need a station at all to offload supplies as long as they can use ramps or other mobile equipment to unload them <a href=\"https://www.railfreight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Russia-Belarus-ammo-train.jpg\">which they definitely use</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Which has been my point all along.

Gaza is about to face a storm they've never, ever seen before.\n\nTerrorists aren't some hydra analog that is somehow impossible to fully destroy.

Like the Palestinians, the Jews were seemingly innumerable. Impossible to contain due to sheer numbers. The Roman legions were massively outnumbered. But an absolutely brutal crackdown on the civilian population, combined with a lengthy siege of Bar Kokhba's fortress, took its toll. In the end, the Jews were scattered to the four winds, and Bar Kokhba's army was completely destroyed. As many as 400,000 men died, and many more civilians. That's what it takes to root out a revolt. And given that many considered Bar Kokhba the Messiah at the time, I'd say the religious ferver was even more intense for them than the Palestinians. But every population has its breaking point. You just need to find it.\n\nUp to now, IDF hasn't had the will to engage in such brutality. I think we need to understand that this time is different. Israel is not trying to look like the good guys here. They will never allow an attack like this to happen again.

I'm obviously saying that when discussions about WW2 pop out (be it TV shows, debates, etc.), while many acknowledge the suffering for civilians in WW2, I've never heard a single person (except for fascists or nazis) saying something like \"damn allies!!! you shouldn't have dropped bombs on civilians!! nazis were bad but you are better than them!!!\". This is something nobody would say. Are there people here remembering the deaths and sometimes grieving for those bombings? Surely. Is the common sense that the liberation shouldn't have happened because of civilian deaths? Do the populace of Normandy regrets the allied bombings that killed thousands of them but also lead to their liberation? I've never asked but I don't think so.\n\nI'm not saying that they're happy with it. I'm saying that they undestand that those bombings were necessary.\n\nToday I see a lot of people, even moderately pro-Israel people, saying that they shouldn't attack, because civilians will die, they're better than hamas and so on. I mean, if you agree that hamas is an existential threat to israel, you have to understand that there is no other option. And you shouldn't blame israel for collateral deaths (assuming that they won't do deliberate killings of civilians), you should blame hamas for putting their civilians in this situation.\n\nHope that this clarified the above comment.

The car might stop so they can get out and argue, or they might reverse back to park for a bit, but the end destination is the same, the only variable is when they reach it. \n\nThey both share a primary security threat, which is a resurgent Iran. Much like Anglo-French relations developed steadily over the 19th century from the ashes of the Napoleonic Wars given their collective security concerns and shared national interests, I see a parallel situation with the Saudis and Israelis. Even away from security, mutual economic co-operation is in their collective interest as are issues such as water and food security which are going to become bigger prioritises as climate change does its best to make the region inhabitable. \n\nMBS at the very least does not seem to care very much about the Palestinian Cause. Whether he is a geo-political prodigy or vacuous pretender is still to be settled, but at the very least he seems to think long-term. There is little to be gained from supporting Hamas outside of rousing up his subjects. Doing that tends to have unwanted side-effects such as radicalising them into terrorists. Like it or not, Israel is here to stay, something the Middle East is steadily coming to accept. He does not have total autonomy to pull on straight ahead, domestic opinion and internal politics will probably lead to a halt of this process in the short to medium term, but it does not remove the reality that Iran is the greatest threat to them both and that an alliance of convenience is in their collective interests. \n\nAlthough the United States essentially insures their security independently against the same foe, I'm sure Riyad and Tel Aviv will be concerned that they might not always be able to cash-in on that insurance given multiple American defence priorities and gradual reduction in force projection, i.e. if America is fighting over Taiwan or Korea, or a NATO member had invoked Article 5, the Saudis and Israelis would largely be left to fend for their own. In a similar vein we are seeing capitals across Europe rapidly reassessing their defensive priorities and spending. \n\nShort of total regime change and accompanying strategic realignment in Tehran, which looks as likely as Korean re-unification, or Israel entirely depopulating Gaza, I don't think much will significantly change in the long-term. Anyone expecting Saudi Arabia and Israel to become best pals overnight is foolish, and the United States has a crucial role to play on making sure things stay on course and they can get past their mutual distrust.

Marxism and communism was an ideological goal shared by countless millions of working and oppressed people throughout the world, particularly in former colonial states, and retained great influence within the worker movements of most states throughout the 20th century. Although the Soviet Union fell short in many ways compared to idealistic visions of what a socialist society should be like, it still represented a fundamental alternative to capitalist development models and the ultimate goal of a society in which workers controlled their own destiny. Although Marxism and communist politics has retreated significantly since the collapse of the USSR it is certainly not dead and in my opinion could easily return to prominence under the right conditions.\n\nSince China\u2019s Reform and Opening period under Deng Xiaoping, it has essentially integrated itself into the capitalist world system despite retaining some aspects of a socialist economy. Its market oriented reforms were probably necessary in my opinion, but they also stripped China of the revolutionary mantle it had under Mao that inspired millions across the world to look towards China as an ideological model to follow. Most people not alive in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s probably don\u2019t know this history, but for a period of time Maoist China was extremely influential within popular movements in both the Global North and South, and several important anti-colonial struggles used Maoist strategies and the Maoist ideological framework to wage national liberation war. Even today there are still several fairly large and active armed struggles and movements that are explicitly Maoist (Naxalites in India, Maoists in Nepal, and the Filipino communist insurgency). \n\nAlthough China no longer really represents a development path that opposes the capitalist world system, and also has lost most of its revolutionary and class struggle character, I think that the seeds are still there. Under the right conditions (a major resurgence of class struggle in China, a great crisis of the capitalist world system, climate breakdown, a change in the geopolitical circumstances surrounding China, and a revived socialist-economy faction of the CPC that enjoys mass popular support, to name some possibilities) these seeds could re-emerge and could reshape both Chinese political economy and its foreign policy. A return of China to its revolutionary Marxist roots would most likely strengthen its ideological appeal to the rest of the world, and link it to mass popular movements and worker organizations that are looking for a path away from capitalism.\n\nIn terms of Chinese economic power, here\u2019s the [American ambassador to China comparing it to the Soviet Union](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/global-insider/2023/04/28/china-is-infinitely-stronger-than-the-soviet-union-ever-was-00094266):\n\n>\u201dWhen I think about the power that the Soviet Union had from the late 1940s into the early 90s, it was nothing like the power and the strength that China is exhibiting on the world stage. That\u2019s why I think this comparison that people have made between the old Cold War and our present great power rivalry [with China] can be helpful at times to think about the comparisons, but they\u2019re not exact.\n\n>The Soviet Union was a colossal power. Its nuclear dimensions. Its military dimension when it had hundreds of thousands of troops in East Germany facing Americans in the Fulda Gap and on the north German plain. But the power of the People\u2019s Republic of China is infinitely stronger than the Soviet Union ever was. And it\u2019s based on the extraordinary strength of the Chinese economy \u2014 its science and technology research base, its innovative capacity, and its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific to be the dominant power in the future. I do think the challenge from China is more complex and more deeply rooted and a greater test for us going forward.\u201d\n\nChina is the largest trading partner of more than 120 countries. Its scientific and technological capacity, its gargantuan industrial base, its integration into the world economy (making it far harder to isolate than the USSR ever was), and the size of its economy make it significantly stronger and more resilient than the USSR.\n\nIn terms of military capabilities, I think China is currently weaker (relative to the capabilities of the United States) than the Soviet Union was throughout the Cold War. That being said, I don\u2019t think that situation will last. For one, China is focusing on becoming a great maritime power, something that the USSR never aspired to be. It has an enormous shipbuilding industry and the technical expertise to go with it. Maritime power is obviously the key to power projection and global military influence, so China rapidly increasing its naval power is a big deal. For the moment they seem to be focused on being able to compete for naval supremacy within the first island chain, but they also clearly have their ambitions for power projection further afield as evidenced by their rapidly growing aircraft carrier program. Their air power too is on the path to becoming stronger than the USSR\u2019s was - the Soviets never thought they could compete plane for plane with the US, so they focused on layered ground-based air defense systems to make up for that gap. But China\u2019s J-20 (after the US, only the 2nd country to field an indigenous 5th generation fighter jet) represents the possibility of China becoming a serious competitor to American air dominance. They\u2019re building J-20\u2019s quite fast. In the coming decades, depending on the strength of the Chinese economy, I can see the PLAAF becoming equivalent to or even surpassing - at least in numbers and technology - the USAF, something that the Soviets didn\u2019t even attempt to accomplish. \n\nAll in all, while China is probably weaker militarily than the Soviets were (in relative and historical terms to the US) they are on a trajectory to far surpass the limits of Soviet military power and power projection capabilities due to their rapidly expanding maritime and air systems and capabilities. And they are much stronger economically than the USSR ever was, and far more integrated into the global economy. Economics is the base for everything else, so China has a much stronger foundation.",

The primary struggle facing the US is that it needs to find a way to convert it's current position of global supremacy into an alliance where regional actors can share the load. If Europe can counter Russia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and Taiwan can counter China, and Israel and Saudi Arabia can counter Iran, then that takes a lot of the load off the US and the US can prioritize where additional resources need to be spent instead of having to be the first responder in every situation.\n\nThis current crisis in Israel is a good example. Israel, despite the doubts I've seen in recent days posted here by some, hasn't let their armed forces slip substantially and are fully prepared to deal with the current crisis. It's possible that something like a full occupation of Gaza might be beyond them, but it's unlikely that the situation is going to deteriorate into something where Israel's security is threatened and they need any meaningful help from the US or anyone else. If they need help from the US it will likely be in the form of additional ammo supplies, and arms supplier to the free world is a role that I'm sure the US would love to step into more fully as compared t defender of the free world.\n\nIn contrast, Ukraine was something Europe was wholly unprepared for that has required the US to take a leading role throughout the entire conflict, and it is a huge resource and attention drain on the United States because Europe wasn't equipped for something of this sort. (In fairness to Europe, the task was harder. Israel and Saudi Arabia would probably not be able to handle it alone either if something more analogous to Ukraine happened, like Iran invading Iraq.)\n\nBut the point is, at the end of the day, I don't see the current crisis in Israel as significantly impacting US readiness or control anywhere else.",

The problem is that the EU is in disarray, and is incapable of strong coordinated action in most issues. Macron likes to talk about European strategic autonomy, which means greater independence from the US, but with 27 squabbling countries, that&#39;s difficult to achieve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that Europe has the freedom to disagree with the US and try to pursue contrary policies is a strength of the US led world order, not a weakness, and indeed Europe has kept the JCPOA afloat, barely, after the US tried to kill it. It shows that the world isn&#39;t the US hegemony you think it is. But Europe is happy enough with the status quo that they don&#39;t feel the need to do things like (1) build up their armed forces to counter the US, (2) become independents from the US MIC, (3) distance their economies from the US economy so they are less reliant on the US, or (4) withdraw their currency reserves from the US. The reason is because they like the status quo.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a very misleading characterization of what&#39;s going on. The People&#39;s Republic of China inherited a whole set of territorial conflicts from the earlier Republic of China (which is why Taiwan shares many of the same territorial disputes and claims as the PRC). Some of these conflicts go back to the colonial era, when different lines were drawn by colonial powers. Some of them are due to the borders simply never having been agreed upon street the various countries became independent over the past century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Europe used to have these same problems, and they were the worse for it, but then they grew up, got over it, and have been better for it ever since. Maybe one day that will be China, but it sure isn&#39;t China today. China today got those territorial disputes from understandable places, but they have made no efforts to resolve them in an equitable manner and are instead pursuing maximalist goals on pretty much all of them, especially Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>\n\n<p>But they&#39;re the ones suffering from their foolishness, so who am I to tell them to stop making strategic blunder after strategic blunder.</p>\n</div>",

They've spent years training for an event like this. They have sniper teams, anti tank teams, sappers, drone operators, a complex tunnel network and potentially even anti Helicopter weaponry. Every incursion into Gaza was harder for the IDF than the last. I'll just copy paste this from Twitter.\n\nBoth the 2006 war against Hezbollah and the 2014 assault on Gaza followed the same pattern: \n1. Israel responded to a provocation with a military assault \n2. IDF ground forces stalled out against dug in enemy forces that had learned from previous engagements to fight up close and mitigate IDF's air & artillery advantage \n3.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Any military will struggle in Urban combat especially in a concrete labyrinth like Gaza. Hamas has studied the methods of ISIS, Hezbollah and even the Ukrainian army. They&#39;ve spent years training for an event like this. They have sniper teams, anti tank teams, sappers, drone operators, a complex tunnel network and potentially even anti Helicopter weaponry. Every incursion into Gaza was harder for the IDF than the last. I&#39;ll just copy paste this from Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Both the 2006 war against Hezbollah and the 2014 assault on Gaza followed the same pattern: \n1. Israel responded to a provocation with a military assault \n2. IDF ground forces stalled out against dug in enemy forces that had learned from previous engagements to fight up close and mitigate IDF&#39;s air &amp; artillery advantage \n3.

But let's not ask why it took so long and let's ask why now. The answer is: because Ukraine's relations with its neighbors are getting worse day by day. Of the 7 countries with which Ukraine borders, one is at war with, another is hostile to it, a third is the poorest country in Europe with zero possibilities of help, 2 have Putinist governments, and the last two are Romania and Poland. The last two countries are the only countries that have the possibility to help Ukraine economically and militarily the most, and they also did not have any ambiguity in this regard (apart from some specific situations). Ukraine must do everything possible to maintain the best possible relations with these two countries, and this also means that Ukraine must do its part. Unfortunately, from what I saw yesterday, apart from thanks for the help, Zelensky did not answer categorically when he was asked about Romania's requests regarding the solution of the so-called \"Moldovan languages\" and the improvement of the rights of the Romanian minorities in Ukraine. He even mentioned the fact that for him this is not a priority, and that the war is more important. I agree with the fact that the priority is the war, but you cannot come and say that you will not respond to the requests of a country that helps you and show an almost intransigent position and then expect that people from that country will continue to support sending money to you. Zelensky and Ukraine must learn to value their allies and stop alienating them with statements that give ammunition to extremist parties that vote to end military aid to Ukraine. Also, the EU is a community where compromises and negotiations are made between states, and if Ukraine does not understand this, even during a war in which it depends on the money of American and EU citizens, then it is a very negative signal regarding the possibility of integration within the EU\n\nEdit: I know Slovakia's government was not formed yet, but the party that won the election has a clear position on Ukraine.",

It's a difficult and sensitive matter on both sides of the border.\n\nRomania and Ukraine share not only the somewhat abstract territorial dispute about Snake Island (settled in 1997, in part because Romania needed to settle it as a prerequisite for NATO membership) but a historical dispute about several regions (the northern part of Bukovina, the southern part of Bessarabia, the Khotin and the Hertsa) which both view as territory that they have historical claims to. They were annexed by the USSR in World War II, when Romanian territory was partitioned, and was not restored. Relations between Romania and the Ukrainian SSR were also extremely tenuous during the Cold War.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the relations between the two countries were very rocky, both because of this historical rift and because Romania first post-communist regimes were, with a short and even then incomplete intermission between 1996 and 2000, largely led by former communist politicians who didn't fully shed their ideological training. \n\nRomanian leaders, partially concerned about stability at its borders, but also motivated by their desire to maintain good relations with Soviet authorities, were not quick to recognise Ukrainian independence and, prior to the Ukrainian independence referendum, they warned that, if Ukraine broke away, it would have to negotiate for the former Romanian territory it holds. They also initially refused to recognise the results of the Ukrainian independence referendum in these territories. Later on, in the 1990s, Romania attempted to block initial ouvertures made by the Ukrainian government towards further improving relations with its Central European neighbours and with Western European countries. For example, it boycotted the June 1996 meeting of Central European presidents; Ukraine was invited over the objections of the Czech Republic, but Romania was the only country that didn't participate.\n\nUkraine's current policy towards the Romanian language (and the Romanian minority in general) developed, in part, as an attempt to curb the influence of Romania in its territories, which it viewed not as a problem of ethnic rights per se, but as a potential threat from a state that, at one point, looked like it would exploit the instability of Soviet breakdown to annex some of its territory, after siding with hardline Soviet leaders and attempting to blackmail it on the eve of a referendum for independence. The idea of a conflict between Romania and Ukraine is obviously non-credible *now*, but this was 1991; ethnic conflict in the USSR's immediate vicinity was something everyone feared.\n\nIt was only in the late 1990s that relations began to thaw to some degree, as Romania had to settle its territorial disputes in order to join NATO. But the damage was already done, there's a whole generation of Romanians and Ukrainians who were brought up thinking that the other side is siding with their enemies to break up their country.\n\nGiving a \"categorical answer\" to the problem of the \"Moldovan languages\" absolutely isn't something that's going to happen overnight, it's a real electoral hurdle in some areas, just like aid for Ukraine was a real electoral hurdle for Romanian parties.",

America has had plenty of police brutality protests before, but the scale of the 2020 protests is particularly noteworthy, especially since a lot of them also happened in places (e.g. Lincoln, Nebraska) where there weren&#39;t many minorities living in them to begin with or weren&#39;t host to police departments known for police brutality. </p>\n\n<p>And the protests dissipated after a few months. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In any case, I think the role of street protests in the Arab world on this particular question will depend on how bloody the war in Gaza gets, as well as whether a feeling of solidarity with Palestinians will get connected to wider dissatisfaction with their ruling regimes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>True but I think the protesters might rather demand a change in government than asking the government to support Palestinians.</p>\n</div>",

An 80 year old who can't work and has large healthcare expenses is not the same as an undereducated 18 year old.  While both are a cost one is unlikely to ever be a net benefit economically while the other is likely to become one in time.

Getting a significant number of immigrants from cultures with higher fertility rates is likely to lead to an improvement in overall birthrates for a short period of time.  While the cost in the short term is high (again), the potential demographics benefit in terms of the age pyramid is potentially significant.  \n\nThird, increases in population tend to increase demand in economically beneficial ways so long as integration happens.

Spending drives local economic activity and can kickstart the economy.  \n\nA good example is Lewiston Maine in the USA.

Yes the immigration wave is still an overall net negative today - if you account for all city and state services necessary to cope with the immigration wave - but the fact that the poverty rate in the community has already fallen by a significant figure and the city is growing means that the wave is guaranteed to be a net positive in the (near) future.  And this is with a group of refugees from an effectively failed state with a previous lack of access to educational and health resources, and with a likely significantly higher than average rate of violence and trauma.

A closed community that has a different exclusionary culture, speaks a different language and maintains physical and cultural boundaries sounds more like a ghetto or neighboring country than a functioning part of society. </p>\n\n<p>Can you think of a hypothetical such diaspora that does contribute economically but that you also wouldn&#39;t call integrated? What features would it have and what behaviors should it engage in?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like that group prefers a sort of counter culture, but only to a relatively benign extent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They often engage in human trafficking to avoid having children with the locals because they see the Japanese as genetically inferior. Incidentally, would <em>that</em> make them unintegrated in your eyes? It does in mine, but I&#39;d like to hear your perspective.</p>\n</div>",

I don't see them pushing Gaza into the sea via bulldozers Tomorrow, or next week, or next year. Nor do I see the people getting starved out. \n\nTwenty years and nothing's changed. Is it a failure of imagination? Or is it two sides that can't ever see eye to eye.   \n\n\nUltimately, the last week has shown how dangerous the situation and Hamas is. Pushing them back, building the wall higher will only lead to this again. I said a few days ago, they made a giant mistake with the violence, and brutality of the incursion. They burned a lot of good will. I don't think a lot of people are too pleased with what has happened. I think emotions and tensions are running high. Yes, people should be baying for blood. Yes, they should be wanting to kill them all, and let god sort them out. Those actions should be repulsive, people should react like that, it's natural shock and anger. \n\nThe devil's in the details. Emotions will settle, and simmer down. A lot of the bluster and rhetoric will settle, and I think a diplomatic settlement or agreement on humanitarian concerns will occur in a few weeks.  I said in another post that it is a great easy diplomatic win for someone. \n\nI think that ultimately, there will need to be some sort of longer term solution. I don't know what it is, does Gaza become a UN Trust? Is it placed under Jordanian administration?

I don&#39;t see them pushing Gaza into the sea via bulldozers Tomorrow, or next week, or next year. Nor do I see the people getting starved out. </p>\n\n<p>Twenty years and nothing&#39;s changed. Is it a failure of imagination? Or is it two sides that can&#39;t ever see eye to eye.   </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the last week has shown how dangerous the situation and Hamas is. Pushing them back, building the wall higher will only lead to this again. I said a few days ago, they made a giant mistake with the violence, and brutality of the incursion. They burned a lot of good will. I don&#39;t think a lot of people are too pleased with what has happened. I think emotions and tensions are running high. Yes, people should be baying for blood. Yes, they should be wanting to kill them all, and let god sort them out. Those actions should be repulsive, people should react like that, it&#39;s natural shock and anger. </p>\n\n<p>The devil&#39;s in the details. Emotions will settle, and simmer down. A lot of the bluster and rhetoric will settle, and I think a diplomatic settlement or agreement on humanitarian concerns will occur in a few weeks.  I said in another post that it is a great easy diplomatic win for someone. </p>\n\n<p>I think that ultimately, there will need to be some sort of longer term solution. I don&#39;t know what it is, does Gaza become a UN Trust? Is it placed under Jordanian administration?  Until the governance structure is resolved, until Hamas is removed from power, there isn&#39;t much room to maneuver.</p>\n</div>",

The preparatory and assaulting fires from airstrikes, artillery, and mortars creates rubble that in turn makes the terrain easier to defend and harder to attack. The rubble blocks vehicle movements and, in many cases, creates even stronger fortifications than the buildings provided while standing. The commanding officer of the US mission in support of the Iraqi Army during the final battle to liberate Mosul in 2017, Gen. Stephen Townsend, described it by saying, \u201cThe buildings had been turned into bunkers. Imagine a five-story building and the top four floors are gone. They\u2019re rubble now and that rubble is twenty and thirty feet deep on top of the first floor and the basement floor. . . . You couldn\u2019t build a better bomb-proof shelter than that. If you tried to erect it, it would be easier to penetrate that with our munitions than the accidental bunkers created by rubble.\u201d\n\nhttps://mwi.westpoint.edu/city-not-neutral-urban-warfare-hard/\n> Urban defenders must shape the terrain to facilitate their obstacles, engagement areas, ambushes, and battle positions. The sheer amount of military grade fortification material (e.g., concrete) gives an urban defender a great advantage. Some of the main goals of an urban defense are to funnel attacking forces into engagement areas, canalize them down a small number of avenues of approach, and constrain their ability to maneuver and mass forces. A method to accomplish this\u2014and it is understood to be controversial, given the amount of destruction it generates\u2014is to create rubble by destroying structures to produce broken concrete, rebar, stones, bricks, or solid material to include debris. Rubbled buildings can occur in urban warfare from an attacker\u2019s preparatory fires (aerial bombing, artillery, and mortars) but they can also be created purposely by defenders to block avenues of approach by partially or completely destroying buildings using demolitions and fires or simply moving existing rubble.\nFrom September to December 1943 Wehrmacht engineers in Ortona, Italy extensively rubbled the buildings to support the German defense of the city. They blew down corners of houses, entire houses, or even lines of houses to create rubble piles up to fifteen feet high, which were then liberally sown with mines and booby traps. This rubble blocked narrower, ox cart\u2013width secondary streets to force the attacking Canadians down the main thoroughfare and into the main German defensive area. It also made it nearly impossible for supporting tanks to climb over the piles or maneuver to support the dismounted infantry and engineers, and even blocked Canadian observation down the roads.\n\nhttps://mwi.westpoint.edu/defending-the-city-an-overview-of-defensive-tactics-from-the-modern-history-of-urban-warfare/",

If you tried to erect it, it would be easier to penetrate that with our munitions than the accidental bunkers created by rubble.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mwi.westpoint.edu/city-not-neutral-urban-warfare-hard/\">https://mwi.westpoint.edu/city-not-neutral-urban-warfare-hard/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Urban defenders must shape the terrain to facilitate their obstacles, engagement areas, ambushes, and battle positions. The sheer amount of military grade fortification material (e.g., concrete) gives an urban defender a great advantage. Some of the main goals of an urban defense are to funnel attacking forces into engagement areas, canalize them down a small number of avenues of approach, and constrain their ability to maneuver and mass forces. A method to accomplish this\u2014and it is understood to be controversial, given the amount of destruction it generates\u2014is to create rubble by destroying structures to produce broken concrete, rebar, stones, bricks, or solid material to include debris. Rubbled buildings can occur in urban warfare from an attacker\u2019s preparatory fires (aerial bombing, artillery, and mortars) but they can also be created purposely by defenders to block avenues of approach by partially or completely destroying buildings using demolitions and fires or simply moving existing rubble.\nFrom September to December 1943 Wehrmacht engineers in Ortona, Italy extensively rubbled the buildings to support the German defense of the city. They blew down corners of houses, entire houses, or even lines of houses to create rubble piles up to fifteen feet high, which were then liberally sown with mines and booby traps. This rubble blocked narrower, ox cart\u2013width secondary streets to force the attacking Canadians down the main thoroughfare and into the main German defensive area. It also made it nearly impossible for supporting tanks to climb over the piles or maneuver to support the dismounted infantry and engineers, and even blocked Canadian observation down the roads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mwi.westpoint.edu/defending-the-city-an-overview-of-defensive-tactics-from-the-modern-history-of-urban-warfare/\">https://mwi.westpoint.edu/defending-the-city-an-overview-of-defensive-tactics-from-the-modern-history-of-urban-warfare/</a></p>\n</div>",

However even if the babies where \u201conly shot\u201d, everything that has happened in Israel (of which we do have video proof) is already vile enough.</p>\n\n<p>However it is important to be cautious at this point, many people are rightfully emotional about this attack and that means that horrorstories that fit the overall narrative might end up being shared without further proof.</p>\n\n<p>But based on what I have seen so far, It wouldn\u2019t surprise me If the accusations are true.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>changed: &quot;definitely publicized imo.&quot; to &quot;definitely not publicized imo.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Missed a not there, sorry.</p>\n</div>",

Yes, Russia is having trouble with Ukraine due to its own corruption and questionable tactics and intelligence failures, but you have to keep in mind Russia is fighting a direct high intensity war with Ukraine and a Proxy war with the West (US/NATO) at the same time. No other countries outside of China and the US are capable of that. It is fighting them through sanctions and a half assed invasion plan to begin with. All things considered, they are doing OK  while facing 70% of the financial world and close to no outside help for this long.
