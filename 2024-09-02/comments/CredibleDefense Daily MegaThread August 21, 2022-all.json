Every NATO member has a veto, so if you only need a \"negative\" agreement, you just need to convince one NATO member.\n\n> from the looks of things they didn't make much effort to negotiate\n\nEh. The biggest problem was that Russia was publicly demanding that NATO withdraws from its Eastern members, which was *never ever* going to happen.

To schematize:\n\n1. Russia wants to re-absorb Ukraine.\n2. Were Ukraine to join NATO, it would become unlikely for Russia to re-absorb Ukraine.\n3. Therefore, the prospect of Ukrainian accession to NATO is an issue because it would foreclose Russia's long-term policy of re-absorbing Ukraine.\n\n>As a sovereign state Ukraine is free to plot its course as it sees fit.\n\nOnly according to international law.\n\n>Because Russia has a puppet leading the country.\n\nAgreed.

                        "body": "That arrangement would require the Ukrainians to trust the Russians to make payments consistently. Hell, it would require the Russians to actually make those payments consistently, which would be horribly out of character for them even before they demolished their own economy and guaranteed Europe will never buy gas from them again.\n\nWorse yet, it gives the Russians a long term opportunity to consolidate control, which in turn will make it even harder to reintegrate Crimea into Ukraine. The Russians will be able to use Crimea to project power into the Black Sea where they can interfere with Ukrainian shipping and oil platforms. Worse, it gives the Russians control over potentially trillions of dollars in undersea oil and gas reserves, with plenty of time for them to deplete the fields completely before turning them back over to Ukraine). Plus they can use it as a base for future military incursions into Ukrainian territory. Granting the Russians a lease or otherwise legally accepting their sovereignty over Crimea risks legitimizing and therefore encouraging Russian seizure of territory by force.\n\nAll in exchange for what? An inconsistent and unreliable revenue stream from an enemy nation with a crippled economy and a long history of screwing over their international partners (including and especially Ukraine)? Freedom from having to rebuild this one specific, largely unscathed region (in terms of direct combat damage to civilian infrastructure, at least), when they already need to rebuild their entire country? And really all they would be doing is shifting the cost of rebuilding to Russia under your proposal, which would be a pretty fucking ballsy position for the Russians to take. Instead of paying reparations for the damages they caused and letting Ukraine figure out how to allocate those funds as one might expect in a just world, they would retain control over territory and reap any economic benefits from the region's post-war recovery.\n\nAll of that to avoid having to deal with a civil unrest from a local population that *apparently* doesn't want to be in Ukraine, after the Russians seized the region by force and engaged in extreme suppression of dissenting opinions? \n\nRemember the Sino-British agreement on the handover of Hong Kong happened in 1984 when the UK was at the tail end of 20 years of actively and aggressively implementing a policy of decolonization. While the initial 99-year lease itself is from 1898, making it a lease instead of a grant was really a face-saving concession for the Qing Emperor, who had little choice in the matter. The British negotiators considered 99 years \"as good as forever,\" so it was more of an accident than an intentional policy choice, and only the anti-colonial sentiments of the 1980s and a decline in British military dominance (compared to the pre-war era) ensured the British would respect the lease expiration. And although they wanted to let go of their colonial holdings, they did not want to grant control to communist or authoritarian governments that might persecute the citizens of the colonies. Meaning, respecting the lease was a compromise between the British anticolonialist and anticommunist factions, with the hope being that delaying Chinese control until the lease expired would allow for a softening in the communist regime (which it did, the modern Chinese government is infinitely better run and less oppressive than it was under Mao, although still pretty damn oppressive by western standards). The idea being Chinese control of HK was right and proper but the government simply was not yet ready to take that control. \n\nThere is no equivalent to the anticolonialist faction in Ukraine or in Russia. No one serious on the Ukrainian side is arguing that Russia has a moral or legal right to control Crimea but that granting control right now is not appropriate because the Russian government isn't trustworthy. Nor is anyone on the Russian side arguing that about the Ukrainians. Unlike with Hong Kong, where there was widespread recognition that the island is naturally and historically part of China until it was illegitimately seized by force during the Opium Wars, and therefore should be subject to Chinese government. Nor are there tremendous differences in Russian and Ukrainian governmental competence or social policies (to the extent that there are, it would make more sense for the Russians to be leasing Crimea to the Ukrainians). Thus, there is no reason for either side to pursue a solution designed to incrementally transition control to the other.\n\nThe Russians also only conquered Crimea eight years ago. The British had controlled Hong Kong for 140 years by the time they agreed in 1984 to transition control to the Chinese government when the lease expired in 1997. Before then, Hong Kong was a cluster of sparsely populated and largely economically irrelevant fishing villages. The British built it up into a major trading hub and commercial center, with a large population consisting of both non-Chinese and Chinese residents who were accustomed to (and for the most seemingly happy) living under British law in a hybrid Chinese-British society. An unmanaged transition to Chinese rule would have destroyed that society and the economic powerhouse it enabled. \n\nIn contrast, the Russians have if anything caused extreme damage to the Crimean economy, especially agriculture. They haven't had 140 years to build up institutions and laws and practices that would be undone by transferring control back to Ukraine. And the local population never got a real say in whether they want to be part of Russia, considering the referendum didn't even have a real option to stay in Ukraine and was only initiated by the Crimean parliament when they were literally being held at gunpoint by Russian soldiers. And it should come as no surprise to anyone that residents report agreeing with the results of the referendum when contacted by private pollsters. It's hard to give your honest opinion when the little green men are disappearing dissenters. I mean, [it's literally a crime in Russia to say Crimea should be returned to Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation#Transition_and_aftermath). So of course people aren't going to say that it should be.\n\nWhich is really the whole point: it would be utterly insane to act as if we know the local population's true preferences, as expressed in elections without international monitors or in private polling conducted without the ability to guarantee the safety and anonymity of the respondents, after the seizure of the territory by force and its occupation by a government with no respect for democracy and a long history of persecuting political dissenters. Especially after that government passed laws making it illegal for people to express the opposite preference, and even more especially after many instances of attacks on and trumped up prosecutions of pro-Ukrainian journalists and activists in Crimea. \n\nI think you'll find there won't be much civil unrest if the Ukrainians successfully retake the peninsula by force. In a Russian-controlled information environment, the locals may express a preference for Russia. But I think without the obscuring effects of propaganda they will develop a clear image of how badly the Russians have lost this war, especially when provided a sharp lesson about Ukrainian military superiority with their front row seats to any counteroffensive. That will in turn highlight the fundamentally rotten nature of Russian government, showing Crimeans the relative advantages of Ukrainian rule and undermining whatever legitimate local support for Russian annexation exists there.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>That arrangement would require the Ukrainians to trust the Russians to make payments consistently. Hell, it would require the Russians to actually make those payments consistently, which would be horribly out of character for them even before they demolished their own economy and guaranteed Europe will never buy gas from them again.</p>\n\n<p>Worse yet, it gives the Russians a long term opportunity to consolidate control, which in turn will make it even harder to reintegrate Crimea into Ukraine. The Russians will be able to use Crimea to project power into the Black Sea where they can interfere with Ukrainian shipping and oil platforms. Worse, it gives the Russians control over potentially trillions of dollars in undersea oil and gas reserves, with plenty of time for them to deplete the fields completely before turning them back over to Ukraine). Plus they can use it as a base for future military incursions into Ukrainian territory. Granting the Russians a lease or otherwise legally accepting their sovereignty over Crimea risks legitimizing and therefore encouraging Russian seizure of territory by force.</p>\n\n<p>All in exchange for what? An inconsistent and unreliable revenue stream from an enemy nation with a crippled economy and a long history of screwing over their international partners (including and especially Ukraine)? Freedom from having to rebuild this one specific, largely unscathed region (in terms of direct combat damage to civilian infrastructure, at least), when they already need to rebuild their entire country? And really all they would be doing is shifting the cost of rebuilding to Russia under your proposal, which would be a pretty fucking ballsy position for the Russians to take. Instead of paying reparations for the damages they caused and letting Ukraine figure out how to allocate those funds as one might expect in a just world, they would retain control over territory and reap any economic benefits from the region&#39;s post-war recovery.</p>\n\n<p>All of that to avoid having to deal with a civil unrest from a local population that <em>apparently</em> doesn&#39;t want to be in Ukraine, after the Russians seized the region by force and engaged in extreme suppression of dissenting opinions? </p>\n\n<p>Remember the Sino-British agreement on the handover of Hong Kong happened in 1984 when the UK was at the tail end of 20 years of actively and aggressively implementing a policy of decolonization. While the initial 99-year lease itself is from 1898, making it a lease instead of a grant was really a face-saving concession for the Qing Emperor, who had little choice in the matter. The British negotiators considered 99 years &quot;as good as forever,&quot; so it was more of an accident than an intentional policy choice, and only the anti-colonial sentiments of the 1980s and a decline in British military dominance (compared to the pre-war era) ensured the British would respect the lease expiration.

This cycle is repeated day after day until the Russian forces are able to finally advance. </p>\n\n<p>I have to imagine that the Russian forces involved in these &quot;reconnaisance&quot; efforts are suffering attrition every time, and probably not insignificant losses either.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "What we are seeing now is the Ukrainians trying to learn how to fight like NATO (which involves many shaping operations before initiating an offensive and is thus relatively slow to get started), but with far fewer advanced western weapons systems and platforms, with fewer soldiers trained on those systems, and without a reliable logistics system for sustaining them. That doesn't mean it won't work, just that it will take longer than the equivalent operation would for a better equipped military that already had all the necessary ingredients for a successful combined arms offensive in place. \n\nBasically, we are witnessing the real time NATOification of the Ukrainian military. The UAF never drilled on combined arms offensives before the war, nor were they well-equipped for such offensives then. So they need to learn how to use western-provided weapons systems suitable for offensives, and then learn how to blend those individual systems together as part of a combined arms force, all while figuring out the logistics to sustain these unfamiliar western systems and supply a highly mobile counteroffensive force on the move. \n\nUnsurprisingly, that entails also adopting some of the western approach to combined arms offensives, because the systems are designed to be used in a manner consonant with that approach. And also likely because western nations are providing training, intelligence, and advice that influence how the UAF fights, and are pressuring the Ukrainian civilian and military leadership to avoid adopting the Russian meatgrinder approach to war because that would not be politically acceptable in the west. The west is extremely averse to incurring casualties or to inflicting civilian casualties, and so western militaries pretty much always engage in extended precision bombing campaigns to degrade enemy positions and logistics before risking any ground troops in an offensive. In the Gulf War, the invasion of Afghanistan, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and many other recent conflicts, western forces have waited to launch a ground offensive until precision bombing almost made it completely unnecessary. And in Kosovo, the bombing actually did make a ground invasion completely unnecessary. Sometimes those campaigns have gone on for extremely long periods of time (years in the case of Iraq pre-2003), because it often takes a long time to chip away at a large ground force from a distance like that. It costs more in terms of time (and much more in dollars) but much less in terms of friendly casualties. Precision weaponry also minimizes collateral damage to civilian infrastructure compared with the Russian style of artillery-centric warfare. So it's not surprising the Ukrainians are taking this approach, nor that it is taking a while to translate into ground offensives. \n\nAlso the Ukrainians certainly have not just settled on only one totally inflexible plan for a counteroffensive. They are absolutely considering all their options and updating their plans in light of ongoing developments on the battlefield. Whether those plans mean attacking along the Zaporizhzhia front, or toward Izyum, Donetsk, or the international border north of Karkhiv. Or just not attacking at all and continuing to degrade Russian forces on the southern axis with the near impunity granted by their massive advantage in terms of quality PGMs and ISR assets. \n\nWhichever objective the UAF ultimately selects, the Russians have to move their troops longer distances than the Ukrainians to shift forces around between Kherson and the east or north. The Russian GLOCs connecting the regions are much more vulnerable to Ukrainian interdiction than vice versa. So Ukraine pivoting back and forth between different axes wastes precious and limited Russian logistical resources (trains and trucks that could be carrying necessary supplies to the front are instead used to move troops and equipment around between sections of the front) and subjects their troops to an asymmetric threat of attrition (they get HIMARS'd while unloading a train in Melitopol, where the Ukrainians don't need to worry because the Russians can't seem to hit any target behind the lines that isn't civilian). Best of all, the Ukrainians get this benefit almost for free. They don't need to actually counterattack, but can simply position their reserve forces to *threaten* a counterattack, and then reposition them later when a better opportunity to counterattack appears elsewhere, or even if they just want to make the Russians move a bunch of troops around for no reason. \n\nMeaning, it's not like this bombing campaign against the southern axis is intended *only* to enable a counteroffensive against Kherson. No plan survives contact with the enemy after all, and there was no way the Ukrainians could have known with any certainty that the Russians would redeploy 20-40 BTGs (so like a third of their committed combat power) to the southern axis in response to the UAF PGM and drone campaign there kicking off a few weeks ago. The Ukrainians certainly would have anticipated some reinforcements, and would (I hope) have planned for a broad range of reinforcement scenarios covering no reinforcements to a large scale counter-counteroffensive following full Russian mobilization. But it's not like the UAF general staff laid out an elaborately detailed plan in June to launch a ground attack on Kherson on some specific day in August after some precisely defined time for a bombing campaign, regardless of how the realities on the ground evolve. Instead, they saw weakness on the Russian southern flank and attacked it as soon as they received the equipment needed to do so safely and at range, with the ultimate goal of creating an opportunity to exploit on the ground.  \n\nIf that campaign lays the groundwork for a counteroffensive, that's a big win but it's not a sine qua non for the campaign to have been a Ukrainian success. At a bare minimum, they have eased pressure on their troops in the Donbas. It would not totally surprise me if that was the only concrete strategic objective behind the decision to focus on the south, with all the rest just being nice-to-haves. But even beyond that minimal floor for success, the UAF forced the Russians to move substantial assets into an area where they are much more vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks, because the Russian supply lines in the Crimean land bridge are longer and are subject to Ukrainian interdiction for longer stretches than those in the east. \n\nEven the simple act of moving Russian troops into the region necessarily entailed creating large concentrations of potential targets at staging grounds within HIMARS range, because the Russian train-based, manual-labor-intensive logistics system is not well suited to dispersion. Though now that the Russians have completed the transfer of troops and equipment, they seem to have dispersed them at least somewhat to limit vulnerability to HIMARS and other strikes. Instead, we are starting to see the Ukrainians destroying increasing numbers of high value rear area targets like SAMs and EW vehicles that had previously been largely out of range or not worth targeting relative to the large ammo dumps, airfields, and equipment depots we have been seeing targeted over the last two months. \n\nAs long as the daily costs to the Russians remain disproportionately high, the strategy is working. The increasing dispersion of Russian supplies may reduce the immediate return on these strikes, though (not counting the benefits of forcing the dispersion in the first place). Especially if the Russians pull back their high value targets beyond Ukrainian PGM range, as they have with their air forces in Crimea, or if the Ukrainians simply destroy enough of them that they have difficulty finding additional targets. But that might in fact be precisely what the Ukrainians are waiting for. How long can the Russians hold their static defensive positions when they have no or limited gas and ammo for tanks and arty because their dumps have been blown or scattered, no EW to counter UAF drones, no active radar for SAMs or counterbattery artillery because of HARM, no air support because no SAMs means their planes are totally exposed even when lobbing dumb bombs from low altitude behind their own lines, no PGMs because Russia can't make them, and no commanding officers because the CPs have been destroyed or the officers fled out of range? At that point, they'll be down to poorly equipped and supplied infantry in fixed fighting positions trying to hold without any leaders there to stiffen their backbones. If the Ukrainians can't mount an offensive against *that*, then I will start to be a little confused and concerned. But taking a long time to shape the battlefield in that way is pretty much classic NATO, so I think it's not lack of offensive capability that we are seeing here, but rather intentional delay during shaping operations.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>What we are seeing now is the Ukrainians trying to learn how to fight like NATO (which involves many shaping operations before initiating an offensive and is thus relatively slow to get started), but with far fewer advanced western weapons systems and platforms, with fewer soldiers trained on those systems, and without a reliable logistics system for sustaining them. That doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t work, just that it will take longer than the equivalent operation would for a better equipped military that already had all the necessary ingredients for a successful combined arms offensive in place. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, we are witnessing the real time NATOification of the Ukrainian military. The UAF never drilled on combined arms offensives before the war, nor were they well-equipped for such offensives then. So they need to learn how to use western-provided weapons systems suitable for offensives, and then learn how to blend those individual systems together as part of a combined arms force, all while figuring out the logistics to sustain these unfamiliar western systems and supply a highly mobile counteroffensive force on the move. </p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, that entails also adopting some of the western approach to combined arms offensives, because the systems are designed to be used in a manner consonant with that approach. And also likely because western nations are providing training, intelligence, and advice that influence how the UAF fights, and are pressuring the Ukrainian civilian and military leadership to avoid adopting the Russian meatgrinder approach to war because that would not be politically acceptable in the west. The west is extremely averse to incurring casualties or to inflicting civilian casualties, and so western militaries pretty much always engage in extended precision bombing campaigns to degrade enemy positions and logistics before risking any ground troops in an offensive. In the Gulf War, the invasion of Afghanistan, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and many other recent conflicts, western forces have waited to launch a ground offensive until precision bombing almost made it completely unnecessary. And in Kosovo, the bombing actually did make a ground invasion completely unnecessary. Sometimes those campaigns have gone on for extremely long periods of time (years in the case of Iraq pre-2003), because it often takes a long time to chip away at a large ground force from a distance like that. It costs more in terms of time (and much more in dollars) but much less in terms of friendly casualties. Precision weaponry also minimizes collateral damage to civilian infrastructure compared with the Russian style of artillery-centric warfare. So it&#39;s not surprising the Ukrainians are taking this approach, nor that it is taking a while to translate into ground offensives. </p>\n\n<p>Also the Ukrainians certainly have not just settled on only one totally inflexible plan for a counteroffensive. They are absolutely considering all their options and updating their plans in light of ongoing developments on the battlefield. Whether those plans mean attacking along the Zaporizhzhia front, or toward Izyum, Donetsk, or the international border north of Karkhiv. Or just not attacking at all and continuing to degrade Russian forces on the southern axis with the near impunity granted by their massive advantage in terms of quality PGMs and ISR assets. </p>\n\n<p>Whichever objective the UAF ultimately selects, the Russians have to move their troops longer distances than the Ukrainians to shift forces around between Kherson and the east or north. The Russian GLOCs connecting the regions are much more vulnerable to Ukrainian interdiction than vice versa. So Ukraine pivoting back and forth between different axes wastes precious and limited Russian logistical resources (trains and trucks that could be carrying necessary supplies to the front are instead used to move troops and equipment around between sections of the front) and subjects their troops to an asymmetric threat of attrition (they get HIMARS&#39;d while unloading a train in Melitopol, where the Ukrainians don&#39;t need to worry because the Russians can&#39;t seem to hit any target behind the lines that isn&#39;t civilian). Best of all, the Ukrainians get this benefit almost for free. They don&#39;t need to actually counterattack, but can simply position their reserve forces to <em>threaten</em> a counterattack, and then reposition them later when a better opportunity to counterattack appears elsewhere, or even if they just want to make the Russians move a bunch of troops around for no reason. </p>\n\n<p>Meaning, it&#39;s not like this bombing campaign against the southern axis is intended <em>only</em> to enable a counteroffensive against Kherson. No plan survives contact with the enemy after all, and there was no way the Ukrainians could have known with any certainty that the Russians would redeploy 20-40 BTGs (so like a third of their committed combat power) to the southern axis in response to the UAF PGM and drone campaign there kicking off a few weeks ago. The Ukrainians certainly would have anticipated some reinforcements, and would (I hope) have planned for a broad range of reinforcement scenarios covering no reinforcements to a large scale counter-counteroffensive following full Russian mobilization. But it&#39;s not like the UAF general staff laid out an elaborately detailed plan in June to launch a ground attack on Kherson on some specific day in August after some precisely defined time for a bombing campaign, regardless of how the realities on the ground evolve. Instead, they saw weakness on the Russian southern flank and attacked it as soon as they received the equipment needed to do so safely and at range, with the ultimate goal of creating an opportunity to exploit on the ground.  </p>\n\n<p>If that campaign lays the groundwork for a counteroffensive, that&#39;s a big win but it&#39;s not a sine qua non for the campaign to have been a Ukrainian success.

            "body": "Not every NATO military has the same type of enlisted system but many share a professional NCO corps where they are empowered and given additional duties and responsibilities separate from the commissioned officer corps, having basically stolen them in the past. The officer corps has no issues with this as the NCO corps (below first sergeant/sergeant major) are professional subject matter experts, taking off pressure of needing to rely on brand new second Lieutenants for that role, and they can spend less time focusing on troop leadership and discipline matters because the NCO corps, especially senior NCOs (first sergeant/sergeant major) who really do nothing but focus on that stuff.\n\nAll that said, the biggest difference is that in some western militaries there are things that commissioned officers don't and aren't supposed to be involved in. Individual training, individual discipline, low level leadership, that's all \"NCO business,\" and in many NATO militaries if a commissioned officer tries to usurp those roles they will create conflict within their unit and get chewed out by senior officers. Overall, that level of give and take made it simpler for the commissioned officers to command, and it made them more productive at the small unit, especially using advanced small unit tactics, techniques and procedures that involved skill and initiative.\n\nThe Russian Czarist military and then the Red Army both had a long standing old fashioned type NCO Corps but it was removed in a major Soviet military reform in the 1950s designed to streamline the Soviet military for mass mobilization and fighting WW3. At that point all enlisted were two year conscripts, including junior NCOs. Senior NCO ranks were abolished and made into warrant officers, but they had no troop leading responsibilities. Commissioned officers remained as the de facto leaders in any unit, with conscript NCOs only assisting at the squad level. That meant officers needed to be much higher trained and motivated, but they didn't think that was a problem. And because their system emphasized followed in-depth orders from higher level commanders, they didn't need or want an empowered NCO corps, they just needed to be competent enough to take the slack off of the platoon leaders, which meant an extra two months of leadership training for slightly above average trainees (the better ones already having been selected to attend officer academies).\n\nIn 2009, the Russian military introduced the New Look reforms where they greatly revamped their manpower and personnel system. Conscription was shortened from two years to one year. Enlisted contract troops replaced most conscripts in positions needing knowledge, motivation, and discipline. \"Enlisted professionals\" were made into a newly functioning NCO corps that included senior NCO ranks at the company level (first replacing and then augmenting warrant officer positions). However, they still never  decentralized their leadership so officers still have all the responsibilities and duties, like discipline, leadership, training, planning, and can't/won't rely on their NCO corps like the West. \n\nDue to recruitment issues, funding shortfalls due to 2014 sanctions, inconsistent training, discipline and corruption problems, the reforms weren't fully developed before this war started. Among ground forces, the VDV, Spetsnaz, and some better motor rifle and tank brigades in better military districts had a budding NCO corps but the rank and file units didn't. And then the ones who had them got very hurt by casualties, as NCOs and junior officers always take extremely heavy casualties in every conflict.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Not every NATO military has the same type of enlisted system but many share a professional NCO corps where they are empowered and given additional duties and responsibilities separate from the commissioned officer corps, having basically stolen them in the past. The officer corps has no issues with this as the NCO corps (below first sergeant/sergeant major) are professional subject matter experts, taking off pressure of needing to rely on brand new second Lieutenants for that role, and they can spend less time focusing on troop leadership and discipline matters because the NCO corps, especially senior NCOs (first sergeant/sergeant major) who really do nothing but focus on that stuff.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, the biggest difference is that in some western militaries there are things that commissioned officers don&#39;t and aren&#39;t supposed to be involved in. Individual training, individual discipline, low level leadership, that&#39;s all &quot;NCO business,&quot; and in many NATO militaries if a commissioned officer tries to usurp those roles they will create conflict within their unit and get chewed out by senior officers. Overall, that level of give and take made it simpler for the commissioned officers to command, and it made them more productive at the small unit, especially using advanced small unit tactics, techniques and procedures that involved skill and initiative.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian Czarist military and then the Red Army both had a long standing old fashioned type NCO Corps but it was removed in a major Soviet military reform in the 1950s designed to streamline the Soviet military for mass mobilization and fighting WW3. At that point all enlisted were two year conscripts, including junior NCOs. Senior NCO ranks were abolished and made into warrant officers, but they had no troop leading responsibilities. Commissioned officers remained as the de facto leaders in any unit, with conscript NCOs only assisting at the squad level. That meant officers needed to be much higher trained and motivated, but they didn&#39;t think that was a problem. And because their system emphasized followed in-depth orders from higher level commanders, they didn&#39;t need or want an empowered NCO corps, they just needed to be competent enough to take the slack off of the platoon leaders, which meant an extra two months of leadership training for slightly above average trainees (the better ones already having been selected to attend officer academies).</p>\n\n<p>In 2009, the Russian military introduced the New Look reforms where they greatly revamped their manpower and personnel system. Conscription was shortened from two years to one year. Enlisted contract troops replaced most conscripts in positions needing knowledge, motivation, and discipline. &quot;Enlisted professionals&quot; were made into a newly functioning NCO corps that included senior NCO ranks at the company level (first replacing and then augmenting warrant officer positions). However, they still never  decentralized their leadership so officers still have all the responsibilities and duties, like discipline, leadership, training, planning, and can&#39;t/won&#39;t rely on their NCO corps like the West. </p>\n\n<p>Due to recruitment issues, funding shortfalls due to 2014 sanctions, inconsistent training, discipline and corruption problems, the reforms weren&#39;t fully developed before this war started.

While we can't be 100% sure, everything seems to indicate, that Russia's plan was to completely conquer Ukraine/install puppet regime in Kyiv. Was this Putin's endgame all from 2014 (when he didn't use golden opportunity to crush much weaker UA). If  yes, why not conquer UA then and why wait for many years? If no, when do you think was the decision made?\n2. If Ukraine would fall quickly, where would another russian strike be expected? \n3. How would Ukrainan military compare to different NATO countries? AKA, how would they perform in Ukraine's shoes?\n\nFrom my armchair general point of view:\n1. At first, Putin only wanted to use direct military force to take Crimea and expected Ukraine to crumble/Russian-majority regions to join Russia or form \"independent\" republics. This would cause much less backlash than straight up trying to conques UA and maybe would be best scenario in minds of Kremlin elites - southern and eastern parts join Russia, rest becomes broken puppet and buffer state. Another hope was that after Zelensky was elected, he  would try to somehow appease Russia and do as told. When this didn't happen, invasion was just a matter of right momment. Was this the right time? Probably not, but the chances are, that earlier with all the Covid stuff, Russia didn't want to put another strain on its economy.

Reminder - these are just my thoughts based on nothing, but speculations. \n2. Honestly, my guess is Moldova (either incorporating Transdnistria, or whole country) or Georgia. Both of these don't make that much sense, but after a potential quick victory,  Russia would be on a sugar rush, so I wouldn't be really that surprised.\n3. This is next to impossible to properly compare even for actual experts, but in my POV, only the US would perform leagues better.

However, where once the pro and anti Russian factions of Ukraine were once close enough in influence that Russian money could make up the difference, the very invasion of Crimea and Donbas collapsed pro-Russian support in Ukraine, and strengthened the sense of a distinct Ukrainian identity. Putin is dismissive of both Ukrainian identity and the very idea of popular will, so rather than accept that his play on Ukrainian territory had poisoned Ukraine from his influence, he seems to have thought that the Zelensky government was what was in his way and sought to use the military to \"finish the job\".\n\n2) Putin prefers to buy influence.

Russia's military was much weaker than advertised in general, but also one of the key factors was Russia decapitating its own army in the initial push to Kiev.

The reason you can't just substitute a different military is because it is incorrect to think of military strength as linear. Military strength is in how many capabilities you have and a well designed military is one that is as capable as possible in the things you need it to do. UK's military is much bigger and better funded than Ukraine's was at the start of the war, but it would do worse at defending against land invasion, because that's not what the UK's military was designed to do.

I don't think you can look at the Russian armed forces' performance and say that they could conquer any nation quickly. And while there are a lot of problems with the western european militaries, they have a heck of a lot more built capability than Ukraine had at the start of this war. Conquering a country is incredibly difficult. And the Russian military we have seen is one that was hollowed out by corruption and mismanagement, and at a fundamental level one that was not designed for a large-scale land war outside its borders. Ukraine's grit and tenacity is commendable, but let's not pretend it is some world-beating fighting force, it is a country eight years out from realizing it's military was a joke. It's transformation is commendable, and the spirit of fight of the average Ukrainian has been inspirational. But I think the large-scale lesson of this war is not that Ukraine was a secret beast, but that Russia was a paper tiger, and that conquest and subjugation have actually become harder in a modern military environment.\n\nThe conventional wisdom at the beginning of this war was that Ukraine would fall quickly, but most commentators with military background pointed out that the force Russia was using was far too small for the job. So, even if you thought the Russian military was as competent as advertised, and even if you thought the Ukrainian military was tissue, just logistically Russia probably didn't have the capability to conquer a country of the size and population of Ukraine. Well most countries in NATO are more urbanized than Ukraine, and Russia has struggle mightily with urban warfare. \n\nThere are 15 countries in NATO with more military spending than Ukraine, and I don't think I would bet on *this* Russian military to conquer any of them, given similar levels of indirect support from the US and allies. Much less conquer them quickly as you posited.\n\nEDIT: I forgot another thing. This war has exposed Russian incredibly poor air capabilities, both offensive and defensive. Any country with a real air force would absolutely hammer the Russian army. Russia's only advances outside of the initial surprise push have been on the backs of massive artillery barrages, but artillery is not usable if your opponent gets air superiority. Air superiority is central to NATO doctrine so there are actually a lot of NATO countries that have real air forces. The amount of Russian planes downed by s2a, and the paltry performance of Russian air defense against NATO weapons should bely statements of confidence about Russia's ability to do sustained operations against any NATO military.",

                    "body": "The issue isn't that Russia is exceptionally powerful, but rather that NATO militaries - save for the aforementioned four (U.S., T\u00fcrkiye, Poland and Greece) - have remarkably puny, if well-trained, ground forces.\n\nLet's take France, which arguably has the strongest land component among the 26 other NATO member-states. Here's its total Army force structure (only combat units):\n\n\\-Brigade HQs: 2x Armored, 1x Light Armored, 1x Mountain, 1x Airborne, 1x Amphibious\n\n\\-Special Forces: 2x battalions (separate from brigades)  \n\\-Recce: 1x battalion (separate from brigades)  \n\\-Tank: 4x battalions  \n\\-Armored Cavalry: 7x battalions (1x separate from brigades)  \n\\-Armored Infantry: 8x battalions  \n\\-Mechanized Infantry: 5x battalions (1x separate from brigades)  \n\\-Mountain Infantry: 3x battalions  \n\\-Infantry: 3x battalions (separate from brigades)  \n\\-Parachutist: 4x battalions  \n\\-Airborne: 1x battalion (separate from brigades)\n\n\\-SP artillery: 4x battalions  \n\\-Artillery: 2x battalions  \n\\-MRL: 1x battalion (separate from brigades)\n\nThat's 6x brigades, with 29x maneuver and 6x artillery battalions between them, to which must be added a further 9x separate SF/maneuver and 1x MRL battalions. The total number of active personnel serving in the Army amounts to 114,700 men and women.\n\nTo the aforementioned Army forces must be added a small Navy contingent of 2,200 Marines in company-sized units, for a total of 116,900 personnel combined. For comparison's sake, Ukraine's ground forces, pre-mobilization and including the National Guard, had almost twice the active manpower (212,600 personnel).\n\nEquipment-wise, France is especially lacking in indirect fires: its 7x battalions have between them a mere 120x howitzers and 13x MRLs. That's comparable to the artillery/MRL allotment of just 2x Russian maneuver brigades. Again, for comparison's sake Ukraine had 1,194x howitzers and 360x MRLs just prior to the Russian invasion.\n\nLastly, and unlike Ukraine, France has practically no trained reserve: a mere 22,750 personnel, of which \\~9,000 serve in 79x (small) company-sized *Unit\u00e9s d'Intervention de R\u00e9serve* (UIR), which can be attached to combat units during an emergency. The balance of reservists serve in various specialist, non-combat roles.\n\nCompare to Ukraine, which in late 2020 had [228,800 trained reservists](https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/files/whitebook/WB_2019_2020_eng.pdf), either in the \"reinforcement\" (regular) or \"territorial\" (TDF) reserves.\n\nSumming up, and looking just at manpower, we get the following strength returns for each country's land components:\n\n1.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The issue isn&#39;t that Russia is exceptionally powerful, but rather that NATO militaries - save for the aforementioned four (U.S., T\u00fcrkiye, Poland and Greece) - have remarkably puny, if well-trained, ground forces.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take France, which arguably has the strongest land component among the 26 other NATO member-states. Here&#39;s its total Army force structure (only combat units):</p>\n\n<p>-Brigade HQs: 2x Armored, 1x Light Armored, 1x Mountain, 1x Airborne, 1x Amphibious</p>\n\n<p>-Special Forces: 2x battalions (separate from brigades)<br/>\n-Recce: 1x battalion (separate from brigades)<br/>\n-Tank: 4x battalions<br/>\n-Armored Cavalry: 7x battalions (1x separate from brigades)<br/>\n-Armored Infantry: 8x battalions<br/>\n-Mechanized Infantry: 5x battalions (1x separate from brigades)<br/>\n-Mountain Infantry: 3x battalions<br/>\n-Infantry: 3x battalions (separate from brigades)<br/>\n-Parachutist: 4x battalions<br/>\n-Airborne: 1x battalion (separate from brigades)</p>\n\n<p>-SP artillery: 4x battalions<br/>\n-Artillery: 2x battalions<br/>\n-MRL: 1x battalion (separate from brigades)</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s 6x brigades, with 29x maneuver and 6x artillery battalions between them, to which must be added a further 9x separate SF/maneuver and 1x MRL battalions. The total number of active personnel serving in the Army amounts to 114,700 men and women.</p>\n\n<p>To the aforementioned Army forces must be added a small Navy contingent of 2,200 Marines in company-sized units, for a total of 116,900 personnel combined. For comparison&#39;s sake, Ukraine&#39;s ground forces, pre-mobilization and including the National Guard, had almost twice the active manpower (212,600 personnel).</p>\n\n<p>Equipment-wise, France is especially lacking in indirect fires: its 7x battalions have between them a mere 120x howitzers and 13x MRLs. That&#39;s comparable to the artillery/MRL allotment of just 2x Russian maneuver brigades. Again, for comparison&#39;s sake Ukraine had 1,194x howitzers and 360x MRLs just prior to the Russian invasion.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, and unlike Ukraine, France has practically no trained reserve: a mere 22,750 personnel, of which ~9,000 serve in 79x (small) company-sized <em>Unit\u00e9s d&#39;Intervention de R\u00e9serve</em> (UIR), which can be attached to combat units during an emergency. The balance of reservists serve in various specialist, non-combat roles.</p>\n\n<p>Compare to Ukraine, which in late 2020 had <a href=\"https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/files/whitebook/WB_2019_2020_eng.pdf\">228,800 trained reservists</a>, either in the &quot;reinforcement&quot; (regular) or &quot;territorial&quot; (TDF) reserves.</p>\n\n<p>Summing up, and looking just at manpower, we get the following strength returns for each country&#39;s land components:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>France: 116,900 personnel pre-mob / 139,650 post-mob</li>\n<li>Ukraine: 212,600 personnel pre-mob / 441,400 post-mob</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s total personnel potential, post-mobilization, is over three times that of France. Given the scale of casualties Ukraine has suffered so far, had France gone through a similar process its Army would barely exist by now!</p>\n\n<p>***</p>\n\n<p>Unless indicated otherwise, the source for the data is always the <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/publications/the-military-balance\">IISS</a>.</p>\n</div>",

And they began to take the domestic situation into account.      </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That was less than a year before the 2021 spring troop build up</p>\n\n<p>kommersant.ru/doc/5154624</p>\n</div>",

In the previous week there was only 1.  \n>  \n>Every day at the front I walk, run and stand at zero amidst all the forward positions of our company - under mortar, tank and air fire and just gunfire of k@ts@py guns.  \n>  \n>I have broken and bloody legs, I have the will and determination to resist and win, but I do not have the strength, important weapons and the capacity to change the critical situation, when hundreds of people from our battalion have been turned into live targets, which the enemy shoots down almost carelessly.  \n>  \n>So I have every moral right and duty to say what I am saying now.  \n>  \n>Our men fought heroically for over a day without communications, supplies, armoured vehicles, with minimal military support, on subsistence food and enthusiasm. Although we were told it was only for 1 or 2 days at the most.  \n>  \n>At the same time no one ran away, did not abandon their positions, did not fight back.  \n>  \n>But in order to avoid the unlawful - further losses of personnel in this area and among the military personnel of the Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in general - we need concrete measures from the high military and political leadership, namely:  \n>  \n>To stop, as a matter of urgency, giving the weakly armoured infantry units of the Forces their own defence areas, and to use them completely or by separate units only for reinforcement within the defence areas of line brigades and battalions of the AFU.If such a situation has occurred, as in our case, immediately rectify the mistake.  \n>  \n>Put under strict control the provision of communications, water, food, equipment, ammunition and firearms to the units and units that are being withdrawn to the line of contact, to the forward positions.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Posts by a man saying he is a platoon commander in the Ukrainian 128th Territorial Defence brigade, and Yuriy Bututsov, Chief Editor of Censor NET, Website who appears to corroborate his story.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/andriy.denysenko.75\">https://www.facebook.com/andriy.denysenko.75</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Last days two platoons of my unit had 12 soldiers with contusions of varying degrees of severity. In the previous week there was only 1.  </p>\n\n<p>Every day at the front I walk, run and stand at zero amidst all the forward positions of our company - under mortar, tank and air fire and just gunfire of k@ts@py guns.  </p>\n\n<p>I have broken and bloody legs, I have the will and determination to resist and win, but I do not have the strength, important weapons and the capacity to change the critical situation, when hundreds of people from our battalion have been turned into live targets, which the enemy shoots down almost carelessly.  </p>\n\n<p>So I have every moral right and duty to say what I am saying now.  </p>\n\n<p>Our men fought heroically for over a day without communications, supplies, armoured vehicles, with minimal military support, on subsistence food and enthusiasm. Although we were told it was only for 1 or 2 days at the most.  </p>\n\n<p>At the same time no one ran away, did not abandon their positions, did not fight back.  </p>\n\n<p>But in order to avoid the unlawful - further losses of personnel in this area and among the military personnel of the Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in general - we need concrete measures from the high military and political leadership, namely:  </p>\n\n<p>To stop, as a matter of urgency, giving the weakly armoured infantry units of the Forces their own defence areas, and to use them completely or by separate units only for reinforcement within the defence areas of line brigades and battalions of the AFU.If such a situation has occurred, as in our case, immediately rectify the mistake.  </p>\n\n<p>Put under strict control the provision of communications, water, food, equipment, ammunition and firearms to the units and units that are being withdrawn to the line of contact, to the forward positions. And do not allow situations like our unit&#39;s, where we are blind, deaf and toothless, homeless on the plantations, collecting water and food, which have been abandoned by our forerunners.  </p>\n\n<p>It is necessary to uniquely disorganize the combat teams, to preserve the ready systems of military and logistically-provocative interaction. In our case, we need to urgently restore the unity of the 128th brigade, all the battalions, including ours, were disbanded and distributed to different branches, regions, attached to other brigades, and in fact turned out to be unnecessary children and combatants.  </p>\n\n<p>It is only because some paranoid inadequate OPU thought that our brigade of Dnieper formation is &quot;Korban&#39;s private army&quot;, which must be broken with the intransigence of the crusaders, by shoving them into the biggest holes of this war.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure they can sense me. And if not, they will be held accountable for everything.  </p>\n\n<h1></h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/butusov.yuriy\">https://www.facebook.com/butusov.yuriy</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Commander of the 128th platoon of the tro dnipro Andr\u00edc denysenko told a shocking story.
