I [wrote](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1arevz0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_15_2024/kqj7re0/) a few days ago that [QinetiQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinetiq) was a good candidate.  Now we know that at least one of them is the [Banshee80+](https://www.qinetiq.com/en/what-we-do/services-and-products/banshee-jet-80-plus).  [There are other Banshee options](https://www.qinetiq.com/en/what-we-do/services-and-products?qu=&so=AtoZ&do=&re=&se=&ca=F38C8687BC4D4C748D2CD2E0C8511960&yr=&ct=).\n\n*Fitted with twin 40 kg thrust gas turbine engines, the Banshee Jet 80+ has an 80 kg static thrust, attributed to the impressive 200 m/s airspeed achieved when flying straight and level (ISA Standard). Adding an auxiliary fuel tank guarantees the velocity is matched with stamina, generating a typical mixed throttle mission time over 45 minutes.*\n\n*With QinetiQ\u2019s CASPA Avionics onboard, the Banshee Jet 80+ has enhanced stabilisation with the added benefit of digital autopilot. Other features, such as integrated GPS, digital telemetry systems, and parachute ejection recovery, ensure effective navigation through various customer training simulations.*\n\n*Versatile, agile, and equipped with our range of optional payloads, the Banshee Jet 80+ can carry the Rattler Supersonic Target as an ejectable payload, further enhancing the customisation options and ability to meet customer requirements worldwide.*\n\n[Ukraine Utilizes British QinetiQ Banshee Jet 80 UAVs as Long-Range Kamikaze Drones | Defense Express | February 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/ukraine_utilizes_british_qinetiq_banshee_jet_80_uavs_as_long_range_kamikaze_drones-9571.html)\n\n*The intention of London to transfer long-range kamikaze drones was officially announced in May 2023.*\n\n*Furthermore, London announced plans to transfer hundreds of such strike UAVs, and the fuselage bears the number \"35,\" indicating that this may be just the beginning of their deployment.*\n\n*The Russians claim that the drone was neutralized in the area of the Novoazovsky district of the Donetsk region, near the border with Russia, approximately 90 km from the current front line.*\n\n*For the Banshee Jet 80+, such a distance falls well within its capabilities because for this drone in the target version, the operational range is defined at over 100 km. But when it came to the plans for British drones, officials claimed their range to be up to 200 km. Banshee flight time is 45 minutes.*\n\n*But it's about converting the drone, as in the original, the Banshee Jet 80+ is only a target drone for training calculations of air defense and pilots. And it's entirely possible that some characteristics have changed due to the need to carry a combat payload.*\n\n*In particular, the idea of transferring long-range drones to Ukraine began to be implemented as early as the beginning of 2023. And even then, the talk was about hundreds of such drones, which required affordability and mass production, making the choice of converting target drones quite pragmatic.*",

        "body": "The Operational-Strategic Grouping \"Tavria\" of the UAF stated (Ukrainian [source](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2024/02/19/7442550/)) that the intensity and the number of the attacks in the Avdiivka sector have decreased and at the moment the Russians are concentrating on clearing Avdiivka. The attacks in the very last few days mostly concern Lastochkyne (attacked by elements of the 30th and 21st Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Army of the Central MD). Pressure on the flanks, both the north-eastern and the southern ones (barring Pervomaiske), is judged to be reducing. The most interesting thing that was stated, in the context of debates over possible further Russian advances westwards, is that it's considered likely that units that participated in the battle of Avdiivka will be transferred elsewhere. Ukrainian observer Kovalenko had written a few weeks ago that he thought it likely that in the event of the fall of Avdiivka a long operational pause would begin in the area, along with the reconstitution of 1st Corps, with the possibility of the return of the units of the Central MD to the north-eastern front, possibly to Kupyansk.\n\nEstimating the level of combat effectiveness and the offensive capabilities of a unit or formation is never easy - far from it. It's possible, however, that right now the vast majority of the brigades and regiments of 1st Corps committed in Avdiivka as well as the brigades of the 2nd and 41st CAAs of the Central MD have been damaged up to the point of their combat capability being compromised. The formation deployed in the sector that is in my opinion the one better off and that should have retained offensive capabilities is the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD (the bulk of which was transferred to the Avdiivka sector over the last month and a half). The intentions of the Russians are unclear, and it remains to be seen whether they are going to continue to commit resources into the sector, now that their main goal has been fulfilled. The coming days and weeks will help us understand them. The Russians could stop here; they could continue some limited actions to seize entirely the villages of Stepove, Lastochkyne and Sjeverne; or they could carry out a larger offensive action to settle the lines along the Berdychi-Semenivka-Orlivka-Tonenke axis and cross the Durna creek. On the Ukrainian side, the capability to successfully contain further Russian attacks is far from optimal, but the Russians will have to return to advancing in the open field, the area that has proved easier for the Ukrainians to defend. \n\nThe Russians should have some limited reserves in the area: some smaller units of the 1st Corps and the regiments of the Territorial Forces that were less damaged/cannibalized during the offensive; possibly the 57th Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Corps and the 9th Motorized Regiment of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet. But the future scenarios will be dependent on the presence of the Central Military District in the area. As I understand it, after the first two months of actions, the command of the Avdiivka offensive shifted from Rostov-on-Don (Southern MD) to Yekaterimburg (Central MD). On both October 19 and November 10, Putin went to Rostov-on-Don and visited the HQ of the SMD - likely to assign orders and indications regarding the offensive. Instead, the general hailed for the victory in Avdiivka is Mordvichev, commander of the CMD. It's therefore very likely that there has been a change of command since December, in conjunction with the commitment of additional units of the CMD. Reports on the Avdiivka sector from the bulletin of the Russian MoD have lately been reported as coming from \"Centre\" Group of Forces and no longer from \"South\" Group of Forces. Therefore, it's possible that within the jurisdiction of the latter GoF, a hole has been created in the Avdiivka sector (probably from Nevelske to Oleksandropil) that is covered by the former GoF (which also covers the Kreminna sector), with the units of the 1st Corps subordinated to it. Again, the next few weeks will tell us whether this is temporary (only for the time of the seizure of Avdiivka, with the transfer of the CMD to other sectors and return of the jurisdiction to the \"South\" GoF) or somewhat permanent, with the units of the Central MD remaining in the sector, in sight of new offensive actions.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The Operational-Strategic Grouping &quot;Tavria&quot; of the UAF stated (Ukrainian <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2024/02/19/7442550/\">source</a>) that the intensity and the number of the attacks in the Avdiivka sector have decreased and at the moment the Russians are concentrating on clearing Avdiivka. The attacks in the very last few days mostly concern Lastochkyne (attacked by elements of the 30th and 21st Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Army of the Central MD). Pressure on the flanks, both the north-eastern and the southern ones (barring Pervomaiske), is judged to be reducing. The most interesting thing that was stated, in the context of debates over possible further Russian advances westwards, is that it&#39;s considered likely that units that participated in the battle of Avdiivka will be transferred elsewhere. Ukrainian observer Kovalenko had written a few weeks ago that he thought it likely that in the event of the fall of Avdiivka a long operational pause would begin in the area, along with the reconstitution of 1st Corps, with the possibility of the return of the units of the Central MD to the north-eastern front, possibly to Kupyansk.</p>\n\n<p>Estimating the level of combat effectiveness and the offensive capabilities of a unit or formation is never easy - far from it. It&#39;s possible, however, that right now the vast majority of the brigades and regiments of 1st Corps committed in Avdiivka as well as the brigades of the 2nd and 41st CAAs of the Central MD have been damaged up to the point of their combat capability being compromised. The formation deployed in the sector that is in my opinion the one better off and that should have retained offensive capabilities is the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD (the bulk of which was transferred to the Avdiivka sector over the last month and a half). The intentions of the Russians are unclear, and it remains to be seen whether they are going to continue to commit resources into the sector, now that their main goal has been fulfilled. The coming days and weeks will help us understand them. The Russians could stop here; they could continue some limited actions to seize entirely the villages of Stepove, Lastochkyne and Sjeverne; or they could carry out a larger offensive action to settle the lines along the Berdychi-Semenivka-Orlivka-Tonenke axis and cross the Durna creek. On the Ukrainian side, the capability to successfully contain further Russian attacks is far from optimal, but the Russians will have to return to advancing in the open field, the area that has proved easier for the Ukrainians to defend. </p>\n\n<p>The Russians should have some limited reserves in the area: some smaller units of the 1st Corps and the regiments of the Territorial Forces that were less damaged/cannibalized during the offensive; possibly the 57th Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Corps and the 9th Motorized Regiment of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet. But the future scenarios will be dependent on the presence of the Central Military District in the area. As I understand it, after the first two months of actions, the command of the Avdiivka offensive shifted from Rostov-on-Don (Southern MD) to Yekaterimburg (Central MD). On both October 19 and November 10, Putin went to Rostov-on-Don and visited the HQ of the SMD - likely to assign orders and indications regarding the offensive. Instead, the general hailed for the victory in Avdiivka is Mordvichev, commander of the CMD. It&#39;s therefore very likely that there has been a change of command since December, in conjunction with the commitment of additional units of the CMD. Reports on the Avdiivka sector from the bulletin of the Russian MoD have lately been reported as coming from &quot;Centre&quot; Group of Forces and no longer from &quot;South&quot; Group of Forces.

        "body": "While the VKS is having a rough week the USAF is making changes to maintain superiority over both them and China's air force.  This includes changes to the structure of airwings and advancing the use of drones and drone motherships.  All branches seem very keen on increasing autonomy to reduce logistical strain and reduce the need for personnel.  Last year the entire Air Force [missed recruiting goals for the first time since 1999](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/09/14/entire-air-force-to-miss-recruiting-goal-the-first-failure-since-1999/).\n\n[This Is How The Air Force\u2019s New Wing Structure Will Actually Work: Different classes of air wings, some that deploy and some that do not, will change how the USAF fights and from where. | The Warzone | February 2024](https://www.twz.com/news-features/this-is-how-the-air-forces-new-wing-structure-will-actually-work)\n\n*Speaking at the Air Force Association's Warfare Symposium in Colorado this month, the three-star who's supervised the rollout of what the service is calling AFFORGEN (Air Force Force Generation) said service leaders took \"immediate lessons\" from how the new teams functioned when they hit the ground. Leaders detailed next steps for these teams and a broader overhaul to air wing structure shortly after Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall revealed dramatic changes to service structure and force employment aimed at maintaining superiority over China.*\n\n*The expeditionary air base teams, which replaced air expeditionary wings, are designed to deploy from the same stateside base after an extended preparation phase and to fill a wide array of roles, capitalizing on the goal of being flexible and agile to respond to various needs. The idea is to develop small, highly capable units made of airmen who know each other well and have worked together extensively prior to deployment. The concept also supports the Air Force's agile combat employment,(ACE) vision, which sees small units operating from an array of global locations with minimal infrastructure and manning, resourced by an enduring \"hub\" base in the region.*\n\n*The expeditionary air base squadron will be at the heart of each air task force, which will also include a command element and the support structure needed to facilitate the agile combat employment strategy. When the change is complete, service leaders want deploying units to train together deliberately for 12-18 months, with airmen hailing from the same two or three bases.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>While the VKS is having a rough week the USAF is making changes to maintain superiority over both them and China&#39;s air force.  This includes changes to the structure of airwings and advancing the use of drones and drone motherships.  All branches seem very keen on increasing autonomy to reduce logistical strain and reduce the need for personnel.  Last year the entire Air Force <a href=\"https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/09/14/entire-air-force-to-miss-recruiting-goal-the-first-failure-since-1999/\">missed recruiting goals for the first time since 1999</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twz.com/news-features/this-is-how-the-air-forces-new-wing-structure-will-actually-work\">This Is How The Air Force\u2019s New Wing Structure Will Actually Work: Different classes of air wings, some that deploy and some that do not, will change how the USAF fights and from where. | The Warzone | February 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Speaking at the Air Force Association&#39;s Warfare Symposium in Colorado this month, the three-star who&#39;s supervised the rollout of what the service is calling AFFORGEN (Air Force Force Generation) said service leaders took &quot;immediate lessons&quot; from how the new teams functioned when they hit the ground. Leaders detailed next steps for these teams and a broader overhaul to air wing structure shortly after Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall revealed dramatic changes to service structure and force employment aimed at maintaining superiority over China.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The expeditionary air base teams, which replaced air expeditionary wings, are designed to deploy from the same stateside base after an extended preparation phase and to fill a wide array of roles, capitalizing on the goal of being flexible and agile to respond to various needs. The idea is to develop small, highly capable units made of airmen who know each other well and have worked together extensively prior to deployment. The concept also supports the Air Force&#39;s agile combat employment,(ACE) vision, which sees small units operating from an array of global locations with minimal infrastructure and manning, resourced by an enduring &quot;hub&quot; base in the region.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The expeditionary air base squadron will be at the heart of each air task force, which will also include a command element and the support structure needed to facilitate the agile combat employment strategy. When the change is complete, service leaders want deploying units to train together deliberately for 12-18 months, with airmen hailing from the same two or three bases. Within the air task force is a mission layer, the expeditionary air base teams, consisting of 100 to 150 airmen formed around a fighter, bomber or air wing squadron. Added to these are a command element and a sustaining layer.

The first is that you don't need to scramble a jet and put strain on limited air frames. Second I have heard conflicting claims from the Russians themselves whether their AWACS can detect Su-24 takeoffs but if they can then that's less warning time the Russians have to detect a potential launch. The range of the Storm Shadow is also operationally limited by the standoff distance the Su-24 has to launch the cruise missile from and in Ukraine, the standoff distance is not small. I remember early on Justin Bronk or someone similar speculated they might be launching them from up to 80kms behind the front. The launch altitude also makes a big difference. The lower the operational flight ceiling the less the ALCM will travel. The operational range of ATACMS depending on the ones the UAF gets could in reality be much longer than the Storm Shadows because of that difference.  Lastly ATACMS are ballistic missiles. For dynamic targeting and time critical targets like C2 nodes that makes a huge difference. If a General gets 4-6 minutes of warning that cruise missiles are on their way, that's more than enough time for him to move. Good luck doing that with GLBMs. As all things the thing that will matter the most is how many we give them and there you are right.",

I'll find sources and post them (although such sources are usually obviously Russia or obviously Ukraine biased because they're who's interested these days)\n\n> I also wonder how many pilots they have left. \n\nNo clue.\n\n> Can Ukraine do something similar too with F-16's?\n\nSimilar to what? Launching strikes? Or shooting down Russian fighters?\n\n> And will the F16 have SEAD capabilities?\n\nIt will likely have the ability to integrate HARM more closely than the launch platforms than they're using already, but \"SEAD capabilities\" is a broad term for a whole host of not only technology but also **training**. F-16s running SEAD in US service carry additional targeting and jamming equipment that Ukraine probably won't get, but it's important to note that Russia has that kind of kit and still isn't doing a particularly effective job because the crucial part is training for the sorties properly and it looks like they didn't do that much. Even with all the bells and whistles I can't see Ukraine with F-16s doing SEAD much better than Russia does it now.\n\nEDIT: An additional thought; my understanding of SEAD is that the DEAD bit is pretty important, and possibly Russia is at a disadvantage there. I believe that the USAF largely relies on [JSOW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-154_Joint_Standoff_Weapon) to hit SAMs that have been suppressed by HARM. Once upon a time the RAF relied on [Brimstone](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2Fd5DLuoYKTNl9wtSfKLy6VVD4c9RoRaUO-au1H2z3IGc.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Da694ca7aaba921410373679e8a79d070eea60514) to hit SAMs suppressed by ALARM (god that photo...). I'm not really sure what options Russia has to take over that job. To my knowledge they have no direct equivalents of either weapon, and [RUSI](https://static.rusi.org/SR-Russian-Air-War-Ukraine-web-final.pdf) describes them trying to do the job with unguided rockets, yielding predictable results:\n\n> Throughout March, Su-35S and Su-30SM fighters continued to conduct CAPs between 30,000 and 50,000 ft, but generally without entering Ukrainian-controlled airspace. Instead, they acted as a deterrent to Ukrainian attack sorties, but were also tasked to conduct SEAD operations. To this end, their CAPs were used as bait to try to make Ukrainian SAM systems turn on their radars to fire at them. If SA-11s or other SAMs did try to engage them, the Flankers would fire Kh-31P and, later, older Kh-58 ARMs at long ranges to home in on the radar emissions, and then turn away.58 Meanwhile Su-25 singles or pairs flown by experienced crews would fly in at low altitude to try to find and kill the SAM with rockets while it was suppressed. 59 However, there were few Russian pilots capable of low-level destruction of enemy air defences (DEAD) sorties in an Su-25 with unguided rockets, and those that could frequently paid for their bold tactics by being hit with MANPADS from Ukrainian troops. 60 Ukrainian Air Force aviation and air-defence commanders confirmed in multiple interviews that while Ukraine has lost a number of SA-11 and SA-8 SAMs to the many Kh-31P and Kh-58s fired since the invasion, none of the low-level Su-25 DEAD rocket attacks was successful.\n\nIf Ukraine got JSOW too, possibly that's a slight advantage to them for the role...but really given they're unlikely to get the associated equipment like jammers or HTS, or the training to do the job properly and would have to do it in the face of fighters and SAMs that still outclass them, I'd be quite surprised if F-16s pull off anything **systemic** in regards to SEAD.",

This was before Prigozhin. Within the diverse set of speakers between those who focused purely on different forms of government and those who focused on Russia, the answer was the same: dictators, autocrats, authoritarians or totalitarians are in essence hard but brittle. From the outside they appear far more stable than democracies and oftentimes are more stable and long lived but internal stresses and fractures can quickly unravel them. Predicting when those internal fractures will appear to break that brittle picture is what's difficult. You would think it would be major wars or economic hardship but its rarely those things. The actions of the dictator or autocrat also makes a difference. Some people are having a difficult time understanding why Navanly was killed now. The simple truth is that the rationale of a dictator-autocrat is very different from the rationale of someone in the west. Every dictator in history has been paranoid, every dictator has wanted to signal to his rivals that he's not to be messed with and every dictator has wanted to give off an air of invulnerability. They want to signal there are no weak points and society is completely united behind them. When that eventual collapse comes I think we will all be surprised by where and who it will come from and surprised by the speed and direction it takes.",

He mostly sticks to major cities, and while it's heartening to see Russians with the guts to go on camera and tear Putin and the government a new one, there's also no shortage of people who are too afraid to answer even the most innocuous question, and quite a few who just regurgitate state-controlled media talking points. And if this is the kind of stuff you have in Moscow, St. Petersburg, etc., I imagine it's even worse in the countryside, out East, and in other non-metropolitan places. People just don't care or they think there's nothing they can do about it.\n\nRegarding the second point: the state security apparatus is full of Putin's cronies. It doesn't matter if they're True Believer-type loyalists or just using their positions to advance their interests - it's clear that Putin has a strong grip on power, so even if you don't like the way things are going, it's gonna be difficult to find like-minded individuals you can trust for some sort of palace coup-style event. Prigozhin got whacked, but most of the elites and the power players considered him a boor. I imagine most of them are instead looking at Surovikin's fall from grace instead - he's lucky to be alive after his association with Wagner, and I don't think Putin would be as merciful with someone who posed a more direct challenge to his leadership. The oligarchs only care about growing their piles of money. Since they stood by him when the sanctions hit, I don't think they're interested in risking their wealth and power now, especially with all the reports of sanctions-dodging we've been seeing lately.\n\nThen there's the fact that Putin's enemies, both at home and abroad, don't really have a single figure they could unite behind. Whether it's some sort of popular anti-Putin activist type or someone from the elites and established power structure with the cachet to replace him, there's no consensus on who would take over if they get rid of Putin. This is something Putin himself took care of, obviously, and while it might blow up in the state's face when Putin finally croaks, for now, it allows him to hold onto power because everyone else is too paranoid, distrustful, and scared to oppose him. Couple that with the fact that the West is still terrified of going over some red line, let alone advocating or assisting Russians in getting rid of him, and well, that gets us to where we are now.",

Would have to be a very clear, decisive, indisputable, and nationally painful and costly defeat. It's one thing to get behind a war you may not even like that much personally, as long as you're at least winning it. However losing an already (for some) unpopular war is hard to put up with. And there never was a shortage of national pride in Russia. One of the reasons a Russian defeat is so unrealistic (I say: impossible) and Ukraine's \"allies\" so lukewarm behind it, and why Putin appears so confident, in my opinion, is precisely because that would seriously endanger the Russian regime. No one, especially not the US, ever wanted to outright topple the system of Putin. Curtailing yes, containing yes, isolating yes, but not regime change, clearly not. Probably because they don't have much of an idea about what might follow and how, just about all bets are off and uncertainty in world politics is generally the one thing you'd rather go without. More so with a country with that kind of stockpiles. No one (in the West) really cares about the people in Russia, it's just obvious few \\*really\\* care about those in Ukraine even. So what could ever propel those Russians? It would need a huge deal of disappointment, despair and pain, an autocrat is bad but (there) a weakling is seen as much, much worse. But if your local strongman is actually flanked, protected if not feared by foreign leaders, including those who prefer to call themselves his \"enemies\", yet produce little to that effect apart from hot air, he clearly isn't in a weak position. And resistance just feels hopeless, that's why I think at least an utter defeat in Ukraine was needed for getting at anything even in the vicinity of a critical mass. Not least since that could  also be interpreted inside Russia as some kind of signal from abroad: we have your back, hunting season now open, go ahead and finish the job. A good deal may well be listening just to that kind of thing. But that's not at all what we hear or see. The Russian regime has nothing to fear from the West in Ukraine, or elsewhere, other than making it a bit more expensive, in order to buy time and to cowardly pass on the problem to those elected next. The Ukrainians are already bleeding to death for us! Why would some poor Russians have to be the next? Why would they want to?",

The division\u2019s market value even surpassed that of its parent company last year.\n\n\n>...\n\n\n\n>\u00a0\u201cGazprom will never again be the huge cash cow for those in power,\u201d said Milov, the former deputy energy minister. \u201cInstead of making excessive profits, there is a risk that the company will become the recipient of state subsidies.\u201d\n\n\nRussia has literally become a one-trick pony. It used to have gas and military equipment as backups, but now it's only oil.\n\n\nSeveral European countries phased out coal and nuclear for Russian gas - because it was Russian - and happily paid a premium to have a good relationship with Russia.

It's possible that the total number of prisoners who were then recruited may have been higher though, as it was not meant to be a system of universal pardons as in Russia, but also sentence reductions, etc, although it was rather confused, there's not much information on the topic and I don't know if it was just noise (another distinction with the Russian system is that the soldiers received their pardon before their service, so these 363 weren't just those who survived, but this makes the talk about \"sentence reductions rather than pardons for some prisoners\" more confusing, as the pardons were also presented as a legal prerequisite to even allow prisoners to serve at the time).\n\nSince then, there has been no new recruitment of prisoners, in particular because Zaluzhny was deeply against the idea, his argument being that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are extremely well respected and seen as the most trustworthy institution in the country, and they rely on this image, which recruiting prisoners would taint. According to prisoner rights' activists, once Prigozhin started recruiting prisoners and using them the way he did, there was also a fear that any Ukrainian recruitment of prisoners would draw parallels to these practices (among UA society and international supporters), which contributed to the idea being abandoned. But since December, the idea has been reformulated in the context of the updated mobilization law, although it was once more rejected.

There was an episode of the Lawfare Podcast that went over the US decisionmaking chain regarding strikes in Iraq/Afghanistan. Theoretically considering the safeguards in place to prevent civilian casualties re: the burdens imposed by international law. The planning process as described in that different context was basically as you described. Intel comes in, typically from remote operated sensors, regarding the discovery of a target of opportunity. However you get the intel, it feeds into the next highest headquarters unit. Theoretically each HHQ is going to have standing orders based on an operational concept by which to craft a response. Do we strike? Do we pass up? Do we escalate to next HHQ? This continues until someone in responsibility says 'go' or 'no go.' In the US this process was very formalized, and certain people had to sign off to actually conduct the strike. In Ukraine things are surely less rigid and formalized, *but* HHQ orders and the organic composition of units is still going to govern the strike/no strike decision.\n\nOnce the decision is made to strike, then HQ needs to decide what assets they can employ as part of their TOE to hit it. If the target is too far, too hardened, too mobile, whatever, they may again need to escalate to yet another HHQ for an asset. But typically, you have either at the commander level or the staff level (chief of artillery is an important position in Soviet style staff systems) who make the ultimate decision of which weapons systems to employ against the target. And the decision matrix is balancing the value of the target against the cost (in dollars, replacement value, or ammunition levels) of the strike. You need a reasonable chance to destroy the target with as little cost as possible, and that can be a balancing act. Further intelligence will tell you, for example, what kind of defense can be expected or what the civilian picture in the area is. Once the math is weighed, options are chosen, and the strike is green lit everything can spill back down the chain to the attacking asset which does its thing. Then you have further intel work to assess damage and repeat as necessary to achieve the object. This process can happen very fast, minutes in the case of the US. It can also take days or weeks, particularly regarding fixed targets or targets placed on a list (you may not want to strike every target as it appears, but rather go for the knockout blow). \n\nTwo additional complications are inter-unit and inter-service issues and battlefield need. Regarding interservice coordination, this is a HUGE issue. Say you want to hit an ammo dump but you want to use fixedwing support. Youre exiting your command chain to give orders to a totally different service and formation, can be an issue. Moreover, in the old Soviet system airpower was often assigned at the CAA level and so it would be basically impossible for a regimental commander to get air support unless it was predelegated to them. And even then, call in times could be long meaning that in a dynamic situation you may miss a rapidly developing opportunity. Along with this, striking operational or strategic targets often comes with a lot of planning headache. But striking tactical targets is something thats often done with a ton of predelegation. A battalion may be assigned additional 155mm support based on its location, as an example. Rather than run up and down the tree trying to call in suppressive fire during an emergent situation, a regimental or division commander may just say 'its yours, feed the battery coordinates directly.' This is very popular within western militaries, who trust their field commanders to make sound choices. Less so in Soviet style forces. They typically relied on centrally planned fires where even tactical support *could* (not always) look like the more organized and preplanned operational and strategic strikes. In that framework a DivCom and his Chief of Artillery would draft potentially complicated fireplans where the battle was reduced into essentially a set piece attack. Moreover, it was doctrine for Soviet forces to lavish the central thrust with support while also starving unsuccessful axes or forces on the flanks. So in that case, the lead battalion of a division may have most of the artillery park supporting it in a very complicated planned *and* synthetic strike package, supported by operational and strategic attacks planned in nearly the same way, while an entire regiment on the flanks may lack any non-organic support all together. And of course no deviating from this centrally planned fire concept, in the Soviet system the center is always right and will execute the doctrinally correct missions because they have the ISR information required to make the right decisions.",
