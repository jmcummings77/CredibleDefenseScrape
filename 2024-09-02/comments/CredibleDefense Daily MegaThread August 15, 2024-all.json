As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Overall, this would reduce by \u201cclose to, or slightly over 900 export permits required under our export controls from Australia to the US and the UK, with a value of around $5 billion AUD a year,\u201d the second Australian  defense official said.\n\n> Defense exports from the UK to Australia, worth some $30 million AUD per year, could be exported without having to go through the standard permitting procedure.

Keeping in mind the usual caveats that a lot of people probably feel like they can't speak their minds, and that this was filmed in Moscow (so not representative of Russia at large), yeah, it sure does look like there's people desperate, or ignorant, or crazy enough to fight for $2k, let alone twice that. Plus, we don't really know how much of the stuff we talk about here gets to the average Russian. How bad it really is at the front, how people are being forced into units they have no business being in, carrying out suicidal attacks, that sort of thing.\n\nI'm originally from one of those shithole European countries no one ever talks about, so I kind of have some idea of how bad things can get in Eastern Europe, and what a ridiculous sum of money $2-4k sounds like to a young guy fresh out of high school with not much else to do in life. I'd never even consider going to an active warzone for that kind of money, but I can bet quite a few of my friends back in the day would have.

Keeping in mind the usual caveats that a lot of people probably feel like they can&#39;t speak their minds, and that this was filmed in Moscow (so not representative of Russia at large), yeah, it sure does look like there&#39;s people desperate, or ignorant, or crazy enough to fight for $2k, let alone twice that. Plus, we don&#39;t really know how much of the stuff we talk about here gets to the average Russian. How bad it really is at the front, how people are being forced into units they have no business being in, carrying out suicidal attacks, that sort of thing.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m originally from one of those shithole European countries no one ever talks about, so I kind of have some idea of how bad things can get in Eastern Europe, and what a ridiculous sum of money $2-4k sounds like to a young guy fresh out of high school with not much else to do in life. I&#39;d never even consider going to an active warzone for that kind of money, but I can bet quite a few of my friends back in the day would have. I&#39;d bet good money that there&#39;s plenty of people out there who&#39;d take the $4k now than wait to <em>maybe</em> get $6k a few months from now.</p>\n</div>",

Literally the most direct precedent to predict future action imaginable?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Iraq_(2007\u20132011)\n\n>The Bush administration later sought an agreement with the Iraqi government, and in 2008 Bush signed the U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which \"all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory\".[11][12][13] The last U.S. troops left Iraq on 18 December 2011, in accordance with this agreement.[1][11][12]\n\n>In 2014, the advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from Syria to Iraq's western provinces prompted the U.S. to intervene again, alongside other militaries, to combat ISIL. In January 2019, Secretary Pompeo put the number of U.S. troops in Iraq at approximately 5,000.[14] In early 2020 the Iraqi parliament voted to withdraw all remaining troops and the Iraqi Prime Minister told the U.S. to start working on troop withdrawal.[15]\n\nEdit: Wait a minute, the OP article is literally explicitly about the Iraqi government choosing *not* to request a US withdrawal. Is this user calling for state violence to force the US to stay in the country? Or is this just non sequitur emotion posting triggered by a post that just happens to have both Iraq and US in the same paragraph?",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>329 words and not a single mention of the time US forces came to and honored an agreement with the Iraqi government to withdraw from Iraq? Literally the most direct precedent to predict future action imaginable?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Iraq_(2007%E2%80%932011)\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Iraq_(2007\u20132011)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Bush administration later sought an agreement with the Iraqi government, and in 2008 Bush signed the U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which &quot;all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory&quot;.[11][12][13] The last U.S. troops left Iraq on 18 December 2011, in accordance with this agreement.[1][11][12]</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, the advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from Syria to Iraq&#39;s western provinces prompted the U.S. to intervene again, alongside other militaries, to combat ISIL. In January 2019, Secretary Pompeo put the number of U.S. troops in Iraq at approximately 5,000.[14] In early 2020 the Iraqi parliament voted to withdraw all remaining troops and the Iraqi Prime Minister told the U.S. to start working on troop withdrawal.[15]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Edit: Wait a minute, the OP article is literally explicitly about the Iraqi government choosing <em>not</em> to request a US withdrawal. Is this user calling for state violence to force the US to stay in the country? Or is this just non sequitur emotion posting triggered by a post that just happens to have both Iraq and US in the same paragraph?</p>\n</div>",

Where I live I've watched what used to be hugely productive shipyards go bankrupt and the land be turned into condo towers. The causes for this are complex. The Jones Act is often cited and in my opinion is a double edged sword: it has protected the industry, but that very protectionism has contributed to it becoming uncompetitive globally. \n\nSouth Korea and Japan are both shipbuilding powerhouses and it's not because they have a huge advantage in labor costs. It's because the governments have made strategic investments in a smart way. We need to figure out how to do the same.\n\nThe Navy's procurement pipeline has been an absolute disaster for more than 20 years now. Much of the damage was done while Rumsfeld was in office. The US wasted over $50 billion on Zumwalt and LCS. The Ford program has stumbled because he pushed the technology readiness curve too much. But even worse than the money is the time we lost. It takes ages to get these programs moving.\n\nThe admiralty also has a lot of answer for. There's been a number of embarrassing collisions and groundings in recent years. When you dig into these in every instance sleep deprivation due to unrealistic duty schedules is a key factor. If you go on /r/Navy you'll find plenty of first hand accounts that this problem is epidemic. The admiralty is trying to maintain an operational tempo that simply is not sustainable given the current resources in ships and sailors. This is particularly a problem with the pacific fleet and I'm honestly confused about what's motivating the aggressive tempo. Yes we need to show the flag vs China but does that require this? I'll defer to people who know more here.\n\nI don't think there's easy answers here, other than the most obvious no brainer is to get our allies to start building ships for us. South Korea is at the top of the list but there's good military capable shipyards in the EU as well. Politically this is unpalatable, and a reasonable objection is it doesn't stimulate restoration of domestic capabilities. I think a pragmatic approach would be to use it as a gap filler while also making strategic investments.",

There&#39;s been a number of embarrassing collisions and groundings in recent years. When you dig into these in every instance sleep deprivation due to unrealistic duty schedules is a key factor. If you go on <a href=\"/r/Navy\">/r/Navy</a> you&#39;ll find plenty of first hand accounts that this problem is epidemic. The admiralty is trying to maintain an operational tempo that simply is not sustainable given the current resources in ships and sailors. This is particularly a problem with the pacific fleet and I&#39;m honestly confused about what&#39;s motivating the aggressive tempo. Yes we need to show the flag vs China but does that require this? I&#39;ll defer to people who know more here.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s easy answers here, other than the most obvious no brainer is to get our allies to start building ships for us. South Korea is at the top of the list but there&#39;s good military capable shipyards in the EU as well. Politically this is unpalatable, and a reasonable objection is it doesn&#39;t stimulate restoration of domestic capabilities. I think a pragmatic approach would be to use it as a gap filler while also making strategic investments.</p>\n</div>",

A2AD is a meaningless buzzword for a metric fuckton of missiles launched by a huge swathe of diverse air/sea/ground platforms, with nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary about it at all. All those overly hyped ASBMs are only one component and not even the most important one. The system of fires works because it's a system. \n\n> Why does it make sense to put them in Japan?\n\nBecause foreign bases is the second biggest no-no for Taiwan (the first being nukes) and the PLA will start shooting if you try. Formal independence is third, and a distant third at that. \n\n> 1) if China really has a structural problem with its demography and economy, why should the US agitate for a war now. Wait a generation and China will implode. \n\nI completely agree. \"If\" being the operative word here. The US certainly doesn't seem to think so, or at least isn't willing to take the risk of being wrong. China certainly doesn't seem to think so either. Makes you wonder if you should think so. \n\n> 2) the best way to fight the PLAN, is to drag it out and fight it in the middle of the Pacific where its littoral missiles can't fight.\n\nI completely agree. Militarily, that's absolutely correct. But politically, what's all the way out there in the middle of the Pacific that the PLAN wants? Not Taiwan, that's for sure. Neither Korea, or Japan, or the Philippines, and so on. \n\n> There is one point elsewhere but it's that if US allies is worried about China, they need to do things by themselves. China isn't invading them with an army or a flotilla. They are playing chickens with ships and what not. The Chinese recently send a few guys on rubber boatsto poke holes in the some Filipino rubber boats. You don't need a carrier to poke holes back. You need a knife. What US allies need to do is to poke holes with a knife back, not complaining. Vietnam experienced something similar and they ... murdered 30 or so Chinese tourists and expats on the street of the largest city in Vietnam just because.\n\nThey can't do jack shit by themselves. China overmatches everyone else in Asia put together, and quite handily too. Watch those videos of guys on rubber boats and you'll see they always have a bunch of ships in the background keeping a firm hold on escalation dominance. It's like someone holding you at gunpoint, and just slapping you. You sit there and take it, because it sucks but it's better than getting shot. What are you going to do, punch him? Vietnam kicked up a fuss, but they didn't win. To Lam, the new big boss in Vietnam, is part of the hardliner security (and pro-Chinese, relatively speaking) faction. Everything is handled behind closed doors now. \n\nIt may very well be militarily impossible for the US to achieve its political goal of maintaining hegemony in Asia. And if that's the case, then the US has no real choice but to back off as gracefully as possible before it suffers a humiliating military defeat. I just don't think that US leadership will ever so much as entertain that possibility, politically speaking, and would rather go down swinging.

The English were at the forefront of this economic revolution (as evidenced by both Smith and Ricardo's nationalities) and the gold-backed pound sterling emerged in the 19th century as the first true \"international currency\". [Here](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/022/0004/003/article-A007-en.xml) is a brief summary of this phenomenon:\n\n>The pound as an international currency is the older of the two, having emerged as such in the nineteenth century. There were two major reasons for the predominance of the pound as an international currency in the latter part of the nineteenth century. First, and most important, there was the overwhelming predominance of Great Britain in world trade. This, of course, reflected the particular economic strength of Great Britain as the first country to reap the benefits of the industrial revolution. British industrial goods were in demand the world over, while Britain had a great appetite for raw materials and foodstuffs; it has been estimated that in 1860 the British market was absorbing over 30 per cent of the exports of all the other countries in the world. The share fell as other countries, notably Germany and France, reached the point of \u201ctake-off\u201d into industrial growth, but in the 1890\u2019s the percentage was still over 20. The trading in goods was accompanied by a wide range of exports of services, such as shipping and insurance, from Great Britain.\n\n>Intimately connected with these trading activities there was also a large export of British capital to the rest of the world, often with the objective of developing the export potential of Britain\u2019s suppliers of food and raw material. A continuous net export of capital between 1848 and 1913 brought up Britain\u2019s total net overseas assets to the fantastic amount of nearly \u00a34,000 million by 1913.2\n\n>As a result of this great outpouring of sterling for trade and investment around the world, pounds were very widely available, and since many countries had substantial imports from Britain, it was convenient for them to conduct a considerable proportion of their external transactions in sterling. It was also convenient to hold sterling in London as working balances. So, by virtue of Britain\u2019s predominance as a trading country, and the consequent pervasive flow of pounds into every nook and cranny of world commerce, sterling acquired a ubiquitous function as a trading currency.\n\nThe general idea of a mercantilist trading system is hardly exclusive to Europe. I think China was generally mercantilist for much of history. For instance, outflow of silver was one of the Qing dynasty's major issues with British opium trade. Additionally, the Silk Road brought gold and silver (and some other precious metals) into China while exported goods flowed out for centuries.\n\nPut very simply, a mercantilist system wants to maximize exports and minimize imports because this maximizes the inflow of gold (and silver). In my opinion, this was probably the result of ruling regimes wanting to stabilize their domestic monetary systems, but they didn't fully appreciate monetary economics as a science. Thus, you had the Spanish Empire inducing massive inflation by gorging itself on \"New World\" gold. The idea that you could actually bring in *too much* gold into circulation in an economy would be utterly foreign to anyone before the mid-20th century.\n\nHere are a couple more resources on the subject of (European) mercantilism: [1](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft1779n74g&chunk.id=d0e5843&toc.id=d0e5843&brand=ucpress) [2](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/story-of-england/victorian/commerce/)\n\nEdit: I went back and reread the conversation, so I will elaborate on the \"foundational contours\". When I say \"foundational contours\", I'm talking about an international currency, relatively free flow of investment compared to pre-industrial history, and a system of trade that establishes reciprocal trade flows, i.e. does not just seek to maximize exports and hoard gold. Trade has stopped being dominated by \"selling stuff to foreigners to maximize precious metals\" and is now a system of global trade flows, product specialization, and supply chains, enabled by an international currency. Industrialism was a key enabler of this system because the idea of being able to preemptively plan and coordinate production to the extent that you could reliably produce surpluses to send to other countries is infeasible without industrialization.\n\nEdit2: Please feel free to ask more questions if I wasn't clear about something.

That's not the case at all. When you set up a minefield, you need to put men *behind* the minefield to observe it. The purpose of minefields is to disrupt/delay the attackers so that they (specifically, their engineering vehicles reducing your obstacles) can be destroyed by fires.\n\nUnobserved minefields, similar to unobserved artillery fire, is worthless. Because if the enemy doesn't get shot up, they can literally just proof a lane at their leisure and blast through. \n\nIf Ukraine decides to *defend* the ground they seized from Russia, then they'll need to *man* those defenses, they'll need to bring up fires to beat back any attacks, and they'll need to feed more and more troops into those defenses to put up a meaningful defense.\n\nIf Ukraine decides to just abandon that ground and retreat, leaving behind a minefield in their wake but no manpower to observe it, then it won't take Russia all that long to just proof a lane and eventually end up back at the border.\n\nUltimately, creating a salient makes for a good PR piece and restoring morale, but the fundamental problem facing Ukraine is still one of manpower, and that problem still needs to be resolved.",
