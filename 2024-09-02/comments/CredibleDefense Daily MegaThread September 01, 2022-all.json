Europe was already reliant on the US, but refuses to accept its reality. Just look at the abysmal state of the German military, and their strategic reserves, the supposed leader of Europe. Europe has *been* reliant on the US. See: Europe's relationships with China and Russia. Canada does this to a lesser extent just to prove a point too despite it being even more reliant on the US.\n\nDon't act like parts of Germany and France didn't get rich by ignoring American concerns about China and Russia over the past few years. Continually allowing themselves to be entangled more and more together. This is just the roosters coming home to roost. So yes, Americans are nonchalant about it because Europeans have no one to blame but themselves. And the Americans are bailing them out and the sooner they accept it just like in WWII (where the Americans bailed them out yet again), the better off they'll be.

And Finland wasn&#39;t too cheap to pay for the capability.</p>\n\n<p>Assume they still see themselves the same way(no indication they don&#39;t) they&#39;d want a capable and gold plated option befitting their status rather than a downgrade.</p>\n</div>",

Compare with the US, who is mixing F-35s with F-15s and F-16s, and seems to plan to do that indefinitely, as opposed to replacing everything with F-35s.\n\nFrom what I can understand, admittedly I'm not an expert on this, the F-35 has advantages in sensors, stealth and connectivity compared to fourth generation planes, but also substantial drawbacks like an inability to carry large payloads while staying stealthy. So the US plan is to do things like sending out a strike of F-35s and F-15s, where the F-35s take point locating targets and benefiting from the protection of their stealth, while the F-15s loaded with weapons hang back and await direction from the F-35s, which might then even be able to take over guidance of missiles launched from the F-15s.\n\nSo my question is, why are other countries preferring to fly F-35s exclusively? Why not half F-35s and half F-15s or 16s, or Gripens? Sure there's an advantage to only maintaining one type of plane, but the stealth adds a lot of maintenance from my understanding. Wouldn't you save money or end up with a larger air force if you did things the US way, with a mix of 5th gen and 4th gen aircraft?",

        "body": "> **[In fiercely contested Kherson, Ukraine pushes to retake occupied lands](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/01/ukraine-russia-kherson-military-offensive/)**\n\n(Washington Post) -- KHERSON REGION, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine's military has kept Ukrainians and the world guessing about the counteroffensive it claims to have launched in this Russian-occupied territory, but Oleksander Skovorodka already feels a shift.\n\nThe 32-year-old resident of Kamyane, a village surrounded by Russian forces, said the pitch of artillery volleys from both directions has ramped up. He and his neighbors have watched Ukrainian attack helicopters buzz the treetops on their way south. On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian military vehicles plied the dirt lane in the region's northwest corner where he and his wife, Taisia, were driving on their way to buy food.\n\n\"We can hear more fighting, more shelling,\" he said. \"The Russians are just over there.\"\n\nThe lane is one of the routes that lets them avoid areas controlled by the Russian invaders, who now occupy nearly all of this 11,000-square-mile strategically vital region, including its capital, the Black Sea port city of Kherson.\n\nThe lane skirts forests and pastures and leads to a makeshift bridge of gravel and pipes across the Inhulets River, which divides Kherson from Ukrainian-controlled regions to the north and west. In recent days, Kherson residents have used the crossing to flee the fighting, most of them heading to the nearby city of Kryvyi Rih.\n\n\"They cross every day,\" said Oleksander Pokusayev, who lives in the adjacent village of Shestirnya, just inside free Ukraine. He had ridden his Soviet-era Voskhod motorcycle to the Kherson side of the bridge, where he frequently fishes. \"I saw two minibuses full of people earlier today,\" he said.\n\nWith the only official crossing more than 100 miles to the north in Zaporizhzhia \u2014 an abandoned village where access is controlled by opposing armies at either end of a tense no man's land \u2014 evacuees increasingly must find other options. Some are swimming the Inhulets, which is what Pokusayev's sister-in-law did when she fled Russian occupiers in the village of Borozenske.\n\n\"She had to walk through forests for two days. She swam across and Ukrainian soldiers helped her to safety,\" he said. \"Her husband is still in the occupied side.\"\n\nAs he was talking, a Ukrainian patrol came along, stopping to check on the safety of four Washington Post journalists. Because of the offensive, and increasing maneuvers by both sides, the Ukrainian soldiers said the Kherson side of the river was increasingly unsafe.\n\n\"It's very risky here now,\" said one soldier, who asked not to be identified by name or unit. \"The Russians are very close and their weapons are not very precise. Their rockets can go anywhere.\"\n\nKherson was the first strategically important city captured by Russia at the start of the invasion in late February, and the broader Kherson region helps form Russian President Vladimir Putin's coveted \"land bridge\" to Crimea, which Russian invaded and annexed in 2014.\n\nResidents of the area have seen control of villages in Kherson swing back and forth. After Russians seized many of the communities in the early weeks of the invasion, Ukrainian forces pushed across the Inhulets in May, liberating several of them. Ukrainian troops used Pokusayev's village as a base for more than a month of shelling in advance of that push.\n\nNow, residents hope the new offensive will push the Russians out of artillery range. So far, however, the shelling has only worsened.\n\n\"They still hit a lot of houses; they try to hit the church,\" he said, pointing at the gold dome visible across the river. \"My house has been shot twice.\"\n\nFor months, Western intelligence and military analysts have said Ukraine was preparing a major campaign to retake Kherson and the surrounding territory. The regional capital, a gateway between the Dnieper River and the Black Sea, is a major economic hub.\n\nUkraine hopes that retaking the region from the Russians \u2014 who were reportedly planning to stage a referendum in advance of annexing it as part of Russia \u2014 will swing momentum its way in what has become a stalemated war.\n\nIt is unclear whether the operation launched Monday is the predicted large-scale campaign.\n\nInformation from inside Kherson has been scarce. Military officials have barred reporters from accessing front-line areas across the country through at least Monday, a level of restrictions unprecedented in the six months since the start of the Russian onslaught. They have asked Ukrainians to be patient and warned that operational security means information about the campaign will be slow to emerge.\n\n\"It's going to take as long as needed and nobody is going to rush it because people expect something dramatic and exciting,\" said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister who now runs the Center for Defense Strategies, a military think tank in Kyiv. \"They're going to be doing it safely, whatever time it takes,\" Zagorodnyuk said.\n\nUkrainian officials said \"tough battles\" were raging within the region and that their forces had destroyed numerous weapons depots and command posts. At the beginning of the campaign, Ukraine said it demolished major bridges across the Dnieper, cutting Russian supply routes.\n\nRussia has acknowledged that a major campaign is underway but said that it has already had a heavy toll in Ukrainian lives, tanks and equipment. Wounded soldiers have reportedly begun to arrive in Mykolaiv, a coastal city just outside the region's western border.\n\nA Pentagon official on Monday verified an \"uptick\" in fighting inside Kherson, including artillery and rocket attacks, but could not confirm that a major counteroffensive was underway.\n\nThe information vacuum has left Kherson residents in and out of the territory scrambling to find out more. In Kryvyi Rih, where the city government has set up 89 shelters to house more than 35,000 evacuees from Kherson, people who fled the fighting scroll through Telegram channels and chat groups to find out what is happening at home.\n\nSvetlana Kulybanych, 60, and her family are living in a Kryvyi Rih orphanage that has been converted into a shelter. She regularly phones one of the few friends who has remained in their home city of Nova Kakhovka, 25 miles from the city of Kherson.\n\nSomething big is definitely happening, the friend reported Wednesday.\n\n\"She said the Ukrainians are shelling in the city and they have destroyed a lot of depots and places where the Russians stored their equipment,\" Kulybanych said. \"Now the Russians are hiding between the buildings.\"\n\nIf this is Ukraine's big push to expel the Russians, Kulybanych prays that the troops prevail soon. She and her husband, who is recovering from a heart attack he suffered on the day of the invasion, want to go home.\n\n\"We want to start rebuilding while we are still young and strong enough to do it,\" she said.",

Wounded soldiers have reportedly begun to arrive in Mykolaiv, a coastal city just outside the region&#39;s western border.</p>\n\n<p>A Pentagon official on Monday verified an &quot;uptick&quot; in fighting inside Kherson, including artillery and rocket attacks, but could not confirm that a major counteroffensive was underway.</p>\n\n<p>The information vacuum has left Kherson residents in and out of the territory scrambling to find out more. In Kryvyi Rih, where the city government has set up 89 shelters to house more than 35,000 evacuees from Kherson, people who fled the fighting scroll through Telegram channels and chat groups to find out what is happening at home.</p>\n\n<p>Svetlana Kulybanych, 60, and her family are living in a Kryvyi Rih orphanage that has been converted into a shelter. She regularly phones one of the few friends who has remained in their home city of Nova Kakhovka, 25 miles from the city of Kherson.</p>\n\n<p>Something big is definitely happening, the friend reported Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;She said the Ukrainians are shelling in the city and they have destroyed a lot of depots and places where the Russians stored their equipment,&quot; Kulybanych said. &quot;Now the Russians are hiding between the buildings.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If this is Ukraine&#39;s big push to expel the Russians, Kulybanych prays that the troops prevail soon. She and her husband, who is recovering from a heart attack he suffered on the day of the invasion, want to go home.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We want to start rebuilding while we are still young and strong enough to do it,&quot; she said.</p>\n</div>",

So if SK were to complain that NK&#39;s ideology is spreading, that complaint would be legitimate, but the reverse wouldn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>After Japan and Germany the US has utterly failed at nation building time and time again yet here you are once again</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You would have to look at whether there are differences between say Libya and Germany. Those differences produce a different outcome even if the US fundamental intent remained the same.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Without a shred of truth in your paragraphs at this point I&#39;m left wondering what legitimacy even means according to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a country where opposition leaders are murdered and imprisoned. Russia lacks 30m+ toilets, is massively corrupt, has no free press, but can somehow afford thousands of cruise missiles and maintain (on paper) a nuclear arsenal rivaling the US. Make the case for the Russian proposal to humanity.</p>\n</div>",

This doesn't exactly follow the direct cost of energy though.\n\nThe cost of electricity as of July 25th had risen 405% in the previous 12 months. The cost of gas about the same.\n\nIn the 12 months leading up to FEBRUARY, 31 energy companies had gone bankrupt due to the price cap not keeping up with wholesale costs. However the price cap only applies to private residences, not to businesses or schools or hospitals etc.\n\nCurrently schools are talking about closing for part of the week because they can't afford their operating costs. We have daily stories of businesses closing down because they just can't keep going.
