What Now?\n](https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/ukraine-finally-has-f-16s-what-now)\n\nHere are some of the points he made.\n\n-Initially, the primary use of the limited number of F-16 will be for air defence in depth, adding another layer of defence of intercepting Shahed drones, potentially cruise missiles and ISR UAVs. The major challenge will be deconfliction with GBAD. Within ~150km of the border, F-16s will have to fly low in order to not be engaged by Russian AD, putting them in the engagement envelope of the very numerous Ukrainian SHORAD units. While F-16s can be visually distinguished from Soviet era jets, many Russian salvos are fired at night.\n\n-If Ukraine can intercept Kh-101 / Kalibr with Sidewinder then this would be more cost effective and sustainable than using their current ground-based missiles. Using F-16s to take out Shaheds, however, is less sustainable. Taking out Shaheds and other drones with guns is likely too risky due to debris, and collateral damage. He notes that Ukrainian Mig pilots have had to eject due to being struck by debris in such engagements.\n\n-F-16 will be able to deliver more complex weapons than for example JDAM, but the question is what weapons will be supplied. High-end AMRAAM (AIM-120C-8 - D-3) are unlikely to be supplied due to their importance for western air superiority capabilities. This will limit F-16s in A2A engagements, and even with high-end AMRAAMs F-16 will likely not be able to do much about Russian glide bomb attacks without suppressing Russian GBAD. AMRAAM was designed to be fired from aircraft flying high and fast, not from a slow aircraft flying low in dense air.\n\n-Comparing the Iranian missile attack on Israel, where jets were used to shoot down many cruise missiles, the radar in the supplied F-16s is not optimised for picking up low RCS targets against ground clutter. F-16s will be an additive capability, not transformative. F-16s will also require some of Ukraine\u2019s AD to be diverted into protecting the air bases out of which they will operate. Bronk notes that the problem of Russian MALE ISR drones flying seemingly unchecked over Ukraine needs to be solved in order to operate F-16s. He sees this as an area where counter-drones could be an answer.\n\n-As long as Ukraine doesn\u2019t run out of Fencers, F-16s likely won\u2019t be used to launch Storm Shadows / SCALP-EG because Su-24 pilots have already become proficient at launching them, and F-16s will be busy filling other roles. F-16s can in principle carry AGM-84 Harpoon, but by now the Black Sea fleet mostly operates submarines and Harpoons likely won\u2019t be a priority.\n\n-Regarding the Gripen vs F-16, Bronk feels that the F-16 is a likely a political decision, due to the symbolism of operating an American jet. Small numbers of Gripens actually could make a difference, if they are supplied with Meteor, as they could engage Russian glide bombing sorties and force the VKS to change tactics. Meteror would give a far greater effective range against a high-flying fighter target, and a even a limited number of Gripens could potentially pose a serious risk to Russian glide-bomb sorties and fighter CAPs, without having to go too close to the front line. This could be done from far enough away that Russian GBAD would not need to be suppressed, allowing for simpler tactics and easier pilot training.\n\n>The perception that it [F-16] is easier to support, in country, because of that bigger pool [of jets and parts] is likely to be sadly misplaced, because of the fact that the F-16 really isn\u2019t designed to be operated in that kind of context. It was designed for a US air force that had pretty uncontested bases, that were enormous and extremely well maintained, with the ability to have huge amounts of ground support staff and ground-based support equipment, and that\u2019s not the case in Ukraine. Whereas Gripen was designed to be maintained by teams of conscripts with one supervisor, and light vehicles in dispersed air bases, while fighting the Russians under a combined SAM / fighter threat that outnumbered you, while not being in NATO.\n\n-Considering the number of F-16 pilots being trained, the argument that there are not enough Gripens available falls apart, since there are far more jets than there are Ukrainian pilots potentially able to fly them. Long-term Ukraine needs a fighter force of hundreds of jets, but in the short term the goal will be to bolster their air defence, and the only fighter that could conceivably push the glide bombers back is Gripen.\n\nThe remainder of the podcast is spent discussing his new book \u201dThe Air War in Ukraine.\u201d",

Whereas Gripen was designed to be maintained by teams of conscripts with one supervisor, and light vehicles in dispersed air bases, while fighting the Russians under a combined SAM / fighter threat that outnumbered you, while not being in NATO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-Considering the number of F-16 pilots being trained, the argument that there are not enough Gripens available falls apart, since there are far more jets than there are Ukrainian pilots potentially able to fly them. Long-term Ukraine needs a fighter force of hundreds of jets, but in the short term the goal will be to bolster their air defence, and the only fighter that could conceivably push the glide bombers back is Gripen.</p>\n\n<p>The remainder of the podcast is spent discussing his new book \u201dThe Air War in Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

The problem, I think, is not one of morals.\n\nOne of the major issues of Middle Eastern diplomacy right now is that norms-based international conduct tends to break down after a while if it's not mutual. Diplomatic protocol has such a long tradition that it's easy to forget it's not something that just sprang into existence. It was gradually developed by countries that agreed to abide by rules they themselves constructed. There is room for the occasional slip-up but a constant policy of diplomatic disruption eventually breaks down diplomatic engagement.\n\nNational sovereignty hasn't restrained the actions of Iran and its allies in Israel so far. Just last year they have killed more than 70 foreign nationals on Israeli territory, all of them civilians. At this point, it's hard for them to claim, in a regional forum, that they have a problem with foreign nationals being assassinated on a third country's territory, a conduct that they not just clearly condone (and not just on Israeli territory, see e.g. the 2012 Delhi attack) but which they both sponsor and engage in regularly. Their beef is with this particular assassination being conducted on their own territory, a perfectly understandable position in the context of their policy. But claiming a beef with the violation of norms of international conduct that their government does not consider itself bound to, either, is starting to lose credibility.\n\nLeaders outside the Middle East really need to move past the simplistic \"eye for an eye\" understanding of this interaction. If Iran had engaged in international assassinations on foreign territory once or twice, and under what its government saw as extreme duress, the appalling reality is that international protocol would've been able to absorb it.

The problem, I think, is not one of morals.</p>\n\n<p>One of the major issues of Middle Eastern diplomacy right now is that norms-based international conduct tends to break down after a while if it&#39;s not mutual. Diplomatic protocol has such a long tradition that it&#39;s easy to forget it&#39;s not something that just sprang into existence. It was gradually developed by countries that agreed to abide by rules they themselves constructed. There is room for the occasional slip-up but a constant policy of diplomatic disruption eventually breaks down diplomatic engagement.</p>\n\n<p>National sovereignty hasn&#39;t restrained the actions of Iran and its allies in Israel so far. Just last year they have killed more than 70 foreign nationals on Israeli territory, all of them civilians. At this point, it&#39;s hard for them to claim, in a regional forum, that they have a problem with foreign nationals being assassinated on a third country&#39;s territory, a conduct that they not just clearly condone (and not just on Israeli territory, see e.g. the 2012 Delhi attack) but which they both sponsor and engage in regularly. Their beef is with this particular assassination being conducted on their own territory, a perfectly understandable position in the context of their policy. But claiming a beef with the violation of norms of international conduct that their government does not consider itself bound to, either, is starting to lose credibility.</p>\n\n<p>Leaders outside the Middle East really need to move past the simplistic &quot;eye for an eye&quot; understanding of this interaction. If Iran had engaged in international assassinations on foreign territory once or twice, and under what its government saw as extreme duress, the appalling reality is that international protocol would&#39;ve been able to absorb it. But if they do it it all the time and then cite international protocol as a cover against retaliation, they will inevitably come to be seen by their targets as <em>weaponizing</em> international protocol, and their targets will inevitably start treating diplomatic engagement with Iran through a strictly adversarial lens.</p>\n</div>",

For example the concrete barricades that pervade the Israeli border were installed to try and reduce losses sustained from Hezbollah ATGM attacks. Hezbollah has styled their entire force around making sure they can inflict maximum damage in the event of another invasion of lebanon. Because of this their aim will undoubtedly be to bait Israel into a ground invasion to push them back and prevent hezbollah attacks across the border. Even with direct US assistance which is almost assuredly off the table Israeli/western forces are unlikely to decisively defeat Hezbollah forces/ Hezbollah will either draw the conflict out as long as possible or if they are being handily beaten they will disgorge their entire missile stock onto israeli critical infrastructure.\n\nI think its also important to remember that Hezbollah is a vastly different force compared to Hamas. They regularly rotate fighters in syria to train them and because of open borders they can receive modern military supplies directly. Personally i would consider Hezbollah to be a near peer threat to Israeli ground forces considering Israel cannot commit a large grouping. That being said I dont know if Hezbollah could effectively mount an infiltration operation against israeli soil. Its not off the table though. Hama's attack showed the israel was indeed vulnerable to infiltration attacks. I think another risk is the wagner and russian state forces located on the golan heights border.

Along with some behind the scenes computer work to turn raw radar tracks into targeting information for the missiles. I'm going to compare PAAMS against the current AEGIS system, there have been variations of the system over the years.\n\nOn the radar side PAAMS uses two different radar sets for search and track instead of AEGIS's use of SPY6 for both roles. Another thing to note is that there is some variance by country on the exact nature of the tracking radar in PAAMS, but both functionally have a 60 RPM spinning sensor instead of AEGIS having multiple sensors each covering a dedicated arc. The spinning radar will limit the update frequency on a target track, which I suspect will have implications for the accuracy of missiles fired.\n\nAs deployed, PAAMS sits higher on the ship than their AEGIS counterparts, which suggests that they will have a farther radar horizon than AEGIS ships. PAAMS will have some detection range advantage for surface or low flying targets.\n\nTransmission power goes to the AEGIS. By a landslide. The SPY system sits in the megawatt range of transmission capability while the PAAMS is in the kilowatt range. What I could find was 6MW for the SPY 1 (older AEGIS) and 45KW for the SAMPSON (British radar system). This is relevant to getting returns on very distant (like satellites) or stealthy targets.\n\nWeapons systems wise we have a difficult comparison. The AEGIS system is designed to work with a wide range of US Navy missiles, based on the \"Standard Missile\" family. These range from short range missiles meant to be last ditch defense to missiles that can defeat incoming ballistic missiles. By contrast PAAMS uses the general purpose Aster anti-air missile. Circling back to that issue with PAAMS having a spinning radar array, I suspect that it is incapable of guiding missiles with semi-active homing capability (where the missile has a radar reciever but no transmitter, it just watches for the reflection of its parent's radar) due to the intermittent nature of the track.\n\nAnd finally, the computer systems fusing all these different sensor results into one image of the battlefield and tasking a missile to take out targets. These are not widely reported and are classified. So I really don't have anything meaningful to compare. Both are stated to be able to track and engage multiple targets at once.",

            "body": "That's a very broad topic. I'll give highlights; you can Google or look up Wikipedia for details:\n\n* Israel-Hamas war: \n * Hamas relies on unguided rockets (as in, no guidance after the rocket is fired) for attacks on Israel (except the 7 October attack where they swarmed across the border) and otherwise uses mainly small arms (assault rifles and the like), improvised explosive devices (IEDs, basically self-made mines) and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The latter two are its two main kinds of anti-tank weapons.  \n * Israel uses most of its arsenal, including aircraft and drones, tanks and of course small arms. An Israeli specialty is the \"Iron Dome\" system, a missile-based short-range air defense system designed to defeat Hamas' rockets and mortar shells.\n * The Houthis use ballistic missiles to attack shipping in the Red Sea in a campaign said to be in support of Hamas.\n * Hezbollah in Lebanon largely mirrors Hamas weapons and tactics, but has technologically superior equipment thanks to easier supply by their sponsor Iran. \n * Iran itself launched an attack on Israel using a combination of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The key difference between cruise missiles and ballistic missiles is the flight path; the former fly low, while the latter fly in a much higher arc.\n\n* Russia-Ukraine war: This is a conventional war between countries with reasonably modern armies, with Ukraine getting support from the West. As such, they use basically everything in the modern conventional arsenal, ranging from small arms for the infantry and quad-copter drones for reconnaisance to aircraft, submarines and, until Ukraine sank it, a Cold War-era cruiser of 10,000 tons, the _Moskva_. If it's a modern or Cold War-era weapon, chances are someone has fired it in this war. However, there are some highlights that set this war apart from previous wars and that impact how the war is fought:\n * Drones: The role of drones in the war can hardly be overestimated. Russia uses them both for terror-bombing Ukrainian cities (Iranian Shahed drones), to attack Ukrainian tanks and artillery in a way that would earlier have been done by artillery (most notable drone here is the Lancet) and, of course, for reconnaissance (Orlan drones are prominent here). Ukraine used Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones to great (propaganda) effect early in the war in an anti-tank role, though to my knowledge their effectiveness has greatly diminished. Nowadays most anti-tank drones (of both sides) are suicide drones, basically a flying bomb that an operator tries to fly into an identified target and blow it up. They are commonly referred to as \"FPV\" (first-person view), a video game term that means that the operator sees the forward view of the drone. In an anti-infantry role drone-dropped grenades are used, particularly by the Ukrainians. Those are smaller drones, quadcopter-like, that drop hand grenades. Ukraine also uses naval drones to attack Russian ships, whenever possible in the harbor.\n * Artillery: Indispensable in attack and defense. The Ukrainians nowadays largely rely on Western guns, including American, French (Cesar) and German (PHz 2000) self-propelled guns. The shortage of 155mm artillery ammunition is a common topic, and Western weapons donations often include tens of thousands of artillery shells. Both sides also use \"guided\" shells (for Ukraine one example is Excalibur) that increase range and accuracy with GPS and basic steering, but are prone to jamming. A Ukrainian specialty are the (donated) HIMARS missile launchers that are a kind of rocket artillery but vastly outrange conventional \"tube\" artillery and are very precise; Ukraine uses them to attack high-value targets like long-range anti-air missile systems, radars, command posts and the like.\n * Anti-tank guided missiles: Early in the war, Western and homegrown Ukrainian anti-tank missiles like Javelin and Stugna were credited with causing high losses among Russian armored columns. My understanding is that they are less prominent nowadays, likely because the Russians are less reckless than in the early days and use artillery cover, infantry support, smoke and similar combined-arms tactics that expose their tanks less. Another reason may be that the Ukrainians early on more eagerly published videos from such missile strikes for the propaganda value.\n * Air defense is very effective for both sides and has minimized the impact of the otherwise vastly superior Russian air force. The most prominent Ukrainian system is probably Patriot that's used for strategic defense against the terror-bombing and, once, to ambush Russian fighter planes that thought they were safely out of range. The corresponding Russian systems are S-300 and S-400. An oddity is the German-built Gepard AA gun tank used in an anti-drone role to guard high-value targets; it was considered obsolete but seems to do its new job reasonably well. Man-portable AA missiles (MANPADS) are also used by both sides and make tactical air support risky; the main use of air forces is either as a kind of \"flying artillery\" where planes fly as low as possible and lob unguided rockets at distant targets or, for the Russians, air-launched cruise missiles as part of their strategic bombing campaign. The Russians also use some modern fighters with very long-range AA missiles (R-37, NATO codename AA-13 Axehead) to shoot down Ukrainian planes that get too adventurous; Ukraine does not have air-to-air missiles of comparable range.",

A skilled artillery crew can go from radio call to firing shells in 30 seconds, resulting in effect on target within 2 minutes or so depending on range. \n\n155mm artillery has a lethal radius of about 50 m, but spreads shrapnel considerably farther. A barrage will more or less obliterate anyone out in the open over a huge area.\n\nThis is one of the main reasons why massed assaults are not a thing in Ukraine. Using drones as spotters is new, but otherwise this is very well established military tactics.\n\nUkraine is now probably the most mined nation on earth. A staggering number of anti personnel and anti vehicle mines have been placed. Russian doctrine is to make minefields at least 300 meters deep so that rocket propelled line charges can't easily create corridors.\n\nMinefields and artillery are coupled to each other. Imagine trying to clear a minefield while under artillery barrage. It's basically impossible. Again this is why the Ukraine war has become a stationary stalemate where assaults are limited to small units on foot.\n\nHamas has very limited weaponry and uses asymmetric tactics.\n\nThese are the rockets they use to terrorize Israel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qassam_rocket#/media/File:Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Eight_Qassam_Launchers_in_Gaza.jpg\n\nAs you can see they are very crude. They're something that can be built from salvaged pipes and with minimal tools. They generally use \"rocket candy\" as propellant, which is made from sugar mixed with fertilizer as oxidizer.\n\nThese rockets are incredibly inaccurate. It's common for them to not even make it out of Gaza. There's no way to target anything specific with them. They're purely a tool of terror.\n\nAs far as actual fighting goes, Hamas has small arms, rpgs, and not much else. They focus on skirmish/ambush tactics. They do use drones for spotting but also have a long practiced history of simple low tech forward scouts and message couriers. You can't EW a teenager on a bike or such.\n\nOne of the novel tactics used in the Oct 7th attack were troops using paragliders to get over walls/fences. This was a very small number of people but spectacular enough to get a lot of attention. Most likely Hamas does not have anyone else trained in this left alive today.\n\nThe last thing I'd say is key to understand about the Hamas war is that roughly half the population of Gaza is 18 or under. Roughly one third is 14 or under. These are literal children who have never known anything but this conflict. They were born after the last time Hamas allowed elections, which were ended because Hamas was at risk of losing. These young people are bombarded by propaganda of the martyrs constantly. Most of them are personally connected to someone injured or killed in the conflict. This is why Hamas is able to find ample recruits. This is why the IDF needs a \"day 2\" strategy more sophisticated than \"we kill all of Hamas and then it's over\" because it simply won't be over. Do not mistake this for me endorsing Hamas or their atrocities. But we know how human psychology and cause and effect works.",
