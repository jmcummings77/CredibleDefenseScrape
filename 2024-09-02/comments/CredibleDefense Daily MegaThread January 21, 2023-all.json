            "body": "The corruption issue is nuanced. From ~56:00 onwards, the speaker on the left-most, Edward Luttwak, pointed out that the commanders higher on the echelons, the division, military district, theater commands, etc ... have relatively poor opportunities to be particularly corrupted. Some of them, after dinner with Edward Luttwak, we shaking their fist at corruption and so on. The real opportunity for corruption is with the majors and such who controls the contracting and purchasing of supplies.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NXYIcR0Q54M\n\nIf you look at how the Red Army did its business in WWII, there are things and stereotypes about what they do, like long, detailed orders or offensives led and prefaced with massed centralised fires. This, of course, gave the impression that the Red Army is a lock-step, follow-the-orders, type of army but there are some nuances there, too. The Red Army was illiterate for a large part of it and the officer corps were.multiple times decimated. Any good commanders would be hurriedly promoted upwards. The ways they do their business was to economise command talents and allow a smaller number of decent commanders to direct relatively large number of formations and units in centralised plans that can maximise the effectiveness of limited resources. Would they have wanted better subordinates? Of course they would. They knew that, realised that, and in talking about meeting engagement, they emphasised that the meeting engagement is fluid and chaotic and only aggressive, violent actions driven by initiatives would allow one side to prevail. Arguably, the higher command echelons of the RAF, but just below Gerasimov can be highly competent but they have to work with poor stocks. Americans have the reverse problem.\n\n>This war is truly an attritional war and Ukraine need tanks, more artillery pieces and most importantly additional shells.If Ukraine received 300-400 Leopoards it could be enough to hold the Russian counter offension and maybe even try cut the Crimea landbridge at Melitopol.\n\nGeneral Zaluzhny, I believe mentioned that he needs 500 tanks and twice that in IFVs plus artillery and ammo to \"win\".

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The corruption issue is nuanced. From ~56:00 onwards, the speaker on the left-most, Edward Luttwak, pointed out that the commanders higher on the echelons, the division, military district, theater commands, etc ... have relatively poor opportunities to be particularly corrupted. Some of them, after dinner with Edward Luttwak, we shaking their fist at corruption and so on. The real opportunity for corruption is with the majors and such who controls the contracting and purchasing of supplies.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NXYIcR0Q54M\">https://youtu.be/NXYIcR0Q54M</a></p>\n\n<p>If you look at how the Red Army did its business in WWII, there are things and stereotypes about what they do, like long, detailed orders or offensives led and prefaced with massed centralised fires. This, of course, gave the impression that the Red Army is a lock-step, follow-the-orders, type of army but there are some nuances there, too. The Red Army was illiterate for a large part of it and the officer corps were.multiple times decimated. Any good commanders would be hurriedly promoted upwards. The ways they do their business was to economise command talents and allow a smaller number of decent commanders to direct relatively large number of formations and units in centralised plans that can maximise the effectiveness of limited resources. Would they have wanted better subordinates? Of course they would. They knew that, realised that, and in talking about meeting engagement, they emphasised that the meeting engagement is fluid and chaotic and only aggressive, violent actions driven by initiatives would allow one side to prevail. Arguably, the higher command echelons of the RAF, but just below Gerasimov can be highly competent but they have to work with poor stocks. Americans have the reverse problem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This war is truly an attritional war and Ukraine need tanks, more artillery pieces and most importantly additional shells.If Ukraine received 300-400 Leopoards it could be enough to hold the Russian counter offension and maybe even try cut the Crimea landbridge at Melitopol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>General Zaluzhny, I believe mentioned that he needs 500 tanks and twice that in IFVs plus artillery and ammo to &quot;win&quot;.

Not said but also implied is if UAF arty responds they&#39;ll be targeted too, because the entire point of the assault is to trigger the Ukrainians to fire to reveal their positions in depth.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve heard that the Russian counterbattery capability is quite poor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>RUSI reported during the summer it can be 30 minutes for radar but 3-5 minutes using drones to find them.</p>\n</div>",

Popasna was being shelled heavily since the first month of the war, and was being subjected to ground attacks since mid April. The retreat was authorized in early May.

That's going to dramatically help since before September they had major problems considering any contract troop, officer, NCO or junior enlisted, could resign whenever they wanted. \n\nDefensively, they're doing better at the theater level but they were still doing well with that in certain places beforehand, especially the south, and it was the SMD commander taking over the whole theater that caused that. \n\nOffensively, I don't see any indication they've improved. They got a better source for high casualty dismounted attacks, Wagner excons over LDNR, but they can't do mounted ops anymore due to severe risk aversion, they lost too many.

That isn't making a major difference in the mud and urban shit hole of Bakhmut through the winter but it's going to be a problem later on.\n\nRUSI says, due to a lack of officers, they've had to start abolishing battalions as a unit level. Think about what that means for a second and what that'll mean for future ops. Battalions have acted as a bridge between regimental (or modern brigade) command levels and companies since the 17th-18th century for a reason, THEY'RE ESSENTIAL.

            "body": "In terms of language there would be translation done during the initial deal negotiation. Remember that as this deal was hashed out, you develop a base of bilingual tech experts on each platform. So one of the parties, likely the producer, will translate materials for the other party. If Poland wants to get a special radio mounted on the tank, for example, they\u2019d also provide specs & manuals to Korean partners and those they would likely translate into Korean. Idk the exact details of this program, but from what I\u2019ve seen typically you higher on translators early on and try to keep them through the life of the negotiation. \n\nWith regards to training this is very deal dependent. But you\u2019ll see something very similar to what\u2019s happening now with the Leo\u2019s and Chally going to Ukraine. Experts and new crews will do a small batch training program with an eye towards building up cadres. These arnt just teaching crews, but teaching teaching crews, if that makes sense.

The level of training will depend a lot on what Poland wants and how big a change they want to make to their own doctrine. If they plan to use their new K2s as T-72 stand ins, then likely the cadres will just do some small unit training focused on basic skills. If they wanted to consider bigger doctrinal changes in line of what the SK Army does they would probably conduct some bigger unit exercises under Korean supervision. It really depends.

If Poland wants to get a special radio mounted on the tank, for example, they\u2019d also provide specs &amp; manuals to Korean partners and those they would likely translate into Korean.

Within the Bundeswehr leadership, many believe to this day that his reforms were the nail in the military\u2019s coffin. De Maizi\u00e8re reduced the armed forces to a kind of modular kit from which contingents for foreign missions were thrown together from various units.\n\nDivisions, brigades and battalions remained in existence on paper, but they were equipped with only a fraction of the necessary materiel, which in turn became increasingly obsolete due to budgetary constraints. The units that were scheduled for deployment had to scrounge up equipment from the entire Bundeswehr. \"Width before depth\" was the new motto, and the shuffling back and forth of the few tanks and howitzers was celebrated as \"dynamic availability management.\"\n\nHe also rebuilt the lines of responsibility at the Defense Ministry, with disastrous consequences. Previously, there had been two central controlling bodies in the Defense Ministry. The Armed Forces Staff reviewed whether or not the ministry\u2019s guidance served to improve or maintain the readiness of the armed forces. And the Inspector General's Staff served as the key military advisory body to the defense minster.\n\nThe political counterpart was the Planning Staff, which former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt had introduced back in 1969 when he was defense minister. The Planning Staff was designed to steer the huge military apparatus politically and, not unlike a mine-sniffing dog, detect conflicts early and, if possible, defuse them.\n\nDe Maizi\u00e8re abolished both staffs. Since then, the Defense Ministry has effectively been incapable of leadership. Germany is likely the only country in the world with a military that isn\u2019t led by a general staff or a comparable military body.

As a result, there are now at least three centers of power inside the Defense Ministry, each of which is primarily interested in warding off encroachments from the others. A joint management body worthy of the name does not exist.\n\nThat means that when the personnel department, which report's to Lambrecht's State Secretary Margaretha Sudhof, issues a new personnel directive to the Bundeswehr, the news may only reach the inspector general by chance.

It's basically a catch-all term for simulated war and politics, so with a headline like that it's hard to know for sure exactly what to think.\n\nSome examples of war games include:\n\n- Field exercises (real units on a training ground moving around and pretending to fight)\n\n- Field exercises without troops (where officers move on a training ground quizzing each other on what they'd do in certain situations)\n\n- Computer simulations similar to very realistic video games like [Command: Modern Operations](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076160/Command_Modern_Operations/)\n\n- Roleplaying games or Matrix games (where people pretend to be different groups and tell a story about what might happen in that situation, resolving ambiguity with dice or other methods)\n\n- Kriegsspiel (the archetypal 'board war game', halfway between a computer simulation and a roleplaying game)\n\n- Seminars (where a bunch of experts sit down at a table and talk through what might happen using mainly their personal experience and judgment)\n\nAs you can see, different types of war game are suited for very different tasks. A matrix or roleplaying war game about invading Taiwan would be much more likely to be about how other nations might react to such an invasion while a field exercise would be more interested in questions like \"what actually happens when 2,000 marines try to land on a beach and ask the Navy for fire support?\" \n\nThese purposes are broadly grouped into two buckets: training/education (to learn and practice processes that are already pretty well understood) and analytics/research (to explore possible futures we're much less sure about). \n\nSo \"China is war gaming an invasion of Taiwan\" means they've created a system of rules that determines the consequences of actions taken by players in a fictional invasion of Taiwan. It doesn't really tell you what the purpose of the game was, which is as important as the result. For example, the US Navy ran war games about fighting Canada in the 1920s and 30s. What were they exploring? Who knows! As it turns out, apparently nothing useful.\n\nSetting aside training games, even really good simulations tend to have problems predicting the future. It's hard to account for every important variable, so trusting them to predict the future is generally foolish. However, they are pretty decent at *showcasing* possible futures by running with several different iterations of each variable. They're also good at highlighting human decision making. War games help answer questions like \"we expect this to happen when our armor division fights theirs, but what if our tanks are way better or way worse than we expect? what then?\" or \"what are some plausible things nation X might do in reaction to a war between nations A and B?\" \n\nThat's also generally a good marker for trustworthiness. If some people sat down to play a board game of China invading Taiwan once and claim this proves X will happen then that's probably not reliable. But if they run it a bunch of times, tweaking a bunch of variables, and certain patterns emerge then those might be worth paying attention to.",

It was a bet primarily made by Germany that such links would constrain Russia's behaviour by creating interdependence and ensuring they'd have more to lose. The failure of this position was already evident in 2008, and 2014 should have been the end of it; instead, projects like NS2 showed a will to only strengthen it. There were both economic reasons for it to be maintained and strategic ones (a fear that cutting such links would further \"push Russia into China\" and free Putin's hands with regards to Ukraine, Georgia, the Balkans, etc, by taking away the most important non-military means of pressure the West had vis-\u00e0-vis Russia).\n\nIn retrospect, it seems clear that this a failure and that the overall policy of appeasement, the vetos on Ukrainian and Georgian NATO-integration, etc., were all massive mistakes. But looking just at military aid and the perception of US (and the Baltics, Poland) shouldering most of the burden today, does seem to ignore the very real long term economic sacrifices that the EU is doing today to assist Ukraine, as well as the fact that these sacrifices translate to net gains for the US. I don't think many expected to see industrial relocations from Europe to the US anytime soon, for example, and margins on European industry will probably be compressed for the foreseeable future, a situation which comes at a greater economic cost than any military aid provided so far.",

There were both economic reasons for it to be maintained and strategic ones (a fear that cutting such links would further &quot;push Russia into China&quot; and free Putin&#39;s hands with regards to Ukraine, Georgia, the Balkans, etc, by taking away the most important non-military means of pressure the West had vis-\u00e0-vis Russia).</p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, it seems clear that this a failure and that the overall policy of appeasement, the vetos on Ukrainian and Georgian NATO-integration, etc., were all massive mistakes. But looking just at military aid and the perception of US (and the Baltics, Poland) shouldering most of the burden today, does seem to ignore the very real long term economic sacrifices that the EU is doing today to assist Ukraine, as well as the fact that these sacrifices translate to net gains for the US. I don&#39;t think many expected to see industrial relocations from Europe to the US anytime soon, for example, and margins on European industry will probably be compressed for the foreseeable future, a situation which comes at a greater economic cost than any military aid provided so far.</p>\n</div>",

Sure, the latter probably are taking heavy casualties too, some of their attacks will fail and others that are successful will still be costly, but they're not meant to be used cheaply, that's the whole point of how the LDNR first and how the Wagner excons now are being used now, they're purposely taking heavy losses. That translates into being most of the losses that Russia suffers \n\n>Do we expect the Ukrainian forces there to be so woefully inept as to be ground down in defense by barely trained convicts with shitty gear?\n\nNope, they need good troops. But that's the rub. If the UAF go balls to the wall to defend Bakhmut (and they are), they're going to take heavy losses themselves doing it. All of warfare is both a bet and an investment for the future. Was it a good bet? A good investment for the future, specifically towards their long term strategic goals?\n\n>Do we expect this to be at all sustainable on the Russian side, knowing they for a fact are suffering immense losses?\n\nKind of, yes. \n\nThey've been using these tactics since April. Initially the Russians were largely doing mounted probing attacks in IFV and tanks, and those were Russian Ground Force troops. Same thing, recon in force, bait to trigger Ukrainian fires to discover their positions and then hit them with tons of fire to destroy them, to be followed up by assault by more competent VDV or Wagner or Marines.\n\nThere were reports through summer and autumn that LDNR infantry were being used pretty much everywhere, especially doing light infantry probing attacks. That seemed strange since they had limited numbers of them and LDNR 1st and 2nd Army Corps had their own specific sectors of the overall line so why were they serving in random Russian ground force brigade/regiments, the mixing didn't make sense. But then I heard that the Russians were crazily mixing up their units, and heavily low on light infantry manpower (pre-Mobiks). \n\nRunning low on IFV and tanks, can't use Russians as light infantry, LDNR wasn't a good source, that wasn't sustainable. Then Wagner started successfully recruiting from prisons on a one for one swap, recruiting more excons than total LDNR recruited in this war. So that has been solved. \n\nOn top of that, they also have the Mobiks too who can be used if the Wagner excon source dries up. They already used Russians for probing attacks throughout spring summer so it's not like they won't use them in that matter, the only reason they stopped was they were running too low at the time to keep using. So that has been solved. \n\nIn terms of vehicle losses, they're not heavy right now because the a Russians are relying predominantly on dismounted attacks. So no worries about sustaining that.\n\nI'm not sure about artillery, in terms of survival of pieces, ammo, or barrel wear, but in comparison to mid summer when the Russians were attacking on a broad front in the Donbas the same way they're only really doing now in Bakhmut, they'll be using a lot less than mid summer. I won't say the current rate is sustainable because the evidence isn't there, but there also isn't evidence that it isn't sustainable. So we'll have to wait and see.",

There's no guarantee in a war like this that anyone will limit their warfare and actions to a particular theatre.\n\nDo you have any ships (civilian or military) in any of the other oceans of the world?  Russia might chosoe to have one of their subs start sinking your ships elsewhere in the world.  Same goes for airliners.  Do you have military bases and troops and planes all over the world?  Those become legitimate targets.\n\nAnd a lot of the countries nearby ... are all REALLY nearby.\n\nAnd especially for NATO members, if you attack Russia - you're now operating \"outside the bounds of self defence\" - so now you're not protected by NATO's obligations.  That's a huge thing.\n\nMost modern countries are run by people who were taught and can remember what widespread horror a global major war is like.  We're not idiots like Putin and his cronies, who think his people are his to do with whatever he cares to, \"for the greater glory of some imaginary Russian destiny\".\n\nWe actually care about how many of our people AND the opposition's citizens/soldiers will die.  It was a major major thing when studies started coming out showing how many Iraqi citizens had indirectly died as a result of the second gulf war.  We don't do things like that (generally) unless someone sticks a stick into our eye.\n\nAlso - I dont' think we'd try to onion peel an enemy in a real war.  It's almost all or nothing.

There&#39;s no guarantee in a war like this that anyone will limit their warfare and actions to a particular theatre.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any ships (civilian or military) in any of the other oceans of the world?  Russia might chosoe to have one of their subs start sinking your ships elsewhere in the world.  Same goes for airliners.  Do you have military bases and troops and planes all over the world?  Those become legitimate targets.</p>\n\n<p>And a lot of the countries nearby ... are all REALLY nearby.</p>\n\n<p>And especially for NATO members, if you attack Russia - you&#39;re now operating &quot;outside the bounds of self defence&quot; - so now you&#39;re not protected by NATO&#39;s obligations.

            "body": "From the article:\n\n>According to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the refusal from Berlin led to strong reactions in Washington. According to information from American government circles, Defence Minister Austin described the course of his talks in Berlin in an internal report. A meeting with the Minister of the Chancellor's Office, Wolfgang Schmidt, was of particular importance. Since Defence Minister Boris Pistorius had just taken office and the arms export decision is always made in the Chancellery and by Scholz himself, Schmidt is considered a key figure for the German position.\n>\n>Lloyd, who stayed longer than planned in the Chancellery, reportedly got into a heated exchange with Schmidt. The meeting was \"tense\". The American side has been stressing since October that there cannot be a connection between US tank deliveries and the Leopard decision. In addition, the USA supplied arms on a much larger scale than Germany and the other European allies. Among them are new types of mini-bombs that can be used with a longer range and could hit Russian depots in Crimea, for example. There is therefore no absolute parallelism of the deliveries.\n>\n>The German government, however, repeatedly cites as a central argument that German tanks can only be supplied if the USA also delivers its Abrams M1 main battle tank. Lloyd pointed out that the relocation and operation of the Abrams would be too costly and lengthy. Apparently, unlike in the Middle East, the US no longer maintains tank depots.\n\nMore speculation that this has to do with future European tank sales:\n\nhttps://www.nzz.ch/international/kampfpanzer-leopard-2-us-ruestungsinteressen-lassen-scholz-zoegern-ld.1722377\n\n>When the American Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin appeared before the press in Ramstein shortly after Pistorius, he was asked whether Germany was sufficiently engaged as a leading power in Europe. Austin could not help smiling, but then replied that Germany was doing enough and was a \"reliable ally\". He should know exactly why Pistorius spoke of good reasons for and good reasons against tank deliveries. The reasons are of a military nature: without tanks, Ukraine cannot defend itself successfully.\n>\n>...\n>\n>The reasons against have less to do with Ukraine and more to do with Lloyd Austin, the USA and their national interests: The Americans are just waiting for the Europeans to give their Leopard 2s to Ukraine.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>From the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the refusal from Berlin led to strong reactions in Washington. According to information from American government circles, Defence Minister Austin described the course of his talks in Berlin in an internal report. A meeting with the Minister of the Chancellor&#39;s Office, Wolfgang Schmidt, was of particular importance. Since Defence Minister Boris Pistorius had just taken office and the arms export decision is always made in the Chancellery and by Scholz himself, Schmidt is considered a key figure for the German position.</p>\n\n<p>Lloyd, who stayed longer than planned in the Chancellery, reportedly got into a heated exchange with Schmidt. The meeting was &quot;tense&quot;. The American side has been stressing since October that there cannot be a connection between US tank deliveries and the Leopard decision. In addition, the USA supplied arms on a much larger scale than Germany and the other European allies. Among them are new types of mini-bombs that can be used with a longer range and could hit Russian depots in Crimea, for example. There is therefore no absolute parallelism of the deliveries.</p>\n\n<p>The German government, however, repeatedly cites as a central argument that German tanks can only be supplied if the USA also delivers its Abrams M1 main battle tank. Lloyd pointed out that the relocation and operation of the Abrams would be too costly and lengthy. Apparently, unlike in the Middle East, the US no longer maintains tank depots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More speculation that this has to do with future European tank sales:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nzz.ch/international/kampfpanzer-leopard-2-us-ruestungsinteressen-lassen-scholz-zoegern-ld.1722377\">https://www.nzz.ch/international/kampfpanzer-leopard-2-us-ruestungsinteressen-lassen-scholz-zoegern-ld.1722377</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the American Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin appeared before the press in Ramstein shortly after Pistorius, he was asked whether Germany was sufficiently engaged as a leading power in Europe. Austin could not help smiling, but then replied that Germany was doing enough and was a &quot;reliable ally&quot;. He should know exactly why Pistorius spoke of good reasons for and good reasons against tank deliveries. The reasons are of a military nature: without tanks, Ukraine cannot defend itself successfully.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>The reasons against have less to do with Ukraine and more to do with Lloyd Austin, the USA and their national interests: The Americans are just waiting for the Europeans to give their Leopard 2s to Ukraine. Because then they can offer their own tanks as a replacement. The war in Ukraine offers the USA a unique opportunity to gain a foothold in the European defence market with armoured vehicles after helicopters, fighter jets and missiles, and to displace the German competition. They do not want to miss this opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>When Lloyd Austin urges the German government to give permission for the delivery of Leopard 2s to Ukraine, he also has American interests in mind.

To what extent is Germany's intransigence re: tanks just a symptom of a larger problem?\n\nRegarding Leopard tanks, Germany's stated reasons are b.s. in my view.  If Russia manages to eke out even a modest win of some kind, a lot of countries would see how weak the \"international order\" is, leading to nuclear proliferation.  That would drastically increase the odds of a nuclear war.  And nobody is seriously going to interpret the release of Leopards as the second coming of Hitler; most of the other equipment such as artillery comes from other countries. Tanks are just one part of a much larger whole.\n\nSo what's Germany's REAL reason for dragging its feet on Ukraine, and on other security issues like Germany embracing Chinese-made 5G products at a time when many other countries have tried to minimize or eradicate such installations in their countries?  (China is a country that has profited from the international order even as it broke the rules, by forced tech transfers and joint ventures to build up domestic competitors, shutting out entire categories of companies (effectively forcing companies like Google to give up and leave), state-sponsored corporate espionage, etc.)\n\nWhat is it about Germany that it claims the moral high road in not wanting to, say, upgrade Turkish Leopards due to bad press about Turkish attacks against Kurds, and trying to move away from nuclear power, on the one hand... \n\n...and yet on the other, Germany at times seems to prioritize its Russian and Chinese business relationships so much?

To what extent is Germany&#39;s intransigence re: tanks just a symptom of a larger problem?</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Leopard tanks, Germany&#39;s stated reasons are b.s. in my view.  If Russia manages to eke out even a modest win of some kind, a lot of countries would see how weak the &quot;international order&quot; is, leading to nuclear proliferation.  That would drastically increase the odds of a nuclear war.  And nobody is seriously going to interpret the release of Leopards as the second coming of Hitler; most of the other equipment such as artillery comes from other countries. Tanks are just one part of a much larger whole.</p>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s Germany&#39;s REAL reason for dragging its feet on Ukraine, and on other security issues like Germany embracing Chinese-made 5G products at a time when many other countries have tried to minimize or eradicate such installations in their countries?  (China is a country that has profited from the international order even as it broke the rules, by forced tech transfers and joint ventures to build up domestic competitors, shutting out entire categories of companies (effectively forcing companies like Google to give up and leave), state-sponsored corporate espionage, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>What is it about Germany that it claims the moral high road in not wanting to, say, upgrade Turkish Leopards due to bad press about Turkish attacks against Kurds, and trying to move away from nuclear power, on the one hand... </p>\n\n<p>...and yet on the other, Germany at times seems to prioritize its Russian and Chinese business relationships so much?  Is Germany&#39;s political leadership captured by its business lobby or is there something more sinister going on?  I don&#39;t know much about German politics and would like to learn more.</p>\n</div>",

Scholz is being cryptic as always and regurgitating talking points (avoid escalation etc.) that most people know are nonsense, and that he himself is clearly too smart to believe in. His coalition partners are also in favour of sending Leopards, or at least allowing them to be exported.\n\nHowever, while Germany has always been hesitant and slower to send certain stuff, it always ended up sending it anyway. It announced sending MARS II the same day the US announced HIMARS. It announced Marders jointly with the US' Bradleys. It is unlikely that Scholz just lets himself be pushed around by other countries, he's not that weak-willed of a politician. He clearly has an agenda, and given the host of heavy weapons Germany has sent by now, it's unlikely that he really is adamantly against these kind of deliveries. And in this, he actually has been incredibly consistent. He doesn't want to be first, and he wants the US to go first. Not because he is afraid (why would he be, Germany is under NATO protection), but because a large part of the population irrationally seems to be.\n\nSo the problem may be that he needs to manage a relatively divided country. While Germans are overwhelmingly in favour of 'supporting' Ukraine, they are far more divided on sending weapons. The polls over the past couple of weeks were either slightly against sending tanks, or about 50:50, within margins of error. The pendulum has slowly been swinging in favour of sending them, though.\n\nMy best guess is that Scholz is simply communicating with a German audience in mind (not unheard of for the chancellor of Germany), and once he senses a majority support for a certain route of action that he favours (or at least isn't opposed to) himself, he goes along with it. Failing that, he simply piggybacks on the US, because that makes it harder for people in Germany to attack him for exposing Germany to external threats. \n\nAt the same time he is managing a military that has been run down for decades, and only started to very slowly turn around in the last couple of years. His MoD is probably telling him that they really don't have Leopards to spare, and if they are sent, it'll take many years to replace them, given how busy KMW currently is.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the united European/international front in favour of sending tanks doesn't seem nearly as united as many Redditors and some international media outlets pretend it to be. Out of the 22 countries operating Leopards, only two have come forward in favour of sending them. Many others haven't said anything and simply seem to be hiding behind Germany, not wanting to send tanks themselves, but also avoiding all the flak. At least that's what new German minister of defence Pistorius has alluded to after the Ramstein meeting.",

Some Russian telegrams have claimed that the USA advises Ukraine to pull of Bakhmut, as the ratio of attrition is clearly not in their favor and could waste Ukrainian material for their own offensive. This is seems pretty true that Bakhmut is either only a matter of time till it falls, or Ukraine will waste so much manpower holding it, that it wont even be worth the cost. I feel like the ratio is clearly in Russia's favor right now considering the advances that have been made on Soledar, Klischiivka, Kransopoivika, and Blaodatne all within around a 2 week span. A video of a TOS-1A has came out of it firing right on Bahkmut city itself so take of that what you will about the situation there.\n\nNow a retreat from Bakhmut is well to put it bluntly, is currently unacceptable for Zelensky, who has already hyped up the city as the undefeatable wall of Ukraine, and has in the past, refused to retreat even when its obvious, such as in Severdonetsk. If Zelensky allows his own no retreat idealism for Bakhmut to continue for way to long, it could cause a disaster last second retreat, and maybe even a Russian thunder run all the up to the Kramatorsk-Sloviansk line. Considering how much of the Ukrainian military is in Bakhmut area right now, with some Z telegrams claiming up to 1/5th of the entire ground forces of Ukraine in the area, a route due to poor leadership decisions about when to properly leave could have a big ripple effect on this war.\n\nThe North, just recently, like today, a small Russian recon force was spotted in Sumy. This could be a canary in the coalmine situation here, possibly a warning that Russia is about to launch a whole new offensive from the north in either Sumy or Kharkiv regions.

There was no reason why Marder&#39;s and AMX-10&#39;s had to be provided in concert with Bradley&#39;s and Strikers, or why there were no attempts to provide Patriots or other AA systems before the US offered them.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the US ends up providing much greater numbers of weapons the fact that we have to be the first to make any big moves is not helping at all to dissuade people who say the continuation of this war is due to American &quot;meddling&quot; or that we&#39;re throwing our money away on European defense while we have interests elsewhere, no matter how spurious those arguments are. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m wondering if we&#39;ll just bite the bullet and announce Abrams soon because so far the nuance of this tank debate hasn&#39;t really seemed to reach the general public and I&#39;m concerned if this ball keeps being thrown around enough it will, and that could have horrible consequences for the prospect of continued allocation of funds.</p>\n</div>",

That makes it very difficult to engineer past even beyond combat engineering. You basically need construct an undersurface down at least several feet if not to the entire bedrock, to keep the road from warping or sinking. Or build *up* and make a causeway with appropriate drainage away from the surface. \n\nMoreover, building narrow roads is hard enough, you can\u2019t really do that everywhere or under fire. This is a weeks long project. But I would 100% expect that both sides are building new roads behind the line wherever they need them. \n\nLast you have to keep in mind that infantry doesn\u2019t really *need* to work around mud. It sucks, but manageable. Your average dude doesn\u2019t weigh all that much. Unless you hit a quagmire, which IDK is really an issue in the Donbas, you\u2019ll be more or less okay. Tanks and other tracked vehicles don\u2019t do too badly in mud, individually. Tanks are mostly good over unbroken ground especially where a vegetation system has bound the dirt together. Like grass, but a wheat field is different. The issue becomes when you want to pass a company over the same terrain. The issue there really is that armor will both tear and sink the ground. This was something analyzed during the Cold War, and the difference in passability between the first tank and fifth in just one platoon is HUGE. You could in fact destroy a light road with a single platoon. You need a rather well constructed, deep, surface to support a battle tank. Or they\u2019ll just tear it apart.

A large section of a static line can be literally obliterated by one single HIMARS volley.   \nAnd yet you don't see Ukranians bumrushing an obliterated static line.  \nThe reason this isn't done, aside from the cost of 6 M30A1 missiles, is because not long after passing that first static line you reach another, and as you do, artillery is bearing down on you and mechanised troops are responding to the breach.\n\nThe static defenses themselves have relatively little worth. Without proper support, they are practically worthless.   \nStatic defenses have to span for miles upon miles, while a breach occurs in a tiny section, and as the assault reaches the defenders' rear, all those defensive lines are worthless.\n\n>and you are underestimating the availibility of russian hardware. \n\nI am not.   \n\nRussian hardware availability is a statistical matter of fact. We know **roughly** what they have and what they don't have, and we know **roughly** what they're able to produce.\n\nWe know this because we can observe what hardware is entering the front lines.   \nWe know this because Russia is reactivating progressively worse hardware.  \nWe know this because at no point has Russia ever \"held back\"; they are consistent about using their best hardware first.\n\n>you're just wrong\n\nLiterally \"trust me bro\" level of argumentation.

A large section of a static line can be literally obliterated by one single HIMARS volley.<br/>\nAnd yet you don&#39;t see Ukranians bumrushing an obliterated static line.<br/>\nThe reason this isn&#39;t done, aside from the cost of 6 M30A1 missiles, is because not long after passing that first static line you reach another, and as you do, artillery is bearing down on you and mechanised troops are responding to the breach.</p>\n\n<p>The static defenses themselves have relatively little worth. Without proper support, they are practically worthless.<br/>\nStatic defenses have to span for miles upon miles, while a breach occurs in a tiny section, and as the assault reaches the defenders&#39; rear, all those defensive lines are worthless.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>and you are underestimating the availibility of russian hardware. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not.   </p>\n\n<p>Russian hardware availability is a statistical matter of fact.
