        "body": "*Does a protracted conflict favour Russia or Ukraine? Ukraine is counting on its Western allies; Vladimir Putin is counting on them to lose heart*\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine\n\nThe typical\u00a0war is short. Since 1815, the median duration of wars between states has been just over three months, calculates Paul Poast of the University of Chicago. In 2003 America toppled the government of Iraq in just 20 days. The conflict that Armenia and Azerbaijan fought over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020 was over in 44. Yet Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has entered its fifth month, and shows no sign of drawing to a close. \u201cI am afraid that we need to steel ourselves for a long war,\u201d wrote Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s prime minister, in mid-June. Jens Stoltenberg,\u00a0nato\u2019s secretary-general, echoed his warning: \u201cWe must prepare for the fact that it could take years.\u201d\n\nIn the early days of the invasion the West worried that Ukrainian forces would be swiftly overwhelmed by Russia\u2019s superior firepower and resistance would collapse. Now the fears are different: that Ukraine has not adjusted its strategy enough to fight a sustained war of attrition; that it will run out of soldiers and munitions; that months of pummelling will cause its economy to collapse; that the will to fight may ebb as the going gets even tougher. \n\nRussia, too, is subject to many of the same pressures, with the conflict chewing up its young men, sapping its economy and accelerating its descent into dictatorship. A protracted conflict will also test the resolve of Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, as the price of food and energy soars, inflation riles voters and Ukraine\u2019s requests for weapons and cash escalate. A long war, in short, will test both sides in new ways. Whether it favours Russia or Ukraine depends in large part on how the West responds.\n\nStart on the battlefield. Russia\u2019s army is making headway, albeit slowly. Ukrainian forces have been ordered to withdraw from the town of Severodonetsk, putting Russia within spitting distance of controlling all of Luhansk province, one of two that together form the Donbas region. Slovyansk, in the north-east of Donetsk, the other province in Donbas, is also under attack (see map).\n\nUkraine\u2019s forces, outgunned and until recently largely outranged in artillery, have been mauled. The government says they are suffering as many as 200 casualties a day. On June 15th a Ukrainian general said that the army had lost 1,300 armoured vehicles, 400 tanks and 700 artillery systems, far more than previously thought. Many of Ukraine\u2019s most experienced and best-trained units have been destroyed, leaving greener reservists to take their place. On June 19th British defence intelligence said there had been desertions among Ukrainian troops.\n\nYet this does not mean Russia will sweep through Donbas. Its advance has been slow, grinding and costly, enabled only by massive, indiscriminate bombardments. New recruits are getting just a few days of training before being thrown into battle, according to the\u00a0bbc\u2019s Russian service. Morale is low: British intelligence points to \u201carmed stand-offs between officers and their troops\u201d. It has taken more than two months to capture Severodonetsk, and \n\nSlovyansk and next-door Kramatorsk are better fortified.\nRussia still has plenty of munitions and equipment, says **Richard Connolly, an expert on the country\u2019s economy and defence industry.** Russian arms factories are said to be working double or triple shifts, he notes. Russia also has large stockpiles of old tanks to draw on. Over time, shortages will bite, but they are more likely to lead to the deployment of outmoded or poorly maintained weapons than to a total drought, Mr Connolly believes.\n\n**Men, not machines**\n\nManpower is a bigger problem. Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, has refused to call up conscripts and reservists\u00a0en masse. Instead of a general mobilisation, says **Michael Kofman of\u00a0cna, a think-tank,** his army is creating new reserve battalions by signing up new recruits. But finding enough of them is difficult: the government has had to offer lavish pay, of almost three times the median wage. The injured and bereaved have been promised generous settlements, too. The Duma, Russia\u2019s parliament, recently lifted the maximum age to join the army from 40 to 65. The authorities are trying to lure recently retired soldiers back into service.\n\nIn an effort to create battle-ready forces much faster than usual, the newly enlisted are being mashed together with serving officers who have not yet deployed and residual equipment from existing brigades, Mr Kofman notes. \nBut generating new units in this way amounts to \u201cselling off the family silver\u201d, says a Western official. The officers and equipment assigned to them would normally be used to train new soldiers or to relieve battle-worn troops. Russia is, in effect, cannibalising its own forces, Mr Kofman says, which will reduce \u201cthe overall sustainability of the war effort\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s shortage of well-trained troops is one reason its advance in Donbas has been glacial. Ukraine, despite a smaller population, has a larger supply of eager recruits. Training them remains a bottleneck, but that could be overcome with a little help: on June 17th Mr Johnson proposed a scheme whereby Britain would train as many as 10,000 soldiers every 120 days.\n\nUkraine is also receiving ever more sophisticated Western weaponry. To begin with, it sought chiefly short-range, portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to fend off advancing armoured columns and marauding helicopters. More recently, however, America, Britain and others have been supplying modern artillery and rockets, which will be much more useful in any counter-attacks. On June 23rd Ukraine\u2019s defence minister said that American\u00a0himars\u00a0rocket launchers, with\u00a0gps-guided munitions, had begun to arrive.\n\nIndeed, some Ukrainian officials, including Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, argue that if Western help arrives on a sufficient scale, Ukraine may be able to win the war before winter sets in. A military intelligence officer says that Ukraine\u2019s best window for a counter-offensive will come in late October, when its stock of Western arms should be peaking. \u201cWe need the enemy to feel the full force of the weaponry,\u201d he says. There is talk of pushing Russia back to its positions at the start of the war, and then negotiating a peace deal from a position of strength.\n\nBut this optimism glosses over several yawning pitfalls. For one thing, Ukraine\u2019s forces have used most of their munitions and, without the domestic manufacturing capacity to replenish them, are now completely reliant on foreign benefactors. The recent fighting has centred on long, heavy artillery barrages that consume vast amounts of ammunition. Russia, which has huge stocks, is thought to be blasting away so indiscriminately that America\u2019s entire annual production would be enough to keep its guns firing for only two weeks, observes **Alex Vershinin, a retired\u00a0us\u00a0Army officer.** Even though Ukraine has been trying to ration its consumption,\u00a0nato\u00a0countries may struggle to keep it adequately supplied with shells.\n\nWhat is more, Ukraine\u2019s backers have already handed over a big share of their stocks of certain weapons. The 7,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles America has provided, for instance, are thought to amount to about a third of its total inventory. Western armies do not want to let their own supplies run too low; in fact, many of them are hoping to add to them in light of\u00a0Russia\u2019s aggression.\n\nAlthough America and Europe, with vastly larger economies than Russia, could eventually gear up to produce whatever Ukraine needs, their output of shells and missiles will not double overnight. America produces only 2,100 Javelins a year. Mr Vershinin notes that the number of American small-arms plants has shrunk from five during the Vietnam war to one today.\n\nMaintaining all the fancy\u00a0nato\u00a0kit is also hard. America and Germany taught Ukrainian soldiers to use their howitzers in a couple of weeks, but learning how to fix them is another matter. The use of artillery pieces is so intense that many have already broken down and have been sent to Poland for repair. This problem will grow as complex weapons like\u00a0himars\u00a0arrive and Ukraine gradually moves from Soviet hardware to weapons provided by\u00a0nato.\n\nPerhaps most important is how Ukraine deploys its new arsenal. Many of the weapons that it is getting were designed in the cold war to face down precisely the adversary that Ukraine now faces in Donbas: a Soviet-style army using heavy firepower. The worry in some Western countries is that Ukraine will try to match Russia gun for gun, and so blaze through its ammunition at a prodigious rate. \u201cIf you want to use\u00a0himars\u00a0as an area weapon,\u201d warned Ben Wallace, Britain\u2019s defence secretary, on June 29th, \u201cyou\u2019ll be running out of ammunition in 12 hours.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to encourage Ukraine to use rocket launchers and other long-range systems in line with their original purpose of fighting a \u201cdeep battle\u201d: hitting important Russian targets, such as command posts and railway hubs, many kilometres behind the front lines. There is evidence that Ukraine is indeed making a concerted effort to strike deep inside Donbas. Mr Wallace says that five ammunition dumps have recently been blown up, along with a number of Russian headquarters.",

The worry in some Western countries is that Ukraine will try to match Russia gun for gun, and so blaze through its ammunition at a prodigious rate. \u201cIf you want to use\u00a0himars\u00a0as an area weapon,\u201d warned Ben Wallace, Britain\u2019s defence secretary, on June 29th, \u201cyou\u2019ll be running out of ammunition in 12 hours.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The aim is to encourage Ukraine to use rocket launchers and other long-range systems in line with their original purpose of fighting a \u201cdeep battle\u201d: hitting important Russian targets, such as command posts and railway hubs, many kilometres behind the front lines. There is evidence that Ukraine is indeed making a concerted effort to strike deep inside Donbas. Mr Wallace says that five ammunition dumps have recently been blown up, along with a number of Russian headquarters.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "This offers a path, if not to outright victory, then at least to a standoff that imposes severe costs on Russia. Western officials doubt that Ukraine will be able to take back all the land it has lost since the invasion began. After all, the war has shown how much easier it is to defend than attack, and Russian forces are well dug in. But if Ukraine can be kept supplied with arms and ammunition and uses its new firepower judiciously, it could recapture pockets of territory, sow chaos in Russia\u2019s rear and inflict unsustainable losses in terms of men and materiel on a Russian army that is stretched thin along a huge front.\n\nIt is not just weapons that Ukraine will need to pursue such a strategy, however; the government is also desperately short of money. The war has smashed its economy: the central bank and the\u00a0imf\u00a0reckon that output could shrink by more than a third this year\u2014a blow on a par with the Depression in America in the 1930s. More optimistic analyses hold that it is the occupied regions that are most afflicted, and that activity elsewhere has recovered somewhat after a plunge in March, with the current year-on-year contraction amounting to perhaps 15%.\n\nEither way, Ukraine\u2019s public finances have been upended. The government has had to spend lavishly not only on the armed forces, but also to provide humanitarian assistance to the injured, unemployed and displaced\u2014even as it has cut taxes to succour the limping economy. The result is a deficit of about $5bn a month.\n\nUnder the circumstances, investors are naturally reluctant to lend to Ukraine. Tax rises would be counterproductive, given the atrophy of the economy. The government is trying to cut some spending: it recently curbed unemployment benefits, for example. The West has pledged lots of aid, but it is not arriving fast enough to balance the books. So the government has been reduced to printing money. The central bank has been purchasing government bonds since the invasion began, at an ever accelerating pace (see chart). At the same time it is burning through its foreign reserves in an effort to stabilise the hryvnia. Inflation, already 18%, is rising. Should the West allow the government\u2019s finances to spiral out of control or the economy to cease to function, the military outlook would inevitably darken, too.\n\n**Bearing up**\n\nRussia looks in much better economic shape, by contrast. After a brief wobble brought on by fierce Western sanctions, the rouble has recovered. Fears of a bank run have receded. Although Western firms have pulled out as much of the $300bn or so they have invested in local outlets and factories as they can, and many educated Russians have fled the country, most forecasters expect a relatively manageable contraction this year, thanks in part to heavy government spending. Mr Putin frequently insists that the sanctions hurt the West more than they do Russia.\n\nIn fact, sanctions are taking a toll, largely by depriving the economy of crucial imports. Car production is down by more than 80% from its pre-invasion level\u2014a reflection, in part, of the difficulty that manufacturers have obtaining parts from abroad, but also of declining consumer demand. In May dealers sold just 26 Porsches in Russia, 95% fewer than the year before. Output of lifts has fallen by half, pointing to a slump in big construction projects.\n\nThe shortage of critical components is a worry for Russia\u2019s generals, too. \u201cWe have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground, it\u2019s filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators\u201d, **Gina Raimondo, America\u2019s commerce secretary,** told Congress in May. Although some Russian firms do make computer chips, and are trying to boost output, their wares are more expensive and less sophisticated than imported ones.\n\nBut relatively few munitions factories seem to be affected so far, Mr Connolly notes, perhaps because Russian defence firms tend to hoard important parts, a hangover from Soviet central planning. What is more, Western sanctions are not watertight and, thanks to its oil revenues, Russia has plenty of money to spend subverting them. The government has been seeking alternative supply chains for some time. A new paper from\u00a0rusi, a think-tank in Britain, points to \u201cmyriad companies based around the world, including in the Czech Republic, Serbia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, India and China, who will take considerable risks to meet Russian supply requirements\u201d. China has signalled willingness to supply spare parts to Russian aircraft firms.\n\nIndeed, Mr Putin appears confident that time and money are on his side. Even if Russia\u2019s forces fail to advance rapidly, they have succeeded in blockading Ukraine\u2019s ports, contributing to the strangulation of its economy. And although neither the Russian public nor the elite was eager for war, Mr Putin\u2019s ruthless security forces and energetic propagandists have kept dissent to a minimum. It helps that most of the army\u2019s new recruits\u2014and casualties\u2014appear to come from small towns in poorer provinces, meaning that Russia\u2019s big cities have been shielded from the worst effects of the war.\n\nBut the lengths to which Mr Putin has gone to avoid a general mobilisation suggest that he is not confident that Russians are willing to put up with a long and bloody war. By the same token, the economic optimism currently displayed by businessmen and the broader population could also evaporate as the longer-term costs of the war, Western sanctions and emigration start to sink in.\n\nMany in Ukraine fear that Russia may resort to more ruthless tactics if the war drags on too long for Mr Putin\u2019s comfort. It could, for instance, target the power grid and heating facilities as winter approaches\u2014a move that would impose an enormous humanitarian cost on the general population. Ukrainians seem to be steeling themselves for such privations, however. Data from Rating, a polling agency, show that well over half of them now believe the war will last at least six months, up from 10% in a sample taken in early March. Nonetheless, fully 93% of respondents say Ukraine will prevail in the end, with varying degrees of confidence. \u201cUkraine has started to believe in itself,\u201d says Alexei Antipovich, Rating\u2019s boss.\n\nUkrainians remain firmly against the idea of negotiations with Russia, with the mood against compromise shifting decisively following the reporting of Russian atrocities in the second half of March. They fear a repeat of the Minsk accords, the French- and German-brokered peace deals that drew new lines in Ukrainian sand but never satiated Russian appetites. Ukraine does not believe the Kremlin will stop at anything other than complete surrender. \u201cWe either win or we lose,\u201d says Oleh Zhdanov, a former operational officer at Ukraine\u2019s General Staff.\n\nUkraine\u2019s allies may not take such a black-and-white view of things. Indeed, Mr Putin may find them easier to dishearten than Ukrainians. By\u00a0slashing exports of gas\u00a0through the main pipeline from Russia to Germany, he recently signalled that he is willing to take Europe\u2019s economy hostage to advance his war aims). Soaring gas prices and economically crippling shortages over the winter would almost certainly induce some European governments to lean on Ukraine to accept an imperfect truce.\n\nSeveral European countries, most notably Germany, were painfully slow to start giving Ukraine heavy weapons. \nMany are still reluctant to describe their goal in sending arms as helping Ukraine to \u201cwin\u201d the war. There is certainly no unanimity within\u00a0nato\u00a0about how to define victory. The longer the war goes on, and the higher the cost in terms of punishing energy prices and decelerating economies, the more reluctant Ukraine\u2019s allies will become to provide endless weapons and cash. Mr Putin, for one, seems to be counting on the West\u2019s resolve to crumble.\u00a0",

In WW2, senior operational commanders of both the US Army and British Army both refused to try to encircle Germans when they had the chance citing the unnecessary risks, stating afterwards that the missed opportunities weren't problematic because they believed they didn't need to perform encirclements to win, they just needed to keep pushing the Germans back.

To perform a large tactical encirclement to capitalize on a UAF tactical predicament requires combat effective Russian maneuver units (motor rifle and tank) with competent leadership from platoon level to BTG level to be very audacious, motivated, and willing to take risks, while their troops must be competent, aggressive, and trusting in their own chain of command that they will allow themselves to be put in precarious positions, to even include potentially having their own supply lines cut, being subject to intense counterattacks, etc. They also need a very well working communications system, they have to have confidence their radios will work.

To do that requires a bunch of company sized road blocks on the MSRs and ASRs, some other limited battle positions in the spaces in between to hold their flanks as well as spot and interdict enemy off-road vehicles and dismounts trying to escape, roving forces to keep their own supply lines open, and lots and lots of drones to call in artillery on any massed group caught trying to escape. \n\nIt's actually okay during early stages of a tactical encirclements for some routes left \"open\" for enemy troops to try to use to get out, they can still be overwatched by ground observers and drones to have arty called on them.

            "body": "Turkey announced in May that it would have a military operation in Syria, to continue pursuing the 30 kilometer \"safe belt\" controlled by Turkey and Turkish proxies across its border, that it has gradually built in prior interventions. Erdogan has given \"we will begin the operation as soon as the preparations are complete\" updates for a month or two now.\n\nThis is a very complex topic, but I'll write what I have at least some confidence about. [Here's the Wikipedia map of the state of the Syrian civil war as of September 2021.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Syrian_Civil_War_map.svg/1280px-Syrian_Civil_War_map.svg.png) Assad's regime holds the red areas; Turkey and its own rebel proxies hold the green; orange and yellow are Kurdish areas; the rest are miscellaneous rebels, of which a couple are secular and a couple are islamist. You can see the green belt across the Turkish border. Erdogan wants to complete that. It will supposedly \"cover Turkey from terrorists\", and maybe more importantly, allow Turkey to resettle a large number of Syrian refugees back into Syrian territory. It will also be a domestic win, which Erdogan sorely needs as Turkey's immense economic problems have given the opposition an edge in the next year's election.\n\nEssentially, years of grinding from all sides reduced smaller rebel movements, ISIS, and jihadists into irrelevance. The main actors remaining are the Assad government with Russian backing, Kurds that get some Western support, and a different rebel faction that Turkey supports (SNA/\"Syrian Interim Government\"). All of these three hate each other. But the Kurds have built something of a cordial relationship with Assad now; under pressure from many sides, they scaled down their goals to an autonomous status in Syria. Meanwhile, Turkey's games directly challenge both Kurdish territory and Assad's nominal sovereignty. Kurds and Assad have therefore had limited cooperation to counter Turkish operations, including a Russian+regime patrolled no-mans-land between the Turkish belt and Kurdish areas.\n\nHowever, the Turkish military locally overpowers all the others, so when it decides to attack, it will almost certainly win. Especially with the limited goal it has announced. *A priori* I would expect the operation to complete in a couple weeks, like Turkey's prior invasions that had a similar scale (Operation Olive Branch, Operation Peace Spring). But I don't know what sort of a dialogue the Kurds have had with Assad in preparation; if they manage to join forces, it is conceivable they could resist.\n\nGeopolitically, this is yet another case of Turkey using its leverage on both Russia and NATO, to make a local power grab that pisses both off but not enough to break the camel's back. NATO would prefer to have a strong Syrian Kurdistan as a democratic force in the area. Russia would, well, I suppose maximize Assad's power as Syria is its only real ally abroad. Neither Assad nor the Kurds are particularly close with other Middle Eastern states anymore, so I assume the rest of the region will be mostly indifferent. ~~Even Iran only runs its militias in the South of the country, so they aren't impacted by this at all.~~ Actually, after some reading, this isn't accurate, and Iran is *also* pissed off.

It'll be a reverse Mariupol. \n\nDestroying the Kherson bridge and the rail bridge can be very counter productive for the UAF. One, they need it to get across the Dniper in that region for follow up operations to liberate Kherson oblast. Two, its the main supple route not only for the Russians but also the 200,000 of so of the UA people in the city, who require it for food as well as their means of escaping the fighting. Who starves first? The Russian defenders? Or the Ukraine noncombatants who have their food taken by the Russians? Unless they are willing to sacrifice the population they need to keep that supply line open. I hope they don't rely on the Russians doing the UAF a favor and showing an act of mercy by letting the UA residents of Kherson escape westwards through their own lines towards the advancing UAF forces instead of essentially holding them hostages as human shields. The latter is something the Russians will likely have no qualms doing, and as bad as it sounds it's actually the right tactical, operational, and strategic choice: it'll force the UAF to kill their own people while destroying their own city in order to declare the retaking of Kherson as a victory.",

Meeting in Sharm El Sheikh included military officials from Israel, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, the U.A.E. and Bahrain.*\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-held-secret-meeting-with-israeli-arab-military-chiefs-to-counter-iran-air-threat-11656235802\n\nBy Michael R. GordonFollow and David S. CloudFollow June 26, 2022 5:30 am ET\n\nThe U.S. convened a secret meeting of top military officials from Israel and Arab countries in March to explore how they could coordinate against Iran\u2019s growing missile and drone capabilities, according to officials from the U.S. and the region.\n\nThe previously undisclosed talks, which were held at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, marked the first time that such a range of ranking Israeli and Arab officers have met under U.S. military auspices to discuss how to defend against a common threat.\n\nThe meeting brought together the top military officers from Israel, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Jordan and came as Israel and its neighbors are in the early stage of discussing potential military cooperation, the officials said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates and Bahrain also sent officers to the meeting. The U.S. was represented by Gen. Frank McKenzie, then the head of the U.S. Central Command.\n\nFor decades, such military cooperation wasn\u2019t considered possible. U.S. commanders in the Middle East sought to encourage Arab states to coordinate their air defenses without involving Israel, which was seen as an adversary in much of the Arab world.\n\nThe talks were enabled by several changes, including common fears of Iran, improved political ties signaled by the Abraham Accords and the Trump administration\u2019s decision in January 2021 to expand Central Command\u2019s area of coverage to include Israel.\n\nAnother factor driving expanding military cooperation has been Arab countries\u2019 desire for access to Israeli air defense technology and weapons at a time when the U.S. is shifting its military priorities toward countering China and Russia.\n\nDiscussions among the Middle East nations about cooperating on air defense, however, have a long way to go and are still diplomatically sensitive.\n\nIn a statement, Col. Joe Buccino, a Central Command spokesman, didn\u2019t acknowledge the Sharm El Sheikh meeting but said the command \u201cmaintains a firm commitment to increasing regional cooperation and developing integrated air and missile defense architecture to protect our force and our regional partners.\u201d Iran \u201cis the primary destabilizing factor across the Middle East,\u201d he added.\n\nSpokesmen for Israel and Arab countries\u2014except the U.A.E.\u2014declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the meeting. The U.A.E. didn\u2019t comment on the talks, but addressed the issue of cooperation broadly.\n\n\u201cThe U.A.E. is not party to any regional military alliance or cooperation targeting any specific country,\u201d the government there said in a statement. \u201cFurthermore, the U.A.E. is not aware of any formal discussions relating to any such regional military alliance.\u201d\n\nThe Sharm El Sheikh talks followed secret discussions in a lower-level working group among representatives from Middle East nations that discussed hypothetical scenarios about how they could cooperate to detect and defend against air threats. The working group included the Central Command\u2019s then-chief planning officer, Marine Maj. Gen. Scott Benedict.\n\nAt the high-level Sharm El Sheikh talks, the participants reached agreement in principle on procedures for rapid notification when aerial threats are detected, according to people familiar with the talks.\n\nFor now, such notifications would be carried out by phone or computer but not through high-speed digital U.S. military-style sharing of data. Officials also discussed how decisions might be made on which nation\u2019s forces would intercept aerial threats.\n\nAfter pledging to punish Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses as a candidate, President Biden is set to travel to the kingdom to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in July. WSJ\u2019s Shelby Holliday breaks down five issues the leaders are likely to discuss. Photo composite: Adele Morgan\n\nThose understandings, however, weren\u2019t binding, people familiar with the meeting said. The next step is to secure the support of political leaders to codify the notification arrangements and determine the interest of Middle East leaders in broadening the cooperation.\n\nPresident Biden is planning to visit Israel and Saudi Arabia in mid-July. A National Security Council spokeswoman said the White House supported \u201cbroadening and deepening Arab-Israeli ties,\u201d but provided no details.\n\nThe U.S. has hoped to build an integrated air defense shield in the Middle East for decades, one that would link radars, satellites and other sensors among countries in the region.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome aerial-defense system can detect and shoot rockets, missiles and other aerial threats, including drones, launched from Iran and other countries.\nPHOTO: ABEDIN TAHERKENAREH/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nEfforts to foster such cooperation on the part of Arab Gulf nations have long been hampered by their reluctance to share sensitive data that could reveal their own vulnerabilities and by fears that Saudi Arabia would dominate such a partnership.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. plays a central role in tracking aerial threats across the region from the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where its air war command center for the Middle East is located. Liaison officers from the Arab countries are assigned to the facility.\n\nAs the threat from Iran has grown, however, there has been a growing awareness in the region of the importance of wider collaboration to counter Tehran\u2019s arsenal of drones, and ballistic and cruise missiles. Cooperating with Israel in this area is also seen as less sensitive than more far-reaching steps such as joint military exercises or joint troop maneuvers.\n\n\u201cYears of continuous attacks with rockets and UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] by Iran and its proxies have, in the post-Abraham Accords era, helped push together both Israel and a number of its neighbors,\u201d said Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\n\u201cIn this game, seconds and inches matter; getting earlier detection and warning, and then establishing a firm track, can be tremendously useful for a defender\u2019s ability to engage, identify, and intercept an incoming threat,\u201d Mr. Karako added.\n\nFor Middle East states, Iran isn\u2019t the only potential danger. Sunni militant groups have also been developing the use of drones to carry out attacks.\n\nJordan and Egypt, whose diplomatic relations with Israel long preceded the Abraham Accords, already cooperate on air defense with Israel. Broadening that cooperation faces considerable political challenges.\n\nSaudi Arabia, which hasn\u2019t established diplomatic relations with Israel, is unlikely to publicly embrace an air defense alliance that includes Israel until after the two countries formalize ties, officials from two Arab countries said.\n\nStill, the Sharm El Sheikh meeting brought together Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, with Gen. Fayyadh bin Hamed Al Ruwaili, the chief of staff of the Saudi armed forces.\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is in the process of acquiring Terminal High Altitude Area Defense batteries, a U.S. antimissile system known as THAAD, according to a U.S. official.\nPHOTO: HANDOUT/REUTERS\nLt. Gen. Salem Bin Hamad Al-Nabit, who leads Qatar\u2019s armed forces also participated, as did top commanders from Jordan and Egypt. Bahrain, whose military chief rarely travels, and the U.A.E., sent less-senior officers. Kuwait and Oman didn\u2019t join the talks.\n\nMany of the building blocks for a potential regional air defense system are in place. Saudi Arabia has bought as many as 22 U.S. Patriot antimissile batteries, according to a U.S. official, and is in the process of acquiring Terminal High Altitude Area Defense batteries, another U.S. antimissile system known as THAAD.\n\nThe U.A.E. already has a THAAD system, which it says was used to shoot down a missile fired at Abu Dhabi from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in January.\n\nIsrael has the Iron Dome system and other advanced aerial-defense systems for detecting and shooting down rockets, missiles and other threats, including short-range rockets fired by Palestinian militants from Gaza and drones launched from Iran and other countries.\n\n\u201cThe task in the theater is really how do you knit those together so you create more than the simple sum of the component parts,\u201d Gen. McKenzie said at a Pentagon press conference in March. \u201cSo everybody sees the same thing, everybody gets early warning, everybody can be prepared to react very quickly to a potential Iranian attack.\u201d\n\nGen. McKenzie, who handed off command of U.S. forces in the region to Gen. Erik Kurilla in April before retiring from the military, didn\u2019t mention the Egypt meeting at the press conference.\n\nIn a briefing last week for Israeli lawmakers, Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Benny Gantz described the emerging arrangement as the \u201cMiddle East Air Defense Alliance,\u201d though some people informed about the talks said they hadn\u2019t heard that term used previously and it appeared to overstate how far the effort has progressed.\n\nMr. Gantz also said the air defense initiative had already enabled \u201cthe successful interception of Iranian attempts to attack Israel and other countries\u201d in the region.\u201d Israeli officials declined to provide details about such intercepts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress. It\u2019s a mechanism that\u2019s being built,\u201d said a senior Israeli official, who declined to discuss the Sharm El Sheikh talks. \u201cThere are definitely partners who see it as too sensitive to talk about.\u201d\n\nSummer Said contributed to this article.",

The reason it doesn't exploit them is because it is bottlenecked by workforce, technology, infrastructure, and corruption.\n\n2) The juicy bits in Eastern Ukraine that Russia hadn't occupied in 2014 are Kharkiv (general industry), Dnipro (same), and Kryvyi Rih (ginormous iron mine & plants). The only really valuable industrial city Russia has taken was Mariupol...\n\n3) ...where they destroyed all the industry by indiscriminate shelling. If you destroy the industry, you have to build it again. And at that point you could just build it in your own cities instead.\n\n4) Donbass has terrible demographics (significantly worse than Ukrainian average) and its economic growth has lagged Western Ukraine for 10 years. It isn't anywhere near as productive of a region as it was in 2014, and its extremely top-heavy population pyramid means that it's likely a net fiscal drain for a country any wealthier than Ukraine.\n\n5) Most of the original population in the newly occupied areas is no longer there; they fled the war and/or occupation. In ethnically/nationally charged wars of conquest (see: all of WW2, Nagorno-Karabakh wars, Turkey's invasions of Cyprus and Syrian Kurdistan, etc) the displaced population practically never returns. Those few that were not displaced seem to be disproportionately elderly. So the territory Russia has taken will not have much useful population. It can be (slowly) repopulated with settlers from Russia, sure, but what's the use? Russia's population is declining and those people could be just as productive elsewhere. As said, Russia has enormous untapped resources in its existing territory they could go make use of.\n\n6) Some sort of a Ukrainian resistance movement will exist. Ethnic resistance is extremely hard to stamp out; it is an invisible enemy you can't kill. Hard to say how significant it will be, given that displacement and mass deportations have taken place, but it will definitely burden the authorities for a long time. For example, Spain is 600+ years into the occupation but still encounters violent Basque resistance from time to time.\n\n7) Smaller point, but supply chains are not static things. Just because 70% of Ukraine's Black Sea exports used to go through Mariupol/Berdyansk/Kherson, doesn't mean it will always be the case. Compared to paying Russian tolls or risking coercion that way, it may literally be cheaper to just build new railways through Poland to the NATO lake.\n\nSo all in all, Donbass will be full of broken down ghost towns that may cost hundreds of billions to repair, and what little remains of the population is too old to help with that. I can't see how it would not be a net financial drain for at least decades. Some of this also applies to Ukraine if it gets it back, by the way.",

Also, Russia has insane amounts of  ammo, while Ukraine is running out of ammo, with no possibility to produce their own. So they fully depend on the West to supply them with weapons and ammo. It is expected that around October many of the Western supplied weapons might come into play due to completed training. By then Ukraine probably will have lost some more territory beyond the 20% they have thus far lost. It does not seem very likely that they can regain much of that territory, On the other hand Russia seems to have too few soldiers to be able to effectively keep advancing without some kind of mobilization initiative (or maybe getting Belarus to join the war). So if i had to predict, I think there is a high chance that Russia  will ultimately succeed in fully capturing the DOnbas. After that, they may try to capture Odessa, which i think has somewhat lower chances of succeeding.

The moment China starts supporting Russia in material and technology, resulting in the West sanctioning China, which would cause China to retaliate, the resulting economic shock and even further division in the world would cause even more extreme ripple effects in democratic countries that are notoriously reliant on imports from China.\n\nThe current economic situation across the world, exacerbated by the war and sanctions, is being touted by Biden as \"Putin's tax\", and I believe we all know why he is using those exact words. This is a clear indication of how reliant western governments are on public opinion. And while some people do agree with that wording, there is zero indication that anyone would want to see an economic meltdown from the supply shock the moment China is sanctioned and retaliates. \n\nWe are seeing the ripples of Russia's still existing power, especially in Europe but also other markets. China's retaliation would arguably be of an even greater impact (although in different places), and any sanctions that would result in a major economic shock, a very long-term one at that, would not be so easily justified for western people. Media can keep airing Russian bombings of Ukrainian cities as a justification for sanctioning China, but the common folk will almost definitely be asking themselves \"what has China to do with that and was this mayhem worth it? two sovereign countries are trading with one another.\" Politicians would obviously scramble to explain and justify (rightly) implemented sanctions, but I don't think many people would support those sanctions all the same, unless they'd see Chinese boots in action in Ukraine.\n\nSuch at first possibly small but later on becoming gargantuan sanctions would cause even deeper, possibly irreparable cracks in an already eroding world order. Replacing Chinese imports would prove very difficult and the Chinese retaliation fallout would almost definitely be a black swan event across global markets. India would most likely be able to come out as a major winner, and so would Africa, parts of which is however already deep in China's and Russia's influence. \n\nRegardless, it would be suicidal for many governments if they were to implement sanctions against China, even now plenty have officially refused to sanction Russia in any way shape or form. Even fewer neutral countries would join in anti-Chinese sanctions.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I am curious if I am overlooking something, but this is currently my neutral observation, I just think that we still have time before these things happen, I believe China is waiting for Russia to weaken even further economy-wise, and only then they swoop in and buy out things for a major, major sale.",

A chronicle of the fighting from June 22 to July 2.\n\nThe front near Ugledar has actually been up since March, so one might get the impression that there are no clashes there. This is not the case: the situation in the area is simply poorly covered by the media due to serious communication problems in the region.\n\nThere are constant artillery duels along the line of contact, and the AFU has even attempted an offensive. One of these occurred late last month.\n\nBackground\n\nSince spring, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have attempted to periodically attack the positions of the Russian Armed Forces and the DNR NM on the line Pavlovka - Nikolskoye - Vladimirovka. The Ukrainian army had no significant successes: even with numerical superiority, only a few villages, such as Novomayorske village southwest of Ugledar, were taken during the entire period.\n\nThe settlements along the line of contact had become an area of humanitarian disaster, with some residents unable to evacuate in an organized manner due to constant shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nThe course of fighting\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f By the end of June, the Ukrainian command was able to concentrate up to several incomplete battalions in a small area and go on the offensive. On the evening of 21 June, the AFU attacked the RF Armed Forces' positions in Pavlovka from the north and west.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe settlement was held by only one Marine unit and fighting ensued. By mid-22 June, Ukrainian units had seized the village and its surroundings and several Russian servicemen had been taken prisoner. The small village of Shevchenko was also under the control of the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nOn the same day, Ukrainian units attempted to build on their success and launched an offensive on Ygorovka, but encountered resistance from Russian Armed Forces units and a separate battalion and tactical formation (OBTF) of the DNR Interior Ministry. Heavy clashes broke out on the outskirts of the village.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f The following day, 23 June, several AFU companies attempted to enter the rear of allied forces in Yegorovka via a gully, but were quickly discovered by an OBTF UAV. Artillery fire was opened on the advancing forces, and Russian Air Force helicopters arrived and accurately covered them from the air.\n\nThe Ukrainian units suffered very heavy losses and retreated to Pavlovka. According to radio intercepts, the survivors refused to go into the next attack and accused their own command of treachery and sabotage.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f Since 23 June, Allied forces have been leading a counteroffensive in the area: they have pushed back the Ukrainian army from Yegorovka and established control over Shevchenko, deploying positions there. Pavlovka is still occupied by the Ukrainian army.\n\nWhat's the bottom line?\n\n\ud83d\udd3bThe offensive failed to achieve even significant tactical successes. The Ukrainian attack has been stifled, with heavily outnumbered Russian Armed Forces and DNR National Front units even taking back some of the positions and continuing to occupy the \"grey zone\".\n\n\ud83d\udd3b The Ukrainian command's plan also raises questions: there are no strategically important supply lines or facilities in the area near Ugledar, access to which could seriously complicate the position of the allied forces. The capture of a single village can hardly be called even a satisfactory result given the incomparably higher losses of the AFU.\n\n\ud83d\udd3b Meanwhile, Kiev will try again to launch an offensive near Ugledar. The AFU has no critical problems with manpower so far, so the Ukrainian command will continue to send large numbers of untrained units into battle regardless of losses, in the hope of taking advantage of the numerical superiority over the RF and DNR forces in the area.",

That's why \"if they can keep the same rate\" is such a big if.  Like, these past 3 weeks we've seen them focus entirely on cutting down a tiny area of front.

Now, I've never piloted any aircraft, but something tells me that even if you know how to fly a MiG-29 or whatever, learning how to operate an F-16 *competently* is just a little more complicated than learning how to operate a Javelin/NLAW or even a HIMARS.\n\nI hear this a lot and I'm sure it's true. At the same time, there appears to be enormous advantages to F-16s compared to Ukraine's current fighters.\n\nFor example, Ukraine's current fighters need to use the fighter's radar to help their missiles acquire enemy targets. So when a Ukrainian fighter fires a missile at an enemy plane, they have to keep their plane facing towards the enemy while the middle is in flight, severely limiting their ability to take evasive action if the enemy, for example, fires a missile at them in return.\n\nMeanwhile, modern Russian and US fighters have missiles that acquire enemy targets independently, so they can do things like take evasive action without their missiles losing their targets.\n\nI'm not a fighter pilot, but that seems like an enormous disadvantage to me. And it makes me think that people saying Ukrainian pilots need months or years to train on new planes because US pilots take months or years to train are asking the wrong question.\n\nThe question isn't how long Ukrainan pilots would need to train to fly an F-16 as well as an American pilot, it's how long they would need to train before they would be more effective in combat in the new plane. And I have yet to see anyone try to answer that question in a meaningful way, though the Ukrainian air force apparently thinks the answer is \"a couple of weeks.\"\n\nA different, and probably more difficult issue, would be figuring out how to maintain any donated planes. That's probably something where shortcuts are less viable, and the best option I've seen in that regard was sending US or other mechanics as PMCs.",

Which would you rather have?\n\nThat kind of depends, doesn't it? What's the cost of training and manning 170 artillery pieces? An M1931 has a crew size of 9. Assuming zero increased logistics overhead for the additional 169 pieces, you're looking (including training/admin/ops) at a minimum of a dozen personnel per weapon.\n\nThat means your PzH with **a crew of 5, say 7 to include ops and** training, is going up against a force of **over 2,000 gunners.**\n\nWhich do you think is cheaper now? Your 17 million dollar unit, or putting together a 2,000 man artillery battalion - even if the equipment is free? At 750USD/month your wages ALONE will eat up that 17 million dollars in less time that this war has been running already.\n\nAnd you need to pay that during peacetime, too.\n\nAnd that's just a SINGLE cost.

What&#39;s the cost of training and manning 170 artillery pieces? An M1931 has a crew size of 9.

Your 17 million dollar unit, or putting together a 2,000 man artillery battalion - even if the equipment is free?

Thus under maneuver warfare even almost non existent air force such as the Ukrainian has been shown effective against Russian AD, let alone a modern western one.\n\nSecond, Ukraine has shown to be able to fly helicopters through Russian AD, that's with lesser training, maintenance, and antique equipment with only second hand western intelligence support. They have not done it once, but multiple times, including crossing a contested frontline and striking into Russia as well as flying and landing in Mariupol.\n\nThird even the aging Ukrainian air force is somehow *still* able to penetrate Russian AD and *still* fly effective missions against Russia.\n\nFourth and last, the Russian air force that's supposed to support the Russian AD network is extremely underperforming.\n\n>And what about artillery? The PzH 2000 is a beautiful system, but it costs 17 million euros. For that kind of money you can buy 170+ 122mm Soviet howitzers. Which would you rather have?\n\nUnlike in the case of the air force and AD comparisons, that will result in a western dominance over the sky, here you're closer to the money. \n\n1. I'm not sure whether the cost of manufacturing **new** 122mm howitzer will only cost as much. More likely that was the price back when, and is not adjusted for inflation. Your comparison further falls short due to:\n2. You're not factoring in the price in supporting these systems, 170 howitzers demand a much larger number of trained soldiers (which must also be supported in peacetime), their shelter, food, equipment, support vehicles and command structure. \n3. Logistic footprint, you need many more shells to support the 122mm howitzers, and a much more robust logistic system.\n\nThus in reality, if we're strictly looking at costs and disregarding other costs in number of soldiers it's not 1:170. I don't have an accurate estimate, but it's probably closer to 1:20/ 1:30 as a very very rough guestimate.\n\nThe Russian systems still come out ahead in my eyes on this.\n\nBut then, lets compare to CAESER with a cost of $7.5 million. Now we're probably looking at 1:10- 1:15 ratio. And in this case it's very well possible that having fewer CAESERS is the better choice.",

                "body": "I think you're partially right but missing the bigger lesson. What this war has shown is that countries need to know what level of military technology they can/are willing to support, and stick to that.\n\nI think you're wrong that the West (NATO) lacks numbers and ammunition reserves for a peer conflict. Not because the West has large amounts of either, but because their strategy is to end conflicts (or that high intensity of the conflict) before those become an issue. Overall, the West could put hundreds of jets, thousands of tanks, etc in the field against a peer to end that conflict. \n\nHowever, if you remove the US from the West, this changes completely. The Afghanistan withdrawal debacle shows that NATO member states couldn't sustain a presence even for a short amount of time without US support. This is where I think you're right. The other NATO members don't have the ability to spend the same amount of money the US does on sophisticated military hardware. They are hampering their overall effectiveness by having a higher cost to benefit ratio. This is where countries need to take a hard look and determine what type of military they can support. \n\nFor example: F-35s cost $110m dollars compared to an F-16E with costs between $40-60m. Granted this was just a quick Google search for pricing, but you can get 2-3 F-16s for 1 F-35. For a Western ally that's probably not going to fight stealth fighters, that's a good deal. \n\nHowever, if you're a smaller country that can't support a large airforce, focusing on air denial using SAM launchers would let you protect yourself from airstrikes in a cost effective manner. This is the Soviet/Russian approach but it does work as shown in Ukraine where neither side has air superiority. You can then focus on artillery whether it be shells or rockets. \n\nAnd that's where your other point about overly investing sophisticated and expensive technologies I think hits another point. The Western (NATO) countries generally seem to try to want how the US has set up its military and in the end just end up with less effective copies of the US military due to not being able to field the same amount of equipment, and with the same deficiencies. This isn't those countries fault either as the US pushes this idea for coordination purposes. Instead, they should look to complement the US to cover its deficiencies in a cost effective manner as well as provide themselves strong defensive capabilities in their own territories. \n\nFinally, this lesson also applies to Russia. Policy wise, it never realized it went from a superpower as the USSR to a regional power as the Russian Federation. While it uses a lot of cost effective equipment, it also spent a lot of time and resources on designing a newer generation tank and fighter where their current ones worked fine for their new status (and export price). Hypothetically that time and money could have been reinvested, maintaining/improving their military's effectiveness against regional adversaries.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think you&#39;re partially right but missing the bigger lesson. What this war has shown is that countries need to know what level of military technology they can/are willing to support, and stick to that.</p>\n\n<p>I think you&#39;re wrong that the West (NATO) lacks numbers and ammunition reserves for a peer conflict. Not because the West has large amounts of either, but because their strategy is to end conflicts (or that high intensity of the conflict) before those become an issue. Overall, the West could put hundreds of jets, thousands of tanks, etc in the field against a peer to end that conflict. </p>\n\n<p>However, if you remove the US from the West, this changes completely. The Afghanistan withdrawal debacle shows that NATO member states couldn&#39;t sustain a presence even for a short amount of time without US support. This is where I think you&#39;re right. The other NATO members don&#39;t have the ability to spend the same amount of money the US does on sophisticated military hardware. They are hampering their overall effectiveness by having a higher cost to benefit ratio. This is where countries need to take a hard look and determine what type of military they can support. </p>\n\n<p>For example: F-35s cost $110m dollars compared to an F-16E with costs between $40-60m. Granted this was just a quick Google search for pricing, but you can get 2-3 F-16s for 1 F-35. For a Western ally that&#39;s probably not going to fight stealth fighters, that&#39;s a good deal. </p>\n\n<p>However, if you&#39;re a smaller country that can&#39;t support a large airforce, focusing on air denial using SAM launchers would let you protect yourself from airstrikes in a cost effective manner. This is the Soviet/Russian approach but it does work as shown in Ukraine where neither side has air superiority. You can then focus on artillery whether it be shells or rockets. </p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s where your other point about overly investing sophisticated and expensive technologies I think hits another point. The Western (NATO) countries generally seem to try to want how the US has set up its military and in the end just end up with less effective copies of the US military due to not being able to field the same amount of equipment, and with the same deficiencies. This isn&#39;t those countries fault either as the US pushes this idea for coordination purposes.

However, looking at it from a holistic approach, having 2-3x fighter craft will give additional flexibility to respond to threats and to have a reserve. Additionally, if in a conflict airbases are hit, having more planes spread out reduces the overall loss. Even if the planes survive but airfields have to be repaired, that means a much larger investment is sitting idle versus smaller ones. Like I said before, keeping a clear vision is important. A smaller NATO country shouldn't ever be fighting an F-35 and if it is engaging against a non-NATO country with stealth aircraft it should hope that the US has other F-35s (or really F-22s) to deal with them.\n\n>Also, Russian advanced arms development helps them export to wealthier middle income countries like India and Vietnam, which have expressed interest in Russians 5th generation planes\n\nI didn't consider that.
