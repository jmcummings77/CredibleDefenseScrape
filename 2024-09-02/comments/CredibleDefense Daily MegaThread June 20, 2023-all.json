The defense cap in the debt limit bill is $886 billion, and the panel\u2019s allocation for national security programs is $826 billion.\n\n>The defense spending proposal is the first salvo in what is likely to be a fight in Congress over national security spending and competing priorities for the GOP and Democrats. The US is the linchpin for security assistance to Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia\u2019s invasion, at the same time Washington prepares for competition and conflict with China in the Pacific region.

As Washington sent Ukraine Raytheon Technologies Corp.\u2019s Stinger surface-to-air missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, made by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp., along with Howitzers and ammunition, it started to deplete its own stockpiles, demonstrating a lack of resilience. \n\n>While the defense panel allowed multiyear contracts for munitions, it denied the military the ability place bulk orders in the early years of the contracts for components \u2014 so-called Economic Order Quantities \u2014 on the promise of cost savings, which the panel assessed haven\u2019t been adequately documented and won\u2019t materialize. Forgoing the block buys would save $1.9 billion that can be shifted to other programs.\n\n>Instead, the panel\u2019s draft spending proposal requires the military services to request annually the specific dollars used to buy components. Such requests are meant to strengthen congressional oversight. The five munitions that received committee backing are the Naval Strike Missile made by Raytheon and Kongsberg Defence Aerospace, Patriot Pac-3 missile Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, and Long-range anti-ship missiles \u2014 all made by Lockheed Martin.\n\n>House Democrats, meanwhile, have criticized the Republicans\u2019 multiyear funding strategy as a failure to \u201ccounter Chinese Communist Party threats.\u201d\n\n>>Pentagon Civilians \n\n>Calvert\u2019s panel wants to save $1.1 billion by reducing the Defense Department\u2019s civilian workforce through a combination of annual attrition of personnel \u2014 up to 10% a year \u2014 *and using automation and artificial intelligence to modernize operations and require fewer people, a keen interest of the chairman.*\n\n>\u201cWe need to reform, disrupt the department \u2014 almost throughout the private sector, you see people using their workforce more effectively and more efficiently,\u201d Calvert said in the interview. \u201cWe are not talking about firing anybody. The civilian personnel levels are at the highest level, proportionally to the military, than they have ever been.\u201d\n\n>The Defense Department has more 800,000 civilian employees costing $100 billion a year, he said, and the reduction proposed represents 1%. \u201cIt is a start. And over time, then we find efficiencies and we get better outcomes,\u201d he added, citing changes in payroll and accounts payable.\n\n>Here are some of the other cuts the defense panel proposes shifting into other accounts to help stay within the defense cap:\n\n>* $402.4 million from Boeing Co.\u2019s MQ-25 Stingray refueling drone for aircraft carrier jets due to contractor management challenges that have slipped aircraft deliveries to fiscal 2024 and 2025 instead of this year;\n>* $150 million from the Air Force request for continued development of the Lockheed Martin ARRW hypersonic weapon, essentially ending the program that\u2019s had a mixed test track record;\n>* $82.4 million in what the panel calls \u201cunjustified growth\u201d in the cost of shipbuilder studies for the new SSN(X) submarine;\n>* $45 million requested for the poorly performing Raytheon OCX series of ground stations for controlling US GPS satellites;\n>* $28 million in what the committee calls \u201cunjustified cost growth\u201d in Boeing F15EX jet support costs which grew to $108 million from $80 million this year;\n>* $27 million requested by the Space Force for outfitting a \u201cConsolidated Space Operations Facility\u201d in Colorado that won\u2019t be occupied until 2027;\n\n>>Aircraft and Ships\n\n>The spending proposal, meanwhile, would boost the Air Force\u2019s fleet by three Lockheed F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, above the Pentagon\u2019s request of 48 planes for the service.

US took a HUGE gamble during the cuban missile crisis betting the USSR wouldn't force the blockade \n\nGood point, but note that the US specifically avoided a 'blockade' during the Cuban missile crisis because that is an internationally-recognized act of war. The US declared a 'quarantine' to ensure that offensive weapons were not being delivered to Cuba, though food, fuel, medical supplies, etc. were allowed. If China wanted to block shipments to Taiwan, I would expect a similarly nuanced approach to complicate any response to it.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that Taiwan of today and Cuba of 1962 are vastly different in their ability to respond to provocation. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuba had just received and assembled 41 MiG-21s two months prior, but still didn't have trained pilots to operate them. They had also received but not yet assembled a squadron of IL-28 bombers. Their usable airforce was essentially just six B-26 bombers and three Hawker Sea Fury fighters. They had no significant navy. There was essentially nothing Cuba could do to stop or meaningfully hinder a US-imposed quarantine.\n\nTaiwan has too large of a navy and airforce to properly cover in a Reddit comment, but I will highlight that they have over 200 Harpoon missiles (including 60 air-launched Harpoons), an unknown number of domestically-produced anti-ship missiles (which can be launched from ships or trailers), four diesel-electric submarines, around 700 torpedoes (mostly from the US), four US-built destroyers with modern CIWS and enhanced anti-aircraft capability, 115 F-16s, and plenty of other supporting vehicles and equipment. If they get blockaded, I think it will suffice to say that they could inflict a lot of damage on the PLAN if they decide to do so.\n\n>US could, in response, also simply counterblockade China by cutting off its access to Pacific ocean from further away.\n\nChina is beginning to insulate itself from this possibility through: \n\n* The [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) to trade over multiple land routes, primarily through railways crossing its western borders and extending across Asia and the Middle East all the way to Turkey, Pakistan, Poland, Germany, etc. Gwadar Port in Pakistan also links the Belt and Road project to Africa by sea.\n\n* [Rapid expansion of renewable energy sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China) (reportedly now at 43.5% renewable power production) \n\n* A rapidly-growing [electric vehicle industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_China). Long distance travel is already done mostly by high-speed electric trains. Subways are common in most urban centers and electric buses are being implemented rapidly (500,000 in service as of 2020, 98% of the world's stock at that time). \n\n* New partnership with Russia, e.g. the [new natural gas pipeline](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-russia-china-agree-30-year-gas-deal-using-new-pipeline-source-2022-02-04/) and trade deal they agreed upon shortly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n* Rapid development of its navy building towards an expeditionary military capacity alongside a highly capable shipbuilding industry.\n\nA US blockade against China at or near the Strait of Malacca would have been crippling a decade ago, and would certainly still be quite a hindrance to China for now, but in a few more years, it might just be a minor annoyance.\n\nFurthermore, if China decides to invade Taiwan, I fully expect that decision to be delayed until the US is tied up with other matters. Odds are decent that within the next 4-8 years, the US will be tied up at some point with some kind of internal political crisis, some other war, etc. Russia and China have both pivoted towards hybrid warfare when it comes to dealing with the US military, so I expect increased propaganda efforts aimed at destabilizing the US rather than risking any direct conflict with the US.",

Currently, eighty percent of China\u2019s oil has to pass through the Strait of Malacca, a narrow stretch of water between the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. With Singapore, a major US ally that frequently participates in US naval drills, located at the mouth of the strait\u2019s eastern opening, the Strait of Malacca becomes a natural strategic chokepoint. In the event of a conflict, the Malacca Strait could easily be blocked by a rival nation, cutting off China from crucial energy resources. The closest alternative is the Sunda Strait whose narrowness and shallowness make it unsuitable as a passageway for large, modern ships.

Although this option is comparatively more expensive than others, it notably maintains China\u2019s connection to Middle Eastern oil supplies in an efficient and comparatively secure manner, should a crisis arise in the Strait of Malacca.\n\nAs I said in my previous reply, in a few more years, blockading the Strait of Malacca may only be minor annoyance rather than a serious crisis for China.",

The Taiwan Strait alone is one of [the busiest and most important shipping lanes on the planet](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012111/pdf), hosting tens of thousands of ships every year. Blockading shipping lanes nearby would involve strangling [a massive portion of intra-China shipping, and even a huge chunk of US-China shipping](https://www.shiplilly.com/blog/asia-north-america-ocean-shipping-routes/). The destabilizing effects of such an action would be massively devastating to all parties, including China. China's entire naval capacity would basically be saturated just managing domestic traffic through the area, let alone trying to deal with adversaries actively attempting to get aid to Taiwan.

Just a few days ago, we had Putin out in public saying Russia was not going to use nuclear weapons, reiterating the doctrine in such a way as to be threatening but also reasonable. \"Russia has no need to use them and we're doing everything in our power to avoid a situation where we have to use them.\"  \nTwo days later, Karaganov the Kremlin Whisperer and somewhat respected Russian intellectual (prior to the war) drops an article about how the Russians should launch a preventative retaliatory nuclear strike on central Europe. This has sparked a \"debate\" among Russian state-controlled media about whether or not this is a good idea. There was some light pushback, enough to show that Russia is not insane of course, but not enough to end the \"debate\" strongly in favor of one side or another.   \n\n\nNow two days later, Dimitri Trenin (who admittedly has been on the nutso train since this war started), an intellectual with close ties to the West (he served as a non-NATO senior researcher at the NATO defense college, among many other things) is parroting Karaganov's insanity. The idea here is clearly to indicate to the West, namely Europeans, that serious Russian thinkers with serious ties to the Kremlin are seriously considering the nuclear option. Clearly, instead of having Putin run out and rattle the saber or having Medvedev drunkenly fire off some bullshit, Russia is leaning hard on the \"well now look here Euros, even smart men, men you respected, are talking about nukes now.\" It's meant to show that nuclear use isn't some fantasy of the Kremlin or bluster, but rather a genuine consideration and discourse among the Russian elite and Russian society as a whole. It's a fascinating tact to take. It shows commitment to the cause from the elite, it shows the idea that Russian society is seriously capable of considering this, and it genuinely makes the threat feel more holistic and real. It's also an explicit targeting of Europe, not Ukraine, which is a shift I would say in the Kremlin implicit threats. Because these intellectuals have ties to the Kremlin, it also sparks Western intellectuals to say things like, \"Well, this is clearly the Kremlin messaging, should we take this more seriously etc etc\" which perpetuates the discourse. Tie it to the whole Belarus nuclear move and Russia is doing an excellent job of keeping its big leverage tool, the nukes, shoehorned into the news cycle/social media discourse of the West during this counteroffensive, keeping it there so everyone remembers that if Ukraine goes too far, they'll do the big bad thing.",

Similarly, in the past Putin's Kremlin considered China a threat, trying to lure Japan to an alliance (through solving the Kuril Islands dispute in 2018, see Abe visit to Russia and apparent peace treaty). Similarly, Russian strategic circles understand they are being pushed out from the East by Chinese influence. Entire \"Special Military Operation\" was about increasing Russia's position in Europe, push out USA and change the balance of power in a way that would enable to create an economic zone from Lisbon to Vladivostok.

Finland/Poland/Czechia/Slovakia/Romania see the threat as well and will support these countries if required.

Total failure now, but prior to the war Putin was a playmaker in Europe, visiting Macron, building energy & capital relations with Germany with sidelined voice Balts/Poles or even USA. Moron just wanted too much too quickly to become a historical hero. Current one-sided 'Sino-Russian alliance' is necessity bred by failure and a leverage on USA to back-off and negotiate an off-ramp for Russia as common American view is that Siberia under indirect control of China would give CCP means to actually challenge USA's hegemony.",

My uncle couldn&#39;t get into a university in Ukraine, he was explicitly told that it&#39;s because he&#39;s Jewish.  People don&#39;t just forget this stuff. Let&#39;s not underplay actual social issues in Ukraine, this isn&#39;t a football game.</p>\n</div>",

This basically wiped out the last Panzer reserves on a largely pointless attack against American Infantry, leaving the rest of the army with no mobile reserve to counter the Allied advance; and any further defensive lines would likely have just been bypassed since the German infantry was so foot-bound whereas even your average American Infantry Division was fully motorized and had almost a hundred armored fighting vehicles apiece.</p>\n</div>",

Pratt & Whitney\u2019s latest-generation GTF engine powers the Airbus A220s as well as some A320-neo family jets, although they have had some durability issues in particular in hot and dusty climates.  \n>  \n>About 100 aircraft were on the ground awaiting engines, he said.  \n>  \n>Adding to the challenge is Airbus\u2019s planned increase in production of its single-aisle aircraft to meet resurgent demand from airlines.  \n>  \n>\u201cThere is a natural tension between delivering engines to Airbus versus delivering spare engines to our customers,\u201d said Hayes.  \n>  \n>The company is bringing on additional capacity both in the supply chain and in its maintenance operations.

Harassment at best. \n\nThere's a serious ongoing debate over who can handle the Russian bombardment for longer, so not sure why you think this is something that can be dismissed out of hand. Regardless, having the ability to produce longrange missiles is much better than being reliant on Western largesse for obvious reasons. \n\n>Again, most are intercepted. \n\nAgain, which side can keep this up for longer? Especially as Russia brings more capacity online in the coming months. \n\n>And can't do anything decisive with that, so where is the advantage? \n\nAre you seriously trying to argue that Russia having a 10x bigger air force is no big deal? We already know that Russia is now using their aircraft to deliver their equivalent of JDAMs which can be devastating to Ukrainian forces who have no good response to them. KA-52s seem to be performing well on defense, and Ukraine has no comparable aircraft of their own. \n\n>Because their SHORAD is guarding the cities, and that was a choice.\n\nCorrect, Ukraine doesn't have anywhere near enough AD to manage the Russian threats AND is running out of key munitions as the war goes on. Remember how you said the Shaheds were no big deal? Well now Ukraine needs to either defend their cities or defend their frontline forces, and arguably can't do either as effectively as they'd like, which is causing them quite a bit of trouble. Plus what happens when Ukraine fully depletes its S-300 and Buk stores? \n\n>Not in Ukraine they don't, the total number of Russian tanks in storage somewhere in Siberia is a meaningless number when they aren't fighting in Ukraine. \n\nThe leaks seem to suggest that Ukraine now has the advantage in tanks, but who knows how accurate that assessment was. Regardless of the tank situation, Russia still has a massive advantage over Ukraine in AFVs, hence why Ukraine is attacking in MRAPs and HMMWVS, while Russia is using BMPs and BTRs. \n\n>And? The Ukraine Air Force can't gain air superiority, but neither can the VKS. So we're back to a draw on air power. \n\nThe difference in air power isn't \"a draw.\" As previously noted, Russia has its own version of JDAMs that Ukraine has no response to. Russian planes might not be able to control the skies over Ukraine, but they're waaay safer in sky than Ukraine's planes are, even hundreds of kilometers behind the line. Ukraine still has no response to Russian longrange missiles that can knock Ukrainian planes out of the sky with little warning, reducing the range and effectiveness of the JDAMs Ukraine has received. \n\n>First off, no the Ukraine defense industry wasn't bombed into rubble. \n\nIt's not operating anywhere near pre-war capacity, it's been dispersed due to the threat of Russian longrange fires (something you handwaved away previously) which reduces throughput and efficiency, and Ukraine has a shortage of skilled labor since they need so many men for their military. \n\n>There are Russian T-62s and T-54s fighting in Ukraine for a reason.\n\nCorrect, because they were easy for Russia to refurbish/they were already ready to go. They're still better than nothing at all. It's unclear what exactly the status of Russian production/refurbishment is at the moment though. \n\n>I wonder why you think that. But even RUSI said they're using more mortars and tanks for long range indirect fires due to artillery piece and ammo shortages. \n\nRussia has no shortage of artillery pieces, it does likely have some shortages of ammunition or possibly ammunition supply throughput. Everyone agrees Russian fires still outnumber Ukrainian fires dramatically (though less than the 5 to 1 or even 10 to 1 from earlier in the war). Russia absolutely still has an advantage in artillery, though Ukraine likely has an advantage in precision fires. \n\n>So did Ukraine from February 2022 through the Winter Offensive. Did that make Russia the underdog for a year plus having to attack those fixed fortifications? \n\nHonestly, yes to an extent. Russia had lots of trouble in places like Soledar, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka due to Ukraine's extensive fortifications. They managed to overcome them (to an extent) only through the application of their advantages in longrange fires, airpower, and manpower. Ukraine doesn't really have those same advantages, so they're likely to struggle just as much with Russian defenses. \n\n>That's about the only legit and meaningful advantage on this list, but Russia has more of that than anyone in the world. If the US entered this war as an active participant, Russia would still have more EW, but the US wouldn't be the underdog then either.\n\nAgain, why are you dismissing this key advantage? Drones are absolutely critical in this conflict, and Russian EW are highly effective at negating Ukrainian drones. They've also proven effective at disrupting Ukrainian precision fires from GMLRS and Excaliburs, which is really one of Ukraine's only major advantages over the Russians.",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>And do what with them? Most get intercepted by Ukraine GBAD. Harassment at best. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a serious ongoing debate over who can handle the Russian bombardment for longer, so not sure why you think this is something that can be dismissed out of hand. Regardless, having the ability to produce longrange missiles is much better than being reliant on Western largesse for obvious reasons. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again, most are intercepted. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, which side can keep this up for longer? Especially as Russia brings more capacity online in the coming months. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And can&#39;t do anything decisive with that, so where is the advantage? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are you seriously trying to argue that Russia having a 10x bigger air force is no big deal? We already know that Russia is now using their aircraft to deliver their equivalent of JDAMs which can be devastating to Ukrainian forces who have no good response to them. KA-52s seem to be performing well on defense, and Ukraine has no comparable aircraft of their own. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because their SHORAD is guarding the cities, and that was a choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Correct, Ukraine doesn&#39;t have anywhere near enough AD to manage the Russian threats AND is running out of key munitions as the war goes on. Remember how you said the Shaheds were no big deal? Well now Ukraine needs to either defend their cities or defend their frontline forces, and arguably can&#39;t do either as effectively as they&#39;d like, which is causing them quite a bit of trouble. Plus what happens when Ukraine fully depletes its S-300 and Buk stores? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not in Ukraine they don&#39;t, the total number of Russian tanks in storage somewhere in Siberia is a meaningless number when they aren&#39;t fighting in Ukraine. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The leaks seem to suggest that Ukraine now has the advantage in tanks, but who knows how accurate that assessment was. Regardless of the tank situation, Russia still has a massive advantage over Ukraine in AFVs, hence why Ukraine is attacking in MRAPs and HMMWVS, while Russia is using BMPs and BTRs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And? The Ukraine Air Force can&#39;t gain air superiority, but neither can the VKS. So we&#39;re back to a draw on air power. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The difference in air power isn&#39;t &quot;a draw.&quot; As previously noted, Russia has its own version of JDAMs that Ukraine has no response to.

Dr. Mastro argues that it will be difficult to deter China\u2019s efforts \u2014 perhaps even more difficult than it was to deter the Soviet Union\u2019s efforts during the Cold War.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/)\n\nThere are incredibly detailed posts by the [deleted] user (Chimera-Patchwork?), who (credibly?) claimed to be a member of the U.S. intelligence community focused on modeling potential conflict scenarios with China over Taiwan.\n\nThe whole thread is worth reading, though feel free to skip over the TSMC/chip fab portion of the discussion if you're short on time.\n\nReaders should be aware that other folks here have Opinions about that thread. See this discussion from  [CredibleDefense Daily MegaThread June 16, 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14auzpr/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_16_2023/joepux3/) (which is where I first came across it).\n\nWith that said, here's one of many interesting posts from the thread:\n\nUser asks:\n\n>Why would this be a disadvantageous conflict for the US? Am I incorrect in thinking that the US would have the upper hand in a naval conflict with China?\n\nChimera-Patchwork [responds](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia5fi6k/):\n\n>Indeed you are. Feel free to read through my other posts a bit if you'd like some lengthy description, but the Western Pacific (within the second island chain, to be specific) heavily favors the PLA, and everything within the first island chain may as well be considered a writeoff.\n\n>While the PLA of 15, or even as recent as 10 years ago was hardly a mach for US forces at their doorstep, the strides they've made in basically every single aspect of their armed forces are extremely impressive. A Navy with modern DDGs countable on one hand, an Air Force comprised of largely antiquated Soviet Era relics, an Army barely at the foot of the modernization mountain, and an overall technological base still far behind that of the US. These were the PLA's branches circa 2010.\n\n>As of today, they have arguably one of if not outright the most modern (from a systems perspective as well as a totalistic whole-force-design perspective), comprehensive, and capable systems of warfighting in the world, a close second only to the United States. I could go through every single vessel in the PLAN and describe it, but suffice to say, their 30+ modern DDGs, each with more potent ASuW suites than anything aboard any US vessel, with sensor and combat management systems easily on par with - and in some areas, exceeding the capabilities of - the US (notably, Type 346A/Bs aboard modern PLAN DDGs, as well as the force-wide \"networking\" of assets together into one cooperative sensor/shooter complex). Their shipborne AAW capabilities are entirely on par with - and again, in some cases exceeding - that of US platforms, courtesy of the HHQ-9B, and soon to increase further with the 5-5-5 munition. They have by far the largest surface-vessel ASW capability of any Navy (including the USN) with all 50 056As, all 37+ 054As, all ~20+ (Currently 6 are being built simultaneously in a single Drydock at iirc Dalian) 052Ds, all 8 055s, and several older platforms such as the imported 956s and, if memory serves, one or more of their 052Cs.\n\n>Not only can the PLAN match us system for system in 7th Fleet at any given time -- they are more capable systems (there exists nothing a Burke can throw at a 052D that could reasonably be expected to knock the 052D out; the inverse is not the case), more competently crewed (I can get into the massive issues facing the SWO community if you want, and how our Navy is hamstrung by a myriad of failings that impact our ability to not just drive the ship, but to fight the ship if it were to come to it; and how it compares to the extremely concerning level of effort the PLA has put into developing capable naval warfighters instead of competent naval box-checkers and division heads), better supported (land based airpower sure is nice - it's like an aircraft carrier but never sinks and hosts way more aircraft!), better sustained (the US auxiliary fleet is in startlingly poor shape, and one of the most common conclusions I have the joy of presenting at my day job is that our forces in the Western Pacific cannot operate at the scale and tempo that is required when fighting a peer threat like China), and holds the initiative in any conflict.\n\n>This isn't even mentioning airpower. The PLAAF and PLANAF are absolutely jaw-dropping in terms of the fires they are capable of generating even out to the second island chain. The PLANAF alone is capable of putting up salvos of high-triple-digit size (YJ-12s and YJ-83s) even out past Japan, and low triple digits out almost to Guam. Again, this isn't even counting the fires that surface forces are capable of contributing to a salvo. The PLAAF as well is capable of abjectly destroying US and Japanese sortie generation infrastructure in the first island chain, and can claim \"supremacy\" anywhere out to about Hokkaido in the north, Singapore in the south, and about 2/3rds the way to Guam to the East. They've had the benefit of designing and procuring their force with all the modern considerations being practically \"freebies\" compared to what we have to do when upgrading airframes. J-16s, J-11BGs, J-20s, J-10B and Cs, and their other newer airframes all sport AESAs, modern avionic suites, modern CEC/Datalink capabilities (including the ability to cue PL-15s from their KJ-500 AEW aircraft, which is impressive), and a myriad of other \"capes\" as the afrl nerds keep trying to call them.\n\n>This isn't even mentioning the PLARF, which is their \"assassins mace\" as is sometimes referenced (in that the PLARF is like a \"single, deadly blow\" weapon capable of taking an enemy out before a fight even begins). My friend Decker Eveleth is working on an updated ORBAT for the PLARF right now, which should be finished in the coming weeks which I'll be happy to send you. In short, the PLA fields an absolutely obscene amount of conventional SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs in their own branch, and they are the sort of thing that keeps analysts like myself up at night. Their ability to strike at targets in Taiwan, Okinawa, South Korea (irrelevant, SK is not likely to become militarily involved in a US-PRC war), and more -- including Guam -- in a matter of minutes, is not something to be taken lightly. Warning times for munitions from Base 61's HGV Brigades are less than 5 minutes from absolute best possible luck, positioning, attentiveness, and availability detection to impact. These munitions are also, unlike Russian analogues, effective. Not only does the PLA have the technological base, the financial resources, and the microelectronics manufacturing and integration prowess needed to develop these sorts of munitions, but they train extensively with them as well. The US Department of State reported that by September of 2021, the PLA had launched over 250 Ballistic missiles in exercises that year alone. All satellite imagery and, while not really meaningful, all video/imagery released by the PLA themselves, shows CEP figures entirely in line with - if not superior to - the most \"generally accepted\" estimates for many of these munitions. Even Iran, who works with exported Chinese technology and assistance, has developed ballistic missiles which have demonstrated an operational CEP of sub 10 meters. Freaking IRAN.\n\n>All of this is meshed together into a modern, sensible, and highly \"informationized\" (PLA term closest in meaning to \"Networked\" as used by the US Military, though more extensive and institutional/systemic in nature - i.e. the employment of autonomous tugs aboard 075s, the employment of AR goggles for equipment maintenance, BMS available to platoon and sometimes squad leaders (analogues) in HMCABs, organic SUAS fielded to maneuver formations at the platoon/company level, an enormous training simulation apparatus, exceeding even the US in many aspects, computerized umpiring of wargames and exercises, and employment of data-centric optimization of their forces based off of the data collected, AI-driven decision making aids for commanders, modern datalinks and information fusion organic to practically every single modern PLA weapon system, PLASSF data fusion centers responsible for taking in all the data collected by all sensors and systems, meshing it together into a more coherent, complete picture of the battlespace, and then disseminating it so that everyone has the best possible picture of the battlespace, and a gazillion other emergent properties) system of generating, sustaining, and jointly synchronizing and employing combat power to achieve desired effects on an enemy operational system (part of the PLA's concept of System Destruction Warfare, and the fires employment doctrine of Target Centric Warfare).\n\n>If you have any specific questions, I'm happy to answer (card carrying SME on PLA threat systems, and I work in OA - specifically the data science side of things - as my day job). just please try to be specific and understand that anything that seems too spicy for me to tell you is probably, indeed, too spicy for me to talk about lol.",

The PLAAF as well is capable of abjectly destroying US and Japanese sortie generation infrastructure in the first island chain, and can claim &quot;supremacy&quot; anywhere out to about Hokkaido in the north, Singapore in the south, and about 2/3rds the way to Guam to the East. They&#39;ve had the benefit of designing and procuring their force with all the modern considerations being practically &quot;freebies&quot; compared to what we have to do when upgrading airframes. J-16s, J-11BGs, J-20s, J-10B and Cs, and their other newer airframes all sport AESAs, modern avionic suites, modern CEC/Datalink capabilities (including the ability to cue PL-15s from their KJ-500 AEW aircraft, which is impressive), and a myriad of other &quot;capes&quot; as the afrl nerds keep trying to call them.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t even mentioning the PLARF, which is their &quot;assassins mace&quot; as is sometimes referenced (in that the PLARF is like a &quot;single, deadly blow&quot; weapon capable of taking an enemy out before a fight even begins). My friend Decker Eveleth is working on an updated ORBAT for the PLARF right now, which should be finished in the coming weeks which I&#39;ll be happy to send you. In short, the PLA fields an absolutely obscene amount of conventional SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs in their own branch, and they are the sort of thing that keeps analysts like myself up at night. Their ability to strike at targets in Taiwan, Okinawa, South Korea (irrelevant, SK is not likely to become militarily involved in a US-PRC war), and more -- including Guam -- in a matter of minutes, is not something to be taken lightly. Warning times for munitions from Base 61&#39;s HGV Brigades are less than 5 minutes from absolute best possible luck, positioning, attentiveness, and availability detection to impact. These munitions are also, unlike Russian analogues, effective. Not only does the PLA have the technological base, the financial resources, and the microelectronics manufacturing and integration prowess needed to develop these sorts of munitions, but they train extensively with them as well. The US Department of State reported that by September of 2021, the PLA had launched over 250 Ballistic missiles in exercises that year alone. All satellite imagery and, while not really meaningful, all video/imagery released by the PLA themselves, shows CEP figures entirely in line with - if not superior to - the most &quot;generally accepted&quot; estimates for many of these munitions. Even Iran, who works with exported Chinese technology and assistance, has developed ballistic missiles which have demonstrated an operational CEP of sub 10 meters. Freaking IRAN.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is meshed together into a modern, sensible, and highly &quot;informationized&quot; (PLA term closest in meaning to &quot;Networked&quot; as used by the US Military, though more extensive and institutional/systemic in nature - i.e. the employment of autonomous tugs aboard 075s, the employment of AR goggles for equipment maintenance, BMS available to platoon and sometimes squad leaders (analogues) in HMCABs, organic SUAS fielded to maneuver formations at the platoon/company level, an enormous training simulation apparatus, exceeding even the US in many aspects, computerized umpiring of wargames and exercises, and employment of data-centric optimization of their forces based off of the data collected, AI-driven decision making aids for commanders, modern datalinks and information fusion organic to practically every single modern PLA weapon system, PLASSF data fusion centers responsible for taking in all the data collected by all sensors and systems, meshing it together into a more coherent, complete picture of the battlespace, and then disseminating it so that everyone has the best possible picture of the battlespace, and a gazillion other emergent properties) system of generating, sustaining, and jointly synchronizing and employing combat power to achieve desired effects on an enemy operational system (part of the PLA&#39;s concept of System Destruction Warfare, and the fires employment doctrine of Target Centric Warfare).</p>\n\n<p>If you have any specific questions, I&#39;m happy to answer (card carrying SME on PLA threat systems, and I work in OA - specifically the data science side of things - as my day job). just please try to be specific and understand that anything that seems too spicy for me to tell you is probably, indeed, too spicy for me to talk about lol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

A few years ago, you could still visually see the differences in build quality between their Navy and Western-constructed ships. And then there&#39;s the quality of their anti-ship missiles. I haven&#39;t actually seen anything about their performance, which is something I&#39;d expect them to demonstrate regularly - but we have seen the effectiveness of US AShMs and air dominance.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, it&#39;s possible that they are secretly really good and the USN is worse, but personally I suspect not.</p>\n</div>",

I characterized it as a medium risk, medium reward option, though it might be better to think of it as low risk, low reward.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Zaporizhzhia would have more time to fortify, making it less likely Ukraine can retake the land bridge.</p>\n</div>",

Something similar in World War One, with large fixed trench systems and a lot of good geography for tunneling. The static nature there made digging an attractive option. But in Ukraine the front line isn't really all that static, weve seen that both sides can shove the other around over KMs if they really want to, so there isn't a great use case. Moreover the nature of the front line isn't that its contiguous, its rather quite open. There are always flanks to strike and opportunities for surface maneuver that mean you can gain more in a day of good fighting than you can dig in a month of tunneling.

It's actually amazing that two situations halfway across the globe and 70+ years apart in time have so many parallels.\n\n[https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/korean-war-diplomacy-armistice-nato](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/korean-war-diplomacy-armistice-nato)\n\nThe Korea ModelWhy an Armistice Offers the Best Hope for Peace in UkraineBy Carter MalkasianJuly/August 2023Published on June 20, 2023In the middle of August 1952, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai traveled nearly 4,000 miles to Moscow to meet with the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Zhou was acting as an emissary for the leader of China, Mao Zedong. The two Communist powers were allies at the time, but it was not a partnership of equals: the Soviet Union was a superpower, and China depended on it for economic assistance and military equipment. Two years earlier, Mao and Stalin had embarked on a joint venture of sorts, giving their blessing to the North Korean leader Kim Il Sung when he invaded South Korea. Their hopes had been high; even though the United States immediately rushed to South Korea\u2019s aid, Stalin telegrammed Kim in the wake of the invasion to tell him that he had \u201cno doubt that in the soonest time the interventionists will be driven out of Korea with ignominy.\u201dThings had not gone according to plan. In the fall of 1950, as troops led by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur advanced through North Korea, China directly intervened. By the middle of 1951, a bloody stalemate had set in along the 38th parallel, the line that had delineated North from South Korea before the invasion. Negotiations between the opposing sides began in July of that year. Their purpose was to reach an armistice and set the stage for discussions about Korea\u2019s future. The talks had deadlocked, however, over the details of exchanging prisoners of war.When Zhou traveled to Moscow in the summer of 1952, the situation was looking grim for the Communists. Airstrikes had destroyed the North\u2019s industrial facilities and heavily damaged every city. Food was short. In February, Kim told Mao that he had \u201cno desire to continue the war.\u201d Around five months later, Kim pleaded with Stalin to bring about \u201cthe soonest conclusion of an armistice.\u201d But Stalin did nothing. Like Stalin, Mao was determined to stand fast in the face of U.S. demands, and he was less worried than Kim was about the battlefield. Like Kim, however, Mao knew that his country was suffering.Over the course of the Cold War, Zhou would earn a reputation as a cool diplomat. Yet arriving in Moscow as the bearer of bad news, he could not have been at ease. His task was to sound out Stalin\u2019s openness to a truce. Stalin had been behind the war, and it seemed reasonable to assume that talk of shutting it down would displease him.The meeting took place on August 20. Stalin wanted to know if the Chinese and North Koreans could increase the military pressure on the United States. Zhou expressed confidence that \u201cboth sides are about equal in strength\u201d but noted that a Chinese \u201cgeneral offensive would be difficult to carry out.\u201d In other words, there were no good military options for coercing the United States. To exude confidence, Zhou reassured Stalin that \u201cMao believes that the continuation of the war is advantageous to us, since it \\[distracts\\] America from preparing for a new world war.\u201d\u201cMao Zedong is right,\u201d Stalin affirmed, according to Russian archival documents. \u201cThis war is getting on America\u2019s nerves. The North Koreans have lost nothing, except for casualties. . . . \\[The\\] Americans understand that this war is not advantageous and they will have to end it. . . . Endurance and patience \\[are\\] needed here.\u201d Zhou praised \u201cthe truth of comrade Stalin\u2019s observations.\u201d Then he tried again. The North Koreans are \u201cwavering somewhat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are in a slightly unsteady state. Among certain elements of the Korean leadership one can detect a state of panic, even.\u201d This seemed to annoy Stalin, who replied that he had been \u201calready informed of these feelings.\u201d Zhou backed off.A month later, Zhou broached again with Stalin the possibility of accepting a cease-fire and putting off contentious details regarding prisoner exchanges. Stalin dismissed the idea as \u201cone of \\[several\\] possible scenarios, but America is not likely to agree to it.\u201d It was clear that Stalin wanted the Chinese and North Koreans to press on and forgo compromise. Zhou was left with little choice but to assent to Stalin\u2019s counsel, which he praised as \u201cvaluable instructions.\u201dThe fighting would rage for another ten months before the two sides would agree to an armistice, albeit on terms that were slightly worse for China and the Soviet Union than those that Zhou and Stalin had discussed. During that time, tens of thousands died, and tens of thousands more were wounded. Ultimately, 36,574 Americans were killed in the war and 103,284 were wounded. China lost an estimated one million people, and four million Koreans perished\u2014ten percent of the peninsula\u2019s population.The armistice ended that bloodshed, establishing a demilitarized zone and mechanisms to supervise compliance and mediate violations. But the Korean War did not officially conclude. The major political issues could not be settled, and skirmishes, raids, artillery shelling, and occasional battles broke out. They never escalated to full-blown war, however. The armistice held\u2014and 70 years later, it still holds.Today, the Korean Peninsula remains a site of high geopolitical tension. North Korea is governed by a dictator who brutally represses his citizens and regularly threatens his neighbors with nuclear weapons. But the carnage of the Korean War is now a distant memory, and the peace produced by the armistice allowed South Korea to develop a robust economy and, eventually, a stable liberal democracy. For all its flaws, the armistice was a success.The war ravaging Ukraine today bears more than a passing resemblance to the Korean War. And for anyone wondering about how it might end, the durability of the Korean armistice\u2014and the high human cost of the delay in reaching it\u2014deserves close study. The parallels are clear. In Ukraine, as in Korea seven decades ago, a static battlefront and intractable political differences call for a cease-fire that would pause the violence while putting off thorny political issues for another day. The Korean armistice \u201cenabled South Korea to flourish under American security guarantees and protection,\u201d the historian Stephen Kotkin has pointed out. \u201cIf a similar armistice allowed Ukraine\u2014or even just 80 percent of the country\u2014to flourish in a similar way,\u201d he argues, \u201cthat would be a victory in the war.\u201dThe negotiations that produced the Korean armistice were long and difficult and took place alongside heavy fighting, before the war\u2019s costs were clear enough to persuade either side to compromise. The same would likely be true today. The Korean experience also suggests that the obstinacy of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2014who, like Stalin, seems averse to compromise of any kind\u2014could be especially obstructive. On top of that, domestic politics in the United States and the gap between Washington\u2019s and Kyiv\u2019s legitimate but distinct interests could trip up a cease-fire.At the moment, debate in Washington often focuses on the question of when would be the right time to start pushing Ukraine to negotiate, and the consensus answer has generally been, \u201cNot yet.\u201d The Korean War shows that, in a military stalemate, it can take a very long time for both sides to clearly see that the costs of continuing to fight are outweighing the benefits. And by the time they do, a great deal of death and destruction can occur without producing any meaningful advantages.If the United States, NATO, and other supporters of Ukraine do decide to work toward a cease-fire, the end of the Korean War offers three practical lessons. First, they must be willing to fight and talk simultaneously, using battlefield pressure to enforce demands at the negotiating table. Second, they should include the United Nations in any negotiations, since neutral arbiters are an asset. Finally, they should condition future security assistance and postconflict support for Ukraine on Kyiv\u2019s willingness to make some concessions.A complete victory for Ukraine and the West and a total defeat for the other side would be a welcome end to the Ukraine war, just as it would have been in Korea. And as in Korea, the risk of escalation confounds such an outcome. Kyiv, Washington, and their partners in opposing Moscow\u2019s aggression should understand that an armistice that both Ukraine and Russia can accept\u2014even if it fails to settle all the important questions\u2014would still be a win.\n\n1/4",

            "body": "This is a stunningly bad article and poor historical analogy. \n\n- The Korean War armistice territorially ended at the pre-war status of a dividing line more or less at the 38th parallel. In Ukraine, at the current lines, Russia will have gained a lot of new territory, and areas that are very important for Ukraine's future economic viability. Even if Russia were to retreat back to its pre-war lines (Donbas and Crimea), an armistice would reward Russia's initial 2014 aggression. \n- Peace on the Korean peninsula has been guaranteed by the continuing presence of US forces, and the promise of US backing should North Korea invade again. Since Russia itself has nuclear weapons, it is very hard to imagine a situation where the US and Europe would similarly place troops on an armistice line in Ukraine, or really do anything that would create the possibility of direct fighting between Russian and NATO forces. A peace would have to be permanent, with mutual recognition of territorial changes. Which leads us back to the previous point. Plus Ukraine may find this unacceptable even if the US were to apply pressure and decrease support. Unlike South Korea in 1953, Ukraine is not a dictatorship. Plus normalizing, again, the idea of territorial change through war is not going to be good in the longer term. \n\n> The Korean War shows that, in a military stalemate, it can take a very long time for both sides to clearly see that the costs of continuing to fight are outweighing the benefits. And by the time they do, a great deal of death and destruction can occur without producing any meaningful advantages.\n\n- You don't know that you are in an unbreakable stalemate until you know. War reveals information about each side's capabilities and resolve. With hindsight, sure, it would have been better to not keep fighting and have an armistice or peace earlier. But that's the fundamental puzzle of war: it would always be better, _for both sides_, to just skip forward to whatever the eventual armistice or peace settlement ends up being, without wasting lives and the country. But obviously you don't know what that will be until it's clear to both sides that they can't or don't want to fight anymore. Furthermore, in the historical analogy, we can't assume that the future behavior of North Korea, South Korea, etc. would have been the same had an armistice somehow been reached in 1951 rather than 1953, before both sides had exhausted each other to the extent they did. Would one or the other side have tried to reopen the war a couple of years down the road? \n- More immediately for Ukraine, I'd say it's a bit too early to call the situation a stalemate. \n\n*****\n\nFWIW I'm really annoyed by these \"let me pretend to care about Ukraine while arguing we should pressure them into a peace that formalizes blatant Russian aggression\" arguments. If you think we should pressure Ukraine (and Russia, somehow, presumably) into giving up, because you are scared of the risk of nuclear escalation, or because you think it's not that important for the US and Europe, or because you think it's not worth the global economic costs, then just freaking say so. Make an argument on the merits. Not with some blatantly obvious insincere care for Ukraine and Ukrainian lives. As if they don't know what's best for them.",

            "body": "BOXED INAs Washington and its partners weigh the prospect of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, they ought to be mindful of the heavy toll that a delay in reaching an armistice produced in South Korea. An outcome that essentially ratified the territorial status quo when negotiations began required threats of nuclear escalation and two years of intense fighting that inflicted more than 150,000 casualties on the United States, its allies, and South Korea and over 250,000 casualties on the Chinese and North Korean side.Perhaps the most important factor contributing to the delay was that the Communists simply took too long to appreciate the true costs of the war and to realize that they could not outlast the United States. Whereas the debacle near the Yalu River in November 1950 had convinced Truman and other Western leaders to pursue negotiations, it had convinced Mao and Stalin that they could win the war outright. As the historians Shen Zhihua and Yafeng Xia have written, Mao had originally wanted to \u201clocalize the war\u201d and simply defend China. The rout of the U.S.-led Eighth Army emboldened him to raise his sights, and he decided that China\u2019s military strength would allow him to drive the United States off the Korean Peninsula, end U.S. support for Taiwan, and secure China\u2019s entry to the UN. It took six months of heavy attrition in which roughly 150,000 were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner on the Communist side for Mao to realize that such ambitions were unrealistic and to seek an armistice based on the prewar status quo. By mid-June of 1951, Stalin had concurred.Even then, however, Mao and Stalin were intent on using continued military action to gain leverage at the negotiating table before agreeing to a cease-fire. Given China\u2019s massive advantage in manpower, they reckoned that the United States could never defeat China in a war of attrition. \u201cOnly by adopting an unyielding position can you win the initiative and force the enemy to yield,\u201d Mao explained to one of his negotiators. \u201cTo achieve these objectives, you should prepare for a test of strength against the enemy through several more months of negotiations.\u201dThe Communist side failed that test. First, a series of hard-hitting U.S., British, and Australian attacks compelled Mao to accept the line of contact as the cease-fire line in the fall of 1951. Then, after Mao and Stalin resisted concessions on prisoner exchanges, Clark subjected Communist forces to an intensified air campaign in 1952, striking targets in Pyongyang and hydroelectric plants that provided power to North Korea and much of Manchuria.According to the historian Shu Guang Zhang, by the latter half of 1952, the war was absorbing roughly 50 percent of China\u2019s revenues. Mao had already raised taxes and had requested a loan from the Soviet Union, to which China was heavily in debt. In August, Mao informed officials at a CCP meeting that the Chinese economy would collapse unless they halved war expenditures. The drain on the state\u2019s coffers was delaying China\u2019s full transition to a socialist economy, and Mao and the party fretted about internal dissent.Though less worried than Kim, Mao had to weigh these economic and political concerns in considering a cease-fire. He did not want to break China, but he also did not want the CCP to appear weak as it consolidated power internally just three years after winning the Chinese Civil War. Mao was in a bind, which is why he sent Zhou to Moscow in August 1952.Stalin wasn\u2019t interested in helping Mao get out of a jam. He wanted only to preserve Soviet military capabilities, use China and North Korea to degrade U.S. military and economic strength, and avoid making any hasty concessions. From his viewpoint, North Korean and Chinese casualties were tolerable. Only when Stalin died in March 1953 did the Soviet position soften. Stalin\u2019s successor, Georgy Malenkov, and other senior Soviet leaders (including Nikita Khrushchev) sought \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d with the United States\u2014continued competition, but with less tension and a lower risk of direct conflict. For them, the costs of continuing to fight over Korea seemed too high.Yet to dwell on Stalin misses another reason that the war did not end earlier. The negotiations were hung up for 18 months by the U.S. demand that prisoners of war get to choose whether to be repatriated\u2014a position driven by an ideological desire to show that communism held less appeal than democracy, and by domestic political pressure to look tough. For Truman, voluntary repatriation was an inalienable human right. In May 1952, he declared that forcible repatriation would be \u201crepugnant to our most fundamental moral and humanitarian principles.\u201d The policy received robust bipartisan support, as fierce anticommunism defined U.S. political culture at the time.When the issue bogged down negotiations, Truman could not backtrack without facing accusations of weakness against communism during an election year. Later on, Eisenhower also worried that right-wing Republicans would cast any wavering on the issue as going soft. If Truman had never made the demand in the first place, the Communists might have agreed to a cease-fire much earlier, possibly before Stalin\u2019s death. Put bluntly, two U.S. presidents ended up allowing thousands of U.S. soldiers to die not in service of any particular territorial goal or tactical advantage but to avoid domestic political backlash.The South Koreans had a hand in delaying the armistice, as well. The entire agreement nearly fell apart after Rhee\u2019s preemptive prisoner release. Rhee\u2019s interests diverged from those of the United States. He wanted Korea unified under his government and had conceded only grudgingly to negotiations in 1951. Rhee also wanted a mutual security treaty with the United States that he hoped would deter the Communists from trying to overwhelm his forces at some future date. Washington had initially demurred; its defense priority in the region was securing Japan. So rather than passively accept the armistice, Rhee sought to undermine it. Even in the wake of China\u2019s retaliation, Washington obtained Rhee\u2019s cooperation only by promising to expand South Korea\u2019s military, grant the country long-term economic assistance, and sign the mutual security treaty it had previously rejected. And Rhee never signed the armistice agreement: Washington just had to accept his word that he would abide by its terms.\n\n3/4",

            "body": "FIGHTING AND TALKINGNorth Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. Two days later, the UN authorized the United States and 14 of its allies and partners (collectively known as the UN Command) to enter the war on South Korea\u2019s side. For the first five months of the war, neither side sought negotiations.The presence of American forces in combat so close to China concerned Mao. In August, he told the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), \u201cIf the U.S. imperialists won the war, they would become more arrogant and would threaten us. We should not fail to assist the Koreans. We must lend them our hands in the form of sending our military volunteers there.\u201d In October, Mao made the fateful decision to send some 300,000 soldiers across the Yalu River to meet the advancing Americans.The Chinese offensive routed MacArthur\u2019s forces. Suddenly, all of Korea was in danger of falling to the Communists. MacArthur called for direct military action against China, not excluding the use of atomic weapons. U.S. President Harry Truman feared MacArthur might trigger a general war with the Soviet Union, which was by then a nuclear power. His team pieced together an alternative. In a joint communiqu\u00e9 issued in December 1950, Truman and British Prime Minister Clement Attlee called for cease-fire negotiations and assured the world that the American side would not use atomic weapons. Meanwhile, U.S. General Matthew Ridgway applied military pressure to coerce the Communists into negotiations while refraining from actions that could cause escalation, such as bombing China, launching operations deep inside North Korean territory, or capturing the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. The United States adhered to the main points of this strategy for the rest of the war.The Communist side rejected U.S. and UN proposals for negotiations, and heavy fighting marked the first six months of 1951. Eventually, Ridgway\u2019s forces recaptured all of South Korea. Despite the Communists\u2019 best efforts, they could not advance farther south. The severe defeat of China\u2019s so-called Fifth Phase Offensive, the largest battle of the war, proved to Mao and Stalin that a decisive victory would be impossible. After behind-the-scenes discussions with the American diplomat George Kennan, Jakob Malik, the Soviet representative to the UN, publicly called for a cease-fire and an armistice on June 23.The talks began on July 10. Three main issues were at hand: the location of a cease-fire line, measures to supervise compliance, and the exchange of prisoners of war. Negotiations on the first issue proceeded slowly. The Communists wanted the 38th parallel to serve as the cease-fire line. The United States, on the other hand, preferred the frontline (or \u201cline of contact\u201d), which was slightly north of the parallel, where the rugged terrain was easier to defend. On November 27, after four months of fighting and talking, the two sides agreed that the line of contact would become the cease-fire line.By the following spring, they had also reached an agreement on mechanisms for supervising the cease-fire. But no headway had been made on the question of how to exchange prisoners of war. Truman demanded voluntary repatriation, meaning that the roughly 170,000 Communist prisoners of war would be free to return to their home countries or seek residence in a different country. The United States claimed that if given such a choice, some 100,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners would elect not to return home. For Mao and Stalin, such a mass defection would undermine the idea that communism would produce a utopia that no rational person would ever willingly leave. In October, after months of deadlock, U.S. General Mark Clark, Ridgway\u2019s successor, recessed the negotiations indefinitely.Dwight Eisenhower was elected U.S. president the following month. When he took office, he and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, publicly and privately signaled that they were willing to escalate into a more destructive war, seeking to convince the Communists that further fighting was not worthwhile.The Korean War never officially ended\u2014but the armistice has held for 70 years.The pause in negotiations and the election of Eisenhower worried many UN members states and U.S. allies, including Canada and the United Kingdom, that feared the war might escalate. Debates at the UN led to a resolution written by the Indian diplomat V. K. Krishna Menon proposing a repatriation commission of neutral countries\u2014Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland\u2014to facilitate the return of prisoners after an armistice. Hoping to avoid a rupture with its key allies, the United States grudgingly went along. The idea would soon become the basis of a compromise.In March 1953, Stalin died, and Soviet and Chinese leaders immediately adopted a softer line on the talks. On April 26, negotiations resumed. In early May, the Soviets and the Chinese cribbed from India\u2019s UN resolution and introduced the neutral nations repatriation commission on their own. Unfortunately, quibbling over minor details dragged things out, and the violence escalated.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>FIGHTING AND TALKINGNorth Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. Two days later, the UN authorized the United States and 14 of its allies and partners (collectively known as the UN Command) to enter the war on South Korea\u2019s side. For the first five months of the war, neither side sought negotiations.The presence of American forces in combat so close to China concerned Mao. In August, he told the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), \u201cIf the U.S. imperialists won the war, they would become more arrogant and would threaten us. We should not fail to assist the Koreans. We must lend them our hands in the form of sending our military volunteers there.\u201d In October, Mao made the fateful decision to send some 300,000 soldiers across the Yalu River to meet the advancing Americans.The Chinese offensive routed MacArthur\u2019s forces. Suddenly, all of Korea was in danger of falling to the Communists. MacArthur called for direct military action against China, not excluding the use of atomic weapons. U.S. President Harry Truman feared MacArthur might trigger a general war with the Soviet Union, which was by then a nuclear power. His team pieced together an alternative. In a joint communiqu\u00e9 issued in December 1950, Truman and British Prime Minister Clement Attlee called for cease-fire negotiations and assured the world that the American side would not use atomic weapons. Meanwhile, U.S. General Matthew Ridgway applied military pressure to coerce the Communists into negotiations while refraining from actions that could cause escalation, such as bombing China, launching operations deep inside North Korean territory, or capturing the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. The United States adhered to the main points of this strategy for the rest of the war.The Communist side rejected U.S. and UN proposals for negotiations, and heavy fighting marked the first six months of 1951. Eventually, Ridgway\u2019s forces recaptured all of South Korea. Despite the Communists\u2019 best efforts, they could not advance farther south. The severe defeat of China\u2019s so-called Fifth Phase Offensive, the largest battle of the war, proved to Mao and Stalin that a decisive victory would be impossible. After behind-the-scenes discussions with the American diplomat George Kennan, Jakob Malik, the Soviet representative to the UN, publicly called for a cease-fire and an armistice on June 23.The talks began on July 10. Three main issues were at hand: the location of a cease-fire line, measures to supervise compliance, and the exchange of prisoners of war. Negotiations on the first issue proceeded slowly. The Communists wanted the 38th parallel to serve as the cease-fire line. The United States, on the other hand, preferred the frontline (or \u201cline of contact\u201d), which was slightly north of the parallel, where the rugged terrain was easier to defend. On November 27, after four months of fighting and talking, the two sides agreed that the line of contact would become the cease-fire line.By the following spring, they had also reached an agreement on mechanisms for supervising the cease-fire. But no headway had been made on the question of how to exchange prisoners of war. Truman demanded voluntary repatriation, meaning that the roughly 170,000 Communist prisoners of war would be free to return to their home countries or seek residence in a different country. The United States claimed that if given such a choice, some 100,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners would elect not to return home. For Mao and Stalin, such a mass defection would undermine the idea that communism would produce a utopia that no rational person would ever willingly leave. In October, after months of deadlock, U.S. General Mark Clark, Ridgway\u2019s successor, recessed the negotiations indefinitely.Dwight Eisenhower was elected U.S. president the following month. When he took office, he and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, publicly and privately signaled that they were willing to escalate into a more destructive war, seeking to convince the Communists that further fighting was not worthwhile.The Korean War never officially ended\u2014but the armistice has held for 70 years.The pause in negotiations and the election of Eisenhower worried many UN members states and U.S. allies, including Canada and the United Kingdom, that feared the war might escalate. Debates at the UN led to a resolution written by the Indian diplomat V. K. Krishna Menon proposing a repatriation commission of neutral countries\u2014Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland\u2014to facilitate the return of prisoners after an armistice. Hoping to avoid a rupture with its key allies, the United States grudgingly went along. The idea would soon become the basis of a compromise.In March 1953, Stalin died, and Soviet and Chinese leaders immediately adopted a softer line on the talks. On April 26, negotiations resumed. In early May, the Soviets and the Chinese cribbed from India\u2019s UN resolution and introduced the neutral nations repatriation commission on their own. Unfortunately, quibbling over minor details dragged things out, and the violence escalated. The United States intensified its air war on North Korea, and in May, Eisenhower approved a directive that outlined options for a further U.S. advance into North Korea, the bombing of Chinese air bases in Manchuria, and the use of atomic weapons if talks went nowhere.On May 25, 1953, the U.S. delegation presented its final position, which accepted the establishment of a repatriation commission with some minor adjustments.

            "body": "A HARD ROAD TO PEACEToday, as during the Korean War, an independent state is bearing the brunt of an act of aggression, and the ruler on the other side is bent on winning. As during the Korean War, great powers are center stage and nuclear weapons lurk in the background. And as during the Korean War, neither side seems likely to deliver a knockout blow on the battlefield, and neither side seems interested in pursuing a comprehensive peace deal.Given the similarities, some of the same pitfalls that delayed the Korean armistice could hamper efforts to forge one in Ukraine. As in Korea, it might take a prolonged period of fighting to convince the parties to start negotiating. Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Western leaders may wait to talk out of a belief that the battlefield situation will improve or that the other side may break. If negotiations began, that problem would persist. Either side might hope that an improvement in its battlefield fortunes could lead to a better deal, such as a slightly more advantageous cease-fire line or supervisory arrangement.Another roadblock would emerge if Putin adopted a position similar to the one that Stalin held in 1952. Putin appears committed to dismantling an independent, democratic Ukraine and averse to losing any of the Ukrainian territory that his forces have seized since 2014. High battlefield costs may be insufficient to overcome his will. What is more, the possible domestic political costs of making any concessions might further steel his resolve, regardless of the economic and human costs. Even if Putin lets negotiations begin, he may refuse compromise and use stalling tactics to wring concessions out of Ukraine, the United States, and NATO.U.S. domestic politics could also complicate negotiations, as they did during the Korean War. No matter what approach he takes, U.S. President Joe Biden will face an array of attacks on his Ukraine policy as the 2024 election approaches, especially if negotiations start in the coming months. Some \u201cAmerica first\u201d Republicans will complain that continued support for Kyiv is wasteful and reckless. Other Republicans will decry any compromise with Russia as weakness\u2014as will some Democrats. It is easy to see how an armistice could draw domestic criticism if, for example, the text does not recognize an independent and democratic Ukraine, restricts the freedom of navigation for Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea, or leaves Crimea or parts of the Donbas region under Russian occupation.Meanwhile, Ukraine should not be expected to toe the Western line. As Eisenhower learned in dealing with Rhee\u2014and as subsequent U.S. presidents discovered in dealing with leaders in South Vietnam and Afghanistan\u2014a junior partner rarely does whatever Washington wants. Zelensky might resist pressure that the United States puts on him. His interests diverge in important ways from those of the United States and NATO, and so might his strategy. He has long refused to cede any of Ukraine\u2019s territory under Russian occupation, including Crimea and the Donbas. Concessions on those areas could affect his future electoral prospects. Indeed, a cease-fire could leave Ukraine in a far worse strategic position, with lost territory, constricted access to the Black Sea, and an ambiguous security relationship with NATO. Under those circumstances, Zelensky may prove even harder to budge than Rhee was. Furthermore, the United States and its allies have less leverage over Ukraine than they did over South Korea. There are no U.S. military units on the ground; Ukrainians themselves are doing all the fighting and dying. And an alliance guarantee for Ukraine would be controversial. Whereas Eisenhower could easily offer an alliance to South Korea, a U.S. president today would face opposition from some NATO members.NOTHING VENTURED, NOTHING GAINEDGiven all the potential obstacles to an armistice in Ukraine, some might argue that the more realistic option would be to wait for the conflict to freeze, as did the fighting in eastern Ukraine after Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion. A stalemate along the frontline could settle in, and violence could descend to a bearable, steady state. The problem is that a frozen conflict would buy Russia time to eventually return to full-scale war. Putin could wait for his position to improve and then launch another offensive. For that reason, an armistice featuring a signed document, international mediation, an agreed-on cease-fire line, supervisory mechanisms, and enforcement measures remains the least bad option.There are a number of things that Washington and its partners can do to improve the odds of an armistice. First, diplomats should tightly integrate their bargaining with the use of military force: the idea is to fight and talk, not wish for Russian goodwill. A cease-fire in Ukraine would depend on sustaining military and economic pressure on Russia. The United States, NATO, and Ukraine should offer to start negotiations but keep up pressure on the battlefield and other fronts\u2014for example, sanctions\u2014until the Kremlin comes around. That is what Truman did when faced with Communist intransigence in Korea in late 1950 and early 1951. If Russia continues to reject negotiations, Washington and NATO could make the costs of stalling clear to Putin by giving Ukraine more equipment (such as ATACM missiles, tanks, fighter aircraft, and air defense systems) and by deploying special operations forces to Ukraine in a noncombat role. Once negotiations did begin, limited Ukrainian attacks could be coordinated with demands at the bargaining table. At the same time, security and economic assistance to Ukraine could be increased. In 2022, the United States contributed roughly $77 billion and the rest of NATO, $63 billion. They should expect to have to contribute at least the same amounts per year until a cease-fire occurs.In setting up and carrying out negotiations, the United States and NATO should include the UN. Conventional wisdom in Washington today is that the UN is an ineffective diplomatic tool. Dulles mistakenly thought the same thing in 1953, but the organization\u2019s mediation wound up playing a crucial role in the Korean armistice. Today, Russia may find it easier to accept ideas for compromise that come from neutral or friendly countries at the UN than proposals that come from the United States, NATO, or Ukraine. The fact that important members such as India have stood on the sidelines enhances the organization\u2019s credibility in supervising and inspecting cease-fire arrangements.To coax Zelensky toward a compromise, Washington and European governments should closely consult with him in designing the negotiations and ensure that his representatives play a central role in any talks. More important, they should condition postconflict security and economic assistance on Ukraine\u2019s willingness to make concessions. Kyiv is certain to want security guarantees as part of any deal. Although NATO membership is unlikely anytime soon, U.S. and NATO diplomats would be wise to start exploring other kinds of assurances, such as long-term commitments to advise and train Ukrainian forces.Biden will face an array of attacks on his Ukraine policy.There are fewer options to address the single biggest obstacle to talks: Putin. His obstinacy may be insurmountable. The United States and NATO have no good levers to pull if Putin is truly insensitive to the costs of war. Targeting Russian elites with sanctions and supporting Russian opposition movements are superficially appealing. But Washington and its allies have too little access to Russia and too poor an understanding of the country\u2019s political dynamics to bet on success. Hopes that Putin might be deposed seem even more far-fetched. It is worth remembering that Stalin\u2019s intransigence ceased to impede talks in Korea only when he died. Since Putin probably cannot be ousted and probably will not die soon, pursuing negotiations is a gamble that he will cave at some point to military and economic pressure.Thus, there is no guarantee that talks will occur or result in an armistice. Russia may be resolved to outlast the United States and NATO. Washington should bear in mind that its stakes in Ukraine are lower than its stakes were in Korea. It is hard to imagine that any American president would commit U.S. forces to fight alongside Ukrainian ones. Nor would Washington enable Ukraine to levy the degree of destruction on Russia that the United States visited on North Korea: breaking dams, knocking out power stations, bombing the capital. Just because negotiations were successful in Korea does not mean history will repeat itself.Yet if pursuing negotiations is a gamble, it is one with low risks and high potential rewards. Failure would merely yield the same result as doing nothing. Success, however, could preserve Ukraine, allay wider fears for democracy, deter further Russian aggression, and put fears of escalation to rest. The kind of stable, durable peace the Korean armistice produced would be a victory not just for Ukraine and its supporters but for the entire world, as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4/4",

The Americans outwardly calmly reacted even to the deployment of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus. Such \"fearlessness\" is a direct result of the geopolitical changes of the last three decades and the generational change of people in power in the United States and in the West in general.\n\nThis is an extremely dangerous misconception. The trajectory of the Ukrainian war points to an escalation of the conflict both horizontally, through the expansion of the theater of operations, and vertically, through an increase in the power of the weapons used and the intensity of their use. It must be soberly recognized that this trajectory leads in the direction of a direct armed clash between Russia and NATO. If the accumulated momentum is not stopped, then such a collision will occur, and in this case, the war, having spread to Europe, will almost inevitably become nuclear.

The \u201cnuclear bullet\u201d must be necessarily and revealingly inserted into the \u201crevolver drum\u201d, which the US leadership is recklessly playing today. To paraphrase a late American statesman, why do we need nuclear weapons if we refuse to use them in the face of an existential threat.\n\nThe war in Ukraine took on a protracted character. As far as can be judged by the actions of the Russian leadership, they are counting on achieving strategic success, relying on Russian resources that are many times greater than Ukrainian ones, and on the fact that the stakes for Russia in this war are much higher than those of the West. This calculation is probably correct, but it must be taken into account that the enemy assesses Russia's chances differently than we do, and may take steps fraught with a direct armed clash between the Russian Federation and NATO and the United States.
