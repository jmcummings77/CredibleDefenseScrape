        "body": "Another update from \\[ex\\]colonel Mashovets\n\nAnd again about the South...  \n1. The situation in the Tokmak direction continues to deteriorate for the enemy. The advancing units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to expand their tactical \"wedge\" that they drove into the enemy's defenses between the village of Robotyne and the village of Verbove to 5 km along the front and continue to advance from the northwestern side to the \"traverse\" of the Verbove village itself.\n\nAs a result, the enemy's \"volunteer\" BARS-14 \"Sarmat\" battalion found itself almost pressed against the first positions of the enemy's main line of defense...  \nIn turn, units of the enemy's 1430th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the Territorial Troops (MSP TrV) and the right flank units of his 291st MSP are now trying to prevent the advance of the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine through the village of Robotyne... stubborn close-quarters battles are now ongoing in the village itself and the territory of this settlement formally belongs to the disputed (\"gray\") zone. But, if you try to assess the situation soberly and a little more widely... then the position of the enemy cannot be called particularly convenient...  \nUkrainian troops have already, in fact, bypassed the village of Robotyne from the east, moreover, the heights located northeast of the village, which they control, make all the enemy's attempts to hold it... practically useless...  \nBut it seems that the enemy has a different opinion. At least, he began echeloning his battle orders in the direction of Robotyne - Novoprokopivka... in particular:  \n\\- After the 1430th MSP TrV, already well torn... a more or less \"fresh\" 1441st MSP TrV unfolded  \n\\- and to the left of the BARS-14 \"Sarmat\" battalion, another BARS-3 battalion was deployed, apparently with the task of at least stopping (or, if not successful, delaying) the advance of the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine between Robotine and Verbove.  \n\\- in the same place, judging by everything, at least one unit of \"lancetnics\" is deployed and quite actively operating (probably from the 22nd separate special purpose brigade\\\\ arr SpP)  \nIn the village of Verbove itself, the enemy is preparing for a persistent defense. From the western, north-western, and northern directions, the first line of the main defense line has already been occupied by the BARS-1, BARS-11 battalions, units of the 1429th MSP TrV. And in the village itself, judging by everything, the 417th separate reconnaissance battalion (orvb) is setting up positions...  \nBut, as far as I'm concerned, the issue with Robotine may be resolved during this and maybe next week... At least I have some information that speaks for this... Of course, I won't be able to make it public, however. ..I can note in this regard that her character does not allow for an ambiguous understanding of this sentence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. In the Berdyansk direction, the situation is developing in a similar way.  \nAfter leaving the village of Urozhane, advanced units of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (omsbr) and the 247th assault assault regiment (dsp) of the enemy entrenched themselves along the bend of the Mokri Yala river on the northern outskirts of the village of Zavtne Bazhanja...  \nTo the left of this position, apparently, units of the enemy's 136th omsbr, which a day ago unsuccessfully counter-attacked the positions of the advanced units of the Armed Forces southwest of the village of Staromayorske, are clearly preparing to repeat their counter-attacking exercises...  \nThe reason for such suicidal persistence of the Russian troops, especially in this area, is clearly an attempt to hold on to the north of the boundary between the village of Priyutne and the village of Staromayorske...  \nTwo events that happened during the past 2 weeks obviously put those Russian units that still hold positions at the ponds, north of this line, in a rather ambiguous position...  \n\\- Advancing units of the Armed Forces liberated the village of Staromayorske...  \n\\- At the same time, they went to the northwestern outskirts of the village of Priyutne and bypassed the village itself from the north...  \nThus, it became clear that if the advancing units of the Armed Forces continue, for example, to advance in the direction of the village of Volodyne (even without liberating the village of Priyutne, but simply bypassing it from the north), and also continue to advance from the village of Staromayorskoe to the south in the western direction... then the whole shoblo, which continues to skirt a little south of the village of Rivnopillia, may find itself not only in an ambiguous position, but in general - in a fatal one for itself...  \nTo be honest, I still don't see how the Russian command can get out of this situation. It already tried three times to \"ensure the security of the flank\" (right) of these units... And, for this, it even pulled out more or less \"alive\" 136th omsbr from the village of Staromlynivka, after the 247th dsp failed. . But, all three attempts, both with and without Dyusantura, basically ended in nothing...  \nWhen the enemy controlled the village of Staromayorske, the position of these units was more or less tolerable. But after losing control over it, the situation for the enemy began to deteriorate...  \nBut the most interesting thing is that it seems that the enemy command does not even consider the possibility of withdrawing these units to the border between the village of Priyutne and the village of Zavitne Bazhanna (a kind of \"coin flipping game\" with its own personnel on the part of the Russian command continues)...  \nI already wrote that at one time the Ukrainian command chose the direction of the village of Velika Novosilka - the village of Staromlynivka for the offensive. This, in fact, is the junction between the enemy's 5th and 36th combined arms armies (ZVA) ... where, traditionally, there are problems inherent in the Russian army with stable management and interaction ... at the brigade-regimental level ... The story from the village of Urozhane confirmed this once again...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. But, in general, in my opinion... the general situation in the Southern Operational Zone, despite the recent successes of the Armed Forces at the tactical level, looks quite difficult. And this complexity is determined by several factors...  \n\\- the 35th combined arms army of the Eastern Military District (Eastern Military District), at the moment, only its 38th omsbr is partially involved in active hostilities, the rest of its troops (forces) are still \"covering the direction to the city of Polog\". .  \n\\- the 810th and 336th separate brigades of the marine infantry (reserved MP), the 34th omsbr and the 5th separate tank brigade (otbr) + the 7th amphibious assault division (dshd), which is now just \"arriving\" in the strip of the \"Vostok\" AG from the \"Dnepr\" AG... all this code, by and large, has also not been seriously used yet, with the exception of some episodes...  \n\\- the advantage of the enemy in the air component in these directions is also already becoming a ESSENTIAL factor that affects the development of the entire situation in the Southern operational zone...  \nThus, it becomes clear that the enemy's command is actively preparing for various options for the development of events in the Southern Operational Zone... including the one that involves the breakthrough of the Armed Forces of its main line of defense.  \nAt the very least, the creation of a kind of \"untouchable reserve\" from reserve formations in this zone, in particular in the Berdyansk direction, the transfer of a number of units from the composition of the \"Dnepr\" AG to the \"Vostok\" AG, as well as the 70th MSD to the \"Dnepr\" AG is clearly happens according to some plan...",

But after losing control over it, the situation for the enemy began to deteriorate...<br/>\nBut the most interesting thing is that it seems that the enemy command does not even consider the possibility of withdrawing these units to the border between the village of Priyutne and the village of Zavitne Bazhanna (a kind of &quot;coin flipping game&quot; with its own personnel on the part of the Russian command continues)...<br/>\nI already wrote that at one time the Ukrainian command chose the direction of the village of Velika Novosilka - the village of Staromlynivka for the offensive. This, in fact, is the junction between the enemy&#39;s 5th and 36th combined arms armies (ZVA) ... where, traditionally, there are problems inherent in the Russian army with stable management and interaction ... at the brigade-regimental level ... The story from the village of Urozhane confirmed this once again...</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>But, in general, in my opinion... the general situation in the Southern Operational Zone, despite the recent successes of the Armed Forces at the tactical level, looks quite difficult. And this complexity is determined by several factors...<br/>\n- the 35th combined arms army of the Eastern Military District (Eastern Military District), at the moment, only its 38th omsbr is partially involved in active hostilities, the rest of its troops (forces) are still &quot;covering the direction to the city of Polog&quot;. .<br/>\n- the 810th and 336th separate brigades of the marine infantry (reserved MP), the 34th omsbr and the 5th separate tank brigade (otbr) + the 7th amphibious assault division (dshd), which is now just &quot;arriving&quot; in the strip of the &quot;Vostok&quot; AG from the &quot;Dnepr&quot; AG... all this code, by and large, has also not been seriously used yet, with the exception of some episodes...<br/>\n- the advantage of the enemy in the air component in these directions is also already becoming a ESSENTIAL factor that affects the development of the entire situation in the Southern operational zone...<br/>\nThus, it becomes clear that the enemy&#39;s command is actively preparing for various options for the development of events in the Southern Operational Zone... including the one that involves the breakthrough of the Armed Forces of its main line of defense.<br/>\nAt the very least, the creation of a kind of &quot;untouchable reserve&quot; from reserve formations in this zone, in particular in the Berdyansk direction, the transfer of a number of units from the composition of the &quot;Dnepr&quot; AG to the &quot;Vostok&quot; AG, as well as the 70th MSD to the &quot;Dnepr&quot; AG is clearly happens according to some plan...</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

The large-scale \u2018Ulchi Freedom Shield' (UFS) exercise takes place in South Korea during 21\u201331 August.\n\n>According to KCNA, Kim visited a series of North Korean military manufacturing facilities on 11\u201312 August including those that produce tactical missiles, transport erector launchers (TELs), combat armoured vehicles, and artillery shells.\n\n>KCNA reported that these military production facilities have recently been updated to enhance mass production capacity. It also indicated that additional upgrades are planned to meet expanding demands.\n\n>At the missile production factory, Kim outlined a goal to \u201cdrastically boost\u201d manufacturing capacity to enable \u201cmass production of the missiles as required by the strengthened front-line units and missile units and by the operational plans\u201d, KCNA said.\n\n>Citing Kim, the agency added, \u201cThe qualitative level of war preparations depends on the development of the munitions industry and the factory bears a very important responsibility in speeding up the war preparations of the Korean People's Army (KPA).\u201d\n\n>KCNA also pointed to expanded manufacturing targets for the factory that produces TELs. It reported that the TEL factory is also \u201csteadily updating\u201d the design of TELs for the KPA.\n\n>Similarly, KCNA reported progress in North Korea's production capacity in 122 mm and 240 mm munitions. It said Kim also called for a boost in the production of these munitions \u201cin keeping with the army's increased operational demand\u201d.\n\n>Pyongyang regards the UFS exercise as an effort by the US and South Korea to prepare for conflict with North Korea.\n\n>The exercise will involve several thousand personnel from all US and South Korean military services. According to United States Forces Korea \u2013 a sub-unified command under US Indo-Pacific Command \u2013 the exercise is intended to strengthen the two countries' combined defence posture against threats in Northeast Asia.\n\n>Kim's recent visits to the military manufacturing sites continued a theme. Since early August Kim has also visited state facilities that produce munitions, small arms, and engines fitted to cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\n>Indicating growing tensions between North Korea and the US and its allies, Kim similarly highlighted in these visits requirements to increase production capacity to prepare for war.\n\n>The visits also follow North Korea's recent unveiling of new military equipment. At a military parade in late July to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement, North Korea displayed its Hwaseong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time. The weapon, which features a solid-fuel propulsion system, has been tested twice but not publicly displayed.\n\n>In late July North Korea also unveiled two new UAVs. The aircraft were shown during the visit of Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu to a weapons exhibition in Pyongyang. The aircraft resembles the General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) MQ-9 Reaper and the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk.\n\n-Janes' Jon Grevatt, Defense Weekly",

            "body": "The overall gist of what he's talks about is that China has a lot of debt tied up in economically unproductive investments and the Chinese government maintains control over too much of the Chinese economy. The latter takes the form of via wage suppression (mostly of blue collar jobs that work in export-oriented industries) and the SOEs. This keeps households from possessing a greater share of the GDP and thus leads to stagnant household consumption as a percentage of GDP.\n\nIt's all pretty general and difficult to effectively quantify (aside from the stagnant household consumption), especially with the scale of the Chinese economy, but I think he makes some good, albeit very general, points. I would recommend reading his [analysis](https://carnegieendowment.org/experts/444) if you want a better idea.

But whatever it started out, I think it massively changed over time. \n\nHere is my take:\n\nWagner was already starting their prisoner recruitment campaign by early July, which tells us they needed to grow fast, and were already prepping to take heavy casualties and so chose a disposable source. Effectively, Wagner got the Bakhmut contract.\n\nThe Ukrainians telegraphed their southern offensive, talking it up in July, mentioning both Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. In response, the Eastern Military District and much of the VDV were moved out of Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk oblasts (that created the hole later exploited by the Sept Kharkiv counteroffensive).\n\nDespite that, and despite the Russian axis from Izyum not doing well, they still hadn't stopped trying to move south. They were probing around the northwestern side of  Sloviansk trying to avoid the water obstacles and go through the hills toward Barvinkove right up until the Kharkiv counteroffensive caused that entire axis to collapse and retreat. That was one of the screwy things about finding out how the Kharkiv counteroffensive was so successful, that the Russians in that sector were so weak but still attacking. So that is a strong indicator that there was still a pincer planned for Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, still a major priority.\n\nAfter the Kharkiv counteroffensive, everything changed. A totally new strategy in Ukraine followed a totally new commander, who was very defensive minded after their defeats and the dangerous situation Russia faced September-November. Russia was struggling with the strategic crisis caused by the Kharkiv counteroffensive and then the loss of Lyman. They didn't have enough troops, triggering the Kherson bridgehead retreat to both lessen the major risks there, shorten their overall line, free up the VDV and many other units to reinforce Luhansk, which was especially critical because the UAF were pressing on the ad hoc Svatove-Kreminna line, the only thing holding the Ukrainians back from turning the flank to Severodonetsk and getting past the Donbas industrial region by bypassing the Donets River.\n\nWhy didn't Wagner help defend during that terrible time? Well, we now know that Wagner wasn't actually being controlled by the Russian MOD, in fact they were in competition. So even if Zhidko or later Surovikin wanted to take control of Wagner, give them orders to halt the attack on Bakhmut to help support defensive ops elsewhere, they probably couldn't because Prigozhin ultimately reported to Putin. \n\nMore so, they didn't need Wagner to halt attacks against Bakhmut, it actually favored the Russian strategic situation to keep them going. Simply put, they were tying down large and ever increasing numbers of UAF units, especially good ones, and causing significant damage to them. And still advancing. They were the ultimate fixing operation. That was fine for Surovikin, but bad for Shoigu, who saw Prigozhin as a threat. Remember though, Prigozhin and Surovikin supposedly got along pretty well. \n\nThat brings us to the fall mud season, right when the UAF advance on the Svatove-Kreminna line has culminated, due to supply problems (especially ammo) and losses, and the horrible weather. Meanwhile, the Russian MOD forces are consolidating their defenses, still getting their Mobiks mobilized, trained, and deployed to Ukraine, and while they've stabilized the Eastern and Southern fronts they're in no condition to go on the attack. \n\nBut Wagner is. And even as far back as November, the Bakhmut campaign is already being described as a meatgrinder for Ukraine forces. Is Surovikin worrying if they reach Sloviansk or Kramatorsk? I doubt he cares. Everyone else is digging in and getting better prepared as Wagner chews up the UAF. \n\nAnd maybe they do succeed, and might even be able to take Sloviansk and Kramatorsk by frontal assaults, after all that high ground on the ridgeline between Bakhmut and the twin cities is a pretty dominating terrain feature. But honestly, I don't think Surovikin was really focused on Donetsk anymore, I think he was focused on rebuilding the Russian forces and stabilizing the situation, while using a strategic bombing campaign to weaken Ukraine.\n\nThen Gerasimov replaces Surovikin. With that must come a shift in strategy, because the only reason to replace a successful theater commander is because he's not doing something that Shoigu and probably Putin too want him to do. But what is it? Russia needs to go on the offensive. They waited enough, morale is shit and they want a victory, they need to regain the initiative, they need to pursue their strategic objectives (chief is still the Donbas), and they need to exhaust the Ukrainians over the winter so they aren't ready for the spring offensive they've been talking about all December and January. They can't do that on the defensive. And potentially Surovikin refused to attack, so Gerasimov took over, ever the obedient lackey.\n\nBut at this point I don't think Shoigu and Gerasimov are actually interested in taking Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Why not? Simply put, when they launch their winter offensive, none of the axes are actually supporting Wagner's attack. More so, we now know Shoigu is fiercely jealous of Prigozhin and wants him to fail. Based on intelligence and reporting, it's likely Shoigu was  screwing with Wagner's artillery allotments, possibly even of trying to use the meatgrinder battle to destroy Wagner as a fighting force. \n\nMost of the axes involved in the winter offensive are nowhere near the Sloviansk sector, only the Kremmina sector was kinda involved, and that can be explained about wanting to retake the forest to them either establish a better defensive barrier on the Donets River, or maybe a second axis to try to take the Siversk salient after Bakhmut. The rest involved a push against the southeast line in Donetsk from Avdiivka to Vulhedar. \n\nBut even then, none of the attacks are actually supporting one another, it almost seems either the Russians were trying to win a bunch of small battles, and/or they wanted to do a broad front offensive just to tie down the maximum number of Ukraine units to attrit them, as it's pretty clear the Russians have been focusing on an attrition/exhaustion strategy against Ukraine (and vice versa). \n\nIn conclusion, it really doesn't look like there was a concrete strategy since last fall regarding a priority of taking Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.",

This strategic step reflects Norinco\u2019s burgeoning footprint in West Africa\u2019s military procurement arena.\n\nHeading this new regional office is Zheng Yun Gang, a seasoned professional with over two decades of experience in the defense sector. In his role, he will spearhead the expansion of Norinco\u2019s operations not only in Senegal but also across other West African nations.\n\nAlready making inroads into Senegal, Norinco has supplied VN2 armored infantry fighting, CS/VN-3C armoured vehicles, and other reconnaissance vehicles to General Moussa Fall\u2019s gendarmerie through intermediary Thierno Ba, a military equipment broker.\n\nFurthermore, discussions are reportedly underway between Norinco and the Senegalese government concerning the provision of light weaponry and ammunition for the country\u2019s environment ministry.\n\nNorinco\u2019s concerted efforts to enhance its presence in West Africa signal China\u2019s mounting military influence within the region. The corporation is already a major supplier of weaponry to countries like Algeria, Nigeria, and Angola.The inauguration of the new Dakar office is likely to amplify Norinco\u2019s impact in West Africa, potentially prompting shifts in the region\u2019s security dynamics.\n\nBeyond Senegal, Norinco has established regional offices in Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa. Additionally, there are plans to expand further into more West African nations in the near future.\n\nSome of Norinco\u2019s recent activities in the region includes; Supply of VN1 8\u00d78 infantry fighting vehicles for the Gabonese Scouting, Reconnaissance, and Combat Squadron component of the elite Republican Guard Armoured Intervention Group.\n\nThe Gabonese Republican Guard (GR) also acquired some Norinco VP11 mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles which was publicly for the first time during the 17 August Independence Day, 2022 military parade in Libreville.\n\nAlthough, Gabon had complained of some of its Chinese vehicles failing during rigorous combat operations and exercises.\n\nFor Nigeria, about sixty Type-89 tracked armoured vehicles to boost Nigeria\u2019s ongoing and future offensive in the northeastern region against insurgents.\n\nThe armoured fighting vehicles joins several recent acquisitions from China, which includes NORINCO ST1 105 mm Fire Support Vehicle, VT-4 Main Battle Tank, SH-5 105mm self-propelled Artillery System, and  SH-2 122mm self-propelled artillery system. These hardware arrived in April 2020.\n\nSubsequent delivery of additional hardware comprising of VT4 main battle tanks, ST1 120 mm tanks destroyers, SH2, SH4 self-propelled artillery, and KIA tactical vehicles arrived in October 2020.The Nigerian Army already operates 120 NORINCO CS/VP3 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle (MRAP) delivered in 2015.\n\nLate 2021, the Tanzania People\u2019s Defence Force (TPDF) improved upon its 15-strong Chinese Type 59G main battle tanks with new Norinco VT-2 main battle tanks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Malian military government led by Colonel Assimi G\u00f6ita has recently acquired a large number of VP11 4\u00d74 Lightweight MRAP, and Lynx CS/VP11 ATV made by Norinco, a Chinese arms manufacturer to aid in the fight against insurgency.\n\nThe expansion of Norinco in West Africa has garnered support from certain regional countries seeking to diversify their sources of arms procurement. However, for some, the escalation of China\u2019s military presence in the area is a matter of concern.\n\nThe ultimate implications of Norinco\u2019s advancement in West Africa on the region\u2019s security equilibrium remain to be seen.

                "body": "> Harassment and fixing. It forces the Russians to garrison the riverbank.\n\nDefinitely that's the primary objective at the moment, but there are some secondary dynamics and objectives worth mentioning too. At a high level, the Russians are constantly testing to see what is the least amount of forces they can get away with garrisoning in Kherson so that they can maximize the resources devoted to stopping the Ukrainians' primary offensive efforts in Zaporizhzhia and the Russian spoiling attacks in the north. Whereas for their part, the Ukrainians are also constantly testing to see if the Russians have screwed up and failed to garrison the region sufficiently. That back and forth dynamic isn't happening once, but rather constantly and iteratively.\n\nAs the Ukrainians test and find weaknesses to exploit, the Russians are trying to plug those holes without compromising their defense further east in Zaporizhzhia. If a small Ukrainian force is able to stay supplied and entrenched on the left bank, that indicates there is no stronger Russian force both capable of counterattacking and available to do so. The longer such a force isn't available, the greater the deficit of forces on the Russian side will be.\n\nFor example, a weakness could occur because of a brief hole in reserves available for an elastic defense in one sector that opened temporarily during a regular rotation of forces on the Russian side. Once the Russians move the freshly rotated units into place on the line, they should be able to counterattack to push the Ukrainians back across the river, resulting in only a briefly established Ukrainian bridgehead. However, if no relief force is rotating in, then the Ukrainians will be able to hang on longer. All of which is to say that the *length of time* over which the Ukrainians are able to exploit a weakness in Kherson is a significant indicator of the seriousness of that weakness.\n\nThus, establishing and holding a bridgehead for a long period of time demonstrates that the Russians likely have not resourced their defense of the riverbank sufficiently to a significant extent. For Ukraine, passing the \"hold a bridgehead with a small force for X number of days\" gate opens up the possibility of scaling their activities up to larger raids deeper into eastern Kherson or even a fully resourced counteroffensive. In turn (again, iteratively), that forces Russia either to resource a defense against those potential courses of action or instead to accept the risk that the Ukrainians will pursue such an option without sufficient Russian reserves already in place. If they do accept that risk, it suggests they believe they will be able to rotate reserves in from eastern Kherson or Crimea quickly enough after a Ukrainian incursion and do not need to do so preemptively.\n\nOther than the failures at the beginning of June and the Kharkiv Counteroffensive, the Ukrainians have almost always demonstrated a preference for slowly ramping up attacks, proving to themselves they can handle the small scale before making risky bets on a large scale operation. They certainly don't want to repeat June, so I doubt we will see them obviously build up a large presence in western Kherson prior to any attacks across the Dnipro. If only because tactical surprise will be essential to any such operation's success, which notably was a feature missing in June but present for Kharkiv, where Syrsky achieved surprise in part by reshuffling individual battalions off the line to quietly resource the offensive without rotating any full brigades that the Russians might have noticed missing from the line. I wouldn't be surprised to see them take a similar approach in Kherson now, but I also wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it to happen because it would likely be a high risk operation. Purely based on intuition, I suspect they will only attempt a Hail Mary operation across the Dnipro like that if they find themselves running down the clock to mud season without any significant progress in the east to show. But that's just my guess.",

Why in God's name aren't the Ukrainians responsible for training their own troops? \n\nSecond, NATO training is a mix of 1) basic training, 2) training on western equipment, and 3) very limited amounts of collective unit training on combined arms. \n\n1) Is going to suck regardless because competent soldiers, let alone infantrymen, can't be created in 3-5 weeks, that's impossible. 2) Is going to suck because even junior enlisted \"privates\" are expected to get more than the 3-6 weeks of training on new equipment, let alone more senior troops especially the NCO Corps (which the UAF doesn't really have) and junior officers. 3) Only the US Army is doing it, and while it definitely could have been better executed, only a few UAF units attended and it's another impossible task because the wrong military is doing the instructing, in the wrong language, and given resources and time standards that make the mission impossible to do well. \n\nIf NATO training is so bad at warfare, according to internet fans of this war, nobody is forcing the Ukrainians to use it. If western volunteers in Ukraine don't have the requisite personal experience in warfare, according to internet fans of this war, nobody is forcing the Ukrainians to use it. They can just do it themselves. Oh wait, no they can't, because they didn't actually allocate the resources for that. And while their internet fans will swear up and down they have the manpower to go the distance against Russia in an attritional war, they'll also make it clear to us they don't have the manpower to do what ever other quality military in history has done, train their own military. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Yeah yeah yeah NATO can defeat a Russian armored thrust at any time, except Russians don't do armored thrust anymore.\n\nThis is the sort of non-credible comment that points out that you don't know what you're talking about. And yet you're extremely confident and cocky that you're right. \n\nFYI, if we know how to defend against a Russian mechanized attack, do you think we don't know how to defend against a dismounted attack? Or that we don't know how to attack ourselves? \n\nThat we don't know how to use our own tanks and IFV and PGMs, that only Ukraine knows how to use our stuff that we gave them? Why is the Abrams better than the T-72? Why is the Bradley better than the BMP?

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I mean most NATO countries completely screwed up the training pipeline and failed to adapt the courses based on battlefield realities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First of all, this isn&#39;t March 2022, this is August 2023, and the fact that NATO is primarily responsible for training Ukrainian troops is an outright crime. Why in God&#39;s name aren&#39;t the Ukrainians responsible for training their own troops? </p>\n\n<p>Second, NATO training is a mix of 1) basic training, 2) training on western equipment, and 3) very limited amounts of collective unit training on combined arms. </p>\n\n<p>1) Is going to suck regardless because competent soldiers, let alone infantrymen, can&#39;t be created in 3-5 weeks, that&#39;s impossible. 2) Is going to suck because even junior enlisted &quot;privates&quot; are expected to get more than the 3-6 weeks of training on new equipment, let alone more senior troops especially the NCO Corps (which the UAF doesn&#39;t really have) and junior officers. 3) Only the US Army is doing it, and while it definitely could have been better executed, only a few UAF units attended and it&#39;s another impossible task because the wrong military is doing the instructing, in the wrong language, and given resources and time standards that make the mission impossible to do well. </p>\n\n<p>If NATO training is so bad at warfare, according to internet fans of this war, nobody is forcing the Ukrainians to use it. If western volunteers in Ukraine don&#39;t have the requisite personal experience in warfare, according to internet fans of this war, nobody is forcing the Ukrainians to use it. They can just do it themselves. Oh wait, no they can&#39;t, because they didn&#39;t actually allocate the resources for that. And while their internet fans will swear up and down they have the manpower to go the distance against Russia in an attritional war, they&#39;ll also make it clear to us they don&#39;t have the manpower to do what ever other quality military in history has done, train their own military. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah yeah yeah NATO can defeat a Russian armored thrust at any time, except Russians don&#39;t do armored thrust anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the sort of non-credible comment that points out that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. And yet you&#39;re extremely confident and cocky that you&#39;re right. </p>\n\n<p>FYI, if we know how to defend against a Russian mechanized attack, do you think we don&#39;t know how to defend against a dismounted attack? Or that we don&#39;t know how to attack ourselves? </p>\n\n<p>That we don&#39;t know how to use our own tanks and IFV and PGMs, that only Ukraine knows how to use our stuff that we gave them? Why is the Abrams better than the T-72? Why is the Bradley better than the BMP? Why does the US Army spend the better part of half a year training on training the absolute lowest ranking infantryman but we don&#39;t have a clue? </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The failure of training is something very frequently noted by almost everyone, and yet there are little improvements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, and I already touched on that. &quot;Almost everyone&quot; are not credible, &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t know how training is done, period, let alone for this war, don&#39;t know much if anything about military science/art and history.

It's inevitable as people who believe in the future success of the operation probably felt slighted by the contrarians and military analysts earlier when they all started talking about the operation as a failure.

You could feel the two groups attempting to out smug each other just based on daily development of the front.\n\nTo me, this just degrades these discussions into Twitter (X) quality posting. Building up and tearing down each other's strawmen to satisfy their own ego. None of us learn anything through these exercises.\n\n\\-\n\nThe problem, it seems, is just that people have different definition of success and failure, without communicating with each other what it is. Or sometimes they understand there is a difference but chooses to either ignore the difference, or dismiss it.\n\nSo I'd say we should all talk about what \"success\" and \"failure\" means to us, or the UAF. And if we don't define it prior, refrain from building and tearing down each other's strawmen.\n\nI can already tell you through reading analysts and other contrarians on their perceived goals of the offensive, they are going to dismiss this village as a success for now, unless this develops into something fluid in the next few days.\n\nThey do not see the goal of the offensive as capturing land, or village, and they won't measure success based on KM\\^2 captured like pro-RU is doing right now, but rather using their axis of advance to guess the goal. (Although same could be said the other way, measuring RU success/failure on KM\\^2 is a silly thing to do imho) They see the UAF's goal as breaching the Russian defensive line, and to force through one of the \"weak\" spots. (The Tokmak axis certainly is not weak, as evident now) To them, not breaching the line in a reasonable amount of time is failure.\n\nAnd before you go any further on Kherson, these analysts **do see** the Kherson offensive as a failure, but the Russians who put themselves in that no-win scenario is also seen as failure on their part by them too. It's a Russian self-own that led to Ukrainian win, but it had nothing to do with Ukrainian operations at the time for them. Basically, they see the Ukrainian Kherson offensive and judged it based on its operational goal and whether or not they achieved their goals. And to them, the answer was no.\n\nOn the other side, there are people like you who believe that success is measured based on Russian attrition, Russian losses, and victory in positional battle. Success is measured in out grinding the Russians. And the most important part, there shouldn't be any time frame associated with the definition of a success or failure, because if it succeeds in the end, then it was a success after all no matter the length or the path it took to get there. The ultimate victory. You don't judge operations on their own, but rather want to use the end result of the operation to judge its success.\n\nTo be honest with you, I don't think it's an unfair way to look at the situation as well , but I truly wonder if people see this gap in definition when they try to smug each other out.\n\nThis is a point that I think needs to be said every time someone wants to have discussion on success or failure. **Define** what makes an offensive \"successful\" for you when you talk about it.

Even the Kerch Strait isn't reliant on the bridges anymore, they got constant ferry service moving supplies there. And there is no bridge for the Land Bridge.\n\nThere isn't a limited amount of roads, you need to open up Google maps if you think so. \n\nRussians have drone supremacy, not the Ukrainians.
