As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

State-run RIA news agency reported on Tuesday that Shoigu said he discussed Haniyeh's killing on his Tehran visit.\n\n>The two sources with knowledge of the matter did not provide further details on the talks with Shoigu, who was defence minister before becoming the secretary of Russia's security council in May.\n\n>They said Shoigu's visit was one of several avenues Moscow had used to relay to Iran the need for restraint while at the same time condemning Haniyeh's killing as \"a very dangerous assassination\", in a bid to prevent a Middle East war.\n\n>The Middle East, the sources said, was on the brink of a major war and those behind the assassination were clearly trying to trigger such a conflict.\n\n>Russia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Tehran.\n\nI believe there are two potential takeaways from this. Firstly, Russia correctly recognises that a Middle East war is in absolutely no one's interests and, despite their deepening cooperation with Iran, they are making clear this is not a green light for them to act with total impunity (especially as if reports are to be believed they have sent Iran very limited equipment so far).

State-run RIA news agency reported on Tuesday that Shoigu said he discussed Haniyeh&#39;s killing on his Tehran visit.</p>\n\n<p>The two sources with knowledge of the matter did not provide further details on the talks with Shoigu, who was defence minister before becoming the secretary of Russia&#39;s security council in May.</p>\n\n<p>They said Shoigu&#39;s visit was one of several avenues Moscow had used to relay to Iran the need for restraint while at the same time condemning Haniyeh&#39;s killing as &quot;a very dangerous assassination&quot;, in a bid to prevent a Middle East war.</p>\n\n<p>The Middle East, the sources said, was on the brink of a major war and those behind the assassination were clearly trying to trigger such a conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Tehran.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe there are two potential takeaways from this. Firstly, Russia correctly recognises that a Middle East war is in absolutely no one&#39;s interests and, despite their deepening cooperation with Iran, they are making clear this is not a green light for them to act with total impunity (especially as if reports are to be believed they have sent Iran very limited equipment so far). Secondly - as some argued with the optics around the prisoner swap - Russia may see this as an opportunity to present themselves as responsible actors in a difficult international situation if they can successfully lean on Iran to show restraint, and thus lead some more credulous observers to try and push Ukraine/the US to enter negotiations with them.</p>\n</div>",

The UNRWA has its own charter, and several of its provisions depart significantly from those of the UNHCR's charter on refugee status.\n\nThe one that OP is referring to is unfortunately often misquoted. According to international legislation, descendants of refugees do retain their refugee status. Doing otherwise would be ridiculous. Both the UNRWA and the UNHCR recognize this.\n\nWhere the two organizations differ on this topic is in when refugee status ceases, which is why the \"descendent\" status is so murky. The UN Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ceases to apply for persons who have re-availed themselves to the protection of the country of their nationality, acquired a new nationality and enjoy the protection of the country of their new nationality, or have voluntarily re-established themselves in the country which they left/remained out of (Art 1, C, (1), (3) and (4), there are other provisions but these are the most contentuous with regard to the UNRWA). \n\nHowever, the UNRWA does not recognize any of this. It operates under a completely different charter and mandate. People covered under the UNHCR mandate can lose their refugee status under far more circumstances and, obviously, no longer have any refugee status to pass on to their descendants.\n\nI'm not going to inventory all of the weird quirks this leads to because I'd only invite gratuituous and very unempathetic flamewars. However, I would like to point out three things. \n\nFirst, that there are very real historical reasons why various of these things were a good idea at first. For instance, yes, today it sounds pretty ridiculous that an Egyptian national who was born in Egyp and has never fled any conflict in their or their parents' lifetime can be a Palestine refugee, but in the international and Israeli legal climate of the 1950s and 1960s, it made perfect sense. Reviewing them under contemporary conditions is difficult because, UNRWA's politics aside, there really are a great number of people that *actively* need UNRWA aid, and it's hard to revise the UNRWA's status in a way that doesn't hurt them.\n\nSecond, though, and as a consequence of that, it's certainly not just Israeli media that has a problem with this. It has led to very real friction with other parties, including, for instance, refugee groups from countries other than Palestine in the last decades. \n\nAnd finally, that this has shit all to do with the right of return, which has a completely different legal basis (UNGA Resolution 194) that precedes the establishment of the UNRWA. UNRWA statistics are occasionally brought up along with that but it's primarily a rhetorical device.",

The UN Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ceases to apply for persons who have re-availed themselves to the protection of the country of their nationality, acquired a new nationality and enjoy the protection of the country of their new nationality, or have voluntarily re-established themselves in the country which they left/remained out of (Art 1, C, (1), (3) and (4), there are other provisions but these are the most contentuous with regard to the UNRWA). </p>\n\n<p>However, the UNRWA does not recognize any of this. It operates under a completely different charter and mandate. People covered under the UNHCR mandate can lose their refugee status under far more circumstances and, obviously, no longer have any refugee status to pass on to their descendants.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to inventory all of the weird quirks this leads to because I&#39;d only invite gratuituous and very unempathetic flamewars. However, I would like to point out three things. </p>\n\n<p>First, that there are very real historical reasons why various of these things were a good idea at first. For instance, yes, today it sounds pretty ridiculous that an Egyptian national who was born in Egyp and has never fled any conflict in their or their parents&#39; lifetime can be a Palestine refugee, but in the international and Israeli legal climate of the 1950s and 1960s, it made perfect sense. Reviewing them under contemporary conditions is difficult because, UNRWA&#39;s politics aside, there really are a great number of people that <em>actively</em> need UNRWA aid, and it&#39;s hard to revise the UNRWA&#39;s status in a way that doesn&#39;t hurt them.</p>\n\n<p>Second, though, and as a consequence of that, it&#39;s certainly not just Israeli media that has a problem with this. It has led to very real friction with other parties, including, for instance, refugee groups from countries other than Palestine in the last decades. </p>\n\n<p>And finally, that this has shit all to do with the right of return, which has a completely different legal basis (UNGA Resolution 194) that precedes the establishment of the UNRWA. UNRWA statistics are occasionally brought up along with that but it&#39;s primarily a rhetorical device.</p>\n</div>",
