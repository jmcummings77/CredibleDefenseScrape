      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

But there aren\u2019t any provisions in the law that would allow such a step and Turkey didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n>Sweden argues that, by having the new terrorism law in place, it fulfilled all its obligations under the agreement, and says it has a mutual interest with Turkey in coordinating efforts against terrorism and organized crime more closely. \n\n>The Swedish government on Monday announced a formal decision to extradite a man who claimed to be a supporter of the Kurdish PKK group, while a prosecutor in Stockholm last week brought the first-ever charges related to raising funds for the group.\n\n>When Finland joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in April, Sweden was left in limbo over its prospects, with both Turkey and Hungary\u2019s ratifications outstanding.\n\n>NATO allies are urging Turkey to approve Sweden\u2019s bid in time for the summit, saying the country meets all qualifications. Sweden\u2019s accession would clinch NATO\u2019s control of the Baltic Sea and give the alliance the upper hand in the Arctic region \u2014 both strategic gateways for Russia \u2014 even as Moscow is bogged down in its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n>In the meantime, as a formal invitee, Sweden has a right to join all NATO meetings, in contrast to Ukraine and Georgia, whose applications have yet to move forward in any meaningful way. \n\n>Bringing Sweden into the fold would simplify defense planning for the alliance. NATO would benefit not just from Sweden\u2019s combat aircraft, naval prowess and other military assets but also being able to easily shuttle troops or equipment across Nordic territory. \n\n>But before Sweden can join, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who extended his presidency into a third decade after winning last month\u2019s elections, may need to balance a tough approach with getting US congressional support for Turkey\u2019s purchase of American-made F-16 fighter jets. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a call last week discussed Sweden\u2019s membership and the F-16 sale, which remains in limbo.\n\n>The terrorism-financing charges were filed in Sweden on Friday against a man who allegedly sought to extort money on behalf of the PKK in January this year. He is accused of attempted extortion, attempted terrorism financing and illegal firearm possession. The preliminary investigation reveals his expressions of support for the PKK as well as his association with an alleged prominent figure in the group\u2019s campaigns to raise funds from Kurds in Europe.\n\n>Hungary is expected to back Sweden\u2019s membership as soon as Turkey signals it plans to do so, as the country did with Finland\u2019s application.",

India is not only getting cheaper crude for its own use, their refineries are exporting to Europe.

The war is more likely to end a lot sooner than sanctions/oil caps are likely to be removed. This arbitrage will be available to India for quite some time. Additionally, it's not just about the dollar amount India earns, it's also the fact that it's becoming the supplier of last resort for Europe. \n\n> But this crude trade anomaly is hardly sustainable nor is it that big to make really a big dent in terms of India increasing its heft.\n\nWould urge that all defense alliances and agreements across the world be relooked at with fresh eyes post-invasion. In other words, it's not what NATO was or is, it's what it will be. It's not about what the quad was or is, it's what it could be. Further, the intelligence sharing aspect that India has been gaining is notsomething that's going to be publicized or talked about openly. Has this increased since the war? Honestly, Idk, but it's hard not to imagine that the U.S. and Australia haven't taken a more proactive role to information sharing when it comes to China and Russia, with India. \n\n>I could name big downsides to India like its many weapons systems being Soviet/Russian - I think I saw numbers like 70+% being Russian\n\nWe've all been reading articles for over a decade from anonymous retired Indian officials that India has been making a giant strategic mistake by being so reliant on Russia. If war was ever to break out with China, chances are greater than lower that Russia would have turned neutral and stalled supporting India in-full.

You're right. India cannot afford to make that shift overnight. However, what India is doing, and what the West has recognized it needs to aid India with, is getting the knowledge-share on manufacturing.

The nonlethal fleet is vital because tanks, rocket launchers and infantry fighting vehicles demand vast amounts of support in blasting their way forward.\r  \nThe equipment includes everything from mobile fuel and water tanks and medical and maintenance trucks to unusual vehicles that install portable bridges or clear minefields. They carry ammunition, food, spare parts and the heavy-duty lubricants that lumbering blast-resistant equipment demands.\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for civilians to imagine the amount of support needed\u201d for a mobile attack force, said retired Brig. Gen. Peter \u201cDuke\u201d DeLuca, who served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He likens the \u201cmenagerie of equipment\u201d to Noah\u2019s Ark because, unlike armadas of identical weaponry, it is a collection of oddball vehicles used in small numbers.\r  \nAlready one of the vehicles, a German Bergepanzer 2 Armored Recovery Vehicle, successfully recovered a damaged Leopard 2 tank from the battlefield last week, said a Ukrainian tank mechanic.\r  \nSeparately, images released by Russia showed a damaged Bergepanzer in a minefield alongside three abandoned Leopard 2s and other Ukrainian vehicles, apparently disabled by explosions.\r  \nFor more than a year, Kyiv\u2019s Western allies have been supplying it with heavy military equipment including battle tanks, field cannons, combat vehicles and troop carriers. Less noted on lists of equipment supplied are items such as the eight logistics support vehicles, 18 armored bridging systems and 54 tactical vehicles to recover equipment that the U.S. has given Ukraine.\r  \nThe equipment, used for what is known as combat engineering, enablement and sustainment, is vital to every element of Ukraine\u2019s offensive. Kyiv\u2019s troops are attacking Russian defensive lines that include trenches, aboveground obstacles and minefields.\r  \n\u201cThe next stage is to penetrate\u2014to push through these defensive lines, which they have been building for months,\u201d North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said recently, noting that Ukraine\u2019s attack requires more than tanks and combat vehicles. Troops also need highly specialized battlefield-engineering equipment \u201cto allow the battle tanks to operate,\u201d he said.\r  \nAlongside 14 Challenger 2 tanks that the U.K. gave Ukraine, for example, London also supplied two Challenger Armored Repair and Recovery Vehicles, which are essentially combat-ready mobile repair stations. The modified tank\u2014with a crane, winch and dozer blade but no turret\u2014can carry a replacement Challenger engine and transmission, plus the team of mechanics needed for a battlefield pit-stop.\r  \nThe equipment is crucial because, in an offensive like the one Ukraine is attempting, speed is a key to success. If Kyiv\u2019s troops break through Russian lines, they will want to race as many reinforcements across as possible, to get behind the defenders and advance before Moscow can mobilize a counterattack. \r  \n\u201cHow you generate tempo and operational reach is a function of logistics,\u201d said Benjamin Jensen, a professor of strategic studies at the School of Advanced Warfighting in the Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va.\r  \nUkraine\u2019s offensive is particularly challenging because across much of the front line its troops must advance on open ground, without aircraft supporting them and under Russian surveillance. If they reach obstacles, support equipment becomes as critical as ammunition. \r  \nRussian minefields have already stymied at least one Ukrainian attack. Kyiv has received tanks and other armored vehicles with special attachments and other systems to explode land mines without exposing soldiers to excessive danger, but even they have been disabled by mines in some places, battlefield photos indicate.\r  \nIn many places, Russian troops have dug trenches too wide for tanks to cross, so the armored bridging systems or combat bulldozers will need to make the tank traps crossable by spanning or leveling sections. The bulldozers can also push aside emplaced obstacles, especially if they haven\u2019t been anchored into the ground, as many of Russia\u2019s so-called dragon\u2019s teeth seem not to have been, according to open-source intelligence.\r  \n\u201cCombat engineering equipment will be critical in breaching Russian defenses,\u201d said Ben Barry, a former British tank commander who is now a land-warfare specialist with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\r  \nA frontal assault can take days or even weeks, during which troops need fuel and ammunition resupplies. \r  \n\u201cA battle tank doesn\u2019t drive to the\u2026station for fuel,\u201d said NATO\u2019s Stoltenberg. Instead, the fuel station \u201chas to drive to the battle tank.\u201d \r  \nThe U.S. has given Ukraine 89 heavy fuel tankers, 105 fuel trailers and 30 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicles, which resemble a tank without a gun and zip about a battlefield distributing rounds. \r  \nIf Ukrainians break through Russian defenses, new challenges await. Russia\u2019s rear areas will likely have been cleared of civilian populations, so Ukrainian troops can\u2019t count on finding local provisions to resupply. Even drinking water may not be available.\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to bring in everything you need,\u201d said DeLuca, the Corps of Engineers veteran. \r  \nEven Ukraine\u2019s dream scenario\u2014sending Russian troops fleeing, as they did in the Kharkiv region late last summer\u2014raises logistical challenges. Tanks and other heavy weapons consume enormous amounts of fuel. Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv push last year faded in part because the troops outran their supplies. \r  \n\r  \nSupply problems can also plague strong, winning forces. In 1944, after the Allied invasion of Normandy, U.S. Army Gen. George S. Patton\u2019s troops had to halt after racing more than 700 miles in weeks, partly because they had outraced supply lines.\r  \nSuccessful supply operations, on the other hand, raise a challenge familiar to civilians: traffic. A massive assault entails full supply vehicles heading toward combatants and empty ones returning, often through choke points such as bridges or cleared paths through minefields. \r  \nIn the 1970 film \u201cPatton,\u201d the general leaps from his jeep to de-snarl a tank gridlock. In fact, he sacrificed combat troops to direct vehicles, said DeLuca, because keeping vehicles moving was so complicated and critical.\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s like a plague of locusts or you\u2019d just kicked an anthill, with traffic going everywhere,\u201d said DeLuca of a big campaign\u2019s logistics.\r  \nThe logistical equipment supplied by Washington and its allies shows that they are working to enable an offensive of some scale, he said, though the biggest hurdle lies in its execution on the battlefield.\r  \n\u201cNo one should underestimate the task ahead of the Ukrainians,\u201d DeLuca said.",

Funny enough they thought the same thing before Kherson. Luckily they have enough reserves this time that they can screw up a bunch more times before it becomes a problem. Though I&#39;m hoping they don&#39;t get impatient and just throw troops at the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Not a hit on them, many countries in history including the US biffed an offensive or three by underestimating an enemy with an overly audacious plan that... didn&#39;t exactly mesh with reality. I&#39;m sure the UAF can recover, hopefully they learn their lesson. </p>\n\n<p>I definitely agree about your comment about Russian ability to conduct retrograde ops. They are some of the hardest to conduct and it&#39;s not bullshit to suggest they&#39;ve done that part pretty damn well, all things considered. Luckily for the Ukrainians they are better going backwards than forwards.</p>\n</div>",

The fact of the matter is that you cannot spend precious military resources extravagantly. </p>\n\n<p>Frankly we have a lot of precedent for this in history. And terror bombing is NOT effective.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: it should be noted that in a large amount of cases when you shoot down a missile, the warhead still explodes on the ground. Which usually is in a civilian area. If a missile gets shot down over kyiv, it is almost 100% of the time landing in a civilian area and exploding.</p>\n</div>",

Sure, they've done it a few times for good reasons like to hold key terrain to stall a Ukraine advance or cover a retreat, and a few bad reasons like when senior brass and even Putin supposedly intervened and refused subordinate commanders' request to retreat. \n\nInstead they prefer to use what is called [maneuver defense](https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/eARMOR/content/issues/2021/Spring/2Grau_Bartles21.pdf), defined as \"a tactical and operational form of defense whose goal is to inflict \r\nenemy casualties, gain time and preserve friendly forces with the potential loss of territory.\" A key trigger for retreating during a maneuver defense is when the unit fears it is about to be decisively engaged, ergo, fixed by fires, outflanked, or assaulted. The point is to hit and move. And counterattack at every opportunity to take advantage of enemy unbalance once they capture a position.\n\nIf they are allowed to perform maneuver defense, this largely explains the significant operational depth of the Russian defensive lines. They aren't waiting for the front lines to near collapse before they work on fall back positions, they intend to lose part of their defensive positions and it's part of the plan. A maneuver defense isn't focused on holding all ground but only what is truly militarily important, and even then that's still sacrificial. It's instead focused on preserving combat power while weakening/exhausting the attacker. Overall the idea is to defend with mobility, to NOT remain static. Move backwards to pull the attacker in, then slingshot forward to retake lost ground.\n\nThe Ukrainians share the same doctrine because they and the Russians have the same background, with the operational concept stemming from the Soviet time period, and with all senior 3-4 star generals all being Soviet trained originally (some more than others, Colonel General Syrsky was a Soviet major when the Cold War ended). However, due to a mix of political interference and desire to pursue aggressive attritional warfare, by and large the UAF were not allowed to perform a maneuver defense, especially at the operational level, and often not at the tactical level either where senior 2-3 star generals were sometimes literally dictating whether or not platoons were allowed to retreat.\n\nAdditionally, if you look at the maps of Russian fortifications, their most in-depth defensive lines are far from the front lines. This is because they needed to be outside of UAF arty range to construct them, which involved using specialized engineering vehicles, manual labor, lots of engineering support to include pouring concrete, etc, and they couldn't do that at the existing front lines because the Ukrainians would interfere. \n\nWhile the existing Russian front line along the \"line of contact\" weren't an actual outpost line, like an old sketch of a WW1 German elastic defense position (meant to be lost with minimal fighting over them), they were definitely more vulnerable than the main lines of resistance that are meant to be held (which are also based in pretty significant tactical depth). Less mines, less other obstacles, less heavily defended trench works and bunkers, etc.\n\nAll told, the use of maneuver defense as doctrine, and if the Russians are actually following it (it looks like they are) should mean we should expect the Russians to retreat. And frequently counterattack. And we should expect the Ukrainians to be able to advance unless something went horribly wrong.\n\nI'm not writing this to explain away Ukraine success so far, but assuming maneuver defense is used then this campaign definitely shouldn't look like past campaigns where the Ukrainians were on the defense. Nor even Russian defenses like the Kherson bridgehead where the local situation meant maneuver defense was much more difficult to impossible. It needs to be viewed in the context of the operational schemes of both the attacker AND the defender.",

Overall I think Russia intends to win this war by an attrition/exhaustion strategy.\n\nThe constant attacks on the cities and power grid with strategic attacks with long range PGMs is definitely an exhaustion strategy. Not only do they want to hurt morale but they are also causing further strife to the UA economy, enlarging the exodus of refugees. \n\nRussian brass and the milbloggers have often promoted an attrition strategy to destroy the UAF. They've not been successful but they're definitely hurt then, especially compared to what they were like before the war started.\n\nThe winter offensive that Gerasimov launched seems stupid unless one considers that his other choice was to do nothing for 4-5 months and let every UAF rest, refit, and prepare for the offensive. Instead, at a cost that was heavy but mostly Wagner scum, they tied up and attrited a significant amount of the Ukrainians who are now not themselves ready to go on the general offensive, leaving only a limited number that are offensively capable for a summer offensive. Plus, every day the Ukrainians didn't need to fight meant another few thousand rounds of artillery they didn't need to fire and instead could stockpile for the coming offensive. \n\nThere are supposedly nine new UAF brigades, nine Nat'l Guard Offensive Guard brigades, and however many existing brigades had been rotated to the rear of be used. That amounts to ~3x full corps. That's HUGE. If they mass those corps then the Russians have little hope to stop them cold, the ratios are too large. But they don't need to stop them cold because there is little valuable in the immediate area of any place they need to defend, they have the benefit of using depth to defend. \n\nWith depth, and a desire to attrit the Ukrainians, they are in a good position to use this offensive to try to weaken those 3x UA offensively capable corps. If they can do that, then the UA CAN'T retake their country, which means the war ends with a settlement. In theory. It might not work, but it's a feasible strategy to end the war.\n\n>They want to hold it and take more... giving up ground, even if just a few hundred meters at a time, seems counter productive.\n\nThat's the political take, when territory is more important than anything. Then the question begs, why? Usually it's about feelings of morale, public relations and propaganda, and little else. There is a time and place for \"hold at all cost\" defenses, usually to protect a vulnerable or key position that is vital to the tactical, operational, or strategic plan. Or to cover a retreat. Prevent a breakthrough until forces behind can rally. Etc. But not all the time, when its all the time it's political. Period. Militarily, and it's been this way forever, defenders don't and shouldn't try to hold everything, as it puts them in a bad position. Essentially it sets them up for failure, not only heavy losses but an impossible mission that they can't succeed.\n\nIf Putin is micromanaging and demands every meter held, the Russians are going to lose this campaign, badly. If they turn it over to the military commanders who understand operational theory, they can preserve territory while significantly weakening the Ukrainians. Yes, they'll lose some ground but it could potentially end the war, assuming the Ukrainians don't make big enough gains to impress Western leaders to keep doing what they did in 2022-23 forever. \n\nIt's not a great strategy, but it's a strategy.\n\n>One being timing and two being the availability of armored vehicles for falling back then a counter offensive.\n\nCounterattacks, not counteroffensives. A counteroffensive would be something like a major attack at the end of the Ukrainian offensive after they ran out of steam (assuming that happens). A counterattack is the Ukrainians take a village, then the Russians send reserves to attack that lost position within a few hours of it happening, made easier because they were already planning to do that because maneuver defense calls for that to happen, the reserve units are already staged, the arty prep fires know exactly where to aim (they're firing at their old positions), etc. Even with strict orders process/directive command style, they can still do that if it's preplanned.\n\nAnd Russia has armored vehicles, though they don't need them to retreat anymore than the Ukrainians did in the past, who often conducted retreats in commandeered civilian vehicles or on foot. \n\n>Perhaps these first few layers of defenses are just mobiks who are basically lambs for the slaughter?\n\nThey're not supposed to die in place, so they're not lambs to the slaughter. Hold their pretty well constructed and protected positions until the position is untenable and then retreat to the next prepared position. \n\nLambs to the slaughter in defensive ops typically means outgunned, outnumbered troops stuck in a position they can't defend with no other alternatives. Think Romanians in Operation Uranus. That doesn't seem at all like what's happening now, at least not from what I've heard of.\n\n>If a nation only trains for one type of defense, when their backs are against the wall and they have no more defensive lines to retreat to, then what? \n\nAsk the Ukrainians, who built more defenses after the forward one were broken through. Like [Bakhmut](https://archive.is/KWqfX/1034b9d7911d4a7db128e77e227080ea5835d1a6.webp), look how much the lines shifted, each advance triggering the construction of defenses behind despite a \"hold at all cost\" positional defense policy. \n\nIn the South, the Russians have 3x operational level lines, the existing front lines and two more belts behind, with each often tactically aligned in depth too. If the first is fully broken through, before the second is they can already start working on a forth and finish it before the third is even engaged.",

The goal is to have most of the drone's components to be locally produced (except for chipsets) by end of next year.\n\n> Production of munitions is a painful issue in Ukraine because of the lack of laws/outdated Soviet laws. For example, private companies currently can't produce munitions. This issue expands to other production as well, and it's visible by the lack of Western companies willing to invest in local production in Ukraine.\n\n> Drones need to evolve every 6 months, otherwise, they become outdated. This is why a lot of drones in Ukraine are classified as \"fit for military use\" and not \"in military service\" (meaning the government can place large orders for it). Achieving the latter status takes 2+ years which is incompatible with drone development speed.\n\n> New R-34 drone will carry up to 20kg of munitions, compared to 5kg on R-18.\n\n> R-34 is cross-compatible with R-18 ground command centers and controls. R-18 drones can even be upgraded to R-34.\n\n> R-34 drones have penetrated 50mm armor in testing.\n\n> Ukraine currently can't match Russia in terms of damage dealt by drones like Lancet/Shahed-136. This will hopefully change with time, as Ukrainian development speed is much faster than Russia's.\n\n> There are around 50 mid-level companies producing drones and a lot of smaller companies.\n\n> Ministry of Digital Transformation is a good example of civilian collaboration with the government. They are quick to react to companies' requests and believe that change can happen. A good example of this is Brave-1, a new government-sponsored mil-tech innovation platform.",

Then, later on, when partial mobilization was (finally) called, I think everyone familiar with the old Soviet mobilization system was surprised at how *slow* it was this time. No one expected you'd walk into the barracks and find your backpack with your name on it on the bed anymore, but it was certainly surprising to see how much of the Soviet mobilization system had been dismantled. Western observers mistook it for lack of proper support, fear of loss of public support, or incompetence, but much of it really was by design and... just not as good as expected, or not as good as it had been portrayed.\n\nLots of this may not be due to Gerasimov being incompetent -- in fact, I very much doubt that's the case, and Gerasimov would certainly not be the first Russian military commander whose sound ideas end up poorly implemented. But IMHO it's certainly the case that the position of the Russian army *is* constrained now. Mounting a better defense of Zaporizhzhia, south Kherson and the Donbas was one of the main selling points of the retreat from Kherson, so further territorial losses are unlikely to be seen in a positive light upstairs. Retreating from untenable, overstretched positions is one thing, but retreating from well-prepared defenses is less likely to fly IMHO.\n\nI think this latter point is actually the interesting one. As you've pointed out, lots of Ryan's work is so partisan that it's hard to trust it at times, but the part about the constraints Gerasimov is facing in the planning of his defense isn't at all unrealistic IMHO.",

Some settlements have already been captured with seemingly minimal Russian resistance, other settlements have been captured with limited Russian resistance. The Russians have and are conducting local counterattacks to reclaim key settlements. The one to watch out for right now is Staromlynivka. Capturing this would allow Ukrainians to gain a nice staging point for further attacks down this axis. Both the Ukranians and Russians recognize the strategic implications of these towns. This is also as I predicted.\n\nThe question is whether Ukraine ever resumes their attacks down the Tokmak axis, and I don't think they will for some time. It seems increasingly likely Tokmak is a nice but secondary objective.\n\nThere are an incredible amount of variables that makes the outcome of this push impossible to predict at this point, both good and bad for both sides. For example: Russians are probably transferring a lot of strength from the Kherson region to the Zaporozhye region. As Ukranians advance, the Russian line will shorten and density on the front line will increase. The Ukranians could introduce another axis in the Luhansk direction(they have not committed the majority of their force).

Whereas shallow defences have the risk that penetration at one point causes the surrounding of the entire front by the enemy through maneuvre, defence-in-depth hedges against this by forcing any enemy maneuvre element to penetrate all lines in one fell swoop to break through. Otherwise, it gets stuck in between some of the lines. Defenders can then react to this by either counterattacking or retreating.\n\nThat said, defence-in-depth is not unbeatable. There are multiple ways to respond to such a strategy as an attacker:\n\n1. Have a strong enough thrust that you penetrate all lines at the same time. While a very costly strategy, it is a strategy.\n\n2. Bite-and-hold tactics. Basically, take only part of initial lines, and attempt to repel the coming counterattack. If successful, this makes the enemy line less deep for future attacks, and future breakthroughs more viable.\n\n3. Attempt to force the enemy to deploy all their reserves. If all reserves are deployed, there are no forces available for a counterattack, which makes defensive lines more vulnerable to both bite-and-hold tactics as well as penetration.\n\nI believe Ukraine is using some mix of 2 and 3 for now, waiting to use point 1 for later. A lot of shallow incursions along the front, which require Russia to counterattack everywhere (which requires deploying reserves) in which ground was lost or allow their defensive depth to slowly deteriorate. Whatever Russia decides, if done right, Ukraine deteriorates Russia's capability to perform defense-in depth.\n\nThe notion that Ukraine only penetrated unimportant defensive lines is just untrue.

It allows for mobility in the defense, both as a way of absorbing blows, preserving forces at the expense of holding ground, and to keep the initiative, not letting the enemy dictate the pace and will of the fight but being allowed to make proactive decisions.\n\nIn certain situations, defensive units that have already retreated would be tasked with the counterattack, while in other situations its uncommitted tactical reserves that were already set aside that are called up for that purpose. It really depends. And counterattacks are typically inherently easier to perform than a standard attack, as they often come with surprise, the opponent is not in a defensive posture themselves or is an unknown/compromised one, and the counterattacking force usually has some sort of tricks, like knowing gaps in obstacles, where concealed avenues of approaches are located, the exact location of every key terrain feature to include their own lost positions (which they can hit with fires).\n\nWhen it comes to reserves, maneuver defense  calls for them, lots actually. For example, the long term use of \"two up, one back\" doctrine for ground forces means that at nearly every level 1/3 of a unit conducting a defense aren't even defending, they're either waiting to plug a gap or to counterattack. At the tactical level, a significant portion of the unit holding the line should have reserves, and then at the operational level (controlling the overall sector that an offensive axis is driving on) should have mobile, competent units (such as the VDV, which have been tapped for those roles in the past).\n\nAnd that is to say that legit reserves are even needed. In WW2, the Germans used to regularly and successfully launch counterattacks with literally anyone capable of holding a rifle. By 1944 it was dictated as a standing order that counterattacks would be automatic if losing ground, which meant surviving battalion officers regularly rounded up everyone in the immediate vicinity of the battalion HQ, so support personnel along with whatever retreating units they could find, coordinated a quick plan to get some supporting fires, and then counterattacked. And it OFTEN worked, because counterattacks that occur immediately after an attacking force takes an objective can be extremely effective unless the attacking force was prepared for receiving those counterattacks. And when I mean prepared, I mean EVERYONE automatically starts prepping immediately as soon as the objective is taken, a skill that only professional militaries with high discipline and LOTS of unit training are able to achieve.\n\nEven with a positional defense is there a need to counterattack. So someone up high decides a hill with a commanding view or a fording area on a water obstacle needs to be held at all cost. And the defending unit does a splendid job holding it at costs until they suffer over 50% casualties and are forced to retreat in a near rout after being outflanked and their supply lines nearly cut. Guess what typically happens next? Likely a counterattack with whatever is available, to include rounding up troops who just retreated as they are the closest, they know the position, and at the end of the day a combatant's life isn't much more precision than a bullet or artillery shell. \n\nThe boxing analogy doesn't work well for positional defense because that would be a boxer who steps into the center of the ring and isn't leaving that area no matter what, so getting punched in the face 50 times is less important than holding the center of the ring. Using the boxing analogy, maneuver defense would be the boxer ignoring where in the ring they fight, focusing on not getting their ass kicked while hurting their opponent as much a possible. They retreat when it suits them, they advance when they suit them, there is nothing important in that ring worth planting their feet and remaining immobile.

Even in WW2 Eastern front, something that we could call maneuver defense was done in really small sections of the front and only in specific situations. The majority of the front was literally static positions that had to be conquered one after the other.  </p>\n\n<p>I think that the Russians are using defense in depth plus static positions plus maneuver defense where specific units have specific tasks within these three methods of defense. So, you can have both static positions with units that are not of the best capabilities and also units that are capable.   </p>\n\n<p>Also, I am a bit skeptical of the idea that movement of larger formations is that complex in terms of the actions that the specific grunts on the ground have to do.

Like, he propelled himself to notability on here primarily for saying &quot;oh wow look how horrible the Russian army is doing&quot;... and he doesn&#39;t actually know how badly or well the Russian army is doing?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d have to read more of his recent stuff (so that&#39;s a disclaimer right there, maybe he&#39;s gotten better, but the Prigozhin fanfics make me think otherwise), but as an example from the article above - he claims that Ukrainians are using excalibur heavily on tactical targets in the Urozhaine direction.  How in the world would he know that?  How would the Russians determine that and communicate it to him while in the middle of a fighting withdrawal?</p>\n\n<p>So at best he&#39;s an on-paper analyst trying to read the same data that we&#39;re getting and making conclusions.  And maybe his analysis on this offensive will age better but he&#39;s previously not impressed me.</p>\n</div>",

In order for someone to be granted approval following the implementation of this rule, a user would have to make a credible subreddit level thread with some analysis which contributes significantly to the quality of the discussion (essentially it's up to the mods to make the judgment).\n\nI am suggesting this because I understand how much time and effort it takes to mod these threads and I'm worried that this sub will turn into r/geopolitics over time due to the influx of new people which becomes uncontrollable.\n\nThis is a solution that was once implemented at r/badeconomics and was called \"The Wumbo Wall\" if the mods want to look for good examples of the implementation of this option. The outcome in that case was an increase in quality subreddit level submissions and a significant reduction of low quality comments.\n\nI've been following these threads for the last 400 days and contributing infrequently, and I support implementing the nuclear option even if I don't get the commenting rights myself.

You know as a community we&#39;ve taken it too far when even <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1447blr/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_08_2023/jned3c8/\">Glideer is coming out to calm the doomposting</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re also aware that there may be a large influx of users as the rest of reddit goes into blackout, so these rules may revert back tomorrow.</p>\n</div>",
