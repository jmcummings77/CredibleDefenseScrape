It's rather curious that every single commentator says UAF has broken through and taken villages, and that there isn't a single claimed taken village in the whole sector that someone isn't claiming they have verified information that it hasn't been taken at all.  \n\nBoth sides assert truly spectacular losses upon the enemy, but there's very little in the way of images or confirmation, except that if Ukrainian casualties were even close to the more expansive Russian claims, there would be a traffic jam of ambulances all the back to Mykolaiv.  \n\nI stand by my belief that UAF has broken through the Front line of fortified positions in several positions. I also find the evidence compelling that UAF forces have aggressively extended cross country between Russian held positions to further constrain such supply efforts as the Russians may muster for forward positions.\n\nMy interpretation is that we won't see another active push by UAF for the rest of the week, as greatest gains can be met by returning to the bear hug tactics up and down the line, combined with yet more aggressive interdiction of supply. \n\nLogistics is 80% of the battle now. It is clear that Russia is expending munitions at an unsustainable rate, and though a process of constant contact and aggressive recon is costly to Ukrainian forces, forcing Russia to continue expending into the deficit is crucial.  The flip side of the coin, is whether the Ukraine has gathered sufficient reserves in men and munitions to continue these tactics until  they succeed, and have the intestinal fortitude for the losses and casualties such tactics will generate in the short term. \n\nOther things I am looking for: \n\nAggressive counter battery fire. Looking at the FIRMS map, Militaryland's tracking of artillery strikes and DefMon's fires tracker, Russian artillery in the north of the front is running out of room to shoot and scoot, without cheating into sectors under counter fire from the west. I assume the Russians are giving as good as they get,  but the Ukrainian artillery isn't so constrained and has a range advantage. I wonder how many tubes Russia has on the west bank: Their defense lives and dies by artillery fires.\n\nSecond, I wonder about Kherson. There's several vids out of Kherson which show very little, but the sound of significant small arms fire can be heard. There's a number of possibilities: UAF has elements or recon elements into the suburbs, Russians are accidentally engaging in Red on Red firefights, many Russians are trying to shoot down drones, or some Chechens are filming a TicToc video.  \n\nIt's obvious that partisan forces in the city have upped their game, and every day they become more aggressive. It makes equal sense that Ukrainian SOFs are already in the city, but in token numbers or more?  Hard to say.\n\nAnyway, I encourage everyone to relax, sit back and watch the war.  I'm going to church after work today to light a candle, and I made a supplemental payment to Doctors Without Borders, my chosen charity for medical care in theater.  Thoughts, prayers and a few dollars are all we have to offer.",

Evidence from Eighteen Countries Get*\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqac047\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/66/3/sqac047/6679368?redirectedFrom=fulltext\n\nAbstract:\n\nDo armed drone programs decrease or increase terrorism? Existing studies on this question produce conflicting arguments and evidence. Drone optimists contend that armed drones reduce a country's vulnerability to terrorism, while pessimists claim that this military technology provokes higher levels of terrorism. Prior research focuses almost exclusively on one particular context: the short-term effect of the US drone program in Pakistan. However, armed drones have proliferated rapidly over the last decade and eighteen countries now possess this technology. We expand the scope of prior studies by leveraging new data to assess how obtaining armed drones and conducting drone strikes changed the degree to which all drone possessors experienced terrorism between 2001 and 2019. Employing a variety of estimation strategies, including two-way fixed effects, we find that armed drone programs are associated with significant reductions in terrorism. Our analysis, based on the full universe of cases over an eighteen-year period, provides further evidence that drones can be effective as a counterterrorism tool in some cases.\n\n-------------\n\nThis study was submitted here 12 days ago, in a preview written by the authors.

Existing studies on this question produce conflicting arguments and evidence. Drone optimists contend that armed drones reduce a country&#39;s vulnerability to terrorism, while pessimists claim that this military technology provokes higher levels of terrorism. Prior research focuses almost exclusively on one particular context: the short-term effect of the US drone program in Pakistan. However, armed drones have proliferated rapidly over the last decade and eighteen countries now possess this technology. We expand the scope of prior studies by leveraging new data to assess how obtaining armed drones and conducting drone strikes changed the degree to which all drone possessors experienced terrorism between 2001 and 2019. Employing a variety of estimation strategies, including two-way fixed effects, we find that armed drone programs are associated with significant reductions in terrorism. Our analysis, based on the full universe of cases over an eighteen-year period, provides further evidence that drones can be effective as a counterterrorism tool in some cases.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>This study was submitted here 12 days ago, in a preview written by the authors.

But it never will either, a country as big as Russia, who has high tensions with numerous neighbors, cant just tie down it&#39;s entire military in Ukraine. So that pro-Russian line that &quot;Russia isn&#39;t even trying yet&quot; is still bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure who he intended that message to be for, though. The leadership in the west and Ukraine are already well aware of Russia&#39;s full capabilities, and honestly who cares if some random people on reddit and twitter underestimate Russia&#39;s capability.</p>\n</div>",
