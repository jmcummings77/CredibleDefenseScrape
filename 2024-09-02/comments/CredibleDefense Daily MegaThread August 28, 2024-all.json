It is about 60km from Singu town, which has been under the control of Mandalay PDF since late July, and around 80km from the ruby hub of Mogoke.\n\n>A NUG\u2019s defense ministry statement on Monday said that Thabeikkyin fell on August 19 after junta troops retreated to the Myo Oo Taung hilltop pagoda above the town, which they held until Sunday.\n\n>More than 70 bombs have been dropped on Thabeikkyin by junta fighter jets and there have been separate attacks by Y-12 aircraft and Mi-35 helicopters, the ministry added.\n\n>Resistance groups seized thousands of bullets, 42 bombs, 36 rocket-propelled grenade rounds, three jammers and one communication device, it said.\n\n>Lieutenant Colonel Soe Min Thu, the junta\u2019s district administrative chief, was detained under international law, the ministry stated.\n\nFun fact! Thabeikkyin was rumored to be home to elements of a [secret nuclear program](https://web.archive.org/web/20100818195729/http://www.dvb.no/news/expert-says-burma-%E2%80%98planning-nuclear-bomb%E2%80%99/9527) in the past. Evidently, nothing came of that.\n\nThe NUG is getting bold, aiming to [Liberate District in Southern Mandalay](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/war-against-the-junta/myanmars-civilian-government-aims-to-liberate-district-in-southern-mandalay.html)\n\n>Clashes between People\u2019s Defence Forces (PDFs) under the control of the National Unity Government (NUG) and other resistance forces escalated in Myingyan, a southern district of Mandalay Region, on Monday, resistance groups said.\n\n>On Monday morning, PDFs in Myingyan District seized a police outpost where junta troops were stationed in the township\u2019s Nga Myar village tract.\n\n>Allied resistance groups also captured junta troops at an outpost in the village tract on the banks of the Irrawaddy River, about five miles from Si Mee Kho port of Myingyan town, a spokesperson for Ngazun PDF said.\n\n>\u201cWe are still taking control of Nga Myar village tract and the fighting keeps escalating. We are trying to seize it completely,\u201d he said.\n\n>Nga Myar is the biggest village tract in Ngazun Township, with a population of about 7,000 people. It is also home to pro-military Pyu Saw Htee militia groups, an official from the NUG\u2019s Ministry of Defense said.\n\n>He said that the PDFs are attacking Pyu Saw Htee militia bases in Ngazun Township and that these attacks are part of the ministry\u2019s Myingyan District Special Operation.\n\n>The operation is the first of its kind. Its goal is to liberate all four townships of Myingyan District \u2013 Myingyan, Taung Tha, Natogyi and Nganzun \u2013 from junta troops and their allied militias.\n\n>Many rural areas of the district have been under resistance control for years with the junta\u2019s administration restricted to towns, residents say.\n\nThe NUG is taking the war to the towns now. For almost all of their insurgency they could not hold large settlements. The situation has now changed.\n\nThe Arakan Army continues their offensive in Rakhine, entering [Gwa](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/war-against-the-junta/fighting-flares-in-gwa-southernmost-township-in-myanmars-rakhine-state.html), the state's southernmost township.\n\n>Clashes between the Myanmar junta\u2019s military and the Arakan Army (AA) have been reported in multiple locations around Gwa Township, the strategic southernmost township in Rakhine State, since Sunday, according to residents.\n\n>The AA, a member of the Brotherhood Alliance of three ethnic armies, has advanced to a location approximately 32 km to the north of Gwa town after seizing Kyeintali town in Thandwe District on Aug. 14, and fighting has broken out in at least at four areas in the township.\n\nI think it is possible that the AA will take control over all of Rakhine this year.",

It is about 60km from Singu town, which has been under the control of Mandalay PDF since late July, and around 80km from the ruby hub of Mogoke.</p>\n\n<p>A NUG\u2019s defense ministry statement on Monday said that Thabeikkyin fell on August 19 after junta troops retreated to the Myo Oo Taung hilltop pagoda above the town, which they held until Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>More than 70 bombs have been dropped on Thabeikkyin by junta fighter jets and there have been separate attacks by Y-12 aircraft and Mi-35 helicopters, the ministry added.</p>\n\n<p>Resistance groups seized thousands of bullets, 42 bombs, 36 rocket-propelled grenade rounds, three jammers and one communication device, it said.</p>\n\n<p>Lieutenant Colonel Soe Min Thu, the junta\u2019s district administrative chief, was detained under international law, the ministry stated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fun fact! Thabeikkyin was rumored to be home to elements of a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100818195729/http://www.dvb.no/news/expert-says-burma-%E2%80%98planning-nuclear-bomb%E2%80%99/9527\">secret nuclear program</a> in the past. Evidently, nothing came of that.</p>\n\n<p>The NUG is getting bold, aiming to <a href=\"https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/war-against-the-junta/myanmars-civilian-government-aims-to-liberate-district-in-southern-mandalay.html\">Liberate District in Southern Mandalay</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clashes between People\u2019s Defence Forces (PDFs) under the control of the National Unity Government (NUG) and other resistance forces escalated in Myingyan, a southern district of Mandalay Region, on Monday, resistance groups said.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday morning, PDFs in Myingyan District seized a police outpost where junta troops were stationed in the township\u2019s Nga Myar village tract.</p>\n\n<p>Allied resistance groups also captured junta troops at an outpost in the village tract on the banks of the Irrawaddy River, about five miles from Si Mee Kho port of Myingyan town, a spokesperson for Ngazun PDF said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are still taking control of Nga Myar village tract and the fighting keeps escalating. We are trying to seize it completely,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Nga Myar is the biggest village tract in Ngazun Township, with a population of about 7,000 people. It is also home to pro-military Pyu Saw Htee militia groups, an official from the NUG\u2019s Ministry of Defense said.</p>\n\n<p>He said that the PDFs are attacking Pyu Saw Htee militia bases in Ngazun Township and that these attacks are part of the ministry\u2019s Myingyan District Special Operation.</p>\n\n<p>The operation is the first of its kind. Its goal is to liberate all four townships of Myingyan District \u2013 Myingyan, Taung Tha, Natogyi and Nganzun \u2013 from junta troops and their allied militias.</p>\n\n<p>Many rural areas of the district have been under resistance control for years with the junta\u2019s administration restricted to towns, residents say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The NUG is taking the war to the towns now.

The war in Ukraine clearly showed the US and its allies are ill prepared to mass produce basic ammunitions like artillery shells let alone long-range missiles which are usually produced at much smaller quantities.

I see no way the US can sustain this war strategy if there's a protracted conflict that lasts for years. A lot of people don't know this but it took the Qing dynasty about 11 attempts to finally conquer Taiwan in the 1600s ( from remnants of Ming dynasty that fled the island). So, even if the US war strategy initially succeeds at defeating invading Chinese forces, the Chinese will not stop but will try again and again.

The PLA is certainly not toasting their imminent victory. At this particular moment in time, the US <em>might</em>, emphasis on <em>might</em>, fail to achieve its political objectives despite inflicting disproportionate casualties. There is far more for the US to be worried about in the medium term, over the next 10-20 years, where the outlook gets increasingly grim. But not now.</p>\n\n<p>If you claimed the US will likely lose in 2035 or 2049, given what we know today, well that&#39;s a different story.</p>\n</div>",
