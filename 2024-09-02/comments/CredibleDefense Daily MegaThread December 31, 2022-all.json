        "body": "ISW reported that ZNPP lost its \"last functioning back-up power line\" on the 29th so I just wanted to add some more context as to what that means. It's a dire situation, but the plant isn't facing immediate risk of loss of power pending other significant disruptions. \n\nThe plant has three 750 kV main power lines connected to a nearby thermal facility, one of which is still online. It additionally has three 330 kV \"back-up\" lines - all three of which are now disabled. \n\nAll six reactors at ZNPP are in cold shutdown, and can be safely cooled with lower coolant pressure (maybe 10% relative to normal operations). This significantly reduces the energy requirements of the reactors, but power is still necessary; the coolant systems still need to operate continuously and the reactors must be monitored. \n\nAny one of the six primary and backup lines to the plant can independently provide sufficient power for this. Being down to one functioning line is a serious redundancy concern, but in the event of full external power loss the plant also has nine back-up diesel generators. These can provide sufficient power to the plant for around 15 days, but that could likely be extended in the event of an emergency. \n\nFull, sustained  loss of power (including the generators) could be catastrophic because fuel gives off decay heat even in cold shutdown. Coolant system operation is necessary to remove this heat, otherwise the fuel and coolant system could overheat leading to fuel damage, loss of coolant, and potentially the release of radioactive material. \n\nThis would be a significant risk over a multi-day loss of power. Note that these VVER reactors are a completely different design than the reactors at Chernobyl, and they have a much more robust containment system. The absolute worst-case scenario would probably look something like Fukushima, but again note that would require sustained loss of all external lines and the diesel generators for multiple days. \n\nIAEA update on the situation from yesterday:\n\nhttps://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-138-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine\n\nSummary of ZNPP's safety systems (by an intern, but well-cited and a good overview):\n\nhttps://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/safety-systems-of-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plants-complex-aasiansari-291222",

You need to respond with professional level infantry, something Russia has lots in great numbers.</p>\n</div>",

Russia is also a trade partner of North Korea while the US isn't. More directly, if they were to align the west there would be a strong case for Reunification since both Koreas claim to desire it which directly threatens the Kim regime.\n- Iran is regularly in conflict with Israel and Saudi Arabia in the Middle east, both of which align with the US and so competes with the US directly. To some extent their interests also conflict with Russian interests but they also often align and now aligning with Russia provides them capability they struggle to attain domestically (like air defense and airframes).\n- Venezuela has been under US sanctions for 15 years and relations have massively deteriorated due to the US' attempts to influence Venezuelan politics. In this case the government supports Russia due to antagonism towards the US, but that antagonism has a solid and continuing basis. Similar reasoning also applies to Cuba, which habitually votes against US interests.\n\nSo the answer is generally that the countries which support Russia either can't benefit from \"_supporting western democracies_\" or they can benefit more from supporting Russia.",

Has Russia's war in Ukraine affected the Assad regime's military strength and position in the Syrian Civil War, and could Israel, Turkey, the SDF, and non-state actors take advantage of this?

                "body": "I haven't seen that infographic. China is stronger due to a massive variety of reasons.\n\nPretty much all Chinese weapons are superior to all American weapons.\n\nThe USAF is still 50% F-16C/Ds, most of which have garbage Pulse-Doppler radars. A few have been outfitted with AESAs (SABR), but most do not. China, on the other hand, has numerous 4.5 gen Flanker clones with powerful AESA radars with huge ranges, such as later J-10 and J-11 variants and J-16s.\n\nThe J-20 is vastly superior to anything fielded by the US. It has a combat radius of 2000 km, compared to 1,093 for the F-22 and 1200-something for the F-35, which is extremely valuable in the Pacific. Its radar is greatly superior to that of the F-35, containing either 1856 or 2,000-2,200 T/R modules compared to just 1,676 for the F-35. The F-22 does have 1,956 TR modules, but it doesn't have an integrated IRST like the F-35 or J-20 (IIRC). It is also kinematically superior to the F-35, which gives its missiles greater energy, enables it to evade missiles better, and get into position more easily. While it has not been produced in the same numbers as the F-35, China's rate of production is constantly accelerating, with ~200 having been built, just in the last few years.\n\nChinese air-to-air missiles are superior to anything the west has. The PL-15 has a range of 200 km, which is greater than the AMRAAM and Meteor and only equalled by the JATM. Once the JATM comes out, China will likely have a better missile. The PL-21 and PL-17 have 300-400+ km ranges, which enable them to destroy western AWACS, tankers, cargo planes, and maritime patrol aircraft (which are all non-stealthy and defenseless) with ease. The west has nothing like these missiles.\n\nChinese infantry have better weapons as well. Each Chinese squad has an HMG and a semiautomatic grenade launcher, which gives them a huge amount of firepower. They used to use the QJZ-89 as their HMG, which weighs just 26 kilograms (including tripod), compared to 58 kilograms for the M2 Browning (with tripod). It is being replaced by the QJZ-171, which weighs just 16.8 kilograms. Their grenade launcher is the QLU-11, which fires high-velocity grenades an is reputed to be very accurate.\n\nChinese tube artillery is superior to American artillery. America currently relies on shitty M109s with L/39 guns and no autoloaders, as well as towed M777s and 105mm guns that are easy prey to counterbattery fire. These all have a very short range and fire very slowly. Chinese 155mm guns are L/52 and most of the SPGs have autoloaders, so they have a very long range and massive rates of fire. China also has towed artillery, but they have more of it than the US. They have more SPGs as well. China also has autoloading 120mm mortars, while the US does not.\n\nChinese rocket artillery is superior to American rocket artillery. China has things like the PHL-16, which can fire guided 370mm rockets with a range of 220 kilometers, which is vastly superior to HIMARS/M270.\n\nChinese anti-tank weapons are superior to American ones. Not only do they have the HJ-12, which is a fire-and-forget, top-attack missile like the Javelin, but they also have the HJ-10, which is an analogue to the Spike NLOS, and which the US has no answer to.\n\nChinese kamikaze drones are also superior to American ones. They have the ASN-301, which has a 200+ km range and can hunt down radiation emitters to perform SEAD. America only has Switchblades and such with a very short range. China also has the CH-901, which can penetrate 100 mm of armor (enough for tank top armor). 48 of them can be launched from a single 6x6 truck.\n\nChina has the PLARF, which the US has no equivalent of. It is equipped with a massive arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles, including short-ranged ones such as the DF-11 and DF-15 to shower on Taiwan, mid-range ones like the DF-21 to bombard Japan, long ranged ones such as the DF-26 to reach Australia, ballistic missiles with terminal seekers to attack ships, things like the hypersonic DF-17 which the US has basically no defense against, etc. The US is not prepared to deal with all of this. China will rain thousands of missiles down on US and allied forces if a war starts, destroying aircraft, command centers, barracks, supply depots, fuel dumps, power stations, water treatment plants, bridges, etc. Bunkers are of little use, as China has bunker busting missiles like the DF-15C which can penetrate 25 meters of hardened concrete. Anything in the open will be destroyed using CJ-10 dropping cluster munitions. America is trying to develop missiles, but the PrSM is still not yet ready, and America\u2019s hypersonic weapons are still in their infancy. And America still has no way to attack hardened Chinese command centers and hangars (China has 40 underground hangars that can hold 1,100 aircraft). The PLARF is not only useful for a massive alpha strike, but can also be used to fire DF-26 at European factories and power plants from Xinjiang to reduce western military production, at ships in the Suez canal to impede western logistics, at Saudi oil wells to deny their oil to Europe, and at Japanese ports and cargo ships to blockade Japan.\n\nChina has a hypersonic reconnaissance drone, the WZ-8. The US has no equivalent.\nChina has a massive maritime militia of fishermen who harass other counties\u2019 fishermen in peacetime and who can detect targets during a war. The US does not.\nThere are many other pieces of equipment that I do not know about. I am not an expert on the Chinese military, after all. But when you look at nearly any type of equipment, you will see that China\u2019s version is either equivalent or better.\nEquipment is not the only things that matters when it comes to war. China is superior in all other areas as well.\n\nTraining is important to make sure that your soldiers are competent. American soldiers are undertrained and incompetent. From what I have heard, US soldiers rarely train above the company level. In contrast, the PLA stages massive, realistic military exercises in environments with active electronic warfare, where all aspects of performance are tracked and measured. USAF pilots are also undertrained and incompetent.\n\nhttps://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-flying-hours-decline-again-after-brief-recovery/\n\nIn 2018, before the pandemic, USAF active duty fighter pilots only flew 8.2 hours per month, or 98.4 hours per year. They will be completely dominated and destroyed by Chinese pilots who fly 120-150 hours per year.\n\nThe US military is also undermanned, with all branches experiencing recruitment problems. China has more volunteers than they know what to do with.\n\nThe people in the USN are very sleep deprived and keep crashing their ships into things and setting their ships on fire. I have not heard about any of this happening in China.\n\nAlso, China has a vastly bigger population of 1.412 billion, compared to just 331.9 million for the US (so 4.25 times as many people). They can thus absorb vastly more casualties.\n\nIn addition, China\u2019s economy is absolutely massive. In terms of industrial GDP (PPP), China has more manufacturing than the US and EU combined ($9,400,050,000,000 for China, $8,955,940,000,000 for the US and EU). This means that they can produce more shells, missiles, etc. than the US, and will be hard to defeat in a war of attrition (the US, NATO, Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc. combined, plus maybe production from Mexico and other countries, may outproduce China, but coordinating all of these to work together effectively may be hard, Japan may have a hard time producing stuff while China is lobbing missiles at them, South Korea may not be cooperative due to its strong economic ties with China, and Iran and Russia may arm China as well). China is basically self sufficient in terms of grain and vegetable production, and thus won\u2019t starve even if a blockade occurs, and produces enough coal for domestic energy consumption (and is switching to green energy, anyways). They only import Australian coal for metallurgy, and metallurgical coal could just be rationed for military production if the supply decreases. Russia, Iran, and central Asia will be available to supply China with natural gas and minerals in the event of a blockade of China.\n\nChina also has greater fighting spirit than the west. Most people in the west might not be very enthusiastic about fighting China, do not trust their governments much, and are soft and not used to hardship. Most Chinese people yearn to take back Taiwan, which they see as their rightful territory, to get revenge on the west for past humiliations, are extremely nationalistic and think the CCP is amazing, and are extremely hardworking and willing to bear extreme hardship. \n\nChina is obviously the most powerful country in the world. Their extremely fast economic growth from being a third world shithole to being the world\u2019s largest economy demonstrates their competence. The west has been complacent, focusing on fighting goat herders in the middle east instead of peer wars, and has allowed China to match and surpass it in terms of military technology. If a war between China and the US starts, I think that it will look like the Gulf War, but even more one-sided, with the US being Iraq and China being the US, because of how China is stronger than the US in basically every single area and because America is decaying and its military is completely hollowed-out and rotten.",
