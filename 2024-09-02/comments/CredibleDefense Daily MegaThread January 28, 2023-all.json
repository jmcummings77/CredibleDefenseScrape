In response, People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) forces began flowing into North Vietnam in July 1965 to help defend Hanoi and its major transportation systems.\u200a The total number of Chinese troops in North Vietnam between June 1965 and March 1968 amounted to over 320,000.\u200a \u201cThe peak year was 1967 when 170,000 Chinese soldiers were present.</a></p>\n\n<p>And let&#39;s also look at their military equipment assistance:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_in_the_Vietnam_War#The_end_of_China%E2%80%99s_assistance\">Between the period of 1964-1975 Vietnam was Given by China 1.92 million guns, 64 thousand artillery pieces, 17 million artillery shells, 1 billion bullets, 30 thousand radio transmitters, 48 thousand telephones, 560 tanks, 164 planes and 15 thousand automobiles</a></p>\n\n<p>17 million artillery shells, wrap your mind around that number. Military assistance to Ukraine has been significant but pales in comparison to how much Soviets and China assisted Vietnam while not being formally involved. And that&#39;s just those two countries and not counting countries in soviet/sino sphere who were also militarily assisting Vietnam. Like Czechoslovakia who continued to send tens of thousands of Czech-made rifles as well as mortar and artillery throughout the war.</p>\n</div>",

Yield is an issue because low yield means you're limited to small and thus rather useless chips. The bigger chips are, the higher the chance there's a defect in it, but the more useful they are. I have no doubt China can make a small number of tiny 4nm chips, it's just that it's completely pointless _except_ as a stepping stone. \n\n> But it'd also be foolish to assume it's somehow impossible for everyone else to duplicate what ASML has done\n\nLet me give you an idea of the scale of ASML.\n\nThey employ 100000 people directly, most of them engineers and techs. \n\nThey work with a network of a 1000 specialized suppliers. Chief among them is Zeiss, which appears to have an edge in its own right in the market and contributes a large part of the value of ASML machines.

Yield is an issue because low yield means you&#39;re limited to small and thus rather useless chips. The bigger chips are, the higher the chance there&#39;s a defect in it, but the more useful they are.

That left a gigantic \"hole\" that the Ukrainians found and exploited before available Russian reserves could respond. By the time additional Russian forces were available, they could only hold the Svatove-Kreminna line, losing everything else to the west because they weren't there in enough numbers. They were elsewhere.\n\nThat was the result of outmaneuvering the Russians. The Ukrainians created a situation to force the Russians to move the forces, the prospect of a major offensive to retake the South, the Kherson bridgehead and to Melitopol. Putin didn't want to lose either, the only way to hold that ridiculously large frontage was to rob Peter to pay Paul. That meant lower priority areas, namely south of  Staryi Saltiv all the way to Lyman was largely left bare of troops, at least in terms of what was needed to hold that line against a legit massed, coordinate, and fires heavy attack.\n\nThe Ukrainians created an operational weak point and then they exploited it. And that's the essence of maneuver warfare, using movement to enable strategy. Yes, attrition still occurs and matters, but it's not the primary strategy, which is a very dangerous game to play against Russia after the mobilization. \n\nUkraine-Russian kill ratios aren't high enough, UA strategic policies and UAF tactics aren't good enough, their training isn't good enough, their technology isn't good enough, their logistics isn't good enough, their long term supply of equipment isn't good enough. They can't try to win a war against Russia in the same way that Russia intends to win the war against them and pretty much everyone else in modern history. \n\n>I do have to wonder from the Russian perspective, is there really any logic in a big Spring offensive?\n\nThey can retake the initiative, and depending on the locations of the attacks and how the Ukrainians respond, they could have some success.\n\n>To what degree has the Russian army retained offensive power throughout this war? \n\nDepends how those campaigns unfold. If they collapse into positional warfare and the Russians are still okay with incremental advances then they can still achieve success. Enough to achieve their strategic and operational goals? Probably no, but still enough to cause trouble, depending where they attack, how, when, and of course how the Ukrainians respond.\n\n> If advances in Soledar and Bakhmut were achieved with casualties mostly concentrated among convicts, is there sufficient supply of these guys to be used like this in the future?\n\nThe whole point of allowing Wagner to take the lead in that operation is back in the summer, months before partial mobilization was contemplated, Wagner had a way to dramatically increase the number of dismounted light infantry well beyond how they'd previously mostly been using LDNR doing very similar tactics. The only reason the Russian military weren't doing it is they didn't have enough dismounted infantry. However, from April-August they were regularly doing recon in force probing attacks using IFV and tanks, so it's not like they're being protected. \n\nYeah, Wagner gets to use their excons more callously than real Russian troops, but not by much. Russian troops are still going to get used ruthlessly and with great waste. And if the Russian brass and Putin think that gains them a strategic victory, that was the reason to mobilize them. And if need be, as recent reporting shows, they might be doing more mobilizing.",

Preferably the 22s. \n\nThere is nothing currently in service that can match the R-37, which was built to fill a very specific purpose. Not even the old Phoenix missile is as good, though both missiles had a similar target in mind. The AIM-120C is not a match for the R-37&MiG-31, the -120D probably wont be either. The French Meteor missile is, IIRC, supposed to be similar. But is still designed for a shorter range bracket. Really nothing is like the MiG-31 except the F-15, and as good as that plane is it doesn't have a missile like the R-37.\n\nWhy is because of mission, the R-37 was designed to be used in tandem with R-27 equipped SU-27s, and was designed to gank American AWACs from the other side of a border (not dissimilar to how Russia is using them now). The US didn't plan to attack Russian AWACs this way, and focused more on anti-fighter air superiority and bomber penetration. The counter would have been good battlefield control alongside offensive ECM jamming. At the ranges the R-37 operates in (and unlike the R-27 Semi-Active and IR missiles) jamming is very effective, though IIRC the -37M has home on jam capability. But its very hard for a fighter to get a radar return at that range and ECM can def ruin that. The MIG-31 also relies on the fact that it flies high and fast, it is *dogshit* low and slow (funnily, the papa of the MiG-31, the -25 caused a huge scare. The USAF *thought* it was an all around monster, fighting high or low, fast or slow. It wasn't, its quite a dog. But the fear spawned the F-15 which *is* a monster high or low, fast or slow. Basically they built a plan to beat the thing they were afraid of, before realizing that the Soviets didn't even have the thing they were afraid of.) The other solution for USAF planners would be to pull the MiGs in to the border and then gank them with American aircraft. But thats not something Ukraine can do, because were talking about violating a major chunk of well defended Russian airspace, and anyway the SU-27 would do the mission better it was designed to do just that mission against US F-15s. \n\nThe R-37 has turned out to be an issue, IMO it would have been an issue for the USAF even. It exists in a capability gap and is, again IMO, highlighting a flawed assumption in how the USAF has expected to fight. Which is that they'll always have a range advantage over adversaries. The USAF doesn't have a great answer for it now, except for stealth and the new AIM-260. It certainly doesn't have anything from the last generation to give Ukraine.",

A new F-16 Block 70/72 [reportedly](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/27553-top-10-most-expensive-fighter-jets-in-2021) costs about $64 million. \n\nTomahawk cruise missiles (TLAMs) have a unit cost of $2M each for the latest Block V variant, and only about 10% less for the earlier Block IV variant. \n\nThat's appropriately 32 cruise missiles for the cost of an F-16. There's no way that's anywhere close to enough to take multiple air bases out of commission while also sinking the Black Sea Fleet.

The VKS **has been firing up to six R-37Ms per day during October**, and the extremely high speed of the weapon, coupled with very long effective range and a seeker designed for engaging low-altitude targets, makes it particularly difficult to evade.\n\nSix missiles a day is a lot. Ukraine doesn't have that much aircraft.\n\n**So, apparently you can dodge them in 'vintage' aircraft despite high initial speed and launches from markedly less than its maximum range**.\n\n- R-37 is a huge beast of a rocket - [check out its wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-37_(missile\\)) - it's over 600kg in weight. It's more of an airborne reverse SAM (as in comes from above rather than below) than an AAM. It's 'original' mission was that of an AWACS and other C&C aircraft killer - slow, lumbering, but well protected targets. While it can certainly hit fighter aircraft, I'd wager that it's not optimized for the mission of killing fighter aircraft *that know it's coming*. AIM-54 'suffered' from the same 'flaw'. \n\nI don't have any performance data on R-37 (obviously), [but let's take a look at the AIM-54 testing that Iranians put to very good use during the Iran-Iraq war](https://www.navy.mil/DesktopModules/ArticleCS/Print.aspx?PortalId=1&ModuleId=724&Article=2168381):\n\n> 1973:\n> June Hughes completed their testing program with a world record-setting performance; launched from an F-14A over Pt. Mugu, a Phoenix missile was launched against a BQM-34E Firebee drone at a distance of 110 nautical miles. This shattered the previous record of 76 nautical miles, which was achieved during the RDT&E phase. At the time the missile had achieved a 77% success rate, with 43 scored hits out of a total of 56 missiles launched from various aircraft.\n\nSo, during testing, there's been a 77% success rate on a drone (presumably flying straight and level).\n\nI know, I know, 70s technology but actually there's a hell of a lot of factors going into missile performance and combat effectiveness (if the first article linked (combat experiences) *isn't* anything to go by, then the RUSI report should be).\n\nOne of them is for sure how close to the Maximum Range you are firing them. I'd say forget about those ~400 km ranges against a maneuvering target\n\n- Active Radar Homing missiles, like R-37, AMRAAM, Meteor, Phoenix and such are a marked improvement over older SARH in that they carry their own radar with them. The problem with them carrying their own radar is the power generation and size - they're usually not very powerful. \n\nWhile the missile is on the way to the target it is inertially guided, receiving a mid-course update from the launching aircraft, otherwise it comes nowhere near the effectiveness improvement over your run-of-the-mill SARH missile. Either way, against a maneuvering target, the effectiveness diminishes still.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, R-37's radar comes on only in the last ~30km.\n\n- So, how do you fight MiG-31 in an F-16?\n\nSince R-37 is not actually some mythical piece of unbeatable technology that you need a stealth aircraft to handle, I would say you fight them with HARM, AMRAAM and numbers.\n\nHARM **silences SAMs** which are in my humble opinion **a much larger threat than the R-37 and actually *enable* the R-37 harassment**. It enables you to approach anywhere near MiG-31s.\n\nAMRAAM forces them to fire from further away, diminishing the missiles effectiveness - also potentially makes some kills, which in turn makes them fly more conservatively.\n\nNumbers diminish their efficiency by making the airspace 'hotter', and help with HARM point. It also helps with losses, obviously.\n\nEither way, it for sure wouldn't be a walk-in-the-park, but nothing in this war is.\n\nIn my humble opinion, F-16s without HARMs and an improved BVR missile wouldn't make THAT much sense.",

Behind a forest or hill, around a corner, in a ditch...\n\nModern tanks also have really great optics that are designed for long-range use. In fact, tanks prefer to be at a distance regardless of ATGMs, because their awareness up close is significantly worse. A tank is perfectly happy sitting in a treeline 2km pretending to be a bush, or on a ridgeline with only its commander's sight peeking out. It will be super hard for the enemy to detect, but its telescopic sights and thermal imagers will be finding targets with ease. Then it pops out, shoots, and gets back in cover.\n\nTanks have to work in coordination with infantry in general - that's the basic principle of combined arms - but they're far from helpless on their own if used properly. You don't want to charge into a forest or town without infantry clearing it ahead; there could be an RPG behind every tree or in every window. But you can move from cover to cover, supported by the rest of the platoon, constantly vigilant and aware of potential threats and where the lines of sight are. You can lurk, using obstacles to limit where you can be attacked from, snapping up anything that pops up to engage your infantry.

In fact, tanks prefer to be at a distance regardless of ATGMs, because their awareness up close is significantly worse. A tank is perfectly happy sitting in a treeline 2km pretending to be a bush, or on a ridgeline with only its commander&#39;s sight peeking out. It will be super hard for the enemy to detect, but its telescopic sights and thermal imagers will be finding targets with ease. Then it pops out, shoots, and gets back in cover.</p>\n\n<p>Tanks have to work in coordination with infantry in general - that&#39;s the basic principle of combined arms - but they&#39;re far from helpless on their own if used properly. You don&#39;t want to charge into a forest or town without infantry clearing it ahead; there could be an RPG behind every tree or in every window. But you can move from cover to cover, supported by the rest of the platoon, constantly vigilant and aware of potential threats and where the lines of sight are. You can lurk, using obstacles to limit where you can be attacked from, snapping up anything that pops up to engage your infantry.
