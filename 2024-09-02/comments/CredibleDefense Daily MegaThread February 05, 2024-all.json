Are they going to be necessary for any force or will a western militaries superiority make it so that are just a nuisance?  Does watching the logistical strain caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict lead you one way or the other? Which side of the debate do you come down on?\n\n[Case in Point How Much NATO is Out of Sync with Reality Regarding FPV Drones: Polish Expert Explains Why FPVs are Unnecessary | Defense Express | February 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/analysis/case_in_point_how_much_nato_is_out_of_sync_with_reality_regarding_fpv_drones_polish_expert_explains_why_fpvs_are_unnecessary-9406.html)\n\n*Although the practice has demonstrated a clear shift in the landscape of the modern battlefield and the urgent need for adaptation, dissenting voices within NATO persist in their belief that no changes are necessary*\n\n*Armies of NATO, especially in Europe, continue to ignore the emergence of FPV drones as a weapon class. Small, maneuverable, and explosive, a cheap mass-produced drone with simple camera and a munition, has overthrown the tables of the ongoing war between russia and Ukraine. Still, it remains not just unnoticed but outright ignored by NATO generals.*\n\n*A Bundeswehr officer earlier explained such an approach from the perspective of security concerns, since the Alliance cannot allow any reliance on components procured from China. Sometimes, however, a completely opposite argument is mentioned within the discourse that FPVs are not worth taking seriously.*\n\n*Well-known Polish military expert Jaros\u0142aw Wolski wrote an in-depth analysis in a social media post, in which he delved into the issue of FPV drones' application. Defense Express would like to start a debate on this matter. Because if we put things briefly, the main point of Wolski is that FPV drones are but a makeshift solution for a specific situation, i.e. a weapon for the poor.*\n\n*\"In civilized NATO armies fighting in-depth, what the Ukrainians and russians are trying to do with hundreds of drones would be done by one F-16 with a CBU-97 cluster bomb, a battery of four M109 with SADARMs firing 16 SADARM missiles, or 2\u20134 Ah-64Es firing 16\u201332 Hellfire II/JAGM. Or even our Otokary-Brzoza with Brimstone II. Whatever would still crawl up to 1\u20135 km from FEBA (Forward Edge of the Battle Area - ed.) would have to be met with... something that Ukraine still almost does not have on a battalion scale: for a mechanized company, for example, with 24 EuroSpike/MELS or Spike ATGMs, and in the worst case, with the same number of TOW- 2Bs,\" the Jaros\u0142aw Wolski wrote.*\n\n*This fragment vividly illustrates the problem with understanding the realities of a battlefield during a war of attrition.*\n\n*In order to launch CBU-97 free-fall bombs onto the enemy columns, an F-16 needs to enter the airspace controlled within the range of enemy air defense systems, which is only plausible in the event of achieving total air superiority. The fact that the Ukrainian Air Force denied such superiority to the russian forces at the onset of the invasion in 2022 with only 40 combat-capable aircraft against the overall 1,000 combat jets of the russian Aerospace Forces should at least make NATO think twice about the real prospects and timeframes of taking a decisive control of the airspace when faced against the Russian federation.*\n\n*The same issue also applies to the mentioned Ah-64E Apache attack helicopters because such conditions will significantly limit the scale of operations they can perform in hostile airspace. The method of utilization of these helicopters will differ from any other experience they had during previous wars.*\n\n*The point about only four howitzers needed to stop the offensive is interesting, too, especially combined with the mention of SADARM \u2013 an artillery shell with autonomously guided submunitions, similar in action to SMArt 155 or Bonus. While there is no doubt about the effectiveness of this kind of weapon, the more important factor here is the quantity of them stored in NATO warehouses and produced a month, so the shell supply keeps up with the enemy columns.*\n\n*No less significant is the density of artillery coverage in European countries, and in Poland particularly, since Warsaw only has about a hundred 155mm artillery systems, even though is currently solving the shortage by procuring K9s from Korea. This many artillery pieces is actually relatively high in comparison to the rest of Europe, it is on par with the German Bundeswehr or the French Armed Forces.*\n\n*Another interesting point about Ottokar-Brzoza \u2014 a conceptually proper modern tank-killer, \u2014 but the first units are yet to arrive in the Polish army. Simply put, a great vehicle which is lacking in numbers. This is true for the Spike missiles it uses: the production of this weapon is so lagging that Warsaw had to procure and localize the Javelin ATGM.*\n\n*In summary, the main challenge posed by a war of attrition is not what type of weapon you choose to fight with during the first days or weeks of hostilities but what you will use at dawn of your third year of fighting non-stop. Ukraine found a solution in FPV drones, notwithstanding all their obvious drawbacks and imperfections. But apparently, NATO countries do not even consider a protracted war scenario at all because they deem it \"impossible.\"*",

Whatever would still crawl up to 1\u20135 km from FEBA (Forward Edge of the Battle Area - ed.) would have to be met with... something that Ukraine still almost does not have on a battalion scale: for a mechanized company, for example, with 24 EuroSpike/MELS or Spike ATGMs, and in the worst case, with the same number of TOW- 2Bs,&quot; the Jaros\u0142aw Wolski wrote.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This fragment vividly illustrates the problem with understanding the realities of a battlefield during a war of attrition.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In order to launch CBU-97 free-fall bombs onto the enemy columns, an F-16 needs to enter the airspace controlled within the range of enemy air defense systems, which is only plausible in the event of achieving total air superiority. The fact that the Ukrainian Air Force denied such superiority to the russian forces at the onset of the invasion in 2022 with only 40 combat-capable aircraft against the overall 1,000 combat jets of the russian Aerospace Forces should at least make NATO think twice about the real prospects and timeframes of taking a decisive control of the airspace when faced against the Russian federation.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The same issue also applies to the mentioned Ah-64E Apache attack helicopters because such conditions will significantly limit the scale of operations they can perform in hostile airspace. The method of utilization of these helicopters will differ from any other experience they had during previous wars.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The point about only four howitzers needed to stop the offensive is interesting, too, especially combined with the mention of SADARM \u2013 an artillery shell with autonomously guided submunitions, similar in action to SMArt 155 or Bonus. While there is no doubt about the effectiveness of this kind of weapon, the more important factor here is the quantity of them stored in NATO warehouses and produced a month, so the shell supply keeps up with the enemy columns.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>No less significant is the density of artillery coverage in European countries, and in Poland particularly, since Warsaw only has about a hundred 155mm artillery systems, even though is currently solving the shortage by procuring K9s from Korea. This many artillery pieces is actually relatively high in comparison to the rest of Europe, it is on par with the German Bundeswehr or the French Armed Forces.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Another interesting point about Ottokar-Brzoza \u2014 a conceptually proper modern tank-killer, \u2014 but the first units are yet to arrive in the Polish army. Simply put, a great vehicle which is lacking in numbers. This is true for the Spike missiles it uses: the production of this weapon is so lagging that Warsaw had to procure and localize the Javelin ATGM.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In summary, the main challenge posed by a war of attrition is not what type of weapon you choose to fight with during the first days or weeks of hostilities but what you will use at dawn of your third year of fighting non-stop. Ukraine found a solution in FPV drones, notwithstanding all their obvious drawbacks and imperfections. But apparently, NATO countries do not even consider a protracted war scenario at all because they deem it &quot;impossible.&quot;</em></p>\n</div>",

You've managed to sum it up far better.\n\nSome pro-Ukrainian commentators seem to have this annoying tendency to treat what goes on with the Ukrainian military as some sort of *perfect* solution across all areas of warfare, rather than the product of *specific* circumstances and specific *choices*, dating back *decades*, that contribute to a unique tactical/operational/strategic picture. If someone says that drones are not the guaranteed future of warfare and that NATO is *not* stupid for not immediately putting all it's efforts into mass producing FPV drones, then obviously that's because they don't understand that the current Ukrainian solution is perfect and the only way to proceed. If a commentator suggests that the 2023 counteroffensive did not fail because NATO trainers didn't do a whole course for their charges about using FPVs, then they're obviously a fool and the NATO training held Ukrainians back. Etc etc.\n\n(For what it's worth, the tendency obviously exists for other nations and militaries. It's just really visible with Ukraine at the moment because they're in an active war, but basically any \"best tank in the world\" debate involves someone doing the above tendency and ignoring the specific factors that drive designs to look the way they do.)\n\nThe fact is, and I challenge *anyone* to make a serious counterargument otherwise, that if a NATO nation **with a meaningful stockpile of modern NATO weapons** had been in Ukraine's position in 2022, we would not in 2024 be sitting talking about the battlefield impact of civilians crowdfunding another hundred DJI drones to glue bombs to. That's not in *any* way to delegitimise the Ukrainian military, because they did a fantastic job from that position they were in in 2022, it's to say that the stalemate is a product of them being able to hold back the Russians but not to *push* back the Russians, outside the offensives of 2022. The equipment they had to work with, the enemy they had to face, the achievements of such enemy that they have to roll back, these all combine to create what we see today, and thus attempting to draw hard axioms as to the Future Of Warfare from it is silly. \n\nMost people with actual analytical thought understood that the drone stuff we saw in Nagorno-Karabkh was not some guaranteed herald of things to come but the product of a whole bunch of specific conditions that happened to align for what we saw. They also understood that the TB2 success early in the war was the product of specific conditions: Russians attempting deathstacks without bothering to properly operate air defence, the VKS not being able to actually sustain air superiority, etc etc, and again was not some herald of the TB2 as an invincible superweapon of war. So why are we now, once again watching a situation that is the result of very specific conditions, this time having to deal with a whole load of commentary about \"this is actually the guaranteed future and you're an idiot if you think squadrons of F-35s would do better than this\"?",

Moving forward, what specific initiatives should the Washington Summit take to meet the challenges of a more competitive age?\u00a0\n\n\nAs we head closer to the next US general elections, the conference will also look at what implications a new US administration might have, both on the transatlantic relationship, and on NATO as a military alliance. As the war in Ukraine has pushed Moscow closer to Beijing, the US is increasingly divided between two fronts. Will the US and its NATO allies be able to stand united with Ukraine for \u00abas long as it takes\u00bb? And as the US is increasingly shifting focus away from Europe and possibly NATO, Europe must take more responsibility for its own security.

One of the most important problems in optimization is the Cutting-Stock problem, which tries to minimize the waste of steel. It might also be used for more logistics-based stuff - how many troops to where, what is a good upper bound on the number of artillery strikes on this particular location, etc. Naturally, since all this deals with models, it means that the solutions are only partially applicable.

And when her husband's time is up, he won't get a pardon and won't be able to go home immediately as the contract \"will be automatically extended\".\n\n>Posts on social media from other Russians whose relatives are serving in Storm V units indicate they too will have to stay on the front line until the end of what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\".  \n\n>Now the only way for prisoners to get a full release is if they get a state decoration, become incapacitated, reach the maximum age limit, or if the war itself ends.\n\n>Instead of a pardon, former prisoners now get what is described as a conditional release at the end of their time with the army. That means if they are found guilty of committing a new crime their sentence will also reflect their previous convictions. \n\n>\"The conditions are sort of better. You get full pay, like in the military, and all the other benefits and allowances,\" one convict writes.\n\n>\"Your chances of survival are about 25%. I've been a stormtrooper for five months. Out of our platoon of about 100 men, only 38 are still alive,\" another says.\n\n>Many of the Storm V troops are trained at a range for as little as 10 days before being despatched. There are several dozen known cases of convicts who have found themselves on the front line after only three to five days of training. In comparison, Soviet conscripts in Afghanistan got up to six months' training before deployment.\n\n>Since January 2023, BBC Russian has partnered with the Russian website Mediazona and a team of volunteers to identify the names of Russian fighters killed in the war. More than 8,000 prisoners have died serving in Ukraine, and at least 1,100 of them fought in Storm V units or the units they replaced. \n\n>We only include in our database those prisoners whose sentences have been confirmed by a published court verdict. But not all verdicts are digitised, and not all deaths are reported. In reality, the number of dead convicts is estimated to be far higher.\n\n>In a chatroom, Sergei discusses the fate of Russian convicts like himself still fighting in Storm V units. \"Luck isn't going to be enough,\" he writes, talking about his chance of survival on the front line. \"I already know I won't make it,\" he says.\n\nReally interesting article all around. It suggests that Russia has made dramatic changes to its system of recruiting convicts, including providing them with pay and benefits similar to other soldiers, but no longer giving them a pardon after 6 months and forcing them to remain in the military indefinitely. Notably, conditions for these units remain awful, training remains abysmally bad, and these recruits are still seen as imminently expendable which leads one to believe that very few of these convicts are likely to survive the war. A sentiment which appears to be the norm even among members of these units. \n\nPersonally, I think this is yet more evidence that the war isn't all sunshine and rainbows for Russia. If Russia really did have plentiful manpower, it wouldn't be recruiting convicts in the first place, let alone changing the terms so they're never to be released from service. That so many conscripts and volunteers are being kept in the service indefinitely also reinforces this notion. I expect Putin is still worried about the long-term consequences of mobilization and the destabilizing effects it will have on his regime and I also think the rosy recruitment figures provided by the Russian MOD aren't all they appear to be.",

It was more fair but hugely damaging as it meant at any given time a rifle company was a death factory if units were on the line, which most were. That meant an extremely high turnover, low cohesion, poor junior leaders, lack of skill, etc. \n\nThe Soviet-Russian model is actually a better one. While their conventional units still get hammered by casualties, the use of penal troops or convict units spares them more from the most casualty producing missions. That's the entire reason for doing it, the penal troops earned that role by being naughty boys, so they have to do the bloody work, so the \"better\" units can be spared. \n\nIt's not just more ethical for conventional troops, it's more efficient. Those units can train more, suffer less casualties, and increase their effectiveness. The cannon fodder units can be trained little because it doesn't matter for them, regardless of their skill they're going to get hammered with losses because they're doing a mission that's just extremely dangerous. The problem is when convention units are given those extremely dangerous missions,  all the talent, all the time spent training them, getting them to work as a team, etc, it's a giant waste. \n\nThat's actually a big conversation happening in the West. Infantry have never been better trained and equipped than now, they're closer to SOF standards than traditional infantry. And yet if they do high risk missions, which are required in high intensity warfare, they're going to get hammered with losses they can't replace. NCOs that take a half decade or more to create can't be recreated. Officers can't be among the best attending training (only the top performers in service schools or OCS are allowed into the infantry), nobody will want to be infantry officers because it'll be a death sentence. Troops won't get 24 months of basic and infantry training before even showing up to their units. Etc. \n\nSo how do you keep the casualties down? One way is more training and better equipment. Another is to rely more on technology, fires, air support. Another is to not use those tactics, regardless if they're important, the overall mission is willingly sacrificed to lower casualties (we've done that in every war we've fought since Korea).",

It was more fair but hugely damaging as it meant at any given time a rifle company was a death factory if units were on the line, which most were. That meant an extremely high turnover, low cohesion, poor junior leaders, lack of skill, etc. </p>\n\n<p>The Soviet-Russian model is actually a better one. While their conventional units still get hammered by casualties, the use of penal troops or convict units spares them more from the most casualty producing missions. That&#39;s the entire reason for doing it, the penal troops earned that role by being naughty boys, so they have to do the bloody work, so the &quot;better&quot; units can be spared. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not just more ethical for conventional troops, it&#39;s more efficient. Those units can train more, suffer less casualties, and increase their effectiveness. The cannon fodder units can be trained little because it doesn&#39;t matter for them, regardless of their skill they&#39;re going to get hammered with losses because they&#39;re doing a mission that&#39;s just extremely dangerous. The problem is when convention units are given those extremely dangerous missions,  all the talent, all the time spent training them, getting them to work as a team, etc, it&#39;s a giant waste. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s actually a big conversation happening in the West. Infantry have never been better trained and equipped than now, they&#39;re closer to SOF standards than traditional infantry. And yet if they do high risk missions, which are required in high intensity warfare, they&#39;re going to get hammered with losses they can&#39;t replace. NCOs that take a half decade or more to create can&#39;t be recreated. Officers can&#39;t be among the best attending training (only the top performers in service schools or OCS are allowed into the infantry), nobody will want to be infantry officers because it&#39;ll be a death sentence. Troops won&#39;t get 24 months of basic and infantry training before even showing up to their units. Etc. </p>\n\n<p>So how do you keep the casualties down? One way is more training and better equipment. Another is to rely more on technology, fires, air support. Another is to not use those tactics, regardless if they&#39;re important, the overall mission is willingly sacrificed to lower casualties (we&#39;ve done that in every war we&#39;ve fought since Korea).</p>\n</div>",

Around this time Chechnya was in the midst of a civil war between secular nationalists and Islamists, and the Islamist faction had launched an offensive into Dagestan in August 1999. It was a mess.\n\nBy the time Russian units drove into Chechnya, many citizens welcomed them and they easily found pawns to fight their battles, and this was how the Kadyrov family came into power.
