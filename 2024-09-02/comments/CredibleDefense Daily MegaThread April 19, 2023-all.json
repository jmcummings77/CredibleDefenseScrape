As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

From there he will travel to Germany for a regular meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, where he and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley will host their counterparts around the world to discuss what the West can donate to Kyiv.\nTwo Patriot missile defense systems, one from the U.S. and one as part of a combined effort from Germany and the Netherlands, arrived in Ukraine on Wednesday, after a group of Ukrainian air defenders completed training to use the weapons.\n\nAustin is in Europe as questions continue to swirl over the leak of classified documents online, many of which were based on slides developed by the Joint Staff to brief senior Pentagon leaders on the situation in Ukraine. Some of those documents reflected U.S. concerns about the state of Kyiv\u2019s inventories ahead of the spring fighting, including a detailed accounting of Ukraine\u2019s dwindling supply of munitions and air defense missiles. Other intelligence documents reportedly included pessimistic U.S. assessments over Ukraine\u2019s ability to win the war this year.\n\nBut a second Defense Department official said the Pentagon would not allow \u201cany kind of spinning of negative information\u201d to undermine its continued support for Ukraine and cooperation with other Western countries.\n\n\u201cWell, [Ukraine] could run out of artillery ammunition \u2014 if we didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut we are absolutely going to provide them with the ammunition, the artillery, the spare parts, the maintenance, the sustainment, the platforms that they need.\u201d\n\nThe package includes additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems; 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds; tube-launched, optically-tracked wire-guided missiles for the U.S.-provided Bradley armored fighting vehicles; AT-4 anti-armor weapon systems; anti-tank mines; demolition munitions for obstacle clearing; over 9 million rounds of small arms ammunition; four logistics support vehicles; and precision aerial munitions.",

Although the airport there has been fought over in recent days, the tarmac is said to still be intact.  \nIn the morning, however, the Bundeswehr had to abort the delicate rescue mission. At that time, new fighting and air attacks were reported from the capital Khartoum. The Bundeswehr planners and the crisis team at the Federal Foreign Office (AA) then decided to abort the evacuation mission.  \nThe A400M aircraft are now to return to Germany for the time being. Other nations that had hoped for a brief ceasefire on Wednesday to rescue their nationals also called off their operations, security sources said.  \n\n\n  \n**Air strikes in Sudan's capital Khartoum apparently on the rise**  \nFighter jets over the capital, tanks in the trading centre  \nSince the outbreak of fighting, the crisis team of the German government has been discussing how to get the German citizens stuck in Sudan out of the crisis state. So far, the German government's evacuation lists include a good dozen diplomats from the German Embassy and the protective forces of the Federal Police, as well as a good hundred more Germans, most of them development workers who were working on projects in Sudan.  \nSo far, no Germans have been harmed by the fighting in Sudan, and the embassy in Khartoum has not been affected by the clashes either. Nevertheless, the German government is keen to get the Germans out of the combat zone, as an escalation of the conflict cannot be ruled out. Moreover, food and water supplies are dwindling, and not only at the embassy.  \n\n\n  \n**Robust mission under consideration**\n\n  \nThe crisis team must now decide whether the Bundeswehr should launch a robust rescue mission for the Germans. Plans are ready in the Ministry of Defence to support a possible military evacuation mission by the air force with paratrooper units, which would secure a possible pick-up point in Sudan by force of arms, similar to the rescue mission from Afghanistan.  \nFor such a much more dangerous evacuation mission, the Bundeswehr would presumably need a mandate from the German Bundestag, according to security sources. The corresponding forces of the Bundeswehr have already been available in Germany for days, ready to leave.",

So far, the German government&#39;s evacuation lists include a good dozen diplomats from the German Embassy and the protective forces of the Federal Police, as well as a good hundred more Germans, most of them development workers who were working on projects in Sudan.<br/>\nSo far, no Germans have been harmed by the fighting in Sudan, and the embassy in Khartoum has not been affected by the clashes either. Nevertheless, the German government is keen to get the Germans out of the combat zone, as an escalation of the conflict cannot be ruled out. Moreover, food and water supplies are dwindling, and not only at the embassy.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Robust mission under consideration</strong></p>\n\n<p>The crisis team must now decide whether the Bundeswehr should launch a robust rescue mission for the Germans. Plans are ready in the Ministry of Defence to support a possible military evacuation mission by the air force with paratrooper units, which would secure a possible pick-up point in Sudan by force of arms, similar to the rescue mission from Afghanistan.<br/>\nFor such a much more dangerous evacuation mission, the Bundeswehr would presumably need a mandate from the German Bundestag, according to security sources. The corresponding forces of the Bundeswehr have already been available in Germany for days, ready to leave.</p>\n</div>",

Ltd. could come to dominate the Russian market and may pose a risk to the country\u2019s information security and networks.\n\n>European officials familiar with the document said it suggests that Russia has backed itself into a corner since it struggles to produce advanced technology domestically and has been cut off from other foreign markets following the invasion of Ukraine. The report, drafted in the summer of 2022, highlights chips, network devices and electronics as areas of particular vulnerability. \n\n>Since then, the Russian authorities have managed to import some sanctioned US and European components via third countries, including through mainland China and Hong Kong, Bloomberg previously reported. But the US and the EU are tightening efforts to enforce their trade restrictions, suggesting procuring advanced technology may get more difficult. \n\n>The European officials said the assessment had been shared among several people in the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Russia\u2019s most senior military body, as well as some on the Security Council, which includes the country\u2019s defense and foreign affairs ministers and is led by President Vladimir Putin.  \n\n>The Russian worries about becoming over reliant on companies such as Huawei, China Mobile Ltd. and others echo some of the concerns raised in the US and parts of Europe about the security risk involved in using Chinese technology in sensitive parts of their information networks. \n\n>The analysis also underlines one of many strategic costs that the Kremlin has incurred since most economic ties to the EU and the US were severed due to the war: increased leverage for China. \n\n>The officials familiar with the memo said it confirms more recent reports that Russia has been seeking to source several technologies from China, such as radio electronics, routers, base stations, microelectronics, chips and materials used in semi-conductors. \n\n>While the officials said the document makes no mention of weapons, the US has sanctioned several Chinese companies for supplying components and goods allegedly used for military purposes in Ukraine.\n\n>There are still no signs of direct military support from China to Russia and the US and its allies are confident they would be able to detect any movement of significant military equipment from China, a European diplomat familiar with that assessment said. \n\n>The Biden administration has warned Beijing not to provide Moscow with weapons. China has repeatedly said it hasn\u2019t supplied Russia with weapons and accuses the US of stoking the conflict by providing arms to Ukraine.\n\n>The memo references multiple conversations between Russian and Chinese officials, including four video conference calls, in which the authors say supplies of tech components, boosting production capacity inside Russia and potential Chinese investments in Russian industry were discussed. According to the people familiar with the Russian document, those talks included officials from the ministry of trade and industry in Moscow and their Chinese counterparts, as well as representatives of Russian and Chinese companies. \n\n>The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it could not verify the authenticity of the information and that Beijing has a normal trading relationship with Russia. The Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media in Moscow didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment. \n\n>Russia prepared a list for Chinese officials detailing the goods it needs, also including equipment used in communications, networks, broadcasting and data centers, according to the people familiar with the document. \n\n>Russian officials still have ambitions of producing critical equipment themselves and people who spoke with Bloomberg say the memo suggests they are worried that their reliance on China may also hold back their domestic industry. That said, the Russian military started trying to replace foreign-made components with locally produced parts in its weapons systems years ago, and that effort has mostly failed, underlining the challenges Moscow faces in replicating advanced technology. \n\n>Not all the goods mentioned in the paper contain US- or EU-made parts, but, according to the Russian authors\u2019 assessment, there are likely no technologies in the segments of interest that don\u2019t at least depend on US or European intellectual property or production equipment such as chipmaking gear.\n\n>China has repeatedly criticized the use of sanctions to isolate Russia, but its companies have nevertheless been careful not to be seen in breach of US and EU measures, fearing that they could find themselves in the crosshairs of economic restrictions of their own. At a meeting with Putin last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to significantly increase bilateral trade.\n\n>In March, Xi also met with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin where the two committed to expand cooperation on trade, including on hi-tech, according to the news agency Xinhua. Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in such areas as investment, trade, energy, natural gas, peaceful use of nuclear energy, aviation and aerospace, scientific and technological innovation, cross-border transportation and logistics, and strengthen communication and cooperation in the safety of supply and industrial chains, food security and other issues, Mishustin said. \n\n>Total two-way merchandise trade between China and Russia jumped 72% to $190.3 billion in 2022 versus the pre-pandemic level of $110.9 billion in 2019, according to the Geneva-based Trade Data Monitor. The data show a marked increase in Russian imports of Chinese smartphones, motor vehicles and construction equipment. In return, Beijing increased its purchases of Russian energy products like oil, coal and natural gas.\n\n>The EU and Group of Seven nations have now stepped up their focus on sanctions circumvention, especially by enhancing their monitoring of so-called dual-use goods that can serve either military or civilian purposes. That effort has involved applying diplomatic pressure on third countries and putting in place tools to identify and target companies that may be helping Russia to get around restrictions.\n\n>The officials said that the memo describes how some more sensitive items such as radio-electronic devices may reach Russia through so-called partner channels. \n\n>Under that system, a manufacturer moves the items via land to an intermediary which then exports them to Russia, often via a third country. Transactions would be carried out in local currency, and product labels and customs documents could be altered, according to accounts of the Russian assessment. Some equipment may be unbranded. \n\n>Lower risk products such as mobile phones are often shipped through more regular paths but are increasingly sold through third-party dealers rather than directly.    \n\n>The European officials said that the paper sets out Russian concerns that having communications networks depend on Huawei devices poses a danger to information security, as well as to the reliability of networks and diminished opportunities for domestic providers. The assessment even suggests considering restrictions on technologies produced by Huawei and other Chinese companies in order to avoid a scenario of total dependence. \n\n>Huawei\u2019s press office in Berlin said it wasn\u2019t able to immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has repeatedly rejected such allegations.\n\n>Among other potential countermeasures, it suggests:\n\n>* Imposing quotas on Chinese goods\n>* Pushing Chinese firms to shift production to Russia\n>* Demanding Chinese providers use Russian nationals and sub-contractors\n>* Limiting the use of unbranded equipment\n>* Incentives such as long-term contracts and subsidies for Russian developers and telecommunication companies\n\n>Given the state of Russia\u2019s communications networks, the officials said that the memo\u2019s authors saw no immediate pressure for Russia to rush into full scale agreements with Chinese companies and Moscow had another one to two years to buy time that would be useful to enhance its domestic capacity and capabilities. That assessment though is now almost a year old.",
