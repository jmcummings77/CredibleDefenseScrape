But there was no hint of a coup or civil war or popular uprising (though he does profoundly fear those things so far as we know). A big slice of ordinary people barely cared one way or the other, and why should Putin care if they did? The basic compact between the powerful and the ordinary was intact.</p>\n\n<p>Whether that&#39;s true today, or whether the war has become a larger and more dangerous issue, I&#39;m not sure.</p>\n\n<p>But I suspect the persistence can be mostly explained by some combination of insulation from the truth, and a simple desire to win - he doesn&#39;t <em>want</em> to back out, he wants what he came for. As opposed to fear. Though who knows? Nobody here, I assume.</p>\n</div>",

And i guess all bets are off, but my main question is why would state apparatus abandon Putin.</p>\n\n<p>(There is a possibility of something like leaking the rigging but in Russoa that would likely fizzle out unless some important power players wanted him out. Which i admit is very complex, so the question is: does losing the war means Putin is a lame, well, still wolf, but lame? Are potential ambitious contenders feeling blood? Now i would like to read some analysis about that, because for now i am drawing conclusions myself based on what i see in Russia and i am far from attentive professional)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Putin can at least suggest </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My main question is how that talk translates into politics. Does anyone care about Crimea? Turbopatriots, Girkin, does. And they are preparing for civil war. But are they serious players? (I dont think anyone else cares)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Putin knows that he needs</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is, does he? Maybe he simply wants. If he was fearing, concerned about staying in power, he would likely be more smart to pay more attention to FSB ensuring their loyalry, or civilian administration too.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I have read for months how exporting long range missiles to Ukraine such as the Storm Shadow it has received would be complicated due to the Missile Technology Control Regime and they would need to have a limited range of 300 km. Ukraine has requested Taurus missile and people commented on how it would be a problem that it did not have an export version under 300 km. That made me finally read that export regime document.\n\n[That is their website][1], the sole source of the following.\n\nUnderstandably there is a lot of text, so I took out some excerpts, which capture the essence.\n\n## MTCR Guidelines and the Equipment, Software and Technology Annex\n\n> The Regime\u2019s documents include the MTCR Guidelines and the Equipment, Software and Technology Annex. The Guidelines define the purpose of the MTCR and provide the overall structure and rules to guide the member countries and those adhering unilaterally to the Guidelines. The Equipment, Software and Technology Annex is designed to assist in implementing export controls on MTCR Annex items. The Annex is divided into \u201cCategory I\u201d and \u201cCategory II\u201d items.\n\n\n## Guidelines for Sensitive Missile-Relevant Transfers\n\n> 2\\. The Annex consists of two categories of items, which term includes equipment and technology. Category I items, all of which are in Annex items 1 and 2, are those items of greatest sensitivity. If a Category I item is included in a system, that system will also be considered as Category I, except when the incorporated item cannot be separated, removed or duplicated. Particular restraint will be exercised in the consideration of Category I transfers regardless of their purpose, and there will be a strong presumption to deny such transfers. Particular restraint will also be exercised in the consideration of transfers of any items in the Annex, or of any missiles (whether or not in the Annex), if the Government judges, on the basis of all available, persuasive information, evaluated according to factors including those in paragraph 3, that they are intended to be used for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction, and there will be a strong presumption to deny such transfers. Until further notice, the transfer of Category I production facilities will not be authorised. The transfer of other Category I items will be authorised only on rare occasions and where the Government (A) obtains binding government-to-government undertakings embodying the assurances from the recipient government called for in paragraph 5 of these Guidelines and (B) assumes responsibility for taking all steps necessary to ensure that the item is put only to its stated end-use. It is understood that the decision to transfer remains the sole and sovereign judgement of the Government.\n\n## Equipment, Software and Technology Annex\n\n## CATEGORY I; ITEM 1\n\n> CATEGORY I\n>\n> ITEM 1 COMPLETE DELIVERY SYSTEMS\n>\n> 1.A. EQUIPMENT, ASSEMBLIES AND COMPONENTS\n>\n\n[Combined 1.A.1 and 1.A.2 for brevity]\n\n> \n> Complete rocket systems (including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets) and unmanned aerial vehicle systems (including cruise missiles, target drones and reconnaissance drones) capable of delivering at least a 500 kg \"payload\" to a \"range\" of at least 300 km.\n>\n\nThe rest of the items are complete subsystems usable for complete delivery systems. That includes equipment, assemblies and components, test and production equipment, software and technology.\n\nCategory II includes propulsion components and equipment, propellants, chemicals and propellant production, production of structural composites, pyrolytic deposition and densification, and structural materials, instrumentation, navigation and direction finding, flight control, avionics, launch support, computers, analogue to digital converters, test facilities and equipment, modelling-simulation and design integration, stealth, nuclear effects protection, other complete delivery systems and other complete subsystems.\n\nAs you can see Category II includes a whole lot, which is why the guidelines say particular restraint should be exercised in Category I transfers, while Category II is basically transfer these freely unless the receiver is North Korea or another rogue state that threatens to nuke your cities on a weekly basis.\n\nFrom my understanding, a cruise missile with a 450 kg warhead and a 300 km range and one with 1000 km range would both be Category II items. The former because of the propulsion unit, navigation and the rest of the components and technology inside, and the latter because it falls under Category II Item 19 Other complete delivery systems, 19.A Equipment, assemblies and components.\n\nTherefore limiting the range of a sub-500 kg warhead missile doesn't make sense and Ukraine's allies should feel free to export unlimited versions as long as the payload is limited. And which cruise missiles fit that description?\n\nTomahawk - 450 kg\n\nJASSM\u2010ER - 450 kg\n\nStorm Shadow - 450 kg\n\nMdCN - 300 kg\n\nTaurus KEPD 350 - 481 kg\n\nAnd even the Russian:\n\nKh-101 - 400 kg\n\nKh-32 - 500 kg\n\nKalibr - 400\u2013500 kg\n\n[1]: https://mtcr.info/mtcr-guidelines/",

That made me finally read that export regime document.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mtcr.info/mtcr-guidelines/\">That is their website</a>, the sole source of the following.</p>\n\n<p>Understandably there is a lot of text, so I took out some excerpts, which capture the essence.</p>\n\n<h2>MTCR Guidelines and the Equipment, Software and Technology Annex</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Regime\u2019s documents include the MTCR Guidelines and the Equipment, Software and Technology Annex. The Guidelines define the purpose of the MTCR and provide the overall structure and rules to guide the member countries and those adhering unilaterally to the Guidelines. The Equipment, Software and Technology Annex is designed to assist in implementing export controls on MTCR Annex items. The Annex is divided into \u201cCategory I\u201d and \u201cCategory II\u201d items.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Guidelines for Sensitive Missile-Relevant Transfers</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>2. The Annex consists of two categories of items, which term includes equipment and technology. Category I items, all of which are in Annex items 1 and 2, are those items of greatest sensitivity. If a Category I item is included in a system, that system will also be considered as Category I, except when the incorporated item cannot be separated, removed or duplicated. Particular restraint will be exercised in the consideration of Category I transfers regardless of their purpose, and there will be a strong presumption to deny such transfers. Particular restraint will also be exercised in the consideration of transfers of any items in the Annex, or of any missiles (whether or not in the Annex), if the Government judges, on the basis of all available, persuasive information, evaluated according to factors including those in paragraph 3, that they are intended to be used for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction, and there will be a strong presumption to deny such transfers. Until further notice, the transfer of Category I production facilities will not be authorised. The transfer of other Category I items will be authorised only on rare occasions and where the Government (A) obtains binding government-to-government undertakings embodying the assurances from the recipient government called for in paragraph 5 of these Guidelines and (B) assumes responsibility for taking all steps necessary to ensure that the item is put only to its stated end-use. It is understood that the decision to transfer remains the sole and sovereign judgement of the Government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Equipment, Software and Technology Annex</h2>\n\n<h2>CATEGORY I; ITEM 1</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>CATEGORY I</p>\n\n<p>ITEM 1 COMPLETE DELIVERY SYSTEMS</p>\n\n<p>1.A. EQUIPMENT, ASSEMBLIES AND COMPONENTS</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Combined 1.A.1 and 1.A.2 for brevity]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Complete rocket systems (including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets) and unmanned aerial vehicle systems (including cruise missiles, target drones and reconnaissance drones) capable of delivering at least a 500 kg &quot;payload&quot; to a &quot;range&quot; of at least 300 km.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rest of the items are complete subsystems usable for complete delivery systems. That includes equipment, assemblies and components, test and production equipment, software and technology.</p>\n\n<p>Category II includes propulsion components and equipment, propellants, chemicals and propellant production, production of structural composites, pyrolytic deposition and densification, and structural materials, instrumentation, navigation and direction finding, flight control, avionics, launch support, computers, analogue to digital converters, test facilities and equipment, modelling-simulation and design integration, stealth, nuclear effects protection, other complete delivery systems and other complete subsystems.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see Category II includes a whole lot, which is why the guidelines say particular restraint should be exercised in Category I transfers, while Category II is basically transfer these freely unless the receiver is North Korea or another rogue state that threatens to nuke your cities on a weekly basis.</p>\n\n<p>From my understanding, a cruise missile with a 450 kg warhead and a 300 km range and one with 1000 km range would both be Category II items. The former because of the propulsion unit, navigation and the rest of the components and technology inside, and the latter because it falls under Category II Item 19 Other complete delivery systems, 19.A Equipment, assemblies and components.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore limiting the range of a sub-500 kg warhead missile doesn&#39;t make sense and Ukraine&#39;s allies should feel free to export unlimited versions as long as the payload is limited. And which cruise missiles fit that description?</p>\n\n<p>Tomahawk - 450 kg</p>\n\n<p>JASSM\u2010ER - 450 kg</p>\n\n<p>Storm Shadow - 450 kg</p>\n\n<p>MdCN - 300 kg</p>\n\n<p>Taurus KEPD 350 - 481 kg</p>\n\n<p>And even the Russian:</p>\n\n<p>Kh-101 - 400 kg</p>\n\n<p>Kh-32 - 500 kg</p>\n\n<p>Kalibr - 400\u2013500 kg</p>\n</div>",

From the edges of Kostyantynivka, about 12 miles west of Bakhmut, which Russia captured a week ago, soldiers from Ukraine\u2019s 24th Separate Assault Battalion pounded enemy trenches on the city\u2019s southern flank with artillery fired from an old Soviet D30 howitzer on Saturday.\n\nIt was not so different from what they have been doing for weeks. But soldiers here cited one big change.\n\n\u201cThe Wagner guys have left and the [regular Russians] have come in,\u201d said a 26-year-old commander who asked to be identified by his call sign, Chichen. He used an anti-Russian ethnic slur to refer to the troops who appear to be replacing the mercenaries, including convicts recruited directly from prisons, who led Russia\u2019s months-long onslaught.\n\nIf confirmed, the rotation of forces would mark a major shift, making units under the Russian military\u2019s regular command responsible for holding the city \u2014 and allowing Wagner leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin to pull away after claiming to have achieved the only big territorial gain for the Kremlin since last summer.\n\nMoving regular Russian units to defend Bakhmut could create vulnerabilities at other locations along the front, which stretches hundreds of miles \u2014 weaknesses that Ukraine might try to exploit as it seeks to snatch back occupied territory in a counteroffensive that could begin at any moment.\n\nAfter declaring Bakhmut fully under Russian control, Prigozhin quickly announced his forces would leave beginning on Thursday, but his motivations and true plans have been difficult to discern.\nSoldiers with the 24th Separate Assault Battalion said they had seen that Wagner fighters had withdrawn and were replaced by regular Russian troops in the areas they were targeting, but emphasized that they could not know for sure if this was a permanent shift, or happening elsewhere.\n\n\u201cKnowing that Wagner is not a fair player, I won\u2019t believe them until we see what the captured [Russian] soldiers are saying,\u201d said a 26-year-old drone operator who asked to be referred to by his nickname, Chuck, for security reasons.\n\nChuck said he was hopeful that Wagner forces, who adopted unorthodox strategies that they found hard to deal with, would leave. \u201cFighting with regular Russian forces is not as hard as fighting with Wagner,\u201d he said.\n\n**Chichen said it was easier to target regular Russian troops.\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because the Wagner guys were sitting back in their little bunkers not coming out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas the Russians, they\u2019re young, they\u2019re fresh, they\u2019re new, and they basically just walk out. Then we give them hell.\u201d**\n\nUkrainian officials have insisted that they still have a small foothold within the Bakhmut city limits and that they are making gains on the flanks of the city, which they said was part of a plan for a \u201csemi-encirclement.\u201d\n\nTheoretically, that plan would allow them to eventually retake the city, in part by forcing the occupying Russians to withstand artillery fire from higher ground.

Every time Russians attack only Kyiv the numbers look crazy, but if they mix it with attacks on other cities then you can spot Russian hits pretty easily there. And it was mostly like that even before Kyiv got Patriots, so it's pretty consistent. It also is the place where air defense being the best makes total sense.\n\n\n It's just that the usual Russian pattern was attacking different cities across the country every 2-3 weeks or so, along with some C300 attacks on Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, which Ukraine could not do anything about, so the hits were noticeable. And now that Russians are more focused on Kyiv, people are surpised like these interception rates came out of nowhere. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is - if Ukraine lies about the interception rates, they've done it consistenly for a long time now and in a way that  logically makes sense, so it's not that hard to believe in. Add in the fact that at times they're simply manipulating the way these numbers are presented, e.g. a) using only good Kyiv numbers and spreading infographics with them right after the attack when other cities were clearly attacked as well, and then just silently adding up numbers from other cities to the total; or  b) putting good numbers at first, saying smth like \"the data is being gathered\" for half a day, and when everyone is already discussing the interception rates from the morning or previous day, they are \"correcting the numbers\" later, which no one cares about at that point. There are also other possible factors such as damage from debris of the intercepted missiles, decoy missiles that are being counted, but are not supposed to really damage, etc.\n\nIn the end, although I'd never take official UA numbers at face value, I'd equally discourage straight up ignoring them.  From my experience, if there's a big juicy hit from a Russian attack, it all eventually comes up in the reports if you look at them carefuly enough and throught the whole day, or sometimes even the day after. This post may as well just be copium too, but we don't have full information one way or another.",

The point I'm making is that regardless of what these AD systems are shooting down, the inventory capacity isn't unlimited and active production is under incredible pressure, let alone the pressure imparted by a peer to peer conflict such as this one.   \n\n\nAs another example, Stingers have been shown to have widespread use in this conflict, which is unsurprising as Ukraine have received thousands, over 2000 from the US alone with additional deliveries from other nations. They've been used in pretty much every aspect you could imagine, even intercepting Cruise Missiles in flight.   \n\n\nWhich is fantastic to be clear, they're being put to use and all is well. The problem is the US Army has ordered a further 1300 units as replacements for the 2000 they have delivered. (There's likely to be an additional order soon ontop of this). The manufacturing capacity for the replacement stock is only *40 Stingers per month*, and that capacity is set to rise to an utterly staggering ***60 units*** per month by ***2025***...  \n\n\nThese inventories were built up decades ago when aerial threats were already a problem, now with Shaheds and the massive proliferation of drones and cheaper systems it's clear that our existing manufacturing capacity isn't capable of keeping up. Once those inventories are gone, they're gone. Western nations have already delved deep into their stockpiles, if Ukraine keeps burning through them at their current rate it won't be long until western deliveries dry up. Perhaps not for NASAMs or a limited delivery of additional MANPADS and IRIS-T missiles, but realistically nations are not going to start widely disarming their own militaries to prop up Ukrainian AD if the conflict remains in a stalemate.  \n\n\nIn the last month or so of attacks there have only been around 100\\~ cruise missiles (including Khinzals etc) whereas there have been 294 (that we know of, confirmed by Ukrainian AD) Shaheds. Considering Ukrainian AD have claimed a near 100% shoot down rate for months now, if we believe them, it's likely they're using all of the equipment at their disposal which going forward will include Patriots.  \n\n\nI get that we'd like to presume that \"well they'll save the patriots for the good shit and have a near 100% interception rate with a very effective web of MANPADS, SPAAGs, short range AD\" etc, but the reality is that AD networks are messy and inefficient, when shit starts flying missiles from multiple different systems and batteries will be engaging, attacks don't happen in a vacuum and there's usually only minutes with which to respond, time which isn't always perfectly spent making sure the right missiles are used on the right targets.  \n\n\nReality is that at some point or another (whether it's happened yet, or yet to happen) Patriot missiles will be spent on these Shaheds. Which isn't itself the issue, the issue is that the production capacity doesn't even come CLOSE to the rate at which they're currently burning through them. That 30 odd launch against the Khinzals alone accounted for a little over a month and a half of Patriot production, production which it's worth noting is not exclusively intended for Ukraine.  \n\n\nGod I just realized how much I wrote here...

                "body": "Katz is a well known politician who was one of the major players in a political party that credibly challenged Putin's \"One Russia\" party. In fact their success is widely credited with why Russia bothers to fake nearly all election results these days - as their strategy of running in small local elections on broadly popular platforms got them actual results. However, he is a well known optimist and frequently operates on the assumption that people's better natures will always win out.

They fired a hellacious amount of missiles and caused only periodic blackouts.

            "body": "I think you're starting from some mistaken assumptions.\n\nFirst of all there's a continuum between HEAT and EFP. Both depend on the munro effect. What makes the distinction is the angle of the conical liner and secondarily the materials use. The point of EFP is to travel a non trivial distance from the source object, which is why it's so common with fixed position mines/IEDs. EFPs are not kinetic penetrators in the same sense as APFSDS rounds, and against an inert target more jet like behavior will have \\*far\\* superior penetration. How each end of this continuum interacts with ERA is a very complex question that can't be simply stated in either direction.\n\nRPG shells and similar use simple and reliable contact fuzes.

Both depend on the munro effect. What makes the distinction is the angle of the conical liner and secondarily the materials use. The point of EFP is to travel a non trivial distance from the source object, which is why it&#39;s so common with fixed position mines/IEDs. EFPs are not kinetic penetrators in the same sense as APFSDS rounds, and against an inert target more jet like behavior will have *far* superior penetration.
