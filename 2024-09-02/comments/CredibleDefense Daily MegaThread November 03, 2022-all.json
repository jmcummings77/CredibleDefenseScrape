They traveled to Kyiv (stopping in Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel while there), then South to Odesa, over to Mykolaiv, then the Kherson frontlines, then out through Kryvyi Rih back to Kyiv. \n\n- They started out discussing the first days of the war and how tenuous the situation really was. Defense of Kyiv in the first week or so was almost totally ad hoc, with armed volunteers doing most of the heavy lifting and difficulty communicating between forces. There was some artillery support for these forces, but the Ukrainian military was caught with their pants down and the tenacity of these irregular forces is the only thing that held Irpin, and prevented the collapse of Ukrainian forces around the capital. Guess that explains why Western experts saw a rapid collapse of Kyiv as likely. \n\n- Also interesting to note is that there were a LOT of Ukrainian collaborators with Russia in place around Kyiv, they had numerous safehouses in the area with weapons and equipment prestocked. These collaborators were seen directly coordinating with Russian forcss on the ground. This is likely why Russia thought it would be able to win with its blyatskrieg thunderruns strategy. \n\n- In terms of the current conditions, Ukrainian morale on the frontlines is high, but the battle for Kherson is tough going for Ukraine. They noted that Russia is clearly not out of ammunition in this region as some have claimed, though it is constrained, and they believe that there is at least parity in artillery between Russia and Ukraine, if not an outright Ukrainian advantage in fires. They gave anecdotal evidence from their trip when Ukrainian forces pounded Russian positions with everything they had for a day, and the Russians were silent for 2 days after that. \n\nThere was more that they covered, but these are the things that stood out to me the most. Highly recommend giving it a listen if you can.\n\nEdit: actually one more bit I just remembered that I should note. Apparently the Ukrainians are desperately seeking Western tanks, especially Leopards, because they're low on ammunition for their current tank fleet. It's not as pressing as the need for Western artillery ammunition was earlier in the war, but its a long term issue that is getting worse.",

When EMD pulled out to reinforce Kherson and Zapo. oblasts back in late July/early August, they still had two MDs in the overall area commanding the CAA//GTA/AC. However, with the removal of EMD, then WMD controlled all the way from Kharkiv to Izyum. Its possible the deputy commander of WMD was in command of that HQ, though also possible he took orders from Lapin as he was junior. \n\nHowever, if there is a theater level commander (and intel points to there being one since April), its likely the theater commander was directly overseeing the MDs responsible for each of their sectors of the Donbas front, running that offensive as well as the overall theater. When the EMD detached to the Kherson/Zapo front area and reinforced the SMD, it gave a MD control of the Kherson bridgehead and immediately east while another MD controlled the Zapo. oblast area of operations, with both also reporting directly to the overall theater commander.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Surovkin is the overall theater commander now, and is implementing his terror bombing strategy in Syria, although there are some doubts on whether he can really do it at scale\n\nI think that had less to do with Surovkin than Putin needing to appear strong and react to both the Kharkiv defeat as well as the Kerch Bridge strike. Its not only a strategic bombing campaign, there is also mobilization plus the annexation of Russian controlled territory, all of which were steps that there is no real easy way to come back from. And all coming from Putin. \n\nRussian military view terrorism as a working strategy, for basic governance and military campaigns. Is something the Soviet state especially liked and later the Russians firmly believe works too. They view it as acceptable, another tool in the toolbox. In Syria, more so, terrorism was also a key component of the Assad govt's overall strategy to prosecute the civil war, they were using terrorism against their own people too, so when the Russians started their air campaign they simply continued an existing strategic theme on a larger scale and doing it from the air, which the various insurgent groups couldn't counter. \n\nSurovkin ran the air war, but I seriously doubt he's some nefarious mastermind, its not like it requires some sort of special thinker to do what Russians have done in pretty much every war they've fought in modern history.",

Were some advantages missing previously?\n\n1\\. Link 16 is an older, non-LPI (low probability of intercept) datalink. In particular, it's omnidirectional, whereas many other newer systems use beamforming or other techniques to create a highly directional signal that's pointed only at the intended recipient (in addition to other LPI techniques). Anyone that can detect the Link 16 signal can potentially locate the transmitter using radio direction finding, multilateration, or other similar techniques.\n\n2\\. The core issue is that the F-22 and F-35 both use proprietary LPI datalinks, IFDL (intra-flight datalink) and MADL (multifunction advanced datalink), respectively. These are not compatible with each other, and would likely require hardware upgrades to do so. This would require significant expense and, in the case of the F-22, would be particularly difficult as it has no extra room for new electronics. They've already been struggling to fit in hardware for other upgrades, like the IRST system and helmet mounted display that the USAF has been wanting for a while.\n\nThe U-2 has a highly modular system for fitting different electronics and other hardware for different missions. Much of this is pod-based, which allows for rapid swapping. It's a convenient platform, although by no means is this datalink capability unique to the U-2. The E-8 and E-11 have also been used to \"interpret\" incompatible types of datalinks, as have drones.\n\n3\\. There has been some testing regarding transmitting Link 16 on the F-22, but the last that I saw was that it was not an operational capability, and that operational aircraft were still receive only.\n\n4\\. They're rather secretive about the details of this type of stuff, but here's a rough overview of how datalinks currently work with these two missiles, and where this new integration may provide additional capabilities. This is also a bit of a simplification as this is a very complex topic. These capabilities can be roughly split into two categories: lock on after launch, which allows the launching aircraft to send updated targeting data to the missile to hit targets that are not within the seeker's field of view at launch, and cooperative engagement, which allows another aircraft to provide updated targeting data until the missile acquires it's target so that the launching aircraft doesn't have to maintain a track with their radar (or other sensor).\n\nFor the sidewinder, this is mostly for very high off boresight targets at close range.\n\nFor the AMRAAM, both capabilities are more extensively used. In the course of a normal engagement, the launching aircraft will have to provide continuous targeting data to the missile until it's fairly close to it's target, as the radar seeker head in the missile has a range shorter than the missile's maximum kinetic range. As far as I know, \"conventionally\" this targeting data is transmitted to the missile by radar of the launching aircraft, not through Link 16 (although aircraft can share targeting data among the aircraft through Link 16, and can use this to launch/guide AMRAAMs without having a radar track themselves). Cooperative engagement adds the capability for the launching aircraft to disengage and turn away from the target, while another aircraft guides the missile until its own seeker head has acquired the target. I suspect this is where these capabilities tie in: either in guiding missiles launched by other aircraft, or by passing targeting data to/from other aircraft, allowing others to launch missiles without having a radar track of their own.",

Israel committed to help Ukraine develop an early-warning system, similar to one that alerts Israelis to incoming fire from the Gaza Strip. \n\n>Gantz also agreed to assess Ukraine\u2019s air-defense alert needs, though Israel is declining to provide Ukraine the means to shoot down incoming drones and missiles. \n\n>\u201cThese are weapons that we have to be prepared to confront -- we are the only country in the world that knows how to do that,\u201d said Yossi Kuperwasser, a former top Israeli military intelligence official. \u201cUkraine can be a testing ground for our counter-measures.\u201d\n\n>While former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to return to power after winning elections on Nov. 1, an Israeli government led by him won\u2019t have significantly different security priorities from the current administration, Kuperwasser said.\n\n> In another new development, Israel has begun to share its intelligence, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Oct. 26, welcoming what he called a \u201cpositive\u201d trend. \u201cI am pleased with the last few days, we started working,\u201d he told reporters, citing information shared by Israel that he said confirmed Ukrainian intelligence.\n\n>\u201cThe Iranian collaboration with Russia was a big shift for us,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Israel, Yevgen Korniychuk, said at his country\u2019s embassy in Tel Aviv last week. \u201cWe\u2019d hoped Israel would choose to be on the right side of the war as a democratic country. But in the end, it happened because we have the same enemy, which is Iran.\u201d\n\n>Spokespeople for Gantz and the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office declined to comment for this story. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry and the foreign ministry in Tehran didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\n>Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, said Ukraine needs help as soon as possible to counter Iranian weapons. He said Reznikov had requested air-defense support on the call with Gantz.\n\n>>Battle Tested\n\n>Russia in the past few weeks escalated its attacks on Ukraine after suffering a series of battlefield setbacks in its eight-month offensive, unleashing a blitz aimed at knocking out Ukrainian electricity, heating and other infrastructure ahead of the winter months. Ukrainian officials say 40% of the power system has been damaged. \n\n>Relying increasingly on Iranian drones as it burns through its own stockpiles of precision-guided missiles, Russia\u2019s attacks aim to create enough hardship for the population to persuade Kyiv to sue for peace, Ukrainian officials say.\n\n> Russia denies using Iranian equipment, and Iran denies supplying it. \n\n>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been more equivocal, acknowledging in a speech last month that the world was concerned about Iran selling drones and boasting about them being looked upon as \"dangerous.\u201d\n\n>Remnants of Iranian drones -- rebranded Geran-2 by Russia -- have been found after being shot down over Ukraine.\n\n> Israel has been reluctant to get more involved because of fear that antagonizing Moscow could have direct security implications in the Mideast and for Russian Jews. Israel routinely carries out strikes over Syria in areas where Russia has control over airspace, to stop Iran from supplying its proxies there. \n\n>There are an estimated one million Jews living in Russia whose safety is also a concern, especially with Russia-Israel relations at their worst in years. In July, Russian authorities set off alarms in Israel when they asked a Moscow court to liquidate the local offices of the Jewish Agency, which helps Jews emigrate, for alleged violations of Russian law.\n\n> But the mass strikes on Ukrainian targets with Iranian drones and expected provision of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia have changed Israel\u2019s calculations, with concern growing that the Ukrainian experience could allow Iran to hone its capacity to attack Israeli cities.\n\n>Israel so far has only provided Ukraine with humanitarian assistance and defensive equipment such as helmets and protective vests. For an early-warning system based on Israeli designs, its radar technology and software would have to be used, according to former and current Israeli officials. The sale of such technologies requires export authorization, which is a complex process involving a number of ministries, including the defense ministry.\n\n>> Risk of Retaliation\n\n\n>Russia has informed Israel that it will retaliate if Israeli-made air-defense missiles or other interceptors get to Ukraine, whether directly or via third countries, according to two people with knowledge of Russian policy. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior security official, warned Israel last month against providing arms to Ukraine, saying that such a step would be \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d ties between Russia and Israel. \n\n>\u201cThe real question is how to do it in a way that isn\u2019t provocative for the Russians,\u201d Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which lobbies for stronger measures to counter Iran, said in an interview in Tel Aviv. \n\n>Israel could supply anti-drone and anti-missile equipment to other countries assisting Ukraine, in turn allowing those third countries to provide more of their own arsenals to Kyiv, said Amir Avivi, a former brigadier general in the Israeli army.\n\n>\u201cFor example if you sell it to Germany and then Germany delivers another set of weapons, it\u2019s not Israeli, no problem,\u201d he said.\n\n>>Drone Swarms\n\n\n>Iran has mostly supplied Russia with the Shahed-136 single-use so-called \u201csuicide drones,\u201d which are difficult to detect because they\u2019re relatively small and low-flying. Recently upgraded with commercial GPS systems, they can loiter for hours before locking onto a target. Iran delivered 1,000 of them in August, according to the US, and plans to deliver 2,400 eventually, Ukraine says.\n\n>Drones based on Iranian technology have also been used in attacks on Saudi oil facilities and the United Arab Emirates, as well as in a reconnaissance mission Lebanese militia Hezbollah was attempting over a gas rig in the Mediterranean in July, according to the US and its allies. Israel shot down all three drones approaching the rig.\n\n>Ukraine intercepts 70% or more of the drones, but when used in swarms, shooting them down becomes increasingly difficult. Produced at a cost of $20,000 each, according to Western defense experts, the air-defense missiles used to intercept them often cost multiples more. On October 17, an Iranian drone slammed into a four-story apartment block in Kyiv, killing five people.\n\n> For Israel, even though its so-called Iron Dome System has a good track record of halting short-range rocket attacks by Palestinian militant groups and the Iranian-allied Hezbollah, the new mass drone tactics used by Iran represent an unprecedented challenge, said Avivi, the ex-general, who now heads an association of former and reserve members of the security forces. \n\n>\u201cImagine 100 suicide drones crossing the Israeli border toward the port of Haifa. As good as our air defense is, it would take 90 out of 100, still 10 will hit. It\u2019s a big threat,\u201d he said.\n\n>>Shadow War\n\n\n>A shift in the Ukraine war into a proxy competition between Iranian and Israeli capabilities expands the shadow conflict the two countries have been fighting for years.\n\n>\u201cThe Iranian weapons have been effective on the ground because they\u2019re causing damage and it\u2019s also a great way for Iran to show it\u2019s working with Russia and isn\u2019t isolated,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, an analyst from the International Crisis Group in Brussels.\n\n> Tehran has agreed to send surface-to-surface missiles to Russia and, as soon as November, the Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar rockets, which are capable of striking targets from a range of 300 to 700 kilometers (180 to 420 miles), could be in use, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone published Oct. 28.\n\n>Russia\u2019s growing dependence on Iran\u2019s military potential in Ukraine is also fanning Israeli concerns that Tehran in return could seek Russian assistance with its nuclear program. Israel rejects Iran\u2019s assertions that the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and says it will take any steps necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a bomb.",

It\u2019s a big threat,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shadow War</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A shift in the Ukraine war into a proxy competition between Iranian and Israeli capabilities expands the shadow conflict the two countries have been fighting for years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Iranian weapons have been effective on the ground because they\u2019re causing damage and it\u2019s also a great way for Iran to show it\u2019s working with Russia and isn\u2019t isolated,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, an analyst from the International Crisis Group in Brussels.</p>\n\n<p>Tehran has agreed to send surface-to-surface missiles to Russia and, as soon as November, the Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar rockets, which are capable of striking targets from a range of 300 to 700 kilometers (180 to 420 miles), could be in use, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said in an interview with The War Zone published Oct. 28.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s growing dependence on Iran\u2019s military potential in Ukraine is also fanning Israeli concerns that Tehran in return could seek Russian assistance with its nuclear program. Israel rejects Iran\u2019s assertions that the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and says it will take any steps necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a bomb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

If it can't invade anyone it can't defend either, IT'S THE SAME ARMY.\n\nNo, it doesn't. Limited offensive capability does not prevent strong defensive capability. A state can be forced to concede it is not capable of pressing an offensive while at the same time maintaining a resolute defense. In fact, given what we know about the situation in Ukraine right now, I would argue that this is essentially where we are at.

Limited offensive capability does not prevent strong defensive capability. A state can be forced to concede it is not capable of pressing an offensive while at the same time maintaining a resolute defense. In fact, given what we know about the situation in Ukraine right now, I would argue that this is essentially where we are at.

After many months of growing frustration with seeing this as the norm in this megathread especially, hence my snide comments. \n\nAnd the funny thing is I don't even have a problem at all with what Austin stated (though it was necessary to say it publicly), it's clear as day the US is using this war to gut Putin's Russia, going after it's military and destroying their society with sanctions. Considering what they did, they deserve it. My issue is people not being honest about that because they want to maintain some sort of moral high ground.",

And the Russians aren&#39;t even unique about that, because capabilities to conduct defensive ops aren&#39;t much different than offensive.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just because people do not agree with your interpretation of what is essentially one statement from one official months ago doesn&#39;t mean that everyone else is stupid, so don&#39;t treat them as such.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has nothing to do with Austin at this moment, it&#39;s about posters not knowing how armies work, while still arguing endlessly, all happening in a sub called credibledefense. After many months of growing frustration with seeing this as the norm in this megathread especially, hence my snide comments. </p>\n\n<p>And the funny thing is I don&#39;t even have a problem at all with what Austin stated (though it was necessary to say it publicly), it&#39;s clear as day the US is using this war to gut Putin&#39;s Russia, going after it&#39;s military and destroying their society with sanctions. Considering what they did, they deserve it. My issue is people not being honest about that because they want to maintain some sort of moral high ground.</p>\n</div>",

Everyone strongly suspected all of this already, there is no reason to confirm it, especially due to threat of escalation (tit for tat) and it can feed enemy propaganda who then have direct sound bytes.\n\nI also have no issues with proxy wars in general, they're a safe way to hurt enemies without the risk of actually being a belligerent in a conflict, which especially needs to be avoided in this war due to nuke threat. I'd rather support a proxy war than an outright war with US forces involved.\n\nAFAIK, Russia has been promoting the narrative that this isn't a war against Ukraine, it's actually a war against NATO. They already report US and other Western advisors and SOF actually fighting in Ukraine (using Int'l Legion as evidence), and then they use things like various western media articles or interviews by senior govt officials who basically confirm it's a proxy war.

Everyone strongly suspected all of this already, there is no reason to confirm it, especially due to threat of escalation (tit for tat) and it can feed enemy propaganda who then have direct sound bytes.</p>\n\n<p>I also have no issues with proxy wars in general, they&#39;re a safe way to hurt enemies without the risk of actually being a belligerent in a conflict, which especially needs to be avoided in this war due to nuke threat. I&#39;d rather support a proxy war than an outright war with US forces involved.</p>\n\n<p>AFAIK, Russia has been promoting the narrative that this isn&#39;t a war against Ukraine, it&#39;s actually a war against NATO. They already report US and other Western advisors and SOF actually fighting in Ukraine (using Int&#39;l Legion as evidence), and then they use things like various western media articles or interviews by senior govt officials who basically confirm it&#39;s a proxy war.

We don't need other people's territories, we have plenty of everything. But there is our land, which is sacred for us, where our ancestors lived and where our people live today.

They are a bunch of insane Nazi drug addicts, a nation drugged and intimidated by them, and a large pack of barking dogs from the Western kennel. With them is a motley pack of grunting gilts and small-minded philistines from a collapsed western empire with drool dripping down their chins from degeneration. They have no faith and no ideals except their own made-up obscene habits and their own two-worldly standards of thought that deny the morals granted to normal people.

Many countries have long disbelieved their delusions, but are still afraid of them. Soon they too will finally wake up. And when the decrepit world order collapses, it will bury all its haughty priests, bloodthirsty followers, sneering servants and voiceless mankurts under the thick of its rubble.\n\nWhat are our weapons? Weapons come in many forms. We have the ability to send all enemies to hellfire, but that is not our task. We listen to the words of the Creator in our hearts and obey them.

Which led to a diversion of forces from the Kharkiv fronts, opening the road to success in the east.\n\nThe southern summer counteroffensive was advertised in \"the South\" to liberate \"the Coast.\" The only \"broadcast\" coming from a specific member of the UA govt that mentioned Kherson City specifically was a call for Ukraine noncombatants in the city and everywhere else to retreat into Crimea if necessary to escape the battle. Plus they had the Melitopol partisans go kinetic with numerous attacks. \n\nThat caused the Russians to reinforce Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts (though the UAF even went so far as taking out the Antonovsky Bridge to try to stop those reinforcements from reaching the Kherson bridgehead). I think that makes it clear where the UA wanted the Russians to go, basically camp out near Melitopol (which is why there still hasn't been an attack directed against that location, that was the actual deception area).\n\nThat telegraphing by the UA govt can be viewed as necessary for numerous reasons (try to prevent planned referendum, let the West know, motivate UA depressed after losing Luhansk, etc), but it might also have been done to try to bait the Russians to reinforce the region to try to weaken the Russian offensive in the Donbas. \n\nHowever, the UAF would not have known beforehand the Russians would specifically weaken one specific sector in particular by stripping forces only from that area of operations around Balakliya to the Izyum axis while not changing anything else, not even halting offensive operations in the Izyum axis despite significantly weakening themselves, not even leaving an operational reserve in their rear to cover their weak, thin front lines covered by paramilitaries who had no business being on the front lines, which was a totally stupid and irrational decision. \n\nWhat happened was the UAF got even more than they asked for. The reinforcement of the South didn't just weaken Russian forces in the manner they were conducting their offensive (especially weakening the push against the Siversk-Bakhmut line), it left a giant gaping weak point that OC-E found, likely in early to mid August and planned an offensive to exploit. A led to B which led to C, it worked because the Ukrainians were flexible and smart, and the Russians were too aggressive and foolish.\n\nThis series of events is similar to OP Cobra, leading to the Breakout in Normandy. That should have triggered a German retreat to the Seine but instead they staged a foolish counteroffensive, OP Luttrich. That drove the Germans into an even worse position, culminating in the Falaise Encirclement, a major German defeat.

If there was a retreat being planned or even conducted, and the Ukrainians knew and were planning to stop it, would it be better to tip off the Russians by openly confirming they know it's happening? Or keep the Russians guessing?\n\nThere is a time to be truthful to your enemy. After the war ends, when you admit all the times you screwed them over while lying, just to rub it in their faces.",

A led to B which led to C, it worked because the Allies were flexible and smart, and the Germans were too aggressive and foolish.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>there isn\u2019t an incentive to lie about it compared to the one when preparing for the Kharkiv offensive</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure there is. If there was a retreat being planned or even conducted, and the Ukrainians knew and were planning to stop it, would it be better to tip off the Russians by openly confirming they know it&#39;s happening? Or keep the Russians guessing?</p>\n\n<p>There is a time to be truthful to your enemy. After the war ends, when you admit all the times you screwed them over while lying, just to rub it in their faces.</p>\n</div>",

But first things first - you think the Israeli pullout from Gaza was a disaster? When it allows Israel to preserve its Jewish majority, even after it annexes the West Bank?

She instead thanked congressional leaders for bipartisan work to \u201csupport Ukraine to defend itself from Russia\u2019s war crimes and atrocities.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe will continue to work with Congress and continue to monitor those conversations on these efforts and support Ukraine as long as it takes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are going to keep that promise that we\u2019re making to the brave Ukrainians who are fighting every day, to fight for their freedom and their democracy.\u201d\n\n> In private, GOP lawmakers who support aid to Ukraine say there could be an opportunity to pass one more tranche in an end-of-year spending package, before Republicans potentially take control in the next Congress.\n\n> Last month, lawmakers approved about $12.3 billion in Ukraine-related aid as part of a bill that finances the federal government through Dec. 16. The money included aid for the Ukrainian military as well as money to help the country\u2019s government provide basic services to its citizens.\n\n> That comes on top of more than $50 billion provided in two previous bills.\n\n> Financial support for Ukraine garnered strong bipartisan support in the Senate and the House after Russia\u2019s invasion in the spring. In the Senate, GOP leader Mitch McConnell and Richard Shelby, the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, were early and consistent voices for Ukraine aid. But conservative opposition was present from the start. Republicans accounted for the only votes against a $40 billion aid package in the spring.\n\n> Nearly 60 House members and 11 senators opposed the legislation, citing the need for more oversight of how the money is spent and what weapons and equipment the U.S. is sending overseas.\n\n> Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he will be leading that effort to provide more oversight of how the Ukraine money is spent if the GOP does win the majority next month.\n\n> \u201cI do think you have broad bipartisan support for what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, but I think you\u2019ll see, if we get the majority, more oversight and accountability in terms of the funding and where the money\u2019s going, and I think the American taxpayers deserve that,\u201d the Texas Republican told Bloomberg Business on Tuesday.\n\n> International allies are also watching the debate on Capitol Hill closely. Estonian Ambassador to the U.S. Kristjan Prikk said he\u2019d received assurances from members of both parties that there is \u201cstrong core support\u201d for Ukraine assistance to continue, no matter which party wins the election.\n\n> \u201cCertainly both parties have members who have doubted if the assistance is proportional, whether it\u2019s been necessary, but they did not constitute the majority or core,\u201d Prikk said Tuesday. \u201cI do not see this changing.\u201d\n\n\nThe article provided a balanced take, but if the Republicans do end up winning the mid-terms, does this mean Ukraine would get screwed over? Can they really be trusted to ensure continued support for Ukrainian counteroffensives to successfully repel the Russian invasion?",
