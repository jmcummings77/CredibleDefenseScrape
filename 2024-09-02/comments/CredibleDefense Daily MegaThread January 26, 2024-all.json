Why? Because ASML received permission from the Dutch government to sell massive quantities of highly sensitive equipment to Chinese companies before key restrictions on said equipment came into effect.

A military component\u2019s Instagram account can post recruiting advertisements but will fail to engender trust with its audience due to being a faceless organization. Despite the public\u2019s distrust of government institutions, the public still very much trusts individuals, especially military service personnel. Consequently, the Defense Department should train, coordinate, and channel a network of individual military social media influencers to amplify key messaging across broad audiences and combat recruiting and retention challenges.</em></p>\n</div>",

I don't think it's naive of me to say exactly, but I do think that there's a bit of contradictory feelings that the West has towards Russia and China. We want to trade with them, but we also need them to stop their tomfoolery that they're up to. So while we want them to do well, we want them to also not try and take chunks of their neighbors territories. \n\nUs trying to aid international shipping is a philosophical goal, us trying to still restrict access to high end chips is a realpolitik goal. \n\nAnd I think a big source of that contradiction is, again, the Wests desire to do good being weighed against countries that still act in uncouth ways. We wanted the Houthis to just stop, so we warned them and warned them and warned them and then resorted to bombing them. We wanted Russia to stop (2008, 2014) so we warned them and warned them and that was also proven ineffective. The west wants to stick to warnings, to be light handed, but at the end of the day if your \"opponent\" isn't playing ball, what can you do?",

We want to trade with them, but we also need them to stop their tomfoolery that they&#39;re up to. So while we want them to do well, we want them to also not try and take chunks of their neighbors territories. </p>\n\n<p>Us trying to aid international shipping is a philosophical goal, us trying to still restrict access to high end chips is a realpolitik goal. </p>\n\n<p>And I think a big source of that contradiction is, again, the Wests desire to do good being weighed against countries that still act in uncouth ways. We wanted the Houthis to just stop, so we warned them and warned them and warned them and then resorted to bombing them. We wanted Russia to stop (2008, 2014) so we warned them and warned them and that was also proven ineffective. The west wants to stick to warnings, to be light handed, but at the end of the day if your &quot;opponent&quot; isn&#39;t playing ball, what can you do?</p>\n</div>",

The war in Ukraine only slightly increases the risk of such an incident over a high tension time of piece. As for the situation in the Middle East, the Syrian civil war is not at risk of expanding. All the current combatants have more or less exhausted themselves after roughly a decade of warfare. The biggest risk to the Turks is that some terrorist attack may draw them further into anti Kurdish actions and an occupation of further territory.

That's not taking into account the massive inflation since then. $900M for the tanks.\u00a0\n\n\nRussia was buying BMP-3 in 2019 for $1.3M. $390M to replace the IFV's (BMP-2 no longer in production).\n\n\nThat's not counting the logistics costs, the cost of human capital, compensations for soldiers and families, radars, AA systems, sanctions costs, other misc. equipment ect.\u00a0\n\n\nWar is incredibly expensive on a good day, and those seem to be far and few in between for Russia. This was a war at their chosen location, at their chosen time, entirely due to their own decision. They had Ukraine surrounded from the west (Transnistria and Belarus), south (Crimea), north and east. They had a massive advantage in both manpower and technology, not to mention they are orders of magnitude more important in the global economy.\u00a0\n\n\nAdiivka is a couple of kilometers from Donetsk City. It's essentially a suburb.\u00a0\n\n\nImagine if we were arguing whether we underestimated the US army as after two years of fighting and massive casualties, they managed to capture a Taco Bell and Wendy's in Tijuana.\u00a0\n\n\nDespite the numbers (costs and attrition) looking bleak for Russia, if there's anything we've learned so far, it's that we can't simply extrapolate everything based on numbers. Ukraine would not be in it's current position if that was the case.\u00a0",

As far as I read from some Ukrainian online articles, exemptions for students, caregivers, parents of 3+ children, etc. will be maintained. I take this with a grain of salt though, as these are analyses of the provisional version of the law, which may perhaps change before the final vote. It seems that the disabled in the lower category (the third one) will continue to be exempt and members of the Ministry of the Interior and therefore law enforcement (police officers, employees of the State Emergency Service, etc.) will not be mobilized (unlike what was rumoured), while there was talk of mobilization of those employed in the Ministry of Defense (I imagine the civilian workers?). The law allowing the mobilization of 25/26-year-olds had already been passed but lacks Zelensky's signature, which may come. In general in Ukraine there are still people who have never been called up and there are still many active exemptions, which as we see are being removed very slowly, if at all. Possibly, if there are further problems with recruiting, some categories currently exempted might be called in the future. The registry of mobilizable people will be organized electronically and there will be serious penalties for ignoring the summon (jail, seizure of property and driver's license). According to the military observer Kovalenko, Ukraine could have the capacity to mobilize between 40 and 50 thousand people per month. Of course, that is a very large number, but there is still a large pool of uncalled men. At the moment the priorities in Ukraine is to make this vast mass of people, the vast majority of whom continue to live the same life as always, understand that the war is also about them and is still an existential one, and at the same time some soldiers and officers themselves criticize the excessive methods employed by some territorial recruiting centers and say that the best way to get soldiers is by motivating people, providing good training and equipment, removing incompetent officers, always putting soldiers' lives first, avoiding \"meat assaults\", etc. All of these things are indeed commendable.\n\nEarlier I listened to an interview with Lieutenant Colonel Mykhailo Nikolov from the 68th Jager Brigade. He says that in his opinion there is a need for a \"total\" mobilization of both men and women from the age of 18, not for first line roles but still for support roles in the rear, logistics, defense industries, reservists, etc. In broad strokes this coincides with the thinking of the Ukrainian General Staff - I had read that there are plans to replace the current (and usual) military service with 3 months of training for both males and females in the 18-25 age bracket. This does not mean that they will be sent to the front or anything, but it's also to raise awareness of the war in the younger segments of the population, and to have people already trained, whether in the future they decide to lower the mobilization age further (as several Ukrainian officers would like, arguing that 22-25 year olds are the best soldiers and shoud be called up). \n\n\n\nAnother matter the Lt. Colonel raised concerns the use of convicts, which according to him represents one of the priorities at the moment. He said the UAF need to be tougher on this issue and not have issues with using convicts as stormtroopers or sappers for fortifications-building work or demining, on a voluntary basis. There have been cases of convicts being enlisted, but in general it's still rare as a thing. Many convicts are prohibited from enlisting in addition to being exempt from mobilization. Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) visited several penal colonies and testified that there are numerous cases of convicts asking to be enlisted to help their country. There are several issues, though. First, Zaluzhny is very much against it. Next, the number of Ukrainian inmates is much lower than Russia's. Last but not least, Ukraine lacks legislation both for the status of convicts once released from service (a special law needs to be made that would give them amnesty or something alike), and lacks (according to Lt. Colonel Nikolov too) military provisions that would allow for legal strict discipline against those convicts who disobey orders, run away, etc. At the moment, to my knowledge, the convicts fighting on the Ukrainian side are few and equated with regular soldiers, at most they are in the assault detachments of several units along with \"refuseniks\".",

Months ago i would have agreed but, now be it because of media, social media or ghost but denying aid to ukraine seems like a popular mainstream position in the republican party and importantly house leadership (and presidential\\* candidate). Even with more seats i would guess that the freedom caucus + at least 50 or more congress members could hold the speaker hostage again - but of course i can't really know that for sure.\n\nAre you sure of the numbers supporting the \"vast majority\" claim?",

Probably because he very much wants dictatorial powers himself. \n\n>All Trump was trying to do is play up the idea that he is a peacemaker with Russia and North Korea whereas his opponents are war-makers.\n\nNo, he wasn't. He was explicitly disparaging his own intelligence agencies and siding with one of America's enemies, who was literally a KGB agent before becoming the undisputed ruler of Russia for the past 20 years.

Also UMPK glide bomb kits, almost forgot those.\n\nIf the Russians can mobilise and produce enough of those they will win, with or without 1,500 new tanks.

        "body": "As of lately it seems that the idea of a possible conflict between Russia and NATO in the Baltic region is again on the cards, here i explain why a Russian victory is extremely unlikely to happen  \n\n\nLet's start with the fact that currently, with the ongoing war in Ukraine, Russia absolutely does not have the forces to open a second front. Therefore, a possible attack could only occur if and when the war in Ukraine concludes, which is unlikely in the short term given Russia's determination to take control of the entire Donbass region, a goal they are far from achieving.\r  \n\r  \nEven with the end of the war in Ukraine, the Russian armed forces would find themselves in a pitiful state. Their better-trained and equipped forces would be buried between Hostomel, Vhuledar, Bakhmuth, Advika, and on the banks of the Siversky Donetsk. It would take years to rebuild armored forces to pre-February 2022 levels and likely decades to achieve the same levels of professionalism enjoyed by the Russian army.\r  \n\r  \nIn contrast, NATO forces have not lost an ounce of capability in their professional forces since NATO forces were not deployed in the conflict, except for a few volunteers in the foreign legion.\r  \n\r  \nNATO intelligence services have gained valuable information on the combat tactics of the Russian armed forces, information that the Russians cannot claim to have. While Ukrainian forces have been trained in NATO tactics, they lack the quantity of resources, especially aircraft, and their forces have not had the time to be trained as extensively as NATO soldiers. Therefore, it can be confidently said that the Russians have limited insight into how their adversaries will fight.\r  \n\r  \nNow, turning to the actual invasion, the Baltic's weak point, the Swali gap, has been known for at least 20 years. Therefore, the most obvious direction of attack would not be a surprise. Attacking this gap would mean assaulting many Polish locations, which is not easy given the Russian military's difficulty in quickly capturing urban centers. The capture of these centers, necessary for rejoining with Russian forces in the Kaliningrad enclave, would be a slow process, especially considering the numerous and well-equipped Polish armed forces.\r  \n\r  \nSpeed is the only thing that would allow the Russians to succeed in the Baltic, as NATO forces are superior technologically, in training, and in numbers. If a land communication line is not established rapidly before the arrival of the bulk of European armies, holding Kaliningrad is impossible.\r  \n\r  \nNow, considering the naval aspect of the war, frankly, the Russians have no hope.\r  \n\r  \nBaltic and North Fleets: 1 Aircraft Carrier (in refit since 2017 with many problems), 2 Battlecruisers, 1 Cruiser, 6 Destroyers, 5 Frigates, 33 Corvettes, 7 Ballistic Missile Submarines, 4 Cruise Missile Submarines, 7 Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarines, 5 Conventional Submarines.\r  \n\r  \nPolish Navy: 2 Frigates, 2 Corvettes, 1 Conventional Submarine.\r  \nFinnish Navy: 8 Corvettes (Rauma and Hamina classes, which the Finns call missile boats).\r  \nSwedish Navy: 7 Corvettes, 4 Conventional Submarines.\r  \nDanish Navy: 9 Frigates.\r  \nNorwegian Navy: 4 Frigates, 6 Corvettes, 6 Conventional Submarines.\r  \nGerman Navy: 7 Destroyers (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Sachsen classes, which the Germans call frigates), 4 Frigates, 5 Corvettes, 6 Conventional Submarines.\r  \nDutch Navy: 4 Destroyers (De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn class, which the Dutch call frigates), 2 Frigates.\r  \nBelgian Navy: 2 Frigates.\r  \nBritish Navy: 2 Aircraft Carriers, 6 Destroyers, 11 Frigates, 4 Ballistic Missile Submarines, 5 Conventional Submarines.\r  \n\r  \nTotal: 2 Aircraft Carriers, 17 Destroyers, 34 Frigates, 28 Corvettes, 4 Ballistic Missile Submarines, 22 Conventional Submarines.\r  \n\r  \nThese are just the forces immediately available to NATO, which could be reinforced by American, French, Italian, Spanish, etc., contingents. Additionally, the age of Russian major units, such as carriers battlecruisers and cruisers, commissioned in 1991, 1988, 1998, and 1986 respectively, contrasts with NATO's  more modern assets.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, Russian forces cannot rely on the Black Sea or Caspian Sea fleets, and the Pacific fleet would need to traverse the Pacific and face the vastly superior US Navy, to join the theater of operations. Adding to this, the proximity of the port of St. Petersburg (less than 200 km from the front) within the range of ATAMACS, Storm Shadow, Taurus, and other medium to long-range systems, and the even closer port of Kaliningrad, means that the Baltic Fleet will be in extremely perilous waters from the first minute of war with no escape route.\r  \n\r  \nThis implies that if the Blitz through the Swali Strait does not happen, Russian forces in Kaliningrad would be under siege, with naval resupply impossible and airborne resupply impractical due to NATO's air superiority and limited Russian logistical capabilities.\r  \n\r  \nIn essence, the Russians are being asked to do much more than they did in Ukraine against a vastly stronger opponent.\r  \n\r  \nIn short, a Russian victory relies solely on the Atlantic alliance not engaging in combat.",

Additionally, the age of Russian major units, such as carriers battlecruisers and cruisers, commissioned in 1991, 1988, 1998, and 1986 respectively, contrasts with NATO&#39;s  more modern assets.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Russian forces cannot rely on the Black Sea or Caspian Sea fleets, and the Pacific fleet would need to traverse the Pacific and face the vastly superior US Navy, to join the theater of operations. Adding to this, the proximity of the port of St. Petersburg (less than 200 km from the front) within the range of ATAMACS, Storm Shadow, Taurus, and other medium to long-range systems, and the even closer port of Kaliningrad, means that the Baltic Fleet will be in extremely perilous waters from the first minute of war with no escape route.</p>\n\n<p>This implies that if the Blitz through the Swali Strait does not happen, Russian forces in Kaliningrad would be under siege, with naval resupply impossible and airborne resupply impractical due to NATO&#39;s air superiority and limited Russian logistical capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, the Russians are being asked to do much more than they did in Ukraine against a vastly stronger opponent.</p>\n\n<p>In short, a Russian victory relies solely on the Atlantic alliance not engaging in combat.</p>\n</div>",
