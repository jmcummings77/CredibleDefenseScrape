The International Legion comes primarily from veterans who have served previously in western militaries. As combat experience was often a criteria in being accepted, many had served in the GWOT and maybe volunteered elsewhere (there seems to be a community of veteran adventurers, going from war to war volunteering in militaries that will have them to serve \"good causes\" as they see them). Fragging might have been something done in their military's past but not in recent generations, so it's a foreign concept.\n\nI'm not saying they're incapable of doing it but the reason \"fragging\" isn't common in modern wars fought by western countries is primarily it's a sign of major unit indiscipline, and most western militaries are rather well disciplined and haven't participated in conflicts where the situation has gotten bad enough for discipline to break down to that extent beyond the occasional rare instance. Not pervasive at all. Literally, fragging happens when discipline in a unit breaks down to the extent the troops murder their leader for whatever reasons. It's up there with mutiny as one of those things, that while it's fun to talk about, almost never happens because it's that big of a deal. Someone who's killed double or triple digits of their fellow man will often blanche at the thought of killing their own. It's very counterculture.\n\n2. They're volunteers, they can pretty much leave whenever. Even if they'd been told they're on fixed terms of service and can't leave, they can desert when they want (assuming they're smart about it), smuggle themselves to Poland and make it home. Even if they were stupid enough to give up their passports any consulate will still get them home, nobody is going to send them back to Ukraine against their will.\n\nIf nothing else they can transfer out of whatever \"shitshow\" unit they're in and find a new home, officially or just desert. That's another thing that seems to happen a lot within the foreign volunteers, they bounce around between units that will take them, Int'l Legion of the TDF, various militia groups turned National Guard (like Azov or Right Sector), serve in the UAF version of the GRU's special reconnaissance units acting as elite troops (basically become Spetsnaz), or somewhere involved with training, all looking for the best place that suits them and what they're looking for. \n\nSo why would someone coming from a military culture that doesn't do it, commit the ultra controversial act of murdering their superior when they don't even need to serve under that individual anymore?",

Not pervasive at all. Literally, fragging happens when discipline in a unit breaks down to the extent the troops murder their leader for whatever reasons. It&#39;s up there with mutiny as one of those things, that while it&#39;s fun to talk about, almost never happens because it&#39;s that big of a deal. Someone who&#39;s killed double or triple digits of their fellow man will often blanche at the thought of killing their own. It&#39;s very counterculture.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They&#39;re volunteers, they can pretty much leave whenever. Even if they&#39;d been told they&#39;re on fixed terms of service and can&#39;t leave, they can desert when they want (assuming they&#39;re smart about it), smuggle themselves to Poland and make it home. Even if they were stupid enough to give up their passports any consulate will still get them home, nobody is going to send them back to Ukraine against their will.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If nothing else they can transfer out of whatever &quot;shitshow&quot; unit they&#39;re in and find a new home, officially or just desert. That&#39;s another thing that seems to happen a lot within the foreign volunteers, they bounce around between units that will take them, Int&#39;l Legion of the TDF, various militia groups turned National Guard (like Azov or Right Sector), serve in the UAF version of the GRU&#39;s special reconnaissance units acting as elite troops (basically become Spetsnaz), or somewhere involved with training, all looking for the best place that suits them and what they&#39;re looking for. </p>\n\n<p>So why would someone coming from a military culture that doesn&#39;t do it, commit the ultra controversial act of murdering their superior when they don&#39;t even need to serve under that individual anymore?</p>\n</div>",

No fucking country, outside of Belgium, would put their young men irrevocably under a French commander because of French behavior and history. \n\nPutin humiliated Macron to his face before the war during press conferences; Macron ignored all western intelligence about the invasion then threw his security chief under the bus after he was... humiliated again and shown he was wrong.

They handed over French optics for Russian tanks. Literally handed them over, Russia now makes them. \n\nThey don\u2019t care for Ukraine, they consider Ukraine backwards and were trying to sell Ukraine wildly overpriced helicopters while Ukraine was at gunpoint - Ukraine was trying to use that sale to build an alliance with France.

At the moment I think it's extremely likely that all of them are true.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## With that said, there are still three obvious reasons to disregard them:\n\n1. Faking all or even a plurality of the calls might be hard, but faking some important calls is still a distinct possibility with relatively low risk. The possibility of external investigation to corroborate those claims and the questionable benefit to Ukraine given the apparent surplus of material makes me doubt this though. If the lie is big enough to be worth it it's big enough to get caught, basically.\n2.

That's not to say it hasn't turned into a major battle of significance, especially for demonstration of willpower, but it doesn't have much tactical or operational value anymore for the Russians and definitely not for Ukraine to hold for future offensive ops. \n\nWhen the Russians still wanted to take the Donbas, it meant eventually needing to take the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, but they were too heavily defended from a Russian southern facing advance from the Izyum axis; the Russians needed another axis to pressure Sloviansk in particular (it's the NE of the cities), which meant coming the from the east. Bakhmut was important for the Russians because it's the southern hinge of the Siversk-Bakhmut defensive line, which then goes to the southwest towards Avdiivka. Breaking through Bakhmut means the Ukrainians might need to fall back to the next major terrain feature for a defense line, formed on the line of three cities, the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka line. \n\nHowever, after the Kharkiv counteroffensive the Russians lost the Izyum axis so the only way to take Sloviansk-Kramatorsk and Donetsk oblast is through the more hardened route. On top of that, they're too weak to go on the offensive in that area.\n\nWhich is why the continued attack on Bakhmut is so confusing, it's a being done for either very stupid reasons (Wagner dick waving, Putin is stubborn and won't stop trying to take it despite no reason) or a legit reason (feint, to draw and fix the UAF so they can't be used to attack Svatove-Kreminna).",

Russian expansionism has been seen in Georgia and Ukraine, as well as in Belarus. It involves direct applications of violence against their neighbors to absorb their territory, or in the case of Belarus, essentially forcing the country to become a vassal state and using your security services to quash internal dissent against the ruling pro-Russian dictator. \n\nNATO on the other hand expands when nations *apply* to join it, and then every member state of NATO needs to approve of the application before formal accession takes place. It's extremely democratic and there's zero pressure placed on nations to get them to join. \n\nSo when people talk against \"NATO expansion\" what they're really saying is that they're upset to see nations that have a long and often negative history with Russia choosing to protect themselves from future invasion.",
