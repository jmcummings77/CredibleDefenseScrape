They&#39;re doing ok economically but the west has been doing ok without them for 40 years, their weird government structure means they can&#39;t have much cultural influence, and while they are a significant regional military power they&#39;re trapped in constant conflict with two others which, for different reasons, very much want them gone. &quot;Please take these nukes in exchange for normalized trade relations,&quot; is a rational play for them, so long as their program doesn&#39;t get so far along as to be an imminent threat.</p>\n</div>",

You gave me good things to ponder about.</p>\n</div>",

Working for someone and to be willing to kill (and die) for someone are two different things which is why power struggles are not just about numbers but also the level of dedication and loyalty that people have. Having 100 fanatical followers can mean more than 1 million ambivalent followers, since those 100 would be willing to put their life on the line and the 1 million will just go home when push came to shove. Not saying this is exactly what is happening, just things to consider.</p>\n</div>",

Mark Milley, traveled to a site near the Ukraine-Poland border on Tuesday and talked with his Ukrainian counterpart face to face for the first time \u2014 a meeting underscoring the growing ties between the two militaries and coming at a critical time as Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine nears the one-year mark.\n\n> Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met for a couple of hours with Ukraine\u2019s chief military officer, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, at an undisclosed location in southeastern Poland. The two leaders have talked frequently about Ukraine\u2019s military needs and the state of the war over the past year but had never met.\n\n> The meeting comes as the international community ramps up the military assistance to Ukraine, including expanded training of Ukrainian troops by the U.S. and the provision of a Patriot missile battery, tanks and increased air defense and other weapons systems by the U.S. and a coalition of European and other nations.\n\n> It also marks a key time in the war. Ukraine\u2019s troops face fierce fighting in the eastern Donetsk province, where Russian forces \u2014 supplemented by thousands of private Wagner Group contractors \u2014 seek to turn the tide after a series of battlefield setbacks in recent months.\n\n> Army Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for Milley, told two reporters traveling with the chairman that the two generals felt it was important to meet in person.

Mark Milley, traveled to a site near the Ukraine-Poland border on Tuesday and talked with his Ukrainian counterpart face to face for the first time \u2014 a meeting underscoring the growing ties between the two militaries and coming at a critical time as Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine nears the one-year mark.</p>\n\n<p>Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met for a couple of hours with Ukraine\u2019s chief military officer, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, at an undisclosed location in southeastern Poland. The two leaders have talked frequently about Ukraine\u2019s military needs and the state of the war over the past year but had never met.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting comes as the international community ramps up the military assistance to Ukraine, including expanded training of Ukrainian troops by the U.S. and the provision of a Patriot missile battery, tanks and increased air defense and other weapons systems by the U.S. and a coalition of European and other nations.</p>\n\n<p>It also marks a key time in the war. Ukraine\u2019s troops face fierce fighting in the eastern Donetsk province, where Russian forces \u2014 supplemented by thousands of private Wagner Group contractors \u2014 seek to turn the tide after a series of battlefield setbacks in recent months.</p>\n\n<p>Army Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for Milley, told two reporters traveling with the chairman that the two generals felt it was important to meet in person. The reporters did not accompany Milley to the meeting and, under conditions set by the military, agreed to not identify the military base in southeastern Poland where they were located.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese guys have been talking on a very regular basis for about a year now, and they\u2019ve gotten to know each other,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThey\u2019ve talked in detail about the defense that Ukraine is trying to do against Russia\u2019s aggression.

            "body": "I think ROK potentially acquiring nukes is a more long-term move against deterring China than NK. Right now I would say US security guarantees are iron clad and there is no scenario in which NK attacks SK and US doesn't get involved and that won't change with the upcoming elections either, regardless of who wins, but given the somewhat fickle chaotic nature of US politics and extreme divides on most minor issues, who knows if it won't inflict geopolitical issues as well (which I would say both parties right now only differ on details). So in a hypothetical scenario if in a few decades US withdraws its influence from the pacific then NK with a belligerent China behind its back becomes an existential problem for SK.\n\nI don't think SK truly fear NK nuclear capabilities or any capabilities for that matter. Their mic is extremely strong and is only going to get stronger, they have spy satellites pointed at NK at all times and no doubt by now have a detailed map of every military installation. We saw what a dozen himars accomplished in few months in a changing frontline and makeshift storages, what do people think will happen with a prepared 21st-century army and an opponent whose doctrine is stuck in the 50s and equipment in the 70s? No, I don't think NK is a threat to the south, and their capabilities are only going to get worse. But China is and if they were to repeat the same as Russia did in Donbas but on steroids, basically full military capabilities of PLA, then it puts SK in a really tough spot because they can't attack mainland China because China is a nuclear power. So to eliminate this possibility from ever becoming a reality nukes start to make sense, because nobody wants to get nuked.\n\nNow, this is a somewhat wild scenario, there is no possibility of this happening now or in a decade, US is a strong ally, SK is a major trading partner for China and Japan wouldn't like this at all. But if certain trends, like China getting more belligerent and US more isolationist (which was somewhat reversed by Ukraine war) were to continue then it could be a possibility in few decades. I don't exactly know how US could prevent SK from becoming nuclear but I don't think blackmailing them with pulling security guarantees is a good strategy. If I had to make a proposal, then it would be to start the process of creating a formal alliance, something akin to Nato in the pacific. Some immediate members come to mind (SK, Japan, Australia) and long term potential members too (Vietnam, Philippines, and of course Taiwan but that's a whole another can of worms). A more formal alliance would alleviate fears of US pulling out and even if they did, the members would have themselves which even without US would be quite formidable. Of course this idea has been thrown around a lot for a long time and hasn't happened for various reason, and I think SK is trying to force the issue. The geopolitical landscape is changing and a proactive administration should adapt with it, using reactive moves is going to work only for so long.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think ROK potentially acquiring nukes is a more long-term move against deterring China than NK. Right now I would say US security guarantees are iron clad and there is no scenario in which NK attacks SK and US doesn&#39;t get involved and that won&#39;t change with the upcoming elections either, regardless of who wins, but given the somewhat fickle chaotic nature of US politics and extreme divides on most minor issues, who knows if it won&#39;t inflict geopolitical issues as well (which I would say both parties right now only differ on details). So in a hypothetical scenario if in a few decades US withdraws its influence from the pacific then NK with a belligerent China behind its back becomes an existential problem for SK.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think SK truly fear NK nuclear capabilities or any capabilities for that matter. Their mic is extremely strong and is only going to get stronger, they have spy satellites pointed at NK at all times and no doubt by now have a detailed map of every military installation.

The geographical/infrastructure realities here are that this is a multi-decade/multi-billion infrastructure project. </p>\n\n<p>There is a whole continent in the way of &quot;just sending the EU gas to China&quot; that any new piepline would have to cross... and that pipeline would also, incidentally, be a 4000km long sitting duck for any sabotage Ukraine Intelligence is able to carry out in Russia.</p>\n</div>",

People who served in the army, and signed a contract to serve in the reserve. Take part in periodic training exercises, and get paid for it. They have a duty to show up at the conscription office without formal draft letter, a call from their commander is a sufficient binding summons.\n   * Second type: can be called \"passive reserve\". People who served in the army (contract or mobilization), preferably took part in the conflict during 2014-2015, but haven't signed the contract to serve in active reserve. The conscription office decides whether any given person can be added into passive reserve, this is not voluntary.\n* Mobilizational reserve: essentially all able-bodied men, and women who volunteered to register with the conscription office.\n\nNow to answer your question: people from \"active reserve\" were called up even before martial law was declared. Pretty much all of them are already in the army.\n\nPeople from \"passive reserve\" are the priority for call-up. Because they have recent-ish experience in the army, they technically require only a refresher course and can be sent to an active brigade quicker. Part of the reason the summons to the conscription office are given left and right is to verify whereabouts of these people, because nobody bothers to notify conscription office about their up-to-date residence and current health conditions.\n\nGeneral public, or \"mobilizational reserve\" do get called-up as well, but anecdotally with lower priority. Such people must receive \"sufficient training\" before they can be sent to the frontlines.\n\nSo, anybody can be conscripted currently, but the priority is given to people with recent military experience or that took part in the conflict before, and volunteers. People with no military experience can be mobilized as well, but this is less frequent.

The logic is compelling: we have spare tanks and Ukraine needs armour for the upcoming spring offensive, when the biting Eastern European winter gives way to more favourable fighting conditions. What is less compelling, however, is the argument that we should give Kyiv Challenger 2.\n> \n> The first problem is one of simple numbers. The Army currently fields 227 Challenger 2s, divided between three regiments, a training school, and platforms used as reserves or for parts. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, meanwhile, believes the country needs around 300 tanks. It does not take a mathematician to note that 227 is substantially less than 300, particularly given that nobody really wants to hand over Britain\u2019s front-line units. Instead, the Government intends to give 14 of the 79 platforms due to be mothballed as part of the Challenger 3 upgrade entering service in 2027. A lot is riding on other countries giving tanks, too.\n> \n> This brings us to the second problem: just because the tanks are mothballed, it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t need them. Most of the existing Challenger 2 platforms will be required for maintenance throughout Challenger 3\u2019s lifespan. The new elements of the Challenger 3 design are mainly in the turret and main gun; this gives a real advantage in maintenance, as most of the rest can be cannibalised from old Challenger 2 platforms when parts need replacing. It would be possible to circumvent this issue by purchasing our new fleet off the shelf, but that takes us to the third problem: the upgrade to Challenger 3 is set to cost \u00a3800\u2009million. Buying new platforms would increase the cost significantly.\n> \n> There are also real risks to operational security if British tanks fall into Russian hands. Each Challenger 2 is equipped with Dorchester armour \u2013 a classified build no other nation has access to \u2013 in addition to sensitive digitalised communications and sighting systems. Unless these systems are replaced, a difficult task, should a British tank be captured, classified British information intended for use in Challenger 3 would be in enemy hands. This is a threat too grave to bear.\n> \n> This complexity \u2013 the initial retrofitting, the training of Ukrainian tank crews, finding routes for maintenance and sustenance \u2013 makes it difficult to view the export of the Challenger 2 as viable, even for the resourceful and battle-hardened Ukrainians. Instead, we should look to a smarter option. The Kingdom of Jordan has recently retired its fleet of around 400 British Challenger 1 tanks. This is enough to supply Ukraine with the entire fleet it needs, and the essential spares for battlefield maintenance, without compromising sensitive technologies. It would also be inordinately cheaper for the UK to buy them on behalf of Kyiv.\n> \n> But the main benefit, again, is quantity, which retains a quality all its own. Realistically, any gift of Challenger 2s is likely to be too piecemeal to supply Ukraine with the support it really needs. But 400 British made Challenger 1s \u2013 long obsolete from British stocks and of no national security concern \u2013 would provide Ukraine with a ready-made tank division for the all-important spring offensive.\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/16/britain-sending-ukrainians-wrong-tanks/?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_youtube_youtube-community\n\nWould this even be possible and would Jordan be willing to transfer its tanks? Could the UK buy back its former tanks and give them to Ukraine?",

This is a threat too grave to bear.</p>\n\n<p>This complexity \u2013 the initial retrofitting, the training of Ukrainian tank crews, finding routes for maintenance and sustenance \u2013 makes it difficult to view the export of the Challenger 2 as viable, even for the resourceful and battle-hardened Ukrainians. Instead, we should look to a smarter option. The Kingdom of Jordan has recently retired its fleet of around 400 British Challenger 1 tanks. This is enough to supply Ukraine with the entire fleet it needs, and the essential spares for battlefield maintenance, without compromising sensitive technologies. It would also be inordinately cheaper for the UK to buy them on behalf of Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>But the main benefit, again, is quantity, which retains a quality all its own. Realistically, any gift of Challenger 2s is likely to be too piecemeal to supply Ukraine with the support it really needs. But 400 British made Challenger 1s \u2013 long obsolete from British stocks and of no national security concern \u2013 would provide Ukraine with a ready-made tank division for the all-important spring offensive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/16/britain-sending-ukrainians-wrong-tanks/?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_youtube_youtube-community\">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/16/britain-sending-ukrainians-wrong-tanks/?WT.mc_id=tmgoff_youtube_youtube-community</a></p>\n\n<p>Would this even be possible and would Jordan be willing to transfer its tanks? Could the UK buy back its former tanks and give them to Ukraine?</p>\n</div>",

Generally, things that can be measured and counted.\n\nBut there are others that he seems to gloss over: social organization, cultural myths (national foundation, religious).
