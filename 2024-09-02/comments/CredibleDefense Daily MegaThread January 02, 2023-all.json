I still don't understand why far-left and far-right are so in love with Putin.\n\nWe now take for granted that the western world is firmly behind Ukraine, but this wasn't given, in fact back in 2014 we were at best indifferent and at worst we kinda supported Putin and hated on \"nazi\" Ukrainians. It was not given that Ukraine would become such a media darling that it is today, is it because of Zelensky? Does it come to having a media-talented, brave, and likable president?\n\nI bet Putin is still in shock, in 2014 in Donbas he behaved no less despicably than now. For christ's sake, he shot down a western civilian airliner murdering all 298 people on board, and it didn't matter one bit, the west still kinda hated Ukrainians and we still refused to help them against the Russians.

Many seem weak to me but:\n\n- vehicle crews were supposed to be airlifted and joined with vehicles (to explain why many vehicles only had 2 men in them) differing on being infantry to fill out APCs or even the rest of a tank crew - I went with this here because it explains some big holes\n\n- wanting to reach objectives at the same time, to not cause people to disperse or move away from known locations\n\n- expected to disperse more, driving through mud etc. but got stuck and didn't... want to follow the highways?\n\n- soldiers sold everything before hand and ran out of fuel, with totally empty fuel trucks etc. Cf. discussions of rotting tires. Definitely happened, but that gets back to how little could be needed to shift the balance. \n\n- soldiers don't even know the plan.

But I still think that Russia spent a dollar to save a penny by not risking a much larger followup drop instead seeming to risk the whole op on some Spets and too few paratroopers. \n\nAnd i also wondered then and now about why the Infamous convoy was so roadbound. Back in the USSR days Im sure people would have been shot for that. Even on the most basic level, doctrine is clear. If the road is blocked you have to go around. This was the fundamental concept of Soviet manuals, you never stop moving. Why didnt the convoy switch to alternate roads? Or indeed pull infantry and armor off roads entirely, which is the whole point of a tracked platform. So what was the point of failure? Terrain and the fear of ambushes clearly must have played into the decision to maintain a compact fortified zone. But also there seems to have been a failure of vision. Either lower officers refused to think beyond the plan, or upper officers refused to approve actions beyond the plan. \n\nBut that seems to define the entire war. I get the strong sense generally that Moscow is dictating The Plan to the field forces. The field forces do not, or can not, deviate from The Plan, even if such a choice would ultimately fulfill the desired objectives. And so The Plan is all there is, no matter how unrealistic it is.",

Back in the USSR days Im sure people would have been shot for that. Even on the most basic level, doctrine is clear. If the road is blocked you have to go around. This was the fundamental concept of Soviet manuals, you never stop moving. Why didnt the convoy switch to alternate roads? Or indeed pull infantry and armor off roads entirely, which is the whole point of a tracked platform. So what was the point of failure? Terrain and the fear of ambushes clearly must have played into the decision to maintain a compact fortified zone. But also there seems to have been a failure of vision. Either lower officers refused to think beyond the plan, or upper officers refused to approve actions beyond the plan. </p>\n\n<p>But that seems to define the entire war. I get the strong sense generally that Moscow is dictating The Plan to the field forces. The field forces do not, or can not, deviate from The Plan, even if such a choice would ultimately fulfill the desired objectives. And so The Plan is all there is, no matter how unrealistic it is.</p>\n</div>",

Then they&#39;d fight auxiliaries etc. and keep getting more fuel trucked from the North.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A smaller corridor between the ATO through Dnipro and Zaporozha to the West allows some supplies through, but most of the transportation infrastructure is closed, even just by a battle in Kyiv not the city being taken. The loss of fuel and additional ammunition could starve the main army out within weeks</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, a few less trucks could hypothetically reduce throughput enough to starve out the ATO. Or some more could be enough to keep any of it from happening.</p>\n</div>",

Granted not in war zones but the same principles hold.\n\nTo answer your question in basic terms: yes, tourniquets can save limbs. The thing that kills you quickly with limb injuries or surgical intervention on such limbs is the blood loss. Tourniquets effectively drop blood flow to the affected limb to zero thus preventing hemorrhagic shock and death.\n\nYou are correct that eventually you will get ischemic injury from the lack of blood flow and oxygenation. What may surprise you is that we put tourniquets on for 60-90 minutes at a time with minimal effects on the limb long term. Honestly sometimes we even put a tourniquet up for 120 minutes. If a tourniquet is needed longer than that, then yes we'll bring the tourniquet down for 5-15 minutes to allow for tissue reperfusion and then bring the tourniquet back up. The limb and nerves can last for a lot longer than one might think and not die.\n\nReperfusion of limbs that have not had blood flow for a while, either because of a prolonged tourniquet coming off or because of revascularization of formerly occluded vessels, results in \"reperfusion syndrome\". This can also happen when you do an organ transplant since the donor organ has had no blood flow for a while. The syndrome results in a massive amount of \"bad blood\" from the formerly ischemic limb/organ rushing back into systemic circulation. This blood is hyperkalemic, hypoxic, hypercarbic, and acidotic. The sudden rush of such blood can cause instant cardiogenic shock from the right ventricle becoming stunned. This is why for massive revascularization, say with an open aortic abdominal aneurysm repair with cross clamping, we will pretreat the patient with calcium supplementation, hyperoxygenation, hyperventilation, and even intropic support such as with epinephrine. Those massive reperfusions can be very challenging. \n\nBut limb reperfusions tend to be very reasonable unless the ischemia is many, many hours long since the absolute volume that is ischemic is low compared to an aortic cross clamp case or an organ transplantation.",

Interestingly, the brain is the only tissue that undergoes liquefactive necrosis under hypoxic/ischemic conditions as opposed to coagulative necrosis that other body tissues experience when hypoxic/ischemic. Liquefactive necrosis from hypoxic/ischemic conditions is rapid cell death potentiated by the release of lysosomal enzymes into the environment when the cell dies. These enzymes are very good at degrading lipids, in which the brain is rich in, degenerating brain tissue much faster than other tissues. Coagulative necrosis would be what a limb would experience following the application of a tourniquet over a longer period time (several hours+).

        "body": "Would Leopard 1 be a good option for Ukraine? I think it might be, because of several factors:\n\n* Less escalatory (vs Leo2/Abrams) - it's a cold war era tank, and Ukraine has already been given Gepards with Leo 1 chassis, as well as contemporary soviet tanks (and other much more advanced weaponry).\n* Lighter weight - should be no problem for bridges or recovery vehicles.\n* As they're pretty old, there's little to no concern of reputational damage or technological secrets getting revealed when some of them will inevitably get destroyed and captured.\n* Availability - this is the biggest question, I don't know how many are available in decent condition. [Rheinmetall proposed](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rheinmetall-ready-supply-up-50-tanks-ukraine-newspaper-2022-04-11/) to send 50 Leo 1-s, so a least some of them are available to send(in a relatively short time), but I'm not sure how many usable/refurbishable ones are left in other countries.

I dont even think they'll suffer much from the increase in capital cost (that is, raising interest rates) since the USG is probably shoveling cash at them already for capital investments. So the question is how do you get top tier workers in a tight market? The answer is spending. In the DoD's favor though are big recent layoffs at Silicone Valley giants Facebook and Twitter. I doubt most of those people will slide over to LockMart, but if they slow down hiring it has knock on effects in the broader economy.

I dont even think they&#39;ll suffer much from the increase in capital cost (that is, raising interest rates) since the USG is probably shoveling cash at them already for capital investments. So the question is how do you get top tier workers in a tight market? The answer is spending. In the DoD&#39;s favor though are big recent layoffs at Silicone Valley giants Facebook and Twitter. I doubt most of those people will slide over to LockMart, but if they slow down hiring it has knock on effects in the broader economy. Near-recession conditions will, over time, balance out any short term pinch from rising costs.</p>\n</div>",
