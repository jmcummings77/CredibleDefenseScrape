It was compiled by a Mobile Justice Team, part of the UK, EU and US-sponsored Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA) and set up by international human rights law firm and foundation, Global Rights Compliance, to support Ukraine\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor General (OPG).\n\n**Of those victims, at least 43% explicitly mentioned practices of torture in the detention centers, citing sexual violence as a common tactic imposed on them by Russian guards, on both male and female prisoners**, with preliminary results showing military personnel were most likely to experience torture in the detention centers. One of the authors of the report says those with families in the military were also targeted.\n\n\u201cA lot is just punishment, and in, in addition to punishment for [their family member\u2019s] actual military service, it\u2019s also punishment, it seems for being a Ukrainian citizen really,\u201d Anna Mykytenko, senior legal adviser and Ukraine country manager for Global Rights Compliance told CNN.\n\nAccording to the report, at least 36 victims from the pool analyzed mentioned the use of electrocution during interrogations, often genital electrocution by Russian guards. Other victims mentioned threats of genital mutilation, and at least one victim was forced to witness the rape of another detainee by a foreign object covered in a condom.\n\n\u201cIn relation to men, it\u2019s more the majority of crimes is sexualized torture, and that\u2019s usually torture of genitalia so that\u2019s a form of punishment [for being Ukrainian] and kind of precludes them from having children,\u201d Mykytenko adds.\n\nThe report adds that suffocation, waterboarding, severe beatings and threats of rape were other techniques commonly used against victims by Russian guards in the Kherson torture chambers, according to the specialist unit. Mykytenko says these patterns of rape and torture point towards a Russian intent to eradicate Ukrainian identity.\n\n\u201cThere is sort of an intent to destroy or eliminate Ukrainian identity because in some cases, it can be seen that those caught or, sometimes almost hunted for, had Ukrainian flags or other state symbols,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Difficult crime to prove\u2019\n\nBarrister Wayne Jordash, managing partner and co-founder of Global Rights Compliance, shared a similar view.\n\n\u201cThe torture and sexual violence tactics the Office of the Prosecution is uncovering from the Kherson detention centres suggests that Putin\u2019s plan to extinguish Ukrainian identity includes a range of crimes evocative of genocide,\u201d he said in a statement accompanying the report. \u201cAt the very least, the pattern that we are observing is consistent with a cynical and calculated plan to humiliate and terrorise millions of Ukrainian citizens in order to subjugate them to the diktat of the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nMykytenko does believe some of the patterns seen in Kherson could eventually be considered genocidal, **though she acknowledges it is difficult to prove and requires further investigation.**\n\n\u201cThere are some indicators [of genocide]\u201d she says. \u201cGenocide is a very difficult crime to prove because of the special intent. It\u2019s rarely direct enough to be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt this early, but we are working to provide enough support for the Office of the Prosecutor General for them to be able to establish if the evidence supports this finding.\u201d\n\nMykytenko says these findings are just a preliminary analysis of some of the detention cases, which she says suggests cases of torture may have been even more prevalent that currently thought. She also says, Ukrainians in regions currently under Russian occupation may be subjected to harsher and more widespread torture.\n\n**\u201cBased on the trends that we saw that the longer the occupation was, the more severe are the crimes and the higher numbers of crimes were committed,\u201d** she explains, adding that Ukrainian advances on the frontline also intensified the use of torture. \u201cGiven the liberation of the parts of the Kherson region last year, I imagine that the there are some crimes committed in retaliation for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso maybe this year with the ongoing counter offensive,\u201d she adds, cautioning that on all of this, further investigation is needed.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied accusations of torture and human rights abuses in Ukraine despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, investigated, compiled and shared by international human rights organizations and news organizations.

At least not fully. Russia fundamentally holds a central trait from its Mongol overlord past. It is that Russia is a horde, not a state. Russia does not really have borders.

And the security forces are basically heavily armed police trying to keep the peace. Training focused on individual and collective skills involving patrolling neighborhoods or local rural areas on foot or vehicles, intelligence driven raids, setting up check points, village or neighborhood wise clearing operations (cordon and search), and sometimes city wide clearing operations. \n\nIt did not prepare either of them to fight a phase 3 insurgency, which is what happened in both Iraq and Afghanistan when we pulled out.

It was too short, standards were low (nearly anybody could attend, nobody was supposed to fail). It was very much \"check the block\", focused not on actually learning whatever it was, but checking off the training schedule to say you did it.

Almost no language training (fully reliant on interpreters, which isn't good). A lot of that was actually replicated with Ukraine, they're not getting trained by the best of the best, they are getting trained largely by the Army National Guard (and speaking as a former Guardsman myself, they're not that good). \n\nAll of this is my opinion not only based on my own time in Iraq, but having extensively studied the GWOT as a whole after my own service ended to try to better understand what happened.",

        "body": "The NYT published an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/us/politics/ukraine-troops-counteroffensive-training.html) today, detailing the *overall* lack of progress being made in terms of territorial gains with Ukraine's counteroffensive, thus far, from the perspectives of insiders, and foreign military analysts such as Kofman and Rob Lee. Below, I will post the parts that I find to be the most relevant, as well as some personal comments.\n\n> Equipped with advanced American weapons and heralded as the vanguard of a major assault, the troops became bogged down in dense Russian minefields under constant fire from artillery and helicopter gunships. Units got lost. **One unit delayed a nighttime attack until dawn, losing its advantage.** Another fared so badly that commanders yanked it off the battlefield altogether.\n\n[...]\n\n> Now the Western-trained Ukrainian brigades are trying to turn things around, U.S. officials and independent analysts say. Ukrainian military commanders have changed tactics, focusing on wearing down the Russian forces with artillery and long-range missiles instead of plunging into minefields under fire.

Below, I will post the parts that I find to be the most relevant, as well as some personal comments.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Equipped with advanced American weapons and heralded as the vanguard of a major assault, the troops became bogged down in dense Russian minefields under constant fire from artillery and helicopter gunships. Units got lost. <strong>One unit delayed a nighttime attack until dawn, losing its advantage.</strong> Another fared so badly that commanders yanked it off the battlefield altogether.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[...]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now the Western-trained Ukrainian brigades are trying to turn things around, U.S. officials and independent analysts say. Ukrainian military commanders have changed tactics, focusing on wearing down the Russian forces with artillery and long-range missiles instead of plunging into minefields under fire. A troop surge is underway in the country\u2019s south, with a second wave of Western-trained forces <strong>launching mostly small-scale attacks to punch through Russian lines.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[...]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe counteroffensive itself hasn\u2019t failed; it will drag on for several months into the fall,\u201d said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who recently visited the front lines. \u201cArguably, the problem was in the assumption that with a few months of training, Ukrainian units could be converted into fighting more the way American forces might fight, leading the assault against a well-prepared Russian defense, rather than helping Ukrainians fight more the best way they know how.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[...]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Biden administration officials had hoped the nine Western-trained brigades, some 36,000 troops, would show that the American way of warfare was superior to the Russian approach.

But nobody has actually really bothered holding them accountable for legitimate professional related problems in a very long time.\n\nCase in point. The battle of Wanat happened in Afghanistan in 2008. The Army sent a unit at the very tale end of very violent 15 month combat deployment to create a new combat outpost. The brigade had been trying to build it for half a year, bought the land (sitting in low ground dominated by unsecure high ground). Despite most of the brigade finishing combat ops and starting the process to redeploy back to Italy where they were based, the brigade commander insisted they stand up the new COP, not the new unit relieving them. The division's operations officer overseeing it approved that plan, with his only comment being \"Are you sure you aren't overextending yourself?\" After being told no, the mission was approved by said general officer. \n\nLong story short, despite the mission being listed as the brigade main effort, nobody paid attention to it. Extra drone coverage was denied. Only a single platoon of US troops was tasked to stand up the COP, and they had limited support so supplies were low to the point they couldn't do too much manual labor because lack of water. The brigade, battalion, and company commander all ignored it. \n\nBut the Taliban didn't, they'd known since the start of negotiations that involved finding the land, had organized a massive attack that only needed a few days notice to organize once it started. Once the US troops started, the Taliban made calls, started massing forces all over the area, spending a week getting a reinforced company equivalent with lots of heavy weapons. Why weren't they spotted? The overextended platoon was too small to patrol the area, and drone footage wasn't approved despite the mission being officially the brigade main effort.\n\nThe attack overran the squad sized observation post and only didn't overrun the rest because US troops put up a hell of a fight, but more importantly Apaches showed up and then more air support.\n\nCENTCOM did an investigation and found that the whole operation was HUGELY flawed. They recommended criminal charges for negligence against the company, battalion and brigade commanders for violating a whole bunch of regulations for ignoring the operation despite it being their main effort.

Then the outgoing four star general running Force Command (all non deployed US Army units) rescinded all the letters on his last day before retiring, citing a desire not to set a bad example that commanders will become risk averse for their decision making. \n\nThe company and battalion commander are both now generals.

They don&#39;t have enough AFV to keep trying against that. But they&#39;re not suffering for lack of infantry either. Based on reporting, their infantry attacks are more survivable but still extremely dangerous. </p>\n\n<p>So the defender&#39;s dilemma seems to be the ISR tools that can find the tanks and hit them at long range can&#39;t find the dismounts and hit them at long range. But if the real threat was drones plus arty, even at the small unit those dismounted attacks would suffer incredibly high losses. They&#39;re not, it sounds like they&#39;re suffering losses but not having units destroyed. That means there are MAJOR gaps in drone coverage, and the arty isn&#39;t firing at them even by ground observation, for whatever reason.</p>\n</div>",

A gift from the police of the city of Miami, which was the first to decide on such a step. A wonderful donor donated 148,000 cartridges to her,\u201d adding that \u201cOleksandr Markushyn (Mayor of Irpin)- your brand new rifles are already rushing to you!\u201d\n\n>According to War Noir on Twitter, the firearms include \u201d a rare Cobray CM-11/Nine 9mm carbine, AR-15 rifles (including Smith & Wesson M&P 15), AK-platform rifles and pistols (Glock, HS, Beretta 92FS and more) can be seen.\u201d It is important to note that the rifles are only semi-automatic.\n\n>According to the Ukraine Military Center, Zablotsky said \u201cActually, the idea arose to ask US citizens for their surplus weapons, because many simply have dozens of them. Many of them are ready to share surplus weapons \u2013 transfer them here. There are also a lot of confiscated weapons.\u201d\n\n>Last June, the the Miami Police Department launched its \u201cGuns 4 Ukraine buyback program,\u201d which offered city residents $50 for handguns, $100 for shotguns and $150 for rifles. In total, 167 firearms were collected, with the aim of sending them to Irpin, the sister city of Miami. Some of the firearms seen in pictures from the buyback program appear to be the same ones in the recent shipment, suggesting those donated weapons were involved in this first batch of weapons, which Zablotsky said also included confiscated firearms from criminal investigations.\n\n>Similarly, the city of Phoenix has approved plans to donate 600 unclaimed firearms in the city\u2019s possession to the National Police of Ukraine in Kyiv. The donation is being headed up by the Pennsylvania-based logistics company DTGruelle, who told AZ Mirror that \u201cWe had gotten the city of Miami to donate us firearms through their processes and then the city of Phoenix wanted to piggyback off of that and do their own initiative with us through our contact over at [the] Ukrainian parliament.\u201d\n\n>DTGruelle noted that the transfer process is lengthy, stating that \u201cThis has taken such a long time because of the due diligence that the city needs to take, that we need to take, in reviewing the various regulations together to ensure that we\u2019re doing this very responsibly.\u201d",

And your general view of Western media. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are balancing considerations for these points detailed in the report, but I&#39;ve quoted these specific portions to highlight that RAND takes this issue seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the top level, the biggest &quot;balancing consideration&quot; is the focal point that I was trying to make:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, many of these indicators could change dramatically in a crisis or conflict, so it is impossible to predict with any certainty how Taiwan\u2019s political leadership and social cohesion might play out in a future war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>RAND has highlighted in the past the numerous times that they themselves underestimated the will of the natives to fight for their land, most notably in Vietnam when they repeatedly thought air raids were softening the Viet Cong&#39;s morale and will to fight due to the steep losses they were suffering. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The issue I&#39;m talking about pertains to the psychological warfare campaign the PRC has been conducting against Taiwan for the past few decades, one whose intensity has increased exponentially in recent years. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t think being overwhelmed by a much larger enemy, without any allies, and being spanked repeatedly by the best modern military in virtually every engagement, while being hunted and killed by helicopters that you can&#39;t even hear, let alone see, wasn&#39;t 20 plus years of intense psychological warfare on the Taliban, then there&#39;s no way I can convince you. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What exactly does the phrase &quot;various commanders and officials&quot; mean to you? Military and political leadership in multiple towns and cities, Kherson included, in Eastern Ukraine stood down or abandoned their duties. What else would this be other than &quot;various commanders and officials&quot;?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dereliction of duty and telling their troops to lay down their arms and give up are two vastly different things. OP was insinuating widespread surrender. Various commanders and officials in this war did not stop the fight, and Ukraine has in fact benefitted highly from a resistance and saboteur cadre that has helped their fight every step of the way. And for every minor example of cowardice, we have contra examples of bravery in the face of certain doom. Henichesk bridge, Snake Island, Zelensky himself. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does this have to do with my point? I&#39;m talking about a risk, not making a prognosis for the entire conflict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point is, that&#39;s how counterintelligence works. You have moles, the other party will have moles to find your moles. It&#39;s part and parcel of warfare. Further, whatever weaknesses you&#39;re ascribing to Taiwan&#39;s will to fight, or through graft, don&#39;t exist in a vacuum.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-defence-corruption/china-military-says-army-yet-to-fully-embrace-rule-of-law-idUSKBN0NQ05P20150505\">China military says army yet to fully embrace rule of law</a></p>\n\n<p>Serving and retired Chinese military officers have said military graft is so pervasive it could undermine China\u2019s ability to wage war, and dozens of senior officers have been taken down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

France is one of the biggest winners of this war. Alas, the political opposition in France is so clueless that Macron has to moderate his rhetoric.</p>\n</div>",

As far as I&#39;m concerned, neither is a good entity to rely upon.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m also not sure about the long term, increased militarization of Europe is necessary because of the circumstances, but it has historically been a driver of much conflict. Poland will have one of the strongest land armies in the coming decade, Germany is increasingly expanding its budget to deal with the new norm.</p>\n</div>",

In their eyes, moving American weaponry into Taiwan is tantamount to an invasion of China.\n> \n> \n\nSee that logic works if the US suddenly decided to move materiel to Taiwan. Of course in reality the US has been arming Taiwan since WWII, and China has more than tolerated it. 'Yeah but now we're mad' should make you think, 'but why are they now mad?'.\n\n>If your response is that China doesn't own Taiwan, then you've just repudiated 50 years of American diplomacy, in which the US has publicly pledged not to question China's claim to Taiwan.\n\nLol no. Taiwan also believes that they belong to China. Because China is a region. You might as well start saying that the US supports South Korea assimilating into North Korea because they think it belongs to Korea. This is covered in the documents below and a ton of other official statements.\n\n> This is just chronologically the wrong way around. China ramped up its military activity around Taiwan as a direct response to American moves towards recognizing Taiwanese independence, most notably (but not only) through Pelosi's official visit. Even American commentators (and Biden himself) widely acknowledged that Pelosi's visit was an entirely unnecessary provocation, and that it was bound to elicit a major Chinese response. If anything, American commentators at the time were surprised that China's military response wasn't larger than it turned out to be.\n\nYou're talking about something from 2022. Yeah that's the reason for the military exercises. It's not the reason why China made legislation to strengthen their amphibious capability in 2016, why they've been strengthening both their missile and naval capabilities over the last two decades or why they've increasingly been threatening forced assimilation rather than pursuing a peaceful one.\n\n>The Chinese believe that in the long run, time is on their side. It's the Americans who believe that they have to force the issue of Taiwan sooner rather than later, because the balance of military and economic power is shifting in China's favor.\n\nUmm. I'm more bullish on Chinese dominance than most. I fully believe that there's going to be a clash when that comes closer, since the US at the very least isn't going to allow something like that. But even I don't have that rosy view. China is at the best place it's going to be right this very moment.\n\n* China has completed multiple military programs to strengthen their overall capability which the US doesn't have a clear answer for.\n\n* China has strategic allies\n\n* China has a battleground in its backyard to force US over-extension.\n\n* The US has built and trained its army for fighting insurgents in a desert. \n\n* Is bankrolling a separate war against a Chinese ally in a whole other theater\n\n* Has just realized that they lack the stockpiles for significant fighting, but haven't ramped up the capacity yet. \n\n\nThat's about as good as it gets. And the near future gets worse. The US is going to start pumping out materiel soon enough and then China is going against a US that is already ramping up for war. On top of that, the US has put multiple programs into the works to shore up its weaknesses *specifically against China*. They're testing a new carrier fighter with a long enough range to strike outside of Chinese missile range (which the carriers currently cannot do, which would be devastating), they're testing a high piercing rifle meant to defeat modern combat armor (again for China's modern armored troops), they're testing light tanks for the marines for amphibious landings (again specifically for fast mobilizations in the China sea). It's not a good situation. And all the while, China is dealing with their population decreasing while they've geared their economy for explosive growth and both Pakistand and Russia are having issues. That makes for a rocky future. If they don't use this chance, they wont have another anywhere as good for the next two decades, and by then they're going to be the singular threat to the US which has been tailoring their army to fight China.\n\n>I assume you say \"best laid out\" because you prefer the Six Assurances to the three joint US-China communiqu\u00e9s. In those communiqu\u00e9s, the US promises to slowly wind down American military assistance to Taiwan, and it promises never to question Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan or to suggest that Taiwan is / should be independent. Behind the scenes, \n\nI don't 'prefer' them. They were specifically made in relation to them. The US does not acknowledge the PRC sovereignty over Taiwan. They have indeed specifically said that they will not do so. What they have said is that there is only one China and Taiwan belongs to it. Which is what both the PRC and the POC say as well. It is a fact that the US has said it *acknowledges* and has multiple times clarified that it does not go any further than that and will not. This is also covered in [the communiques](https://www.choices.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/choices-china-US-china.pdf):\n\n>The U.S. side declared: The United States\nacknowledges that all Chinese on either side\nof the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one\nChina and that Taiwan is a part of China. The\nUnited States Government does not challenge\nthat position. It reaffirms its interest in peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the\nChinese themselves. With this prospect in\nmind, it affirms the ultimate objective of the\nwithdrawal of all U.S. forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area\ndiminishes.\n\nThere's nobody that thinks the assurances and the communiques are incompatible, and indeed the six assurances were made into US policy by the senate not that long ago. They are made to clarify the US's position. The communiques say on the topic of arming Taiwan:\n\n> Having in mind the foregoing statements\nof both sides, the United States Government\nstates that it does not seek to carry out a longterm policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its\narms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either\nin qualitative or in quantitative terms, the\nlevel of those supplied in recent years since\nthe establishment of diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and China, and that\nit intends to reduce gradually its sales of arms\nto Taiwan, leading over a period of time to a\nfinal resolution. In so stating, the United States\nacknowledges China\u2019s consistent position\nregarding the thorough settlement of this issue.\n\n\nAnd that was considered as sounding too much like the US was saying it would decrease their sales without any context. But the statement does give context in the first line with \"Having in mind the foregoing statements.\" Those foregoing statements being the Chinese assurances that they were seeking a peaceful settlement:\n\n>\u201d The\nUnited States Government understands and\nappreciates the Chinese policy of striving for a\npeaceful resolution of the Taiwan question as\nindicated in China\u2019s Message to Compatriots\nin Taiwan issued on January 1, 1979, and the\nNine-Point Proposal put forward by China on\nSeptember 30, 1981. The new situation which\nhas emerged with regard to the Taiwan question also provides favorable conditions for the\nsettlement of the United States-China differences over the question of United States arms\nsale to Taiwan.\n\nIt is in fact entirely hinged on the Chinese seeking a peaceful solution to the issue and by \"qualitiative or in quantitative terms, the level supplied in recent years\", they meant to the level of making Taiwan unappetizing for military conquest. That's also why they've hinged their military assistance with: \"as the tension in the area\ndiminishes.\"\n\n\nThe US said it wants a reunification, Taiwan asked if that meant they weren't going to support them, to which the US clarified what it meant. China has since then made threats and moves towards a forced unification and the US has made countermoves to stop that. That is very much in the spirit of the agreement. If you want to say the US reneged on their deal by further arming Taiwan, China reneged on their deal by further facilitating an invasion. Perfectly fine to see it like that, but most tend to see it the opposite way of both having a bumpy time of seeking what they laid out in their official communications.\n\n\nAlso:\n\n>Behind the scenes, during the negotiations over those joint communiqu\u00e9s, the US went much farther, and outright told the Chinese that the US recognizes Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nDocuments from that period have become declassified. I've shared the very document were Reagan specifically said they wouldn't tolerate Chinese escalation and that they do not accept PRC sovereignty over Taiwan. You should be able to share that document where they told China they recognized Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The Chinese view Taiwan as part of China. In their eyes, moving American weaponry into Taiwan is tantamount to an invasion of China.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See that logic works if the US suddenly decided to move materiel to Taiwan. Of course in reality the US has been arming Taiwan since WWII, and China has more than tolerated it. &#39;Yeah but now we&#39;re mad&#39; should make you think, &#39;but why are they now mad?&#39;.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your response is that China doesn&#39;t own Taiwan, then you&#39;ve just repudiated 50 years of American diplomacy, in which the US has publicly pledged not to question China&#39;s claim to Taiwan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lol no. Taiwan also believes that they belong to China. Because China is a region. You might as well start saying that the US supports South Korea assimilating into North Korea because they think it belongs to Korea. This is covered in the documents below and a ton of other official statements.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is just chronologically the wrong way around. China ramped up its military activity around Taiwan as a direct response to American moves towards recognizing Taiwanese independence, most notably (but not only) through Pelosi&#39;s official visit. Even American commentators (and Biden himself) widely acknowledged that Pelosi&#39;s visit was an entirely unnecessary provocation, and that it was bound to elicit a major Chinese response. If anything, American commentators at the time were surprised that China&#39;s military response wasn&#39;t larger than it turned out to be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re talking about something from 2022. Yeah that&#39;s the reason for the military exercises. It&#39;s not the reason why China made legislation to strengthen their amphibious capability in 2016, why they&#39;ve been strengthening both their missile and naval capabilities over the last two decades or why they&#39;ve increasingly been threatening forced assimilation rather than pursuing a peaceful one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Chinese believe that in the long run, time is on their side. It&#39;s the Americans who believe that they have to force the issue of Taiwan sooner rather than later, because the balance of military and economic power is shifting in China&#39;s favor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Umm. I&#39;m more bullish on Chinese dominance than most. I fully believe that there&#39;s going to be a clash when that comes closer, since the US at the very least isn&#39;t going to allow something like that. But even I don&#39;t have that rosy view. China is at the best place it&#39;s going to be right this very moment.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>China has completed multiple military programs to strengthen their overall capability which the US doesn&#39;t have a clear answer for.</p></li>\n<li><p>China has strategic allies</p></li>\n<li><p>China has a battleground in its backyard to force US over-extension.</p></li>\n<li><p>The US has built and trained its army for fighting insurgents in a desert. </p></li>\n<li><p>Is bankrolling a separate war against a Chinese ally in a whole other theater</p></li>\n<li><p>Has just realized that they lack the stockpiles for significant fighting, but haven&#39;t ramped up the capacity yet. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&#39;s about as good as it gets. And the near future gets worse. The US is going to start pumping out materiel soon enough and then China is going against a US that is already ramping up for war. On top of that, the US has put multiple programs into the works to shore up its weaknesses <em>specifically against China</em>. They&#39;re testing a new carrier fighter with a long enough range to strike outside of Chinese missile range (which the carriers currently cannot do, which would be devastating), they&#39;re testing a high piercing rifle meant to defeat modern combat armor (again for China&#39;s modern armored troops), they&#39;re testing light tanks for the marines for amphibious landings (again specifically for fast mobilizations in the China sea). It&#39;s not a good situation. And all the while, China is dealing with their population decreasing while they&#39;ve geared their economy for explosive growth and both Pakistand and Russia are having issues. That makes for a rocky future. If they don&#39;t use this chance, they wont have another anywhere as good for the next two decades, and by then they&#39;re going to be the singular threat to the US which has been tailoring their army to fight China.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I assume you say &quot;best laid out&quot; because you prefer the Six Assurances to the three joint US-China communiqu\u00e9s. In those communiqu\u00e9s, the US promises to slowly wind down American military assistance to Taiwan, and it promises never to question Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan or to suggest that Taiwan is / should be independent. Behind the scenes, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t &#39;prefer&#39; them. They were specifically made in relation to them. The US does not acknowledge the PRC sovereignty over Taiwan. They have indeed specifically said that they will not do so. What they have said is that there is only one China and Taiwan belongs to it. Which is what both the PRC and the POC say as well. It is a fact that the US has said it <em>acknowledges</em> and has multiple times clarified that it does not go any further than that and will not. This is also covered in <a href=\"https://www.choices.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/choices-china-US-china.pdf\">the communiques</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. side declared: The United States\nacknowledges that all Chinese on either side\nof the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one\nChina and that Taiwan is a part of China.

It's from early June last year and is presented as a \"descriptive\" view on general Russian thinking/strategy in Ukraine rather than a \"prescriptive\" one so it wouldn't fall under \"open (or to be fair any) call for genocide\" but back in early June after the fall of Mariupol there was a lot of \"soul searching\" in a lot of the more extreme circles of Russian society. With the first phase of war ending in withdrawal from the general Kyiv area and Russians finally \"liberating\" Mariupol whilst taking massive casualties, there was a brief period in which they had very few things to focus on the battlefield (the northern Luhansk campaign wasn't the crown jewel they were much interested in) and it was becoming increasingly apparent Russia would struggle to achieve even the bare minimum of their goals they had at the outset (ie. taking over the whole of Donbas and securing the land bridge to Crimea) a lot of those circles at this exact period really started focusing on how to best measure and achieve success in the war - and what he wrote there is essentially a list of \"solutions\" and \"reinterpretations\" of Putin's three vague goals they were floating in those extreme circles back then, presented as his own descriptive opinion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were able to see certain individual ideas filtering up into more mainstream Russian media already couple of weeks before the initial gesture of good will, but there they tended to be occasional flashes rather than a formulation of coherent policy, and that's by design. Looking back on it, you'll see how unrealistic his fundamental premises were and they were rather well picked apart even back then, but just wanted to make a note of the use of both coded language and dehumanizing language as well as hiding behind descriptive wording shouldn't really be a benchmark when approaching people like this. I understand it's essentially in the fundamental nature of this subreddit to see posts like this pop up in order to foment a discussion and have an exchange of opinions about what's actually taking place, but I can assure you that this particular individual does share a lot of those views you find detestable on Telegram.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd also like to add that for some reason he decided not to include a very particular idea that I first saw coming to fore and first being extensively formulated back then in May/June 2022 (presumably because it became obvious even within those circles that the war won't end before the following Christmas, as it didn't in '14, '41 nor '44) - and that's a deliberate, planned out missile campaign targeting the energy infrastructure with the express purpose of freezing, starving and eventually forcing out Ukrainians, or as he put it bluntly \"the incorrigibly anti-Russian population\" (n.b. that with this formulation, curiously absent of any quotation mark that he otherwise extensively uses in that post, he completely strips their Ukrainian identity and essentially distils it into just one fundamental thing - being anti-Russian).  I suspect since that since this was an idea floating in the more political circles rather than the military(-adjacent) circles he possibly found it too non-credible or simply overlooked it, but it did become the official policy of the Russian State mere months afterwards. That's just one example of potential real life implications that these type of people bring about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for his addition to this sub, I've enjoyed and learned a lot from reading more knowledgeable people than myself pick apart a lot of his claims over the past 18 or so months, but I haven't engaged him in any way, shape or form so I didn't find it frustrating - yet in order to debunk a single \"source\" and claims that he simply pulls out of his ass it takes a lot of time and energy on part of many users, and sometimes there isn't enough of it going around to properly debunk it and he certainly wears them down over time, so with time a lot more of them will probably filter through unchecked.

I was reading a pro Ukranian source on Quora, which claimed that three things make western equipment like Leopards superior in comparison to Russian equipment:- their ability to see first, their quietness and the fact that they're more difficult to detect, and their better crew protection in case you are spotted anyways and shot at. I wanted to ask:- how much of the first two advantages remain when launching an offensive or a counteroffensive? Even if your enemy is noisier and has difficulties in seeing you first, wouldn't both of these things become substantially easy for them when they are defending? So how does one deal with this negation of advantages?",

It was incredibly disorienting and frustrating - every corner you turn and the noise changes and comes from a different direction.

Yet however liberal they are with GMLRS these days I seriously doubt they'd use them without an eye on the target for the duration of fire mission. They have a serious need to know what a relocatable target is doing and will remain where they are the second they pull the trigger, and they have the need to know if they hit a decoy, missed by 70m or hit what they think they were going to or even hit something more by chance like a pile of ammo in the wood. There are probably few GMLRS hits that weren't caught on camera other than deepstrikes against fixed targets generated by external intelligence sources. Since no more big ammo explosions caught by bystanders it's very hard to know to what degree they are having success in those use cases and against what.\n\nNeither do I believe there's a huge pile of Russian Lancet kill footage the Russians are hiding.

Yet however liberal they are with GMLRS these days I seriously doubt they&#39;d use them without an eye on the target for the duration of fire mission. They have a serious need to know what a relocatable target is doing and will remain where they are the second they pull the trigger, and they have the need to know if they hit a decoy, missed by 70m or hit what they think they were going to or even hit something more by chance like a pile of ammo in the wood. There are probably few GMLRS hits that weren&#39;t caught on camera other than deepstrikes against fixed targets generated by external intelligence sources. Since no more big ammo explosions caught by bystanders it&#39;s very hard to know to what degree they are having success in those use cases and against what.</p>\n\n<p>Neither do I believe there&#39;s a huge pile of Russian Lancet kill footage the Russians are hiding.

While you can list numbers in terms of \"billions of USD\" sent to Ukraine, a lot of that time, that money is already spent decades prior, and its not as big of a burden as it seems. The real pressure would come from the populace of said countries to stop said aid. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut even then, I sincerely doubt many Western countries would wholesale stop aid. The Russia-Ukraine war is probably the biggest geopolticial opportunity countries like America have had in the past 30 years. Its only outclassed by the fall of the USSR. It severely weakens the economic, military, and diplomatic standing of Russia, and it doesn't cost any American lives, just aid, which they can give in bulks. Plus it gives them the opportunity to test their equipment against a peer opponent in a proxy war. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHell, even if all military, humanitarian, and financial aid stops. Countries will still without a doubt provide intelligence. The All-Seeing-Eye of American intelligence has proved undoubtably one of Ukraine's biggest assets.

One of the biggest obstacles Russia would have is pushing across the Dnieper river. Even if aid dries up, Russia has a staggering lack of capabilities to cross the Dnieper. They only did so in Kherson at the beginning of the war by surprise, but Ukraine is ready now, and the Dnieper is as wide as a small lake in many parts. Its a serious amphibious operation, and their capitol is on the right bank of it. And the terrain in Northern Ukraine is also pretty marshy and not suitable for attack as history has shown, and not to mention Kyiv is about as fortified as Berlin/Moscow were during WW2. If Bakhmut is anything to go by, Kyiv would take ages to crack. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut in the case that the Ukrainian government does fall and an insurgency does proceed, I doubt it continues for a long period. Without trying to play into some stereotypes, the most effective insurgents in history have been Islamic, primarily because of that religious-cultural drive. While morale in the Ukrainian army is high, I don't know that morale for an insurgency will be as extensive. The current Russian government has experience in crushing Chechen insurrectionism, which while of lower size than Ukraine, I would arguably say was more fervent in its resistance. And it did so fairly quickly all things considered. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>And when Ukraine starts to get into real trouble because of a lack of weapons and ammunition, we might see terror attacks on Russian civilians out of desperation.\n\nOn factories, refineries, railways? Sure, I don't think with a similar mindset to say, the bombing of Japanese cities in WW2 though. Ukraine doesn't have the means to really engage in any large scale strategic bombing on Russian territory.
