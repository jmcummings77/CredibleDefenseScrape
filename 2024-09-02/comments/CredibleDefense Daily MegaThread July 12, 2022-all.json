This civilian loss of life is basically inevitable it is a part of war. Crucially though Russia normally has a military target in mind further they are normally able to destroy this target through quantity of shells alone.\n\nWhat concerns me is Russia will bring in their soviet heavy artillery which can fire 40km's but is very imprecise at this range and basically start leveling entire grid points.

Certainly, make Russia pay for every inch, drag it out as long as possible, but don't rush forces in to try and hold it at all costs like happened in SD.  I feel this way for three reasons. First, the S-B line is placed awkwardly. Not quite the salient SD was, but there's still the opportunity to attack both towns from several directions, allowing for maximum artillery concentration. The Slovyansk/Kramatorsk (SK) line has a flat front. While there is a right angle corner in the north, the river helps shield this front and attacks out of Izium just don't have the punch of the railhead supplied sectors; to the south, the flank is refused at an angle down to Donetsk, another fortified hard point.  There will be no concentration of fire on the SK line. Second, every km added to the Russian logistics is a KM away from the Russian way of war. SD presented the Russians at their best: Unlimited ammo, near unlimited guns, supplies direct from a rail head. That's all the advantages Russia has, but they are big advantages. SB is far enough from the railhead to give the supply trucks a workout, but SK may be 'a bridge too far' for Russian logistics. Finally, the quality of fortifications on the SK line are already superior, and with an extra 2 weeks/month of construction, can be extremely superior with some concrete construction, overhead bunker protections, accurate artillery fire maps and if time permits, some old school barbed wire and mines and cleared fields of fire to the front. Just my thoughts.\n\n2) is there any kind of count for how many trucks are being KO'd in these ammo shots? There's anecdotal evidence that several were hit while the Russians were trying to pack them up and disburse them, and last night's Nova Krakova strike is rumored to have destroyed 30+ fuel tankers, but I haven't seen anything from a higher elevation. I'm all about vehicle degradation- I feel the best path to victory (or at least a shift in momentum) is to knock out anything on tires or treads- Russia's big, they can always raise more bodies, but they can't draft tanks, apcs or army grade supply trucks.  \n\n3) I'm concerned that I haven't seen enough commitments for 155mm guns going forward. Ukraine has more or less 300 155mms in the line, which is substantial, but they need at least 100 more and could really use 300 more. The first 105mms should be in country any day now (crews have been training in UK for weeks)- The 105mms are scrappy useful guns, but they aren't 'God of War' level like a 155mm.  It's possible that the US is just continuing to ship in more M777s without a press release, as a pool needs to be available for repair swap out/barreling in addition to deployable guns- this smacks of wishful thinking. Does anyone have a better handle on the artillery plan from 30,000 feet?\n\n\n4) I went down to the mall yesterday, and at the personalized T-shirt kiosk, I had them make me a mug that says \"It's HIMARS O'clock Somewhere\".  Tacky and juvenile, I know, but that's who I am.",

The vulnerability of infrastructure, in particular, to these sorts of \u2018low-end\u2019 drone attacks is a topic we have explored in the past. Such attacks have also been prosecuted by a combination of suicide drones as well as ballistic and/or cruise missiles, making defense against them even more problematic.  \n\n>Even used on their own, these kinds of drones are by no means straightforward to counter using traditional air defenses and, in all, they can have a destructive effect that\u2019s entirely at odds with their relatively low cost of procurement.  \n  \n>As a means of prosecuting long-range attacks, Iranian armed drones would be much cheaper than using cruise or ballistic missiles. Furthermore, Russia\u2019s capacity to produce such weapons in the face of sanctions is also questionable. While the Iranian-made suicide drones would lack the sophistication and reduced radar cross-section of the latest Russian cruise missiles, they would be highly suitable for the same kinds of pinpoint attacks on infrastructure. Their range would also mean they could be used against targets in western Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. Even using them indiscriminately as a sort of 'vengeance weapon' on the capital is a real possibility.  \n\n>There is also the possibility that Russian could exploit Iranian expertise to prosecute different kinds of drone strikes, including against maritime targets if the need arises, for example, if the conflict expands into the strategically vital Black Sea. Tehran has much experience in this area, having attacked, or coordinated attacks, on commercial shipping on a number of occasions in the past. In August last year, for example, U.S. Central Command released details of a fatal drone attack on a Liberian-flagged, Israeli-operated tanker, M/T Mercer Street, off the coast of Oman. Iran was blamed for that incident, which involved three strikes carried out by \u201cone-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles,\u201d better known as suicide drones.  \n\n>Other Iranian drones have been developed specifically to seek and destroy air defenses, in the same kind of role that was first pioneered by the Israeli-developed Harpy drone. This could be of particular relevance to Russia as it seeks to further degrade the Ukrainian air defense network, especially as new kinds of surface-to-air missiles begin to threaten Russian aircraft. Degrading Ukraine's air defenses via anti-radiation seeker-equipped drones could help open up the airspace in the western part of the country for attacks by traditional manned assets.  \n \n>With all this in mind, it is clear that acquiring Iranian armed UAVs, especially suicide drone types, in such large numbers, could be very attractive for Russia. Indeed, according to Iranian reports, Russian interest in buying its drones \u2014 or perhaps licence-producing them \u2014 dates back to 2019, at least a year before the UN arms embargo on Iran was lifted.  \n\n>Then there is the issue of what Tehran stands to gain from a possible deal of this kind. Securing a hugely valuable new customer \u2014 one that is fighting an active all-out war no less \u2014 for its arms comes at a time when sanctions have taken their toll and cash infusions are much needed. It would also send a powerful signal of its support to the Moscow regime, which has found itself more or less an international pariah since invading Ukraine in February this year. Tehran has already said it blames NATO expansion in Eastern Europe for triggering the war in Ukraine.  \n\n>As to getting Iranian drones to Russia, that would likely make use of an already established pattern of cargo flights between the two countries. According to data gathered by aircraft tracker and satellite image analyst Gerjon, in the first three months following the invasion of Ukraine, at least 23 Iranian cargo flights flew from Iran to Moscow. Exactly what these aircraft were transporting remains unclear, but all seem to have landed in Moscow and were flown by airlines that have been understood to have transported arms to other countries in the past. In particular, some of the same aircraft and airlines were noted flying to Ethiopia immediately before Iranian-made Mohajer-6 drones appeared in that country.  \n\n>There is also the option of delivering weapons by sea. According to a report yesterday from the semi-official Mehr News, Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) is shipping 300 \u201cspecial containers\u201d containing undisclosed goods to Russia. The same statement noted that, if demand increases, the number of containers can also grow.  \n\n>However they are supplied, getting drones into Russian hands quickly could be of great value. The Iranian drone portfolio, by and large, is heavily focused on systems that smaller militaries or even non-state actors can be trained to use quickly. On the whole, they also require minimal logistics, which would be another boon for Russia and its much-publicized logistics issues.  \n \n>If Russian does indeed get its hands on large quantities of Iranian drones, it could mark a significant shift in the war in Ukraine, with Tehran\u2019s entry into the arena as a potentially significant political player. At the same time, should Russia start deploying Iranian-made suicide drones, as seems entirely possible, it will further reinforce the fact that we are very much entering a new age of warfare, in which standoff strikes by one-way drones are an increasingly common \u2014 and challenging \u2014 dynamic.",

I don't bring up a 1000 years of colonialism when discussing India/Pakistan. I don't bring up the Portuguese every time I want to discuss Brazil's current horrible treatment of its native population. And in all of those examples, you could argue that the party that's not being discussed is/was probably more at fault for the current misery. That you could trace back the origins of present sins to that broader historical context. But, that's the thing. Context matters. When you reduce everything down to whataboutism, you lose all tethers to reality, and you're left with no reference point anymore. You're left feeling a sense of hopelessness in humanities failures. Instead, by focusing on the current issue at hand, we can have more rational and honest conversations about what can be done today to fix the wrongs that we see today. \n\nAnd believe me, I'd happily engage in the very same conversation if it was any power in the West pursuing these sorts of wars of misadventure.",

                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Chomsky only compared Putin&#39;s invasion to the Hitler-Stalin invasion, would you have a problem?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with any comparison anyone makes in isolation that&#39;s relatively appropriate and specific to a topic. You&#39;re misrepresenting Chomsky if you don&#39;t think he brings almost <em>everything</em> back to the US. If he did that with Hitler, then <strong>yes</strong>. I absolutely would have a problem with that. It&#39;s why most people dismiss politicians who equate every ideological stance that they personally disagree with as a slide towards Hitler&#39;s Nazi Germany and fascism. The old idiom that if you evoke Naziism right at the onset of a debate means you&#39;ve lost the debate, still stands. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So as I correctly guessed, you would absolutely <strong>not</strong> have a problem if Chomsky only compared Putin&#39;s invasion to the Hitler-Stalin invasion (even though ironically, your last sentence above can easily be interpreted to mean that you take issue with Chomsky&#39;s Poland 1939 comparison too...)</p>\n\n<p>No, your problem emerges because Chomsky <em>also</em> brought up Iraq 2003. Well, if you&#39;re not comfortable confronting our own crimes, you should think about why you&#39;re not comfortable with that.</p>\n\n<p>And on that note,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An example he&#39;s given before is that we in the West love to hear Iranian dissidents criticize the crimes of the Iranian theocracy. Wow, what bravery, such courage! standing ovation But if those same Iranian dissidents criticize the US, Israel, etc., meh, they need to STFU.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your premise is such hokey bullshit that it&#39;s hard to take this seriously. Not only is my own comment history littered with criticism of US missteps, untethering of the principals the country is founded upon and policy mistakes, most that live in free democracies, including most on this very subreddit, are constantly criticizing their own countries and leaders. For all the criticism of the media in the West, they still operate largely independently. Liberal elements in the US are openly hostile to the foreign policy of their own country. I honestly can&#39;t remember the last time I saw a Netflix/Amazon/HBO show (that involves any level of geopolitics) that didn&#39;t talk either about the Philippines, the Mujahadeen, Grenada, Iran Contra or the Sandinistas. Fuck, one of the most popular shows in the US right now, The Boys, is a thinly disguised mockery of US politics. What the fuck are you talking about?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your attitude is...interesting. You reject my Iranian dissident example because you claim that your own comment history is &quot;littered with criticism of US missteps.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s explore this. Why is that</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>you can have a comment history &quot;littered&quot; with criticism of the US while being proudly pro-American,</p></li>\n<li><p>but if Chomsky has a written history &quot;littered&quot; with criticism of the US, man, that goshdarned Chomsky fella, why does he always gotta bring <em>everything</em> back to the US???</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Seems like quite an unfair double standard, but maybe you can help me understand why you think it&#39;s neither unfair nor a double standard.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chomsky never said Putin&#39;s invasion of Iraq was equally bad as the U.S. invasion of Iraq. So right off the bat, there&#39;s a straw man. Paraphrasing Chomsky, there is no such thing as moral equivalence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean, I know you&#39;re not going to recognize or acknowledge the contradiction in those two statements but let me put it like this: Chomsky has repeatedly twisted himself into a pretzel by claiming that moral equivalence is a term of &quot;propaganda&quot;, that one crime is a rational result of another crime regardless of the scale, and that the US has no right to be the &quot;moral police&quot; of the world given its own sins. Yet, he&#39;s also the guy that believes in &quot;justice&quot; for the Palestinians, legality and moral &quot;improvement&quot;. Again, as I said, I&#39;m not an out and out critic of Chomsky, but to claim that he doesn&#39;t have an enormous blind spot and an addiction/compulsion to bringing the US&#39;s history into every single world event, is just nonsensical. Everything is a nail to a hammer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you think I contradicted myself, feel free to point out and explain the contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>Also, nothing that you wrote even came close to rebutting Chomsky&#39;s argument against &quot;moral equivalence&quot; (that you are clearly familiar with). You used the term in exactly the way that he criticized: as a way to avoid confronting our own crimes that you&#39;d just rather not talk about.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A comparison never has to be equal. A Su-25 &quot;can be compared to&quot; an A-10. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re &quot;equal.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Except, you&#39;re taking one singular comment of Chomsky&#39;s and using it as a representation of his broader commentary and worldview. Not only that, but you also definitely can&#39;t compare a Su-25 to a Globemaster III even though they are both military planes, yeah? See how we can both play at that bullshit game?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I honestly have no idea what you&#39;re even arguing here. Do you believe that two things <em>do</em> have to be &quot;equal&quot; in order for them to be compared?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the reality of why most take an umbrage to bringing the U.S. into this specific conflict, and more so, this specific thread, is that you can&#39;t have a serious conversation around Russia&#39;s actions without it being mucked up by a hundred years of revisionist history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ooh, &quot;revisionist history.&quot; Especially given your tone thus far, I would normally snark at what that term is code for, but you said &quot;on a more serious note,&quot; so I&#39;ll oblige.</p>\n\n<p>Chomsky did not &quot;bring the U.S. into this specific conflict.&quot; The proof is that he also compared Putin&#39;s invasion to Poland 1939, <em>and you haven&#39;t complained that he brought Hitler/Nazi Germany or Stalin/USSR into this specific conflict</em>.

The same can be said for the US, China, India and so on. Without even touching upon any sort of morality as all sides will ultimately claim moral highground, this is what it boils down to and it's actually the most neutral way I can present my argument since none of this is unique to Russia and they're all ever present universal concepts when we're talking about great power politics.\n\nI think one can also very much oppose Putin's actions without ignoring the fact that NATO also holds significant responsibility for the current situation which no one really wants to own up to as it is much more convenient to just paint Putin and Russia in the colours of the Third Reich and let people rage against a conjured image of irrational evil that hates freedom.\n\nI don't want to get into the idea that the US already essentially promised away Eastern Europe to Russia when they agreed that the newly unified Germany would be a NATO member, as that is a very controversial detail of that agreement, so let's talk about NATO enlargement in general.\n\nFirst off, NATO's primary purpose was to act as a defensive alliance, a hedge against the Soviet Union and it's threats, and now it is also an alliance against Russia, the primary and universally recognized successor of the USSR, the Russians are right to view anyone joining this alliance as being aligned against them. Now also consider that this alliance, has demonstrated time and time again that it isn't a defensive alliance, if major members are in a position to do so, they will operate under NATO's framework while leading major offensive military interventions to further their influence and protect their interests as they did in Iraq, Bosnia, Serbia, Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nThe Russian leadership has every reason to worry about NATO, in the past, the US and the EU trio of France, the UK and eventually Germany, were well aware of this and every potential step made that would threaten Russia's interests would be deeply considered and talked over with the Russians, such as the newly unified Germany's ascension to NATO way back. Things went off the rails when Yeltsin was ruling and continued even when Putin came to power as he was initially considered a weak player, while the Europeans, especially Germany, stuck to the old mindset, the US started writing Russia off as a non-factor. This resulted in the Visegr\u00e1d group and the Vilnius group, both major enlargements that brought the anti-Russia alliance right to Russia's doorstep without even trying to negotiate with the Russians about the issue. \n\nThe watershed moment comes with the 2008 Bucharest summit, where against the advice of Germany and France, the US under Bush is pushing for further NATO expansion in Georgia and Ukraine, again, without even giving a single thought to Russia's obvious concerns. This was an incredibly dumb move, and much like how China would act if North Korea were to join NATO or how the US would act if Canada became directly aligned with China or was looking to join the CSTO, Russia also acted, by invading Georgia. Years later when an otherwise grassroots movement gets the direct support of the US (again, in spite of the EU's wishes) and undemocratically displaces the ruling Kremlin aligned government in Ukraine, Russia interferes again. \n\nUltimately I think countries that ended up ascending to the EU-NATO are in a better place than they would be under Russia for sure, but NATO, the US in particular, had the power to compromise, negotiate, prevent Georgia, Crimea and the Ukraine war, instead, against the advice of their allies, they pushed relentlessly to further their own influence until Putin made his move to counter their efforts in the most direct way possible after it's been provent that Russia can't protect their interests any other way, as tragic as it is I see this as a very obvious and rational move that any worthwhile leader would've also made in the same situation. \n\nAnother key point of this debate is whether we should or should've cared about Russia's concerns, interests and so on, that every single great power has to an extent. The American consensus seems to be an obvious no, but if it must be so, then I wish they would also connect the dots and see how their actions up until now, played an important role in things getting to this point, but the mere consideration of that labels anyone presenting the notion a Russian bot or whatever instead.\n\nHow could a country that has the entire Western hemisphere as it's playground, where they either crush any sign of dissent or completely cripple any opposition to their rule, ever misunderstand great power politics to the point where it doesn't even occur to them that other countries also have their own concerns, interests and desire to spread influence, is beyond me.\n\nBeyond the horrors of war, the history of Putin's regime, the social and economical improvement in countries that did join EU and NATO, I still see terrible misplays by NATO, primarily by the US, all of which had a significant role in letting things get to this point, that is if they aren't the main cause of all of this to begin with which is certainly something that's argued by many and I can see why even if I disagree with that.

Both cities had the advantage of being an urban defense, which gains a major edge for the defender. That said, Severodonetsk wasn't a very good tactical defensive position because the city was directly being attacked from three sides since May and the river, the best defensible terrain feature to base a defense on, was at its rear. \n\nLysychansk was actually a great tactical defensive position, as long as the Russians couldn't cross the Donets to the north or south of it to outflank it, or cut it's supply lines (Popasna thrust). The city was based on high ground that dominated the Donets river to the east, which would have been two major imposing obstacles for the Russians to advance through, especially if the bridges were lost. And if they crossed those obstacles they run into a major city.\n\nHad the UAF withdrawn their tactical forces used in Severodonetsk earlier and defended Lysychansk instead, the defensive line would only need to be equal to the frontage of the city and river, a straight line, with their flanks secured by other units also defending the river front. Which means the tactical command holding that section of the overall operational line needs far less troops than if they were still in Severodonetsk, who had to form a long reverse U shaped line in the outskirts and the centerof the city to counter Russian advances from three direction. In terms of the frontage length, definitely far fewer troops would need to defend it; my guess is ~1/3 as many troops needed in Lysychansk than Severodonetsk just based on how long the line was. \n\nOnce you factor in the additional tactical advantage of defending from high ground and from behind a river, that means the short frontage of Lysychansk would have needed even less troops to defend against an uphill river crossing that could only come from the direction of Severodonetsk. That could mean as few as 1/8 the amount of troops needed to cover that frontage. Plus, being that they possessed so many tactical advantages, even barely trained TDF could have held that line with light casualties because they wouldn't be defending against any ground probes attacking their positions (only possible if the RU can successfully cross the river and assault the heights where the defensive line is situated). Theyd just need a few forward observers with working radios who could call in fires to smash any river crossing with only a limited number of registered mortars and arty needed, with barely any direct fire from the defensive lines to repel an attack, since it would be an uphill river crossing being hit by IDF. The Lysychansk defenders only threat would be Russian indirect fires directed by drones, no small matter but still making for a much quieter section of the line that the Russians would have almost no hope of frontally advancing through.\n\nThat would mean the tactical command running that frontage of the salient would have surplus manpower available that could either be put into the operational reserve or be given to other sectors of the operational area to reinforce the line at places like around Popasna or Nyzhnje, who had they been stronger, a successful Russian breakthroughs would have been harder to achieve. \n\nAnd thus Lysychansk doesn't get outflanked and abandoned in early July after extremely heavy losses.\n\n>As mentioned above, the salient wasn't good for sustained defensive, that's why it was abandoned.\n\nAs [this ISW map indicates](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20July%208%2C2022.png) UAF are still in a salient. Just not as deep as before because they abandoned Severodonetsk when they were pushed out of it, and then abandoned the whole Donets defensive line including  Lysychansk when they were outflanked and threatened with encirclement from the joint Popasna and Nyzhnje-Toshkivka axes.\n\n>Ukraine's best bet is to catch Russians on Slovyansk-Kramatorsk line which is heavily fortified and much more suitable for defense.\n\nI agree, the N20 road defensive line would likely be very good because so many of the cities are fortified as are the areas in between. The two issues are strategic and operational\n\nStrategically, the UAF govt is extremely reluctant to give up any ground unless militarily forced out of it after every attempt to hold it, so they won't want to give up the Siversk-Bakhmut line, or the Sloviansk-Bakhmut line without a heavy fight.\n\nOperationally, if the Russians can outflank the N20 road and get around it they can bypass the entire Slovyansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka line. For example, the Russians have two ongoing breakout attempts from the Izyum axis and Avdiivka that are an attempt to bypass the entire N20 road from north and south that have been ongoing for up to four months. The Russians will still likely need to put some frontal pressure on the salient to keep UAF troops bottled up, but they wouldn't need to conduct a full scale frontal assault, it would just need to be a holding action.\n\nThough we are talking about the Russians, who often do not follow common sense. So they'll likely commit way too much manpower and resources to take those cities by assault as they did Severodonetsk, which made no sense.",

That said, Severodonetsk wasn&#39;t a very good tactical defensive position because the city was directly being attacked from three sides since May and the river, the best defensible terrain feature to base a defense on, was at its rear. </p>\n\n<p>Lysychansk was actually a great tactical defensive position, as long as the Russians couldn&#39;t cross the Donets to the north or south of it to outflank it, or cut it&#39;s supply lines (Popasna thrust). The city was based on high ground that dominated the Donets river to the east, which would have been two major imposing obstacles for the Russians to advance through, especially if the bridges were lost. And if they crossed those obstacles they run into a major city.</p>\n\n<p>Had the UAF withdrawn their tactical forces used in Severodonetsk earlier and defended Lysychansk instead, the defensive line would only need to be equal to the frontage of the city and river, a straight line, with their flanks secured by other units also defending the river front. Which means the tactical command holding that section of the overall operational line needs far less troops than if they were still in Severodonetsk, who had to form a long reverse U shaped line in the outskirts and the centerof the city to counter Russian advances from three direction. In terms of the frontage length, definitely far fewer troops would need to defend it; my guess is ~1/3 as many troops needed in Lysychansk than Severodonetsk just based on how long the line was. </p>\n\n<p>Once you factor in the additional tactical advantage of defending from high ground and from behind a river, that means the short frontage of Lysychansk would have needed even less troops to defend against an uphill river crossing that could only come from the direction of Severodonetsk. That could mean as few as 1/8 the amount of troops needed to cover that frontage. Plus, being that they possessed so many tactical advantages, even barely trained TDF could have held that line with light casualties because they wouldn&#39;t be defending against any ground probes attacking their positions (only possible if the RU can successfully cross the river and assault the heights where the defensive line is situated). Theyd just need a few forward observers with working radios who could call in fires to smash any river crossing with only a limited number of registered mortars and arty needed, with barely any direct fire from the defensive lines to repel an attack, since it would be an uphill river crossing being hit by IDF. The Lysychansk defenders only threat would be Russian indirect fires directed by drones, no small matter but still making for a much quieter section of the line that the Russians would have almost no hope of frontally advancing through.</p>\n\n<p>That would mean the tactical command running that frontage of the salient would have surplus manpower available that could either be put into the operational reserve or be given to other sectors of the operational area to reinforce the line at places like around Popasna or Nyzhnje, who had they been stronger, a successful Russian breakthroughs would have been harder to achieve. </p>\n\n<p>And thus Lysychansk doesn&#39;t get outflanked and abandoned in early July after extremely heavy losses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As mentioned above, the salient wasn&#39;t good for sustained defensive, that&#39;s why it was abandoned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Donetsk%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20July%208%2C2022.png\">this ISW map indicates</a> UAF are still in a salient. Just not as deep as before because they abandoned Severodonetsk when they were pushed out of it, and then abandoned the whole Donets defensive line including  Lysychansk when they were outflanked and threatened with encirclement from the joint Popasna and Nyzhnje-Toshkivka axes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s best bet is to catch Russians on Slovyansk-Kramatorsk line which is heavily fortified and much more suitable for defense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree, the N20 road defensive line would likely be very good because so many of the cities are fortified as are the areas in between. The two issues are strategic and operational</p>\n\n<p>Strategically, the UAF govt is extremely reluctant to give up any ground unless militarily forced out of it after every attempt to hold it, so they won&#39;t want to give up the Siversk-Bakhmut line, or the Sloviansk-Bakhmut line without a heavy fight.</p>\n\n<p>Operationally, if the Russians can outflank the N20 road and get around it they can bypass the entire Slovyansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka line. For example, the Russians have two ongoing breakout attempts from the Izyum axis and Avdiivka that are an attempt to bypass the entire N20 road from north and south that have been ongoing for up to four months. The Russians will still likely need to put some frontal pressure on the salient to keep UAF troops bottled up, but they wouldn&#39;t need to conduct a full scale frontal assault, it would just need to be a holding action.</p>\n\n<p>Though we are talking about the Russians, who often do not follow common sense. So they&#39;ll likely commit way too much manpower and resources to take those cities by assault as they did Severodonetsk, which made no sense.</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;ve explained to you that result is likely because Putin doesn&#39;t want to die. I&#39;ve explained to you that result is likely because historically nuclear powers don&#39;t resort to nukes when faced with defeats.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t seem to really pay attention to these parts of my posts that are specifically what you say you are looking for. I&#39;m not clear why.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Which commits you to being prepared to do...something. Thank you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No. Because, again, you get to choose when and if to react. You don&#39;t have to respond in every instance. You may want to respond in every instance. You have the option to respond in every instance. You don&#39;t have the obligation to respond, or prepare to respond, in every instance to maintain the deterrence.</p>\n</div>",
