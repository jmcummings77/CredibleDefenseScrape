US Army war college [estimated](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2875&context=parameters) the time needed to form \"decently\" capable combat brigades in the event of a major war with a major power. Few examples: ***4-6 months to assemble, equip and basically train*** (with the right number of officers and good trainers, etc.) an armored brigade, and ***at least 9 more months*** of training for it to be minimally ready (to combat). Some could say: ok, but that would be a standard for the US Army. Yes, and this is one of the main reasons russian invasion is crumbling: they train their soldiers in the russian way. Hard to imagine what 2-4 weeks of basic training to 35 year olds could make when even elite forces were crushed before.\n2. An [amateur tentative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhgVrKJJoA) to count all effectively usable tanks in russian reserves etc. Mind: usable = ready, restorable and all those vehicles with a minimum level of capability, that don't break immediately after 5 miles from the base, but ranging from \"good condition\" to \"barely decent\". He estimates around ***3000 of such tanks***. Another report, more detailed, made by some analysts put that number at more, ***3000-4000*** IIRC. As soon as i find the link, i will be edit the comment and add it. Surely a number not to be discounted, but nowhere near to even minimally equip several hundreds of thousands of units (and obviously, let alone the \"2 weeks basic training\" to train a tank crew). IIRC, russia actually had a capability to produce ***some tens or 100-150*** of tanks (for his army) every year, so, no way to replace losses at the rate they're losing it. If someone has a better estimate for the production would be valuable.\n\nEdit: this is [the link](https://mil.in.ua/uk/blogs/analiz-zapasiv-tankiv-rf-na-bazah-zberigannya-za-uralom/) of the report i was talking before. It calculates between 2100 and 3400 tanks (nearer to 3000 probably). Thanks to u/-TheGreasyPole- that posted it with some highlights as reply to this comment.",

He estimates around <strong><em>3000 of such tanks</em></strong>. Another report, more detailed, made by some analysts put that number at more, <strong><em>3000-4000</em></strong> IIRC. As soon as i find the link, i will be edit the comment and add it. Surely a number not to be discounted, but nowhere near to even minimally equip several hundreds of thousands of units (and obviously, let alone the &quot;2 weeks basic training&quot; to train a tank crew). IIRC, russia actually had a capability to produce <strong><em>some tens or 100-150</em></strong> of tanks (for his army) every year, so, no way to replace losses at the rate they&#39;re losing it. If someone has a better estimate for the production would be valuable.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Edit: this is <a href=\"https://mil.in.ua/uk/blogs/analiz-zapasiv-tankiv-rf-na-bazah-zberigannya-za-uralom/\">the link</a> of the report i was talking before. It calculates between 2100 and 3400 tanks (nearer to 3000 probably). Thanks to <a href=\"/u/-TheGreasyPole-\">u/-TheGreasyPole-</a> that posted it with some highlights as reply to this comment.</p>\n</div>",

Under this \"North Korea\" scenario, Russia is envisaged to remain a hostile actor to the West and to Europe especially, in the domains such as nuclear sabre-rattling, cyberwarfare, political influence, funding of terrorism, and so on.\n\nWhat should the West's response be to this new threat on its doorstep? One obvious possibility would be to accelerate and strengthen [the NATO missile defense program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_missile_defence_system). While the kinetics of a 99%+ intercept rate remain extremely challenging, a limited missile defense shield capable of reliably intercepting a small number of targets is vastly more technologically viable now than in Reagan's era.  Indeed, the fundamentals of such capabilities are arguably already in place, with  Aegis Ashore batteries in Romania and Poland (soon to become operational), THAAD batteries are active in Turkey, and Patriot systems in Germany, Spain, Greece, Poland, Romania, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Slovakia. While there has been persistent concern among NATO powers that a missile defense system would risk antagonising Russia, the changing geopolitical environment means that many European governments may be politically and financially willing to commit to accelerating the shield.\n\nWhat of developments in hypersonics and decoy tech? While these do pose challenges, in the case of Russia at least, the Ukraine war suggests that many of their vaunted capabilities may be mere vaporware, or at least perform well below claimed performance measures. Moreover, [other technological developments in fields like AI](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2730215/vice-admiral-discusses-potential-of-ai-in-missile-defense-testing-operations/) have strengthened defensive capabilities.\n\nWhat would the point of all this be? In addition to providing NATO with a better way to prevent nuclear bullying by Russia of its neighbours, and to defend against rogue international actors, we might reasonably hope to present Russia with a painful dilemma much like that faced by the Soviet Union in the light of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative: either commit to an arms race that it can ill afford, or risk its nuclear capabilities being de-fanged by a more technologically-advanced West. If anything, Russia's current position is worse than that of the Soviet Union in this regard, given its relatively weaker scientific and industrial base and etiolated conventional forces. And whereas Reagan's SDI was mostly pie-in-the-sky thinking in the 1980s, contemporary missile defense boasts impressive and growing capabilities.\n\nOf course, absent any miracle breakthroughs, it remains unlikely that any missile defense shield in the near- or medium-term would be able to withstand a massed nuclear strike involving hundreds or even thousands of warheads. However, the old principles of mutually assured destruction mean that this is not the most pressing nuclear threat that is faced by the West today. Instead, we face the risk of an increasingly isolated, weakened, and aggressive Russia using nuclear weapons in a more restricted capacity to gain battlefield advantages or to coerce its neighbours. Even a limited shield would be useful in combating these threats, and may help contribute in the longer-term to the downfall of Russia's current regime.",

        "body": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/world/europe/ukraine-south-kherson-russia.html\n\nAT THE KHERSON FRONT, Ukraine \u2014 The commander banged on the door furiously.\n\n\u201cI need help!\u201d he shouted.\n\nWhen Tetiana Kozyr opened up, the commander rushed in, carrying a young soldier on his shoulders. She said the young man was sunburned, thin and gravely wounded.\n\nThe Ukrainians were trying to recapture her village, the smallest dot on the most detailed military maps. Russian forces had just blown up three Ukrainian tanks. Flames leaped off the roofs of neighboring houses.\n\nThe commander laid the young man gently down on Ms. Kozyr\u2019s kitchen floor and then ripped open a bandage pack and thrust it against his chest and neck, which were badly bleeding. Ms. Kozyr hovered over them, feeling helpless and terrified in her own kitchen, watching the commander try to save the young man\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cHe looked so scared,\u201d said Ms. Kozyr, who lived on a small farm and recounted this scene, which was corroborated by others from her village. \u201cI had to turn away.\u201d\n\nOutside her house, several other Ukrainian soldiers lay face down in the grass.\n\nUkraine\u2019s southern offensive was the most highly anticipated military action of the summer. Forecast by Ukrainian officials for weeks, its goal was to push the Russians back from a strategic region along the coast, bolster the confidence of a battered citizenry and prove to allies that Ukraine could make good use of Western-supplied weapons.\n\nThat push forward has continued, even as Ukraine has made a more dramatic surge this month in the northeast, routing Russian forces. Ukraine is regaining territory in the south, though slowly, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is concerned enough about suffering an embarrassing setback that he has refused to let his commanders retreat from the city of Kherson, according to American officials.\n\nBut overall, the south remains a different story from the northeast. Interviews with dozens of commanders, ordinary soldiers, medics, village leaders and civilians who recently escaped the conflict zone portray a more difficult and costly campaign: The fighting is grinding, grueling and steep in casualties, perhaps the most heartbreaking battle in Ukraine right now.\n\nRussian forces are deeply dug in here, and this weekend, the Kremlin is trying to cement its gains by holding highly contentious referendums in occupied areas to annex them. Ukrainian officials say they have little choice but to attack.\n\nThey are racing to recapture territory before the October rains turn the roads here into impassable sludge. And they need to keep showing to the world, especially before a nasty winter sets in and tests their allies\u2019 resolve, that they can push the Russians out.\n\nThe Ukrainian government does not usually disclose casualty figures, but the soldiers and commanders interviewed in the past week portrayed the battlefield losses as \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cmassive.\u201d They described large offensives in which columns of Ukrainian tanks and armored vehicles tried to cross open fields only to be pounded mercilessly by Russian artillery and blown up by Russian mines.\n\nOne Ukrainian soldier, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to publicly discuss casualties, said that during a recent assault, \u201cwe lost 50 guys in two hours.\u201d In another place, said the soldier, who works closely with different frontline units, \u201chundreds\u201d of Ukrainian troops were killed or wounded while trying to take a single village, which is still in Russian hands.\n\nAcross the occupied south \u2014 a wide crescent of fields, villages and cities along the Dnipro River and the Black Sea \u2014 the Russians have built formidable defenses: trenches zigzagging along irrigation canals; fortified bunkers; pillboxes; foxholes; even tank trenches carved out of the earth by bulldozers and covered with concrete slabs that enable the Russians to blast shells from positions that are very difficult for the Ukrainians to hit.\n\nThe Russians are determined to keep this chunk of Ukraine because it guards the Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. It also serves as a nexus of vital waterways and energy facilities, like the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s biggest.\n\nDespite the high stakes, there is little face-to-face combat between the two sides, like there was in the early days of the war in the suburbs of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. Each Ukrainian soldier along the southern front carries an assault rifle, but few have fired their weapon.\n\nIn the south, death comes at long range. It is indiscriminate and total. When the artillery shells hit, young men press themselves to the earth, hands cupped over their ears, mouths open to let the blast wave ripple through their bodies.\n\n\u201cThis is a different kind of war,\u201d said Iryna Vereshchagina, a volunteer doctor working near the front lines. \u201cWe\u2019re attacking the Russians but there\u2019s a big payment for this.\u201d\n\nShe said that of the hundreds of battlefield casualties she has treated, she has not seen a single gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cSo many people are getting blown up,\u201d she said.\n\nShe looked down at her boots.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, \u201cthere are just pieces of people left.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason Ukraine is facing stiff resistance in the south is because of its highly effective information campaign about the counteroffensive. The signals it sent were so convincing that the Russians hastily redeployed tanks, artillery and thousands of troops, including some of their better trained units, from the northeast to the south.\n\nThat left the Kharkiv region wide open for the taking, which is what happened two and a half weeks ago. But it also left the south defended by tens of thousands of well-equipped Russian soldiers. And going on the attack is always more perilous than defending an entrenched position, especially when the enemy knows the other side is coming.\n\nAll of this has unsettled some Ukrainian soldiers fighting along the front line.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we are advancing with no artillery preparation, without suppressing their firing positions,\u201d said Ihor Kozub, the commander of a volunteer military unit near the southern city of Mykolaiv.\n\nHe said the Ukrainian army was suffering \u201cgreat losses\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t have ammunition,\u201d and he begged for the United States to send more.\n\n\u201cAll these heroic attacks are made with so much blood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nA military spokeswoman defended the Ukrainian strategy.\n\n\u201cThe enemy\u2019s superiority in artillery does not decide the outcome,\u201d said Nataliia Humeniuk, the head of the communications division for Ukraine\u2019s southern command. \u201cHistory knows cases of unique battles where the quality of combat was decisive. Not the number of weapons.\u201d\n\nShe did not provide information about the number of casualties, but Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently said that Ukraine was losing 50 soldiers a day.\n\n\u201cI try not to think about who he was,\u201d Pirate said.\n\nHe spoke from a demolished building near the front lines that has been turned into a base. This is the picture of many southern towns. They have been utterly destroyed: the schools, the homes with blown-out roofs, the power poles lying in the muddy roads, the pine trees split apart, their branches hanging down like broken arms.\n\nEven the earth itself has been gouged by missiles and rockets, leaving moonlike craters everywhere, some with steel fins still sticking out. The smell of dried sunflowers lingers in the air. So many sunflower farms, a major industry, lie burned and deserted.\n\nMs. Kozyr, who had watched the wounded soldier lying on her kitchen floor, said her village had been destroyed, too. It used to be a hamlet of a few hundred people who tended small farms and raised livestock. Now no one is left. The Russians captured it in March and the Ukrainians fought hard to liberate it at the end of August, when they officially announced the beginning of the offensive. She fled a few days later and now lives in a displaced persons shelter in the city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nShe said that when the commander first arrived with the wounded soldier, she panicked.\n\n\u201cI was yelling at him: \u2018Why did you bring him here? The Russians will kill us all!\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nBut the commander just stepped through the doorway, desperate to find shelter. The village was on fire, in the middle of two armies blasting each other.\n\nShe shrunk back as her husband and the commander pressed bandages to the young man\u2019s wounds. Shrapnel had sliced through his back and lungs. Her kitchen floor was soon covered in blood.\n\nThat night, she and her husband slept in their cellar. The commander curled up next to the wounded soldier on the kitchen floor.\n\nWhen Ms. Kozyr stepped outside the next morning, to check on her calf and pigs, she passed by the kitchen and peered through the window.\n\nThe soldier\u2019s hands were curled, his body stiff. He was dead.\n\nShe started crying at the memory of it, pulling a small rag out of her pocket and wiping her eyes. But she did not question the counteroffensive.\n\n\u201cIt needed to be done,\u201d she said. And then she repeated herself, a little more softly. \u201cIt needed to be done.\u201d",

And going on the attack is always more perilous than defending an entrenched position, especially when the enemy knows the other side is coming.</p>\n\n<p>All of this has unsettled some Ukrainian soldiers fighting along the front line.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe problem is that we are advancing with no artillery preparation, without suppressing their firing positions,\u201d said Ihor Kozub, the commander of a volunteer military unit near the southern city of Mykolaiv.</p>\n\n<p>He said the Ukrainian army was suffering \u201cgreat losses\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t have ammunition,\u201d and he begged for the United States to send more.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll these heroic attacks are made with so much blood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A military spokeswoman defended the Ukrainian strategy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe enemy\u2019s superiority in artillery does not decide the outcome,\u201d said Nataliia Humeniuk, the head of the communications division for Ukraine\u2019s southern command. \u201cHistory knows cases of unique battles where the quality of combat was decisive. Not the number of weapons.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She did not provide information about the number of casualties, but Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently said that Ukraine was losing 50 soldiers a day.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI try not to think about who he was,\u201d Pirate said.</p>\n\n<p>He spoke from a demolished building near the front lines that has been turned into a base. This is the picture of many southern towns. They have been utterly destroyed: the schools, the homes with blown-out roofs, the power poles lying in the muddy roads, the pine trees split apart, their branches hanging down like broken arms.</p>\n\n<p>Even the earth itself has been gouged by missiles and rockets, leaving moonlike craters everywhere, some with steel fins still sticking out. The smell of dried sunflowers lingers in the air. So many sunflower farms, a major industry, lie burned and deserted.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Kozyr, who had watched the wounded soldier lying on her kitchen floor, said her village had been destroyed, too. It used to be a hamlet of a few hundred people who tended small farms and raised livestock. Now no one is left. The Russians captured it in March and the Ukrainians fought hard to liberate it at the end of August, when they officially announced the beginning of the offensive. She fled a few days later and now lives in a displaced persons shelter in the city of Zaporizhzhia.</p>\n\n<p>She said that when the commander first arrived with the wounded soldier, she panicked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was yelling at him: \u2018Why did you bring him here? The Russians will kill us all!\u2019\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>But the commander just stepped through the doorway, desperate to find shelter. The village was on fire, in the middle of two armies blasting each other.</p>\n\n<p>She shrunk back as her husband and the commander pressed bandages to the young man\u2019s wounds. Shrapnel had sliced through his back and lungs. Her kitchen floor was soon covered in blood.</p>\n\n<p>That night, she and her husband slept in their cellar. The commander curled up next to the wounded soldier on the kitchen floor.</p>\n\n<p>When Ms. Kozyr stepped outside the next morning, to check on her calf and pigs, she passed by the kitchen and peered through the window.</p>\n\n<p>The soldier\u2019s hands were curled, his body stiff. He was dead.</p>\n\n<p>She started crying at the memory of it, pulling a small rag out of her pocket and wiping her eyes. But she did not question the counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt needed to be done,\u201d she said. And then she repeated herself, a little more softly. \u201cIt needed to be done.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

What does that earn them? Months of costly advances that keep shrinking the Russian frontages, making their line shorter (and easier to defend), ultimately leading to highly populated urban areas filled with civilians and infrastructure that Ukraine would rather not destroy. \n\nSo why aren't the UAF making great progress? They don't want to make progress if it means by assault, they never did, they want the Russians to voluntarily withdraw because they're in a very risky, potentially disastrous operational predicament.\n\nPoint 1, they attacked the bridges before the Russians even had a chance to start reinforcing it (probably as soon as UAF GenStab got a whiff of intel it was being planned). Point 2, when it became clear the Russian defenses were stout they openly declared a switch to a attrition based operational plan while pushing a political narrative that they didn't care about liberating ground and that they were willing to draw this operation out well into 2023. Both of those together are blatant signals to the Russians that whatever reasons they had to try to hold onto the Kherson bridgehead won't work.\n\n The NYT article, if true, backs up my theory.

They're doing it because Putin wants it, who had risky but legit political-strategic reasons that were still valid until last the Kharkiv counteroffensive.\n\nAll of this means the UAF don't need to create ground assault breakthroughs to push out the Russians, they just need to create the strategic situation that forces Putin to do the lesser of two evils, authorize the HIGHLY difficult withdraw across the Dnieper before a disaster happens instead of being stubborn and waiting till it's too late.\n\nThe good news is that multiple times in this war, the Kyiv-Chernihiv-Sumy fronts, Mykolaiv, the April-May UAF Kharkiv counteroffensive and the recent Kharkiv-Izyum counteroffensive, Putin authorized major withdraw before the Russians were truly screwed. He's often the reason they're in those predicaments in the first place but despite his clear stubbornness he's also flexible enough that he'll allow retreats when they're needed. So I think he's going to order the retreat from the Kherson bridgehead, it's just a matter of when.\n\nSince he probably cannot politically survive another major defeat so soon after the last, my money is that they're already in the planning stages to retreat. As retreats go, retrograde ops are among the hardest to pull off while doing it ordered and withdrawing the maximum amount of manpower, heavy equipment and supplies. The lack of bridges doesn't just hinder resupply, that's going to make it much worse to withdraw everything.

This is the likely scenario when the mobilized troops get to the front-lines.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKi3NwLFkX4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKi3NwLFkX4</a></p>\n</div>",

I think it's fair to assume that would represent their worst losses during this conflict, this was at the dark ages before HIMARS and I think they only released these figures to beg the West for better weapons. \n\nSo this 50 deaths/day figure is very interesting from an outsiders perspective trying to figure this out. From the [actual source](https://www.ouest-france.fr/europe/ukraine/volodymyr-zelensky/guerre-en-ukraine-kiev-perd-50-hommes-par-jour-annonce-volodymyr-zelensky-b6aa752a-3b2f-11ed-a6d4-69a981b2a43f), Zelensky clarifies this is a **minimum** figure which I'm glad to know. Over the 212 day war, that would otherwise equate to 10,600 Ukraine deaths. The problem arising with that figure is that back in June (*a few days after the 100-200 killed per day I just mentioned*), Kyiv released a figure of [10,000 dead Ukrainian soliders](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61764008?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=62a45eb8a48d0547a34bfcc2%2610%2C000%20Ukrainian%20soldiers%20killed%2C%20Kyiv%20says%262022-06-11T11%3A28%3A41.032Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:a87e683d-139b-43c4-9e75-e63f285d618c&pinned_post_asset_id=62a45eb8a48d0547a34bfcc2&pinned_post_type=share). \n\nSo was Kyiv perhaps **over-inflating** their death figures in early June to get better Western weapons? I would think not. If the 10k figure in June was accurate, then perhaps we are at 18-20k.

Certainly in WW2 plenty of japanese fishing boats were blasted by US submarines. </p>\n\n<p>If china did use a civilian ship to set up an ambush, they&#39;re signing the death warrant of any actual civilian ships, because after the first time it happens no one will give anyone the benefit of the doubt.</p>\n</div>",

The United States is a little further away from poland as Germany but they have good logistics and have no issue getting shit to Ukraine in bulk already and they can just send some mechanics from the US to Poland.</p>\n\n<p>They can also  spend one extra week of training the Ukrainians not to use it more than it was designed to be and the whole tank thing will be a piece of cake \ud83c\udf70. Itll go over even more smoothly than the PZH 2000 because PZH 2000 was already a piece of cake \ud83c\udf70 except for the part of the gun being used more than it was designed to be.</p>\n</div>",
