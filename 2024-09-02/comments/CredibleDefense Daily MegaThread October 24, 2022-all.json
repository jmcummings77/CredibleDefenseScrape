He also placed all Russian CBRN forces on readiness/high alert. In his briefing, Kirillov specifically tied the claims about dirty bombs to claims about Ukraine shelling the ZNPP and tied it directly to the US unilateral missile strikes on a Syria airbase in 2017 in response to chemical weapons usage, specifically stating that the US would do the same if Ukraine framed Russia with a dirty bomb.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the US defense briefing today ( [https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3197746/senior-military-official-holds-a-background-briefing/](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3197746/senior-military-official-holds-a-background-briefing/) ) lots of questions about nukes and dirty bombs, but the US remains adamant that it has seen no evidence to indicate that Russia is planning to use any CBRN weaponry in Ukraine or elsewhere.

                            "body": "Just speaking as someone who knows, I'd like to say that the F-16 is a \"no\" for a large number of reasons. The training pipeline is loooong and highly qualifications-driven, to where most who want to be stick jockeys don't make it there - even in the US. With the casualties suffered by the UAF, and the personnel-base to draw from, it's questionable whether there would even be a meaningful amount of candidates fit to fly those airframes into combat. Only then, with those deemed worthwhile and fit to train, could training begin. \n\nContrary to what the majority of the public think, you cannot just hop from DCS into an F-16 and expect to do anything other than start the thing. While Ukrainian trainees could skip a lot of the very fundamentals, and thus perhaps accelerate their Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) Phase 1 and 2 (and maybe 3) time by a measurable amount. However, even those encompass a lot of tactical knowledge and conceptual learning that can't just be fast-forwarded through. Lots of Computer Basic Training (CBT), textbooks, manuals, etc. that you just simply have to absorb, and which are critical for building the correct mindset.\n\nUkrainian training is notably different from our own in a wide wide variety of ways, and is oriented around the kind of jets they fly, as opposed to the ones we fly. This has measurable real world consequences in terms of the skillsets, learned behaviors and instincts, outlook, and overall effectiveness in the air when they hop into a viper instead of their own type of jet. Training this out of someone is not easy.\n\nOnce their accelerated UPT has concluded, and they're competent at basic military flying (in Phase III, for fighter-track guys in T-38s, it's a lot of formations, low level flying, navigation, blah blah et cetera) according to Uncle Sam (after maybe 4 months, as a very rough guess, compared to the year or so it typically takes), they'll probably skip SERE and get to go straight into Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF), where they learn the basics of tactical flying ***our*** way, including basic BFM and groundpounding competencies (BSA). This can leverage some of the Ukrainian pilots' skills, but a lot has to be built or rebuilt from the ground up to make full use of our aircraft in their intended tactical employment roles, so will probably take around the usual duration, 6-8 weeks.\n\nBeyond IFF, they're no longer ahead in any way, and the rest of the training can't be meaningfully bypassed. The F-16 B Course + MQT series is a long process of learning your aircraft, its mission systems, how everything interacts with everything else, tactical considerations and recommendations, sensor employment, munitions employment, and much much MUCH much more. When I say that civilian flight simmers don't know the half of it, and that DCS is hilarious, it's because I mean it. We don't take highly capable, qualified pilots and teach them for months and months just for the warm and fuzzies we get out of it. This is about an 8 and a half month course. Maybe it could be slimmed down to 7 if we've got Maverick in the cockpit.\n\nSo, we're looking at over a year of training time to get *anyone* into F-16s (which is why I laughed when I saw Ukraine claim they could run an accelerated conversion training in 2 to 3 weeks), so what does that get Ukraine?\n\nWell, Ukraine has already lost 20+ pilots, and even more aircraft, so it's unlikely that more than 50-60 pilots could be put into training on short notice. We'll presume 50 get selected and make it through the pipeline. Do note though, taking them out of the fight for a year or more has its own consequences. Typical API-1 crew ratio is 1.25:1 for F-16Cs, so odds are they'll be rocking 40 vipers for their efforts. \n\nThese 40 airframes are not free, however. Each aircraft requires (very) roughly \\~20 maintainer hours per flight hour to keep things kosher, which requires maintainers who have undergone their own training, which itself is an 18 month long investment before compression. While we often get as high as 25 maintainers per airframe (or higher, depending on various circumstances), it is at least *doable* to work a configuration of 8 to 12 per aircraft in the kind of combat flying Ukraine would experience. \n\nThis means after a minimum of a year, Ukraine gets 40 Vipers (probably just run of the mill post blocks, since anything else would be foolish for us to send, while anything older would be borderline counterproductive), 50 pilots, 320-480 maintainers, all the associated equipment and knick knacks needed to generate mission capable airframes, and the tools needed to effectively coordinate their employment. Sounds decent, right? Not really.\n\nFixed, major, centralized basing (highly preferable for operating US/Western aircraft) is unavailable, leaving austere operations as the only viable option. This absolutely plummets sortie rates, makes sustainment and coordination an order of magnitude more difficult, and majorly erodes western airpower's operational-level effectiveness. Further, the Air Force's active F-16 fleet still runs the APG-68(V)9, a pretty dated pulse doppler that we've strung along due mostly to funding problems, which - in lieu of our AEW&C apparatus - is less of a sensor and more of a beacon. Plus, despite how much the VKS has shown its behind during this conflict, they have appeared reasonably competent at the one thing they train for - tactical level counter-air engagements.\n\nWith all this in mind, the dozens of pilots and hundreds of maintainers kept out of the fight for over a year, the millions of dollars of enabling equipment, the (tens of) millions of dollars of munitions, the approximately 2 Billion USD worth of F-16s sent over, and the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars on training costs could be better directed instead of throwing it all into the (at most) 80-100 additional sorties per day you'd get after a year or more by sending F-16s, which will likely have a horrific rate of attrition, achieve very little, and only serve to damage the US's perceived capabilities in the minds of our allies, partners, and enemies alike.",

I have a good friend who is Ukrainian, and they have described their experience in 2014 to me, though it was much less extreme than yours. I am aware of how intense things were in 2014 and am not trying to downplay it.\n\nErica Chenoweth has estimated that at least 3.5% of a country's population needs to be involved in nonviolent protests to have a chance to obtain concessions from government. In Russia that translates to at least 5 million people. That scale of protest has not occurred in recent times in Russia - not even the major demonstrations in 2005-2007 or 2011-2013 came remotely close to those numbers.\n\nIf there were to be a popular revolution in Russia that started peacefully, it would likely need to have at least six times the number of participants from the Ukraine revolution in 2014. It would be virtually incomparable in scale, not only from the number of protestors, but due to the sheer size of the Russian state security apparatus, which is one of the largest and most developed in the entire world. The corresponding numbers of deaths and arrests in any violent crackdown would be catastrophic.\n\nAll I'm trying to say is that, while there are definitely similarities, there are enough differences that they aren't perfectly comparable on a 1:1 scale, and that makes the decision-making experienced by an average citizen different. But I agree fully that we need to hold people accountable for their governments.

        "body": "We should look at the dirty bomb warnings in the context of other Russian warnings: with the ZNPP meltdown threats from shelling earlier this summer, and at the start of the conflict. For the latter, I'm pretty sure most everyone has forgotten it, but Russia the week prior to Feb 24 was menacing that a chemical attack would be committed by the Ukrainians in the Donbass. The US intel community picked up on this, and warned of a Russian false flag on civilians. In each of these three cases: no actual attack, false flag or otherwise, took place, which leads to me to believe the same will happen in this latest case.\n\nAll that's left is to puzzle why Russia is doing this and continues to stir up panic over things that won't happen. Here are all the options I see:\n\n1) To indeed create a panic in the West and Ukraine. As time progresses, and as nothing happens, this will have a diminishing, 'boy who cries wolf' effect. \n\n2) To create a pretext for a Russian false flag. This one I'm iffy about, because it would imply that Russians are ready to escalate to WMDs, and they know as well as the world that no one would buy it, not even their allies in China. \n\n3) They are drunk on their own Kool Aid, meaning that there is a significant contigent of the Russian government that truly does believe that Ukraine is a Nazi regime. What do Nazis do? False flag attacks, breaking all international laws in the process. Insofar as how it could play out: this is pure speculation, but imagine if Russians signals intelligence picked up random shit-posting from a Ukrainian soldier to the tune of \"ahh man, I wish we could nuke Kherson's dam and drown the fuckers\". Who's to say a credulous Russian intel officer, already cowed by flopping majorly in February wouldn't report it up, and it somehow ends up in Putin and Shoigu's lap, much distilled from the original report? The lowly intel officer wouldn't want to dismiss even the unlikeliest of reports, considering the big misses at the start of the op, and that would echo up the chain. And Putin/Shoigu, having had cracked down hard on intel services and furthermore believing they are in a holy struggle against Western NATO fascism, would eagerly believe that their evil enemies are itching for nuclear weapons, and with NATO already supplying advanced arms, dirty bombs aren't far from that equation.\n\nMy pet theory is #3, though of course I and everyone else (save Putin and his inner circle) lack definitive proof for any of them. In the context of the other scares this year (ZNPP and the week prior to the invasion), it's again plausible that it was a case of Russian leaders catastrophizing against an enemy they don't quite understand. They assume the worst (because they see their enemies as irrational, evil Nazis), and then warn the world about the upcoming plots. Russia assumes Ukraine will legitimately attack, while the world assumes it's all either a psych op or a false flag pretext. Meanwhile, confusion reigns and neither side remains true.",

For the latter, I&#39;m pretty sure most everyone has forgotten it, but Russia the week prior to Feb 24 was menacing that a chemical attack would be committed by the Ukrainians in the Donbass. The US intel community picked up on this, and warned of a Russian false flag on civilians. In each of these three cases: no actual attack, false flag or otherwise, took place, which leads to me to believe the same will happen in this latest case.</p>\n\n<p>All that&#39;s left is to puzzle why Russia is doing this and continues to stir up panic over things that won&#39;t happen. Here are all the options I see:</p>\n\n<p>1) To indeed create a panic in the West and Ukraine. As time progresses, and as nothing happens, this will have a diminishing, &#39;boy who cries wolf&#39; effect. </p>\n\n<p>2) To create a pretext for a Russian false flag. This one I&#39;m iffy about, because it would imply that Russians are ready to escalate to WMDs, and they know as well as the world that no one would buy it, not even their allies in China. </p>\n\n<p>3) They are drunk on their own Kool Aid, meaning that there is a significant contigent of the Russian government that truly does believe that Ukraine is a Nazi regime. What do Nazis do? False flag attacks, breaking all international laws in the process. Insofar as how it could play out: this is pure speculation, but imagine if Russians signals intelligence picked up random shit-posting from a Ukrainian soldier to the tune of &quot;ahh man, I wish we could nuke Kherson&#39;s dam and drown the fuckers&quot;. Who&#39;s to say a credulous Russian intel officer, already cowed by flopping majorly in February wouldn&#39;t report it up, and it somehow ends up in Putin and Shoigu&#39;s lap, much distilled from the original report? The lowly intel officer wouldn&#39;t want to dismiss even the unlikeliest of reports, considering the big misses at the start of the op, and that would echo up the chain. And Putin/Shoigu, having had cracked down hard on intel services and furthermore believing they are in a holy struggle against Western NATO fascism, would eagerly believe that their evil enemies are itching for nuclear weapons, and with NATO already supplying advanced arms, dirty bombs aren&#39;t far from that equation.</p>\n\n<p>My pet theory is #3, though of course I and everyone else (save Putin and his inner circle) lack definitive proof for any of them. In the context of the other scares this year (ZNPP and the week prior to the invasion), it&#39;s again plausible that it was a case of Russian leaders catastrophizing against an enemy they don&#39;t quite understand. They assume the worst (because they see their enemies as irrational, evil Nazis), and then warn the world about the upcoming plots. Russia assumes Ukraine will legitimately attack, while the world assumes it&#39;s all either a psych op or a false flag pretext. Meanwhile, confusion reigns and neither side remains true.</p>\n</div>",

Most of their first line of defenses are lost and often second line too in some areas, whereas the entire eastern section is totally new defensive lines, which means they suck.\n\nI am not aware of any recent Ukrainian progress on the western part of the bridgehead, along the ~100km stretch that goes from Aleksandrovka (on the coast) to the area along the Ingulets southwest of Andriivka and east of Snigurevka. That sector stabilized during the spring and the defenses there have not yet, to my knowledge, been breached.\n\nThey have been able to hold their new lines in the eastern sector between Mylove and Brukynske following the sudden retreat 3 weeks ago - those do not appear to have budged since, despite significant and repeated AFU attacks that were repelled with serious losses. It might be where their third defensive ligne had been prepared during the summer, given its sensible location for that purpose and the highened vulnerability of the northern Kherson sector compared to the rest of that front. Likewise, the Andriivka sector has remained static for over a month, though the first lines around the Ingulets were breached in early September.\n\nI think the assessment of the feasability of a long-term defense of the Kherson bridgehead is largely contingent on factors that are mostly unknown to us (mainly, the correlation of manpower and equipment on that front, as well as the losses suffered by each side). Both have obviously lost a lot, but I don't think I have seen enough evidence on the degree of attrition of Russian troops (locally) to take a firm stance on whether the bridgehead is irremediably doomed.

Most of their first line of defenses are lost and often second line too in some areas, whereas the entire eastern section is totally new defensive lines, which means they suck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not aware of any recent Ukrainian progress on the western part of the bridgehead, along the ~100km stretch that goes from Aleksandrovka (on the coast) to the area along the Ingulets southwest of Andriivka and east of Snigurevka. That sector stabilized during the spring and the defenses there have not yet, to my knowledge, been breached.</p>\n\n<p>They have been able to hold their new lines in the eastern sector between Mylove and Brukynske following the sudden retreat 3 weeks ago - those do not appear to have budged since, despite significant and repeated AFU attacks that were repelled with serious losses. It might be where their third defensive ligne had been prepared during the summer, given its sensible location for that purpose and the highened vulnerability of the northern Kherson sector compared to the rest of that front. Likewise, the Andriivka sector has remained static for over a month, though the first lines around the Ingulets were breached in early September.</p>\n\n<p>I think the assessment of the feasability of a long-term defense of the Kherson bridgehead is largely contingent on factors that are mostly unknown to us (mainly, the correlation of manpower and equipment on that front, as well as the losses suffered by each side). Both have obviously lost a lot, but I don&#39;t think I have seen enough evidence on the degree of attrition of Russian troops (locally) to take a firm stance on whether the bridgehead is irremediably doomed.

We got decent drone footage for both of them.\n\nFor the push on the 19th:\n\n* [Drone footage showing artillery blunting the attack on one sector.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOLmPDhSX84) (geoloc is 47.175989, 33.546021).

If the Berislav sector or others were on the verge of collapse, I don't think they would have been able to repel the attacks last week, and Ukraine would probably have committed more forces there or elsewhere to immediately push their advantage as much as they could - 2 weeks ago was the best time to do that imo, as Russia was on the backfoot everywhere and it was still too early to deploy mobilized men even as cannon fodder.\n\n> We know both sides lost a lot, but we also know that Russia can't properly rotate units or reinforce with more as they are suffering major manning and force reconstitution problems that aren't going to be fixed anytime soon.

This would essentially be similar to what Ukraine did in May / June, when territorial defense units sent to Donbass helped delay Russian advances long enough to prevent major losses by the time reinforcements arrived.\n\nCan they last that long in Kherson, and will the mobilized troops be well-trained, equipped and motivated enough to stabilize that front in the long-term?

            "body": "As others are pointing out, dirty bombs dont really work like that. More youre looking at a significant enough concentration to cause problems over a small area. MOPP protocols *should* basically blunt the impact of these attacks. \n\nBasically, unlike a fission or fusion device, a dirty bomb is something primed with a conventional explosive and **does not produce a nuclear reaction**. At least, not of the kind you may be thinking of. Another name for a dirty bomb is a fizzle, if youre thinking of a nuclear warhead which fails to go off. Because there is no fission or fusion reaction, the nuclear material is not consumed and thus an amount of radiological material is blast into the air. This creates a significant contamination risk, and typically these contaminats are dangerous if a person comes into contact with them or, more importantly, breaths significant amounts in. But this kind of contamination is pretty narrowly confined, a contaminated zone may only be immediately dangerous over a mile or two of space. This is because virtually all fissile materials are heavier than air, and most significantly so. So they tend to fall out of a cloud quickly. Because your primarily worried about surface contamination, significant decon measures (including scrubbing and spraying) can restore vehicles and infrastructure to military service rapidly. Troops need to observe proper radiological precautions, but probably the threat of this kind of weapon is low. Against military targets. A dirty bomb detonated over NYC would spread dangerous contaminants over one of the most densely populated spaces on Earth and could place hundreds of thousands at risk. This is why radiological terrorism is a significant consideration for counter-terrorism forces, and why dirty bombs are oft the topic of modern spy thrillers. In a military sense, the dirty bomb hasn't been a concern since the 1950s. \n\nIts also worth pointing out that the lack of an accelerated nuclear reaction means you dont get a lot of the knock on effects they produce. Its worth keeping in mind that, from a physics perspective, even a multi-kiloton bomb is a significant event which represents the release of large quantities of energy. A lot of that energy turns into kinetic energy, via the shock wave, and heat. But chunks of it also go into gamma radiation which becomes significant and sustained. This is increased an order of magnitude with fusion devices, and another order of magnitude with specially designed high radiation fusion devices. You may have heard the saying, if you can see the flash youre already dead. This is not because the plutonium itself is that dangerous, it is but only if youre very close. Rather, the fusion event produces *so much* excess energy that the gamma flash is very likely to give you a fatal dose of radiation right away. A dirty bomb doesn't do that. Because the materials dont reach critical mass, the energy release is rather conventional in magnitude. Like I said, were talking about *significant* contamination. It would probably kill unprotected troops relatively quickly. But very confined, and very manageable with the right equipment and training. \n\nBecause of the significance of decontamination procedures, however, I find it hard to believe Russia would use a bomb on its own forces. Youre talking about a serious event, unprecedented, which would require a significant amount of clean up from well trained specialist troops. This may well overstrain Russian troops and do more harm then good. Youre probably talking about knocking a major formation out of the line for days. Its just not really very feasible. And the thought of using a radiological device on a civilian population, Ukrainian or Russian, is a thing so monstrous that I cant really contemplate it. You might as well release plague or monkey pox, it would be that destructive. Were talking about some real Nazi/Imperial Japan type shit. I just dont see it. IMO Russia doesnt need justification to use their own nuke. They will if they want to, if they feel they have to, or they wont. This talk of dirty bombs is just there to make the Ukrainian's look like monsters, its the same as the biolab conspiracies of a few months ago. Chalk this up to a nothingburger until something real happens.",

Because there is no fission or fusion reaction, the nuclear material is not consumed and thus an amount of radiological material is blast into the air.\n\nTo be somewhat pedantic I have two corrections. \n\nFirst, a fizzle is not a dirty bomb. They can of course produce similar effects but you can create a dirty bomb based around a radionuclide that you would never use for a warhead such as caesium-137 of Goi\u00e2nia fame. Simply packing your radiological material around a conventional explosive is sufficient for a crude device, none of the complexity of even a gun-type warhead is necessary. \n\nSecond, a fizzle does not imply that there has been no nuclear reaction. While it is possible for a fission weapon to utterly fail to have any nuclear reaction, any partial reaction is also considered a fizzle. In a more extreme case, in a thermonuclear warhead even complete detonation of the fission primary is a fizzle assuming the fusion secondary fails. It's not uncommon for a fizzle to still produce kt of yield.",

It would become immediately obvious upon even slightly more complex monitoring that the bomb posed no long term threat even in the affected area.

            "body": "Can\u2019t say in general but I do have something on Wagner\u2019s defensive line. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/coupsure/status/1580192286348279809?s=46&t=BS9bR7LeU4xRrNGfPtXlow\n\nhttps://twitter.com/coupsure/status/1580192296502726657?s=46&t=BS9bR7LeU4xRrNGfPtXlow\n\nThe first line of trenches seems to be rather straight. However, this is not true of the second line of trenches does possess a zig-zag pattern. \n\nSo, why is the first line of trenches straight while the second are not? Well, the pragmatic answer is that the trenching machine can\u2019t create zig-zag trenches. In other words, it is a glorified bulldozer. In fact, you can see the deposited dirt above the first line of trenches. I am guessing that the second line of trenches was manually dug using good old shovels which would take much longer to construct. That is also probably why the second line of trenches does not cover the whole length of the first line: they take time to build.\n\nMost of the time, soldiers don\u2019t have the luxury of having enough time to dig an elaborate trench system. Best they can do is dig foxholes and have them join together to build a trench.\n\nWhen they have enough time, you do see zig-zag trenches being dug.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/geoconfirmed/status/1578033252279144454?s=46&t=BS9bR7LeU4xRrNGfPtXlow\n\nAs the tweet states, this is a trench built north of the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Kherson region. The Russians have had enough time to build a relatively more complex trench system. \n\nAlthough the zig-zag pattern isn\u2019t as dense as some WWI trenches, it still gets the job done. Compartmentalize the damage caused by an explosive landing in the trench, whether that be from artillery or a drone.\n\nEdit 1: \nExample of WWI Trench: https://twitter.com/bonsens47865369/status/1580371617212866560?s=46&t=BS9bR7LeU4xRrNGfPtXlow\n\nThe other answer is that the first line of trenches are simply a ditch. The dragon\u2019s teeth obstructions can be destroyed with artillery fire so the first line of trenches act as a ditch in an attempt to get advancing vehicles stuck or at least expose a more vulnerable portion of the vehicle while the second line of trenches sends whatever they got at the stuck vehicle. \n\nI don\u2019t have much on the Ukrainian side. I may update this comment in the future though.\n\nEdit 2: \nSummary:\n\nZig-zag styled trenches are present in Ukraine even though they are much less complex than their First World War counterparts. They are present in areas where soldiers have enough time and resources to build them.  This is due to the increased time it takes to dig a zig-zag trench compared to a straight trench. Examples of zig-zag trenches includes that defensive line Wagner is making in the Donbas region and some of the trenches north of Nova Kakhovka dam. Both examples are defensive positions that have had a good amount of time to fortify. \n\nUnfortunately time is a luxury for both sides of the conflict. So sometimes there simply isn\u2019t enough time to dig a complex trench. \n\nIn addition, some trenches are not actually meant for infantry. Some are meant to be traps to get vehicles stuck or to at least get them to expose more vulnerable parts. You can usually tell these apart from infantry trenches as \u201cvehicle trenches\u201d are much wider than their counterpart which would be counterproductive for infantry. You don\u2019t want to make it easier for artillery shells to land in the trench.\n\nEdit 3: Addendum\n\nAs a disclaimer, take these videos with a pinch of salt. Misattribution may be possible.  \n\nIt should be said, that if a zig-zag trench can be built, then it will be built. The trenches in the video below are allegedly built by Russian/separatists forces.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/blue_sauron/status/1522153648628842496?s=46&t=BS9bR7LeU4xRrNGfPtXlow\n\nThey do attempt some zig-zag trenches but some in the video aren\u2019t due to obstacles. In addition, they are extremely rudimentary. \n\nCompare that to the Wagner line or these trenches.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ralee85/status/1526842970921750528?s=46&t=UTrHVmiWjsT9RIhF2ofCFw\nhttps://twitter.com/martinmakh/status/1526951186322149377?s=46&t=UTrHVmiWjsT9RIhF2ofCFw\n\nThe main trench above was constructed in or before 2018 and it displays a couple things that the rudimentary trench system does not. It is less haphazard and possesses firing positions every so often with zig-zag secondary trenches. However, later on the trench had to be redone and the bottom part of the trench system was filled in and replaced with the zig-zag trench arm we see in the video.\n\nThere are other instances of straight trenches that were more due to obstacles than a lack of time.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/geoconfirmed/status/1561130135130087424?s=46&t=UTrHVmiWjsT9RIhF2ofCFw\n\nThe Ukrainian trench across the road is the textbook example of a straight trench. However, it was not due to time constraints. If you look closer at the video, zig-zag trenches are present on the sides of buildings past the straight trench. In this case, the straight trench doubles as a vehicle trench and was built around the buildings. \n\nAs for why zig-zag trenches exist, consider this video.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/force_a_ukraine/status/1582286367299538945?s=46&t=UTrHVmiWjsT9RIhF2ofCFw\n\nThe Ukrainian drone dropped an explosive on a Russian, killing them. However, the guy to his direct right was at least able to crawl away. The zig-zag part of the trench compartmentalized the damage to that section of the trench, saving the other Russian\u2019s life.",

And the last question absolutely jumps the shark. \n\nRussian tank forces are divided first between active and reserve, second between those forces in Ukraine and those on normal duty elsewhere. As losses have mounted tanks have been pulled out of reserve, but also out of active units not in Ukraine to be sent to Ukraine. The US Army has ~5,000 tanks in active service. If we assume Russia has a similar number, it\u2019s pretty clear a substantial (tho maybe not majority) of the vehicles are not in theater but are elsewhere securing borders. So some number of the reserve was surely activated and sent not to Ukraine but to other units who had earlier lost their own higher readiness vehicles. \n\nThen add to it we know corruption ravaged the Russian equipment reserve. Cash meant for facilities and equipment maintenance was stolen or misspent, vehicles were picked over for hardware to be sold to on the black market or back to the contractor so they could put it on new stock. And of course most people managing the reserve didn\u2019t generally give a shit. It was a formula for disaster and some number of Russian tanks that *should* have been available are not, and will never be. \n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely for there to be a hidden reserve. Currently Russia is struggling to produce replacements for combat casualties. They almost certainly don\u2019t have the manpower to generate and sustain an entire second force somewhere else.
