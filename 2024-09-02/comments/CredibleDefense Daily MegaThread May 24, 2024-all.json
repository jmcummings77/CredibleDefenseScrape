        "body": "A few news regarding command roles for the Ukrainian and the Russian side.\n\nBrigadier General Yevhen Ostrianskyi, head of the Defense Planning Department of Ukraine's General Staff, stated that the personnel of the General Staff will be cut by 60%; the redundancies shall be redistributed to combat units and intermediate command and control bodies.\n\nhttps://t. me/GeneralStaffZSU/14875\n\nThis comes after internal audits held by Syrsky during the past few months and is in all likelihood a necessity in response to the most serious manpower shortage affecting the UAF: the lack of officers. The laid-off personnel will go to staff both combat units (primarily, I assume, the new brigades being created) and to strengthen the staff of OSGs (Operational-Strategic Groups) and OTGs (Operational-Tactical Groups). In addition, it's stated that there will be changes in the current command structure, also with the aim of avoiding \u201cduplication\u201d of roles. Let's recall that the current chain of command in Ukraine is: brigade --> OTG --> OSG --> GS. TGs (Tactical Groups) may be between the first and second level and OGs (Operational Groups) between the second and third, but they are rarely used. Moreover, operational commands have their own staffs but don't perform command/operative functions as far as I know, but they have just a formal, support and organizational role (I believe they also oversee the creation of new brigades, their territorial recruiting basins, etc).\n\nDeepState stated that 28 officers are being investigated by the Ukrainian State Bureau of Investigation in response to the failure to defend the borders in the early days of the Russian offensive against Kharkiv Oblast (scarce preparation of fortifications, having ignored the Russian build-up in the grey area near the border). The officers being inquired range from the (former) commander of the OTG \u201cKharkiv\u201d (Brigadier General Halushkin) to company commanders of units that were in that sector in early May, including the commander of the 125th TDF Brigade (which was responsible for the front line between the Kharkiv River and the Siversky Donets), who has since been removed from his post. Commanders of the 415th Separate Rifle Battalion, of a battalion of the 23rd Mechanized Brigade and of the 172nd Territorial Defense Battalion of the 120th TDF Brigade are being inquired too. \n\nhttps://t. me/DeepStateUA/19554\n\nNews from yesterday but wasn't posted, so I do so now. The commander of Russia's 20th Army (Moscow Military District), Major General Sukhrab Akhmedov, has been removed from his post (officially he has resigned). The news was originally reported by Vladimir Rogov, who stated that Akhmedov is now at the disposal of the MoD. It's unclear by whom he will be replaced. \n\nhttps://t. me/milinfolive/122806\n\nNumerous Russian Telegram channels are satisfied with this. As the man until now in charge of the offensive actions against Terny and Yampolivka in the Kreminna sector, he had been heavily criticized over the recent months for his operational choices, which resulted in heavy losses - particularly among units of the 144th Motorized Division - with progress almost absent for nearly 3 months now. Not to mention his role in Vuhledar in late 2022 and early 2023 as the commander of the coastal troops of the Pacific Fleet (he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Muradov - they are even brother-in-laws).\n\nInterestingly, some minor Russian channels mention an incoming change in the leadership of the Group of Forces \"North\". The current commander is Colonel General Lapin (since mid-April, when this GoF was created); he may be replaced by Major General Alexander Kravtsov, i.e. the current commander of the 41st Army (Central Military District). I stress that unlike the previous case these are just rumors and this is not confirmed by more authoritative sources, so in the coming days we will see if that finds development or confirmation. It's stated that Lapin would remain commander of the Leningrad Military District anyway - but I repeat, take this with a grain of salt. \n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1093\n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1101\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/2505\n\nOne of these two sources states that the commander of the operations in Vovchansk is Major General Storozhenko, commander of the 6th Army (Leningrad Military District). He is a native of Kharkiv and in 2014 was the commander, as a colonel, of Ukraine's 36th Coastal Defense Brigade in Crimea. When the Russians seized the latter, he defected to their side, and became the commander of the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade, created on the basis of the disbanded Ukrainian brigade (which was later reconstituted in Mykolaiv as the current 36th Marine Brigade). He later made a career in the Russian Armed Forces, becoming deputy commander of the 35th Army (Eastern Military District) and its acting commander during spring/summer 2022. I believe he became commander of the 6th Army in the beginning of this year, when according to some Russian rumors, the leadership of the 6th Army and of its brigades was removed following the costly failures around Synkivka, in the Kupyansk sector.\n\nThis month there was also a reshuffle in the command of some military districts, according to what I have found from Russian official sources.\n\nColonel General Kuzovlev became commander of the new Moscow Military District (unclear if, as a result, commander of the GoF \"West\" too). Before Russian sources disclosed that, it was anticipated by the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets in mid April. Kuzovlev was until now the commander of the Southern Military District, where he was replaced by Colonel General Anashkin (the current commander of the GoF \"South\" is not known). As written above, Lapin has been the commander of the Leningrad Military District since its creation in late February. Colonel General Mordvichev, titled of the seizing of Avdiivka, was confirmed as commander of the Central Military District as well as the GoF \"Centre\". Lieutenant General Alexander Sanchik became the commander of the Eastern Military District, replacing Colonel General Kuzmenko. The current commander of the GoF \"Vostok\" is unknown. In contrast, the commander of the GoF \"Dnepr\" remains Colonel General Teplinsky, who is also the commander of VDV.",

The commander of Russia&#39;s 20th Army (Moscow Military District), Major General Sukhrab Akhmedov, has been removed from his post (officially he has resigned). The news was originally reported by Vladimir Rogov, who stated that Akhmedov is now at the disposal of the MoD. It&#39;s unclear by whom he will be replaced. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/milinfolive/122806</p>\n\n<p>Numerous Russian Telegram channels are satisfied with this. As the man until now in charge of the offensive actions against Terny and Yampolivka in the Kreminna sector, he had been heavily criticized over the recent months for his operational choices, which resulted in heavy losses - particularly among units of the 144th Motorized Division - with progress almost absent for nearly 3 months now. Not to mention his role in Vuhledar in late 2022 and early 2023 as the commander of the coastal troops of the Pacific Fleet (he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Muradov - they are even brother-in-laws).</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, some minor Russian channels mention an incoming change in the leadership of the Group of Forces &quot;North&quot;. The current commander is Colonel General Lapin (since mid-April, when this GoF was created); he may be replaced by Major General Alexander Kravtsov, i.e. the current commander of the 41st Army (Central Military District). I stress that unlike the previous case these are just rumors and this is not confirmed by more authoritative sources, so in the coming days we will see if that finds development or confirmation. It&#39;s stated that Lapin would remain commander of the Leningrad Military District anyway - but I repeat, take this with a grain of salt. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/severnnyi/1093</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/severnnyi/1101</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/2505</p>\n\n<p>One of these two sources states that the commander of the operations in Vovchansk is Major General Storozhenko, commander of the 6th Army (Leningrad Military District). He is a native of Kharkiv and in 2014 was the commander, as a colonel, of Ukraine&#39;s 36th Coastal Defense Brigade in Crimea. When the Russians seized the latter, he defected to their side, and became the commander of the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade, created on the basis of the disbanded Ukrainian brigade (which was later reconstituted in Mykolaiv as the current 36th Marine Brigade). He later made a career in the Russian Armed Forces, becoming deputy commander of the 35th Army (Eastern Military District) and its acting commander during spring/summer 2022. I believe he became commander of the 6th Army in the beginning of this year, when according to some Russian rumors, the leadership of the 6th Army and of its brigades was removed following the costly failures around Synkivka, in the Kupyansk sector.</p>\n\n<p>This month there was also a reshuffle in the command of some military districts, according to what I have found from Russian official sources.</p>\n\n<p>Colonel General Kuzovlev became commander of the new Moscow Military District (unclear if, as a result, commander of the GoF &quot;West&quot; too). Before Russian sources disclosed that, it was anticipated by the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets in mid April. Kuzovlev was until now the commander of the Southern Military District, where he was replaced by Colonel General Anashkin (the current commander of the GoF &quot;South&quot; is not known). As written above, Lapin has been the commander of the Leningrad Military District since its creation in late February. Colonel General Mordvichev, titled of the seizing of Avdiivka, was confirmed as commander of the Central Military District as well as the GoF &quot;Centre&quot;. Lieutenant General Alexander Sanchik became the commander of the Eastern Military District, replacing Colonel General Kuzmenko. The current commander of the GoF &quot;Vostok&quot; is unknown. In contrast, the commander of the GoF &quot;Dnepr&quot; remains Colonel General Teplinsky, who is also the commander of VDV.</p>\n</div>",

The real trick is the scale up but first steps need to be taken and they have been.\n\n[First Replicator drones already in Indo-Pacific, DOD says | Defense One | May 2024](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/05/first-replicator-drones-already-indo-pacific-dod-says/396863/)\n\n*The Pentagon\u2019s flagship program to quickly produce large numbers of low-cost, highly autonomous drones is \u201cproducing real results,\u201d Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said in a statement Thursday, noting that \u201cthe delivery of Replicator systems to the warfighter began earlier this month.\u201d*\n\n*The aim of the Replicator program, announced in August 2023, is to deliver tens of thousands of low-cost land, air, and sea drones to operators in the Pacific by the end of 2025. Each of the services are expected to play a role in testing, acquiring, and deploying them. The hope, in part, is that the rapid fielding of wide numbers of networked drones could help deter Chinese aggression in the Pacific prior to 2027, when many anticipate China could make a military move to annex Taiwan. The program could also enable the department to move toward new, much more rapid acquisition models.*\n\n*The Pentagon would not specify which drones exactly have already reached INDOPACOM, and has been cagey in general in discussing the program. In May, it announced it had selected AeroVironment\u2019s (AV) Switchblade 600 for the program, a system that INDOPACOM already has in some number. But \u201cthe first tranche of Replicator also includes certain capabilities that remain classified, including others in the maritime domain and some in the counter-UAS portfolio,\u201d the Pentagon said earlier this month.*\n\n*The Pentagon plans to spend about half a billion dollars on the effort this fiscal year, and there\u2019s another half billion or so in the 2025 budget request.

In other cases, **such as aircraft-dropped bombs called JDAMs, the manufacturer provided a patch and Ukraine continues to use them.**\n\n> HIMARS were celebrated during the first year of Russia\u2019s invasion for their success in striking ammunition depots and command points behind enemy lines.\n\n> But by the second year, \u201ceverything ended: the Russians deployed electronic warfare, disabled satellite signals, and HIMARS became completely ineffective,\u201d a second senior Ukrainian military official said. \u201cThis ineffectiveness led to the point where a very expensive shell was used\u201d increasingly to strike lower-priority targets.\n\n\n> Kyiv still considers its HIMARS rockets effective, but Russian jamming can cause them to miss a target by 50 feet or more.\n\n> \u201cWhen it\u2019s, for example, a pontoon bridge \u2026 but there\u2019s a 10-meter deviation, it ends up in the water,\u201d the first Ukrainian official said.\n\n> Russian jamming signals are sent up from the ground and form a cone-shaped area. Any guided munition \u2014 or aircraft \u2014 passing through is at risk of interference.\n\n> The official added, \u201cThe Americans are equipping HIMARS with additional equipment to ensure good geolocation.\u201d\n\n\nbut most interestingly:\n\n\n> **One U.S. weapon used by aircraft, the GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, has proved resilient to jamming, according to the confidential documents. Nearly 90 percent of dropped bombs struck their target, the assessment found.**\n\n> Its smaller surface area makes it more difficult for Russian systems to detect and intercept, the documents said. Ukraine first received the aerial weapons, which has not been previously disclosed by the Pentagon, in November 2023.\n\n> The GBU-39 was also adapted for land use in HIMARS systems, a development that Pentagon officials said would increase the range of rocket artillery. But the modified weapons, known as Ground-Launched Small Diameter bombs, or GLSDB, proved ineffective compared to those launched from airplanes, Ukrainian officials said. The ground versions were tested in Ukraine, one official said, and the Americans are working on adjustments before providing them anew.\n\n> William LaPlante, the Pentagon\u2019s acquisition chief, said last month that an adapted weapon \u201cdidn\u2019t work for multiple reasons,\u201d including jamming and other tactical and logistical issues. LaPlante did not disclose which weapon he was referring to, but other experts said that he was describing the GLSDB.\n\n\nSo GLSDB's issues were a factor of ballistic missiles/artillery in general or the integration of SDB to the rocket being vulnerable to loss of GPS guidance. HIMARS is jammed, but the deviation is small enough and warhead big enough to mean it's still effective. Aircraft dropped bombs, probably due to their shorter flight time and maybe due to their smoother flight, are less affected, with the more modern SDB performing better than JDAM, and JDAM improved after software changes. Excalibur was the worst, I'm guessing due to tradeoffs that have to be made in such a compact device exaggerated by the unforgiving small warhead. It might also be because of the frontline jamming meaning the shell can never even get an initial fix. \n\nThere's a reason there's flight testing, risk reduction, and all of that with military hardware. I think part of the issues of air launched munitions might also be that they aren't able to be handed off the location fix from the aircraft as they would on a Western fighter due to the ad-hoc mounting system used.",

If the drone can't get up and stay up it becomes a lot less useful.\n\nI haven't quoted the whole article below.  I recommend clicking for the concept art if nothing else.  \n\n[DARPA\u2019s Naval VTOL X-Plane Drone Program Narrows Down To Two Designs | The Warzone | May 2024](https://www.twz.com/news-features/darpas-naval-vtol-x-plane-drone-program-narrows-down-to-two-designs)\n\n*So far, we know that Northrop Grumman and Sikorsky have been down-selected for Phase 1b of ANCILLARY, with potentially other companies involved as well. In addition to these two firms, Phase 1a of the program also involved AeroVironment, AVX Aircraft, Griffon Aerospace, Karem Aircraft, Leidos, Method Aeronautics, and Piasecki Aircraft.*\n\n*Phase 1b will include air vehicle design and system technology maturation. Over a period of 10 months, the chosen contractors will \u201cincrease modeling fidelity, perform critical subsystems testing, and reduce key technical risks,\u201d according to Northrop Grumman. This will bring the program a step closer to the construction of a flight demonstrator, for which flight tests are planned to begin in early 2026.*\n\n*Northrop Grumman will head up a collaborative team, also including Leigh Aerosystems and Near Earth Autonomy on its ANCILLARY offering. The Northrop Grumman ANCILLARY design has a straight wing, with pods at each tip that support a horizontal rotor for VTOL flight. A pusher propeller is fitted at the rear of the fuselage, which also supports an inverted V-tail. This is a fairly common configuration of VTOL drones in use around the globe today.\n\n*Northrop Grumman describes its design as \u201ca cost-efficient, multiple-mission capable vehicle built on an agile platform that will not rely on complex launch and recovery infrastructure. It meets DARPA\u2019s challenging performance objectives, weighs no more than 330 pounds, and can be deployed and retrieved anytime or anywhere with no special infrastructure, including ship-based operations.\u201d*\n\n*Reportedly, Northrop Grumman\u2019s ANCILLARY demonstrator will be capable of carrying a 60-pound sensor payload, offer more than 20 hours\u2019 time on station, and have a mission radius range of 100 nautical miles. As well as ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore logistical missions, the Northrop Grumman design will be expected to undertake critical intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting missions, for which it will employ artificial intelligence and machine-learning-enabled automated targeting capability.*\n\n*While Northrop Grumman\u2019s ANCILLARY is designed to take off and land much like a familiar quadcopter-type drone, the rival from Sikorsky is a VTOL tail-sitter design. This includes a long straight wing with twin proprotors. The drone sits on its tail, supported by its twin tailfins, taking off and landing like a helicopter before transitioning to horizontal forward flight for long-endurance missions. Sikorsky announced yesterday that it\u2019s already conducting flight tests \u201cto mature the control laws and aerodynamics of a novel vertical takeoff and landing uncrewed aerial system,\u201d a reference to the \u2018rotor blown wing\u2019 configuration.*\n\n*\u201cFlight tests are underway to verify our tail-sitting rotor blown wing UAS can launch and land vertically with high stability, and cruise efficiently on wing,\u201d said Igor Cherepinsky, director of the rapid prototyping group Sikorsky Innovations. \u201cKey enablers to flight maneuverability, and future vehicle scalability, are our MATRIX autonomy flight control system, and an articulated rotor system similar to those in traditional helicopters.\u201d*\n\n*The initial Sikorsky flight tests involve a battery-powered proof-of-concept vehicle. The manufacturer plans to follow this with a 300-pound hybrid-electric version that will include a 60-pound intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) payload.*",

It appears that the standoff weapon is now better established in Russian service, which will pose additional problems for the hard-pressed Ukrainian air defense operators.*\n\n*The new imagery of the UMPB D-30SN winged precision-guided bomb includes photos showing two examples under the wing of a Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) Su-34 Fullback strike aircraft. While the Su-34 is a notably big aircraft, the relatively diminutive size of the bomb is very obvious.*\n\n*When mounted on the aircraft, the off-white-painted UMPB D-30SN has its cruciform tailfins deployed, but the main wing is folded to lie flush with the bomb\u2019s streamlined body. While the wing is mounted on the top of the weapon, the bomb itself is attached inverted to the aircraft. Like earlier Russian glide bombs, the weapon topples over after launch, ensuring that it\u2019s the right way up.*\n\n*The overall appearance is of a weapon that is much more refined than the previous UMPK, a fairly crude type of weapon that nonetheless has caused considerable difficulties for Ukrainian air defenses since its introduction in around early 2023. As we postulated when the new weapon first appeared:*\n\n*\u201cWhile the UMPK consists of a wing kit and precision guidance package that\u2019s essentially bolted onto one of several different freefall bombs, the UMPB appears to have a slicker, far more elegantly integrated design.\u201d Back then, we also noted that the new weapon appeared to be something of an analog to the U.S.-made GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb and, on a superficial level at least, this also appears to hold true.*\n\n*What is not apparent in the new imagery of the UMPB D-30SN is any sign of a powerplant, which would provide a significant improvement in range. In the past, there had been rumors that the weapon might have a powerplant, specifically a small turbojet engine mounted below the body. While this remains a possibility, as an option, there is no evidence of a propulsion system at this stage.*\n\n*Other rumors when the winged precision-guided bomb first appeared suggested that it might be a dual-use weapon, intended not only for launch from aircraft but also from ground-based rocket artillery. Again, there is no evidence so far of that being the case. However, the concept is certainly feasible.*\n\n*Unconfirmed reports suggest that the UMPB D-30SN uses both inertial and satellite navigation. However, the exact guidance method used is unknown, so it\u2019s unclear if the weapon can be programmed with a target\u2019s coordinates after the aircraft has taken off, which would be required for the most time-sensitive targets.*\n\n*Also important, an inertial navigation system should provide the weapon with a significant degree of resistance to electronic warfare jamming of the kind that is now increasingly being employed by Ukraine. Still, without GPS data to correct for drift, INS has accuracy limitations that get more pronounced the longer the weapon travels.*\n\n*The addition of the UMPB D-30SN to the Russian armory will be a concern for Ukraine, especially as it awaits new Western-supplied air defense systems.

Clearly, neither Russia or the US cared that much!**\n\nhttps://x.com/ItsArtoir/status/1794056625457603023\n\n\nhttps://x.com/krakek1/status/1793954582327918632\n\nUkraine struck a Russian ballistic missile Early Warning radar in Armavir, Russia with some sort of long range strike yesterday. It didn't cover much of any of Russia, especially the area north that is used by Ukraine's normal OW-UAS strikes, and while it did technically have the angle to see into Crimea, it only would be able to see targets above 20km at that range due to the radar horizon. A wikipedia search says ATACMS flies up to 50km, so it might have provided warning for that, but it would be very short notice and they might not have integrated it.\n\n You can't rule it out providing early warning though, and I figure this is why Ukraine targeted it.

Clearly, neither Russia or the US cared that much!</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/ItsArtoir/status/1794056625457603023\">https://x.com/ItsArtoir/status/1794056625457603023</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/krakek1/status/1793954582327918632\">https://x.com/krakek1/status/1793954582327918632</a></p>\n\n<p>Ukraine struck a Russian ballistic missile Early Warning radar in Armavir, Russia with some sort of long range strike yesterday. It didn&#39;t cover much of any of Russia, especially the area north that is used by Ukraine&#39;s normal OW-UAS strikes, and while it did technically have the angle to see into Crimea, it only would be able to see targets above 20km at that range due to the radar horizon. A wikipedia search says ATACMS flies up to 50km, so it might have provided warning for that, but it would be very short notice and they might not have integrated it.</p>\n\n<p>You can&#39;t rule it out providing early warning though, and I figure this is why Ukraine targeted it. Even a 5 minute warning can save lives and prevent a lethal strike on commanders, and this radar and system would have been built to give a very rapid warning of any incoming missiles and their target points in a nuclear strike. </p>\n\n<p>It is still a crucial part of Russia&#39;s early warning nuclear C3, and it would be interesting to see if this harms the push for Ukraine&#39;s use of western weapons in Russia.

Russia could lose all of its conventional armed forces tomorrow but still be in a position (due to their Strategic nuclear forces and infrastructure) to maintain their existence (as they see it). Losing nuclear forces represents an immediate existential threat that has different connotations and responses to the gradual loss of conventional equipment and infrastructure.\n\n>These are difficult-to-replace strategic Russian assets. By destroying them, Ukraine is raising the price of war for Russia, thus nudging them to reconsider continuation of conflict. Ending Ukraine conflict soon should be in the interest of US.\n\nOn paper this is correct, in reality it's not. It's not a simple binary decision for Russia to make, there are far too many variables to summarize their continuation of the conflict purely on a cost basis, Russia have already demonstrated that non favourable loss ratios and significant economic and material damage does not factor in to their continuation of the war (or as much as we would like it to). You could continue ramping that cost up through energy infrastructure strikes, further sanctions, more aggressive material losses in the war but so far this has not worked and there is a major difference between the cost/reward of targeting conventional and energy infrastructure versus Nuclear C3 infrastructure. One can be replaced albeit with great cost and may slow Russian aims in the war or reverse the course entirely using financial levers, the other can be viewed as the pretext of an existential strike against Russia itself, these are two *\\*very\\** different scenarios and we should be careful not to view strikes against NC3 infrastructure and assets as merely costly strikes in the context of a conventional war.\n\nAs far as asset cost, the radars themselves are not that expensive (approximately $50/100M, maybe more if they are going to rush them, they've been slowly replacing the older Soviet systems for a while now). The real cost (and associated risk) is now having a Russian flank completely exposed to both long range conventional and more importantly nuclear strikes. The cost for Russia isn't financial but rather the lack of capability that has now developed, and this lack of capability will factor in to political determinations and perhaps even crisis level interpretations, *this is why you don't strike NC3.*\n\n>Also, a weaker Russia is less likely to cause problems elsewhere later, and would be more compliant to US/NATO posture. That should also be in the interest of US.\n\nDegrading Russian nuclear forces is far more likely to cause problems elsewhere later. Take into consideration a hypothetical, if US C3 infrastructure and early detection systems were all systematically destroyed, would the US respond to potential existential and military threats more cautiously or with more suspicion and potential non-matched aggressive reactions?\n\nA conventionally weaker Russia is less likely to cause problems elsewhere later, that is true, but I'm not sure that is going to be the case unless things significantly turn around and Russian military production infrastructure is harassed and destroyed, they will be exiting this war with significantly improved production capacity in nearly all fields, stronger ISR and battlefield experience as well as a greatly inflated military budget. On paper Russia might be weaker as far as napkin math reserve tank totals went pre-war, but their conventional forces will be far more adept and integrated at prosecuting a war than the haphazard disaster they were going into things in 2022.\n\nAs far as being compliant with US/NATO posture, that's just never going to happen. Russia views themselves as a great power, whether they are or not is nearly entirely irrelevant, it's how their decision making process both at home and abroad functions and the last 20 years have demonstrated clearly that US/NATO/EU influence and strategic moves have failed to make Russia \"compliant\". You can't make someone compliant whose entire being and domestic imagery relies on the portrayal of themselves as a super power that is under threat from those around them. The harder you try and force compliance, the stronger Russia will amplify its domestic messaging and political manoeuvring in response.\n\n>What's the reasoning? Just to avoid upsetting status quo?\n\nNuclear status quo has been the cornerstone of the last 70 years of \\*relatively\\* peaceful, albeit cold, terse and downright hostile, co-existence. Upsetting MAD is a bad idea, it's why ESSI and other initiatives are major points of tension for the Russians, they believe that a rebalancing of the nuclear status quo outside of their favour would be the preparation for an existential strike. Destroying NC3 infrastructure at a time when Russia feels under threat from a large part of the nuclear world and nearly every conventionally armed country in NATO/EU could trigger a chain of decisions that have extremely poor outcomes.\n\nWhen there's a near infinite list of other targets within range in Russia, targeting the primarily nuclear early warning radar is one of the last options I would consider, especially when you're making the case to the US that you supposedly have the responsibility necessary to use American weapons on Russian targets inside Russia itself.",

What has really changed this war is commercial satellite constellations. There are a large number of low and mid resolution commercial satellites that fly over the region many times a day now so not only the Ukrainian state but OSINT accounts can buy and analyse satellite imagery. \n\nSo while US space based imagery will be being used the large constellations of the likes of PlanetLabs and Maxar may actually be more useful and are very clearly being used. \n\nThe \"most likely\" technique would be to use the commercial grade stuff to monitor for a target, then get the high res KH-11 to do a check to ensure you are getting what you think before assigning an asset to target it. There are six up so judging by their orbits you may get two passes a day. Since they have a very very narrow image range and are over and gone very quickly, you would assume their targets are often selected days in advance.",

There are a large number of low and mid resolution commercial satellites that fly over the region many times a day now so not only the Ukrainian state but OSINT accounts can buy and analyse satellite imagery. </p>\n\n<p>So while US space based imagery will be being used the large constellations of the likes of PlanetLabs and Maxar may actually be more useful and are very clearly being used. </p>\n\n<p>The &quot;most likely&quot; technique would be to use the commercial grade stuff to monitor for a target, then get the high res KH-11 to do a check to ensure you are getting what you think before assigning an asset to target it. There are six up so judging by their orbits you may get two passes a day. Since they have a very very narrow image range and are over and gone very quickly, you would assume their targets are often selected days in advance.</p>\n</div>",
