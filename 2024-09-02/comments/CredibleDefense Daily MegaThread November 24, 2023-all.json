And also this feeling that nobody really cared.

Having failed to achieve a decisive victory in the war, said Alexander Gabuev, an expert on Moscow-Beijing relations at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, Russia \u201cfaces [the] risk that Ukraine will try to disrupt the Kerch bridge for many years to come.\u201d  \n> \n> The project would also pose political and financial risks for China, which has never officially recognized Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and whose companies could become ensnared in economic sanctions that the United States and the European Union have imposed on Moscow.\n> \n> Nevertheless, intercepted emails indicate that one of China\u2019s largest construction companies has signaled its willingness to participate. The messages were provided to The Washington Post by Ukrainian officials hoping to expose the project and China\u2019s potential involvement. The authenticity of the messages was corroborated by other information separately obtained by The Post, including corporate registration files showing that a Russian-Chinese consortium involving individuals named in the emails was recently formed in Crimea.\n> \n> Emails circulated among consortium officials in recent weeks mention meetings with Chinese delegates in Crimea. One dated Oct. 4 describes the Chinese Railway Construction Corporation, CRCC, as \u201cready to ensure the construction of railway and road construction projects of any complexity in the Crimean region.\u201d\n> \n> CRCC, a state-owned company, built many of the largest road and rail networks in China and has established substantial ties to Russia in recent years through projects including an extension of the Moscow subway system that was completed in 2021. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n> \n> A senior executive at the Russian-Chinese Consortium, based in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, refused to answer questions about the tunnel project when reached by a Post reporter.\n> \n> Vladimir Kalyuzhny, a Russian businessman who is identified in documents as the general director of the consortium, dismissed the matter as \u201ca lot of hot air\u201d before declaring that he would not provide any information to the \u201cenemy media\u201d and abruptly ending the call.\n> \n> His response was at odds with how the proposal has been depicted in internal emails. In a message sent last month to a Russian official who serves as one of Crimea\u2019s main representatives in Moscow, Kalyuzhny said he had \u201ca letter from our Chinese partners about the readiness of one of the largest companies in China, CRCC, to participate as a general contractor in the construction of a tunnel under the Kerch Strait.\u201d\n> \n> The email was addressed to Georgiy Muradov, who is listed as the permanent representative of the Republic of Crimea to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Muradov, who previously served as Russia\u2019s ambassador to Cyprus, did not respond to requests for comment.  \n> \n> Ukraine has declared the recovery of Crimea as one of its principal war objectives, and is in the midst of a faltering counteroffensive that was aimed at cutting off Russia\u2019s logistics lines to the peninsula.\n> \n> The tunnel proposal comes as Russia is pushing ahead with other infrastructure projects in territories it has occupied since 2014 or seized since last year\u2019s invasion. Recent satellite images have shown new sections of rail along the Sea of Azov coastline, part of an occupied land route that also connects Russia to Crimea.\n> \n> The construction involves companies associated with Arkady Rotenberg, a childhood friend of Putin\u2019s who amassed enormous wealth through Kremlin-backed projects including the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The 71-year-old oligarch has acquired extensive property holdings in Crimea since its illegal annexation, when he was first placed under sanction by the U.S. Treasury Department, security officials said. His construction company, Stroygazmontazh, also served as the lead contractor on the Kerch bridge.\n> \n> The consortium\u2019s registration files show that six of the organization\u2019s nine founding directors are not named in the public filings, which is allowed under Russian laws designed to protect targets of Western sanctions.\n> \n> The emails also reveal Chinese efforts to maintain secrecy. One emphasizes that CRCC will participate only under a \u201cstrict provision of complete confidentiality\u201d and that the company\u2019s name will be replaced by \u201canother, unaffiliated legal entity\u201d on any contracts. Another email mentions a Chinese bank willing to \u201cconvert its dollar funds into rubles for their transfer to Crimea to fund [consortium] projects.\u201d\n> \n> The emails cite consortium discussions with a CRCC executive identified as Xu Huaxiang, a name that appears to match that of a Chinese national who is listed as a vice president and deputy general manager of the international arm of the company. Attempts to reach Huaxiang were not successful.\n> \n> Given the risks of sanctions and sabotage, U.S. officials and experts expressed surprise that CRCC would risk involvement.  \n> \n> \u201cIt would be odd that either a consortium of major PRC firms or the government would support such a project,\u201d said a U.S. official involved in sanctions policy, referring to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cThe project would seem like a pretty easy target for Ukrainians to destroy.\u201d The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject.\n> \n> Experts on major international transportation projects said that constructing a tunnel beneath the Kerch Strait is technically feasible and that China has the necessary expertise and equipment. Still, they said, it would be a huge undertaking, comparable in scale to a tunnel between Denmark and Germany that has been under construction for eight years, is projected to cost more than $8.7 billion, and would be the longest tunnel in Europe when it is completed near the end of the decade.\n> \n> Experts said that it is unlikely that a Kerch tunnel could be completed in time to aid Russia in its war effort, but that Moscow may see it as a longer-term investment \u2014 one meant to provide a secure link to territory that could be contested for decades. The project\u2019s backers appear to be worried about the economic atrophy that could take place without safe passage.\n> \n> For Putin, Crimea has symbolic significance that makes it \u201cimportant to connect it to Mother Russia,\u201d said Maria Shagina, an expert on Russia and Western sanctions at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Over the past nine years, Russia has made Crimea dependent on water, power and communications lines tethered to Russia. A tunnel, Shagina said, would be \u201ca physical extension of the narrative\u201d Putin espouses.\n> \n> For its part, China would probably insist on at least partial ownership of the tunnel, adding to its expanding inventory of global port and transportation infrastructure, experts said. China could also finance the project and extract payment either in tolls or from Russian oil and gas exports.\n> \n> Subterranean work could proceed at minimal risk, engineering experts said, but the project would still put thousands of employees, costly pieces of equipment and sprawling construction sites within reach of Ukrainian missiles.\n> \n> Because of the threat of attack, experts said, Russia and China would probably not be able to use newer construction methods involving giant dredging vessels on the water\u2019s surface. Instead, they would have little choice but to use traditional tunnel-boring technology.\n> \n> \u201cThat would be very difficult to sabotage unless you attack the entrances,\u201d said an engineer who has worked on several of the world\u2019s largest tunnel projects. Building a tunnel across the Kerch Strait would likely cost at least $5 billion and require Russia\u2019s military to protect \u201cnot only the strait but the production sites you need\u201d on shore, he said. \u201cIt is a high-risk operation.\u201d",

As we've seen with previous attacks in their missile campaign, Russia very quickly starts shooting at low value targets, like Ukrainian power transformers. A giant wave of 400 missiles will either hit a small group of targets an unreasonable amount of times, or Russia will have to scrape the barrel even deeper for things to shoot them at.

After that, Mao began to conserve his forces for a short while, before returning to the offensive in late 1947, giving his troops time to rest, re-train, and replenish their ranks by recruiting from defectors, prisoners, defeated bandits in the north, and the local population. It also allowed them to gradually transition from guerrilla to conventional operations, from mobile operations by foot-mobile light infantry, to positional assaults involving artillery, armor, engineering elements, etc.",

It is altogether improper to defend cities to the utmost, for this merely leads to sacrificing our own effective strength.&quot; - Mao</p>\n\n<p>Instead of giving the KMT the opportunities to force positional battles against his troops in 1946 (since the NRA at the time, was superior in numbers, weapons, supplies, and training) Mao allowed his commanders to retreat north, from the cities, across the Songhua River, leaving only two columns (two corps) to perform delaying actions south of the river, in South Manchuria. After that, Mao began to conserve his forces for a short while, before returning to the offensive in late 1947, giving his troops time to rest, re-train, and replenish their ranks by recruiting from defectors, prisoners, defeated bandits in the north, and the local population. It also allowed them to gradually transition from guerrilla to conventional operations, from mobile operations by foot-mobile light infantry, to positional assaults involving artillery, armor, engineering elements, etc.</p>\n</div>",

The UA govt has been trying to reform its recruitment campaigns to remove blatant corruption (bribes to avoid service) and incompetence (literally \"pressing\" men right in the streets and getting filmed doing it).

Because they deliberately limited the pool, and because they&#39;d previously already inducted so many especially those who were motivated to serve, what&#39;s left is either not eligible for the UA draft or they don&#39;t want to serve, becoming draft dodgers. The UA govt has been trying to reform its recruitment campaigns to remove blatant corruption (bribes to avoid service) and incompetence (literally &quot;pressing&quot; men right in the streets and getting filmed doing it). But they are also trying to avoid expanding the pool by removing more age, occupation, and schooling requirements.</p>\n\n<p>They just revamped the college exception. Turns out tens of thousands of middle aged men suddenly signed up for college classes right when the war broke out, including many who already had degrees now trying to get a second degree.</p>\n\n<p>Many within Ukraine, including in the Rada and the UAF top brass, want Zelensky to authorize a lowering of the current mobilization age, which is 25. So far he&#39;s not wanted to do it. Additionally, while law says women can be drafted, they haven&#39;t been either.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine was [firing up to 6000 shells](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/17/europe/ukraine-shell-supplies-intl/index.html) per day during the counteroffensive, and wanted to go as high as 10k, but wasn't able to. I have no idea what the daily numbers are now.\n\n> So either Ukraine still has substantial parts of their big ROK/US artillery offensive stockpile leftover...\n\n> Or the UA political strategic leadership screwed up and blew through most of their offensive stockpile...\n\nThere might also be a third option. The sources I've cited mention only a few tens of thousands of shells transferred to Israel, but numerous sources also give support to shell deliveries to Ukraine having been reduced considerably. This might be explained by US hesitancy to send material which would have been needed if the Middle East situation had really flared up.\n\nAlso, there is a [large US stockpile in Israel](https://www.jns.org/u-s-israel/u-s-israel-relations/23/6/27/298198/), and this stockpile has been the source of many shipments to Ukraine. It would make sense that in the middle of the Gaza war US wouldn't move ammo from this stockpile to Ukraine. Such a choice would show up as the reported shortage of ammo in Ukraine, but also wouldn't show up as deliveries to Israel, since the ammo is already in Israel.\n\n> Since before WW2, do you think the US, British, Germans, etc are just too stupid to add more artillery to their tactical level forces?\n\nThe US had millions of shells in stock and artillery is still a central, although not the most important part of US doctrine. The European armies have been so downscaled it's hard to say what they would actually be capable of.\n\nIn any case, the West has favored air power over artillery, and I think this may be something of a risk. While the Post-Soviet anti-air systems might not be that accurate, they have been more than good enough to massively reduce the utility of air power in Ukraine. Extreme long-range AA missiles [like the R-37](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/12/23/russias-best-missile-can-hit-ukrainian-jets-from-80-miles-away-but-ukrainian-pilots-know-how-to-dodge/?sh=56f4fa167efc) have been effective in denying Ukraine air power.\n\nI do fear that over-reliance on air power could become a risk against a peer-level adversary with good enough air defence. In any case, I'm getting sidetracked from the actual question here.\n\n> And then before that, to their defense of the Donbas Salient over last spring and summer, where they forbid a maneuver defense despite running out of their own ammo, relying on a list minute injection of NATO artillery pieces, ammo, and other weapon systems to survive.\n\nWhen has the war in Ukraine been anything but a series of last minute injections? A last minute injection of Javelins to stop the initial attack, a last minute injection of HiMARS to bring some parity in artillery, a last minute injection of armor for the counteroffensive, and only a month after the counter offensive had failed a last minute injection of DPICM, and only a month after that a last minute injection of ATACMS...\n\nAlways a drip-drip of support enough to hold the line but not to resolve the conflict, always conditional on Ukraine first throwing its conscript soldiers into the meat grinder to demonstrate their commitment to sacrifice before they get the next batch of support.\n\n> The big difference is this incident with Israel stealing Ukraine's ammo is apparently the first time the Ukrainian risky strategic screw ups didn't result in getting bailed out by the West. But it's still early, let's wait and see.\n\nIn any case, it now looks like the war in Gaza will be a decisive victory for Israel. Hamas has failed to put up a fight, Hezbollah and Iran have been intimidated not to intervene, and if the hostage exchange works and the ceasefire holds it looks like this war might be over in a matter of weeks. Which is a tremendous relief, this was really not the time for another Middle East conflict.\n\nMoving forward, Russia openly supporting Hamas could make Israel more sympathetic to Ukraine. And once the Middle East regional situation has been secured, the US is hopefully able to again move munitions more efficiently to Ukraine too, if that indeed has been the issue now.\n\nSo, in conclusion I would guess that the shortage of shells sent to Ukraine can result from factors other than the direct shipment of shells from US to Israel. I don't have any way to verify this, but putting together all the sources, including the seeming importance of the Israel stockpile for supplying Ukraine, this could be a possible explanation.",

A last minute injection of Javelins to stop the initial attack, a last minute injection of HiMARS to bring some parity in artillery, a last minute injection of armor for the counteroffensive, and only a month after the counter offensive had failed a last minute injection of DPICM, and only a month after that a last minute injection of ATACMS...</p>\n\n<p>Always a drip-drip of support enough to hold the line but not to resolve the conflict, always conditional on Ukraine first throwing its conscript soldiers into the meat grinder to demonstrate their commitment to sacrifice before they get the next batch of support.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The big difference is this incident with Israel stealing Ukraine&#39;s ammo is apparently the first time the Ukrainian risky strategic screw ups didn&#39;t result in getting bailed out by the West. But it&#39;s still early, let&#39;s wait and see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In any case, it now looks like the war in Gaza will be a decisive victory for Israel. Hamas has failed to put up a fight, Hezbollah and Iran have been intimidated not to intervene, and if the hostage exchange works and the ceasefire holds it looks like this war might be over in a matter of weeks. Which is a tremendous relief, this was really not the time for another Middle East conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, Russia openly supporting Hamas could make Israel more sympathetic to Ukraine. And once the Middle East regional situation has been secured, the US is hopefully able to again move munitions more efficiently to Ukraine too, if that indeed has been the issue now.</p>\n\n<p>So, in conclusion I would guess that the shortage of shells sent to Ukraine can result from factors other than the direct shipment of shells from US to Israel. I don&#39;t have any way to verify this, but putting together all the sources, including the seeming importance of the Israel stockpile for supplying Ukraine, this could be a possible explanation.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "What does the community think of this analysis from r/geopolitics of the current Gaza war?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/1832svu/a\\_sober\\_assessment\\_of\\_israels\\_gaza\\_campaign/](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/1832svu/a_sober_assessment_of_israels_gaza_campaign/)\n\nMuch discussion of the ongoing Israel-Hamas War, at least here on Reddit, has devolved into little more than partisan cheer-leading. As someone with actual \"skin in the game\" however I think it might be worth taking a sober, realistic, and skeptical look at events so far from an Israeli perspective.\n\nFollowing the Gaza Division's comprehensive defeat on October 7th and the killing or capture of hundreds of IDF personnel and civilians during Hamas's \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", the Israeli army managed to recover relatively quickly and drive enemy forces back across the pre-war line of demarcation. PM Benjamin Netanyahu concurrently announced the start of a combined air-and-ground campaign - \"Operation Iron Swords\" - with three stated goals in order of strategic importance:\n\n1) The complete annihilation of Hamas.\n\n2) The unconditional release of all Israeli hostages (military and civilian).\n\n3) The \"flattening\" of Gaza City into a \"city of ruin\".\n\nNearly 50 days later we can say that this operation has so far failed to achieve its first goal. Despite high-explosive destruction akin to three Fat Boy's, and a four-division combined-arms assault on its supposed headquarters, Hamas remains organizationally cohesive in both North and South Gaza as evidenced by its continued (if diminished) ability to launch massive rocket attacks from the refugee \"camps\" of Gaza City into Tel Aviv and by its ability to enforce the terms of the current truce on its own members and other Gazan militias. The IDF's elite armored units have managed to penetrate deeply into parts of the city, capturing a number of nominally important landmarks, but these units have to this point been either unable or unwilling to enter Hamas's strongholds in Shejaiya and Jabalya. Furthermore, the army's actual degree of control in occupied sectors is unclear, as video from Hamas and PIJ sources show-off numerous hit-and-run attacks behind enemy lines. Whether these attacks have actually been effective in attritioning Israeli forces is another matter (there is conflicting evidence here), but it does indicate that in the context of this extremely asymmetrical guerilla conflict captured territory is not necessarily controlled territory. The destruction of numerous tunnel entrances has not definitively resolved this issue.\n\nIn regards to its second goal, the IDF has proven similarly unsuccessful - freeing one captive in a putative spec-op rescue and finding three more unfortunately dead, out of almost 250 total. The initial ground invasion was almost entirely planned around the capture of three major hospitals in the north, with an armored thrust down the coast to Rantisi Hospital, a simultaneous push across and then up from the south towards Al-Shifa Hospital, and a subsequent piercing movement bypassing Beit Hanoun to the Indonesian Hospital. This plan ostensibly promised the rapid return of hostages from Hamas command and control facilities beneath these medical centers, but the IDF's plodding and controversial siege tactics (surrounding Al-Shifa and Rantisi complexes for a week before taking them uncontested) have meant that - even if Hamas had maintained some operational presence within these facilities - they and the hostages are long gone. Furthermore, these tactics have resulted in an unmitigated PR disaster, prompting skepticism towards Israeli actions from even its closest allies in the Biden administration. Though these public \"disagreements\" are mostly just media spectacle, eventually friendly political actors in the West will have burnt through so much political capital that they can no longer oppose a lasting ceasefire (which is akin to Israel's defeat).\n\nThe failure of the IDF's tactical approach has culminated in this current hostage release deal (which Netanyahu insisted for over a month would never happen), almost entirely on the Hamas leadership's repeatedly stated terms and in line with their openly stated strategic objectives. And the reason that the Israeli state was forced to cave under immense internal and external pressure is in part its remarkable success towards accomplishing goal 3: the destruction of Gaza City. Outside of the uncaptured refugee \"camps\" in its geographic center, almost the entirety of North Gaza has been fully or partially destroyed. The IDF thus managed to partly achieve the Netanyahu government's initial objective of creating a humanitarian crisis, thereby forcing the area's civilian population south in order to annex all territory north of Wadi Gaza as either a buffer or resettlement zone (though his cabinet is still publicly divided on this, and it faces severe opposition from both Egypt and Jordan). However there likely remain as per recent video evidence from the Shejaiya and Jabalya districts tens or hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza City. Blockade tactics have proven ineffective at driving them through the IDF's filtration points on Salah al-Din road, and resupply during the ongoing truce - as stipulated by Hamas demand - will allow them to stay longer.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has been on the literal and proverbial clock from the minute it began dropping 1-ton explosives on apartment buildings packed with women and children in full view of the entire world through social media. Whether the ensuing campaign has been discriminate or indiscriminate, whether the deaths have been in the thousands or the tens of thousands (as both IDF and Hamas sources have claimed), and whether the systematic dismantling of healthcare and education facilities in Gaza City is a war crime or a necessity, Israel is nonetheless running out of time. The two US Carrier Strike groups off its coasts, maintained at the cost of billions in American taxpayer money, will not remain forever. The escalatory attacks from Hezbollah to the north, the Houthis to the south, and Iran's Iraqi proxies to the east may eventually result in a disastrous multi-front conflict. Furthermore, the plight of Israeli hostages and of Palestinian civilians in both Gaza and the West Bank is increasingly limiting Israel's opportunity to act with a relatively free hand. Hence Hamas's ability to now dictate negotiations on its own terms, giving lie to the IDF's conceit that it will be able to continue this slow, grinding, brutal ground campaign for 3-6 months as its planners insist.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Operation Iron Swords\" has been almost completely unsuccessful in every regard except one: the creation of the aforementioned humanitarian disaster, especially in North Gaza. This makes sense, as the IDF's \"long siege\" tactical approach is perfectly tailored to inciting human misery but horribly ill-suited to hostage rescue or asymmetric conflict against guerillas in tunnels. Therefore, in approving this operation, the Netanyahu government has almost certainly caused many more problems than it has solved since that terrible day of October 7th. The chest-thumping delusions of pro-Israeli Western observers (the Hebrew-language discourse is much more measured when it comes to military matters specifically) need to be shattered and alternative approaches put forward. The most obvious being an actual, permanent negotiated settlement in which Israel and Hamas recognize each other as legitimate governing entities. This has already been partially accomplished, as today's truce proves that both sides despite repeated statements to the contrary regard their opponent as a sovereign actor. Thus it simply becomes a matter of political pressure exerted by either internal or external forces, who unfortunately have largely decided that aiding and abetting the Netanyahu regime's disastrous course is the more practical option. The evidence so far seems to disagree.",

Hamas has been  cut off, they aren't getting any reenforcement, and they have so far failed to inflict the significant casualties people where predicting (as someone else said here a while ago, people where acting like Hamas was Azov battalion). Israel is under no significant time constraint, they could slowly grind through Gaza for months, and in the end, they would have troops and ammo to spare. Rushing to meet arbitrary deadlines, and taking more casualties, does not play to their advantage.\n\nThe post also grossly mischaracterizes the hostage deal. Around 150 Palestinians for 50 Israelis is almost nothing by Hamas standards, and a four day cease fire, that Israel will use to rotate in fresh troops, while Hamas sits under siege in Gaza city, will not play much to their favor. The likely reason this deal happened was because those hostages were in the cut off areas, and unless Hamas traded them soon, their positions would be overrun and they would get nothing in exchange for them.\n\nThe risks of a broader regional conflict has also decreased with time. Other forces, like Hezbollah, were most dangerous, and most likely to attack immediately after the 7th. As Israel mobilized troops, the chances they would do anything significant dropped, along with the effectiveness of any attack even if they did try.\n\nI'm all for sober analysis, but this is just grasping at straws. Hamas was not hoping to trade each of these hostages for just three or four people, when in the past they got hundreds per Israeli hostage. They were hoping to bleed the IDF dry with IEDs and RPGs in urban fighting, it's not looking like that's going to happen either.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s bad, very bad.</p>\n\n<p>Israel is far more reluctant to take casualties than to take more time. Hamas has been  cut off, they aren&#39;t getting any reenforcement, and they have so far failed to inflict the significant casualties people where predicting (as someone else said here a while ago, people where acting like Hamas was Azov battalion). Israel is under no significant time constraint, they could slowly grind through Gaza for months, and in the end, they would have troops and ammo to spare. Rushing to meet arbitrary deadlines, and taking more casualties, does not play to their advantage.</p>\n\n<p>The post also grossly mischaracterizes the hostage deal. Around 150 Palestinians for 50 Israelis is almost nothing by Hamas standards, and a four day cease fire, that Israel will use to rotate in fresh troops, while Hamas sits under siege in Gaza city, will not play much to their favor. The likely reason this deal happened was because those hostages were in the cut off areas, and unless Hamas traded them soon, their positions would be overrun and they would get nothing in exchange for them.</p>\n\n<p>The risks of a broader regional conflict has also decreased with time. Other forces, like Hezbollah, were most dangerous, and most likely to attack immediately after the 7th. As Israel mobilized troops, the chances they would do anything significant dropped, along with the effectiveness of any attack even if they did try.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m all for sober analysis, but this is just grasping at straws. Hamas was not hoping to trade each of these hostages for just three or four people, when in the past they got hundreds per Israeli hostage. They were hoping to bleed the IDF dry with IEDs and RPGs in urban fighting, it&#39;s not looking like that&#39;s going to happen either. They were hoping to derail Israel&#39;s normalization negotiations with Saudi Arabia, also not looking like it&#39;s going to happen. And they wanted allied forced, like Hezbollah and Iran to pile on in a larger war against Israel, that&#39;s also didn&#39;t happen.</p>\n</div>",
