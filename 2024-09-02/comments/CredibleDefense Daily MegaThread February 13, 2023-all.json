Mainly fought in recon roles in the Kharkiv region. Do consider the caveats that come from this perspective (frontline and wilderness parts probably more accurate, overall tactics/strategy probably less so, everything is anecdotal)\n\n- Russians seem to be particularly afraid of fighting in the woods (Finnish and Vietnamese readers will crack a smug smile), instead opting to hold settlements and lay large quantities of artillery mines to cover the edges of the forests. He mentions especially the small butterfly mines, which (I did not know this) apparently do have a 48 hour timer on them but are still laid frequently enough to be present at all times.\n\n- \"HIMARS probably saved my life\". The strikes on Russian ammo depots made a night-and-day difference in the volume of frontline fires within 30 days, particularly in mortars and lighter artillery. He recounts an example where Russian mortars almost bracketed his team with an observation drone hovering on them, but appeared to run of shells before they could manage a hit.\n\n- He has a low impression of Russian discipline, having seen unkempt trenches from observation drones. His team had captured two AK-12s that didn't look like they had ever been cleaned, and a badly maintained BMP.\n\n- Friction between old and new generations of Ukrainian officers, he has a low opinion on the former (who, I realize now, have likely been brought out of retirement to lead some of the newly formed brigades, hence the larger number of anecdotes of these recently)\n\n- Anger at the lack of VA support for veterans returning from Ukraine, would like more extensive training by Green Berets.

How do you attack another countries troops directly without it being a defacto declaration of war? Could Russia destroy the 7th fleet while minimizing US casualties and it not be war? The US and its citizens would call for blood. Any military power would and should consider such a blatant attack on their forces war. Come on now...\n\n2. Russia has already admitted it cannot beat NATO in a conventional war.

Since mid-November, his unit has been working in the Bakhmut area, north of Bakhmut.\n\nInteresting tidbits about Bakhmut:\n\n* according to him, there is a rough parity of one-to-one between his unit's artillery and that of the Russians in the vicinity of Bakhmut,\n* Russians avoid using heavy equipment in the area of Bakhmut as it is a prime target for artillery strikes,\n* Ukraine's artillery can't really afford to fire at a group of fewer than 10 RU soldiers,\n* Wagner is countering Ukrainian artillery by being extremely dispersed into small groups of 3 soldiers each, they dig in and then use leap-frog tactics, taking turns advancing and providing cover fire for each other.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit - Ukraine was so successful in hunting Russian tanks/armored vehicles that Russia no longer deploys armored vehicles on the front line, they are hidden in the back.

Since mid-November, his unit has been working in the Bakhmut area, north of Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting tidbits about Bakhmut:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>according to him, there is a rough parity of one-to-one between his unit&#39;s artillery and that of the Russians in the vicinity of Bakhmut,</li>\n<li>Russians avoid using heavy equipment in the area of Bakhmut as it is a prime target for artillery strikes,</li>\n<li>Ukraine&#39;s artillery can&#39;t really afford to fire at a group of fewer than 10 RU soldiers,</li>\n<li>Wagner is countering Ukrainian artillery by being extremely dispersed into small groups of 3 soldiers each, they dig in and then use leap-frog tactics, taking turns advancing and providing cover fire for each other.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another interesting tidbit - Ukraine was so successful in hunting Russian tanks/armored vehicles that Russia no longer deploys armored vehicles on the front line, they are hidden in the back. It&#39;s become difficult to hunt Russian armor because of that.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>My conclusion - it would be nice to have DPICM 155mm shells or DPICM mortars as a means of countering the dispersed tactics of Wagner.</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "Take this colonel. He's a professional officer who ended up the commander of a reserve artillery brigade before the war, with nearly everyone in his brigade joining up afters and only given two weeks to ready themselves before being committed to battle. Even if they sucked, would be admit that to Ukraine media? That's the point of these stories, their propaganda press releases by people who are supposed to know how to talk to the media and knowing to say and more importantly, what not to say. Was he  going to throw his brigade under the bus to Ukraine media, Ukraine people including the families of his troops, and the world at large, and say they could be better? \n\nBut as a former USMC and Army NCO myself with a lot of background in modern military history, I know full well the emphasis on training, it's history, how it works to know that 2-5 weeks buys mediocre at best. That can only really mean an extremely limited lesson plan, everyone taught only their role with minimal breadth of knowledge, and not at all well drilled. \n\nThat would likely be okay with a system who uses commissioned officers especially to micromanage the \"NCOs\" and junior enlisted in terms of technical knowledge, which characterizes the Soviet Union, and Russians are still like that too.

Transferring ATACMS to the battlefield in eastern Europe would dwindle America\u2019s stockpiles and harm the U.S. military\u2019s readiness for a future fight, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons the military is hesitant to send the ATACMS is due to a desire to maintain a certain level of munitions in U.S. stockpiles</p>\n\n<p>Lockheed Martin has produced about 4,000 ATACMS in various configurations over the past two decades. Some of those missiles have been sold to allied nations, which bought the missile for their own multiple rocket launcher systems.

I get jumping into the polar jet and crossing the Pacific. But the Middle East is a different set of air currents in the upper atmosphere.\n\nQuick primer. Atmosphere has 3 giant cells per hemisphere. These are highly idealised and only loosely present but it explains much about why we have rain forests, deserts trade winds etc\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\\_circulation#/media/File:Earth\\_Global\\_Circulation\\_-\\_en.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation#/media/File:Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg)\n\nThe two jet streams form between the cells, the Polar and Ferrel (called mid latitude in the diagram) cells, and the Ferrel and Hadley cells (where my user name comes from) The first is the polar jet stream and the second is the sub tropical. From where on in things get very complex because weather..... and climate are complex.\n\nBut the polar jet stream runs acrosss the Atlantic and Pacific waving but fast. You can pop a balloon into that in the west and it scoots east at a couple of hundred miles an hour. Japan bombed the US doing this and its a big part of your air travels at those latitudes.\n\nPerhaps they can pop it in around Hainan Island or something and get it all the way round the world on the subtropical jet? Or maybe they release them form boats?\n\nStill this does seem quite the revelation, though I think people might not realise this is a bit more sophisticated than just popping a balloon into the polar jet and letting the Earths rotation do its thing.\n\nHope the science makes sense. Also may explain I have been absolutely adamant this was deliberate from the start. Drop a balloon into the northern polar jet and you can pretty much predict where its going using online tools.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/13/u-s-denies-operating-surveillance-balloons-over-china-00082524\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/13/u-s-denies-operating-surveillance-balloons-over-china-00082524</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>he U.S. military has observed a number of high-altitude Chinese surveillance balloons flying over the Middle East and Afghanistan in recent years, a top general said Monday.The news is the latest disclosure about what U.S. officials are calling China\u2019s \u201cfleet\u201d of surveillance balloons that have recently <strong>flown over the U.S. and 40 countries</strong> \u2014 including one the U.S. military shot down this month off the East Coast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>....</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt is China that has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program for intelligence collection, that it has used to violate the sovereignty of the US and over 40 countries across 5 continents,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a tweet on Monday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.....</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby on Monday also emphatically denied that the U.S. is flying balloons over China\u2019s airspace, saying Beijing\u2019s claim is \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d The Chinese spy balloon program, however, is <strong>something the Biden administration has \u201cbeen studying since we came into office\u201d</strong> and \u201ccommunicated to dozens of other countries about,\u201d Kirby said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do you get a balloon to the Middle East from China? I get jumping into the polar jet and crossing the Pacific. But the Middle East is a different set of air currents in the upper atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Quick primer. Atmosphere has 3 giant cells per hemisphere. These are highly idealised and only loosely present but it explains much about why we have rain forests, deserts trade winds etc</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation#/media/File:Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation#/media/File:Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg</a></p>\n\n<p>The two jet streams form between the cells, the Polar and Ferrel (called mid latitude in the diagram) cells, and the Ferrel and Hadley cells (where my user name comes from) The first is the polar jet stream and the second is the sub tropical. From where on in things get very complex because weather..... and climate are complex.</p>\n\n<p>But the polar jet stream runs acrosss the Atlantic and Pacific waving but fast. You can pop a balloon into that in the west and it scoots east at a couple of hundred miles an hour. Japan bombed the US doing this and its a big part of your air travels at those latitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps they can pop it in around Hainan Island or something and get it all the way round the world on the subtropical jet? Or maybe they release them form boats?</p>\n\n<p>Still this does seem quite the revelation, though I think people might not realise this is a bit more sophisticated than just popping a balloon into the polar jet and letting the Earths rotation do its thing.</p>\n\n<p>Hope the science makes sense. Also may explain I have been absolutely adamant this was deliberate from the start. Drop a balloon into the northern polar jet and you can pretty much predict where its going using online tools. Its really obvious.</p>\n\n<p>The politics here with multiple countries being spied on makes this an interesting step up.</p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t see Kirby dropping any bombshells. like the Huron balloon was just air trash. Canada likely will get to the Yukon one and that might be more likely to be a spy balloon. God knows how they will get the Alaska one. We shall see.</p>\n</div>",

[The text](https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/1172021-37533) just says Ukraine is determined to regain control of its territory by using diplomatic, social, economic, legal/judicial, etc. as well as military means, but makes it quite clear that this isn't the priority (it's, in fact, hardly mentioned at all, and only in the most vague of terms); there's even a \"priority for deoccupation\" section, where the first points are about the necessity of democratic and economical development to get closer to EU living standards in UA as a way of making a return to Ukraine more attractive, which kind of indicates a rather long term goal.\n\nTalking about military means doesn't necessarily just mean invasion either (although it doesn't exclude it either, of course), one of the ways Russia was trying to legitimize its control over Crimea was via forcing Ukrainian ships to ask for permission to enter the Sea of Azov via the Black Sea, which Ukraine was contesting of course (see Kerch 2018 incident) - there is a military/security side to the question which goes beyond military invasion/liberation.\n\nAnd for Crimea in particular, it says modalities for de-occupation are to be set via international negotiations, which seems to preclude sending the army:\n\n>Peculiarities of the state policy on ensuring the de-occupation of the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol\n\n>92. Ukraine initiates an international negotiation process regarding the determination of modalities for the liberation of the temporarily occupied territory and the restoration of the constitutional order of Ukraine in this territory, based, in particular, on the provisions of the Memorandum on Security Guarantees in Connection with Ukraine's Accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as well as on the results of the activities of the Crimean Platform.\n\n>93. Ukraine guarantees and ensures the protection of the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of citizens of Ukraine, foreigners and stateless persons who will legally stay on the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol after deoccupation.\n\n>94. Ukraine will ensure the holding of elections on the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol in accordance with the standards of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the legislation of Ukraine after the liberation and full restoration of the constitutional order of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territory, the full and final reintegration of the Crimean peninsula into the political and legal , cultural and information field of Ukraine.\n\n>95. The procedure for returning the temporarily occupied territory to the general jurisdiction of Ukraine will take place in accordance with the Constitution and laws of Ukraine.\n\nEDIT : Oops, sorry, yes I agree with your message about \"lack of steps\". I got lost reading the document and came back to my comment with the impression you thought this indicated an invasion/validated the 140K claim, but I just re-read your comment.

Where did I say it is an action of principle? NOWHERE. So stop being like the Soviet/Fascists/call your authoriter dictatorship whatever you like and don't tell me what I think.\n\nThe Western response is an action of strategy, bleeding a potential enemy out, showing the rest of the world that the order that they hold up is still strong and the US/NATO dominance is unchallenged, even without them joining in to the fight. And doing this all on the cheap. Breaking russia after it failed to democratize and slinked back to a dictatorship (and you can argue it isn't, but lets not kid ourselves, they murder and imprison their non controlled opposition and change their laws as they see fit). It is a threat that reacted to its neighbor decision to try to join to the West instead of his sphere of power with the natural resources it had. It reacted with war and the West reacted not to protect Ukraine, but to teach russia a lesson about the democratic world order and its signed and accepted international agreements. Does this mean that the defense of democratic principles has no place in it? (There I said principle) No, it is part of it, a small, not really important, part that helps selling it to their domestic audiences, does it make it false? No, it is true and that is why it is working.\n\nYou don't see the difference between genocide? You think that countries support is based on moral principles not in geopolitical realities and cold logic? Don't make me laugh ... The condemnation of russia is widespread enough, the support isn't because of said geopolitical realities. Most countries (as in numbers) has nothing to do with the russo-Ukraine war, that is true and that is why there isn't a more widespread support. Because countries that do not follow logical conclusions and act on them no longer exists, plain and simple.\n\nThis is classic WhatAboutism, missing the difference between shoving someone and beating him to death with a hammer ... And then trying to bring completely out of context issues to a discussion. What right does anyone has to do right after it did something bad? Every right ... no matter what you did, it does not mean you cannot act justly from now on. Otherwise, humanity is lost after the first murder.\n\nSo the US had a speech on neo-colonialism, again you are trying desperately to change the subject that a country is mass murdering, stealing children's by the thousands, raping and looting. Because that is what you don't want to see,  because that is what is missing from the last few decades of western military interventions/wars, because you cannot understand that being on the position of strength doesn't necessarily means that you are always wrong.\n\nYes, the West has a string of actions that I am against, I was against the 2. Iraq war, I am against what happened with the east Timor oil fields, I am against a whole lot of things from the UK/France intervention in Egypt to the ignoring of the civil war in Yemen. That doesn't mean that when they are acting on the moral high ground I do not accept it (unlike you, who refuse on the basis that they haven't always acted morally, you are the one bringing morality into something that never had any and then accuse me of it...).\n\nThat doesn't mean that there there isn't at least a chance for the culprits to be judged (Again, I said this before, the system is faaaar away from perfect, but much better then what russia and China is trying to build and at least has a chance to improve, unlike the other two. Trust me, I have more then enough first hand experience of those kind of systems, but I know that you have never lived under a real authoritarian regime), do they get away most of the time? Yes. Do they get away every time in a dictatorship, also yes.\n\nEven humans can do good and bad things, countries are much more complex.\n\nYour dream of black and white just simple does not align to reality, because there is very little in this world that is black and white. They are just different shades of gray. You have showed, multiple times by now, to be unable to differentiate between those shades, or unable to comprehend the march of time and judge events in the past from the stand points of the past.\n\nThis is my last response on this as I don't want to dignify what will follow with further responses neither any of this is defense related. I just won't stand for being told what I believe in and how wrong I am by someone who showed himself to be like you and who obviously doesn't know what I believe or think.\n\nEdit - Oh yeah, sovereignty is more then territorial integrity, but it is part of it. russia doesn't just attack of Ukraine territories, it denies its existence, but keep up the lies if you already started. Your reasoning is the same as if a car breaks down and you say, no, it just the engine. Thank you for your insight ...",
