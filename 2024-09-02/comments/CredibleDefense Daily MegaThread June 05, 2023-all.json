However, I do have some old school mates who got jobs on the other side of the power plant fence, and despite their irrational fear of electricity and intellectual shortcomings (how else would you get a job *there*?) we stayed friends. If anyone's interested in the idle speculation of three and a half engineers here it goes:\n\n* There is probably no imminent danger to the ZNPP, so at least there's that. The ZNPP is further up the river at quite some distance, the Dniepr is a large river flowing through a plain, and as far as we know, water installations were usually designed to withstand destruction of any water installations also built on the same waterway. \n* Most of the videos show barely any hints of burning or explosion marks. However, it is quite possible that any scorch marks and the like would be on debris that has already been carried away, as any parts with significant scorch marks are also likely to be structurally damaged and thus break away quite easily.\n* Some of the videos seem to show two ruptures, but without knowing when they were taken, it's not immediately clear if that means there were two ruptures. However, two ruptures so close together, with one of them so much larger, would be pretty unlikely to be due to \"natural\" causes alone.\n* The dam is old and maintenance likely suffered lately, but other than that it has always been well maintained, even in the pretty tumultuous nineties. Memes about Soviet equipment notwithstanding, dams built in that period are in fact quite solid. It's quite unlikely that it would rupture after just a year and a half of poor maintenance, or even no maintenance at all. Lack of inspection and maintenance work may have prevented timely response to a developing problem but as far as it's publicly known, it was actually performed. We know that from public statements by Ukrhydroenergo, which has limited access to the installation, and by the same authorities that claimed to have destroyed all the HIMARS in the world though.\n* It's not at all clear why the reservoir was kept full for so long. There's no plausible explanation in terms of power generation demands or regular power plant operation, but there are other installations downstream, too (e.g. for irrigation) that I know shit about. However, a full reservoir would a) reduce the amount of explosives needed to induce a rupture (there's more weight on the dam, so you need to make less of a crack to cause it to break, and you can crack it further up, where the dam is thinner) b) increase the amount of initial overwash, so it would carry more of the debris and compromised elements downstream and, of course, c) increase the amount of water flowing downstream and the strength of the initial flooding. If you want maximum plausible deniability and flooding effect, a full reservoir is what you want.\n* As far as legislation goes, since the hydroelectric plant was on the Russian-occupied side, maintenance of the dam and the plant was technically the responsibility of the Russian authorities. International legislation would've required them to allow unrestrained access for maintenance or to do it themselves. If the dam was not blown up, and was destroyed due to structural damage from lack of maintenance or shelling, responsibility to prevent it and/or mitigate its consequences (including, if necessary, by keeping it at the lowest possible water level, both to reduce strain and to reduce the effects of flooding) rests firmly with the Russian administration.",

The biggest question I dont know is what standard the Aus -18s are up to, as with the ex-/post-Soviet stuff electronics are even more important for performance than other hardware. \n\nOffensively both aircraft mount nearly the same suite of weapons. US -18s may have access to more weapons, since it has the USN stuff on top of the more common NATO gear. But in terms of capabilities, nearly identical in both A2G & A2A. Even legacy Hornets should have -120C missiles and the latest sidewinders. The radar differences Im not sure about, but the -16 Block 52s *should* have an edge in power, and thus range. In terms of HARM I believe the -16 HARM pod should give it an edge. I also think the data cart features are more robust and integrated with the -16. That is its easier to get data off the -16 than the older -18s. The Navy doesnt do HARM like the USAF does, HARM and anti shipping tend to go hand in hand. Balanced against this, the Hornet can carry more ordinance and has a higher overall wing load. This means that, IIRC, the hornet can bring up 2x the number of HARMs or like 6 more -120s. Thats huge. I think this generally gives the F-18 am edge in BVR as it can stay in a fight longer.\n\nIn terms of maneuverability and close in fighting the F-16 weighs less with only a single engine and a much lighter frame. It also holds energy really well. Its very dangerous in a fight as a result. But the -18 is fast in a straight line and has much better low energy characteristics. That creates an interesting matchup sort of like between the BF-109 and Spitfire. Both are very good at what they do, both are do very different things. \n\nThe biggest advantage for the F-18 is its short field capability, HOWEVER, IIRC without an arresting gear or steam catapult its short field qualities arnt actually all that better. Importantly tho, the F-18 has a TON of thrust. Its also got a heavier airframe so it can get on the ground faster and slow quicker. There was a good video on IG i saw a few weeks ago of -16 amd -18 landings. The USAF guys went slow, touched one wheel down at a time, and went very gently. Took a ton of room, but was easy on the frame. The USN guys, even without an arresting gear, slammed two wheels down, and had the third down within a hundred feet. Shorter, but harder on the frame. \n\nJokes aside, in DCS I prefer the -18 but get the sense the two are well matched. DCS isnt real life, but on paper both versions modeled in the game would be close to what Ukraine *may* get. What really is going to make the difference is the electronic package that each plane will have. Probably the F-16s are going to have more modern upgrades, and can be upgraded to a higher standard. Either will do better than what Ukraine has, but will struggle against the MIG-31, Su-35, and Su-57.",

Maybe truth is something in between, but not enough real information to worry about it one way or another.</p>\n</div>",

All of the parts, which are needed to ensure the missiles can perform at night and in low light, were manufactured by the KBM, which exported the same type of parts to India in February 2013.\n\n>Russia may have reimported the parts for repairs, but there were no records of the items being sent back to India as of the end of March this year.

But according to Kinichi Nishimura, a military analyst who previously served at Japan&#39;s Ministry of Defense, &quot;Any defective products should have been replaced when discovered in a full inspection conducted at the time of import.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The Russian NPK KBM, the Russian initials for the Machine-Building Design Bureau, which is tasked with missile production, purchased a total of six components for night-vision sight for ground-to-air missiles for $150,000 from the Indian Ministry of Defense in August and November 2022. All of the parts, which are needed to ensure the missiles can perform at night and in low light, were manufactured by the KBM, which exported the same type of parts to India in February 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Russia may have reimported the parts for repairs, but there were no records of the items being sent back to India as of the end of March this year. Neither the KBM nor the Indian ministry responded to Nikkei&#39;s request for comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Most recently, the US said it would support a joint effort by other nations to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Milley said that Ukraine is prepared for the counteroffensive because the US and partner nations have provided \u201ctraining and ammunition and advice, intelligence.\u201d\n\n>Russia has already begun to claim that it has repelled a \u201clarge scale offensive,\u201d in southern Donetsk, though they have not provided evidence to support the claim.\n\n>The war has also begun creeping into Russia, as suspected Ukrainian drone strikes hit inside Moscow and a shelling attack was carried out in Belgorod. Asked Monday if such attacks would risk escalating the conflict, Milley said there is \u201calways risk\u201d of escalation, and it\u2019s something the US is watching \u201cvery, very carefully.\u201d\n\n>Speaking to CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria last week, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US believes Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive \u201cwill allow Ukraine to take strategically significant territory back from Russia.\u201d\n\n>CNN reported Monday that Ukraine has begun providing drones to a network of agents and sympathizers inside Russia who are working to sabotage Russian efforts.

Most recently, the US said it would support a joint effort by other nations to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Milley said that Ukraine is prepared for the counteroffensive because the US and partner nations have provided \u201ctraining and ammunition and advice, intelligence.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russia has already begun to claim that it has repelled a \u201clarge scale offensive,\u201d in southern Donetsk, though they have not provided evidence to support the claim.</p>\n\n<p>The war has also begun creeping into Russia, as suspected Ukrainian drone strikes hit inside Moscow and a shelling attack was carried out in Belgorod. Asked Monday if such attacks would risk escalating the conflict, Milley said there is \u201calways risk\u201d of escalation, and it\u2019s something the US is watching \u201cvery, very carefully.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria last week, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US believes Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive \u201cwill allow Ukraine to take strategically significant territory back from Russia.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>CNN reported Monday that Ukraine has begun providing drones to a network of agents and sympathizers inside Russia who are working to sabotage Russian efforts. There is no evidence that the recent drone strikes have been carried out by those pro-Ukraine agents, but officials told CNN they had noticed an uptick of attacks inside Russia\u2019s borders.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere has been for months now a pretty consistent push by some in Ukraine to be more aggressive,\u201d one source familiar with US intelligence said. \u201cAnd there has certainly been some willingness at senior levels.

For the first time since the start of the Russian invasion, Ukrainians have been asked to use less electricity, with nationwide limits on usage between 07:00 and 23:00.\n\nIf the Kakhovka dam were destroyed, Mr Zelensky warned it could devastate the water supply to much of the south and leave Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia without cooling water.\n\n\u201cThe dam of this hydroelectric power plant holds a volume of about 18m cubic meters of water,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Russian terrorists blow up this dam, more than 80 settlements, including Kherson, will be in the zone of rapid flooding. Hundreds of thousands of people could be affected.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also said if the dam were destroyed then the North Crimean Canal would \u201csimply disappear\u201d.\n\nThe canal, built in 1975, provides Russian-annexed Crimea with a reported 85% of its water supply. An early act in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February was blowing up a dam that Ukraine had built in the canal after the peninsula was seized in 2014, accusing Russia of not paying for the water.\n\nSeveral Russian commentators have pointed out that areas under occupation would be worst hit if the Kakhovka dam were destroyed, although dozens of communities under Ukrainian control would be badly affected too.\n\nA satellite image shows a view of the location of the Kakhovka dam and the surrounding region in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine, October 18, 2022 This 18 October image shows how much of the surrounding area to the west would be submerged if the dam were destroyed Pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said a dam explosion would prompt a 5m-high wave that would wash away all villages beside the Dnieper river at a rate of 25km/h. Within two hours it said the water would hit Kherson city and flood vast areas over three days.\n\nHowever, presidential office adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said that mining the dam was all part of a \u201cSurovikin plan\u201d that involved flooding territory to stop Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive.\n\n**President Zelensky said that if the Russians were seriously considering blowing up the Kakhovka dam, it meant they realised they would not merely lose control of Kherson but the entire south including Crimea.**",

It is not a solution to build new walls and build new barricades. We have to find a way of coexistence which means not getting too dependent on anybody.

Seems rather critical for coordinating a large-scale offensive. \n\n**Excerpt from the NYTimes ([A Ukrainian counteroffensive would face tough terrain and dug-in Russian troops.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/05/world/russia-ukraine-news/a-ukrainian-counteroffensive-would-face-tough-terrain-and-dug-in-russian-troops))**:\n\n\u2018\u2026Russian formations also have gotten increasingly adept at using drones to help pinpoint targets for artillery strikes.

A sufficiently covert network may choose to only communicate from far out in the solar system, with probes going \"radio silent\" whenever they travel further in. \n\n- Signals only need to be as strong as your receiver is sensitive. Modern mobile phone signals are multiple orders of magnitude weaker than old television broadcasts because receivers have gotten so much better, so our tech might not yet be sufficiently sensitive to pick up the weak signals. \n\n- Even if we did somehow pick up a flicker from a nearby star, we might not be able to able to distinguish compressed signal data from random background noise if we're unfamiliar with the encoding algorithm.\n\n> Even if it is early stage grey goo here, it would be late stage grey goo elsewhere in the galaxy.

We've only had the wide-view satellites able to monitor swathes of the sky for around 2 decades, that isn't a lot of time to pick up on a sufficiently slow dimming. \n\nDon't trust me on this as my memory is terrible, but I believe there's been a couple of research projects looking for dimming stars with a few contenders identified, although it's far more likely the result of a drifting dust cloud than it is aliens.",

Modern mobile phone signals are multiple orders of magnitude weaker than old television broadcasts because receivers have gotten so much better, so our tech might not yet be sufficiently sensitive to pick up the weak signals. </p></li>\n<li><p>Even if we did somehow pick up a flicker from a nearby star, we might not be able to able to distinguish compressed signal data from random background noise if we&#39;re unfamiliar with the encoding algorithm.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if it is early stage grey goo here, it would be late stage grey goo elsewhere in the galaxy. We\u2019d observe a sharp dimming in stars as time progresses between stars we observe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes we&#39;d have noticed if stars were disappearing completely, Dyson Sphere style, but how much would we notice a gradual dimming of some stars? We&#39;ve only had the wide-view satellites able to monitor swathes of the sky for around 2 decades, that isn&#39;t a lot of time to pick up on a sufficiently slow dimming. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t trust me on this as my memory is terrible, but I believe there&#39;s been a couple of research projects looking for dimming stars with a few contenders identified, although it&#39;s far more likely the result of a drifting dust cloud than it is aliens.</p>\n</div>",
