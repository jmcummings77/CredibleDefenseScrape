As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

In other words it is likely they think voters will hate Biden if the Ukrainians lose a little, because they won't bother to look into why that is, but if Ukraine lost completely they would probably link that to Republicans holding up aid. So the delay is a balancing act of calculated disfunction, pure politicking.\n\nUltimately, I don't know which is the case, but we can know for sure that Johnson whether from incompetence or bad faith is an extremely ineffective leader. Nobody benefitted from this delay, certainly his party's ostensible priorities like border security were not furthered at all despite that being completely on the table before, and nothing he did at all served to bring about this eventual resolution, it was purely from the outside factors.",

As /u/BeondTheGrave elaborated on above, there are pro's and con's for wheeled vs. tracked and these apply to all vehicles including artillery. However, I think there are a few important points to be made here: \n\n* If you fire unguided rockets, you benefit from getting closer to your target to reduce the spread of impacts. This together with the already relatively limited range of unguided rockets makes a tracked platform desirable because your selection of good firing positions might increase with better off road capabilities.\n\n* I don't think any western country will field unguided MLRS systems in large numbers in the future. Thus if you decide to only fire guided missiles that typically have a (much) larger range and don't really lose any accuracy if you are at the edge of the range, outside of giving your enemy slightly more time to react, a highly mobile platform makes more sense. \n\n* In the past (think cold war) ISR was much worse so it made sense to filed platforms like the M270 or the PZH2000 that were lightly armored, since your enemy, after completing counter battery fire, wouldn't know if they hit anything. Making vehicles that were slightly damaged through shrapnel recoverable. In today's warfare with drones and FPVs your enemy will know what and if they hit reducing the advantage of armor and thus tracked vehicles even more. If your strategy is essentially to get in and out fast and don't get hit, why bring armor?\n\nEDIT: With regards to your argument: \n\n>Road networks there are gravel, and not much else. Those will turn to shit during the 6+ month winter, snow depths of 90cm is the norm.\n\nIn a defensive war impassible terrain is probably to your advantage. We have also seen that tracked vehicles can struggle immensely in mud. I think especially with guided missile systems the range is so large, that you will almost always find a position that you can get to with a wheeled vehicle. Doubling the range of a system increases the possible firing positions massively.",

As <a href=\"/u/BeondTheGrave\">/u/BeondTheGrave</a> elaborated on above, there are pro&#39;s and con&#39;s for wheeled vs. tracked and these apply to all vehicles including artillery. However, I think there are a few important points to be made here: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you fire unguided rockets, you benefit from getting closer to your target to reduce the spread of impacts. This together with the already relatively limited range of unguided rockets makes a tracked platform desirable because your selection of good firing positions might increase with better off road capabilities.</p></li>\n<li><p>I don&#39;t think any western country will field unguided MLRS systems in large numbers in the future. Thus if you decide to only fire guided missiles that typically have a (much) larger range and don&#39;t really lose any accuracy if you are at the edge of the range, outside of giving your enemy slightly more time to react, a highly mobile platform makes more sense. </p></li>\n<li><p>In the past (think cold war) ISR was much worse so it made sense to filed platforms like the M270 or the PZH2000 that were lightly armored, since your enemy, after completing counter battery fire, wouldn&#39;t know if they hit anything. Making vehicles that were slightly damaged through shrapnel recoverable. In today&#39;s warfare with drones and FPVs your enemy will know what and if they hit reducing the advantage of armor and thus tracked vehicles even more. If your strategy is essentially to get in and out fast and don&#39;t get hit, why bring armor?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT: With regards to your argument: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Road networks there are gravel, and not much else. Those will turn to shit during the 6+ month winter, snow depths of 90cm is the norm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a defensive war impassible terrain is probably to your advantage. We have also seen that tracked vehicles can struggle immensely in mud. I think especially with guided missile systems the range is so large, that you will almost always find a position that you can get to with a wheeled vehicle. Doubling the range of a system increases the possible firing positions massively.</p>\n</div>",

This is simply because better fortifications require fewer troops to hold off attacks, they give time to draw up reserves, and thereby they enable greater concentration of troops elsewhere for assaults. Conversely if it is the case that Ukraine has quieter sections of front where they simply station troops but engage in no fortification, then they will be forced to maintain the same levels of troops continuously indefinitely.\n\nThe one wrinkle is the consideration that fortification is an opportunity cost, that you must at the end of the day pay people to dig trenches, pay for concrete, pay for timber pay for machines and the gasoline to fuel them. That is all money that could be used to pay for other things which are necessary. Even if Ukraine simply drafts huge numbers of civilians into trench digging outfits, accepting a lower level of fortification quality than achieved with more materials and machines and just using shovels and axes, those civilians are still taken away from their jobs and holding up the economy which supports the military. So there are limits. \n\nBut it still a worthy question to consider whether Ukraine is even adequately tasking the soldiers held in reserve right now. People in backlines and not actively engaged in fighting could be digging trenches, and there is at least some indications that that isn't really happening right now. If it is the case that Ukrainian leadership doesn't want to convey a defensive posture, a loss of initiative by building fortifications, I think that is a huge mistake though. It is far better to look a little weaker than to actually be weaker, and that is the case wherever troops are forced to fall back to lines that aren't extensively prepared.\n\nWhich is all to say, we are living in the age of the backhoe and the tractor, no matter what Ukraine's strategy should be to put every ounce of available effort into making use of these, because they strengthen offensive and defensive capabilities at the end of the day.",
