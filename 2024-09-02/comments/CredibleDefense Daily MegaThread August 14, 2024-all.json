The latters have to make up for heavier losses, but their current situation is considerably better in terms of staffing levels in their formations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From then onwards we are likely looking at a bare minimum of a few successive batches of about the same quantity every month. Further developments depend on how well the mobilization is progressing, seems like they&#39;ve been keeping the pace relatively stable until now, so I&#39;d assume that the flow will be steady heading, at the very least, into next Spring.</p>\n</div>",

Once they stop gaining ground in the SE, then they consider sending artillery, drones, etc towards Kursk or even another area of the front\n\nThe ground in Kursk is not as important as the Donbas. Chasiv Yar is more important the Suzhda. Last I checked, a couple weeks ago, from start of year to today they were advancing around 0.08 miles per day on average in the Adveevka front. If you just count the last month, however, that has increased to 0.16 miles per day, or roughly double.\n\nRight now Ukraine has moved resources from the SE towards Kursk, so if Russia does not move any resources away from the SE, their force ratio will be even stronger. So that 0.16 miles per day could increase significantly.\n\nWhy would they give up that rate of advance for a risky assault on Kursk? \n\nI know a lot of people are saying because of the political fallout of Ukraine holding Russian territory, and I recognize that is a serious problem for the Putin regime. But we have to recognize that no matter what they do, taking back Kursk will take a lot of resources and time. \n\nWould you rather\n\na) spend a ton of resources in order to take Kursk back? kursk will be in the headlines for potentially months, and all of the heavy losses of an assault will be widely publicized since it'll become the spotlight of the war?\n\nb) freeze the line at Kursk and continue advancing in the SE at a faster rate? kursk will still be a thorn in your side, but the spotlight of the war will continue to be the SE. Kursk will become boring and relatively less attention will be paid to it\n\ni think counter intuitively, freezing and ignoring Kursk is the best move if they want to reduce the political fallout- the perceived weakness and the embarrassment from Ukraine, the holding of Russian territory",

The latter, in turn, relied upon the rapidity with which trains, trucks, and wagons could deliver stocks of ammunition to firing batteries.\n\nIf a similar dynamic governs the fighting in eastern Ukraine, then it would make little sense for the Ukrainians to employ their best reserve formations to \u2018buttress\u2019 counterparts in the path of the \u2018steamroller\u2019. Rather, a wise commander would look for opportunities to employ such forces in places poorly supplied with artillery ammunition, or, better yet, the means to move, quickly and securely, several thousand hundred-pound rounds.\n\nThe vast majority of bombardments conducted by Russian forces in Ukraine have occurred in a place well supplied with railroads. Indeed, the rich rail network of the Donbas may well have been the deciding factor in convincing the Russians to fight a long campaign of attrition in that region. The Russian forces fighting southwest of Kursk, however, will have to make do with whatever can be sent along the two lines that run out of that city to the south.\n\nHowever, I will refrain from speculating about the future course of the Ukrainian incursion into the area southwest of Kursk until I read the geoconfirmed maps of that region.

That raised concerns in Berlin and Washington that supporting Ukraine could become more complicated. Germany is the European Union\u2019s leading contributor of weapons to Ukraine.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Experts have said that divers could have been responsible for planting the explosives on the subsea pipes, and German news reports identified Volodymyr Z. as a professional diver. When the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reached a man who identified himself by that name by telephone, he denied having any involvement with the attacks or knowing about the warrant.\n>\n> ...\n> \n> A person briefed on the matter confirmed that German prosecutors had issued a warrant for a Ukrainian diver believed to be a member of the team that planted explosives on the pipelines. The diver was living in Poland but was able to escape before being apprehended, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n>\n> The S\u00fcddeutsche, along with the Die Zeit newspaper and the German public broadcaster ARD, reported that the German authorities had tracked down the suspect after a speed camera recorded a van with Ukrainian license plates on the northeastern German island of R\u00fcgen on Sept. 8, 2022.\n>\n> One of the passengers in the van was the suspect sought by German prosecutors, according to the German media outlets. The suspect lived in a suburb of Warsaw and worked as an instructor for a diving school in Kyiv, the media outlets reported. \n\nJust to be clear: The person in the warrant is *not* President Zelenskyy.

This is just the kind of effort I see people putting in their posts here on a regular basis, so it's only fair to do so as well.\n\n> What I get from this is that the cost for the Russians to escalate has consistently been too low.\n\nNot the cost, but the *risk*, although, of course, past cost is a factor in the evaluation of risk. Risk and uncertainty are two of the factors that drive restraint.\n\nImagine you're in the Russian Security Council's staff now, and you're asked to do a risk/benefit analysis for a massive infrastructure bombing campaign over the coming winter. You're trying to outline the worst that could happen. Looking at the previous campaigns, what do you see?\n\nNo additional economic pressure on either Russia or its allies (not even its Western allies, like Hungary, where pressure is easily applied). Not even a tightening of the regime of *existing* sanctions, i.e. nobody bats an eye to the delivery of fossil fuel of obscure, but traceable Russian origin through unregistered ships. No ramp-up in the delivery of other means. No additional risk to frozen Russian assets.\n\nIt literally looks like the worst that could happen is that Ukraine might get improved air defenses about two months or so from the start of the campaign. Is there any reason why you'd recommend anything other than do it, just hurry up?\n\n> The problem with that is that your opponent is trying to do the same, making escalation risky for you. The logical consequence is runaway escalation. \n\nI'm going to go back to the \"trying to do the same part\" in a minute but first I want to note that the absence of risk practically *guarantees* runaway escalation, because the other party knows anything up to wherever the red line actually is (if there even is a red line) is up for grabs. So if they think escalation would be beneficial in their pursuit of their goals, and they literally think they have no reason not to do it, they are very likely to do it.\n\nThe even bigger deal about it is that any haggling over what's acceptable and what isn't then happens right around the \"red line\" where the other party is compelled to respond with overwhelming force. So instead of the two parties probing what's acceptable for the other on territory where a misstep results in nothing more than a blistering speech in the UN General Assembly, they're probing on territory where a misstep results in people in uniforms kissing their families goodbye.\n\nThis is one of the most important lessons of the Cold War. One of the main things that kept it cold, especially after the Cuban Missile crisis, was that the two major superpowers were usually engaged way, way below the threshold where anyone would even think of retaliation more severe than throwing a fuss at a cocktail party. There were exceptions but by and large those were isolated events.\n\nAnd one reason why that happened was that, throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, both parties realized that the risk of direct confrontation, even with purely conventional means, even limited in scope, was simply too high to be worth even the maximum theoretical gains. Simply put, both Soviet and NATO military and political leadership were so concerned about the \"but what if?\" that they just stopped realistically considering it. Even in the paranoid, post-Brezhnev era, when some of the Soviet leadership was literally convinced an attack was coming, much of the political and military leadership was still so concerned that they could put a break on anything too dangerous.\n\n> So how do you do that? Do you assume that Putin is rational and will back down at some point? Is there evidence that it actually works like that in the real world?\n\nOkay, two things about semantics first, just so there's no danger of talking past each other because we're working from different theoretical frameworks. Please note that my background tilts towards history, not international relations (nothing wrong with that field *in general* but I have some beefs with some of it).\n\nFirst, escalation is *the real deal*, not the hypothetical. I.e. when Medvedev keys one of his drunk posts about Russia's enormous nuclear arsenal, that's not an escalation, that's just talking. *Using* it, Heaven forbid, would be the actual escalation. \"Escalatory discourse\" or whatever has a nice ring to it but if we paid attention to everyone who promised some part of the world would be devoured by the raging suns of a thousand nuclear bombs we wouldn't have lasted five years in the Cold War.\n\nSecond, \"rational\", as used in most academic theoretical constructs that are being quoted on TV doesn't mean \"he can think straight and he's not certifiably nuts\" or \"will do the rational thing\" as in won't do something outrageous. It means \"will act so as to maximize his gains\".\n\nIs there evidence that Putin is rational in the latter sense? Yes, absolutely. For instance, he not just negotiated assiduously, but even lost some political face through the grain deal in order to have some sanctions against the Russian financial system lifted. In 2013 and 2014, when faced with the loss of political control over the regime in Kyiv, he chose a limited invasion that secured most of Russia's minimal strategic goals in the region (control of Crimea and the Sea of Azov) over far less certain attempts to immediately re-establish full control over the Ukrainian government. Existing evidence suggests that Putin is very rational and, more importantly, very risk averse.\n\nIs there evidence that he's rational in the former sense? There's a measure of speculation in that, sure, but he exhibits none of the signs that would point at the opposite and his public presence is pretty much the same as it was ten or fifteen years ago (adjusting for age and circumstances). His discourse has been getting more unhinged but it's still very far from Cold War levels of unhinged. Hell, it's still very far from early '90s Russia levels of unhinged.\n\nIs there evidence that risk and uncertainty convinces rational leaders to back down from things \"in the real world\"? Yes, that, too, in fact most of the history of how the Cold War didn't go nuclear, and much of the history of deconfliction during and after proxy wars and of the decolonization is mostly about rational parties deciding, among other things, that the risk of pursuing a particular course of action was too high.\n\nIt's obviously not a one-sided thing. Risk is not the only driver of restraint. A policy based on nothing but maximizing risk for one's opponent isn't even worth speculating about because it's a purely theoretical construct. Real world is a lot more complex than just risk and benefits, and the perception of risk is a lot more complex than just tit and tat.\n\nSo I'm not saying the Cold War remained cold *only* because of risk. But I am saying that, without the considerable, recognized component of risk, on both sides, the Cold War would have been far more likely to escalate. And, *mutatis mutandis*, that as long as the Russian political leadership is not confronted with significant risk, the risk of escalation (both in Ukraine and beyond) is, in fact, very high.",

There were exceptions but by and large those were isolated events.</p>\n\n<p>And one reason why that happened was that, throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, both parties realized that the risk of direct confrontation, even with purely conventional means, even limited in scope, was simply too high to be worth even the maximum theoretical gains. Simply put, both Soviet and NATO military and political leadership were so concerned about the &quot;but what if?&quot; that they just stopped realistically considering it. Even in the paranoid, post-Brezhnev era, when some of the Soviet leadership was literally convinced an attack was coming, much of the political and military leadership was still so concerned that they could put a break on anything too dangerous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So how do you do that? Do you assume that Putin is rational and will back down at some point? Is there evidence that it actually works like that in the real world?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Okay, two things about semantics first, just so there&#39;s no danger of talking past each other because we&#39;re working from different theoretical frameworks. Please note that my background tilts towards history, not international relations (nothing wrong with that field <em>in general</em> but I have some beefs with some of it).</p>\n\n<p>First, escalation is <em>the real deal</em>, not the hypothetical. I.e. when Medvedev keys one of his drunk posts about Russia&#39;s enormous nuclear arsenal, that&#39;s not an escalation, that&#39;s just talking. <em>Using</em> it, Heaven forbid, would be the actual escalation. &quot;Escalatory discourse&quot; or whatever has a nice ring to it but if we paid attention to everyone who promised some part of the world would be devoured by the raging suns of a thousand nuclear bombs we wouldn&#39;t have lasted five years in the Cold War.</p>\n\n<p>Second, &quot;rational&quot;, as used in most academic theoretical constructs that are being quoted on TV doesn&#39;t mean &quot;he can think straight and he&#39;s not certifiably nuts&quot; or &quot;will do the rational thing&quot; as in won&#39;t do something outrageous. It means &quot;will act so as to maximize his gains&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Is there evidence that Putin is rational in the latter sense? Yes, absolutely. For instance, he not just negotiated assiduously, but even lost some political face through the grain deal in order to have some sanctions against the Russian financial system lifted. In 2013 and 2014, when faced with the loss of political control over the regime in Kyiv, he chose a limited invasion that secured most of Russia&#39;s minimal strategic goals in the region (control of Crimea and the Sea of Azov) over far less certain attempts to immediately re-establish full control over the Ukrainian government. Existing evidence suggests that Putin is very rational and, more importantly, very risk averse.</p>\n\n<p>Is there evidence that he&#39;s rational in the former sense? There&#39;s a measure of speculation in that, sure, but he exhibits none of the signs that would point at the opposite and his public presence is pretty much the same as it was ten or fifteen years ago (adjusting for age and circumstances). His discourse has been getting more unhinged but it&#39;s still very far from Cold War levels of unhinged. Hell, it&#39;s still very far from early &#39;90s Russia levels of unhinged.</p>\n\n<p>Is there evidence that risk and uncertainty convinces rational leaders to back down from things &quot;in the real world&quot;? Yes, that, too, in fact most of the history of how the Cold War didn&#39;t go nuclear, and much of the history of deconfliction during and after proxy wars and of the decolonization is mostly about rational parties deciding, among other things, that the risk of pursuing a particular course of action was too high.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s obviously not a one-sided thing. Risk is not the only driver of restraint. A policy based on nothing but maximizing risk for one&#39;s opponent isn&#39;t even worth speculating about because it&#39;s a purely theoretical construct. Real world is a lot more complex than just risk and benefits, and the perception of risk is a lot more complex than just tit and tat.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m not saying the Cold War remained cold <em>only</em> because of risk. But I am saying that, without the considerable, recognized component of risk, on both sides, the Cold War would have been far more likely to escalate. And, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, that as long as the Russian political leadership is not confronted with significant risk, the risk of escalation (both in Ukraine and beyond) is, in fact, very high.</p>\n</div>",

All of them said the pipelines were a legitimate target in Ukraine\u2019s war of defense against Russia.\n\n> In May of 2022, a handful of senior Ukrainian military officers and businessmen had gathered to toast their country\u2019s remarkable success in halting the Russian invasion.

Israel has destroyed or seized crucial supply routes from Egypt into Gaza.**\n\n>The Israeli military also asserted that it had eliminated half the leadership of the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, including the top leaders Muhammad Deif and Marwan Issa.\n\n>But one of Israel\u2019s biggest remaining goals \u2014 the return of the roughly 115 living and dead hostages still held in Gaza after being seized in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks \u2014 **cannot be achieved militarily**, according to current and former American and Israeli officials.\n\n>Over the past 10 months, \u201cIsrael has been able to disrupt Hamas, kill a number of their leaders and largely reduce the threat to Israel that existed before Oct. 7,\u201d said Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the former head of U.S. Central Command. Hamas is now \u201ca diminished\u201d organization, he added. But he said the release of the hostages could be secured only through negotiations.\n\n>Israel\u2019s most recent military operations have been something of a Whac-a-Mole strategy in the eyes of American analysts. As Israel develops intelligence about a potential regrouping of Hamas fighters, the Israel Defense Forces have moved to go in after them.\n\n>But U.S. officials are skeptical that approach will yield decisive results. To prevent its fighters from being targeted, Hamas has urged them to hide in its vast tunnel network under Gaza or among civilians. From the beginning of the war, Hamas\u2019s basic strategy has been survival, and that has not changed, U.S. officials said.\n\n________________\n\n>While Israel has tried to damage the tunnels, it has failed to destroy them, American officials said. Some of the larger tunnel complexes, which Hamas has used as command posts, have been rendered inoperable. But the network has proved much larger than Israel anticipated, and it remains an effective way for Hamas to hide its leaders and move around fighters.\n\n>\u201cHamas is largely depleted but not wiped out, and the Israelis may never achieve the total annihilation of Hamas,\u201d said Ralph Goff, a former senior C.I.A. official who served in the Middle East.\n\n>**But U.S. officials believe that Israel has achieved a meaningful military victory. Hamas is no longer capable of planning or executing an attack on the scale of Oct. 7, and its ability to launch smaller terrorist attacks on Israel is in doubt, they say.**\n\n>Hamas has been so damaged in the war that its officials have told international negotiators it is willing to give up civilian control of Gaza to an independent group after a cease-fire is in place. How long Hamas will be willing to give up a measure of its power will depend on what happens after a cease-fire, and what concessions Israel is prepared to make, American officials said.\n\n>Hamas suffered a significant blow in May, according to American officials, when Israel\u2019s military invaded Rafah in southern Gaza. Officials in Washington had warned against the operation because they feared the deep humanitarian costs. But Israel used its occupation of Rafah to cut off tunnels between Egypt and Gaza, a critical weapons supply route for Hamas.\n\n>Israel\u2019s seizure, also in May, of a strip of land that runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border fulfilled another goal of the invasion, although it portends further isolation for Palestinians.\n\n>The strip, called the Philadelphi Corridor by Israel and Salah Al Din by Egypt, is around 300 feet wide and runs roughly eight miles from Israel\u2019s border to the Mediterranean. To the northeast is Gaza, while Egypt lies to the southwest.

Why are people assuming a democratic China will be any different in the pursuit of its interests which in many ways conflict which the maintenance of the US global supremacy? Are democracies inherently less prone to war or agression (spoiler looking at the U.S. itself I do not think it is safe to assume the answer to this question is yes)?\n\nI\u2019m asking because sometimes I feel uncomfortable when I listen to foreign policy people arguing that the U.S. has an ideological fight with china because it is a democracy and that whatever the U.S. does is because of values and rule of law and democracy. I\u2019d like to think of myself as an objective and realist when it comes to international relations (IR). I feel like the main reason there is competition in the first place is because to put it plainly China just happens to be a dictatorship the U.S. doesn\u2019t like. For example, most Middle East monarchies are dictatorships as well, Israel is commuting in my mind the first live genocide ever but the U.S. does not seem to care, rather it supports to those countries because it believes that it is in its interest and that is fine because I also agree every country should do whatever is in its interest no matter what happens.\n\nI feel like if China decides to stop challenging the U.S. global supremacy (economically, militarily, diplomatic, technologically), which I believe is the real and only reason we\u2019re having that competition, I think even if the current China stays the way it is (communist) I believe many of us will be surprised at how fast relations between the two countries improve or the competition at least will be dialed back by both parties. Why? because one of them gave up, which is the point of the competition. Let\u2019s say to be generous the Chinese leadership throws in an improvement of human rights for Hong Kong, the Uighurs, and the Tibetans, I don\u2019t think there will be competition anymore, because I think a lot of the human rights issues and democracy issues people point out today were still there before and nobody complained for decades. What changed now? The only conclusion for me is that China defied the U.S. leadership and it had to dealt with, which makes sense.\n\nTo conclude, I would like the have your opinion on this because I feel like adding an artificial values based element to the competition between the two countries is counterproductive because the U.S. looks like an hypocrite especially now with what Israel is doing, and it wastes people\u2019s time talking about stuff that doesn\u2019t affect policy that much. Be honest about what you do because everyone already knows it\u2019s not about values but pure power. I feel like people underestimate how honesty like this can go a long way in IR.\n\nThank you and I look forward to hearing from you.",

By 1946 the US has already successfully annexed any territory it would need to secure its geographic position, and prefers to expand its sphere of influence by inserting proxy governments. So making a new rule that \"whatever borders existed in 1947 will just be the borders forever\" doesn't impose costs on the US but does impose costs on plenty of other countries who had active territorial disputes in the wake of World War II.
