Arguably its position is better now than it was during the late Cold War. \n\nAs for what China\u2019s stance is\u2026 it depends on whether the Chinese knew this would happen in advance or not. Putin had visited China just weeks before, so he may have brought it up with Xi already in their talks.

        "body": "**\"When there are five or ten people left in each group, maybe they'll let us retreat.\" Russian soldier reports heavy losses in Kharkiv**\n\nAn interesting article from *the other side*, depicting what most already were suspecting over here and combatfootage, that the recent Kharkiv offensive is turning into yet another slugfest, with again Russian troops as the (un)happy recipient. This is interesting since we seldom get to have \"raw\" impressions from Russian soldiers. the original soldier post is reported to be from: <https://t dot me/astrapress/56830>, useful for the Russian-fluent speakers of the forum.\n\n* Andreev says that the Russian soldiers were sent to Vovchansk with little equipment - flak jackets and assault rifles - and are being \"crushed\".\n* \"We're caught in a firefight - the machine guns and especially the drones - take out so many troops. And the commanders on the radio keep shouting 'forward, forward!\n\nThe article is from Portuguese media (largest daily newspaper Publico), and the original link is here: https://www.publico.pt/2024/06/17/mundo/noticia/restarem-5-10-pessoas-grupo-deixem-recuar-soldado-russo-relata-perdas-pesadas-kharkiv-2094235?cx=bloco_2_destaques_11 I have translated the article in full with DeepL.com (free version). I am putting the article translation quoted in full below, since I think it is very topical for the forum, and most people won't be able to read Portuguese.\n\n> A Russian soldier reports heavy losses in the Kharkiv area, where the Moscow army launched a new offensive at the beginning of May. Of the 100 men who left with Anton Andreev, only 12 remain. \"During the first night, half the company was killed in one fell swoop\", says the soldier in a video released by Astra, an independent Russian news channel on Telegram.\n>\n> Andreev says that the Russian soldiers were sent to Vovchansk, a few kilometres from the border, with little equipment - bulletproof vests and assault rifles - and are being \"crushed\". The very first night they spent there, he says, the Russian troops thought they had had taken over a street, but quickly suffered heavy losses, after attacks with Ukrainian weapons and drones.\n>\n> \"You pass a street, everything seems fine, but then you're caught in a firefight - the machine guns and especially the drones - take out so many troops. And the commanders on the radio keep shouting: 'Forward, forward!' You can't retreat. When there are five or ten people left in each group, maybe they'll let us retreat,\" he says.\n>\n> Russian forces launched a ground attack in the Kharkiv region on 10 May and, according to military sources in Kiev, advanced one kilometre into Ukrainian territory. This advance was part of several experts' predictions, given Moscow's known intention to create a \"buffer zone\" in order to prevent incursions by Ukrainian troops into the area.\n>\n>Ukraine's defensive capacity was called into question and the commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces admitted that the situation in Kharkiv was \"very difficult\". On 16 May, the President, Volodymyr Zelensky, travelled to the front line of combat, after having cancelled trips abroad (including to Portugal and Spain, which he later visited).

I am putting the article translation quoted in full below, since I think it is very topical for the forum, and most people won&#39;t be able to read Portuguese.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Russian soldier reports heavy losses in the Kharkiv area, where the Moscow army launched a new offensive at the beginning of May. Of the 100 men who left with Anton Andreev, only 12 remain. &quot;During the first night, half the company was killed in one fell swoop&quot;, says the soldier in a video released by Astra, an independent Russian news channel on Telegram.</p>\n\n<p>Andreev says that the Russian soldiers were sent to Vovchansk, a few kilometres from the border, with little equipment - bulletproof vests and assault rifles - and are being &quot;crushed&quot;. The very first night they spent there, he says, the Russian troops thought they had had taken over a street, but quickly suffered heavy losses, after attacks with Ukrainian weapons and drones.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You pass a street, everything seems fine, but then you&#39;re caught in a firefight - the machine guns and especially the drones - take out so many troops. And the commanders on the radio keep shouting: &#39;Forward, forward!&#39; You can&#39;t retreat. When there are five or ten people left in each group, maybe they&#39;ll let us retreat,&quot; he says.</p>\n\n<p>Russian forces launched a ground attack in the Kharkiv region on 10 May and, according to military sources in Kiev, advanced one kilometre into Ukrainian territory. This advance was part of several experts&#39; predictions, given Moscow&#39;s known intention to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot; in order to prevent incursions by Ukrainian troops into the area.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s defensive capacity was called into question and the commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces admitted that the situation in Kharkiv was &quot;very difficult&quot;. On 16 May, the President, Volodymyr Zelensky, travelled to the front line of combat, after having cancelled trips abroad (including to Portugal and Spain, which he later visited). At the same time, the Russian Defence Ministry said it had control over nine regions in Kharkiv.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The population should remain calm... our defence forces are holding the lines, the situation is under control,&quot; said the spokesman for the Ukrainian operational groups in the region, accusing Moscow of creating a disinformation campaign to sow panic among residents.</p>\n\n<p>In the video in which Anton Andreev reports on the Russian situation in the Kharkiv region, the Russian soldier says: &quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll get out of this or not, but I need to say this to honour the memory of those who died as cannon fodder here because of certain individuals.&quot; The state media and Russian officials don&#39;t corroborate Andreev&#39;s narrative - they continue to guarantee advances in the region and Putin has emphasised that the losses on the Russian side were much lower than the Ukrainian ones.</p>\n\n<p>The families of the Russian soldiers sent to Kharkiv are looking for them in any way they can, and dozens of posts have appeared on social media. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard from my brother since 12 May, when he was sent to Vovchansk,&quot; wrote one user on the Russian social network VK. &quot;I&#39;m worried because I think he&#39;s only had a week&#39;s training.

But converting this potential into an independent, credible nuclear deterrent would have required overcoming significant technical and logistical challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Developing the infrastructure for operational control over nuclear weapons, including the ability to bypass or replace Russian-controlled command and control systems, would have been a complex and time-consuming process. This would involve not just technical re-engineering but also the creation of a secure and reliable system for command, control, and communications, which is critical for the effective use of nuclear weapons.</p>\n\n<p>c) The cost of maintaining a nuclear arsenal, developing an indigenous control system, and ensuring a credible second-strike capability would have been prohibitively high for Ukraine, especially considering the economic challenges it faced following independence. It would have been a massive investment.</p>\n\n<p>d) The international community, particularly the United States and its allies, was focused on preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons following the Soviet Union&#39;s collapse. There was a lot of diplomatic pressure to get rid of the nuclear weapons from all sides, even though they weren&#39;t functionally useful.</p>\n\n<p>So in order for Ukraine to have become a nuclear-state and use the massive arsenal they inherited they would need to invest massive amounts of capital - and all types of capital. human capital, financial capital, political capital, diplomatic capital, etc. All of this happening in the poorest country in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>And at the end of all this, if successful, they would have been made into a pariah state.</p>\n</div>",

I remember, I think it was Vasily Chuikov (soviet general of Stalingrad fame), said that 16 year olds were the best stormtroopers he had during his battles for German cities in 1945.</p>\n</div>",

I'm stating the obvious here, but no matter what lens you view the war in Ukraine -- demographics, economics, sovereignty -- they *are* fighting for their very survival, at least in the short to medium term. Ukraine's demographics were dire even before the start of the invasion, so they could never afford to send as many teenagers and early 20-somethings to the front the way Israel can unless they want to depopulate their country; demographic implications aside, this would also be a major blow to an economy that's already struggling (to put it lightly); and -- this might be controversial -- but if you send tens or hundreds of thousands of young people to get maimed or killed, what's even the point?\n\nMeanwhile, the issues Israel is facing from even a protracted war with Hamas don't even come close to what Ukraine has been going through. The IDF has a pretty vast numerical and technological advantage over Hamas, but as we've seen time and again, being \"better\" doesn't mean you won't suffer casualties. While I'm not sure how accurate the casualty assessments for Hamas are, if we're looking at over ten thousand casualties compared to fewer than a thousand for Israel, I'd say that's a pretty good ratio. On top of that, a sizeable chunk of young Israelis have already served in the IDF at some point, and some have died in \"peacetime,\" so calling them up again, handing them a gun and asking them to *maybe* give their lives for Israel wouldn't lead to as big of a domestic mess as it would in Ukraine. And, hell, this is gonna sound heartless, but I don't think Israel would go up in flames if *all* of their 600+ casualties were 18-19. Ukraine doesn't really have that kind of history, and if Zelenskyy's reluctance in lowering the draft age is anything to go by, sending even more people off to risk their lives is massively unpopular.\n\nSo, the bottom line is, I guess, it depends?
