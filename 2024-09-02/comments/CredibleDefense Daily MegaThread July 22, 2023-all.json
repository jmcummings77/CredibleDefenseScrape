      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

The US dealt with that in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, advisors needed \"teeth,\" the ability to intervene and ensure embedded unit commanders didn't blow them off. When that didn't happen they barely listened. Even when they were supposed to listen, most still didn't.

Drag in fluid flow is a function of cross sectional area. In other words, if you imagine yourself looking in the direction of fluid flow, then the surface area of the object you \"see\" from your perspective is the relevant area when it comes to drag. The lower your cross sectional area, the lower your drag. So, minimizing the surface area relevant to vertical travel means minimizing the angle of the boat's horizontal axis.\n\nThat implies a 90 degree angle with respect to horizontal is ideal for vertical travel, but is obviously not practical. Instead, I believe the Navy tries to keep it around 30 degrees to minimize crew injury during ascent. Emergency situations can achieve higher angles.",

It would most likely be entirely controlled by Russia, the officials said.</p>\n\n<p>The DIA officials also said they do not believe the movement of the weapons to Belarus would alter the global nuclear landscape or increase the risk of a nuclear incident, because they would be in storage rather than forward deployed, and controlled by Russian forces.</p>\n\n<p>Miller also said the US has \u201cnot seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture nor any indication Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In his remarks last month, Putin said the rest of the tactical nuclear weapons Russia intends to move to Belarus would be transferred \u201cby the end of the summer or by the end of the year.\u201d   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The highlighted part is interesting. Always thought nukes were the most surveilled hostile military assets. But maybe the Russian OPSEC is much stricter when it comes to nuclear weapons.</p>\n</div>",

But maybe the Russian OPSEC is much stricter when it comes to nuclear weapons.\n\nYou can track trucks, but unless you have intelligence inside the facilities no way to know what's on what truck. Well almost no way. Nuclear materials emit small numbers of muons, however muons interact with other matter only very faintly. This means muon imaging has to accumulate over a period of days if not weeks to get anything substantial.\n\nIn any case, since the whole point of moving these weapons is signaling, Russia likely did it in a way they'd know would be conspicuous to US intel. The nightmare scenario here isn't openly moving weapons to Belarus, it's tactical weapons being positioned near the front clandestinely in preparation for use.",

This could indicate that there are manpower problems on the UA side. They could be running short of motivated soldiers, lacking experienced officers, etc. Regardless, his statements don't exactly paint a rosy picture for the Ukrainian side.\n\nNow onto his two proportions. In short, he proposes two paths forward: a frozen conflict scenario or a Ukrainian victory and Regime collapse in Russia. I won't really discuss the frozen conflict scenario, but I do want to discuss his points about the second option.\n\nA lot of the points he mentions to pave the way towards a Ukrainian victory seem like long term or very long term propositions. Things like hiring western generals to rebuild their command structure and eliminating all soviet influence from their military, attaining air parity with Russia, adopting anti-corruption laws and overhauling their legal system, setting up extensive worldwide training programs. To me(a Reddit armchair analyst), this doesn't seem like time scales of a few months to one year, but rather in time scales of multiple years.\n\nThe fact that he even entertains the idea of a frozen conflict and is open to discussing it as a way forward seems to offer some insight on how he sees the war progressing. If he was confident in a Ukrainian victory, he would absolutely not state this because it would be devastating for morale. Regardless, everything he proposes are long term(significant structural changes to Ukrainian army, air parity, etc) or very long term(frozen conflict) propositions for Ukraine.\n\nEDIT: since it seems some people are weirdly focusing on my one sentence about attrition, I'll cross it out so we can have more meaningful discussion about the rest of the tweet.
