Diplomatic / economic reprisal. Increased aid?\n\nVolley of tactical nukes? Conventional strike possible.\n\nThere\u2019s no *need* for NATO to strike back with nuclear weapons. \n\nThey just need to show that they\u2019re not deterred.

They understand that using nukes in a large enough number hurts them as much as it hurts their enemy, and abandoning Ukraine is always an option.\n\nI\u2019d wager that *if* it comes to nukes at all and *if* their first nuclear usage fails to convince NATO to back down, they have nothing else to do but retreat.\n\nNukes are mostly a political weapon - anything else is literal suicide.\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see nuclear reprisals against NATO even after a potential conventional strike.\n\n> If these hypoteticals came to fruition, how much time would elapse between the first Russian tactical nuke and the first nuclear strike of NATO soil?

Hypothetically, if Russia detonates a tactical nuclear weapon (say, to halt a Ukrainian advance on Kherson),  NATO will respond with a coordinated, large-scale diplomatic and conventional military response (further sanctions, more weapons deliveries, possibly NATO support/advisor personnel in Ukraine). However, I personally feel that some nuclear retaliatory measure is needed. Again, that does not mean military use. I see exactly two options that are credible:\n\n* A resumption of underground nuclear testing. The U.S. has maintained a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992. However, it still maintains the capability to perform a shot (the nickname for a test detonation) within 24-36 months (per the 2020 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan). It\u2019s believed that a limited diagnostics test (e.g., one for geopolitical reasons) could occur within months of direction being given. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if increased readiness and preparations were ordered in December 2021.\n\n* The more extreme option, to some extent a variation of above, would be a demonstration detonation of a single warhead near Russia (likely in the middle of the Black Sea), away from land, with clear communication in the lead-up. This idea strains the bounds of credibility for me, but I could see it occurring if Russia uses multiple nuclear weapons in Ukraine, or as a follow-on if Russia does not respond to the first option.",

We don't know as the future is unknowable, but here is a potential roadmap I could see Russia taking:\n\n1) Threaten Zelensky and his general staff with signing a capitulation within 24 hours *or else*. Promise explicitly to deliver to the West what Ukraine will receive if there is any response against Russian assets.\n\n2) Zelensky calls what he feels is a bluff; he doesn't surrender. 30-50 strategic nuclear missiles are then launched towards Ukraine, each with a 800kt warhead (the standard Russian aresenal). Odesa, Kyiv, and Lviv are the main civilian targets, with secondary targets being main rail hubs and airports, including a few launched at the main Ukrainian bunker commands in Kyiv. The destruction isn't total, but it is crippling. Casualties would likely exceed one million. Ukrainian C&C would be destroyed and would need to be reconstituted. Main NATO supply lines would need weeks if not months of repairs. And several million refugees would flee westwards, further stripping the remaining Ukrainian state of resources.\n\nI don't see any policymaker in the West, seeing all that happen going \"yeah, let's do that but to the entire world (including Russia of course)\". Not that Russia would 'get away with it', of course. Russia would lose all diplomatic recognition and become worsely isolated than North Korea (at least, for a time). \n\nMy point being: if Russia really wanted to, it seems like they could 'win' this war--as in accomplishing their colonial war aims. After all, no colonial project has succeeded without a bit of genocide taking place.\n\nHow does the West stop this? Can the West even stop this, outside of promising global destruction--which, if Russia is going to be cut off from the world anyways, might not seem like such a bad consequence for Putin?",

And several million refugees would flee westwards, further stripping the remaining Ukrainian state of resources.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t see any policymaker in the West, seeing all that happen going &quot;yeah, let&#39;s do that but to the entire world (including Russia of course)&quot;. Not that Russia would &#39;get away with it&#39;, of course. Russia would lose all diplomatic recognition and become worsely isolated than North Korea (at least, for a time). </p>\n\n<p>My point being: if Russia really wanted to, it seems like they could &#39;win&#39; this war--as in accomplishing their colonial war aims. After all, no colonial project has succeeded without a bit of genocide taking place.</p>\n\n<p>How does the West stop this? Can the West even stop this, outside of promising global destruction--which, if Russia is going to be cut off from the world anyways, might not seem like such a bad consequence for Putin?</p>\n</div>",

Where we either didn't respond or acted weak e.g nordstream 2 going ahead, germans denying that russians were weaponising energy because they didn't want to close NS2 even though putin was deliberately running storage low in preparation for the war.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut as soon as Putin got greedy, his troops took heavy losses and lost a serious offensive, we saw how well Ukraine can fight. And considering the level of terror, war crimes (bombing humanitarian corridors his side declared), murder, torture, rape..   \n\n\nThere wasn't anything else he could threaten with, before when the war was just in donbass there was always the threat \"Well russia could send in several BTGs of regular troops!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if that didn't work \"Uh oh, what if russia mobilises and wants to take the whole country\".  \n\n\nPutin is a fool. If he just used the 200k on donbass only and tried to goad Zelensky like Sakishvilli or at most just went in any way, he would probably have been able to have the excuse to blow up a lot of ukrainian equipment and infrastructure, been more successful in donbass. **And received nowhere near the amount of international sanctions and penalties**. He could pull out afterwards and the debate would be  **\"I think his invasion was sloppy\" \"No, I think he didn't even send the real units****^(tm)****, what if they mobilised?

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It only worked because we did half the work for him.  </p>\n\n<p>Partly because we believed in the unstoppable juggernaut myth of russia and partly because we did so much work for them by playing into what they wanted.  </p>\n\n<p>Putin says &quot;those aren&#39;t our soldiers in crimea&quot; western media literally says &quot;oh they look like they could be russian troops&quot;.   </p>\n\n<p>Putin sends in regular forces to encircle ukrainians at debaltseve ahead of minsk 2, newspapers say &quot;ukrainians claim russian troops fought here&quot;.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to go on, but theres many other examples I can think of. Where we either didn&#39;t respond or acted weak e.g nordstream 2 going ahead, germans denying that russians were weaponising energy because they didn&#39;t want to close NS2 even though putin was deliberately running storage low in preparation for the war.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But as soon as Putin got greedy, his troops took heavy losses and lost a serious offensive, we saw how well Ukraine can fight. And considering the level of terror, war crimes (bombing humanitarian corridors his side declared), murder, torture, rape..   </p>\n\n<p>There wasn&#39;t anything else he could threaten with, before when the war was just in donbass there was always the threat &quot;Well russia could send in several BTGs of regular troops!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And if that didn&#39;t work &quot;Uh oh, what if russia mobilises and wants to take the whole country&quot;.  </p>\n\n<p>Putin is a fool. If he just used the 200k on donbass only and tried to goad Zelensky like Sakishvilli or at most just went in any way, he would probably have been able to have the excuse to blow up a lot of ukrainian equipment and infrastructure, been more successful in donbass. <strong>And received nowhere near the amount of international sanctions and penalties</strong>. He could pull out afterwards and the debate would be  <strong>&quot;I think his invasion was sloppy&quot; &quot;No, I think he didn&#39;t even send the real units</strong><strong><sup>tm</sup></strong><strong>, what if they mobilised?

Kadyrov published a hyperbolic rant on October 1 in which he accused the Russian military command of failing to promptly respond to the deteriorating situation around Lyman and stated that Russia needs to liberate the annexed four oblasts with all available means including low-yield nuclear weapons.[12] Prigozhin reiterated Kadyrov\u2019s critiques of the Russian military leadership. The West\u2018s focus on Kadyrov\u2019s nuclear threat obscured the true importance of these statements. \n\n>Kadyrov and Prigozhin are bona fide members of the small group of leaders Russians call siloviki\u2014people with meaningful power bases and either membership in or direct access to Putin\u2019s inner circle. Kadyrov has a history of irresponsible statements and boasts that do not always grab headlines or shape narratives in Russia. Prigozhin is not a normally dominant voice either, although his prominence has grown in recent weeks.[13] But their statements on October 1 have had a profound effect on the Russian information space. Together they broke the Kremlin\u2019s narrative that attempted to soften the blow of the defeat around Lyman. Federal outlets had largely expressed hopeful attitudes that newly mobilized men and deployed reinforcements could either hold the line or conduct counter-attacks in the near future, prior to Kadyrov\u2019s statement.[14] But talk shows on federally-controlled channels picked up immediately on the Kadyrov-Prigozhin statements, prompting commentators on live television to add to the criticism of the higher military command.[15] The Kremlin\u2019s propagandists even had to disrupt the presentation of the former Russian Southern Military District (SMD) Deputy Commander Andrey Gurulyov when he started to blame the higher military command for the defeat in Lyman during a live broadcast.[16]\n\n>Kadyrov and Prigozhin\u2019s statement likely publicly undermined Putin\u2019s leadership, possibly inadvertently. Kadyrov specifically targeted the commander of the Central Military District (CMD), Colonel General Alexander Lapin, and accused Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov of covering up Lapin\u2019s failures in Lyman. Putin had publicly expressed his trust in Lapin when the Russian MoD announced Lapin\u2019s victory around Lysychansk on June 24.[17] Western military officials have also reported that Putin has been making operational military decisions in Ukraine and micromanaging his military command.[18] Putin is thus likely responsible for the decisions not only not to reinforce Lyman but also to attempt to hold it--facts that are probably known to a number of people in his inner circle at least.[19] Kadyrov\u2019s direct attack on Lapin is thus an indirect attack on Putin, whether Kadyrov realizes it or not. Putin and his mouthpieces have been extremely tight-lipped about the performance of the military commanders or their replacements, which makes Kadyrov\u2019s statement and Prigozhin\u2019s echo of it especially noteworthy.\n\n>Putin likely recognizes the dangerous path Kadyrov and Prigozhin had begun to walk, prompting push-back by Kremlin-controlled voices and milbloggers against the direct critiques of military commanders. Federal television channels characterized Kadyrov\u2019s statements against Lapin as rather \u201charsh,\u201d while milbloggers argued that the Russian MoD is more responsible for the defeat claiming that Lapin was not in command of the Lyman garrison.[20]\n\n>Putin has not previously censored nationalist milblogger figures, Kadyrov, war correspondents, and former proxy officials, likely because he has seen them as voices pushing for his preferred policies that Russians willing to support him are more likely to trust. ISW has previously assessed that Putin is likely attempting to keep the milbloggers on his side and to use them to establish new scapegoats for his failures in Ukraine.[21] Putin may also have obtained a more unvarnished view of what is occurring on the frontlines than he was getting from the chain of command, which may be one of the reasons he met with the milbloggers in mid-June. Milbloggers likely have a reputation with their audiences of being more accurate sources than the Russian MoD because they report setbacks and mistakes while advancing pro-war and patriotic views. Putin likely seeks to retain the favor of the audience these nationalist figures reach as they promote his grandiose vision for the war.\n\n>The milblogger community may begin to undermine Putin\u2019s narratives to his core audience amidst the defeats and failures of the Russian war in Ukraine, however, especially as their narratives spread to mainstream Kremlin-controlled outlets. Milbloggers are increasingly appearing on Russian state television and in Kremlin-affiliated outlets following the collapse of the Kharkiv frontline and are boldly pointing out failures in the Russian military campaign while exaggerating the need for Russia to win the war and the price Russians should be prepared to pay.[22] Putin likely attempted to win back some of the milbloggers by inviting them to his annexation speech in Moscow and by integrating them into the mainstream media.[23] But mibloggers are fueling impossible expectations and making demands that Putin and the Russian government cannot possibly meet. They insist that Putin seize all of Ukraine when Russian forces are only capable of making incremental territorial gains around Bakhmut and Avdiivka.

But because of the war, Germany refused to accept NS2. Basically the pipeline is there, it\u2019s done, but Germany never filled out the paperwork.

There is nowhere close to enough manpower, but even if there was, it would still be incredibly dumb. \n\nI have not studied battalion/brigade+ level tactics so what I'm going to say is not true, but is based on my best understanding of war.\n\nGenerally, it is useful to think of units having an area of operations or of responsibility (not claiming correct terminology). A brigade might have a 20x20 km area of operations which roughly means that they cover 20km of front and have a total depth of 20km. Depending on context (defense/offense, terrain, allied and enemy force density, manning levels, operational priority etc) the area might be smaller or larger, narrower or wider.\n\nSpeaking of the type of defensive posture along a front-line, you would have a security area along the line of contact where your forward elements conduct observation/reconnaissance and security (shoot if enemy tries to advance). There you will have observation posts and perhaps some fortified positions. But you won't \"man the entire front\", instead you want to observe as much important area as possible and fortify tactically important positions (road junctions, river crossings, settlements).\n\nBehind that you would have a main battle area where the bulk of your forces sit. In a three-battalion brigade you might have one battalion occupying the first line of defense (along with the security area) and have the other two sitting further behind in the rear. Or 2 at the front, 1 in reserve. On a brigade level you would have the first, second and third lines of defense, falling back towards the rear inside the main battle area. Battalions, companies and platoons will have their own primary and secondary positions. So really the entire defense is extremely layered. The more time you have in a single position, the more the men will dig, dig, dig.\n\nAnd behind the main battle area you would have the rear area where the unit level logistics, medicine, repair etc are handled.\n\nIt's fluid and can change depending on the context. Unit level reserves may be held in the rear area, or you could have higher (divisional level) unit reserves positioned in your unit's rear area. Your artillery could operate in the main battle area or the rear area etc. And just because there are observers in the security area does not mean that you do not establish observation posts in the main battle area. Every company or every platoon will have their own observation posts.\n\nInstead of a single front-line-running trench going for hundreds of kilometers, you have a network of interlocking fields of vision and fields of fire. You have reserves on every level ready to deploy to areas that need it the most. A platoon will have forward and reserve squads. A company will have forward and reserve platoons etc. \n\nAnd if your unit is stretched wide and you lack manpower than absolutely the enemy can infiltrate your lines. That's why you run constant patrols and maintain QRF units.\n\nReally though, it makes it wrong to talk of a fixed front line in most cases (there are actual front lines with opposing trench-systems, but this is a rarity). Instead, there are areas (two or three dimensional) that you control, that are contested and that are not controlled by either side. And contested area does not mean that there are literal enemy units positioned there. Areas can also be visually contested (both sides have vision over an area). You also don't need to see the entire area to have visual control, it is enough if you have vision and fields of fire over the probable entrances to an area and you maintain regular patrols.",

We had to leave the city to prevent a large-scale encirclement.\n\n>\"If necessary, we would have stayed there to the death,\" the men of the 2nd LNR Army Corps in greasy uniforms told me casually. \"No one thought to run. But the order came to leave. We left Liman for Torskoye close to midnight. In Torskoye, part of the village had already been occupied by the Ukrops, but there was no other road. We had to break through. We came under small arms fire, but fought back at speed.\"\n\n>### Why the decision was made to leave Krasny Lyman\n\n>Krasny Liman was liberated by Russian troops in April. The fighting here was fierce\u2014the enemy kept us at bay, directing artillery at our lines, using drones to calibrate fire. Then the Rosgvardia came to the rescue with a wonderful device that detects not only drones in the sky but also their operators. Then our artillery moved in, leaving the enemy artillery blind. Infantry and special forces did the rest.\n\n>It was assumed that a future offensive against Slavyansk could develop from this position. However, after a massive offensive in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy, having regrouped, redirected its forces with the aim of targeting the Luhansk People's Republic. That there would be a breakthrough somewhere was obvious. Kiev was pressing all along the new line of defense\u2014to the north of Kupyansk, to the east bank of the Oskol, where in a couple of sections the enemy managed to ford the river and gain a foothold, and in the area of Lisichansk and Krasny Lyman. Heavy fighting raged for several weeks along the front, but the enemy had no strategic success. As a result, they concentrated their main effort in the Liman direction, throwing everything they had into the fight.\n\n>The Kiev command removed reserves from Slavyansk and pulled up tank units from near Seversk, Belogorovka. The strength of the Ukrainian army, which was advancing on Liman, \"squeezing\" one settlement after another, was several times that of the defenders. Foreign mercenaries and \"flying squads\" were again thrown into battle on high-speed lightly armored vehicles. They first cut the highway to Svatovo before taking fire control of the artery connecting Kremennaya.\n\n>All this time Russian artillery kept firing on the incoming enemy forces and aviation worked, but the reserves were only enough to hold open the corridor of life through which our units withdrew from Krasny Liman. The risk of encirclement and shameful captivity had become too great, and the Russian command decided to withdraw. The last of our units had already fought their way through the blockade. There were no more of our troops in Liman.\n\n>### \"Let's fight on, win back what we lost.\"\n\n>I'm driving up to Kremennaya. The last column had just entered the city from the direction of Torskoy. Planes circle the sky while air defense takes them out. This air battle is watched with indifference by guys on an armored personnel carrier inscribed with the word \"Bratsk\".\n\n>\"Everything is as usual,\" they say. \"There is no communication between different units. What is going on in the neighborhood, no one can understand. By the time we get the artillery to work on our targets through the multistage reporting system, the targets are already long gone.\"\n\n>Barrel and rocket artillery strikes the advancing formations from the outskirts of the city. I meet my friends from the artillery division of the 2nd Army Corps of the LPR. They work non-stop.\n\n>\"First they intercepted the columns that were coming from Seversk, then they hit the equipment near Belogorovka,\" the artillerymen report cheerfully. \"We tried to buy our guys time to leave with the least losses. Well, yes, it's a shame, first Kharkovskaya, then Liman. So what now, to tear off our shoulder straps and hide under my wife's skirt? Let's fight on, win back what we lost. Of course, I'm beat up about it, but there is no other way out. Why cry now? But while the lads were holding on to Liman, in Russia they managed to mobilize. We're waiting for our reservists. We'll take them in as our own\u2014they are our own. We'll feed them, clothe them if need be, and teach them. Let them not be afraid, everything will be fine. It's more fun together! Battery, watch out, three rounds, fire!\"\n\n>The 152-mm howitzers \"Hyacinth-B\" spit out shells, our ears ringing, covering the position with a powdery haze.\n\n>### The garrison of Krasny Liman held to the end\n\n>Incidentally, the idea that the garrison of Krasny Liman had completed its task was also voiced by a respected Donetsk commander, the creator of the Vostok battalion, Alexander Khodakovsky. In his opinion, riding a wave of success in the Kharkov region, the enemy planned to strike in several directions at once, including towards Mariupol. \"But they encountered resistance in Krasny Liman and got stuck. To break our guys, they had to cancel those plans and take resources from other directions, but by then they had lost momentum, the shock of the retreat had passed, and the mobilization began. If not for the Krasny Liman factor\u2014apart from the Kharkov fiasco there were many more problems waiting for us\u2026\"\n\n>This, of course, does not negate the usual reasons for what happened. They were talked about after the withdrawal from Kharkiv region: the lack of forces, the mistakes of some military officials in the organization of the defense, the notorious \"five hundreds\" (or \"refuseniks\"\u2014contract soldiers who refuse to fight and leave the battlefield\u2014ed.) who abandoned strategically important positions, the reserves that arrived too late, the lack of coordination between the various units on the ground, the lack of modern reconnaissance equipment\u2026 But the last place we should look for culprits is among those who for weeks heroically held the siege of Krasny Liman, fighting to the death and not retreating until the end.\n\n>\"The group had been correcting the fire of our artillery in the area of Stavkov for almost a month. The guys died in combat against superior enemy forces, including foreign PMCs. The men fought a lopsided battle for twenty-four hours in an encirclement. They did not make it\u2026\" wrote VGTRK journalist Andrei Medvedev about one of the heroic episodes. \"In general, the entire work of this group of special forces was one great feat. The guys were the eyes of our artillery. By correcting fire they disrupted a dozen attacks by the Ukrainian armed forces in that direction.\"\n\n>Most of our units holding the line in Krasny Liman withdrew only after orders.\n\n>Now the enemy will probably try to make the most of their victory. He may move against Svatovo, Lisichansk and Kremenna. This threatens to divide the Luhansk People's Republic, which, like Krasny Liman, is now the territory of the Russian Federation.",

That also assumes that service between the diesel Starobilsk line, and the electrified Luhansk line has been restored without issue at the break where the 2014 frontline was.

More trucking, drastically longer rail journeys, more switching between train types, and more intensive use of fewer rails.

It\u2019s from Iran TG. \n\nTo begin with, I have to say that the internet shutdown this time is extreme. \n\nThe protests are large and are in their third week, although only about a hundred civilians are reported killed. Last time it was 1500. \n\nThis time however separatists have joined in and an attack today killed 4 IRGC members.

While the US may not have any special place in their hearts for the locations you named, they are culturally sympathetic to this conflict to a degree that I think very few foreign commentators have grasped.\n\nFirst of all the foe is the Russians, a historic enemy of the United States. Second of all you have a tyrant attempting to unseat a democratically elected leader. Third, a high number of civilian casualties are occuring. And not to put too fine a point on it, but the civilians who are dying are christian caucasians. \n\nAdded on to that, this war has gone a long way to repair the damage the Trump administration caused with Europe and NATO. American weapons are being shown off in spectacular fashion to potential customers. The whole situation bears certain parallels to America in WW2, with Congress even calling it the \"Lend Lease\" act, and Americans are very proud of that moment in history.\n\nContrast all of the warm feelings for the US this conflict is generating with the absolute contempt the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan created. The US would much rather people be discussing how good things are going in Ukraine than how bad things went in Afghanistan.\n\nI'm a little more shakey on some of this history, but John McCain was very upset about the annexation of Crimea and did a lot to try and raise the profile of the issue and get support for Ukraine. He was well respected by his peers and influential in the armed forces, and I would not be surprised if currently serving members in congress had their opinions on Ukraine formed by him.\n\nThe reason why I am listing all of these factors is to demonstrate how for the US this war isn't a business venture that will be terminated the moment it becomes unprofitable. The national mythology of defending your land from tyrants, the historical pride of ww2, the salvaging of lost international pride, all of these things are valuable to the American mindset.\n\nI think the cost of continued support would have to be truly catastrophic for it to waver, considering that American soldiers aren't dying.

It would be very similar to the error of Ukraine trying to hold onto the Sievierodonetsk salient in June.\n\nThe logical axis of advance post-Kherson is south from Hulyaipole towards Berdyansk. There's three parallel highways along that line of advance. The other two Black Sea cities, Melitopol and Mariupol, are hub-and-spoke logistical centers, whereas Berdyansk is actually on the sea and the autoroute passes north of it, so there's no need to bypass a big city or engage in urban combat to fracture the Russian occupation into two bloody chunks. Cutting the Russian front into two pieces would make it enormously more difficult for them to shift forces from one front to another. External versus internal lines of communication.",

If Belarus mobilizes to enter into Ukr I would expect the wheels to come off pretty quickly and ultimately would do more harm then good for the war effort, which presumably is why it has not been done so far.</p>\n</div>",
