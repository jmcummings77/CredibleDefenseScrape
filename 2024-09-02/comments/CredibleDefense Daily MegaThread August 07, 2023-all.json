The most interesting part is that this occurred near Khromove, in the Bakhmut sector. What we do know is CV90s are fielded by the 21st Brigade, hence: either it deployed a battalion or a company tactical group in the Bakhmut area (at the moment we know it's active around Nevske) or another brigade has got CV90s, which I think it's less likely. Paging u/svenne who is always very interested in things concerning this brigade. \n\nAs far as I know, most of the Lancet actions are the work of either the Spetsnaz or the VDV (in this specific case, the 217th Regiment), and both are being issued more and more Lancets lately. This is definitely a problem, both to vehicles and to artillery, if we realize Lancets seem to make up the vast majority of Russian counter-battery actions.\n\nWhat I believe is that Ukraine might want to reinforce the northern sector of Bakhmut, which despite its very peculiar conformation (Dubovo-Vasylivka salient) has remained overall rather stable since Ukrainian attacks began in May, with the exception of early June when the Ukrainians arrived at the gates of the settlement of Berhirvka. The Russians, however, by bringing in relevant reserves, such as the 217th VDV Regiment in the salient to support the 200th Arctic Brigade, recently the 105th Regiment (former DPR unit) in Khromove, the deployment of the 51st VDV Regiment in those areas, have managed to contain Ukrainian efforts. The Ukrainians, on the other hand, have been attacking in that area mainly with brigades that are not first-rate and were already heavily worn out having taken part both in the hardest months of the battle of Bakhmut and in the attacks of the recent months (57th and elements of the 56th Motorized, 30th Mech, 127th TD).\n\nI would keep an eye on this area - there is a possibility that Ukraine, after assessing to have attrited the Russians enough with the units already in the area, may begin to employ better equipped and fresher units in order to try to force the salient and nearby areas. Beyond the tough battles going on in the southern sector of Bakhmut, I would see that as something more promising than the sporadic Ukrainian efforts towards Soledar from the north. At the same time, the potential employment of elements of the 21st Brigade may suggest that the Ukrainians have decreased the level of perceived danger between Svatove and Kreminna, where this brigade is deployed. In the Kreminna sector, especially in the area of Serebrianka Forest, Russian efforts have somewhat thinned out, partly as a result of Ukrainian attacks on Bakhmut, which forced the Russians to send several units to reinforce the lines in the latter sector. At the same time the density of Ukrainian forces in Kreminna has increased greatly; the situation is more delicate between Svatove and Kupyansk, although at the moment things seem stable.",

Beyond the tough battles going on in the southern sector of Bakhmut, I would see that as something more promising than the sporadic Ukrainian efforts towards Soledar from the north. At the same time, the potential employment of elements of the 21st Brigade may suggest that the Ukrainians have decreased the level of perceived danger between Svatove and Kreminna, where this brigade is deployed. In the Kreminna sector, especially in the area of Serebrianka Forest, Russian efforts have somewhat thinned out, partly as a result of Ukrainian attacks on Bakhmut, which forced the Russians to send several units to reinforce the lines in the latter sector. At the same time the density of Ukrainian forces in Kreminna has increased greatly; the situation is more delicate between Svatove and Kupyansk, although at the moment things seem stable.</p>\n</div>",

Even the finest military minds have been horrible calls, so it seems the gulf between the training offered Ukrainians and that needed to breach the defences Russia threw up was larger than many assumed.\n\nI think Europe needs to have a cold shower and a sit down and realise this war will no longer be won by whatever is sitting in storage in a running condition and some basics in where to point a rifle. This has been enough to halt the Russians but they are now digging in and will continue to dig in deeper.\n\nI think they need to be built from an army of ex Soviet equipment with a couple of companies of modern tanks into a multi brigade army of modern equipment that can fight in coordinate combined arms at night with pace and at scale.\n\nThat is going to take money, equipment and time. Its going to need to train the platoons to work as combined arms companies, then integrate as combined arms battalions then as  brigades. Its going to take time and men from the front being rotated into and out of training. Its going to take training resource currently allocated to our own armies. Its going to take equipment and frankly there is going to have to be a huge crash program to bring virtually everything in storage up to purring in fields and probably some of the equipment from active line units. And its really not going to be cheap, we are going to have to borrow a lot of money over two years to build a 21st century army to clear Russia from the Donbas.\n\nI also think we need to be honest, F-16A is not going to push the Russians that far back compared to Mig-29. I think Europe needs to donate some Eurocanards, they need a small number of air superiority fighters that are low observable so can get higher and closer to the front, have actual modern radars and preferably Meteor to be able to push the Mig 31s deeper into the Black Sea and buy time and space for the other aircraft below running at the front lines. These are front line units in the Luftwaffe, RAF etc. But you cannot operate in that hostile an environment with 1980s aircraft as your premier air superiority fighter. They need an air superiority fighter than can inflict hurt and do it in a hostile modern SAM environment.\n\nI am would not be surprised if the Russians have another collapse and lose Tokmak or even Metipol.

I wish I had the articles on hand talking about this, but I was unable to find them. \n\nThe main reason people assumed that Ukraine would breakthrough in the south is because there was an assumption that Ukraine would conduct division-level assaults with a large amount of forces on a narrow front and overwhelm Russian defenses. \n\nEngineering equipment would've been concentrated to enable multiple breaches in the Russian defenses, even supposing that a few attacks were thwarted like that first assault at Robotyne, some UAF units surely would've gotten through and overrun the first line of defenses in just a day or two of fighting. Additionally, Ukrainian artillery would be massed at sufficient level to conduct both CB and fire suppression of Russian first echelon defensive lines. \n\nNone of this ended up happening. Instead what we got was a dispersed offensive on a wide front, featuring battalion-level attacks, and even those were sloppy. Nowhere did Ukraine attack they possessed the numerical strength to overcome russian positions. UAF artillery did not outmatch Russian artillery and couldn't do both CB and fire suppression. Ukraine's attacks also were not mutually supporting, preventing success in one area from aiding other attacks.\n\n\n\nWhy did this happen? UAF did not possess enough fighting experience to conduct combined arms attacks. Seemingly this problem is pervasive all the way from divisional command element, down to even local battalions struggling to coordinate movements with units on their flanks. There has also been some comments that the problem was worse for newly trained brigades compared to veteran units, but so far I have not really seen much evidence that Ukraine conducts any operations at the brigade level. \n\nOn the western side, I would absolutely agree with you that NATO needs to step up deliveries of new equipment to allow Ukraine to increase its number of mechanized and armored brigades. Increased supply of artillery shells, especially cluster shells, will definitely help Ukraine in the future to be able to attrition Russian units and make conditions more favorable for a winter/summer 2024 offensive. Which is one area NATO is improving the most in.\n\nI would also argue that Ukraine did not send enough anti-aircraft units to its attacking brigades, because it was holding so much back to defend Ukraine's civilian population. The result was that russian air units were successful in blunting UAF armored thrusts where they were potentially succeeding. This is something that NATO could fix by providing more anti-air assets. \n\nHow do we solve the training issue though? As of right now, I don't see any way for NATO to be able to retrain a large bulk force of Ukrainian units. The problem with NATO training is that they're training ukrainians in small batches through a rushed program. The result was plain to see in June with the uncoordinated attacks. To really train an army for a combined arms push, you need absolutely massive wargames, and Ukraine can't pull that many troops off the line for that long.\n\nThe only other option therefor would be live fire experience. The current offensive looks pretty much totally stalled and I don't see any miraculous breakthrough coming. While Ukraine *could* keep its pressure up on the south, we may be looking at a sunk cost fallacy regarding the southern offensive. Arguably speaking, Ukraine could see more results by transferring its remaining reserve brigades to Bakhmut or Svatove sectors, and attacking in-force at areas with less built up defenses. I doubt Ukraine would manage a massive breakthrough, but getting these brigades more combat experience, especially in large formation battles, would be crucial toward a potentially successful 2024 campaign.",

Next time, existing units with experience should get western gear and use it in a fashion they see fit. A combined arms operation didn&#39;t work out, potentially because of lack of coordination and communication, but after attempting different strategies for weeks now, I&#39;m sure the Ukrainians can develop a working model for themselves with Western help.</p>\n\n<p>But honestly, they don&#39;t need to be great at these operations. If Ukrainian troops can stay warm and healthy during the winter while continously pummeling Russian defensive lines and trenches with cluster munitions and constant, accurate artillery fire, any operation in the spring will be easier.</p>\n</div>",

Likewise, armies with weak organization, training and discipline will find chemical preparedness \u2013 which involves a lot of training on how to get those gas masks and NBC suits on fast \u2013 very difficult; actually getting all of the fidgety equipment to the right spots will also prove hard (but is second-nature to a modern system military which has nothing but fidgety equipment).</p>\n\n<p>And, so, where do we still see chemical weapons used? In static-system vs. static-system warfare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll also point out that while Sarin and Mustard Gas are expensive and probably far too politically non-viable to deploy (at least for the west), there is a massive global manufacturing base for CS gas, which can manufacture it quite cheaply, with a long shelf life.</p>\n</div>",
