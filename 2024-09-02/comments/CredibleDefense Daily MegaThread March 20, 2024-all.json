        "body": "An article that details a lot about Ukraine's domestic military industry and its pretty successful attempt at expanding to the size needed for the war.  A mix of both good news and bad news.  Good news is they have been successful at the expansion and that will continue.  (*Before the war, Athlon produced 100 drones a year, Viunnyk said. Now it makes 150 a month.*) But supply bottlenecks, material constraints, and limited funds all hamper the effort.  \n\n\n\n[Ukraine races to build weapons at home | The Washington Post | March 2024](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/20/ukraine-weapons-industry-domestic-production/)\n\n[Archive](https://archive.is/IVcZb/again?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/20/ukraine-weapons-industry-domestic-production/#selection-442.0-442.1) If you want to see the pictures.\n\n*Ukraine manufactured practically no weapons before Russia invaded in February 2022, but the local arms industry is now booming.*\n\n*Factories spit out shells, mortar rounds, military vehicles, missiles and other items crucial to the war effort. Production tripled in 2023 and is expected to increase sixfold this year, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a Ukrainian government meeting in January.*\n\n*Local production is not sufficient to make up for a loss of international support, especially weapons from the United States. But with a $60 billion aid package stalled in Congress, domestic manufacturing is more critical than ever.*\n\n*For certain crucial items, such as the drones that have transformed how the war is fought, Ukraine is already making 90 percent of what it needs, Mykhailo Fedorov, the digital transformation minister, said at a conference last month.*\n\n*Among these items are the long-distance unmanned aerial vehicles that have struck oil facilities deep inside Russia in recent weeks, as well as the sea drones that have caused severe damage to Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet and helped reopen sea lanes to Ukrainian grain exports. Ukraine also builds its own mortar rounds and Soviet-standard 122mm and 152mm artillery shells.*\n\n*Ukrainian defense companies are also moving to fill the military\u2019s greatest need by building their own NATO-standard 155mm shells, which are necessary for the artillery systems supplied by Ukraine\u2019s Western backers.*\n\n*These shells are in desperately short supply on the front, but an official at Ukroboronprom, the state-owned defense company, said production would not begin until \u201cthe second half of this year.\u201d The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of national security issues, did not provide further details.*\n\n*But President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that domestic manufacture is key to Ukraine\u2019s being able to sustain its defense.*\n\n*\u201cThis is the way out,\u201d Zelensky told the Associated Press in December, in discussing the hope that Ukraine could fully develop its arms industry. If these aspirations are realized, he said, Russia\u2019s plans \u201cfor destabilization, expansion, and occupation of Ukraine will end.\u201d*\n\n*While Ukraine has the manufacturing capacity and some raw materials, especially steel, the military urgently needs the weapons now.*\n\n*\u201cUnfortunately, I can say that without the help of our Western partners, our friends, including from the United States, we will not be able to fully meet the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine,\u201d said Maksym Polyvianyi, deputy general director of Ukrainian Armor, the country\u2019s largest private arms producer.*\n\n*After the fall of the Soviet Union, the weapons industry in Ukraine effectively fell apart. Years of mismanagement and corruption, coupled with the fact that much of the industry had been focused on Russian buyers, meant Ukraine had to look abroad for everything from bullets to fighter jets.*\n\n*Ukraine also surrendered its nuclear arsenal in exchange for guarantees, including from Russia, that the country\u2019s territorial sovereignty would be respected.*\n\n*Now, after more than two years of full-scale war, Ukraine needs everything from staples such as bullets to sophisticated weaponry such as long-range missile systems, fighter jets and bombers.*\n\nSome weapons are on the horizon. Ukraine\u2019s minister of strategic industries, Oleksandr Kamyshin, said last month that Ukraine had deployed a locally made missile with a range of more than 400 miles. He did not provide details. Air defense systems and high-precision missiles similar to the U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) are also being developed, officials said.\n\n*But the high-tech systems that Ukraine needs to push back the Russian invaders are a long way off from being manufactured in Ukraine. \u201cTo master such a production, to build such a production, decades must pass,\u201d said Polyvianyi, who is also director of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries, which includes more than 50 private contractors.*\n\n*In recent weeks, Ukraine\u2019s troops have lost ground in the east, as they struggle with dwindling numbers of shells, bullets and even soldiers. And the situation could soon become much worse. U.S. intelligence has predicted that Ukraine may run out air defense missiles by the end of the month.*\n\n*As the White House works to get the $60 billion in aid through Congress, there have been glimmers of hope for Ukraine.*\n\n*Last week, the European Union approved a $5 billion military package and the Biden administration announced that it would send $300 million in aid, made possible by \u201cunanticipated cost savings\u201d in Pentagon contracts for Ukraine. And a Czech initiative hopes to start sending about 800,000 shells in the coming weeks.*\n\n*All this still falls far short of the country\u2019s needs, however.*\n\n*Ukrainian officials say they cannot disclose exact figures about their manufacturing output because of security concerns. But a laundry list of constraints \u2014 from lacking adequate financing to finding enough gunpowder \u2014 is preventing Ukrainian industry from ramping up production.*\n\n*\u201cOur state budget is not enough,\u201d said Oleksandr Zavitnevych, head of the Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence in the Ukrainian parliament.*\n\n*Ukraine\u2019s ability to finance domestic arms production is limited by the investment capital it can allocate, since Western financial support generally goes to nonmilitary expenditures. This year, Ukraine will spend about $5 billion on domestic arms production, officials said, but everyone agrees that is not enough.*\n\n*\u201cThe main defense resource is money,\u201d Zavitnevych said.*\n\n*Raising taxes is politically risky, if not economically unfeasible, given that the country\u2019s economy is already on life support with much of the working population living abroad, fighting in the war or unemployed.*\n\n*Ukrainian officials advocate using some of the estimated $300 billion in Russian Central Bank assets frozen by the West. On Friday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said for the first time that he supported the idea.*\n\n*But even if money is found, Ukraine must confront a worldwide shortage of explosive chemicals.*\n\n*Supply-chain bottlenecks and a steep increase in international demand \u2014 caused in part by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza \u2014 have exhausted supplies of gunpowder and rocket propellants. In Ukraine, this has caused periodic production stoppages, said Ukrainian Armor\u2019s Polyvianyi.*\n\n*\u201cWe will reach the stage where as much gunpowder as we find, we will make as much ammunition,\u201d the Ukroboronprom official said.*\n\n*The Ukrainian government\u2019s procurement methods also hamper production, defense contractors say, with multiple ministries signing contracts and no cohesive system.*\n\n*\u201cThe stupid question every time we get from different ministries is \u2018How much can you produce this month?\u2019\u201d said Artem Viunnyk, head of Athlon Avia, which makes the Furia, Ukraine\u2019s main reconnaissance drone for spotting artillery. \u201cThey have to understand that manufacturing does not work like that.\u201d*\n\n*Before the war, Athlon produced 100 drones a year, Viunnyk said. Now it makes 150 a month. But contracts require months of planning to buy raw materials.*\n\n*Viunnyk said he gives officials the same answer \u2014 he cannot increase production immediately but can build more next year with preparation. \u201cI can do that, but tell me about this right now,\u201d he said.*\n\n*Ukrainian officials say they are streamlining the process, led by the Defense Ministry and the General Staff of the military.*\n\n*Ukraine is also working with Western companies like Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall, Britain\u2019s BAE Systems and Turkey\u2019s Baykar. Last month, Rheinmetall agreed on a joint venture to produce 155mm shells and propellants.*\n\n*Ultimately, Zelensky hopes to obtain cheap loans and licenses to manufacture and repair American weapons.*\n\n*As Ukraine increases arms production, Russia has begun targeting weapons factories. Many missiles are intercepted, but several reportedly have found their mark.*\n\n*Ukraine does not disclose when a factory is hit. A recent trip by Washington Post journalists to a Ukrainian Armor facility producing mortars was interrupted twice by air-raid alerts. No Russian missiles or explosive drones were seen in the vicinity, however.*\n\n*Ukrainian Armor and other firms have moved part of their production outside Ukraine, Polyvianyi said.*\n\n*As a protective measure, companies break up production stages, or duplicate them, and put them in different locations. Some critical processes occur underground. All this diminishes output.*\n\n*Athlon Avia\u2019s Viunnyk said he divided his operation in Kyiv and moved part of it to Lviv in western Ukraine. After a bomb scare in Lviv, he divided production there, too. \u201cThis decreases our efficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to do this, because if we don\u2019t, we could have a big problem.\u201d*",

Ukraine too.\n\nTake a US Army armored brigade combat team (ABCT), it has a tank to IFV/APC ratio of 1:3. During WW2, that was about the sweet spot identified by the end of the war, totally backwards from prewar thinking where panzer/armored divisions were extremely tank heavy and gradually added more and more infantry for a more effective balance. \n\nA modem Russian motor rifle brigade has roughly the same ratio as a US Army ABCT, slightly more IFV/APC than tanks than the US. Same with a Ukrainian mech infantry or motorized infantry brigade. \n\nBut a Russian (or Ukrainian) tank brigade has a 4:1 ratio of tanks to IFV. Why? They're a leftover from tank centric Cold War era warfare, where tanks were expected to play a much larger role in high mobile operations, vs the static positional fighting that defines this war. \n\nThe Russians tried using tanks more in direct assault roles early in this war, and got ate up for it. And they were even using poorly staffed motor rifle IFVs as light tanks*, and got ate up for it.\n\nThe Russians seemed to have learned their lessons as it pertains to this war. They need less tanks involved with assaults, but they still need to be present in every platoon or company level attack, for fire support and to act as breaching vehicles (with attached mine plows/rollers). Less tanks attached to the highly risky mechanized assaults means they'll be targeted less than the IFV/APC.** And it also means needing to find additional roles for the large number of tanks they have when they're not performing assaults.***\n\nThe Russians seem to be launching mechanized attacks at this point because they need to. As the Ukrainians learned in 2023, dismounted infantry aren't a solution for tactical success, they're only one piece that needs to be present. For survivability, they can't move in large echeloned groups of company sized or larger, platoon sized dismounted attacks seem to be the largest that work (anything larger is likely too risky if caught in the open). \n\nHow much usefulness is a dismounted infantry force? I can tell you for first hand experience, a squad is only going to be able to take a small outpost position of roughly the same size or smaller, and a full platoon, at best, can take a platoon sized position if they're weak or fully suppressed. A reinforced platoon defensive strongpoint is close to impossible for a dismounted infantry platoon to take alone. \n\nPlus, dismounted infantry still suffer VERY heavy losses especially if they are caught in the open during the movement to their attack position. At which point that mission failed, survivors retreat, hopefully the other assaults don't get caught. When the distances between the lines are too long, when enemy surveillance is too effective, and especially when more than a platoon of dismounts is needed, that means they need mechanized transportation to cross dangerous ground as fast as possible, with protection, meaning IFV/APC. \n\nBoth sides seem to think mechanized assaults are very risky, due partially to the prevalence of ATGMs but mostly now due to drone directed defensive Recon Fires Complex, and they're right. And neither side has the ability for whatever reason to conduct low risk mech assaults the way dismounted small unit attacks are lower risk. However, while the UAF demonstrated in 2023 that despite having the armor they weren't willing to accept the risk of losing them in costly and embarrassing mass casualty events, the Russians are. \n\nWhile they are taking ground more regularly, and causing heavy attrition to the UAF in the process, they're also taking very high losses too, not just easier to replace personnel but also harder to replace armor. But it's an acceptable loss for them, as it should be, because they don't really have a choice, they're not going to take ground being risk averse, and they definitely are prioritizing taking ground at the political/strategic level/operational/tactical level. \n\n\n*The Russian invasion was performed with BTGs that were horribly staffed, the BMP, BTR and BMD typically only had ~2 dismounts apiece (often none)  instead of the 7x dismounts they are supposed to have, leaving them without enough dismounts to perform proper mounted-dismounted combined arms ops, which wasn't really rectified until well after getting plussed up with numbers following the Partial Mobilization. And even then, they had historically been laser focused on mounted operations, their dismounted infantry were barely trained, so it took more time to relearn assault tactics too, which they still can only really do with specialist infantry. \n\n**Due to added armor and various countermeasures present on tanks but not IFV/APC, tanks will have better survivability than their peers, also why they will suffer fewer losses. The BMP-1 really is a mobile coffin, it's pretty easy to kill them, especially with FPV drones. \n\n*** Besides tradition, and dedicated HE-Frag ammo, that's another reason the Russians and Ukrainians use tanks for long range fire support, including indirect fires. It allows them to use their tanks without the added risk and planning complexity of using them in assaults are closer to the enemy than they need be.",

Well, it should be.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, like the previous time (here for reference: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b9ndh7/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_08_2024/kty58be/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b9ndh7/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_08_2024/kty58be/</a>), I&#39;m glad you brought the Ukraine example up.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>c-pe cages</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the start of the war, threats against tanks were </p>\n\n<p>a) artillery</p>\n\n<p>b) modern atgms</p>\n\n<p>c) MALE drones (briefly)</p>\n\n<p>d) mines</p>\n\n<p>e) old atgms</p>\n\n<p>Against those, c-pe cages were utterly useless against a-d, and against e the vertical roof cages were obviously also useless, but the side slats offered some protection.</p>\n\n<p>If those remained the threats, c-pe cages would remain c-pe.  But new threats (namely loitering munitions, suicide drones, and drone drops) mean c-pe cages came to actually stop common and real threats.  Thus, c-pe cages aren&#39;t c-pe anymore, except as a meme, of course.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s funny because I don&#39;t think any of this was a shock to you?  Yet you chose to cite it as an argument in a place where it wasn&#39;t really appropriate.</p>\n</div>",

Theyre fast, mostly reliable, can swim (if properly maintained, with a crew thats got some brass balls, bad for floatation), and mount two MGs. A 7.62 and a 14.5mm as I recall. Spare parts for them are plentiful, ammunition is a snap, Ukraine already fields a large number of them, and their passenger capacity should work well with what the UA is already doing. \n\nThe cons are twofold: their armor sucks and is proof against 7.62 and thats it. Even a 12.7mm will punch through the hull of a BTR at nearly any range, a 14.5 will do even worse. This is a war when 20mm+ autocannons are fairly normal to see, so a BTR-60 in particular is going to be quite vulnerable. And (IIRC) their hull is so thin that it cannot even take ERA, which would kill the crew inside regardless of effect outside. Add to it, the 14.5mm MG is great against infantry, and unlike the M113 is fully enclosed. But it will struggle against anything more armored than another BTR, including the BMP which (again IIRC) is proof against .50cal from the front outside of 500m. And even then, the BTR only has a single heavy MG, which makes it a primarily defensive weapon. I would expect that even most FPV drones will give the BTR a hard time. \n\nBy way of comparison, IMO a well maintained BTR is equivalent to or slightly superior to the M113. But thats a real toddler fight, neither one of them are really frontline combat units anymore and both are solidly in the APC, not IFV, category. BMPs will be good for rear area units, can help improve logistics, and can help keep guys safe when theyre moving rapidly under say scattered artillery or drone attack. But if the BTR is targeted directly, basically it can do little to contribute to an infantry attack and will do little to protect itself from direct attack. Except, of course, drive rapidly in the opposite direction. But good news, the BTR makes good time on the road, has decent cross country mobility, and is apparently quite reliable.",

It also allows a wider use of weapons and funding rather than just giving them to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>I am just not sure Ukraine&#39;s leadership wants foreign troops in Ukraine at this time or if Ukraine is just trying to make it look like they don&#39;t as part of negotiation.</p>\n</div>",

This will also be a lot harder if China hits bases in Guam, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines on a consistent basis throughout the campaign. If those bases are under constant attack, it's hard for planes to take off and land and to dispatch supplies. Further, if Chinese missiles are as good as claimed, the Chinese won't even need to bother to sink an American carrier. They will go after the supply ships that only got a few destroyer and submarine escorts.",

By the way, the demobilization of the men who were mobilized in September/October 2022 is a topic of growing importance in Russian social networks, but it doesn't seem to be a priority at all.\n\nI think we should consider that these new divisions, at least most of them, should be formed on the basis of existing brigades, which means adding 2/3 additional maneuver regiments (depending on whether or not there is a tank regiment, which is not certain at all), instead of 3/4, and also less manpower needs in support units as well. \n\nI think the two new CAAs are going to be the current 11th and 14th Corps within the Leningrad Military District, with the reform of the existing brigades into divisions and new additional brigades/regiments; overall, the new divisions should be the 27th Motorized (Central MD); 46th and 47th Motorized (Southern MD); 68th, 69th, 72nd Motorized (Leningrad MD); 34th Artillery (Moscow MD). There have been no updates about the reform of the naval infantry brigades into divisions - for instance, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade is still reported that way, and there are no news from either Russian or Ukrainian sources on the 55th Naval Infantry Division which is being created on the basis of the former. \n\nThe Ukrainian observer Kovalenko has recently clarified the situation of the new 44th Corps: it should be headquartered in Luga (Leningrad Oblast - it is unclear whether it will be part of the 6th CAA or one of the two new CAAs); it will be formed by the 72nd Motorized Division based in Petrozavodsk (Karelia), the 128th Motorized Brigade based in Sortavala (Karelia), the 70th Rocket Brigade based in Petrozavodsk; the artillery component will be provided mostly by the 9th Artillery Brigade of the 6th CAA, which is based in Luga too. The commander will be Alexander Dembitsky, i.e. the former commander of the 83rd VDV Brigade about a decade ago and currently the deputy commander of the 1st GTA. It is known that it will host a significant number of foreigners: around 10% of its complement.

By the way, the demobilization of the men who were mobilized in September/October 2022 is a topic of growing importance in Russian social networks, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be a priority at all.</p>\n\n<p>I think we should consider that these new divisions, at least most of them, should be formed on the basis of existing brigades, which means adding 2/3 additional maneuver regiments (depending on whether or not there is a tank regiment, which is not certain at all), instead of 3/4, and also less manpower needs in support units as well. </p>\n\n<p>I think the two new CAAs are going to be the current 11th and 14th Corps within the Leningrad Military District, with the reform of the existing brigades into divisions and new additional brigades/regiments; overall, the new divisions should be the 27th Motorized (Central MD); 46th and 47th Motorized (Southern MD); 68th, 69th, 72nd Motorized (Leningrad MD); 34th Artillery (Moscow MD). There have been no updates about the reform of the naval infantry brigades into divisions - for instance, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade is still reported that way, and there are no news from either Russian or Ukrainian sources on the 55th Naval Infantry Division which is being created on the basis of the former. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian observer Kovalenko has recently clarified the situation of the new 44th Corps: it should be headquartered in Luga (Leningrad Oblast - it is unclear whether it will be part of the 6th CAA or one of the two new CAAs); it will be formed by the 72nd Motorized Division based in Petrozavodsk (Karelia), the 128th Motorized Brigade based in Sortavala (Karelia), the 70th Rocket Brigade based in Petrozavodsk; the artillery component will be provided mostly by the 9th Artillery Brigade of the 6th CAA, which is based in Luga too. The commander will be Alexander Dembitsky, i.e. the former commander of the 83rd VDV Brigade about a decade ago and currently the deputy commander of the 1st GTA. It is known that it will host a significant number of foreigners: around 10% of its complement. In any case, it is said that this corps will be well staffed. </p>\n\n<p>Among the new brigades, overall, and except those mentioned above... 26th Motorized (Southern MD); 89th and 94th Motorized (Eastern MD); 263rd Motorized (possibly Moscow MD); 104th Artillery (Leningrad MD); 273rd and 303rd Artillery (Moscow MD, as part of the 34th Artillery Division); 119th Signal and 42nd Control (Moscow MD); likely new air assault brigades as part of the CAAs; possibly the 77th Naval Infantry Brigade on the basis of the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment.</p>\n</div>",
