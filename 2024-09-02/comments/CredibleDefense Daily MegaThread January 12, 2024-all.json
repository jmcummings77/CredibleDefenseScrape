Leaving aside any potential translation issues, at least the part about FWA losses are very clearly a new statement, very much separate from the Berdyansk and Luhansk strikes, hence the original questions. It's certainly a very unusual and an extremely specific claim made by Zelenskyy, but I find it very unlikely we wouldn't be hearing at least some rumbling from the Russian side if this was indeed the truth - I guess we'll find out in due time if there is even a sliver of merit to his claims.",

Ukraine has been accused by Russia of carrying out attacks within Russian territory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>They are referencing <a href=\"https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/960088.html\">this Interfax article</a> that I&#39;ll paste in full:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The partner states handed over to Ukraine &quot;some long-range weapons&quot; that destroyed 26 helicopters and 12 Russian aircraft over day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a conversation with journalists from the Baltic media.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;The partners know that \u2018some long\u2013range weapons\u2019 that they gave us, \u2018some\u2019 - I won&#39;t say what now, but now, listening to me, they understand: we destroyed 26 helicopters over day, 12 aircraft that went to the skies and launched missiles, against which these systems [Western air defense] worked, shot down. We destroyed 12 at a time. We just had something to destroy it,&quot; he said.  </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Zelenskyy stressed that &quot;this is a long\u2013range weapon transferred by partners, which destroyed the Russian aircraft that took off to bomb us - this is our protection.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;And we did not attack with these long-range weapons, it was part of our defense, our air defense,&quot; he stated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And while, with a bit of creative back of the envelope maths, you can certainly come up with about roughly the same number of helicopter losses as in the ATACMs strikes - there was no confirmed or, as far I recall, even suspected FWA losses back then. Leaving aside any potential translation issues, at least the part about FWA losses are very clearly a new statement, very much separate from the Berdyansk and Luhansk strikes, hence the original questions. It&#39;s certainly a very unusual and an extremely specific claim made by Zelenskyy, but I find it very unlikely we wouldn&#39;t be hearing at least some rumbling from the Russian side if this was indeed the truth - I guess we&#39;ll find out in due time if there is even a sliver of merit to his claims.</p>\n</div>",

I think could potentially serve some value against the 'meat assaults' that the Russians seem to use, but again, where's the BDA?\n\nIf we take this claim at face value, what the A-10 would bring to the table is:\n\n1. Electronics that are interfaced with NATO weaponry. Especially I think this would be anti-radiation missiles and tossed JDAMs. And maybe the occasional target-of-opportunity with Mavericks when the air defense situation permits. The AGM-65 does have a range of ~ 25 km, and it is fire-and-forget.\n2. Spare parts.

                "body": "Speaking from experience (though nowhere near anything as big as the New York Times) consulting for journalists these days is one of the most difficult, trap-laden things someone with subject matter expertise can do.\n\nOutside the realm of investigation journalism (although even in that case people still have agendas sometimes) there's a fantastic drive to get firm statements out as quickly as possible. Making your readers feel in control, like they're on top of facts and know *exactly* what's happening is one of the main drivers of engagement.\n\nThing is early on you have very little material to go by, sources are poorly vetted, and even when they're vetted and actually factually true, you just rarely have enough material to have a reliable (let alone full!) picture of what's happening. As an analyst, if someone asks you what happened, your immediate reflex is hopefully to say that it's too early to tell, and you can usually find plausible reasons to doubt every single version put out there, including the one that's actually true.\n\nBut that just doesn't sell newspapers. Or more accurately for today's media business models that does not funnel enough eyes through social media and does not keep them on the page for long enough to give them ads. People already don't know what's going on.

This would be confusing to most people, but this audience is probably already aware of these events as much as the presenter (*we remember the media fucked up*) and so this is gleaned over. However, if he did take more time here, he'd notice there is **nothing factually incorrect about those headlines**. Posting Palestinian claims in a headline may not be the best journalism, but it's not *wrong*, and including Israel's claims when they came out later is not an admission of guilt.

However **we still don't know with certainty** that's what happened, even though it's the most likely cause. [Basically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ahli_Arab_Hospital_explosion#Analyses), the blast site does not appear to be due to an Israeli strike but the Hamas rocket footage also doesn't clearly line up with these events either and we would need on the ground analysis. But again, this is not relevant as the NYT did not themselves claim an Israeli strike even with a short headline.

How close together two pieces of ordnance land together, out of an unspecified number of launches aimed at an unknown set of targets, based on unknown targeting coordinates, isn't even enough to distinguish between a good guidance system and a random toss, let alone a good guidance system and a bad one.\n\nEdit: to cite something some people on this sub may be fairly familiar with: it's fairly common for inexperienced shaky shooters to overcorrect when they're just learning to fire heavier rifles. Consequently, the edge of the cardboard is pepper-sprayed with holes, some of them so close that the margins are ripped.\n\nThe problem here isn't that videos of successful hits are specifically known to be unrepresentative of real-life accuracy figures.

Unless you're fighting a Raptor of course, in which case you might surprise them once, but you'll probably never do it again once they've learned your tricks\n\nThe original stories were based on leak test reports that showed the F-35 losing to the F-16. Since then, various netizens have tried explaining it away, including ridiculous claims like \"the F-35 was G limited\"  and a lot of other things that don't really jive if you know how dogfighting works.\n\nFor instance, INSTANTANEOUS G's (aka max G you can touch\" and SUSTAINED G's are different things. An aircraft can touch 9Gs - but as you increase G, you increase induced drag rapidly (drag due to lift generated), which requires thrust to overcome otherwise you slow down/bleed energy. As you slow down, you can command less G.\n\nSo even if you were capped at 7G, it would not matter unless you were hoping to SUSTAIN > 7G. The F-35 wasn't nicknamed Fat Amy by non F-35 pilots because of its great thrust to weight, I'll say that.\n\nPlus, [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/BG-F35-2019-CHARTS-page1.gif) surveyed a bunch of operational F-35 pilots that had previous time in the A-10/F-15C/F-15E/F-16. \n\nWhat I've said literally bears it out: the pilots surveyed stated that the F-15C and F-16s had better instantaneous AND surveyed turn performance than the F-35. Where the F-35 excelled was at low G slow-speed maneuvering. All of that bears out with what the test reports said, and why people point out that T/W is not an area the F-35 has over its 4th gen brethren. \n\nLaughably, Heritage included the A-10(!) and F-15E in that chart and in the final survey... yeah, everyone is better at dogfighting than the A-10 or a heavy CFT'd F-15E, but don't mind me, I'm just ranting about that author who is a flat out lobbyist for Lockkheed.\n\n(Of note, the one F-22 to F-35 dude surveyed rated the F-22 superior in all areas)\n\nLong story short: be VERY aware of a bunch of netizens with no real world fighter experience trying to explain away why the initial test reports showed the F-35 losing.
