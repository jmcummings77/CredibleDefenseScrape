      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Hungary's policy towards the EU was originally a more international affair, developed within the group of the original Visegrad countries: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary.\n\nThe Visegrad bloc already had some divergences prior to the war, and recent Czech and Slovak administrations have not been as willing to pursue the kind of extreme maneuvering that Hungary was willing to pursue. However, the unity of the bloc was badly shaken by the war. Hungary effectively became an uncommitted ally of the country that at least one other Visegrad ally (Poland) sees as its biggest and most dangerous strategic threat, and towards which important segments of another country's population (the Czech Republic) have serious resentments.\n\nHungary and Slovakia are half of the Visegrad group, but Poland and the Czech Republic were the primary economic drivers of the group. Taken together, Slovakia and Hungary's GDPs barely amount to the Czech Republic's GDP, which is less than half of Poland's.\n\nSlovakia may join Hungary's tough stance in the EU, and the EU's veto-based decision process does mean they'll get considerable strength in terms of basic representation. But Slovakia doesn't have the resources and traction to fill their shoes in terms of political manoeuvring, and the recently-elected populist leadership in Slovakia doesn't have the firm grip on power that the authoritarian Hungarian administration has.\n\nA hypothetical authoritarian \"joint venture\" between Slovakia and Hungary alone doesn't have too many chips to bring to the table besides their veto. That's enough to block policy but far less than they could rely on when they had Poland on their side when it comes to developing favourable policy. Slovakia has strong economic ties to both Poland and Hungary, but the last decade or so notwithstanding, post-Cold War relations with Hungary have been rocky and their bilateral economic ties are a mix of tough to break (e.g. Slovakia supplies electricity to Hungary) and not particularly resilient to economic downturns (e.g. Hungary's main exports to Slovakia are in the automotive market). The current Slovak leadership may find it more useful, both domestically (especially on the nationalist front) and on the international scene, to work more closely with Poland than with Hungary, in spite of their ideological affinities.",

Hamas consistently works against a one state solution and threatens to exterminate all Israelis in order to achieve it's dream of a palestinian-only one state solution.  After the genocidal rampage across southern Israel, in which genocidal Hamas savages killed 1400 people in one day, primarily and deliberately children, Israel is likely at a crossroads.  The rhetoric is of no more half-measures, no more being content with a humane \"mowing of the lawn\", the rhetoric is now that Hamas must be ended.  The strategic aim is further motivated by Hamas mass war crimes such as indiscriminately launching thousands of rockets at israeli cities.\n\nI take that current rhetoric of the IDF and israeli politicians to mean that they will enter northern Gaza with a large ground force, bite the bullets and kill or capture all 30 000 genocidal nazi savages of the military arm of Hamas.  I think they are willing to take a lot of losses in order to achieve this.\n\nEdit2: it seems retired australian General Mick Ryan also feels that the \"mowing of the lawn\" strategy no longer works (or was even short-sighted to begin with):\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1713675785209594338?t=WGCp3Pi2yxr7a97NqG4TQw&s=19",

A lot of Israelis / people in the west that support Israel have the same bloodlust that the average American had in September 2001. Even worse, many of them blame Palestinians at large for Hamas\u2019 actions. It\u2019s laying the groundwork for some very bad decisions and actions that will adversely affect the future of the Middle East in the short term and long term. It\u2019s shaping the mentality that Israeli soldiers will enter the battle space with. Make no mistake- there will be war crimes and atrocities committed inside Gaza during the fighting by Israel, and it will be publicized to the world.

And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again.\u201d But \u201ctaking out the extremists\u201d there, he added, \u201cis a necessary requirement.\u201d\n\n>In the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Mr. Biden did not explicitly say whether Israel should send ground forces into Gaza temporarily.

Three months ago, vote for Hamas stood at 34% and Fatah at 33%. <strong>Vote for Hamas in the Gaza Strip stands today at 44% (compared to 44% three months ago) and for Fateh at 32%</strong> (compared to 28% three months ago).

They lack power, speed, range and punch. A handgun is like bringing a knife to a sword fight against a riffle. If Israel really cared about their citizens they'd give them AR-15 riffles chambered in .223 Remington and, or 5.56x45 NATO. I'm kind of stunned they didn't provide these simple AR-15 riffles to settlements just a few miles away from Gaza when the attacks happened. They are not even M4 Carbines.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>So I&#39;ve seen videos of Israelis passing out handguns to their civilians to protect themselves in their settlements, but handguns are very poor manstoppers. They lack power, speed, range and punch. A handgun is like bringing a knife to a sword fight against a riffle. If Israel really cared about their citizens they&#39;d give them AR-15 riffles chambered in .223 Remington and, or 5.56x45 NATO. I&#39;m kind of stunned they didn&#39;t provide these simple AR-15 riffles to settlements just a few miles away from Gaza when the attacks happened. They are not even M4 Carbines.
