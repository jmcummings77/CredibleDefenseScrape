As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "Technical research for those interested in the structure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In November the Twitter page of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces had posted that the members of the TDF were all volunteers, subsequently the tweet was deleted. This made me very curious and in recent weeks I digged into the matter. I did several inquiries over Ukrainian medias (including social medias) and spoke with several soldiers and even an officer from several TDF brigades. Nothing I\u2019m reporting is classified, of course. From what has emerged, it seems that the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces are being considerably downsized, and according to rumors their future is heavily uncertain.\n\nFirstly, the TDF members I spoke with confirmed that the vast majority of soldiers in the branch are volunteers and not mobilized. Or rather, specifically, at the legal level Ukrainian soldiers can be either mobilized or contract soldiers. The second case implies signing a contract which length is independent from the war (e.g. 3 or 5 years). Being mobilized, on the other hand, implies serving until the end of the martial law. In the Ukrainian legal jargon being mobilized doesn\u2019t imply receiving a summon in itself, but to serve in the conflict until its end. A volunteer can go to a TRC (territorial recruiting center) and be mobilized there: meaning, even if he is a volunteer, he is legally framed as a mobilized and not as a contract soldier. Those who are mobilized in the practical sense and receive a subpoena to go to the nearest TRC are called \"conscripts for a special period during mobilization\u201d.\n\nAs I was told, 80-90% of TDF servicemen are contract soldiers or, mostly, volunteers classified as mobilized. When an Ukrainian receives a subpoena and shows up to the TRC, he doesn\u2019t know which brigade he\u2019s going to be assigned to: this is done according to the needs and the open positions of the brigades which are recruiting from the territorial basin of a given TRC. A few mobilized may be assigned to a TDF brigade if it has a need and cannot find volunteers, but this is relatively rare. The vast majority of the mobilized, even the older ones, go to units of the Ground Forces.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly recall the history of the TDF. The first territorial defense battalions were created in 2014 during the Donbas War to assist the regular Ukrainian Army, which was in a very bad shape back then. Later, these battalions were reformed as motorized and were framed within the brigades of the Ground Forces. The current TDF was created in the following years, particularly since 2018. In 2021, with a new law, it was decided that it should be expanded: brigades were encouraged to find reservists; in January 2022, the TDF became a separate branch of the UAF. The brigades consisted of a skeleton of permanent personnel, to which were added contract reservists who pledged to join their own unit in the event of war. With the outbreak of war, a very large numbers of Ukrainians volunteered and joined the TDF unit of their province. Before the war there were 25 brigades: one for each of the 24 oblasts (except Crimea) and one for the city of Kyiv. Immediately after the conflict began, 6 new brigades were created in the relevant cities: the second one of the city of Kyiv and those of the cities of Lviv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipro, and Kryvyi Rih (hence the Dnipro Oblast, after all the most populous, went from having one to three brigades), along with the creation of numerous new territorial defense battalions (those of the 2xx-th series, while those of the xx-th or 1xx-th series were the existing ones) to accommodate the large numbers of volunteers who flocked in the initial period of the invasion. In total, Ukraine has 180+ territorial defense battalions, a very large number. \n\nUkrainian estimates report of nearly 200 thousand volunteers who joined the TDF or DFTGs (Volunteer Defense Forces of territorial communities, part of whose members later joined the TDF) in the first months of the war, but to them we should add several tens of thousands among the pre-2022 personnel and contract reservists, and we should remember that the flow of volunteers was significant throughout all of 2022 and part of 2023. The bulk of volunteers who joined the TDF were mainly either older men or civilians without any military training, while for instance the reservists of the UAF and veterans of the 2014/15 war were mainly framed in the other branches of the Armed Forces regardless of whether they went as volunteers or were mobilized. In the first few weeks a lot of people joined without the slightest training, uniform or helmet: hunters who had arrived with their own hunting rifles, eager-to-fight clerks who had been given a Kalashnikov from the local Police depot, young boys who had not even done their military service yet, etc. etc. \n\nThe TDF played a very important role in blocking the Russian invasion early in the war. Particularly in Kyiv, Sumy and even more so in Chernihiv, but also in Kharkiv; in the South the perfomance wasn\u2019t as good for several reasons, but the TDF units in Zaporizhzhia along with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade and several units of the National Guard succeeded in stopping the Russian advance towards the city and towards the M04 Highway. In April 2022, with the Russians pushing into Donbas, a law was passed that allowed the TDF units to be deployed outside their own region; in the following months there was a sort of regularization: those who had joined without any preparation received training and the oversized TDF battalions were gradually thinned out by inviting members to join the new units of the Ground Forces.\n\nThe point is that because they are made up overwhelmingly of volunteers and receive very few mobilized personnel, the net flow of manpower is heavily negative each month, and while the size of the UAF has been slightly growing, the weight of the TDF inside it is getting lower and lower. This is a huge change from mid-2022, when they were perhaps the largest branch of the UAF. Even in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023 they played a huge role in the war, covering entire sectors of the front, as many \"regular\" brigades were damaged and had to recover after the first months of the war, particularly following Russia\u2019s Donbas offensive of spring 2022. The TDF played a major role during both the Kherson and Kharkiv counteroffensives; lots of TDF brigades participated (either through elements or in their entirety) in the Bakhmut and Soledar campaign; they played an important role on the Svatove-Kreminna line, and until the beginning of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 they held the vast majority of the southern front.\n\nIn October 2023 the TDF commander (Tantsyura), was unexpectedly fired and replaced by Barhylevych (a Syrsky\u2019s loyalist), who became Chief of the General Staff last week. From that moment on, more and more rumors, news, etc. began to spread about the downsizing the TDF: the disbandment of battalions, the forcible transfer of soldiers and so on. Particularly in the recent weeks the Ukrainian Twitter has been boiling over this respect.\n\nLet's do some \u201cnapkin\u201d math with the datas provided by the Ukrainian authorities: Reznikov in July 2022 spoke of 700k people in the UAF. At that time the Ground Forces had activated the Reserve Corps and created several new brigades (the bulk of which was created later, between late 2022 and early 2023), the Marine Corps did not exist yet as a detached branch, the Air Assault Forces had not expanded yet. Adding Air Force, Navy and Special Forces, it\u2019s possible that the TDF at that point had more than 250k men (and women), which was probably their peak (Military Balance 2023 had given the figure of 350k men in reference to 2022, which was, however, considered exaggerated by several Ukrainians, at the same time the Ground Forces were estimated only at 250k men).\n\nAs of September 2023, per Umerov the UAF had 800k members, while counting National Guard, Border Guards and Police there were more than one million people in arms; per Zelensky in January, speaking of the \"Ukrainian Army\", there were 880k people: I have no idea whether he was including the National Guard into the UAF or not (under martial law the NG is subject to the UAF, but is not formally part of the latter, in any case it should have over 100k personnel). Zelensky had also recently stated that the Ground Forces had almost 600k servicemen. I find it possible that right now the TDF has around 150k members. \n\nCalm down: only part of the reduction is due to losses, most have moved to other branches, particularly to the Ground Forces. Until last year, transfers were on a voluntary basis and there were numerous invitations to move, in order to replenish the losses in the brigades of the Ground Forces and staff the newly raised rifle battalions within that branch. Ukraine has created 100+ separate rifle battalions, whose structure is almost the same as that of the territorial defense battalions (three rifle companies + fire support company + recon and support platoons). In addition, numerous TDF members, particularly among the younger ones, have left the branch to join, in the first part of 2023, the brigades of the Offensive Guard, obtained largely by reforming and expanding existing units of the National Guard. I also know that recently some soldiers from the TDF voluntarily joined the 3rd Assault Brigade. Second part below.",

            "body": "There are complaints among TDF soldiers that more and more men are being sent to the Ground Forces, and in recent months the transfers seem to have become forcible and decided from above. At the same time, territorial defense battalions are not being reconstituted after the period spent along the first line. It\u2019s possible that in a part of the brigades some battalions have been rationalized, meaning the remaining soldiers from several battalions were merged into one. Then there is the matter of the brigades that are based (and hence recruit) in the regions under Russian occupation, such as Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and especially Luhansk. Ukraine has no control over any city in Luhansk Oblast. The brigade\u2019s HQ is located in another region, but finding men is very complicated and internal refugees (e.g. a man who moved from Severodonetsk to Ternopil in the first weeks of the war) who volunteered often joined the TDF unit from the province to which they moved. Since early 2023 for instance there is very little news about the 111th TDF Brigade (the one of the Luhansk Oblast). At the moment it should be between Svatove and Kreminna, but I doubt its actual strength is greater than a battalion. The situation is better in the 110th Brigade (Zaporizhzhia) and the 109th Brigade (Donetsk, with the Ukrainians controlling the whole Sloviansk/Kramatorsk conurbation etc), but I believe that the 124th Brigade (Kherson) is also severely undersized: it was reconstituted after the liberation of Kherson, after in the early days of the war some elements of this brigade had fought heroically inside Kherson and were destroyed, while others were allegedly compromised by the FSB and did not resist. \n\nOne case is what I had brought up [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1alv5ww/comment/kpicqi0/). The 92nd Territorial Defense Battalion of the 107th TDF Brigade was reportedly transferred to the 110th Mechanized Brigade. Some rumors say it has been disbanded and the personnel assigned to the 110th all as infantrymen - the command denies the disbandment but confirms that the battalion is no longer under the authority of the brigade but passed under the subordination to the OTG \"Donetsk\u201d.\n\nAnother case I had read on the Ukrainian Twitter (the post was later deleted): a battalion of the 114th TDF Brigade was reportedly being disbanded and the men dispersed as infantrymen in the \u201cregular\u201d brigades subordinated to the OTG \"Soledar\", to which this battalion was already under command. The author complained that Kyiv\u2019s TDF (of which the 114th is part) was being de facto dismantled.\n\nThe 225th Territorial Defense Battalion (one of the best of the branch and linked to the Azov-Kharkiv galaxy) of the 127th TDF Brigade is reported by Ukrainian sources as the 225th Separate Assault Battalion, and I have read rumors that it was detached from the brigade and framed in the Ground Forces.\n\nIn addition, reportedly, there was recently an official order that the servicemen under 35 years-old in the TDF brigades are to be transferred to the Air Assault Forces (or plausibly to the Ground Forces too). In the past, as I wrote, there have been numerous calls for transfer to the other branches of the Armed Forces on a voluntary basis, but this order should be mandatory. As I understand it, soldiers who have to move are given a choice of which air assault brigade to join, based on available positions. The Air Assault Forces wants to maintain minimum standards for recruiting \u2013 for instance, servicemen must be under 45 years old and meet certain physical requirements. Given the difficulties in recruiting (there are far more people in Ukraine in their 40s than in their 20s) it seems that at the moment the solution (at least before mobilization is extended to men under 27) is to recruit young people from the TDF. In itself this is a good thing in my opinion, as it is a more efficient use of these younger soldiers, with better stamina and endurance.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the flow of volunteers to TDF units has all but dried up (at least in most of the brigades), and a good part of the battalions, after they have had losses, don\u2019t get replacements, not even from the mobilized. The news of the new TDF commander (Plahuta, a coordinator of the Internal Troops and the Berkut riot police during the Euromaidan crackdown) was received very negatively by TDF soldiers, but some of them wrote that the TDF will not live much longer anyway. According to a rumor  which is circulating among TDF servicemen, the intention is to frame the vast majority of battalions in the Ground Forces (in the best case scenario) and to disband some battalions and disperse the men in the brigades of the Ground Forces (in the worst case scenario). In place of the current TDF brigades, only one battalion per region would remain, made up of the older and/or unsuitable for front line duties members, which will be deployed exclusively in their home regions and will have rear-guard, patrolling and engineering tasks. Similar to what DFTGs do today (we will come back to this at the end). Other similar rumors mention that the young men will go to the Ground and Air Assault Forces while the seniors will go to guard the state border in the North. In the Ukrainian Wikipedia, last week the 125th TDF Brigade had been renamed 125th Infantry Brigade as part of the Ground Forces. After a few days this was removed due to lack of evidence, but a few Ukrainians had noticed that and mentioned it on Twitter: it\u2019s certainly interesting that this change happened during these days. A soldier from the 125th Brigade confirmed that there is something similar in the future plans. A TDF servicewoman stated that the three brigades from the Dnipro Oblast (108th, 128th, 129th) are being dismantled and will join the Ground Forces. Other rumors in recent months also reported of the reform of some TDF brigades (those judged to be the most capable) into jager/infantry/rifle brigades. \n\nIn early 2023 Ukraine created a few dozen rifle battalions (those of the 4xx-th series). These were overwhelmingly framed in the four infantry brigades created in the spring (141st, 142nd, 143rd, 144th). Their structure is very similar to those of the TDF: in this case, the rifle battalions (one per oblast) are raised on a regional basis, and the brigades are one for each operational command of the Ground Forces. The structure of these battalions is identical to those of territorial defense battalions, and these brigades are characterized by scarce mechanization and a shortage of heavy artillery, and like the TDF are often deployed in detached battalions to reinforce certain sectors, which suggests that their HQ staffs may be lacking. They are, however, part of the Ground Forces. This seems to have been an experiment to build brigades comparable to the ones from the TDF but under the Ground Forces. \n\nGenerally, TDF soldiers don\u2019t seem too enthusiastic about the changes, except for those who had bad experiences with the leadership (a large proportion of whom left the branch anyway, barring that transfers to other branches of the UAF or to the National Guard used to be rather complicated in some TDF brigades). The biggest problem being pointed out, and rightly so, is that the transfer to the Ground Forces will not magically solve the problems of shortages of armored vehicles and artillery, and it remains to be seen what will happen to the current not-capable officers. A re-training course would also be needed for those going to the Air Assault Forces: a TDF soldier could be unable to operate with the equipment accessible to one from the AAF. The organization at the front will not change too much, as it is already based on operational-strategic and operational-tactical groupings. But the biggest difference, which in my opinion makes the whole process justified, is the change in terms of the formal structure, staff and bureaucracy needed to manage the current vast structure of the TDF. It must be said that the process is criticized as some sort of temporary solution to the mobilization issues, but this is true only to an extent, as to this day the vast majority of TDF units fight on the front lines, so it would be kind of a zero-sum game. If anything, a goal could be to use the human resources of the TDF more efficiently. Another thing, although it has been changing in recent months, is the fact that some brigades have spent much of the past two years in their hometowns and guarding the state border (including that with Belarus), while others have been almost always on the front lines in Donbas, so this is perceived as an unfair treatment.

At the same time, territorial defense battalions are not being reconstituted after the period spent along the first line. It\u2019s possible that in a part of the brigades some battalions have been rationalized, meaning the remaining soldiers from several battalions were merged into one. Then there is the matter of the brigades that are based (and hence recruit) in the regions under Russian occupation, such as Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and especially Luhansk. Ukraine has no control over any city in Luhansk Oblast. The brigade\u2019s HQ is located in another region, but finding men is very complicated and internal refugees (e.g. a man who moved from Severodonetsk to Ternopil in the first weeks of the war) who volunteered often joined the TDF unit from the province to which they moved. Since early 2023 for instance there is very little news about the 111th TDF Brigade (the one of the Luhansk Oblast). At the moment it should be between Svatove and Kreminna, but I doubt its actual strength is greater than a battalion. The situation is better in the 110th Brigade (Zaporizhzhia) and the 109th Brigade (Donetsk, with the Ukrainians controlling the whole Sloviansk/Kramatorsk conurbation etc), but I believe that the 124th Brigade (Kherson) is also severely undersized: it was reconstituted after the liberation of Kherson, after in the early days of the war some elements of this brigade had fought heroically inside Kherson and were destroyed, while others were allegedly compromised by the FSB and did not resist. </p>\n\n<p>One case is what I had brought up <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1alv5ww/comment/kpicqi0/\">here</a>. The 92nd Territorial Defense Battalion of the 107th TDF Brigade was reportedly transferred to the 110th Mechanized Brigade. Some rumors say it has been disbanded and the personnel assigned to the 110th all as infantrymen - the command denies the disbandment but confirms that the battalion is no longer under the authority of the brigade but passed under the subordination to the OTG &quot;Donetsk\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Another case I had read on the Ukrainian Twitter (the post was later deleted): a battalion of the 114th TDF Brigade was reportedly being disbanded and the men dispersed as infantrymen in the \u201cregular\u201d brigades subordinated to the OTG &quot;Soledar&quot;, to which this battalion was already under command. The author complained that Kyiv\u2019s TDF (of which the 114th is part) was being de facto dismantled.</p>\n\n<p>The 225th Territorial Defense Battalion (one of the best of the branch and linked to the Azov-Kharkiv galaxy) of the 127th TDF Brigade is reported by Ukrainian sources as the 225th Separate Assault Battalion, and I have read rumors that it was detached from the brigade and framed in the Ground Forces.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, reportedly, there was recently an official order that the servicemen under 35 years-old in the TDF brigades are to be transferred to the Air Assault Forces (or plausibly to the Ground Forces too). In the past, as I wrote, there have been numerous calls for transfer to the other branches of the Armed Forces on a voluntary basis, but this order should be mandatory. As I understand it, soldiers who have to move are given a choice of which air assault brigade to join, based on available positions. The Air Assault Forces wants to maintain minimum standards for recruiting \u2013 for instance, servicemen must be under 45 years old and meet certain physical requirements. Given the difficulties in recruiting (there are far more people in Ukraine in their 40s than in their 20s) it seems that at the moment the solution (at least before mobilization is extended to men under 27) is to recruit young people from the TDF. In itself this is a good thing in my opinion, as it is a more efficient use of these younger soldiers, with better stamina and endurance.</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, the flow of volunteers to TDF units has all but dried up (at least in most of the brigades), and a good part of the battalions, after they have had losses, don\u2019t get replacements, not even from the mobilized. The news of the new TDF commander (Plahuta, a coordinator of the Internal Troops and the Berkut riot police during the Euromaidan crackdown) was received very negatively by TDF soldiers, but some of them wrote that the TDF will not live much longer anyway. According to a rumor  which is circulating among TDF servicemen, the intention is to frame the vast majority of battalions in the Ground Forces (in the best case scenario) and to disband some battalions and disperse the men in the brigades of the Ground Forces (in the worst case scenario). In place of the current TDF brigades, only one battalion per region would remain, made up of the older and/or unsuitable for front line duties members, which will be deployed exclusively in their home regions and will have rear-guard, patrolling and engineering tasks. Similar to what DFTGs do today (we will come back to this at the end). Other similar rumors mention that the young men will go to the Ground and Air Assault Forces while the seniors will go to guard the state border in the North. In the Ukrainian Wikipedia, last week the 125th TDF Brigade had been renamed 125th Infantry Brigade as part of the Ground Forces. After a few days this was removed due to lack of evidence, but a few Ukrainians had noticed that and mentioned it on Twitter: it\u2019s certainly interesting that this change happened during these days. A soldier from the 125th Brigade confirmed that there is something similar in the future plans. A TDF servicewoman stated that the three brigades from the Dnipro Oblast (108th, 128th, 129th) are being dismantled and will join the Ground Forces. Other rumors in recent months also reported of the reform of some TDF brigades (those judged to be the most capable) into jager/infantry/rifle brigades. </p>\n\n<p>In early 2023 Ukraine created a few dozen rifle battalions (those of the 4xx-th series). These were overwhelmingly framed in the four infantry brigades created in the spring (141st, 142nd, 143rd, 144th). Their structure is very similar to those of the TDF: in this case, the rifle battalions (one per oblast) are raised on a regional basis, and the brigades are one for each operational command of the Ground Forces. The structure of these battalions is identical to those of territorial defense battalions, and these brigades are characterized by scarce mechanization and a shortage of heavy artillery, and like the TDF are often deployed in detached battalions to reinforce certain sectors, which suggests that their HQ staffs may be lacking. They are, however, part of the Ground Forces. This seems to have been an experiment to build brigades comparable to the ones from the TDF but under the Ground Forces. </p>\n\n<p>Generally, TDF soldiers don\u2019t seem too enthusiastic about the changes, except for those who had bad experiences with the leadership (a large proportion of whom left the branch anyway, barring that transfers to other branches of the UAF or to the National Guard used to be rather complicated in some TDF brigades). The biggest problem being pointed out, and rightly so, is that the transfer to the Ground Forces will not magically solve the problems of shortages of armored vehicles and artillery, and it remains to be seen what will happen to the current not-capable officers. A re-training course would also be needed for those going to the Air Assault Forces: a TDF soldier could be unable to operate with the equipment accessible to one from the AAF. The organization at the front will not change too much, as it is already based on operational-strategic and operational-tactical groupings. But the biggest difference, which in my opinion makes the whole process justified, is the change in terms of the formal structure, staff and bureaucracy needed to manage the current vast structure of the TDF. It must be said that the process is criticized as some sort of temporary solution to the mobilization issues, but this is true only to an extent, as to this day the vast majority of TDF units fight on the front lines, so it would be kind of a zero-sum game. If anything, a goal could be to use the human resources of the TDF more efficiently. Another thing, although it has been changing in recent months, is the fact that some brigades have spent much of the past two years in their hometowns and guarding the state border (including that with Belarus), while others have been almost always on the front lines in Donbas, so this is perceived as an unfair treatment.

                "body": "TDF has some pros and cons. Among the pros:\n\n1) They are, as mentioned, overwhelmingly, and in the beginning entirely, made up of volunteers. Although a certain share of the members are quite old (over 50 yo), their motivation is often ironclad and even superior to that of soldiers in other branches of the UAF. Although the contract soldiers in the TDF had signed up, in peacetime, to defend and operate only within their own region, the vast majority had no problem accepting to fight in the hottest areas - for example, the territorial defense of Lviv, Transcarpathia, etc. in action in Donbas.\n\n2) They are organized as brigades on a regional (oblast) basis and as battalions on a provincial (raion) basis. As a result, many soldiers knew each other even before they join, which further improves morale and creates an esprit-de-corps really admirable for non-elite units. \n\nAmong the cons:\n\n1) Worse-than-average officers. The TDF got the leftover officers and consequently, generally, the less capable ones. I have read of cases of people who were officers in the Air Force and had retired like 25 years ago with the rank of major, were mobilized in February 2022 and put in charge of TDF companies, and promoted to battalion commanders a few months later. Or officers who had been reserve officers during their military service as university students in the late Soviet Union\u2019s days, had civilian careers over these 30 years, and now were put to lead platoons and companies with very few skills to do so. The command is trying to improve with courses to become a captain, which last several weeks and are conducted by veteran officers and aim to give as many skills as possible to aspiring company commanders. \n\n2) The fact that TDF units have the highest chance of being involved in what Ukrainians name \"meat assaults\", or in defending untenable positions. This is often related to the first point, but not only. I have read that the situation is sometimes even worse when TDF battalions are assigned to operational subordination to a brigade of another branch of the UAF, as they are not so infrequently seen as expendable. Even in situations of good faith and respect for them, it may happen that the TDF is given tasks that exceed their actual capabilities. This can create situations of distrust of higher-ups and of the UAF, which might lead to cases of abandoning positions and refusing orders. \n\n3) Lack of heavy equipment. The TDF doesn\u2019t have heavy artillery or widespread mechanization capabilities. A few brigades have mechanized platoons, for example with BTR-70s taken from depots or captured BTR-80/82s, but that\u2019s it. Tanks are almost nonexistent, except for a few cases like the 110th TDF Brigade which has one (or a few more?) T-62M captured from the Russians. The bigger issues, however, concern artillery. Until early 2023 organic fire support in a TDF brigade was carried out only by 82mm (joined later by 81mm) and 60mm mortars. A year ago the \"Long Hands of the TDF\" project was established, which raised funds and bought several 120mm mortars that they allocated to several TDF brigades, along with commercial drones. But the lack of artillery is a problem that exacerbates the second point and worsens the performance of the brigades far more than they would deserve. Usually, fire support is requested to an artillery brigade deployed in the sector or to the artillery group of a brigade of the Ground Forces, but this process can be much more bureaucratic than people imagine and there is not always fire support available, and especially in the short time needed. \n\nFinally, there is another matter. That of DFTGs (Volunteer Defense Forces of territorial communities). These are detachments established on a territorial basis (according to the provisions of a 2021 law) and are subordinated to the local TDF. They are formed by civilian volunteers, which are de facto paramilitaries. They perform tasks in their own city / community such as road checkpoints, monitoring and guarding military depots, infrastructure and buildings, shooting down Russian drones, and in part they also train TDF personnel. If I understand correctly, their members don\u2019t receive a salary from the MoD but are funded by municipal authorities. In December there was a government crackdown: they were disbanded (at least the vast majority of them) and were forced to hand over their weapons to the MoD. In Kyiv the \"Volya\" DFTG - among the largest in Ukraine, consisting of 300 people - was disbanded and there were numerous protests about this and appeals to the parliament. In Kyiv the members of the DFTGs are reported to be a thousand in total and I believe that the members over the country are in the low tens of thousands. Those who are in a position to do so, will have to join the UAF: from \"Volya\" 20/30 people will go (in the DFTGs there are many over 60 year-old men who cannot be mobilized, wounded veterans from the current war or the 2014/15 war, caregivers who are exempt from mobilization, women, etc). In total, from Kyiv about 200 men from DFTGs have joined the UAF.\n\nOfficially, no explanation has been given. Some voices accuse the fact that this DFTG was close to the mayor of Kyiv, Klitschko, and that in general it\u2019s a move to weaken the power of local governments. Another potential reason is the centralization of as many tasks as possible in the Ground Forces, and consequently that could be work of Syrsky when he was in charge of the latters. A few weeks after the DFTGs were disbanded, several new anti-aircraft machine gun battalions were formed, which will be tasked with shooting down drones (one of the tasks performed by the DFTGs), but as part of the Ground Forces. They will be made up largely of wounded veterans or people deemed as unfit for the front lines. Or the DFTGs could be replaced by the older servicemen of the TDF who, according to rumors, could be sent back to the rear. Another theory is that they are no longer needed (especially given the decision not to mobilize policemen at the moment) and there is a greater need that those who are able to should go to the front. Of course, the decision is not just about Kyiv. In Volodymyr (Volyn Oblast) for instance the local DFTG was disbanded and 40 people were discharged and handed over their weapons. Of this group, 19 people then joined the UAF.\n\nI believe official news about TDF reform will come out over the next few weeks, what I listed today are mostly rumors I gathered - I will try to keep you updated.",

This is potentially following a Ukrainian withdrawal from the base.\n\nThe capture of Zenit would be a precursor to the core of Avdiivka being taken. There are only two tree lines between Russian forces and the large apartment complex in the area. Notably, there is only one dirt road out of the area following the Russians gaining control over the MSR going through the city. It would be unwise to continue to fight for the residential areas of Avdiivka at this time.

I know we're only a few months removed from Azerbaijan taking over Nagorno-Karabakh, but a war against Armenia proper would be a whole new ballgame, right?

Azerbaijani President Aliyev said it&#39;s Armenia, not Azerbaijan, that has outstanding territorial claims, while the AZ foreign ministry says the border clash was an Armenian provocation aiming to derail peace talks.</p>\n\n<p>Would anyone more knowledgeable in the region care to comment on this? How seriously should we be treating Pashinyan&#39;s warnings here? I know we&#39;re only a few months removed from Azerbaijan taking over Nagorno-Karabakh, but a war against Armenia proper would be a whole new ballgame, right? What sort of diplomatic fallout could we be looking at here? And <em>if</em> this comes to pass, is Armenia just plain screwed?</p>\n</div>",

The only thing I am sure the author gets wrong is that the convoy of T-72M1s and YPR-765s was not from the 118th Mech Brigade (involved only since the end of July) but from the 65th Mech Brigade, which played a major role also in the first part of the counteroffensive. If anything I wasn't aware that elements of the 46th Airmobile Brigade were involved, but as far as I can see it's plausible as it was in the area, although it then remained a reserve until August. Mechanized elements of four brigades (and possibly elements of the National Guard too) were involved but only in company tactical groups (largely from the 47th, though). One rumor I heard from Ukrainian sources was that the convoy of the 33rd Mech Brigade got lost and they reportedly also hit the other units through friendly fire. Even within the 47th Mech Brigade there were problems, with a company tactical group being three hours behind schedule.\n\nAs for Avdiivka: on the first day (10/10) units from the 1st Corps attacked, mechanized pushes were carried out by the 114th Motorized Brigade in the north-east flank and by the 1st Motorized Brigade together with the 9th \"Marine\" Brigade in the southern flank. In Avdiivka at that time were the Ukrainian 110th and 53rd Mech Brigades along with territorial defense units (mainly from the 129th TDF Brigade) and other smaller units, while elements of the 31st Mech Brigade had been casually just deployed north of Avdiivka (in the following days the 47th Mech Brigade also arrived). From the day after the offensive began, elements of Central MD got involved, mostly the Storm-Z units attached to its brigades but also regular units, particularly the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army, involved in the north-east flank, with the BTR-82ATs massacre on October 19. Mashovets reported that the Russian offensive incredibly took the Ukrainian command by surprise. Only soldiers on the ground noticed what was going on through the morning drone recon. The Russians transferred units of the CMD just very few days before the offensive began, as well as in the days later, to prevent the Ukrainians from noticing the buildup in the rear. I remember a case of a soldier from the 15th Motorized Brigade who on October 11 was in the Svatove sector and on the 15 was dead in Avdiivka. Ukrainian military intelligence had noticed movements by units of the CMD but believed they were headed to the Orikhiv sector to withstand the Ukrainian counteroffensive, or to Kherson.",

It's possible that it was just a company tactical group and then it was kept in the rear until the arrival of the other units of the Air Assault Forces (82nd Air Assault Brigade, 71st Jager Brigade, 78th Air Assault Regiment, 132nd Separate Recon Battalion), which went into action around Verbove in August and fought bitterly throughout September, while the brigades of the 10th Corps were trying to reach Hill 166 and enter Novoprokopivka.\n\nYes, the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade led the actions in the Kamyanske sector, while the 65th Mech Brigade directly supported the 47th Mech Brigade (T-72M1s and YPR-765s belonged to them, in my opinion). As for the 33rd Mech Brigade, it was definitely involved on the first day, as far as I know. The Leopard 2A4s belonged to them (and likely the M113s too). There are several obituaries of soldiers from this brigade for the early days of the counteroffensive: on June 8, for example, a 21-yo lieutenant, commander of a tank platoon, was KIA in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. \n\nThe other brigades provided a single company tactical group anyway, while the 47th Brigade likely provided three. And it was in fact by far leading the actions. I have heard several times that there were communication problems between different brigades and that the 33rd Brigade quite screwed up.\n\nIn any case, I look forward too to reading a detailed and professional analysis with reports from the field and interviews with those who participated!",

It&#39;s possible that it was just a company tactical group and then it was kept in the rear until the arrival of the other units of the Air Assault Forces (82nd Air Assault Brigade, 71st Jager Brigade, 78th Air Assault Regiment, 132nd Separate Recon Battalion), which went into action around Verbove in August and fought bitterly throughout September, while the brigades of the 10th Corps were trying to reach Hill 166 and enter Novoprokopivka.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade led the actions in the Kamyanske sector, while the 65th Mech Brigade directly supported the 47th Mech Brigade (T-72M1s and YPR-765s belonged to them, in my opinion). As for the 33rd Mech Brigade, it was definitely involved on the first day, as far as I know. The Leopard 2A4s belonged to them (and likely the M113s too). There are several obituaries of soldiers from this brigade for the early days of the counteroffensive: on June 8, for example, a 21-yo lieutenant, commander of a tank platoon, was KIA in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. </p>\n\n<p>The other brigades provided a single company tactical group anyway, while the 47th Brigade likely provided three. And it was in fact by far leading the actions. I have heard several times that there were communication problems between different brigades and that the 33rd Brigade quite screwed up.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I look forward too to reading a detailed and professional analysis with reports from the field and interviews with those who participated!</p>\n</div>",

It's the same thing as pointing to attrition ratios and saying \"look, Ukraine is still destroying far more equipment than they lose.\" But here's the thing: Russia has far more manpower and far more equipment to work with than Ukraine does. They can *afford* to lose more men and equipment and still come out of the other side stronger than the Ukrainians. \n\nSo while yes, territorial losses are still quite slow and come at great cost to Russia, they're still gaining ground on the battlefield, heavily fortified ground at that, and inflicting serious attrition on the Ukrainians in the process. \n\nDo I think the Ukrainian war effort is going to collapse tomorrow? Of course not. Am I increasingly worried about the war's long-term trajectory? Most definitely.

It's not inconceivable that the Russians will find some weak point in the Ukrainian line, achieve a breakthrough, and make serious advances before the Ukrainians are able to contain them. \n\nThis is why I posted in frustration and despair a few weeks back, it was clear that the Ukrainians had blown through most of their ammunition and a huge amount of their manpower continuing the counteroffensive for months longer than they should have, despite having no real hope of making meaningful gains. The whole thing was a tremendous waste that showed incompetence and mismanagement at the highest levels of Ukrainian command and it's left the Ukrainian military in a very precarious situation (made even worse by the delay in American aid). And even *those failures* wouldn't have been so damaging had their leadership taken steps to properly fortify key defensive positions, stop wasting manpower needlessly (Krynky bridgehead), and fix their conscription/mobilization problems over the last 4 months but clearly they *still* haven't done *any* of those things.",

The Ukrainian counteroffensive kept getting pushed back not because they were waiting for equipment to arrive, but because their forces were exhausted after their fall 2022 offensive and because they held onto Bakhmut for way too long. They also decided to spearhead this offensive using brand new brigades that received rushed training regimens. \n\nIn other words, they weren't ready to launch the offensive and they kept making excuses why the offensive that should've begun in March didn't start until June. Regardless, I doubt those 3 months really made the difference as far as Russian fortifications efforts go. The Russians had been working around the clock for many months building fortifications around Tokmak and Melitopol using dedicated engineering units. Their forces on that front were also well rested, having not engaged in any operations since the Kherson bridgehead collapsed. \n\nThere are many reasons why the Ukrainian 2023 offensive failed, but waiting too long for equipment deliveries really wasn't one of them.",

                    "body": "> If I'm understanding you correctly, the main threat from a space EMP would be the cloud of charged particles that'd remain after the explosion?\n\nFor EMPs, the threat is also the initial burst of electricity from the bomb, which is going to do the most direct damage to everything outside of its immediate thermal radiation range.\n\nThere's also residual heat left over from the blast, which will sit inside of the thermosphere as a slower-dissipating thermal bloom effect. Lasers already produce thermal bloom in atmosphere -- it's not actually a perfectly inverse square law cone-shaped beam, but a messy beam full of lots of \"hair\" or \"fuzz\" from light that hits air particles and bounces off in unpredictable directions.\n\nIn the context of a nuclear bomb, it's not just one laser beam of radiation, it's a sphere of radiation, all producing thermal bloom in every three-dimensional direction inside of this cloud of heated atmosphere. That will cause heat and EMP damage to anything inside the cloud, but it can also damage sensitive optics and other sensor equipment outside of the cloud because the thermal bloom is producing light that bounces outwards from the cloud as well. \n\nThe effects of dangerous neutron particles are another wrinkle. Those are also expanding outwards from the source, and they are damaging lots of things inside of the EMP bubble and the thermal bloom bubble, as well as objects nearby that are outside of atmosphere.\n\nAs with everything in the context of light and radiation, the farther you or a delicate instrument are from the source, the safer you are, as a general rule. So delicate camera optics and sensors that are only a thousand kilometers above the thermal bloom cloud will take more intense radiation and a larger number of neutrons than satellites sitting 35,000 kilometers above the cloud in geo-stationary orbit. It would also depend on the strength of the nuke.

This single bomb damaged more than 30% of all the satellites they had in orbit at the time.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>If I&#39;m understanding you correctly, the main threat from a space EMP would be the cloud of charged particles that&#39;d remain after the explosion?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For EMPs, the threat is also the initial burst of electricity from the bomb, which is going to do the most direct damage to everything outside of its immediate thermal radiation range.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also residual heat left over from the blast, which will sit inside of the thermosphere as a slower-dissipating thermal bloom effect. Lasers already produce thermal bloom in atmosphere -- it&#39;s not actually a perfectly inverse square law cone-shaped beam, but a messy beam full of lots of &quot;hair&quot; or &quot;fuzz&quot; from light that hits air particles and bounces off in unpredictable directions.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of a nuclear bomb, it&#39;s not just one laser beam of radiation, it&#39;s a sphere of radiation, all producing thermal bloom in every three-dimensional direction inside of this cloud of heated atmosphere. That will cause heat and EMP damage to anything inside the cloud, but it can also damage sensitive optics and other sensor equipment outside of the cloud because the thermal bloom is producing light that bounces outwards from the cloud as well. </p>\n\n<p>The effects of dangerous neutron particles are another wrinkle. Those are also expanding outwards from the source, and they are damaging lots of things inside of the EMP bubble and the thermal bloom bubble, as well as objects nearby that are outside of atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>As with everything in the context of light and radiation, the farther you or a delicate instrument are from the source, the safer you are, as a general rule. So delicate camera optics and sensors that are only a thousand kilometers above the thermal bloom cloud will take more intense radiation and a larger number of neutrons than satellites sitting 35,000 kilometers above the cloud in geo-stationary orbit. It would also depend on the strength of the nuke. The stronger it is, the greater the size of its EMP bubble, the greater the size of its thermal bloom bubble, and the more intensely it will effect objects outside of its thermal bloom bubble with reflected light. For neutron damage, it depends how big the fission-stage of the bomb is -- making a bigger bomb with a larger fusion stage will not affect the number of neutrons it produces.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So it&#39;s basically the same as current anti-satellite weaponry that generates a cloud of shrapnel?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Very different scales involved.

There's also a lot of symbolism going on over 'protecting Donetsk from Ukrainian shelling' line of propaganda. How significant long range fires into Donetsk from within the pocket (!) are is hard to judge in a credible way.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The sentiment that it's not going to be playing a major role for the larger conflict seems to be that the focus is on the defensive, whereas avdiivka is a rather offensive posture. Defensively, it doesn't control a chokepoint or vital logistics hub or similar. Behind it is the same terrain that makes up the vast majority of the frontline. We can ask ourselves that if this would be simple to roll over as an attacker, why hasn't the russian main effort tried there instead of a strong point.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0A loss of a fortified position is never good, however, and framing it as a win is wrong.

How significant long range fires into Donetsk from within the pocket (!) are is hard to judge in a credible way.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0The sentiment that it&#39;s not going to be playing a major role for the larger conflict seems to be that the focus is on the defensive, whereas avdiivka is a rather offensive posture. Defensively, it doesn&#39;t control a chokepoint or vital logistics hub or similar. Behind it is the same terrain that makes up the vast majority of the frontline. We can ask ourselves that if this would be simple to roll over as an attacker, why hasn&#39;t the russian main effort tried there instead of a strong point.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0A loss of a fortified position is never good, however, and framing it as a win is wrong.
