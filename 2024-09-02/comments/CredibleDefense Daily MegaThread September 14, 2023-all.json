One source familiar with the matter told CNN that Zelensky is expected to travel to Washington, DC, after his stop in New York.\n\n>Biden and Zelensky are both scheduled to address the assembly on Tuesday.\n\n>Zelensky is planning to use an in-person appearance at the annual meeting to appeal for more support for Ukraine as it continues to wage a counteroffensive against Russia. Aside from an address to the assembly, he plans several meetings with other world leaders in New York, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\n>Among his objectives will be trying to persuade nations that haven\u2019t taken a firm stance against the war to be more forceful in their condemnation of Russia.\n\n>Among his meetings will be with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli government announced Thursday.\n\n>Biden last met Zelensky in-person on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Lithuania in July. Before that, the men sat for talks in May at the G7 summit in Japan. Despite support from the United States for an appearance at last week\u2019s G20 summit in India, Zelensky wasn\u2019t extended an invitation by the hosts.\n\n>He last traveled to the United States in December, his first time leaving Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion began.\n\n>A spokesman for the US National Security Council declined to comment.\n\n>Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Zelensky in Kyiv last week as part of a trip aimed in part at aligning the US and Ukraine ahead of the diplomatic gathering. The top US diplomat told the Ukrainian president that the US is \u201cdetermined to continue to walk side-by-side\u201d with Ukraine.\n\nHad previously speculated that this could be when a bigger aid package ($2bn plus) could be announced.

The damage to the dry dock doesn't matter that much if the Ukrainians are able to continue strikes against anything in dry dock and thus effectively deny its use. The Russians are unlikely to leave anything at the same anchorage for more than a short period of time in Sevastopol for the foreseeable future, and dry docks by their nature involve at a minimum multiple days with a target fixed in place and vulnerable to strikes. \n\nAlso, if they allocate resources to clearing the dry dock, they would be risking a follow-up strike that might destroy some of their relatively limited naval salvage equipment while adding more damage and debris to the dock, leaving them in the same position they were in before attempting to clear the dock. A dock they cannot safely use anymore. So I doubt they will devote many if any resources to fixing up the dock. They'd be better off building new dry docks in or bringing floating dry docks to Novorossiya at this point.

Officials for the Army\u2019s Program Executive Office for Ground Combat Systems did not immediately return a request for comment from Breaking Defense about the upcoming counter-drone demonstration.\n\nCurrently, the AMPV comes in five variants: general purpose, medical evacuation, medical treatment, mission command and mortar carrier. The Army inked a $797 million deal with BAE in August following the decision to green light \u201cfull-rate production\u201d for an unspecific number of vehicles. Full rate production is a Pentagon acquisition milestone signifying the Army is satisfied with both the vehicle\u2019s design and the company\u2019s production processes.\n\nSheehy said the company plans to finish \u201clow-rate initial production\u201d \u2014 the milestone that immediately precedes full-rate production \u2014 at the end of the next year.\n\n\u201cThat is a huge signal from the Army, that they are committed to the program, that they are satisfied with all the requirements [and] that they want it in the field,\u201d he said of the August contract award.\n\nCounter-UAS capabilities have become more prevalent in recent years \u2014 a trend sure to continue given Ukraine\u2019s successful uses of drones during its conflict with Russia \u2014 particularly among the Pentagon and the US military services. The Swedish arm of BAE Systems, whose parent company is headquartered here in the United Kingdom, has also been examining whether counter-drone equipment could be outfitted on its armored personnel carrier.\n\nNot too far away from where an AMPV was parked on the DSEI show floor, BAE also allowed guests to see inside the personnel variant of its Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which was developed for the US Marine Corps. That vehicle has four variants: personnel, command and control, a 30mm cannon and recovery \u2014 each of which are in different stages of development.\n\nAs the name implies, the personnel variant is built primarily for carrying Marines, accommodating a driver, commander, gunner and 13 passengers \u2014 a number derived to suit the Marine Corps\u2019 rifle squadron size, said Garrett Lacaillade, vice president of amphibious vehicles at BAE.\n\nIlluminating the interior vehicle was an egress light, which is switched on for guests but would otherwise be off until it is needed to alert the crew that its time to evacuate. The egress lighting gives the entire interior a green hue, a color choice specifically requested by the Marines.\n\nLacaillade said one of the unique design considerations for ACV was to mount most of the interior seating and floor to a frame wrapped around the inside of the vehicle and connected to springs. In practice, that means if an explosion took place underneath or near the ACV\u2019s exterior walls, the springs would absorb most of the energy, keeping the vehicle\u2019s occupants safe.\n\nTo date, BAE has delivered a little over 200 ACVs to the Marine Corps, largely personnel variants. Command and control vehicle deliveries are scheduled to begin in the next several months. The company is building test representative models of the 30mm cannon and the recovery variant, which will be equipped with a crane and a winch, remains in development, Lacaillade said.\n\nAs for the show floor ACV, it is not a prototype or used only for displays. Lacaillade said it is owned by the Marine Corps and will be shipped back to the service following DSEI for fielding to wherever it is needed next.",

In the event of an attack against Bahrain the US is committing to immediately consult with its ally and discuss ways to respond, the official said.\n\n>The agreement, which does not require Congressional approval, includes provisions that would allow other Middle East nations to join in due course, the official said.\n\n>The US and Bahrain agreed to \u201cwork together to help deter and confront any external aggression against the territorial integrity\u201d of either country, according to the text of the agreement.\n\n>The deal comes as the Biden administration works with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on a potential framework that would see Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel in exchange for firm security guarantees from the US.\n\n\n>>Saudi Next?\n\n>Normalization with Saudi Arabia would be a significant coup for Israel. While it\u2019s signed historic diplomatic deals with the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan since 2020, Saudi Arabia is the biggest economy in the Middle East, with the government investing trillions of dollars to diversify from oil. It\u2019s also the guardian of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites at Mecca and Medina, giving its stance weight in the broader Islamic world.\n\n>Biden administration officials have been shuttling back and forth to Riyadh for months, hoping to conclude a deal ahead of next year\u2019s presidential elections, but have also signaled that clearing the substantial hurdles will not be easy.\n\n>>China\u2019s Influence\n\n>Prince Mohammed has increasingly looked to develop security and economic partnerships beyond his country\u2019s traditional reliance on the US. Saudi Arabia has turned to China to broker a rapprochement with regional rival Iran that has helped to reduce tensions in the oil-exporting region.\n\n>Concern over China\u2019s rising influence in the Middle East has helped spur US efforts to keep its historic allies onside. Plans for a trade corridor between India and Europe via the Middle East, unveiled at the Group of 20 summit last week, are part of that broader effort to create alternatives to China.\n\n>Privately, the Saudis have asked for firm defense guarantees from the US, access to top-notch American weaponry and for the White House to allow them to enrich uranium domestically as part of a plan to build nuclear power plants.\n\n>Saudi officials have also expressed frustration over Israel\u2019s deteriorating ties with the Palestinians. Riyadh has publicly said that normalization with Israel would not come without a resolution for the Palestinians.\n\n>Bahrain normalized relations with Israel in 2020 with the signing of the Abraham Accords. That agreement was considered part of US efforts to create a bulwark against Iran, with which Bahrain has often had a tense relationship, accusing it in the past of trying to foment unrest.\n\n>This latest security pact is the next step in terms of expanding the US-Bahrain relationship and creating a new security architecture for the Middle East, said a Bahraini official.\n\n>Under C-SIPA, the US and Bahrain will also explore the development of so-called Small Modular Reactors, mini nuclear power plants that could be used by Bahrain as part of its transition to cleaner forms of energy.\n\nGoing to avoid discussing what is the albatross of geopolitical conversations, the Abraham Accords, but this is a more pragmatic approach by the Biden admin and less of a vanity project meant to \u2018solve the Middle East problem\u2019, even if the broad contours are similar.",

Riyadh has publicly said that normalization with Israel would not come without a resolution for the Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p>Bahrain normalized relations with Israel in 2020 with the signing of the Abraham Accords. That agreement was considered part of US efforts to create a bulwark against Iran, with which Bahrain has often had a tense relationship, accusing it in the past of trying to foment unrest.</p>\n\n<p>This latest security pact is the next step in terms of expanding the US-Bahrain relationship and creating a new security architecture for the Middle East, said a Bahraini official.</p>\n\n<p>Under C-SIPA, the US and Bahrain will also explore the development of so-called Small Modular Reactors, mini nuclear power plants that could be used by Bahrain as part of its transition to cleaner forms of energy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Going to avoid discussing what is the albatross of geopolitical conversations, the Abraham Accords, but this is a more pragmatic approach by the Biden admin and less of a vanity project meant to \u2018solve the Middle East problem\u2019, even if the broad contours are similar.</p>\n</div>",

If this happens and China still invades, it will be through a direct attack on the US Navy. I cannot see a world that (a) the US does not send an armada to stop the Taiwanese invasion or (b) that a Chinese direct attack would not lead to complete escalation and a formal declaration of war. Sure, you can consider that both parties would show restraint and not use nuclear weapons over Taiwan at first, but then you get a rather similar question to Russia-Ukraine: what's the path to peace? If China rolls the dice this hard, I seriously doubt they would just accept a white peace, specially if the US attacks targets in mainland China. They can very well have the strength to take over Taiwan, as bloody as this battle will be, very likely with US blood being spilled. \n\nThis has too many dominoes to fall, sure, but I cannot see a way that this Sino-Taiwanese conflict wouldn't drag the US towards a formal declaration of war. A thing as much as a No Fly Zone would trigger that and we're talking about a Chinese invasion force that would need to actually target USN vessels to disembark in Taiwan. After that, we are talking about the two biggest economies in the world, both with a healthy nuclear arsenal, fighting right at the doorstep of Korea. It wouldn't take a lot for Pyongyang to send an attack on Seoul in the middle of chaos. In fact, it would take an abnormal amount of restraint for both parties to avoid escalation beyond the Taiwanese strait and this restraint would equal not invading to start with, which is what I'm sure China will not do. I don't think they are ever invading Taiwan unless the global situation changes radically. However, if they invade, the US is answering directly and both of them has the nuclear capacity to end the world, therefore, MAD.",

Part of the reason Ukraine's fighting so furiously for Robotyne is that Russia is, and they still are like 15 days after losing it.\n\nThat being said, while this costs Russia more manpower that they'll need in the long term, it doesn't necessarily mean Russia will collapse in the short term.  \n\nBasically, I'm skeptical of attrition causing an immediate RU collapse of any sort - I think the most likely case if current attrition trends hold is mutual exhaustion, which would absolutely not be a won counteroffensive.\n\nWe have semi-decent numbers for only one attrition category and that's vehicles.

But that's still much worse than their ratios they hold outside of offensives, which is like 2.5 in Ukraine's favour! And just barely matching your opponent in attrition isn't exactly great if your new theory of victory is **by attrition**.\n\nIn other words, this might cause Russia problems down the line, but it might be a successful strategy to sacrifice more manpower than they otherwise would have had to in order to force the offensive to culminate without breaching their defensive lines.  In a normal war, this wouldn't be a valid strategy since the other guy will just... launch another offensive.

So it reduces the demand for US long range fires in Europe for the long term and frees the US to focus on the pacific, which fits with the US \"Europeanization\" strategy for supplying Ukraine.

You're free to cite sources for that claim and I'd have then to find my own. \n\nIn any case, you made another claim that costs for shipping under wartime are incomparably higher than during peacetime. This is of course true, but since we're talking about comandeering smalli g civilian ships who've been delivering goods to Crimea, what additional costs do we have except for (auto) insurance? And while that's a significant cost, I don't see what this cost has to do with the size of the ships being used - to the contrary, the smaller the ship, the less loss there is for the same attack. \n\nAdditionally, the 5km ferry distance from port Kavkaz to port Krym greatly reduces the throughput issues you mentioned from using smaller ships. I also don't see why you're talking about the boats being \"not fit for purpose\". You can from the current large cargo ships and ferries to smaller ~100 TEU ships without having to improvise - these are still purpose-built cargo vessels, just considerably cheaper and smaller, only a few million each. \n\nWe're talking as if Crimea wasn't supplied before the bridge. It was, and the ships weren't particularly large - the Annenkov, for example, before being scrapped was one of the main train ferries and only had 3000 tons of capacity (https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:350649/mmsi:-8841450/imo:8841450/vessel:ANNENKOV).\n\nIf you want numbers though, the port of Kerch is not even suited to more than 200'000 tons of capacity per month, even according to Russian media (https://en.portnews.ru/comments/2353/) \n\nAgain even according to Russian media, the ferry line is only two ships - Kerch-2 and Yeisk (https://crimeaports.ru/en/affiliates/kerch-ferry-service). Of these, the largest is the Kerch-2, who can only carry 20 trucks, for generously 1000 tons of capacity. If at it's peak with two Kerch-2-like ships and 3 Annenkov like ships the total ferry capacity was 12'000 tons per day, we aren't talking significant numbers. A single 9000 ton DWT RoRo ferry is only around 15 million dollars new, and a 100 TEU~4000 ton ship is only around a few million dollars (though there are no great sources, so that's from ship brokerage websites) . I don't see how, even buying ten spare ships, the cost can be much above a billion dollars a year. The ship itself is barely worth more than the cruise missile you'd presumably use to hit it.\n\nGiven this I just don't see how, even with significant attrition and the need to buy new ships, running a ferry line is somehow going to bankrupt the Russian state budget and cause some sort of forced retreat out of Crimea. It just makes no sense. If you have better sources or a better analysis, feel free, because up until now no one provided any kind of evidence to that.",
