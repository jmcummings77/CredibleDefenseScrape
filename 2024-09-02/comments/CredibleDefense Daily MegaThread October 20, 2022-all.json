As little as one hopes from\nThe Russian military, accidental missile launches from frontline fighters are a bit much. By all means this wasn\u2019t a dumb rocket.

But for many in Congress, including some Republicans, McCarthy\u2019s comments only heightened the urgency of going big on a Ukraine aid package in December before the California Republican likely takes the reins of the House.\n\n>Privately, Biden aides believe that McCarthy will blink and keep the funnel open to Ukraine, at least for a while, though he may insist on smaller numbers.\n\n>For now, what\u2019s clear is that Republicans are increasingly divided between the McCarthy camp \u2014 dubious of more multi-billion-dollar boosts to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the U.S. economy veers toward recession \u2014 and the McConnell camp, which remains supportive of additional aid.\n\n>Dozens of House Republicans \u2014 57 of whom voted against a $40 billion aid package in May \u2014 agree with McCarthy. Recent polling, too, has shown an erosion of GOP support for Ukraine funding. A September Pew Research poll found that a third of Republicans believe the U.S. is providing too much support for Ukraine, up from just 9 percent at the beginning of the war.\n\n>\u201cIt may be that the administration will have no choice but to ask for more money in December,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a staunch White House ally. \u201cBut that might not be the right time for Ukraine. So this is a brand new world, with Republicans openly advertising that they are prepping to hand Ukraine to Putin.\u201d Murphy warned that the effect on Ukraine\u2019s planning \u201cis potentially seismic,\u201d possibly forcing Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cto start making decisions right now if they think that McCarthy and House Republicans are going to cut and run on them in January.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s posture on the issue reflects growing concerns about the stability of the Western alliance when it comes to supporting Ukraine and enforcing sanctions on Russia. Far-right leaders across Europe have signaled an uneasiness with maintaining the war effort, citing economic pain at home fueled in part by rising energy costs, a casualty of the U.S.-led sanctions targeting Moscow.\n\nThis article has good news and bad news. The good news is that whoever wins the midterms is unlikely to massively impact the short-term supply of aid to Ukraine. McCarthy is a bit of a waffle, and Biden's advisors think he could be persuaded to still send aid despite his previous statements, although the amount would likely be lower than the current setup where the Democrats control both houses of Congress.\n\nthat said, people need to realize that support for Ukraine isn't infinite, and sending aid might become difficult sooner than people realize. Ukraine is completely dependent on foreign support for its finances and war supplies, so any disruption or reduction could have significant battlefield consequences.

But for many in Congress, including some Republicans, McCarthy\u2019s comments only heightened the urgency of going big on a Ukraine aid package in December before the California Republican likely takes the reins of the House.</p>\n\n<p>Privately, Biden aides believe that McCarthy will blink and keep the funnel open to Ukraine, at least for a while, though he may insist on smaller numbers.</p>\n\n<p>For now, what\u2019s clear is that Republicans are increasingly divided between the McCarthy camp \u2014 dubious of more multi-billion-dollar boosts to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the U.S. economy veers toward recession \u2014 and the McConnell camp, which remains supportive of additional aid.</p>\n\n<p>Dozens of House Republicans \u2014 57 of whom voted against a $40 billion aid package in May \u2014 agree with McCarthy. Recent polling, too, has shown an erosion of GOP support for Ukraine funding. A September Pew Research poll found that a third of Republicans believe the U.S. is providing too much support for Ukraine, up from just 9 percent at the beginning of the war.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt may be that the administration will have no choice but to ask for more money in December,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a staunch White House ally. \u201cBut that might not be the right time for Ukraine. So this is a brand new world, with Republicans openly advertising that they are prepping to hand Ukraine to Putin.\u201d Murphy warned that the effect on Ukraine\u2019s planning \u201cis potentially seismic,\u201d possibly forcing Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cto start making decisions right now if they think that McCarthy and House Republicans are going to cut and run on them in January.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s posture on the issue reflects growing concerns about the stability of the Western alliance when it comes to supporting Ukraine and enforcing sanctions on Russia. Far-right leaders across Europe have signaled an uneasiness with maintaining the war effort, citing economic pain at home fueled in part by rising energy costs, a casualty of the U.S.-led sanctions targeting Moscow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This article has good news and bad news. The good news is that whoever wins the midterms is unlikely to massively impact the short-term supply of aid to Ukraine. McCarthy is a bit of a waffle, and Biden&#39;s advisors think he could be persuaded to still send aid despite his previous statements, although the amount would likely be lower than the current setup where the Democrats control both houses of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>that said, people need to realize that support for Ukraine isn&#39;t infinite, and sending aid might become difficult sooner than people realize. Ukraine is completely dependent on foreign support for its finances and war supplies, so any disruption or reduction could have significant battlefield consequences. This is exactly the type of scenario that Putin has been banking on.</p>\n</div>",

They're often done in conjunction with some sort of deception plan to hide them. Secrecy and coordination are paramount. At that point the rear guards leap frog backwards, heavily reliant on artillery to create  things like curtain fire, as well as using mines, ambushes, and other means to discourage pursuit.\n\nIf the Russians retreat from the Kherson bridgehead, it's too large to do in one day. The overall perimeter is far enough away from the river and too densely manned for all of them to retreat at a time, reach the river, and cross by whatever means, without leaving themselves extremely vulnerable. They'll have to incrementally shrink the bridgehead eastwards towards the river, with separate new sectors based off of crossing points. Likely at some point those shrinking sectors will lose contact with one another, going from one connected operational bridgehead to multiple tactical bridgeheads with gaps in between, with each controlling their own line of communication to cross the Dnieper (bridge, ferries, barges, etc). The closer they get to the river, the more they'll be reliant on fires from the east side.\n\nThe problem is that right now there is a media blackout nationwide on most of the fighting, so the news we're used to after eight months of rather open reporting is far less than what we're used to. Twitter and telegram reporting is notoriously unreliable, not worth trusting. That means the signs of a retreat might not be seen/heard of until already occurred, assuming they do.\n\nIf the retreat happens and if word gets out by a \"credible\" source that doesn't outright declare the Russians are retreating (and there are good reasons to keep that quiet), we can still learn it's happening as certain steps will need to happen, and those might get reporting on. Like the shrinking of the Russian perimeters will lead to the Ukrainians advancing deeply across the whole frontage, so that will appear like a major Ukraine offensive started that is widely successful, with lots of land liberated. It's very unlikely that the UA govt will keep silent if suddenly they collapse half the bridgehead in 1-2 days, they'll be ecstatic and desperate to report it. So if a new large scale offensive starts and the lines suddenly dramatically shift without accompanying reports of major Russian casualties, chaos, routes, mass captures or surrenders, that will likely be the retreat. If those things are happening, that might mean no retreat but the UAF launched a major successful offensive and are legitimately breaking through everywhere , or there was a retreat but the Russians botched it. Or reports are propaganda, you never know, as a lot of the immediate press releases given out during this war have been total bullshit.\n\nI personally don't think the retreat started yet, but I do think it's in the planning stages. Doing it without a secure means to cross the river will be extremely risky. A deception plan won't work with NATO and Ukraine ISR both heavily focused on the overall operational area. Smoke screens won't work in the age of thermals, and the overall area is too big. However, just a few days ago the Russian govt ordered the evacuation of the Ukrainian noncombatants in Kherson city, and also declared martial law to make that evacuation and other measures \"legal.\" That'll be the perfect cover to hide their troops among the civilians as they walk/drive out, which is unethical and illegal, but not something the Russians wouldn't do, especially to survive. That can work assuming the Ukrainians don't engage their own people just to get at the Russians, or attempt to destroy the means for their own people to escape an increasingly dangerous battlefield. If they do either, the Russians are screwed and whatever retreat plan they come up with is going to be chaotic and have limited success.",

The main value of the west bank Kherson area (as a whole) is to delay ZSU actions on Nova Kakhovka, which is an enormous risk to Krim. \n\nAnything else, like holding Kherson city, is (in my opinions) more of a liability than of an aid. I see some persons speculate that North Kherson group will withdraw over the Inhulets if the Beryslav line is broken, to regroup at the city, but this is not a logical action - you will only risk encircle yourself there. The sides of the Inhulets are also NOT of such importance when there is already a multi-direction threat on both sides. If anything, the Inhulets is (now) more of a hindrance to the Russian side than an aid/defense - the ZSU can use it as a blocking line too.. As such, it is likely of a good idea to leave this side of the Inhulets, before the dam's side is at risk.\n\nI would ask for the cautions, however - last week, I am seeing people sharing statements that the ENTIRE west bank of Kherson will be empty in \"a few days\", but this is of an unlikely nature. Already a week has gone, and many of the statements are not materialized. I have cautioned this last week, people must set logical expectations, the Russians are not \"made of cloth\"\n\nIt is the FULL interest of Russia to delay actions as much as possible on Nova Kakhovka for now. In fact, their entire line in north Kherson (pinned on Borozenske - Bruskynske + the funny risk at Chkalove) is such an action; and perhaps quite likely to be reinforced (maybe even with Kherson city forces) later. There are also further lines for the dam direction, eg. Novokairy/Beryslav. Regardless, there will be difficult choices for the Russians in the coming months.\n\nAnother thing, some people are asking (and making messages) why Russia will not simply destroy the Nova Kakhovka dam - permanently eliminating the severe risk to Krim from this direction. I can say, I do not know - it is possible they may be as desperate as to do this. I do not think so, for several speculative reasons:\n\n1. It is easier to perpetually destroy any small obstruction UA is putting for the blockage of the Crimean Canal, rather than make necessary to rebuild the entire dam when (in their minds) they eventually recapture/negotiate this area.\n2. The agricultural catastrophe will be of a massive and lasting nature, and will affect a huge sector of South Ukraine, most of it which they now consider \"of Russia proper\". Same with eliminating deep water navigations in the Dniester.\n3. There are fantasies that they will retake that side later, with the mobilizations, and the dam is very needed for this. Unlike some speculate, it is still much in Rus interest to reach actions on Odessa - they have not fully abandoned this. I am sure some ZSU officers can share their opinions in agreement on this... The Russians will not stop with their \"Taurida area\", if they are in a position not to.\n4. Once the risk to Krim is severe enough for them to consider such a drastic actions, it will (likely) already be too late, and a futile action. Russian side is still quite reactionary in the political side of the decisions, it is difficult to imagine them making such a sacrifice in advance, if they still see other ways.\n5. There are some risks of causing problems with the nuclear plant - these are potentially overstated, but real regardless, especially in a \"global relations\" sense\n\nI have found it a futility/stupidity to make speculations, but in sum, it is my personal opinion that they will move out from Kherson city area, BEFORE they withdraw from areas near the dam. As for the dam area itself: they will delay there as long as possible, while they continue building Krim defenses - as they already do in Chaplynka. Also, they will continue reinforcing existing Vasylivka - Pology - Tokmak triangle.

Not that its come to that of course.\n\nWhere it gets interesting tho is in everything else. While the situation west of the river may not be extreme or critical, there are still tons of things that need to come across. Sure you have food and ammo, but if your tank cracks a transmission gear can you get another one across? Or if your BMP breaks a track link, are there enough in the supply depot? Your BRDM bursts a 14.5mm barrel, is there a new one or have you just become a jeep? This kind of stuff isn't at the forefront of most people's thinking, but is the kind of stuff that can win or lose battles. Sure you need ammo, but you also need oil filters, and firing pins, and a million other stupid little things. But it adds up. Which is way war is often not a fencing bout but a wrestling match. Its about relative advantage. \n\nOf course this is less sexy for us on the Reddit front, and is a lot harder to target for Ukrainian planners. It very much akin to the ball bearing mania which infected USAAF in 1942&43.",

Except for the fact that such a route would go right through an active battlefield, filled with mines, defensive positions, home to a major offensive since late August. And that there is no visual proof. Nor any press releases from Ukraine stating it exists, despite every reason possible to let the world know they're feeding their starving people in Kherson neglected by the Russians. While there are reports it doesn't exist because the Russians refused creating one, multiple times when the UA asked them to open a green corridor since March and then again in June..\n\n>Just because there isn't visual evidence at the moment doesn't mean it's not happening.\n\nThere is NO evidence of any kind. You might as well suggest they're teleporting supplies in. \n\nWhat there is evidence of is reports of various aid agencies dropping supplies off coming from the east across the Dnieper, which just so happens to coincide with the legit Russian military supply lines we all know exists.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/wTej48KE1bc/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nWhat's that I see?

Except for the fact that such a route would go right through an active battlefield, filled with mines, defensive positions, home to a major offensive since late August. And that there is no visual proof. Nor any press releases from Ukraine stating it exists, despite every reason possible to let the world know they&#39;re feeding their starving people in Kherson neglected by the Russians. While there are reports it doesn&#39;t exist because the Russians refused creating one, multiple times when the UA asked them to open a green corridor since March and then again in June..</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just because there isn&#39;t visual evidence at the moment doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not happening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is NO evidence of any kind. You might as well suggest they&#39;re teleporting supplies in. </p>\n\n<p>What there is evidence of is reports of various aid agencies dropping supplies off coming from the east across the Dnieper, which just so happens to coincide with the legit Russian military supply lines we all know exists.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wTej48KE1bc/maxresdefault.jpg\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wTej48KE1bc/maxresdefault.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s that I see?

We will never see another bomber designed like the B-17, and nothing even like the B-52 **as it was originally built.** Through the 1970s the B-52s biggest defense was via jamming, and while thats still important its just not enough in an airspace with an S-300 or -400 type system. \n\nThat being said there is a reason why the USAF is investing in the B21 and its not because LocMart tickles their pickle in just the right way. Bombers need to assume theyll be operating in contested airspace and have to be designed from the ground up to handle that. Stealth is the number one driver of this requirement, and both the B2 and B21 are very viable platforms. IIRC B2s have never been lost to enemy fire (both the B-52 and F-117 have) and its my impression that even on the B2 its stealth is very much still viable. Also worth keeping in mind tho that the B2's mission is not level carpet bombing. Overwhelmingly it is instead a platform from which cruise missiles can be launched. Its one thing to shoot of ATCAMs from a truck somewhere east of Kyiv. Its a whole other thing to take a bomber off from a base in Louisiana, fly halfway around the world, and then launch a low observability missile onto a target. Or drop a nuke on it, whatever fits your flavor. This is the B2s job, to fly into an unprepared and defended airspace and drop a mission critical weapon onto a strategically significant target with a high likelihood of success. The B-52 cant do that anymore, but other platforms can. \n\nThats not the say the B-52 will go away. Surely it will, and probably one day soon. Its an old design. But it also has advantages. Its a *great* JDAM dropper. People like to jerk off about the A-10 as a bomb truck, or that really some other kind of low tech Skyraider solution would be better. But the B-52 is the king of 'fuck that gridsquare and everyone in it.' It may not be viable in a peer-to-peer conflict, but against someone like Iraq or Iran the B-52 definitely has a role as 'pain train.' Pair one or two up with an SOF squad and a laser designator and watch as enemy brigades simply disappear. And of course the B-52 can deploy almost every weapon the B-2 can, making it as good a cruise missile platform. And again, one with a globe spanning reach there is literally nowhere the B-52 cannot go. While AD is a bigger problem, the B-52 has always had state of the art jamming, so while it probably wont be dropping freefall bombs onto S-300 radars, it would still be a viable platform in striking targets in the middle and periphery of an AD net. If the B2 is all about strategic targets, the B-52 is about tactical domination. Its the USAF's true answer to large scale bombing. \n\nI do think though the B1, ill fated as its always been, is destined for the chopping block. Its just never been what it needed to be, and speed (while useful) has never been as valuable as stealth. I've read about ways to pair the B1 with F-22s and AWACS to create a sort of AAMRAM truck with the B1, and its interesting stuff. Use a data link with an F-22 to identify A2A targets, then use the B1 with a belly full of AAMRAMs to actually engage, thus preserving the F-22s stealth. But probably that would need to be a feature worked out with the AIM-210, as I think the AIM-120 neither has this datalink feature nor has the range to make this idea a reality. MAR at altitude of an AIM-120 is, like, 20nmi? Less than 10 on the deck? And the missile still needs to go pitbull for terminal guidance, so the defender gets warning. IDK, I just dont see the need for what the B1 can do at this point.",

Why do any of this when you can build UAV wingmen with either the radars or the missiles and just have them fly preset patterns with the host plane? IMO thats the real future of A2A.</p>\n</div>",

The IRGC hasn't even started to mobilize to quell the protests, and an overwhelming majority of Iranians, even if they do agree with the protests, is still sitting out.\n\nIt's always the same thing unfortunately. The western media goes into an insane frenzy whenever there is a 'pro democracy movement'.

If we\u2019re talking about flying the flag or parking an aircraft carrier in uncontested waters for flight ops and land support, Navy has no equals. \n\nIf we\u2019re talking about Navy engaging enemy ships and fleets in blue waters beyond land based aircraft and missile umbrellas to achieve sea superiority, I think Navy still has no equals and is very strong. \n\nDoing the same job within enemy aircraft and missile range, I think Navy has some real challenges that it faces. Not that Navy can\u2019t succeed at these missions, but that it would have difficulty doing so, and would have difficult recovering for the next such contested mission (more on that in a moment). \n\nIn heavily contested littoral waters, I think Navy may very well have to cede the battle space. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about Navy\u2019s two missions that it seems to ignore, but are critical to US defense: convey duty and support for landing on contested shores. Convey duty - there\u2019s absolutely no evidence Navy is either orienting itself or practicing convoy duty. And make no mistake, in the event of a Western Pac or NATO/Rus conflict, Navy will be asked to protect convoys sailing across the Pacific or Atlantic. Against Rus/Chi, I\u2019d rate the Navy as weak on this point. \n\nContested shore landings: part of the new USMC model appears to abandon contested shore landings in favor of uncontested landings. It\u2019s why the USMC is focusing on a lighter infantry model with longer range fires. But at the end of the day, the only way to hold land is to send in the infantry and armor. Sea and air power isn\u2019t enough. But maybe Army and Marine airborne is a part of this plan. \n\nFinally, let\u2019s get down to fundamentals; amateurs talk tactics while professionals talk logistics. Navy has some real logistics problems. Not enough shipyards, shipyards aren\u2019t big enough, not modern enough. We\u2019re upgrading them, but really, we should have another 2-3 shipyards per coast. \n\nWhile we have enough replenishment ships for peacetime, I don\u2019t think we have enough for wartime. And almost certainly not enough to run resupply ships at sea subject to hostile submarine hunters and/or hostile aircraft. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s significant concern about Navy skills. Reference the Fitz, McCain, and Bonnie Dick incidents. Of particular concern is damage control; good damage control is the difference between the Yorktown and the Bonnie Dick (maybe the Lexington too, but if the ship is too damaged, no amount of damage control will help. Fun fact, the Yorktown\u2019s successor, CV-10, was originally named the Bonhomme Richard); bad damage control will kill ships prematurely. Whether Navy is training its sailors well enough to fight - and I mean the essential divisions to a ship - is a question very much in doubt.",
