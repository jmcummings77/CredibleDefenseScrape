      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

From conversations I've had with some friends I have from the left, they don't believe most of the nonsense about this being Ben Gvir's private army either.\n\nIs it really hard to imagine reasonable opposition to the creation of a separate military force with a separate chain of command? What, would you say, is the purpose of creating a separate force here that will draw from already established forces with well defined responsibilities? Can you answer that same question from the perspective of a more secular Israeli who sees the military as largely secular and Ben-Gvir as totally non-secular? Honestly, do you think right-wing politicians like Ben-Gvir see the IDF and courts as aligned with them politically or socially? \n\n> ultimately stated hope that it will succeed and bring the violence and crime down.\n\nAgain, why wouldn't an expansion of the police accomplish this? Why do the obviously inefficient approach of establishing a new force that leeches strength from the old? If there were extra bodies, then wouldn't the Israeli Guard have succeeded in recruiting them already given, as you pointed out, that a very similar proposal was already in place when Ben-Gvir came into power? If there are enough bodies to support a separate force, why draw from Border Guard and reservists? If there are not enough bodies, then why introduce the inefficiency of parallel command structures? Why introduce the inefficiency of separate training programs or logistics? if they're not to be separated, then why aren't we just talking about an expansion of the IDF and Border guard? Can you see why some folks might look at this situation and wonder what the actual underlying motivations are given that, facially, this appears to be inefficient use of scare resources in a setting where Israel can hardly afford to show weakness? \n\nBasically, I'm trying to get you to acknowledge the other side of the argument here which seems to me to be: **the right-wing are attacking the institutions that stand in their way: the judiciary and the IDF**. Engage with THAT rather than position this as Ben-Gvir establishing a \"personal military.\" The steelman other side of this is it's not a personal military, it's a right-wing controlled military to counter-balance the secular IDF. Practically speaking, that might just mean in the near term that Ben-Gvir can set a policy the IDF would never support vis-a-vis the treatment of Palestinians, and eventually, Israeli dissidents. In that regard, the IRGC comparison makes a TON of sense as it was a military force created by khomeini because the Iranian military was seen as loyal to the previous regime (and secular vs religious!). The comparison being that you have a right-wing government that has a military which leans toward the secular position aka new regime with a military seen as loyal to something else. Now, obviously there's a huge difference in that the IRGC started as and has grown more and more personally loyal rather than loyal to \"the new regime,\" but nevertheless ... political leadership looking to establish military force more aligned with their politics in a country with a pre-existing functional military aligned with a different political outlook is very much a legit comparison here. If you cannot acknowledge that and confront the idea honestly, then you're going to get the reaction you've been getting around here: rejection for partisan motivated reasoning / inflexibility of thought / lack of respect for the other position. \n\nCan you see why a reasonable person might see this is as right-wing attempting to counter-balance what they see as a secular IDF? Can you see why, from that perspective, there's a legit comparison to the IRGC and why IT was created? Does the creation of separate force structures with separate command increase or decrease the odds of internal Israeli on Israeli violence?\n\nI'd also like to just add, you are the only person in this thread that brought up Hitler AFAIK.

What, would you say, is the purpose of creating a separate force here that will draw from already established forces with well defined responsibilities? Can you answer that same question from the perspective of a more secular Israeli who sees the military as largely secular and Ben-Gvir as totally non-secular? Honestly, do you think right-wing politicians like Ben-Gvir see the IDF and courts as aligned with them politically or socially? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ultimately stated hope that it will succeed and bring the violence and crime down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, why wouldn&#39;t an expansion of the police accomplish this? Why do the obviously inefficient approach of establishing a new force that leeches strength from the old? If there were extra bodies, then wouldn&#39;t the Israeli Guard have succeeded in recruiting them already given, as you pointed out, that a very similar proposal was already in place when Ben-Gvir came into power? If there are enough bodies to support a separate force, why draw from Border Guard and reservists? If there are not enough bodies, then why introduce the inefficiency of parallel command structures? Why introduce the inefficiency of separate training programs or logistics? if they&#39;re not to be separated, then why aren&#39;t we just talking about an expansion of the IDF and Border guard? Can you see why some folks might look at this situation and wonder what the actual underlying motivations are given that, facially, this appears to be inefficient use of scare resources in a setting where Israel can hardly afford to show weakness? </p>\n\n<p>Basically, I&#39;m trying to get you to acknowledge the other side of the argument here which seems to me to be: <strong>the right-wing are attacking the institutions that stand in their way: the judiciary and the IDF</strong>.

Demand for ammunition has surged thanks to the war in Ukraine, which is using about 6,000 rounds per day \u2014 equivalent to the annual orders from a small European country \u2014 and would like to fire 65,000 if it could, according to Nammo. Brandtz\u00e6g said demand for artillery rounds was more than 15 times higher than normal.

I can\u2019t rule it out.\u201d** TikTok declined to comment. **Elvia, the local energy company, confirmed that the electricity network had no spare capacity after promising it to the data centre as it allocates it on a first come, first served basis. \u201cIf Nammo orders capacity, depending on how much it needs, it will take time before there is available capacity as the transmission network needs to be strengthened,\u201d Elvia said.**\n\nExperts say fights over which companies and which type of industry get priority access to electricity grids are likely to increase across Europe.

It gets fixed within a couple of years by the grid operator but slows down the permits for new generation or load. For example Finland's Ostrobothnian region will not grant new permits for wind turbines for a couple years (even though it's growing like crazy and has become insanely profitable for the local municipalities) because they need to build up the transmission capacity to the rest of the country first.\n\nObviously with nuclear power plants and other megaprojects, these increases get planned by the local authorities as a part of the permit process, so it doesn't pose an obstacle but additional costs to price in. For smaller/more spontaneous demand there's more friction from this. (I've worked on the field)",

For example Finland&#39;s Ostrobothnian region will not grant new permits for wind turbines for a couple years (even though it&#39;s growing like crazy and has become insanely profitable for the local municipalities) because they need to build up the transmission capacity to the rest of the country first.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously with nuclear power plants and other megaprojects, these increases get planned by the local authorities as a part of the permit process, so it doesn&#39;t pose an obstacle but additional costs to price in. For smaller/more spontaneous demand there&#39;s more friction from this. (I&#39;ve worked on the field)</p>\n</div>",

If RuAF were 3 times larger compared to UAF, then a loss ratio of 3:1, for example, wouldn't be so problematic for russia.

Ukraine fields some TDF units into bakhmut, along with others regular forces (some airborne units, some infantry, one mechanized, IIRC), while russia deployed the infamous wagner mobiks + wagner \"regulars\", along with several VDV units and donbas republics' units.\n\nCertainly what you say could be a possibility, but as far as I can tell there's no proof russians aren't loosing valuable troops too (and probably they are).

Here's my proposal.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CommandoDude/status/1640459199254777856\n\nDate: Late May\n\nDirection: Berdiansk\n\nObjective: Take Polohy. Create 30km salient deep into Russian lines.\n\nExecution: Two of Ukraine's newly formed Mech corps + Some local forces.

            "body": "A bit late to the party with this, but wanted to share my thoughts on this. Though it's obviously might come off as a little bit of an armchair general, as I'm not really an expert in these sorts of things.\n\nWhen talking about Southern counter-offensive, people generally mention that Zaporizhzhya oblast is sort of a flatland and while it's 70% true, there's a significant elevation on it's eastern border with Donetsk oblast, biggest settlements there being Bilmak (Kamyanka before it was renamed) to the west, closer to Polohy and Rozivka to the east, closer to Mariupol. Just a bit west of Bilmak there's Trudove village and right beside it the highest point of the whole Southern Ukraine in Belmak-Mohyla (324 meters above sea level).\n\nNow I've seen people mention Rozivka a few times, but generally no one talks about these elevations specifically and I'm curious why. I'm originally from Zaporizhzhya, I've been to Belmak-Mohyla, you get a good view from there, so I think it would make sense to try to get to this place, before going for Polohy. Not sure if I'm tactically overlooking something here or it's just that people are not familiar with geography of this place.\n\nAlso, if you look at the russian fortifications map linked in the comment below, you can see that from ukrainian held Huliaipole to occupied Rozivka there's a bit of a gap in these fortifications. Now, Bilmak is kind of reinforced according to this map (though the road to Bilmak is relatively clear), but Rozivka isn't, which makes it a good intermediate goal, considering it's just about in the middle between the Azov sea and current Ukrainian positions, is relatively close to Mariupol, and is on the heights.\n\nSo I personally would try for Huliaipole->Bilmak and Velyka Novosilka->Rozivka directions with some sort of a supportive efforts in-between these 2 directions (which can turn to main effort to Rozivka instead, if Velyka Novosilka-Rozivka is heavily reinforced) and maybe some tying action in Polohy and Vuhledar to protect the flanks. The date would be whenever they're ready, hopefully before the end of June, preferably early April-early May I guess, that's when it should be getting consistently warm.\n\nThe pros would be: 1) Less fortifications here and I would say 2) Russians most likely would expect attack at Polohy, so I believe you can accumulate resources here and still have the surprise effect of attacking basically around it; 3) Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you'd need less tanks for this, since there's no heavy defenses you need to overwhelm really. IFVs would be beneficial for mobility, though\n\nThe cons would be: 1) the fact that the roads are not optimal there and go mainly beside the small rivers, meaning that your flanks will have the high ground; 2) while west part of Zaporizhzhya oblast is relatively undermanned, we'd definitely have more Russian troops east and north-east of Rozivka, as they are constantly accumulating forces for Vuhledar attacks here, meaning that rapid breakthrough is needed here or these positions will be reinforced pretty quickly.\n\nThe main reward for this direction would obviously be: 1) the high ground. If you take Bilmak the elevation difference with Polohy is like 200-250m, and you directly threaten its flank, so I see it very likely that Russians withdraw at least from Polohy if you can hold this highground; 2.A) Also the wedge in this place gives you opportunities to outflank all russian fortifications in west of Zaporizhzhya oblast up to Tokmak-Melitopol line; 2.B) In the east you can threaten to outflank Russian positions and fortifications in Volnovakha, which is another important elevation (the most important, I'd argue)  3.A) Last but not least, you cut off Volnovakha-Melitopol railway line, not sure if Russians repaired Donetsk-Volnovakha railway, but if they did and supply their Southern group with that, well then you cut it off and if Crimean railway bridge is still inoperable at that time, then this Southern group is left with no railway supply lines at all. 3.B) You get within ~35km to M14 highway, not sure if that guarantees fire control over it, but surely it will be tougher for Russians to supply their Southern group by road as well.\n\nThe main risk here that I fear is that if you fail, you bring attention to this spot and Russians will reinforce it, it will only be harder after that. That, and obviously just waste of resources in case of a failure.\n\nAs for execution, I think it should be akin to UAF's run to Kupyansk last September. Just try to get closer to Bilmak\\Rozivka as fast as you can, leaving blocking forces if there's any resistance in settlements along the road. Now, I know that happened because Russians were undermanned there, but I do believe that you can find similar gaps in these small settlements in the Southern direction. Important thing here would be doing that before Russians reinforce these positions from Volnovakha, which is pretty close.",

Now, Bilmak is kind of reinforced according to this map (though the road to Bilmak is relatively clear), but Rozivka isn&#39;t, which makes it a good intermediate goal, considering it&#39;s just about in the middle between the Azov sea and current Ukrainian positions, is relatively close to Mariupol, and is on the heights.</p>\n\n<p>So I personally would try for Huliaipole-&gt;Bilmak and Velyka Novosilka-&gt;Rozivka directions with some sort of a supportive efforts in-between these 2 directions (which can turn to main effort to Rozivka instead, if Velyka Novosilka-Rozivka is heavily reinforced) and maybe some tying action in Polohy and Vuhledar to protect the flanks. The date would be whenever they&#39;re ready, hopefully before the end of June, preferably early April-early May I guess, that&#39;s when it should be getting consistently warm.</p>\n\n<p>The pros would be: 1) Less fortifications here and I would say 2) Russians most likely would expect attack at Polohy, so I believe you can accumulate resources here and still have the surprise effect of attacking basically around it; 3) Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I think you&#39;d need less tanks for this, since there&#39;s no heavy defenses you need to overwhelm really. IFVs would be beneficial for mobility, though</p>\n\n<p>The cons would be: 1) the fact that the roads are not optimal there and go mainly beside the small rivers, meaning that your flanks will have the high ground; 2) while west part of Zaporizhzhya oblast is relatively undermanned, we&#39;d definitely have more Russian troops east and north-east of Rozivka, as they are constantly accumulating forces for Vuhledar attacks here, meaning that rapid breakthrough is needed here or these positions will be reinforced pretty quickly.</p>\n\n<p>The main reward for this direction would obviously be: 1) the high ground. If you take Bilmak the elevation difference with Polohy is like 200-250m, and you directly threaten its flank, so I see it very likely that Russians withdraw at least from Polohy if you can hold this highground; 2.A) Also the wedge in this place gives you opportunities to outflank all russian fortifications in west of Zaporizhzhya oblast up to Tokmak-Melitopol line; 2.B) In the east you can threaten to outflank Russian positions and fortifications in Volnovakha, which is another important elevation (the most important, I&#39;d argue)  3.A) Last but not least, you cut off Volnovakha-Melitopol railway line, not sure if Russians repaired Donetsk-Volnovakha railway, but if they did and supply their Southern group with that, well then you cut it off and if Crimean railway bridge is still inoperable at that time, then this Southern group is left with no railway supply lines at all. 3.B) You get within ~35km to M14 highway, not sure if that guarantees fire control over it, but surely it will be tougher for Russians to supply their Southern group by road as well.</p>\n\n<p>The main risk here that I fear is that if you fail, you bring attention to this spot and Russians will reinforce it, it will only be harder after that. That, and obviously just waste of resources in case of a failure.</p>\n\n<p>As for execution, I think it should be akin to UAF&#39;s run to Kupyansk last September. Just try to get closer to Bilmak\\Rozivka as fast as you can, leaving blocking forces if there&#39;s any resistance in settlements along the road. Now, I know that happened because Russians were undermanned there, but I do believe that you can find similar gaps in these small settlements in the Southern direction. Important thing here would be doing that before Russians reinforce these positions from Volnovakha, which is pretty close.</p>\n</div>",

The EU certainly doesn&#39;t, they are in fact the biggest trade partner with Assad&#39;s Syria. </p>\n\n<p>All this to say, Assad&#39;s government is for all intents and purposes the internationally recognized legitimate government of Syria, and that him inviting Iran to operate there is perfectly genuine legal pretext. The US view of the situation is the <em>outlier</em> here, not the norm. </p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of other examples. China does bad things to their citizens too, but everyone recognizes the CCP as the legitimate government.</p>\n</div>",
