As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Not all of the mobilized formations currently deployed to the front are suffering from the most extreme cases of undersupply we've seen, like entire battalions deploying without weapons as was reported occasionally during the first days of the Russian mobilization in the fall. Immediately following the announcement of the mobilization, 150k mobilized personnel were directly committed to the front to stabilize it after the Kharkiv counteroffensive and to buy time for training and equipping the remaining 150k personnel mobilized in the same wave. Those thrown directly into combat received both grossly inadequate training *and* grossly inadequate equipment, whereas the second wave received slightly better but still grossly inadequate training and some amount of reasonable quality equipment, which may or may not have been adequate if employed by a sufficiently competent force. But they seem to have lacked such a force, so it is difficult to assess whether they lacked appropriate equipment entirely or were simply too incompetent to make good use of it, or both. \n\nYou can infer the general lack of quality from the performance of the formations that attacked Vuhledar and lost 130 or so armored vehicles of various types in a single attack. That suggests they were reasonably well-equipped by Russian standards but quite remarkably incompetent in making use of their equipment. The Vuhledar attack and other similar attacks over the past three months were the best offensives the Russians could muster with all 300k mobilized personnel and the cream of the crop of their remaining reserves of MBTs and IFVs, plus whatever other formations they have had committed to the front during the same period. They have clearly run out of such formations (i.e., mobilized personnel with bad training but some amount of decent kit), which is why the have stopped attempting large scale offensive maneuvers and are instead relying on Wagner-style small assault groups to make limited progress in heavily defended urban terrain around Bakhmut and Avdiivka. So you can bet that the bulk of the remaining mobilized personnel are even more poorly equipped or just as incompetent in making use of what equipment they do have as the doomed Vuhledar troops. \n\nBottom line, at a minimum, you should count the first batch of 150k mobilized personnel as press-ganged, low-quality formations likely to be equipped with a hodgepodge of outdated weaponry and equipment in varying states of decay. Plus any of the subsequent 150k mobilized that were well-equipped have likely been attrited during ill-advised mud season offensives around Svatove, Kreminna, Bakhmut, Advdiivka, and Vuhledar, so you wouldn't be taking a very extreme position by including the rest of those troops in your estimate.",

In the short term, I would say that they almost certainly will attempt such an attrition strategy for at least a brief period of shaping operations. That may be precisely what they are attempting in the south at this very moment, where there has been a definite uptick in Ukrainian strikes on critical Russian equipment and troop concentrations over the past couple of weeks. In theory, they could sit back and chip away at Russian supplies with long range fires until they force a retreat, much like how the Kherson offensive unfolded. Especially in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts where Russian supply lines are the longest and most vulnerable to interdiction by HIMARS, JDAMS, and GLSDBs.\n\nThat approach has the advantage of minimizing UAF casualties and the risk of a major defeat during an offensive, but at the cost of time that the Ukrainians may not be able to spare. An attrition strategy could be very, very slow, much like the Kherson offensive was when compared to the Kharkiv offensive, for example. The Ukrainians almost certainly feel an enormous amount of pressure to deliver immediate results with the newly donated western MBTs and IFVs to demonstrate their competence and invite further donations from the west. They are also keenly aware that western political support may fade at any time, and so they need to make progress on the ground immediately, otherwise they may have to negotiate a ceasefire that recognizes an unfavorable on-the-ground reality putting Russia in long-term control of much or all of currently occupied Ukraine. \n\nLastly, the UAF may assess that the Russians are particularly vulnerable to counteroffensive right now, because they have expended all of their combat ready reserves in their various winter offensives and have not mobilized additional personnel to replenish those reserves. Which suggests a more aggressive course of action may be appropriate, in order to exploit the temporary deficit in Russian combat power. \n\nUltimately, we won't know until the mud season has been over for a few weeks.

So if in May, the Ukrainians are still pounding the Russians with long range fires but have not made any on-the-ground offensive moves, it'll start to look more like they are pursuing exactly the sort of attrition strategy you propose. If instead we see them start pushing Russian lines with probing attacks at the same time, it will be difficult to know whether those attacks are just routine spoiling attacks during a period of intentional attrition, or if they are intended to identify an opportunity for full blown armored breaching assaults on Russian fortified positions.

I don't think the Russians would have withdrawn completely from that bank of the river if they weren't also experiencing extreme supply difficulties due to the repeated HIMARS attacks on the various crossings. \n\nThey could have consolidated their lines by retreating to better fortified positions closer to the river on the right bank around Kherson City and opposite Nova Kakhovka in the urbanized areas between Kozatske and Beryslav, rather than fighting to hold the hinterlands around the city along the Inhulets to the northwest, open fields to the north, and a line roughly from Snihurivka south to the coast. Pulling back to the outskirts of the city itself and to a smaller pocket around the dam would have reduced the length of their lines and achieved that consolidation you describe, while still maintaining a foothold on the right bank that threatened Mykolaiv, Kherson City, and Kryvyi Rih, and thus forcing the Ukrainians to maintain a stronger holding force there compared to the relatively light forces they've been able to devote to holding the river bank itself after the full Russian withdrawal. \n\nIt would also have forced the Ukrainians to choose between potentially ruining Kherson City with vicious urban battles and allowing the Russians to maintain their positions there. Lastly, it would have brought the line of contact into easy range of their artillery on the left/east bank of the Dnipro, which would have dramatically reduced the quantity of materiel they needed to supply across the river while still maintaining the same powerful artillery umbrella that helped slow down the UAF counteroffensive for so many months. \n\nMeaning, in the absence of the supply constraints caused by the Ukrainian interdiction of the Dnipro crossings, the Russians likely would not have withdrawn all the way across the river in one go, even if they wanted to redirect troops to stabilize the lines elsewhere, simply because they would have fixed a greater number of Ukrainian troops in Kherson than the same Russian troops would be able to counter in the east.",

I can image the likes of Poland sticking to Ukraine pretty much indefinitely, but the US., France, UK, and Germany are far more uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>Realistically, support will gradually wear off the longer a stalemate lasts, espescially so if the more modern equipment that is now arriving accomplishes nothing except turning to wrecks in a war of attrition. Time is not on their side, they need results.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "> I\u2019ve felt for a while that the UA\u2019s organization is more of a limitation then a strength. But I also get why it is the way it is.\n\nThey've definitely had to make do with ad hoc organizations that are far from ideal. I think there's pretty widespread agreement that there needs to be some intermediate larger unit between brigade and the general staff, and there has been from the beginning. So there's some ideal end state that's pretty widely agreed upon, but the difficult question is when to make a transition toward that type of structure. Obviously that wasn't going to be possible during the chaos of the first year of the war. Zaluzhny has spoken widely about his desire to form multiple offensive army corps, which I would expect to have their own central command staff separate from the tactical formations. So it's possible they are already adding in that command layer to the units which have been held in reserve for training and preparation for the counteroffensive, while they are holding back on reworking the command structure for the frontline defensive units until a more convenient time (e.g., when the Russians are on the defensive). \n\nI know I often sound like a Ukrainian apologist, but the timing makes a lot of sense here. The UAF has tripled in size since last year, before which time the ground forces and their logistics footprints were small enough to rely exclusively on brigade level formations in the JFO. The first four months of the war were \"anything goes\" in a desperate attempt to stabilize the front, so getting warm bodies with weapons into units was more important than following a strict command structure. Especially because the Ukrainians relied so heavily on \"bottoms-up\" coordination, with civilians and civil society organizations stepping in to provide services that more typically are provided by the government or the military's professional staff and logistics train (e.g., medics, med evac, crowd-sourced supplies, civilian resistance ISR, etc.). So there just wasn't time or sufficient need to reorganize at the division/corps/army level. At least not until HIMARS hit the scene and stopped Russian artillery-based progress in its tracks back in June.\n\nThen there were two relatively quiet months (where the Russians made extremely slow but costly progress and the Ukrainians were able to regroup for offensives a little, but just barely, with little training and little western armor or equipment to give them a qualitative edge over the Russians. These quiet months ended with the successful counteroffensives in Kherson and Kharkiv, which notably lacked any super-brigade-level combined arms maneuvers (at least that were successful). The closest thing would be the Kharkiv offensive, but in that case they organized by pulling battalion-sized units off the lines during their regular rotations on the sly, rather than organizing at the brigade level, never mind the division or above levels. In Kherson, nearly all of their assaults on Russian fortifications ended poorly, regardless of echelonment, and ultimately it was supply interdiction with the superior range/precision of HIMARS that made the Russians retreat. None of which required super-brigade-level coordination.\n\nIt's only been the last five months or so that the Ukrainians have started to muster brigade-level formations in quantity that are sufficiently competent in modern warfare techniques to participate in division or army-level combined arms maneuvers. So if you're in command of the UAF at this point, now that the time seems appropriate, where would you start introducing this new layer of command? Seems logical to start with the offensive reserves, since they will be required to conduct the most challenging and complex operations and are already undergoing extensive training and re-equipment with western arms. And, if successful, those formations will need to plan and maintain their own supply chain while on the move and while remaining flexible both to their rear area resource limitations and to their frontline tactical needs. i.e., they will require their own planning staff to coordinate across tactical units like brigades.\n\nThen, once the offensives culminate (whether by succeeding, stalling, or failing), and the Ukrainians shift into a defensive posture, they will have an opportunity to assess whether the new command structure for the offensive worked or needs to be changed. They can then apply those lessons learned to standardizing the command structures among the units retained for defensive purposes, either when those units are rotated out of combat or during any extended Russian operational pause that reduces pressure on the front. \n\nSo I'd say that Tatarigami's points are all extremely pertinent critiques of the current state of the UAF, but I hope I'm right that the UAF leadership recognize and are addressing those issues. Either way, I'm pretty sure it's going to take a while to make those changes universal across the entirety of the Ukrainian ground forces, and as evidence that Ukraine is moving in the right direction, I would look for limited test cases where the UAF sticks its toe in the water by organizing larger echelons for limited purposes (like offensives, or maybe high priority defensive regions like Bakhmut if offensives don't materialize) before it tries to apply that structure across their entire military. It's worth remembering that reorganizing a military while it is literally engaged in a life or death struggle is a dangerous task, and one best undertaken with caution and intentionality.",

If this was a wunderwaffen that could reliably snipe MiGs without warning (instead of giving them a beep that forces them to evade & suppresses their sortie but rarely kills them, which is what all of their reports seem to say), Ukraine would have run out of fighters within the first month of their use. You can't simultaneously have a super effective impossible to evade long range missile, fire several of them every day for five months, and fail to destroy an enemy air force with likely fewer than fifty fixed wing aircraft.

There are barely any publicly available pictures of F-35s using their external hardpoints at all, let alone RCS\nmeasurements.

We're talking about less than 24 hours between the start of the Syrian offensive till the Israeli reservists began arriving and slowing down the Syrian advance.\n\n**Less than 48 hours** till the Israeli forces began pushing the Syrian forces back.\n\nThe successful Israeli counter offensive began 1.5 days after the start of the war and the Syrian offensive.\n\nRemember that very little advances and general fighting happened at night due to poor ability of either side to operate in such conditions well. That is not to say no fighting happened, just comparatively little to the intensity of the day fighting. \n\nIn that time frame:\n\n1. The Syrian main effort in the north of the Golan heights failed to reach any breakthrough.\n2. The Syrian force in the south of the Golan heights was able to achieve breakthrough and advanced to the south and mid of the Golan heights.\n3. Israeli forces still remained scattered among the advancing Syrian forces, some Israeli strongholds were simply surrounded and for the time ignored.\n4. Reservist forces began to arrive at the southern tip of the southern Golan height stalling the Syrian advance there.\n5. The question asked is why didn't the Syrians advance in the middle of the south Golan heights to the west where they were virtually unopposed.\n\nThe answers are:\n\n1. Fog of war was heavy, and took it's toll on both sides. A lot of small Israeli forces were still scattered throughout the now the Syrian controlled southern Golan heights. Often themselves having little idea of how the war was going, with wounded, low on ammo, etc. That has added a lot to the general confusion.\n2. This is less than 24h since the break through, the Syrian armed thrust was outpacing the logistic train (and infantry which has began it's advance at about midday into Israel) and the bulk of the forces were just waiting for these elements to catch up.\n3. Many units have outpaced their orders. ie they were ordered to take objective X. took it with little or no opposition in the face of the hasty Israeli withdrawal from many command posts in the southern Golan and were just waiting for further orders.\n\n>They had some ways to go if they were ordered to stop on the river.\n\nThe Syrian advance was phased, the orders were not just go in a straight line till the Jordan river. Units that fulfilled their objective will stop and wait for further orders. Orders that many times were just to take a defensive stance and wait for logistics/infantry to catch up, or stop and do recon in force.\n\n>They barely advanced 20 km at most, there is zero evidence that they outpaced their logistics.\n\nIn about 30 hours. They haven't just outpaced their logistics train, they outpaced their infantry.\n\nWhat do you mean zero evidence they outpaced their logistics, do you think logistic trucks were taking part in the battle for Nafah for instance? fought late in their 24h advance (about exactly 24h after the start of the assault)? \n\nDo you think that armor formation that have spent an entire day literally fighting and driving do not need logistics support in terms of shells and gas?",
