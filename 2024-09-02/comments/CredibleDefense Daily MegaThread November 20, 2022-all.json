Some quick background.\n\nThe M270 was developed to deliver just one thing, a type of cluster munition called the dual-purpose improved conventional munition (DPICM). This is a small shaped charge capable of defeating most roof amour of a typical AFV, sans ERA. Surrounding the shaped charge is a steel casing designed to fragment to provide a anti-personal effect. DPICMs were delivered in the past via aerial bombs, 105mm, 155mm, 203mm artillery, man portable weapons, and the unguided M26 rocket for the M270. Cluster munitions are bad, the DPICM especially so, and I'm just gonna leave it at that.\n\nSo the only unguided round developed for the MLRS Family Of Munition(MFOM), used by the M270 MLRS and M142 HIMARS is the M26 series, carrying 644 DPICMs each(518 in the M26A1/A2). There was a program to convert existing M26 rockets to carry the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), which would be a guided munition. I don't believe that program went anywhere. \n\nThe M30 missile(officially \"rocket\") added further range and GPS terminal guidance as inertia guidance becomes less accurate over distance, carrying 404 DPICMs. Being cluster munitions are politically nonviable the M31 series was developed, carrying a unitary warhead. Unitary meaning it can be used for hard targets with the fuzing set for impact, or as a anti-personal munition with the fuzing set for air-burst. Around the same time the Alternative Warhead(AW) program was started to replace the M30 rocket's DPICMs with something of similar effect leading to the M30A1. The M30A2 is the same thing but complies with the US military's insensitive munitions program, as in the rocket motor is less likely to detonate if exposed to high temperatures and/or excessive shock.  As for how capable the Alternative Warhead(M30A1/A2) is, nobody knows. There is only public data on funding and design goals, not actual testing as far as I'm aware of.",

So consider the following paragraphs more as a speculative exercise than any sort of actual definitive answer. \n\nIt has been an absolutely atrocious year on the supply side just in general. Semiconductors have been in a shortage for 2 years now, with many experts expecting them to go into 2023. The global nexus for industry, China, has slowed down its demand for raw materials and output of processed goods. Part of this is intense lockdowns due to \u201cCOVID-Zero\u201d policy, part is a slow motion implosion of their housing sector, the full size and implications of which are still unknown. Simultaneously, many of the most agriculturally productive regions on the planet has been hit by some sort of disaster. The Midwest, Germany, and Northern China were all flooded. Ukrainian grain has been seriously diminished by the war. The worst droughts in living memory are hitting Africa sparking famine across the continent. Similar drought conditions in the American Southwest are provoking a serious water crisis. Across the world, the supply of every category of goods is being affected negatively in some way.\n\nSimultaneously, there\u2019s the huge quantities of stimulus that were pumped into the demand side of the economy as a result of COVID. As people headed into lockdowns in 2020, governments anticipated a massive falloff in consumption and a resulting recession. To forestall this, they poured massive amounts of stimulus into their National economies. In hindsight, it\u2019s clear that that expected falloff in demand never happened. Consumer habits shifted drastically, but did not fall off overall. Instead, those massive quantities of stimulus supercharged an already red hot economy. Consumers looked to offload their windfall into assets and goods, spiking demand. Think about how insane the housing, stock, and crypto markets were. A lot of that was stimulus flowing into whatever equity it could find.\n\nSo, in sum, we have a situation where demand is increasing and supply is decreasing. It\u2019s economics 101: prices go up. For you and I, living in 1st world countries, that means pain at the pump, at the store, and at the realtors office. For poorer countries, though, it means that they can no longer afford the basic things they need to survive. And when people can no longer afford to survive, that\u2019s a recipe for political upheaval. Sri Lanka\u2019s case is a particularly clear example of this, thanks to political incompetence, but the same dynamics are at work across the planet. When things are getting worse, governments respond by trying to focus attention on an external enemy. The best way to do that, in turn, is with aggressive rhetoric and action.

But what's more concerning is what we don't know-unknown facts: 1) **unknown fact 1:** did those on the ground make any movement suggesting they would assist/ take advantage of the likely act of perfidy? 2)**unknown fact 2:** Were they killed simultaneously/near-simultaneously as when the act of perfidy was performed or after the Russian soldier who shot at the Ukrainians had been killed? **unknown fact 3:** Were any Ukrainians killed or wounded as a result?\n\nIn US courts there are different standards for 'burden of proof'-from beyond a reasonable doubt (strictest\\\\) to ''preponderance of the evidence' (least strict: essentially, 'more likely than not').These are not the rules that would apply but are a helpful conceptual guide, at least to me.\n\nGiven what we know, I would say that **we simply do not have enough information to know by any standard if the POWs on the ground made any movement during or after the act of perfidy or whether any Ukrainians were killed, but that it is 'more likely than not' (but not to the level of 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that they were killed after the soldier committing the act of perfidy was killed.** The reasons I reach this conclusion is that they are essentially in the same position as before (excepting the one body that is separate from the group, which raises its own questions). So if they had all been shot down while making a run for it, it'd be very unlikely that they would almost all be in their original positions-the Ukrainians did not seem to possess any weapons capable of mowing down 10 men in a split-second without most of them having been able to scramble off in some direction at least a few feet (though the presence of that one outlier body is puzzling). The second is that almost all of the wounds seem to be headshots. There are almost no entry-exit wounds on any of their bodies. This is indicative of a controlled shooting, not a spray of bullets in the heat of battle.\n\nTherefore, did the Ukrainian soldiers violate the 'hors de combat' rule? I think we can't say. But I think **we certainly cannot  (though perhaps reasonable minds can differ) rule out the fact that this very possibly was a post-combat execution. In conclusion, we have one clear war crime by the deceased Russian gunman by near absolute proof, and at least not completely disposable evidence, but not proof, of a war crime by the Ukrainian captors.**",

But what&#39;s more concerning is what we don&#39;t know-unknown facts: 1) <strong>unknown fact 1:</strong> did those on the ground make any movement suggesting they would assist/ take advantage of the likely act of perfidy? 2)<strong>unknown fact 2:</strong> Were they killed simultaneously/near-simultaneously as when the act of perfidy was performed or after the Russian soldier who shot at the Ukrainians had been killed? <strong>unknown fact 3:</strong> Were any Ukrainians killed or wounded as a result?</p>\n\n<p>In US courts there are different standards for &#39;burden of proof&#39;-from beyond a reasonable doubt (strictest\\) to &#39;&#39;preponderance of the evidence&#39; (least strict: essentially, &#39;more likely than not&#39;).These are not the rules that would apply but are a helpful conceptual guide, at least to me.</p>\n\n<p>Given what we know, I would say that <strong>we simply do not have enough information to know by any standard if the POWs on the ground made any movement during or after the act of perfidy or whether any Ukrainians were killed, but that it is &#39;more likely than not&#39; (but not to the level of &#39;beyond a reasonable doubt&#39; that they were killed after the soldier committing the act of perfidy was killed.</strong> The reasons I reach this conclusion is that they are essentially in the same position as before (excepting the one body that is separate from the group, which raises its own questions). So if they had all been shot down while making a run for it, it&#39;d be very unlikely that they would almost all be in their original positions-the Ukrainians did not seem to possess any weapons capable of mowing down 10 men in a split-second without most of them having been able to scramble off in some direction at least a few feet (though the presence of that one outlier body is puzzling). The second is that almost all of the wounds seem to be headshots. There are almost no entry-exit wounds on any of their bodies. This is indicative of a controlled shooting, not a spray of bullets in the heat of battle.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, did the Ukrainian soldiers violate the &#39;hors de combat&#39; rule? I think we can&#39;t say. But I think <strong>we certainly cannot  (though perhaps reasonable minds can differ) rule out the fact that this very possibly was a post-combat execution. In conclusion, we have one clear war crime by the deceased Russian gunman by near absolute proof, and at least not completely disposable evidence, but not proof, of a war crime by the Ukrainian captors.</strong></p>\n</div>",

Before February Ukraine never prevented anyone from leaving the country. You could even cross into LDPR or Crimea through the Ukrainian checkpoints. Your suggestion is for an exclusive Russian domestic policy. There is absolutely no reason to even ask Ukraine about its approval. \n\n\n>Russia should relocate them and provide for them\n\nThis suggestion of yours is a bit suspect. Are you suggesting that Ukraine officially let the Russian military in, for them to go around relocating random people?

What do you think his orders were during the surrender? Something like \"if anything funny happens, hose them all down\"? \n\nI ask because my first thought on seeing both videos was that he must have blasted everything and everyone the instant it went wrong. I was very confident in that guess until I started reading more commentary, and very few people seemed to be mentioning the guy with the LMG. It was all about whether or not the Ukrainians executed the Russians after \"the shooting stopped\", but I can't fathom a scenario in which there were any Russians alive after the shooting stopped if the LMG guy was doing his job. I'd also expect that the shooting lasted about the length of time it took for him to traverse every Russian with his gun, rather than some lengthy process where rational thought played a role. It would even explain the \"they all have head wounds\" observation, because his line of fire would be more or less directly at their heads. This seems really obvious, but the consensus hivemind comment doesn't agree with that hypothesis, so I'm probably missing something.\n\nAnyway, if someone who was ever actually behind a gun could chime in with the kind of orders and behaviors they'd expect to see in that scenario, thanks.",

They're necessary for European states, because no individual state really has the industrial base, military need, and political will to solely develop and produce a cutting-edge fighter jet - but they basically take all the usual problems with military procurement (political infighting, delays, cost-overruns, ever-changing specifications) and make them worse.\n\nJust look at the issues that have been had with previous European consortium developments - even the Tornado and Typhoon, which ultimately resulted in successful aircraft. Both suffered with countries pulling out from the consortium as their political winds changed, major partners introduced a lot of uncertainty by wavering in their commitment or cutting order numbers, there were disagreements over design choices at basically every step, and so on and so forth. It's like the inter-service issues that US procurement has, but with differing national interests and random domestic politics injected in, making it an even bigger hurdle.",

        "body": "A couple very very interesting things I learned the past week. These couple of things have really pointed to a different type of war in Ukraine than the narrative. \n\nThe two things are the following:\n* The air war in Ukraine is critical for Ukraine success and the Russian Air Force (VKS) is a very formidable enemy. This goes against the narrative that the Russian Air Force is shit. \n* Ukraine has mostly been depending on their own manpads (Igla-1s) rather than Stingers. This has a number of implications that are counter to the narrative.\n\nI base this mostly on the recent Geopolitics Decanted podcast: https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/how-the-russian-air-force-failed-in-ukraine\n\nSo first about the VKS. Russia essentially has all of the tools they need in order to perform effective attacks on Ukraine infrastructure. They have SEAD aircraft, cruise missiles, anti-radar weapons, and they have the numbers needed. Also, it seems like Russia is flying around 100 sorties a day over Ukraine, sometimes more. With those numbers, not being effective on the battlefield essentially means that Russia is being stopped by air defense and not due to VKS operational failures. \n\nWhy has the VKS failed? It seems like it comes down to a few key capability problems.\n\n* Training of pilots is a weak in the VKS - Probably not getting the 100 hours/year required to be proficient\n* Low training leads to not having reliable air-air refueling capability\n* Lack of air-air refueling causes difficulty coordinating large scale operations\n* Short range of some of Russian aircraft leading to difficulty coordinating large scale operations\n* An VKS doctrine that largely focuses on small scale, uncoordinated operations. Usually 1-2 aircraft\n\nGiven the above, essentially Russia is unable to perform high altitude (greater than 30k feet) sorties over the battlefield, which has severely limited the VKS capability to do CAS missions OR perform large scale bombing of Ukraine cities (Like what allies did in WW2 or what Russia does in Syria). \n\nThat has pretty much limited Russia to flying low altitude CAS missions on the front line. And that is just not very effective due to a number of reasons. It also causes those jets to be vulnerable to manpads, like stingers or the Igla-1. Most importantly, low altitude bombing does not allow for the use of PGMs. \n\nAll of this means that Ukraine absolutely needs to keep their air defense up and running. If they do not, Russia can re-prioritize their current ~100 sorties a day to high altitude bombing/CAS missions. Those CAS missions would be extremely effective as PGM bombs are super cheap and plentiful. Russia probably has thousand or maybe even tens of thousands of those types of bombs. \n\nOne thing Russia could do if they have coordinating and some good SEAD capability is suppress Ukraine's air defenses in an operating area, the move in with high altitude bombers and carpet bomb the Ukrainian positions (or use PGM bombs). Then attack with ground forces. That type of tactic would be extremely effective. OR Russia could carpet bomb cities from high altitude. Without effective, mid/high level air defenses, Ukraine would be defenseless against these tactics. Luckily, the VKS is incapable of such operations. \n\nSo yeah, the air war in Ukraine is extremely important. Ukraine having air defenses would be the highest priority. \n\nThe other big about Igla-1s being the most prolific manpad used by Ukraine is very very telling. I've heard next to nothing about them compared to stingers. It means that Ukraine is mostly just releasing information for propaganda reasons, aka, to get international support. If they keep quiet about their own weapons, then other countries will be more willing to lend support. I suspect that Ukraine has A LOT more self-produced, highly effective weapons than they are letting on. \n\nThe bottom line, Russia is punching below their weight and Ukraine is punching above their weight. If the situation changes, it's possible Russia could be landing even bigger punches.",

And how well do they work? \n\nI guess they have a tiny or reduced number of PGMs (non cruise missiles) and that those don't work so well (for example, GLONASS vs GPS).\n\nJDAMs can be released 80km away (some models, the majority at 30), an SBD/I can hit at almost 120km, numbers even higher than fake propaganda specs of air defenses. I don't even think ukrainians have a missile that in its theoretical ideal performance can surpass 80km. The one that fell in poland has a max range rated at 85km. That means that it probably become much less lethal well before that number, in real combat situations.\n\nSHORAD are extremely lethal as well, options for russian pilots are being killed by ukrainian long range AD when flying high and farther away, or being killed by ukrainian long range AD and ukrainian medium and short range AD when flying low. An S-300 can engage as low as 5km iirc.\n\nDon't know, I wouldn't assume russia has so many PGMs or that those are effective enough. We're not talking of 2000 munitions, USA alone procured 450.000 JDAMs. \n\nIt's just that that explanation doesn't convince me or at least it is partial. Long range PGMs were developed not to consume -10% fuel while doing a bombing campaign, but for their precision and for the fact that a pilot 150km away from his targets has 1/100.000 of the risk compared to a russian pilot that's exposed to just everything and has 1/100th of the time to react.\n\nIf they don't use these munition is likely because 1) they don't have them or 2) because they can't employ those effectively.\n\nThe 1) is likely true, they developed a sophisticated \"ballistic computer\" for dumb bombs just few years ago. You don't do this if you plan to hit 90 % of your targets with JDAM-like bombs.",

I don&#39;t even think ukrainians have a missile that in its theoretical ideal performance can surpass 80km. The one that fell in poland has a max range rated at 85km. That means that it probably become much less lethal well before that number, in real combat situations.</p>\n\n<p>SHORAD are extremely lethal as well, options for russian pilots are being killed by ukrainian long range AD when flying high and farther away, or being killed by ukrainian long range AD and ukrainian medium and short range AD when flying low. An S-300 can engage as low as 5km iirc.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t know, I wouldn&#39;t assume russia has so many PGMs or that those are effective enough. We&#39;re not talking of 2000 munitions, USA alone procured 450.000 JDAMs. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just that that explanation doesn&#39;t convince me or at least it is partial. Long range PGMs were developed not to consume -10% fuel while doing a bombing campaign, but for their precision and for the fact that a pilot 150km away from his targets has 1/100.000 of the risk compared to a russian pilot that&#39;s exposed to just everything and has 1/100th of the time to react.</p>\n\n<p>If they don&#39;t use these munition is likely because 1) they don&#39;t have them or 2) because they can&#39;t employ those effectively.</p>\n\n<p>The 1) is likely true, they developed a sophisticated &quot;ballistic computer&quot; for dumb bombs just few years ago. You don&#39;t do this if you plan to hit 90 % of your targets with JDAM-like bombs.</p>\n</div>",

So it has a 600 mile range, or 250 combat radius with roughly 5 minutes in combat with a 5 minute reserve. \n\nSu-34, Russia's more advanced strike aircraft, has a combat range of 680 miles. Roughly 3 hours of fuel. The distance from where they are likely based is around 200 miles from the front. That gives them about 2 hours to perform combat or be on station. This is important if they are running a SEAD operation, because they'll have to be over the battlefield the entire strike. \n\nThe problem that you run into when having 30-40 aircraft working in an operation, one or two of them will have a problem. What do you do if your key aircraft (say a SEAD airplane) is out of action? What do you do if planes have to divert due to thunderstorms or adverse weather? Also, they are probably coming out of 1-2 runways, it takes 5-10 minutes for 20 lined up aircraft to takeoff. Even if they takeoff in 2-3 aircraft formations. It's the same with coordinating landing. Traffic jams are a problem for military operations. \n\nAlso, jets use more fuel to climb. So they'll likely use 25-50% more burn rate for the first 20 minutes of climb to get up to altitude. So if you can refuel near the battlefield, an SU-34 could extend their time on station by probably 2-3 hours, which is a big deal. \n\nSo yeah, A2A refueling gives a whole new level of capability that it seems like Russia can't depend on.",

The graph is nice because it lets me play around with the sliders, so I can insert my own assumptions.\n\nMy usual changes/assumptions are -25% to the losses and 30% for the Usable tanks in storage, giving 6,477 tanks in total at the war's beginning. That's just to get what I believe is an accurate estimate of how many usable tanks they had at the start of the war, as well as how long it'll take to churn through them.\n\nBy the time we get to the date that suggests, 23 May 2024, Russia will certainly have built many more tanks (exactly how many being uncertain, on account of the sanctions and overall difficulties). Supposing they've been making 100 tanks per month consistently, and they can keep that up forever, that'd be another ~2,400 tanks still to be dealt with by that date. \n\nIn the time it'd take to break those (*assuming* the war's average rate of attrition, adjusted -25% for inflation of loss numbers, of ~250 tanks/month, which is a big assumption), they could make another ~960 tanks. That'd buy them enough time to make another ~384 tanks, those would buy them enough time to make ~154 tanks, those would buy them enough time to make ~61, then one more week to make ~25... and at that point, Russia would be close to fully drained and would probably have bigger problems to worry about.\n\nHonestly, that adds up over time. That's about ~3,984 extra tanks being produced in addition to the assumed 6,477 that my sliders give. It buys them another year and 4 months on paper (3,984 tanks * 1 month / 250 tanks). In practice, though, by that time, they'd have long since become so drained that they'd be falling apart in other ways- you obviously can't cover the front with so few tanks.\n\n---\n\nDisclaimer: All the above number-vomit is probably drowning in rounding errors. Even if the tanks/month assumptions are 100% accurate, there's still a fat margin of error on everything, and the situation can easily change.",
