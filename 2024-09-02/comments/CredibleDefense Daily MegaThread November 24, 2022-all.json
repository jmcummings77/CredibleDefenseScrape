That\u2019s basically nothing, and an SU-35 is probably straight up better than the F-16 or Gripen at that range, the Su-27 is closer but is still very dangerous.

If so they need -9x high off bore sight missiles, spare parts for the MiG who is already a very capable dog fighter, and tech upgrades to connect existing frames with better weapons and GPS. \n\nBut also Ukraine has and could get more flankers, which can also take Russia\u2019s best missiles.

Also, winter there is entirely different.\n\nThe main reason why so many people get so upset about 'whataboutism' is it forces them to confront their own double standards and even hypocrisy. Whether they are principled or opportunistic. Even if rural Vietnam during the Vietnam War was less dependent on electricity than say modern rural Ukraine, peasants in the countryside still had family members and friends that were maimed and killed by the bombings.

So far almost all strikes hit not generators or steam boiler compartments of TTPs, but most crucial conjunctions of Ukrainian high voltage networks. That's why electricity is quickly restored: Ukrainians reroute energy streams and replace destroyed high-voltage transformers. The only logical explanation for Russian tactics is that they aim to divide Ukrainian el. system into isolated clusters, and then, during major operations, have an ability to quickly turn off grid in whole regions and even all Eastern Ukraine. Contrary to many opinions, this is not a terror bombing campaign aiming at destroying Ukrainian economy for years ahead, because if that was the case strikes would be aimed at generators, not transformers.",

I honestly can&#39;t find much solid figures on western tbo, especially latest versions which I suspect are higher.</p>\n\n<p>So it does seem that 160hrs was potentially true some time ago, but it isn&#39;t the case now. Rather it depends on what engines Russia is using, with my gut leaning towards not the latest and greatest export version being common. Having such a huge increase in sorties for this war would put pressure on the overhaul depots.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean anyone donating used MIG-29&#39;s to Ukraine from 80&#39;s vintage wouldn&#39;t be providing much uplift to there fleet given the particularly poor performance history of its engines.</p>\n</div>",

The *Admiral Grigorovich*-class are capable of firing the 3M54T AShM with a range exceeding 600km, and the Oniks AShM with a range exceeding 600km. The Harpoon AShM has a range of range of less than 150km. The BSF can still easy stay out of range of Ukrainian shore based AShM batteries, while maintaining range on civilian shipping. Ukraine's drone fleet is based on jetskis, interestingly enough, and targeting ships in the open sea doesn't seem likely. At the same time their surface fleet can provide medium and short range AD.\n\n> Which has to launch aircraft from so far away at this point that Ukraine would have plenty of time to pull those choppers back under their land-based AD umbrella. \n\nI couldn't say on that. I don't know where Russia is basing their combat fighters out of. \n\n> So it makes sense that Ukraine will eventually need to acquire some capability to counter the threat\n\nThe problem with this is that ASW assets like helicopters are primarily area of denial systems. The helos can drop sonobuoys over a limited area, over a limited amount of time(until bingo fuel) and flood the area with active sonar. Submarines can pick up active sonar at well over twice the range the sending unit can detect a return. So flooding a area with sonobuoys will force submarines to stay out of the area, or to go deep and head beyond the themocline - or be fired upon by lightweight torpedoes. ASW helicopters are designed to operate off of a naval combat vessel like a frigate, destroyer, or cruiser. This allows for higher on station time, while the ship can provide passive, active, and VDS sonar itself along with lightweight torpedo launchers, and anti-submarine rockets(like the VL-ASROC, RBU-6000, Metel, etc). ASW is a cat and mouse problem, and if the mouse can still get the cheese occasionally like sinking 1 in 10 civilian ships, then civilian ships will not operate and merchant shipping will not happen. Ukraine would need far more than three ASW helos to conduct any sort of effective ASW program.",

The Harpoon AShM has a range of range of less than 150km. The BSF can still easy stay out of range of Ukrainian shore based AShM batteries, while maintaining range on civilian shipping. Ukraine&#39;s drone fleet is based on jetskis, interestingly enough, and targeting ships in the open sea doesn&#39;t seem likely. At the same time their surface fleet can provide medium and short range AD.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Which has to launch aircraft from so far away at this point that Ukraine would have plenty of time to pull those choppers back under their land-based AD umbrella. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I couldn&#39;t say on that. I don&#39;t know where Russia is basing their combat fighters out of. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So it makes sense that Ukraine will eventually need to acquire some capability to counter the threat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that ASW assets like helicopters are primarily area of denial systems. The helos can drop sonobuoys over a limited area, over a limited amount of time(until bingo fuel) and flood the area with active sonar. Submarines can pick up active sonar at well over twice the range the sending unit can detect a return. So flooding a area with sonobuoys will force submarines to stay out of the area, or to go deep and head beyond the themocline - or be fired upon by lightweight torpedoes. ASW helicopters are designed to operate off of a naval combat vessel like a frigate, destroyer, or cruiser. This allows for higher on station time, while the ship can provide passive, active, and VDS sonar itself along with lightweight torpedo launchers, and anti-submarine rockets(like the VL-ASROC, RBU-6000, Metel, etc). ASW is a cat and mouse problem, and if the mouse can still get the cheese occasionally like sinking 1 in 10 civilian ships, then civilian ships will not operate and merchant shipping will not happen. Ukraine would need far more than three ASW helos to conduct any sort of effective ASW program.</p>\n</div>",

All it needs for basic functionality is a target position, speed, and heading on launch. That can be provided by anything from NASAM radars to ground observers updating an app. Of course it&#39;s not going to be as effective that way, but there&#39;s also the advantage that the pilot wouldn&#39;t have any warning until the missile sees them. I sure wouldn&#39;t want AMRAAMs flying in my general direction if I was a pilot.</p>\n</div>",

Check out rob lee on twitter, he has a pinned article just for that.\n\nUkraine is operating a lot of tanks, possibly more than Russia is, including a number of well updated ones, both foreign, domestic, and captured. Their tanks are doing just fine, this is why they aren't sent them.\n\nWhat I do not understand, is why we are letting them rely on BMPs and BTRs and don't throw them M2 Bradleys, but its quite possibly we consider other aid more important so we are prioritizing elsewhere (as you said a lot of equipment but also HIMARs etc)",

There has been no known integration of the AN/ASQ-213 HARM, this is a sensor mounted on typical aircraft equipped with the AGM-88 that detects and classifies radar emissions. There has been talk that Ukraine is operating in a mode that allows the missile's own sensors to be integrated into the launching aircraft, being able to detect emissions albeit at a much reduced range. The most likely theory is that Ukraine managed to create a adapter to the mechanical and electrical standards of MIL-STD-1553. This would only require a mechanical adaptation, and converting whatever the Soviet era aircraft provides for electrical output to what the missile needs. Targets are located before hand, likely via NATO intelligence. The Ukrainian aircraft(both MiG-29 and Su-27s have been spotted equipped with the AGM-88) would fly to per-determined point and fires the missile. The AGM-88 has a [\"Pre-Briefed mode\"](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/how-ukraine-couldve-quickly-put-agm-88-anti-radiation-missiles-to-use) where it flies a flight path that is programmed before the flight. \n\nIf the AGM-88's sensors detect a radar emission that is within the attack profile it proceeds off the programmed path to the target. If no target is located the missile will eventually crash into something. The missile may also just crash into something regardless, failures do happen, and the US has never published data on that subject. Sorry, not a direct answer, but if the missiles are being fired in PB mode all Ukraine can do is rely on intelligence, and all the pilot can do is launch the missile at the per-determined point.
