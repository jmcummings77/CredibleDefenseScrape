Lots of good stuff in there, but the most important point by far is that Kharkiv was a rapid offensive *enabled* by attrition inflicted over the Summer in the Donbas by UAF. I think this is the most critical point missed by people here. \n\nThe UAF is not capable of rapid, decisive breakthroughs against prepared and fortified troops, the Russians arguably aren't at this point either. For both sides to achieve a breakthrough, the enemy force opposing them needs to be heavily attritioned. This is why Kherson went slow and Kharkiv went fast, the UAF was facing strong Russian formations in Kherson and depleted ones in Kharkiv. This is also why, as much as you don't want to hear it, Russia's mobilization has so far been successful in stabilizing the front. Masses of mobilized manpower have restored Russian fighting formations enough to allow them to mostly hold their existing positions against decisive offensives.\n\nThis is why the current reversal of the conflict into positonal, mostly attritional warfare isn't an indication of how the conflict will progress going forward. Kharkiv was *enabled* by heavy Russian attrition in Donbas over the summer, and future Ukrainian or Russian offensive success will only be possible with further enabling attrition over the next few months. \n\nI think this is why the Bakhmut offensive indicates a breakdown in Russian command structure that's ultimately going to make this war harder for them in the future. Yes the offensive against Bakhmut also attritions the UAF, and is preventing Ukr from reconstituting the formations employed there or employing them elsewhere. But as far as we can tell the Russians are suffering heavy causalities and expending huge amounts of artillery ammunition. In the context of their broader need to reconstitute their forces this offensive does not make sense. Success would not be decisive along the broader front, and they're expending huge amounts of resources that they need to preserve for future battles. \n\nDo you think Russian strategic command doesn't see this? My guess many Russian generals agree with this assessment, but they're being overridden by political objectives, and resistance from Wagner officials who want their sectors of the front to be prioritized. The offensive is clearly faltering, and now you see efforts from those same Wagnerites to deflect blame back onto the army for their failure. So you have a situation where possibly the RUF can see what needs to happen, but isn't able to stop a wasteful, pointless offensive simply because they don't have the clout to do so.",

This was the same case pre Kharkiv offensive when the talking point on this sub was that Ukraine wasn't capable of putting together a large, combined arms offensive. They hadn't done anything like that to that point, but it didn't mean they couldn't. \n\n> This is also why, as much as you don't want to hear it, Russia's mobilization has so far been successful in stabilizing the front.\n\nI'm a bit disappointed that Kofman paid no heed to the effects of weather and moving GLOCs in his latest piece, when those two factors have probably played as big a role as the mobilized troops in \"stabilising\" the front. You can look at virtually **any** video report of the fighting along the Svatove/Kremmina front and it's exceedingly muddy. Similarly, moving AD, artillery, and general supply lines over 100km from Balakliya to the front, past the Oskil river, doesn't receive enough attention. That would have taken the Ukrainians significant time as well, especially as they would have wanted to consolidate their gains over key towns such as Izyum and Lyman. Having said all that, the underlying point he's making is undeniably true: mass has certainly been a major factor in slowing the Ukrainian offensive. \n\n> most important point by far is that Kharkiv was a rapid offensive enabled by attrition inflicted over the Summer in the Donbas by UAF\n\nWhile Kofman mostly speaks of artillery ammo usage in the fighting for Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne and Popasna, another key factor which I believe was equally, if not even more important, was time. Time for the Ukrainians to receive and employ HIMARS, train and organize reserves, time to build secondary and tertiary defensive lines in towns such as Bakhmut, and time to attrite and slowly bleed Russian equipment. But what's strange is that whenever he discusses time, it's always from a vantage point of Western support for Ukraine, but one could argue that time's working even more so against Putin. Wars of conquest are never sustainably supported by the home population, even if that means little on the ground at first. Iraq and Afghanistan are but two recent examples of this, and while they're not analogous to the current war, you can go back through time and find better examples. When militaries are even close to evenly matches, the natives will fight for their land a lot harder and for a lot longer than the invaders. But more importantly, if you do give the West enough time to do the \"right thing\" and get industrial production up, that's going to work against the Russian military in the long term.\n\n>In the context of their broader need to reconstitute their forces this offensive does not make sense.\n\nAnd that's just Bakhmut. The attacks on Pavlivka, Velyka Novosilka, Avdiivka and Marinka have also been quite resource hungry.

No one is going to get you to that level of specificity and granularity.  \n\n>and they are obviously not expending 50k shells a day like in the summer but they are still shelling. Rationing expenditure does not necessarily mean they are running out, it means they are trying to make expenditure sustainable, which is all I am arguing.\n\nYou said \"they can sustain artillery in that sector with North Korean and refurbished ammo, or by using tank shells\". That's not true, according to Kofman, and U.S. and U.K. intelligence.

The date of the production is 1939 based on the title credits. \n\n>Credits: Produced by The Signal Corps in collaboration with the Chief of Ordnance 1939 - Manufacturing Shell For 3 inch Anti-Aircraft Guns (:07-:27). This film will show how make the shell our narrator tells us at the Frankford Arsenal factory in Philadelphia, PA. Exterior shots of the factory are shown. This was made to show that there are no hazards with building shells in populated areas (:28-[1:07](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=67s)). Steel bars are shown whole and then being cut. Size is discussed. Men in the factory are at work. How to make the shell is explained and shown. The bar is shown before heating and then in succession based on what station, first, second, third, and fourth and final station. The forging is shown. A crank press shears them. The outer shell is seen going into the air outside for cooling ([1:08](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=68s)-[4:31](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=271s)). Our workers continue to make them. The rotating bands are cut. Walls of the shell are used as a test specimen ([4:32](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=272s)-[7:05](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=425s)). Forgings are placed into a machine to smooth since the explosives are to be loaded into this cavity. They are then sent to the shell machining shop. The shell is centered. All of the procedure is shown and explained. Process inspection follows. The shell is played with and made sure to be of use ([7:06](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=426s)-[10:47](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=647s)). The shell is placed into a drilling and tap machine. Watch as the process continues. More of the procedure is shown. Lots of closeups of the machines at work. Slow and thorough. The shell is almost done. Base is finished ([10:48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=648s)-[13:16](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=796s)). The shell is notched next. Stamping machine is next. The process continues as it continues on its way. A band is going to be placed onto the shell. It is time to have it be ready for its finished size, this is shown. A steel disc is welded to the base of the shell ([13:17](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=797s)-[17:01](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=1021s)). Washed in a hot bath is next for the shell. Final inspection table is next. Size and specs it should be are listed. Dimensional and weight tolerances have been given to the shell and must be abided by. Workers work on and weigh the shell casings ([17:02](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=1022s)-[19:00](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=1140s)). Men lift the casings. A protective coating grease is placed on the approved ones. Final steps performed on the shells. Shells then packed to be shipped to the assembly plant ([19:01](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=1141s)-[20:24](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BPGqLjnNIJY&t=1224s)).

Basically the Russians formed a large VDV concentration on the east bank, which looked like it was point at Chernihiv (because of the assumption that the bridge to Chernobyl would be cut), but then slipped them over the river in the early morning.\n\nThe EMD only had four brigades on the west bank of the Pripyat, so pre-war it looked like this was mostly an east bank operation. The Ukrainians had contingency plans in place for a landing on Hostomel (they had been aware of the risk since before 2019) but they definitely weren't expecting the 26-28 maneuver Bns that got chucked towards the capital.\n\nChernihiv is more complex. The 1st Tank Brigade was actually caught a lot further north than the Ukrainians wanted it. The operational plan, based on pre-war maneuvers, was actually to form a grouping of the 72nd Mechanized and 1st Tank south of Chernihiv.\n\nThis goes into the reason why the border wasn't held so strongly.

The Russians actually were wrongfooted by what the Ukrainians did, because they were hoping on catching as much of the Ukrainian army as possible in that initial wave of fires.

                        "body": "My personal opinion is that the Ukrainian operational plan was largely psychological operations, to try to drive the Russians out of the west bank of Kherson without a fight.\n\nBack in mid July the Ukraine govt officials blabbing to the media were actually baiting an offensive in \"the south\" and \"the coast,\" not in the Kherson bridgehead, so either Kherson or Zaporizhzhia oblasts east of the Dnieper, the one place everyone still expects an offensive but still hasn't happened. \n\nThe Russians caught that and started moving troops to reinforce both by late July. Then something very confusing happened that I think is a big tip off, BEFORE the Russian reinforcements could cross the Dnieper the UAF started striking the bridges. And yet never took out all the bridges and other means, which to me points that they wanted to show the Russians they could interdict their lines of communication before the battle even started. IE, a deterrent to reinforcing or even fighting.\n\nLater, they pushed a public narrative that a huge offensive would happen soon, that they didn't care if it took into 2023 to drive the Russians out, they were going to attrit them with fires and starve them of supplies, etc. Again, a deterrent from fighting. Especially considering how much bullshit some of the statements were. Like when Zelensky, who almost does cartwheels whenever a village is liberated, is saying to the media that he doesn't care if anything in Kherson is liberated anytime soon.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My personal opinion is that the Ukrainian operational plan was largely psychological operations, to try to drive the Russians out of the west bank of Kherson without a fight.</p>\n\n<p>Back in mid July the Ukraine govt officials blabbing to the media were actually baiting an offensive in &quot;the south&quot; and &quot;the coast,&quot; not in the Kherson bridgehead, so either Kherson or Zaporizhzhia oblasts east of the Dnieper, the one place everyone still expects an offensive but still hasn&#39;t happened. </p>\n\n<p>The Russians caught that and started moving troops to reinforce both by late July. Then something very confusing happened that I think is a big tip off, BEFORE the Russian reinforcements could cross the Dnieper the UAF started striking the bridges. And yet never took out all the bridges and other means, which to me points that they wanted to show the Russians they could interdict their lines of communication before the battle even started. IE, a deterrent to reinforcing or even fighting.</p>\n\n<p>Later, they pushed a public narrative that a huge offensive would happen soon, that they didn&#39;t care if it took into 2023 to drive the Russians out, they were going to attrit them with fires and starve them of supplies, etc. Again, a deterrent from fighting. Especially considering how much bullshit some of the statements were.

The UAF definitely weren't focusing on force preservation, the opposite actually.\n\nDuring the first phase of the invasion the Ukrainians only withdrew or refused battle when they were incapable of defending. Otherwise they performed literal \"hold or die\" defenses, largely done by barely competent TDF volunteers who suffered notoriously heavy losses. \n\nIn the spring and summer while defending the Donbas they deliberately chose \"hold at all cost\" positional defenses over maneuver defense. There can be many reasons why they chose that, which I won't get into, but tactically that left them immobile against an opponent whose only strength was heavy fires, so the UAF purposely put themselves into the position that made them very vulnerable to said fires, where they took massive casualties, supposedly 60-200 KIA (from Zelensky's office). Severodonetsk doesn't characterize the overall operation, as it was a stubborn defense poorly primarily using TDF, whereas the Russian operational successes that led to taking Luhansk came from UAF losses in the southern portion of the salient.\n\nAdditionally, in late April and early May, the UAF launched a 3-5 brigade sized counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast. It was performed against 5-7 strung out and weak Russian battalions so saw lots of success pushing the Russians back but after a couple weeks the Russians counterattacked, leading to seesaw attrition fighting that lasted until early September when the Russians retreated following the loss of Izyum. \n\nIn late May through June, while they were having major issues in the Donbas and already committed to Kharkiv too, the UAF launched another counteroffensive in the Kherson bridgehead, which saw some limited success in the south but also included a lingering month long attempt to cross the Inhulets River at Davydiv Brid to try to drive east down the T2207 highway, that if successful would have cut the bridgehead in two. But that was a failure, with Ukraine's attempt to conduct a river crossing being heavily contested, eventually losing the bridgehead to heavy fires and counterattacks.\n\nThe brevity of new recruit initial training is indicative of the struggles they faced with manpower issues and losses. There were credible reports of UAF sending totally untrained or barely trained troops directly into battle due to necessity. Early NATO initial training was only three weeks long due to the need for high turnover. As of September, new infantry officers being inducted to serve in the air assault forces (more elite than Ukrainian Ground Forces) were only getting four weeks of training. All of these were incredibly ruthless decisions made because the Ukrainians were suffering heavy casualties while also being highly active performing voluntary counteroffensives and rigid positional defensive operations.\n\nIf Ukraine was actually focused on force preservation they'd have done a maneuver defense of the Donbas, trying to regain mobility to the detriment of the Russians (whose tactics only work in a static battlefield). While they might also have conducted counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts, they'd not have allowed either to turn into meat grinders. \n\nI won't elaborate on casualty numbers as they're impossible to calculate based on what we know from OSINT, but UAF self-reported losses are nearly as full of shit as Russian self-reported losses.",
