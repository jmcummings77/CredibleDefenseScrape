Is it possible that Russia just planned a 'mine belt' and haven't laid extensive mine fields further back? In view of the excessive number of mines Russia has deployed forward, are Russian logistics capable of duplicating the effort between say the second and third fortifications line? Don't bother telling me how many mines Russia has, if you don't include a plan for getting them there.\n\n2. I'm still not sold on a Dnipro  River crossing, even with the second bridgehead. I think we would need to see a 3rd and possibly a fourth incursion to spread Russian forces out far enough to justify an effort, complete with a non-mech brigade level commitment and a large enough zone of control to build a couple of pontoon bridges. If I hear that a raid/landing is occurring at Hola Prystan, I'll sit up and pay attention. \n\n3. What is the true state of Russian artillery in Zaporizhzhia? If Ukrainian announcements are to be believed, they've eliminated about 20% of Russia's artillery in a single month and a half. I don't  happen to believe such numbers but I o believe 10% based on 1) Every Russian who talks about it describes an artillery apocalypse, disaster, even 'genocide' (don't use that word, kids); 2) enough clips have been shared on twitter and telegram to support a large number an 3) The only new guns entering the sector are towed- If they had any SPGs left, they would be rushing in. \n\n4. Are any Russian troop rotations happening? the 47th and other 9th corps brigades have moved off the front line. I suspect they'll be back to full strength with new Bradleys and Maxpros in less than a month.  Are the Russians doing the same.\n\n5. As always, I ask, where the hell is the 13th Huntsmen Brigade? the last sighting was from May, training in Norway and Sweden, and the last post on their facebook page was of helo assault training, 90 days ago. As a unit trained for fighting in bogs,marsh and woods, maybe training just takes longer.\n\nedit- that formatted strange",

What's not entirely clear to me yet is to what extent the artillery shortages are proportionally attributable to each of the following factors: (1) lack of raw ammunition supply available from reserves or new production; (2) battlefield losses of SPGs, howitzers, and MLRSs, which cannot be readily replaced from reserves; (3) inadequate replacement parts (including barrels for tube arty) to support repairs, never mind routine preventative maintenance during what is indisputably a period of peak intensity wear and tear; and (4) logistical challenges delivering all of the above to the battlefield from rear areas, resulting either from disruptions caused by the Ukrainian interdiction campaigns, simple lack of transpo capacity, or both.

So far, the only Russian troop rotations I have observed and/or that ISW has reported on have been lateral rotations, with units pulling off the line in relatively quiet sectors to transfer immediately into fights elsewhere along the front. \n\n> Lateral transfers of forces from one part of an active line to another are undesirable. They can disrupt offensive or defensive operations in the sectors from which they are drawn and put great pressure on soldiers who must withdraw from combat in one area, move rapidly to another, and immediately launch into new fighting without time to rest men and repair or replace equipment. The fact that the Russian command has generated reinforcements for threatened sectors in this fashion rather than by sending uncommitted reserves, together with the widespread complaints about the lack of rotations of frontline units, strongly suggests that the Russians simply do not have uncommitted operational or strategic reserves.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine reportedly is able to maintain regular and reasonable troop rotations, keeping their troops relatively fresh even as they've continued to maintain steady pressure on Russian positions in Zaporizhzhia.

        "body": "[Russian women fear return of murderers freed to fight for Wagner](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/19/russian-women-wagner-convicts-war-ukraine)\n\nConcern that convicts re-entering society after stints in Ukraine will bring \u2018wave of murder, rape and domestic violence\u2019\n\n\nThe 2020 murder of Vera Pekhteleva, by her ex-boyfriend, was so gruesome that even in Russia, where violence against women often goes under the radar, it caused a media outcry.\n\nVladislav Kanyus spent hours torturing Pekhteleva before she died; neighbours repeatedly called police to report horrifying screams coming from the neighbouring apartment, but the police did not show up. At trial, it emerged there had been 111 injuries on Pekhteleva\u2019s body.\n\nLast summer, a court in Siberia sentenced Kanyus to 17 years in prison for the murder. Pekhteleva\u2019s family members were disappointed that the judge dismissed additional charges of rape and unlawful imprisonment, but breathed a sigh of relief that the murder charge alone would put Kanyus behind bars for 17 years.\n\nNine months later, in the middle of May, Pekhteleva\u2019s mother received two photographs from an anonymous account on WhatsApp. They showed a man in military fatigues and were accompanied by a message: \u201cKanyus is free, and fighting in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, I tried to calm her down, I tried to say it wasn\u2019t him, it was Photoshop. But we quickly realised it really was him,\u201d said Vladimir Pekhtelev, Vera\u2019s uncle, in a telephone interview from the Siberian city of Kemerovo.\n\nKanyus, it seemed, was one of tens of thousands of Russian prisoners freed early to fight in Ukraine. The vast majority ended up fighting for Wagner group, the private army run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who in June went rogue and launched an armed mutiny that sent shock waves through the Russian political system before it was aborted.\n\nAs part of the deal, convicts were told that if they fought for six months and survived, they would be allowed to go back to normal life without serving the rest of their sentences. Later, prisoners were also freed to fight for the regular Russian army and for other Wagner-like formations fighting with the Russians in Ukraine.\n\nWhen the Pekhtelevs put in an official request to prison authorities to locate Kanyus, they were told he had been transferred to the prison service of Rostov region, bordering Ukraine, and had disappeared. Activists say this is a typical administrative trail for a prisoner recruited to fight in Ukraine; there are no other plausible reasons for a transfer to Rostov.\n\n\u201cNobody can tell us how he was let out, nobody gave us any answer, any explanation,\u201d said Pekhtelev.\n\nIt is not clear whether Kanyus is still fighting, but it certainly appears he is still alive, as he has posted regular updates to an account on VKontakte, a Russian social media network. His account has the tagline: \u201cThere is no such thing as the right choice, there\u2019s just the choice you make and the consequences of it.\u201d\n\nIn July, Kanyus responded to a message asking about his current status and whereabouts with a demand for payment in order to answer questions. Later, he locked his account.\n\nThe full ramifications of the decision to allow Prigozhin to build a private army of prisoners became clear when he launched his aborted mutiny. But as well as the political fallout, Putin\u2019s experiment with Prigozhin is likely to have a significant social impact on Russia for years to come.\n\nThere have been numerous reports of ex-prisoners surviving their Wagner stint and returning home to cause havoc. Among those freed are many who committed violent crimes against women.\n\nRussian authorities have a long history of not taking domestic violence or threats of violence against women seriously. Now, even in those cases where offenders received jail terms, victims and their families live in fear of them returning home much sooner than expected.\n\nVyacheslav Samoilov, from a small town in northern Russia, murdered 33-year-old Olga Shlyamina in March 2021 and later dismembered and hid her body. He was jailed for nine years and seven months in April 2022, but is now apparently free after fighting for three months in Ukraine.\n\nSamoilov\u2019s mother told , a local news site in Russia\u2019s Arkhangelsk region, that her son had fought and been injured in Ukraine, and had now been pardoned. His mother said \u201che is cleansed before God\u201d, by his service in Ukraine.\n\nVadim Tekhov, who killed 22-year-old Regina Gagieva in the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz in 2019, was meant to be in jail until 2035, but was pardoned after fighting in Ukraine and has returned to Vladikavkaz.\n\n\u201cHe was sent there, served for six months and in accordance with the law has now been released early,\u201d the head of the North Ossetia region, Sergei Menyailo, confirmed in a press conference earlier this year, adding that in Tekhov\u2019s place, he would not have returned home.\n\nThere are also those who were jailed for rape or violence, whose victims are still alive and are now again at risk.\n\n\u201cWe have been getting so many messages from people who are scared, especially from the regions. They know that if the men who tormented them come back from this war, and start to beat them again or even kill them, the police will not do anything, because now these men are seen as heroes instead of rapists or killers,\u201d said Alena Popova, a Russian women\u2019s rights activist.\n\n\u201cThey are returning to a situation where they will now be setting the rules of the game. They are all super-traumatised, nobody is working with them to socialise them, and I think there will be a wave of murder, rape and domestic violence.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Kanyus, Pekhteleva\u2019s family fears he could return and try to take revenge for their efforts to publicise the case at the time of the trial. The family\u2019s refusal to stay quiet meant the case resonated with the public, and the police who failed to show up to the repeated calls for help from the neighbours were even tried for negligence.\n\n\u201cShe is scared for herself now,\u201d said Vladimir Pekhtelev, of his sister-in-law, Vera\u2019s mother. \u201cWhat if she will see him back in Kiselevsk, walking down the street? Of course she\u2019s worried he could try to take revenge for the campaigning the family has been doing.\u201d\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nI\u2019m sure no one saw this coming. to rub salt in the wounds of these women and their families, many are glorifying Wagner (even here) and the war crimes they commit not just in Ukraine but everywhere they go.",

They've formulated a strategy of attrition with special emphasis being on degrading their artillery capabilities and further exacerbating logistical constraints that have been plaguing Russia since the beginning. We can argue whether an IMV is more valuable than a supply truck - in some instances it might not even be. But on average Ukraine is trading their less valuable vehicles (as well as having the added benefit of being more readily available from the West) for everything that we've heard Russia has been struggling with (Counter-battery radars, SPGs, MLRS systems, supply trucks) as well as AD assets which currently aren't there in sufficient numbers to protect Russia proper nor their key logistical nodes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I should write up a larger writeup for this at one point, but the social media Ukrainian theory of victory for this offensive is starting to resemble the Russian theory of victory for the 2022 Donbas offensives.\n\nIn other words, this isn't quite correct. Russians have really emphasized the pure mass and volume of their artillery throughout that campaign, not focusing down on more precise strikes that would hurt Ukraine in longer terms. Granted, Ukraine in that period was nowhere near to matching Russian artillery by numbers or by volume, and it stands to reason that by extension Russia in many ways simply couldn't have done the same back then.\n\nI think it's extremely interesting to note just how the level of destruction in the villages (sizes of maybe up to a hundred or so individual houses, mostly poorly built as is the case in these areas) Ukraine has taken is simply far, far below what we've seen in the Donbas back last summer, and a lot of the destruction came after Ukraine has entered the villages and Russians massed artillery fire onto them. In other words, their underlying artillery usage is, from everything we've seen, **markedly different** to what Russia employed back then - endless barrages (most likely due to pervasive push logistics as well as an emphasis on the old Soviet \"mathematical\" approach to artillery usage) that were both expanding ammo for very little gain (on a \"per shell\" as opposed to UAF, if that makes sense) and wearing out their artillery systems. Meanwhile, last summer we've seen Russia completely level whole large towns and significantly damage cities (on average, much better built than your average house in a small village in a poor region) that soaked a lot of the ammo. I think it's often overlooked that AFUs did defend larger urban settlements precisely because they are aware of it mitigating Russian advantages in artillery (offering desperately needed ad hoc cover, concealment, etc.) as well as exploiting their inability to give up such an approach due to their doctrine (\\*edit as well as a doctrinal lack of infantry). In other words, both Russian and UAF strategy last summer to a point enabled UAF to currently have an advantage in artillery in decently sized sectors as well having parity in a number of other sectors - this was simply unimaginable last summer. I don't think this was purely an incidental effect, as is often presented here. Russian strategy last summer (possibly up to a degree in Bakhmut, too, but that's a separate discussion where the whole maths looks a lot less rosy, to put it mildly) hurt them on a strategical level to such a degree that it IMO borders sheer incompetence. I don't think they've completely changed their approach either - just look at the reports of a month or two long artillery preparation for their crossing over the Zherebets river.\n\nI am not saying this current attrition strategy is going to yield tangible gains within the time frame of the current counter offensive - but it could be argued it is a way more beneficial medium-to-long term strategy than Russians ever employed last summer.

Forgive my horrible graphics! For the [background map](https://map.ukrdailyupdate.com) I used Andrew Perpetua's.  \n\nA few caveats: the Russian armies are not textbook field armies - they can be compared with a NATO Corps (such as the 58th Army) or a Division in most cases (such as EMD Armies, except the 5th). The armies' brigades/regiments are not 100% manned/equipped - both because no unit is ever at that level during a war and because a part of the Russian formations are made up of conscripts from the military service who are not deployed in Ukraine.

In the sector of the 58th Army, there are two regiments of the 7th VDV Division, two Spetsnaz GRU brigades, several BARS detachments, elements of the 7th Military Base of the 49th Army and of course the territorial regiments attached to the 58th Army; in the sector of the 5th Army there is another regiment of the 7th VDV Division and the 136th Motorized Brigade and the 71st Motorized Regiment of the 58th Army; in that of the 36th Army there is the 34th Mountain Brigade of the 49th Army plus reinforcements in terms of units of the 1st Corps (former DPR Army).

From the end of the sector of the 68th Corps then begins that of the 8th Army of the Southern MD, covering from Marinka to the Siversky Donets River (including Bakhmut I assume).

Ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang on Thursday did not confirm or deny a possible Biden visit.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;High-level leaders of the two countries have agreed and are discussing measures to further deepen bilateral relation in a stable, substantive and long-term manner, and aiming to upgrade (the relation) to a new level when possible,&quot; Hang told a regular press conference.</p>\n\n<p>At a meeting in April, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed a desire to\u00a0deepen ties\u00a0as Washington seeks to solidify relations with partners in Asia to counter an increasingly assertive China.</p>\n\n<p>Officials have not said what the closer relationship might entail, but experts say it could include increased military cooperation and U.S. weapon supplies.</p>\n</div>",

With effectively twice the range of legacy F-16 radars, it is being used to upgrade hundreds of F-16C aircraft, both in the US and abroad.\n\nThe F-16 MLU arms many European air forces and is being effectively phased out at this time, it was an upgrade to initial F-16 ADF aircraft to generally modernise them, but specifically to give them AIM-120 capability.\nIt did not directly upgrade the APG-66 radar, but it did modernise the backend of the avionics with more modern digital systems, including digital glass cockpit displays.\n\nI think it would be possible to upgrade; other aircraft like the FA-50 have been proposed for SABR, however I don't know how much integration work would be required compared to F-16C where it is relatively simple.\n\nI ask because this could be a relatively low cost upgrade that would massively improve the capability of any potential donated F-16s to Ukraine, potentially enable the use of AIM-120D and possibly even allow for the integration of Meteor (main obstacle would likely be non-technical from MDBA/France/Sweden).\n\nEdit: the USAF supposedly bought 30 radars from Northrop Grumman in 2022 for around 90 million dollars.\nOn the F-16C block 40/50 it's supposedly almost a plug and play upgrade, but I don't know if the same is true for older variants.",

Russia should have prepared their entire military for total war against a Ukraine that is determined to fight back, and has western support. But hindsight is 20/20. \n\nIt's often said that Putin(regime) / Russia miscalculated very badly, and not just them; but also western academics, generals, etc. Even people who predicted this war and invasion would happen, did not think Ukraine would last for long. That said, you still have people *within* Russia and some within the regime who predicted the invasion becoming the shitshow that it did, one notable Soviet general with a storied history, and a military analyst/journalist&and part of the *establishment*. \n\nSo we can't just automatically assume that miscalculations were made, I don't disagree that it's the most likely that mistakes were made. But we should also entertain the idea that the regime knew what would happen, and still chose to run into fire. What if the major \"miscalculation\" wasn't about Ukraine, but about west and its institutions, about the reactions of the global community? \n\nPutin has long talked about bringing Russia back to its \"proper\" place as a major power, long before 2014. Zbigniew Brzezinski said that without Ukraine, Russia can't be an imperial power. And while that might be true, is it worth getting Ukraine if the whole of west disconnects, if you become isolated? \n\n>Russia has driven this war ideologically, thinking their Ukrainian \u201cbrothers\u201d would support them, and the government \u201cpropped up by the west\u201d would flee like cowards. \n\nI think ideology has a major influence of course, but we can't ignore the realist argument; especially when keeping in mind Russia's history. One can talk about revanchism, imperialism, etc. but the main ideology of Russia for hundreds of years is paranoia. \n\n>At bottom of Kremlin's neurotic view of world affairs is traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity. Originally, this was insecurity of a peaceful agricultural people trying to live on vast exposed plain in neighborhood of fierce nomadic peoples. To this was added, as Russia came into contact with economically advanced West, fear of more competent, more powerful, more highly organized societies in that area. But this latter type of insecurity was one which afflicted rather Russian rulers than Russian people; for Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned truth about world without or if foreigners learned truth about world within. And they have learned to seek security only in patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it. - George Kennan, 1946 on Stalin's USSR. \n\nIt's amazing how this has largely remained true to the present day. \n\n>It feels almost evil to say, but they should have leveraged their corruption and tentacles in western politics/industries more. I am 100% behind Ukraine, so I\u2019m glad that this scenario didn\u2019t play out. But, as for what I\u2019d have done differently, that\u2019s where I\u2019d have used political soft power and espionage. \n\nI guess the initial question assumes that the war is already in full swing, but I think what you say is 100% the best strategy Russia could've utilized; *without* resorting to an actual invasion. IF Russia's concerns are in regards to security(either military or those outlined under peaceful evolution theory), then simply keeping a corrupt presence in Ukraine is the best choice. That and continuing to wage a hybrid war, something Russia is good at. \n\nI always thought that this strategy not being utilized is a sign that there's a lot of other reasons for the invasion. Ideology, realist security concerns(real or imagined), and economical reasons. Ukraine linking with west would also represent a loss of gas/oil revenue. Russia was fine with Ukraine making deals with Shell/Chevron in ~2012-2013 already, decade long and multi-billion deals at that; because Ukraine was still firmly under the influence of Russia. Yanukovych signed those deals after all. Once elements of Russia's influence in Ukraine are removed, the potential economic ramifications of Shell/Chevron working in Ukraine become untenable. \n\nOne of the factors that lead to more cooperation between USSR and west was the economic linkage between Europe(mainly Germany) and USSR. Germany needed energy, and USSR needed Germany's infrastructure expertise, manufacturing, and money. A very obvious partnership that enriched both countries. This cooperation obviously bothered US for various reasons. \n\nThe main point I'd like to make with that in mind is that underneath it all, for most of modern European history there have been various attempts made by preeminent European regional powers to consolidate their strength and control the continent. The major episodes would include UK, then Germany, and finally USSR/Russia. Germany needs Russian energy to be a major power, and Russia needs German industry/knowledge base to be one. USA doesn't want either side, or anyone else to dominate the continent; because that might challenge their own security.  \n\nThe EU project is seen by most countries in the west to change this, but for Russia it is just another form of imperialism(see peaceful evolution theory); since neither side trusts the other, conflict emerges. In that sense, some sort of war with Russia was unavoidable. Mainly because Russia has never really integrated with west in a real way. We know that economic linkage is not a guarantee of peace, one needs to penetrate through social/cultural means to make a real difference.",

It would likely have ended there and easily be sold as a win by Putin, to the outrage of nationalists on both sides - but c&#39;est la vie.</p>\n</div>",

And poor OPSEC is definitely a problem.\n\nHowever, of course, the military should do everything in its power to avoid civilian casualties. But the idea that a military fighting an existential war shouldn't use civilian infrastructure is a complete fantasy. It happens all the time because it's unavoidable.\n\nThe military doesn't use special military roads. Military aircraft don't fly in special military airspace.
