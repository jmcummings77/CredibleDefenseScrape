                                    "body": "We were hypothetically suggesting the Russians might take Bakhmut in 2022. Then they took it, largely defensed it against Ukraine's best attempt at a strategic counteroffensive in this war and are now retaking what they lost. They're only ~ 2 miles from the canal/ridgeline that dominates Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. If they can get there, those cities are in big trouble. \n\nEven a year ago, Bakhmut being lost wasn't a given. A few months before, in early December of 2022, I even suggested the Russians had no chance to take Bakhmut, because a direct assault would be too costly and a deep concentric encirclement was absolutely absurd. And yet both were reality.\n\nWarfare isn't a constant, and things are looking bleak right now for the Ukrainians. Credible sources are reporting the Russians are dramatically outshooting the Ukrainians in both artillery and FPV drones, which is going to mean more Ukrainian casualties, less Russian since they'll be make up for their tactical impotence with weight of fires. Growing casualties is always dangerous, but most especially when so much of the UAF is tired from their offensive and with major problems creating new units or even replacing losses in existing units due to an ever worsening manpower crisis.  \n\nThere are no good answers to those problems right now. But one thing is absolutely true about warfare: defeats breed further defeats, because each triggers outcomes that cause further problems, that lead to worse performance, that lead to more defeats, etc. \n\nIf Ukraine can't turn their problems around, or land themselves a miracle if it turns out the Russians have already dramatically overextended themselves and we missed seeing the fracture points yet (though it would be tough for that to happen since the manpower, equipment, and supply issues that caused the fall 2022 problems aren't happening now), the current situation can actually rapidly turn into a snowball effect of tactical defeats.

Then they took it, largely defensed it against Ukraine&#39;s best attempt at a strategic counteroffensive in this war and are now retaking what they lost. They&#39;re only ~ 2 miles from the canal/ridgeline that dominates Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. If they can get there, those cities are in big trouble. </p>\n\n<p>Even a year ago, Bakhmut being lost wasn&#39;t a given. A few months before, in early December of 2022, I even suggested the Russians had no chance to take Bakhmut, because a direct assault would be too costly and a deep concentric encirclement was absolutely absurd. And yet both were reality.</p>\n\n<p>Warfare isn&#39;t a constant, and things are looking bleak right now for the Ukrainians. Credible sources are reporting the Russians are dramatically outshooting the Ukrainians in both artillery and FPV drones, which is going to mean more Ukrainian casualties, less Russian since they&#39;ll be make up for their tactical impotence with weight of fires. Growing casualties is always dangerous, but most especially when so much of the UAF is tired from their offensive and with major problems creating new units or even replacing losses in existing units due to an ever worsening manpower crisis.  </p>\n\n<p>There are no good answers to those problems right now. But one thing is absolutely true about warfare: defeats breed further defeats, because each triggers outcomes that cause further problems, that lead to worse performance, that lead to more defeats, etc. </p>\n\n<p>If Ukraine can&#39;t turn their problems around, or land themselves a miracle if it turns out the Russians have already dramatically overextended themselves and we missed seeing the fracture points yet (though it would be tough for that to happen since the manpower, equipment, and supply issues that caused the fall 2022 problems aren&#39;t happening now), the current situation can actually rapidly turn into a snowball effect of tactical defeats. Each one weakens Ukraine strategically, each emboldens Russia. </p>\n\n<p>And if that happens, I&#39;m not saying the Russians will reach Dnipro, cross the Dnieper, reach Odessa, or take Kyiv.

Egypt doesn't have the capability to develop a peer comparative fighter (At least not economically).\n\nThey also occupy an extremely thin band geopolitically speaking, they are one of only a few countries to openly align themselves with both spheres of influence and the Israeli/Gaza conflict in particular has demonstrated how carefully they're willing to thread the needle to ensure they don't step on any political landmines.\n\nFor what it's worth Egypt have largely increased their share of Russian export aircraft over the last decade, their fleet is still primarily western and will continue to be so if they succeed in acquiring the Eurofighter Typhoon, but it's simply worth noting that Egypt likes to spread money around between both spheres when it comes to procurement which is part pragmatic and also part political.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning the context of these procurements:\n\n**The Egyptian Air Force is approaching a cliff in the next 10 years in regards to the more or less forced retirement of a very large portion of their active airframes which explains their relative scramble in the last 5-10 years of buying anything currently available for order.**\n\nThey have a large fleet of F-16's, around 200 or so active airframes (many have received upgrades) and the majority of the airframes were delivered and have been active since the 1980s/1990s making them only slightly newer than the clapped out F16's that The Netherlands are transferring to Ukraine, the same F16's that they were struggling to keep in the air... I'm certain the Egyptian F16's are in much better shape than the Dutch ones, but they're still old airframes at this stage, metal fatigue and ever increasing maintenance costs will force Egypt's hand eventually and they've already begun the process of shopping around for replacements.\n\nThey also have a large fleet of Mirage 5's which are approaching 50 years old and are currently being offered to Pakistan for export (although I have no clue why Pakistan would be interested, these airframes are practically ancient). For all intents and purposes these Mirage 5's are out the door already.\n\nThey also have a fleet of Mirage 2000s which is expected to increase when the UAE transfers their remaining airframes to Egypt, but this fleet is also 37 odd years old, we're not talking about new airframes here and the writing is already on the wall for their eventual retirement.\n\n***This is all to say that Egypt is already well aware of its incoming challenges and this helps to explain the \"scatter gun\" approach to procurement we've seen over the last decade or so.***\n\nInitially Egypt were interested in the MiG-35 back in 2014 but instead settled with the more readily available MiG-29M/M2, they also acquired 50 Ka-52's (ironically to partially provide an airwing for the Mistrals that Russia was supposed to receive). They also acquired two Il-76MFs from Jordan, noteworthy because these are custom lengthened versions and could possibly signal long term interest in the Il-76-MD-90A's, Egypt's transport fleet is lacking in heavy lift and high volume capacity, they're already trying to solve this with C-130 orders but they're likely to continue expanding on this in the future.\n\nThey also technically ordered the Su-35 but were then absolutely shafted by the US for doing so (to the degree where several countries were more or less forced by the threat of sanctions to drop their orders of the Su-35 and instead order American/Western. There's some political arguments and financial ones that could be made in benefit of America's position here, it was meant as a sanction package to target Iran/Russia/NK but it arguably utterly ***\\*failed\\****. It was performative political theatre and instead angered allies who were caught in rock/hardplace situations and the crossfire in regards to procurement and business ties.\n\nAnd the best part of all of it, is that the Su-35's which were *originally* supposed to be delivered to Egypt were already built and completed in preparation for delivery. **They are now instead going to Iran likely at bargain basement pricing and with little objection from the US who have absolutely zero power or control over this anymore**. The US have legitimately shot themselves in the foot with their own sanctions, the outcome of the package is entirely against the objective of the package, which was to limit arms procurement for Iran... And the sanctions functionally resulted in a batch of ready made fighters sitting unused and instead of being exported to a semi Ally such as Egypt, being exported to Iran... That's certainly one for the history books.   \n\n\nBut aside from that this is just some of the context that Egypt are dealing with when it comes to aircraft procurement. Expect to see many more announcements in the future as their F16 fleet nears retirement, Rafale and EF are just the start, soon enough we'll know more about their F15 acquisition (if things remain stable enough for this to continue) and we may also hear more news on Russian/Chinese acquisitions, Egypt have been threading the needle very carefully these last few months, it wouldn't surprise me if they're keeping their options open for a reason.",

Somalis make up the vast majority of people in the eastern province of Ethiopia and Somalia tried to annex this part of Ethiopia in the Ogaden War some decades ago, which caused it to lose its backing from the USSR/China and triggered the chain of events that have caused the country to remain as screwed up as it is today.\n\nIt's unclear how Somalis on either side of the border feel about each other.

At the same time Nasrallah promised a diplomatic solution and that Lebanon would even gain territory. He likely meant the Shebaa farms. A strip of land controlled by Israel, probably part of Syria but also claimed by Hezbollah as Lebanese. [https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-january-5-2024/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-january-5-2024/).\n\nToday the issue once again got traction. The US once again continued it policy of leaking secret assessments of its allies to the press.\n\n>A secret assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency casts doubts about Israel\u2019s prospects for success if it mounts a significant escalation against Hezbollah, saying IDF resources will be spread too thin given the war in Gaza, per sources  \n>  \n>U.S. officials remain concerned that Netanyahu may see an expanded fight in Lebanon as key to his political survival amid domestic criticism of his government\u2019s handling of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack\n\n[https://twitter.com/John\\_Hudson/status/1743903150166183944](https://twitter.com/John_Hudson/status/1743903150166183944)\n\nThis prompted veteran Israeli journalist (who is usually highly critical of official Israeli state policy) to push back:\n\n>The Israeli high intensity operation in Gaza is almost over. If Israel decides to go to war in Lebanon (which is a big if), it will shift most of the forces to the north and can do it pretty quickly. If the Pentagon doesn't know it, it's a problem\n\n[https://twitter.com/BarakRavid/status/1743993486196498440](https://twitter.com/BarakRavid/status/1743993486196498440)\n\nAnother Issue is that it was Netanyahu that stopped a large scale strike against Hezbollah during the early days of the conflict. One major reason to bring Gantz and Eizenkot into the goverment was to balance out Gallant and Halevi who both pushed for such a strike.\n\n>Hard to understand this outside of the context of the leaks from the Biden admin that they stopped \\*Bibi\\* from responding more strongly in Lebanon in October, when in reality it wasn't Bibi who was pushing for it. Is it the bottom-line intel assessment, or just more messaging?\n\n[https://twitter.com/LahavHarkov/status/1743962231354659116](https://twitter.com/LahavHarkov/status/1743962231354659116)\n\nI also find the strategy of intentionally leaking that you don't think your ally can defeat Hezbollah dubious if you want to bring about a diplomatic solution to the conflict (which is honestly not impossible to do). Why would Hezbollah be interested in negotiations or accept any deal that's not unacceptable to Israel if the US says: \"Yeah we don't think the Israelis can punish you anyway\". That's just bad negotiating and could also force Israel to strike to show: \"The US is wrong. We can punish terrorist organizations on our border\".\n\nI think we are also something similar in Gaza where some US analysts claim that Israel can't achieve its goals just to see Israel going: \"Watch me.\". The US seems to underestimate the Israeli willingness to pay a price.",

The US once again continued it policy of leaking secret assessments of its allies to the press.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A secret assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency casts doubts about Israel\u2019s prospects for success if it mounts a significant escalation against Hezbollah, saying IDF resources will be spread too thin given the war in Gaza, per sources  </p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials remain concerned that Netanyahu may see an expanded fight in Lebanon as key to his political survival amid domestic criticism of his government\u2019s handling of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/John_Hudson/status/1743903150166183944\">https://twitter.com/John_Hudson/status/1743903150166183944</a></p>\n\n<p>This prompted veteran Israeli journalist (who is usually highly critical of official Israeli state policy) to push back:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Israeli high intensity operation in Gaza is almost over. If Israel decides to go to war in Lebanon (which is a big if), it will shift most of the forces to the north and can do it pretty quickly. If the Pentagon doesn&#39;t know it, it&#39;s a problem</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarakRavid/status/1743993486196498440\">https://twitter.com/BarakRavid/status/1743993486196498440</a></p>\n\n<p>Another Issue is that it was Netanyahu that stopped a large scale strike against Hezbollah during the early days of the conflict. One major reason to bring Gantz and Eizenkot into the goverment was to balance out Gallant and Halevi who both pushed for such a strike.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hard to understand this outside of the context of the leaks from the Biden admin that they stopped *Bibi* from responding more strongly in Lebanon in October, when in reality it wasn&#39;t Bibi who was pushing for it. Is it the bottom-line intel assessment, or just more messaging?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LahavHarkov/status/1743962231354659116\">https://twitter.com/LahavHarkov/status/1743962231354659116</a></p>\n\n<p>I also find the strategy of intentionally leaking that you don&#39;t think your ally can defeat Hezbollah dubious if you want to bring about a diplomatic solution to the conflict (which is honestly not impossible to do). Why would Hezbollah be interested in negotiations or accept any deal that&#39;s not unacceptable to Israel if the US says: &quot;Yeah we don&#39;t think the Israelis can punish you anyway&quot;. That&#39;s just bad negotiating and could also force Israel to strike to show: &quot;The US is wrong. We can punish terrorist organizations on our border&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I think we are also something similar in Gaza where some US analysts claim that Israel can&#39;t achieve its goals just to see Israel going: &quot;Watch me.&quot;. The US seems to underestimate the Israeli willingness to pay a price.</p>\n</div>",

However, the happy medium was a unit who had been well trained, bloodied especially in a low cost manner to itself, where they become more confident with themselves, bold more, work out the kinks, learn the various mission specific variables to their time and place, and become better at their jobs, whatever it is (but usually involving killing their fellow man). </p>\n\n<p>They key is not to overexpose to battle, because that causes lots of harm. At this point, most of the combatants in the Russo-Ukraine War have been overexposed, used more callously than they were supposed to, ordered to fight for too long, not given enough breaks, not prepared well enough to start with, etc.</p>\n</div>",
