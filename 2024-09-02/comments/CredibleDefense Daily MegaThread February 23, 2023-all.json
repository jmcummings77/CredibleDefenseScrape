This gives us 124/134 years of subjugation under crests of black eagles.  \nDuring that time Germany and Russia enforce policies of colonisation and ethnic cleansing local population (Poles/Tatars).\n\nIn 1917, Poles make 64% of population of Wielkopolska, Crimeans make 50% population of Crimea.\n\nNext ethnic cleansing happens during WW2, Germans banish over quarter million of Poles, and also kill 70.000 Poles and 280.000 Polish Jews (1939-1945). Russians banish 200.000 Tatars, leading to 25% of population dying during 4 years of deportations (1944-1948).  \n\n\nPoland, despite enormous casualties, rivaled only by people of Lithuania and White Rhutenia - was reborn as a homogenous  Soviet satellite, Wielkopolska as core part of it; remnants of Polish Jews were expelled by communists in late 60s. Lithuanians lost their country, White Rhutenians were united in Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and russification continued.\n\nTatar Crimea was destroyed, with 200.000 Crimean Tatars returning since Soviet Union started wobbling on its last legs. Instead of being 50% of Crimeans, now they've become a minority in Crimea for the first time since hundreds of years, with 2.000.000 Slavs vastly outnumbering them.  \n\n\nAnyway, the point is - Wielkopolska survived due to sheer luck and Axis losing the war. \n\nTatar Crimea died, and I'd argue that Crimea nowadays is not Russian *de iure/de historia*, not Ukrainian *de facto/de historia*, not Crimean Tatar *de iure/de facto*.  \n\n\nHow to resolve current situation?

If I were to produce the most just way that hurts Crimea inhabitants the least, it would be a sort of Bosnian-state solution and repatriation of Ukrainians/Tatars, expulsion of Russians that came after 2014, and constitutional guarantees for Ukrainians and Tatars - but this is plain dumb, and not credible territory.  \n\n\nAnyway, main point of the story is - history is extremely complex and ambiguous, so please stop with these nonsensical and extremely shallow arguments in /r/CredibleDefense, you are not contributing to the discussion in a meaningful manner...",

If I were to produce the most just way that hurts Crimea inhabitants the least, it would be a sort of Bosnian-state solution and repatriation of Ukrainians/Tatars, expulsion of Russians that came after 2014, and constitutional guarantees for Ukrainians and Tatars - but this is plain dumb, and not credible territory.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, main point of the story is - history is extremely complex and ambiguous, so please stop with these nonsensical and extremely shallow arguments in <a href=\"/r/CredibleDefense\">/r/CredibleDefense</a>, you are not contributing to the discussion in a meaningful manner...</p>\n</div>",

They knew a massive portion of Russian army was in Crimea, Americans were sharing info, there really isn&#39;t an excuse for what happened.</p>\n</div>",

The final outcome remains to be seen. Authoritarian regimes can engage in mass wars without being \"fascist\" per se and in this case I don't see the massive social transformation of political life in Russia. The key difference is that fascist states use the power of the state to encroach upon *every* aspect of life, empowering and coopting institutions to do their bidding. The Nazi Party had *millions* of members and was the defining civic, social, economic, and legal apparatus of society. It was quite literally omnipresent in a way that Putin's Russia, with its limited state capacity just *isn't*. Putin coopts institutions to hollow them out and weaken them, discouraging civic participation across the board.\n\nAnother key difference is the distinct *lack* of ideology. Sure one might argue that being \"anti-west\" or \"anti-LGBTQ\" for example constitutes an ideology, and we certainly have the *elements* of something that might become an ideology.. but a couple of eggs, flour, and sugar don't make a cake.. Putin's Russia has no defining ideology, no coherent, cohesive political narrative that runs through society and provides a *vision* for the future. There's a reason why fascism is inherently modern and revolutionary and part of that is the idea of societal transformation.. Putin, by contrast, is a run-of-the-mill imperialist merely attempting to maximize the power of himself and the Russian state. \n\nThe Ukraine war may transform Russia into something resembling 21st century fascism, and there are some signs - but key ingredients are still missing and it's going to take some pretty radical changes in Russian society to produce that. Not impossible, but we're still a ways off.\n\nNot that this really *matters*, ultimately if you're drafted into a brutal war by a repressive, authoritarian regime the distinction of whether or not it's \"fascist\" probably matters little.",

Three reasons:\n\n* First, Russians culturally view Ukrainians as uneducated peasants, viewpoint predates Soviet Union.

Contrasts mobilized personnel and prisoners with UAF soldiers motivated to defend their homes. Creative use of technology as result of good morale and motivated soldiers, quadcopter innovations and software designed for personal phones to help with air defense and or reporting enemy movement as examples. \n* Specific claim about poor Russian maintenance leading to high failure rate of Kalibr missiles.

Cannot reduce rate further to preserve stockpiles. \n* West failed to ramp up production over the course of the year. \n* Calls out countries reserving stocks for their own security, contrasts to Denmark, Estonia, and Finland who are willing to empty stockpiles of at least certain systems. Says \"big\" Germany on the other hand is less willing. \n* Emphasizes point that military aid to Ukraine is military aid to European security since Russia is virtually the only real threat right now. \n* Russian rhetoric portrays war as against the West generally and NATO.

Yellow ribbon movement visible all over Crimea. Russian citizens uncomfortable in Crimea. Ukrainians in Crimea acting as intelligence network.

Ukrainian strategy has frequently spent the lives of their soldiers in an apparently wasteful manner. The fighting in and around Severodonetsk comes to mind immediately. The fact that this claim is used to justify the statement that the Kharkiv and Kherson offensives were staggered when in fact they occurred concurrently, starting only a few days apart is also telling.</p>\n</div>",

But they still considered themselves Serbs. And it went on.

And in his most famous work [The Mountain Wreath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Wreath) calls for Serbian Unity and strength.\n\n\nWhen the Serbia gained the independence from Ottomans there was this idea of all south Slavs coming together in a single country and it came about with creation of Kingdom of Yugoslavia after WW1. It had its problems, mainly due to Serbs being in favor of more centralized organization of country, and Croats mostly being in favor of more regionalized country with more powers given to each nationality. After WW2, Yugoslavia became a socialist country and its leaders drew internal borders of republics. And now this might be bit controversial, but Serbs were the most populous ethnicity and they will say that those borders were drawn in such way as to reduce the Serbian power inside Yugoslavia, and there is famous saying \"Weak Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia\". Now there is some truth to this, but I believe it is overused by nationalist in Serbia blaming socialist government of Yugoslavia.

This is a temporary setup, with \"proper\" terminals currently in the planning stage.\n\nSo far, only one of the FSRUs (the \"H\u00f6egh Esperanza\") is working at full capacity in Wilhelmshaven and processing about 1 LNG delivery per week (about \\~1 TWh per week). Another FSRU (the \"Neptune\") has been moored near Lubmin for quite some time, but it's still not at full capacity. So far it has only regasified about 1 ship delivery, I believe \\~1 TWh.

Currently there are 108 Taiwanese, 75 Australian, and 336 Polish Abrams that are in line as well as roughly 100 Army Abrams (which was half the requested) over the next 4 years. So that's roughly 620 Abrams over the next 4 years, which is about the same as its current construction capacity over that time. Add in the already committed 31 Abrams, and it's about 4.5 years of capacity. \n\nSo let's say with funding - and barring logistics/hiring issues - it can double that production, and adding a third shift produce even more. So let's say they go from 150 to 300 to 375 produced per year by Jan 1, 2024. Sounds great, right? Knock out Taiwan and Australia's orders in 2023, and start doing  Poland's and Ukraine's in late 2023 2024. Gives Ukraine time that they can train and integrate over late 2023 and early 2024 as they slowly get supplied\n\nBut the question is: what then? The US has spent all this money to increase production, and now has fulfilled all its paying customers with only Ukraine as a not paying customer left. There's no guarantee they'll get more customers to make that production amount worthwhile. There's no large user of Abrams tanks outside the US that would be a constant customer, and looking around I don't know who could become one. \n\nUkraine won't be paying for purchasing or maintenance of the tanks during the war, or likely even after it. That means the more Abrams the US supplies to Ukraine, the more Abrams the US will be required to maintain, and they won't even own them. \n\nSo what does the US do now it's got a tank plant that's even a bigger cost on the budget and a new not-light tank to procure? Downgrade the production capacity? Could create a parts shortage and definitely won't be politically well received. See if it can speed run upgrading all its stored Abrams? Even more money since who will they sell them to? See if they can force GDLS to make the MPF there? Maybe - Wormuth did mention they'll make the turret there. \n\nSo the trade off to spending money to vastly increase production only for it to fall off a cliff in two years likely is deemed not worth it.",

So let&#39;s say they go from 150 to 300 to 375 produced per year by Jan 1, 2024. Sounds great, right? Knock out Taiwan and Australia&#39;s orders in 2023, and start doing  Poland&#39;s and Ukraine&#39;s in late 2023 2024. Gives Ukraine time that they can train and integrate over late 2023 and early 2024 as they slowly get supplied</p>\n\n<p>But the question is: what then? The US has spent all this money to increase production, and now has fulfilled all its paying customers with only Ukraine as a not paying customer left. There&#39;s no guarantee they&#39;ll get more customers to make that production amount worthwhile. There&#39;s no large user of Abrams tanks outside the US that would be a constant customer, and looking around I don&#39;t know who could become one. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine won&#39;t be paying for purchasing or maintenance of the tanks during the war, or likely even after it. That means the more Abrams the US supplies to Ukraine, the more Abrams the US will be required to maintain, and they won&#39;t even own them. </p>\n\n<p>So what does the US do now it&#39;s got a tank plant that&#39;s even a bigger cost on the budget and a new not-light tank to procure? Downgrade the production capacity? Could create a parts shortage and definitely won&#39;t be politically well received. See if it can speed run upgrading all its stored Abrams? Even more money since who will they sell them to? See if they can force GDLS to make the MPF there? Maybe - Wormuth did mention they&#39;ll make the turret there. </p>\n\n<p>So the trade off to spending money to vastly increase production only for it to fall off a cliff in two years likely is deemed not worth it.</p>\n</div>",

That's around 104k soldiers at full strength. Assuming a mere 1/3 are on the front line at any given time, that means there are 35k in the trenches.
