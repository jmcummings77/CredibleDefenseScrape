Even now, the Antonovsky bridges are about within range of 155mm tube artillery from the frontline. Combining that with HIMARS and they might very well cut off a lot of Russian equipment. The trick would be keeping enough pressure on the west though that the Russians cannot disengage there. It will be obvious to everyone that taking the city head on is not the ideal route.",

You could put up a temporary structure in the parking lot of a museum or something and have ok logistics and guarantee collateral damage if struck. </p>\n\n<p>They could also just brute force distribute to many small locations, which makes these not even worth striking but complicates logistics a lot by increasing tracking complexity, guard requirements, loading labor requirements, etc\u2026 my assumption was they\u2019d just do that. </p>\n\n<p>Someone who actually has a good understanding of the types of buildings and era of construction in these cities could speculate a lot better. I\u2019m guessing very abstractly.</p>\n</div>",

I hate to sound a doomsayer, but I am more and more thinking that we might indeed hading for some big collapse, war, femine, plague etc. Just because of the greed of the few and the stupidity of many.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I wanted to say, if you have a nation with 10+ million citizens, you will find some ppl there who tell you that the earth is round and hollow. And you can read about their shit on the internet! Nothing new, just with fancy communication</p>\n\n<p>Edit - Sorry, actually I think the social engineering aspect from different groups on the cyber space speading fake news and what not is actually a new thing that might very well help with you feeling what you do</p>\n</div>",

There is no such thing in the Russian military, especially Ground Forces and Airborne, where officers are still \"lords of their manor,\" with total authority and responsibilities to do nearly all the thinking, planning, training, etc, with the NCOs only helping but mostly just to run herd on the junior enlisted. Russian junior officers are expected to be THE subject matter experts in the units they command from the day they arrive as junior lieutenants. \n\nAnd MANY have become casualties in Ukraine. Can they be replaced? \n\nTossing rubles at a 50 year old former conscript to do a 4-6 month combat deployment in Ukraine might work to replace junior enlisted grunts or tankers but that can't replace officers. Even battlefield commissioning capable junior enlisted or NCOs is problematic, they're not trained on what an officer is required to know to do their jobs. Russia only produces their officers 4-5 year service academies. AFAIK, there was no dramatic expansion opening up more, no early graduations, etc.\n\nIf the Russian combat arms keep losing their best and brightest without the ability to replace them, they're screwed on not only offensive ops but when it comes down to defensive ops as well.

There is no such thing in the Russian military, especially Ground Forces and Airborne, where officers are still &quot;lords of their manor,&quot; with total authority and responsibilities to do nearly all the thinking, planning, training, etc, with the NCOs only helping but mostly just to run herd on the junior enlisted. Russian junior officers are expected to be THE subject matter experts in the units they command from the day they arrive as junior lieutenants. </p>\n\n<p>And MANY have become casualties in Ukraine. Can they be replaced? </p>\n\n<p>Tossing rubles at a 50 year old former conscript to do a 4-6 month combat deployment in Ukraine might work to replace junior enlisted grunts or tankers but that can&#39;t replace officers. Even battlefield commissioning capable junior enlisted or NCOs is problematic, they&#39;re not trained on what an officer is required to know to do their jobs. Russia only produces their officers 4-5 year service academies. AFAIK, there was no dramatic expansion opening up more, no early graduations, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If the Russian combat arms keep losing their best and brightest without the ability to replace them, they&#39;re screwed on not only offensive ops but when it comes down to defensive ops as well. Killing or wounding more of them likely won&#39;t cause a collapse, but it will cause a degradation of capabilities enough that they&#39;ll suffer crisis after crisis down the road.</p>\n</div>",

Obstacles loom.*\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/07/14/yellen-putin-oil-price-russia/\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen was feted by Japan\u2019s leaders after arriving here on Sunday, lunching with the country\u2019s top economists, meeting with senior executives from Sony and Panasonic and lighting incense at the wake of former prime minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nBut beneath the public bonhomie, Yellen\u2019s hosts quietly expressed concerns about potential fallout from her push to create a new global price cap on Russian oil. Japanese officials have communicated that they are worried that Russia could retaliate to the price cap by restricting natural gas exports to Japan, a senior Treasury official said, damaging the country\u2019s economy at an already precarious moment.\n\nYellen tried assuring the Japanese the United States will help meet its energy needs. But she still must persuade many international colleagues that her plan to diminish Russia\u2019s massive revenue from energy sales won\u2019t destabilize the global economy. After visiting Japan, Yellen flew on Wednesday to Indonesia for meetings of finance ministers from the Group of 20 industrialized nations, where she will attempt to rally a much broader swath of countries to pledge to buy Russian oil only at a discount rate.\n\nIf successful, her campaign could deliver a major blow to Russia\u2019s war effort and help prevent the United States and the rest of the world from plunging into economic recession. If not, the West could continue sending billions to Russia or face skyrocketing energy prices that trigger a global recession. Soaring energy prices this year have already hammered economies in the United States and elsewhere, contributing heavily to a new 40-year high that U.S. inflation reached in June.\n\nYellen thinks she has a solution. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two motivations: to deprive Russia of revenue to the maximum extent possible to impair their ability to wage war against Ukraine, and to shield the global economy from the adverse impacts of the war,\u201d Yellen told The Washington Post on Wednesday in an interview while traveling between Japan and Indonesia.\n\nRussia\u2019s tax revenue 'will increase significantly to more than $180 billion'\n\nThis story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people, several of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of private diplomatic conversations. They include U.S. and European government officials and other domestic and international experts briefed on the Treasury Department\u2019s lobbying blitz for the price cap.\n\nThe campaign began with a private dinner in April attended by the world\u2019s most powerful economic leaders, overcame initial unease from other parts of the Biden administration, and now is turning to focus on international leaders beyond America\u2019s closest allies.\n\nYellen\u2019s high-stakes standoff with Moscow could have enormous consequences \u2014 for the war effort, for the U.S. and global economies, and, potentially, for the personal legacy of America\u2019s first female treasury secretary.\n\nAlready, Putin has stoked fears he could respond to the price cap by slashing energy exports. International competitors such as India and China could step in and buy Russian oil above the price cap, depleting the West\u2019s energy supply even as Russia continues to make money. And, at least for now, major questions remain unsettled about how the price cap would be implemented.\n\nUntangling these diplomatic knots will fall to Yellen. Stymied in many of her top priorities both domestically and internationally, the treasury secretary has been absorbed in rallying the world to her proposal. That has made the bookish former chair of the Federal Reserve an unlikely commander in the West\u2019s economic war \u2014 a macroeconomist marshaling forces on the financial battlefield.\n\n\u201cIf it succeeds, if it even partly succeeds, and you manage to eat at Russia\u2019s revenue \u2014 that\u2019s a huge deal,\u201d said Daniel Fried, who served on the National Security Council under prior administrations and is now at the Atlantic Council, a D.C.-based think tank. \u201cThere are enormous, enormous risks. But there\u2019s a lot to be gained, if you can manage it.\u201d\n\nYellen\u2019s pitch began in April\n\nOn the night of April 21, as the West weighed its next move to counter Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, Yellen gathered some the world\u2019s most powerful financial leaders together for a private dinner in Washington.\n\nThe obvious potential moves all appeared to have huge risks. Russia continued to earn billions of dollars in energy sales despite U.S. and European efforts to impose an unparalleled sanctions regime on the Kremlin. Before the war, Russia was shipping out roughly 3 million barrels a day of crude oil. But demand for energy soared as the world rebounded from covid, and that number moved closer to 4 million barrels a day, according to Simon Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who served as chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. In an attempt to contain prices, the West exempted energy from sanctions, and continued purchases of Russian oil were undermining its pledges to stand in solidarity with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky begged the allies to immediately stop buying oil from Putin.\n\nAs they began to work toward a sixth sanctions package this spring, European officials discussed targeting the insurance firms that underwrite tankers hauling Russian oil \u2014 the vast majority of which are British or in the European Union. Stripping insurance from ships carrying Russian oil would prevent them from accessing some international waterways, while also undercutting the financing necessary for transporting the oil.\n\nBut in internal analyses, Treasury staff found such a move could cause the price of oil to soar past $150 per barrel and keep rising, two people familiar with the matter said. (It recently peaked around $120 a barrel but has since fallen closer to $100.) Worst-case scenarios suggested price shocks could be even higher. A senior Treasury official said estimates showed roughly 3 to 5 million barrels a day of Russian oil could be closed off from global energy markets. The United States could face a 1970s-style oil shock, and what had started as a limited energy crunch could drag down the world economy. Up to that point, Yellen had been publicly confident that the war wouldn\u2019t pull the United States into recession. But if Europe went through with the ban on insurance firms, that calculus could change.\n\nTreasury officials had already begun discussing the idea of a price cap when the Europeans started pushing their insurance ban. Treasury aides realized that the insurance ban could be an ideal mechanism for implementing the price cap proposal, giving them a vital chokepoint in the Russian oil supply chain. \u201cThere was always the question of: \u2018How do you implement the price cap?,\u201d Yellen told The Post. \u201cThis was a great enforcement mechanism.\u201d\n\nYellen made her first major pitch to the economic leaders of the Group of Seven allies when they gathered over short ribs in the Treasury Department\u2019s second-floor dining room, which overlooks the White House. Simply cutting off exports of Russian oil to the West could backfire, Yellen warned. Rather than deprive the Russian war machine of revenue, that move could drive up the price of oil \u2014 meaning Moscow would make even more money than it did before. The sanctions also risked devastating Western economies by starving them of energy, Yellen cautioned, creating a domestic political backlash that could undermine support for the war.\n\nWhen Yellen pitched the price cap instead, some finance ministers had immediate questions about how it could work. But Yellen maintained that this plan could allow the West to solve a vexing financial and diplomatic puzzle, allowing Russian oil to flow while also reducing the Kremlin\u2019s single biggest source of revenue. The ministers began to talk.\n\nYellen dispatched top aides for a global campaign\n\nYellen\u2019s plan faced skepticism both at home and abroad. State Department and Energy Department officials were initially lukewarm to it, according to two people briefed on internal administration deliberations. Energy aides were concerned about the potential for Russian oil to go outside official channels, which would make it harder to track, the people said. (An Energy official said in a statement that the department \u201ccarefully reviews every policy that we generate or that we are asked to analyze by other parts of the government\u201d but that it is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the effort. State Department officials have also now joined the diplomatic push for the cap.)\n\nSome European officials also initially chafed at the idea. Germany was already struggling to persuade E.U. allies to back the phased-in oil embargo. The price cap was first seen as a potential distraction from that effort. (Treasury officials have defended the cap as a way to augment, rather than replace, the oil ban, trying to not dictate the Europeans\u2019 decisions.)",

I have a feeling there is no central HQ allocating them, but every military district makes their own target calls. Which is why the southern coast is almost never hit by Iskanders (the Black Sea Fleet is in charge of that area and they have no Iskanders). They use Kalibrs, and anti-ship missiles when they need something hit in a hurry.\n\nIn the north the Western district seems to have no shortage of Iskanders and even uses them for tactical strikes.",

He is talking to a Russian audience and he just says - look, Belgorod Iskanders on their way to Kharkiv again.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there are often videos of launches from Belgorod like this one <a href=\"https://t.me/boris_rozhin/56314\">https://t.me/boris_rozhin/56314</a></p>\n\n<p>There is something strange with the Russian use of Kalibrs and Iskanders. I have a feeling there is no central HQ allocating them, but every military district makes their own target calls. Which is why the southern coast is almost never hit by Iskanders (the Black Sea Fleet is in charge of that area and they have no Iskanders). They use Kalibrs, and anti-ship missiles when they need something hit in a hurry.</p>\n\n<p>In the north the Western district seems to have no shortage of Iskanders and even uses them for tactical strikes.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "> How much are China's oil reserves? Is it enough to support years of a US blockade of the Malacca straits?\n\nThis actually becomes quite a complicated problem. \n\nSo China isn't looking at this war this year. But they are looking at Taiwan as a long term goal. And the USA can project power out to Taiwan because the USA has a very very strong navy and Air force. A Navy with multiple aircraft carriers, good fast attack submarines, good surface warfare ships, and support from an air force that has land bases in the region (Philippines and Okinawa). \n\nA conflict between the USA/Taiwan and China would come down to who can with the sea/air battle. If China is able to knock out a large amount of the USA's sea/air capability to where the USA cannot establish air/sea dominance over Taiwan, China wins. China actually doesn't need air dominance, just has to deny the USA/Taiwan air/sea dominance because China can then send a million of soldiers over the strait. They'll need roughly a million soldiers to effectively keep Taiwan. 500k to occupy it and probably 500k for support and losses. That's AFTER the conflict. Taiwan has a standing military of 160k which would probably swell to close to a million if China invaded. That means that China would need close to 2 million soldiers to complete the invasion. \n\nTaiwan will be similar to Ukraine in that every indication is that Taiwan will fight hard. They will not roll over like Iraq. They know full well what China is capable of and I'd venture that most Taiwanese people would rather die than live under the PRC. \n\nIf you think of the conflict that way, it becomes a very very close conflict. Because China has the advantage in location. They need simpler weapons in that they can use Anti-ship missiles and SAMs in order to project power. That is A LOT cheaper than the weapons that the USA can produce. \n\nOn the other side, the USA/Taiwan have a homefield advantage along with the Taiwan Strait. Occupying a country is hard and Taiwan would be very very bitter in defense. Additionally, Taiwan has a strong economy that can support many many advanced weapons. Backstop that with the USA's strong navy and air force and getting 500k soldiers across the straight is simply not possible right now. China's navy and soldiers that make it to Taiwan would be decimated.\n\nAbout the China economy, I think most people overestimate China's economy because they see how many people they have. A large population gives you advantages and disadvantages. The advantage being more manpower. The disadvantage being China is way more vulnerable to supply/food/water shortages than the USA. These aspects become very very important in a climate change environment where the USA and allies supply most of the world's food. \n\nThe last aspect of this conflict is that China is similar to Russia in that they don't care about the people in Taiwan. They are not there to do anything than to bully the country into submission. They only need to stop Taiwan from being successful. So China could just decimate the island using conventional weapons. And that will be in line with their own goals. The downside with that approach is that China needs the USA more than the USA needs China. So if that were the case, China's economy would be trashed. That said, if China goes down the same road as Russia - dictatorship - there is a good chance that in a few decades China no longer has a strong economy and will be suffering with a substandard military and an unhappy population. War might be a tool for the dictatorship to keep their thumb on the population. Just like in Russia.",
