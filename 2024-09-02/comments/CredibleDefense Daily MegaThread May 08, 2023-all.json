The US may have broken the rules, but it also didn\u2019t violate them in as much as the conquest distinction can be drawn.

He referenced the Iraq War, where America toppled the standing government, compared it to annexation, and asked if Russia stuck to only regime change, would their war be less objectionable. \n\nThe author references the \"no-conquest norm\", and says while atrocities and violence were occurring, Russia's land seizures broke the norm. He uses that to argue against the people claiming the 'rules-based international order\" was either dead or never truly existed. I can't speak for other comments that you claim point out things never mentioned in the article. But I don't understand the framework he's trying to push. The Soviet Union never annexed territories after WW2 but would topple governments and install puppet ones, enforce communist rule on their client states, and would do everything short of directly annexing nations to maintain their power. While the US wasn't as bad as Russia, they still showcase a complete disregard for another nations sovereignty. He's trying to differentiate the US's and Soviet Union's actions from Nazi Germany's and Imperial Japan's to argue that Russia has gone too far. But arguments boils down to Russia dropping the fa\u00e7ade that everyone else attempted to maintain. If Russia had simply stuck to regime change, the author's narrative would fall apart as the \"no conquest norm\" wasn't broken. That's why he has to define what makes directly annexing worse than indirect ones (regime change, puppet govt, etc) or pick another argument.",

Usurpation \\ annexation of Ukraine in one form or another was basically decided by the Russian deep state in 1991, right after the break up of the USSR. The breakup part was not really planned as you might guess. That's another story entirely. But first the plans to \"reintegrate\" Ukraine were solely political, it was thought that it could be done through elites (e.g. Kuchma and the oligarchs). It didn't work (First Maidan of 2004). After this a more aggressive approach was selected (by this time Putin secured his grip fully and dictated the deep state). The plan was a two-pronged operation, focusing first on political overtaking (through Yanukovich and bought oligarchs) and if it didn't work - turning Ukraine into a failed state that would be sliced apart through manufactured unrest in the East and Crimea. As you might guess this plan has stuck so much that it *still* holds in some form to this date. This might mean that the original plan was authored directly by Putin.\n\nThe whole thing was further complicated by the inner political machinations of criminal \\ oligarch elites within pre-2014 Ukraine, many of whom kind of knew where it was going and that in the end they would be discarded as tools. This somewhat stalled \\ slowed the process. These inner political machinations alone need a couple of thick tomes to explain. The final part of the preparations were set on 2012-2015, with the focus on political actions (mass overtaking of power structures of Ukraine, focusing on the police \\ judicial and local administration). 2013 was really the darkest year, I remember the fell mood of despair in the country pretty well at the time. Donetsk \\ Russian Mafia basically crusaded to take over everything they could as far as Western Ukraine, I have lots of personal examples and anecdotes. Simultaneously the fifth column was created or reinforced - be it L\\DNR organizations (est. ~2010, most of the preparatory work in 2012-2013), or pro-russian separatist actors in Crimea. Kremlin-appointed Defense Ministers were methodically dismantling the Armed Forces of Ukraine, especialy in the last two years under Lebedev. \n\nThe climax was set to be in 2015 as a conclusion of 2015 Presidential Elections. The unrest (aka second Maidan) was guaranteed, and it would be a pretext for the cascade of the now known operations starting from Crimea, moving to South-East Ukraine regions. Since in this timeline Yanuk retains power, he would sign off everything and remain as a criminal gauleiter of the Ukrainian rump state until the Kremlin decided otherwise. But it all went a little bit south when the things started moving much faster, with the EU association protests turned into a real second Maidan a whole year sooner than expected. The scale and sheer magnitude of the protests was also severely miscalculated.\n\nKremlin was able to hastily start and successfully finish off Crimean operation (the best prepared), but in the East they had to first hastily arm their fifth column (both l\\dnr as well as local bought criminal lords such as Zakharchenko). Again they didn't expect the Ukrainian army to resist and rapidly reorganize under new leadership in 2014. Thus the Summer invasion was another hasty operation, the Russian Army units were not even informed until the last minute, so the readiness was low and only about a dozen reinforced battalions could be mustered. \n\nBy 2015 they significantly increased active amount of troops committed. but the russian army still suffered from the low readiness, hence it was easier to just fill l\\dnr troops with the russian officers and specialists. Heavy (by that standard of the day) fighting exhausted both sides, and Minsk ceasefires were set as a timeout. (mind that localized heavy fighting was going throughout 2015 to late 2016).\n\nIt is fairly obvious in the hindsight that the current events were planned and set in motion in 2015-2016. Planned again were familiar two-pronged actions, a political operation as well as a methodical preparation for the new military campaign. Again, there were quarrels within Putin's circle on the actual implementation. But the final decision to invade was made probably in late 2015, once it became obvious that Ukraine's government and economy stabilized, and after the scapegoats were found in the Kremlin fractions responsible for botching the first try (e.g. Surkov and others).\n\nThere is a lot more to say about all of this, but perhaps after the war, when more will be publicly revealed.",

A podcast I thought might be of interest to users in this forum that I haven't heard mentioned here before is *A History of Europe, Key Battles.* This has excellent calm narration and goes through the history of Europe chronologically, using key battles as the framework for introducing different eras and important turning points. I recommend starting at the first episode (The Battle of Marathon, 490 BC). One battle story that stood out was the ambush of the Romans at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD which reminded me of the '40 km column' of Russians during the initial attack on Kyiv. The Romans did not maintain readiness and stretched their force too far along the road where they were then destroyed. I also learned, in a different battle episode, that the city of \"Kandahar\" is actually etymologically related to \"Alexander\" and also to \"Iskander\" -- which might be well known aby users here already and completely betray my ignorance.\n\n2. What are some creative curveball options that are available to different actors in the Ukraine conflict? Some ideas to demonstrate the concept:\n\n* A US nuclear deal with Iran contingent on Iran producing oil at high levels against OPEC/Russian interests\n* Sending/allowing a buildup of western civilians in Ukraine in certain cities to change the target scape. For example (not a well developed example but bear with me), allowing a hypothetical large, high-profile, Catholic mission staffed by many Europeans and South Americans to Odessa to take care of children which would make the chances of an inadvertent escalatory attack by Russia there untenable and reduce the need for some air defense in Odessa.\n* Fomenting unrest in distant Russian holdings\n* Democrats making a deal with Republicans to trade tax cuts in exchange for some incredible anti-Russian bill\n* European labeling initiative for products by % of production in countries that support Russian aggression\n* A Western announcement of Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea that counters any implicit nuclear red line from Russia with an explicit preemptory dismissal by the West\n\n3. What are the major items of negotiation on the table and how would you weight them in a point-based system (however unwieldy this may be):\n\n* Possession of the Donbas (example: 10 points)\n* Possession of Crimea\n* $300b of frozen Russian reserves\n* Sanctions on Russian economy worth $X billion/year\n* The removal of Vladimir Putin\n* Nato membership for Ukraine\n* EU membership for Ukraine\n* Others? \n\n4. What, in your opinion, would have been the upper and lower range of outcomes for Russia if Putin had taken a cooperative, pro-Western (values and policy) approach for Russia during his reign? With the exception of abdicating his own power, of course. I am especially interested in how pro-Putin users would answer this. Maybe this is best answered by mapping one or two countries that did choose this route onto Russia's own unique situation and thinking about how the results would be similar/different and what those results were.\n\n5. Are there any examples of Western intelligence agencies unmasking anonymous/pseudonymous online accounts of pro-Russian propogandists? It seems like this would be an interesting deterrent, especially for foreign users who aren't necessarily protected by Western laws.\n\n6. What categories of wars are useful for thinking about duration statistics related to the Ukraine conflict? The current year has lasted just over a year and there are many who see the parties as far apart from a settlement position (even though many things in life are like bankruptcies -- slow and then sudden). What wars have the same background of impetus, scale, etc and what does the duration data for this bracket of conflicts tell us about likely ranges and likely catalysts for falling into one of those ranges?",

With the exception of abdicating his own power, of course. I am especially interested in how pro-Putin users would answer this. Maybe this is best answered by mapping one or two countries that did choose this route onto Russia's own unique situation and thinking about how the results would be similar/different and what those results were.\n\nA pro-Putin user today would argue that he *did* take a pro-Western approach and in return the West attempted to expand NATO to his very doorstep via Georgia and Ukraine, forcing the military counterplay which kept them outside of the alliance. A particularly nationalistic one would argue that the West will *always* seek to suppress, exploit, and destroy a powerful and sovereign Russia as it did in the world wars, the crimean war, and the Napoleonic war and so the only question for a Russia that wants to be sovereign is *where* the battlefield will lie, not *whether* there will be one.\n\nTo some extent it's impossible to separate out Russia's system of concentrated power in the presidency from its options, so if you are positing an actual democracy where people are meaningfully able to choose their rulers - Putin would be out of power.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>What, in your opinion, would have been the upper and lower range of outcomes for Russia if Putin had taken a cooperative, pro-Western (values and policy) approach for Russia during his reign? With the exception of abdicating his own power, of course. I am especially interested in how pro-Putin users would answer this. Maybe this is best answered by mapping one or two countries that did choose this route onto Russia&#39;s own unique situation and thinking about how the results would be similar/different and what those results were.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A pro-Putin user today would argue that he <em>did</em> take a pro-Western approach and in return the West attempted to expand NATO to his very doorstep via Georgia and Ukraine, forcing the military counterplay which kept them outside of the alliance. A particularly nationalistic one would argue that the West will <em>always</em> seek to suppress, exploit, and destroy a powerful and sovereign Russia as it did in the world wars, the crimean war, and the Napoleonic war and so the only question for a Russia that wants to be sovereign is <em>where</em> the battlefield will lie, not <em>whether</em> there will be one.</p>\n\n<p>To some extent it&#39;s impossible to separate out Russia&#39;s system of concentrated power in the presidency from its options, so if you are positing an actual democracy where people are meaningfully able to choose their rulers - Putin would be out of power.

This is something I only bring up because Putin has been notably brittle with regard to taking risk to his person, Ukraine has launched what are likely drone attacks towards targets in Southern Russia + Crimea over the last few days, and the recent context of the Kremlin drone attack.\n\nIf, hypothetically, I were Ukraine and I wanted to disrupt the May 9th parade, I'd probably launch as many mid-size (i.e., the type that carried out the Kremlin bombing last week) fixed-wing drones as I can muster right before Victory Day festivities are supposed to start. 50-100 drones would light up air defense systems like a Christmas tree. Even if say 75% of the drone wave gets taken out by each layer of air defenses, a) there's still a good chance a handful get through to Moscow and b) better yet, Putin might feel compelled to bail on the ceremony mid-speech if he thinks a few RC airplanes with a kilogram of well-earned hate might actually hit Red Square while he's in the open. The reaction over the last few days from Western countries regarding the Kremlin attack has been \"We don't know for sure if it was Ukraine, and even if it was, then [good for her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pGV2HnS0v8).\" Since the parade is mostly military personnel, tanks, and the civilian leadership directly responsible for the war, as previously discussed in the daily thread it's a completely fair target.",
