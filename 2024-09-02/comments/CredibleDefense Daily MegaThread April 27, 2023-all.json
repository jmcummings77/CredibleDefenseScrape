For a future fight against the Belarusian government.\n* He left the Legion and joined an independent volunteer unit. Also to finally get some proper missions. \n* Communication was often an issue.

But they\u2019re lucky the Russians are often incompetent. \n* examples of Russian incompetence: no RPGs used against Humvees, no sentries, everyone sleeps, surrender quickly \n* Spetznaz GRU is often made up of 90% old mobiks, but has great equipment. \n* 100 VDV with 2 BMD-4 beaten by 40 guys in humvees. \n*  Was injured by a grenade dropped from a quadcopter drone. He had noticed the drone beforehand. Still has fragments all over inside his body. Medical care was immediate and he had to be operated on. He made a full recovery. \n* Hasn\u2019t experienced friendly fire. \n* Russian war crimes: Russian Bombardment of civilian areas like in Irpin. Dead civilians in Bucha. \n* Ukrainian war crimes: Ukrainians didn\u2019t treat prisoners well. Demeaning and humiliating treatment like making them say Putin Huilo. Also physical assault. Videos of that are shared among troops and officers. Spontaneous executions. But Ukrainians investigated the executions. Results of investigations are unknown.\n* Women in the legion slept around and that lead to a lot of drama. \n* Loved the Ukrainian soldiers and their loyalty and solidarity. \n* Ukrainians loved foreign volunteers. Locals delivered coffee to trenches. \n* Food was really bad and not enough sometimes. 30 year Soviet MREs and also donated international MREs. Food donated by local civilians was often essential. \n* Food was really bad and lacking sometimes. 30 year Soviet MREs and also donated international MREs. Food donated by local civilians was often essential. \n* Bundeswehr training was very good and made him better trained compared to ZSU soldiers. \n* Ukrainian soldiers are trained to a low standard. \n* Some mistrust towards leadership because of doubts about ability. Information and data given to superiors ended up on the internet. \n* NLAW and javelins are rare. Other RPGs, anti tank launchers, and infantry ammunition was plentiful. \n* Saw soldiers with swastikas, black sun, and kolovrat tattoos or patches. Significance of these symbols is different. Seen as a symbol against communism, anti Soviet, strength, or heritage. Even a Jewish officer wore a kolovrat patch. Experienced antisemitism but only from people not wearing any of these. Nationalist, racist, and national socialist ideas are more acceptable than in Germany.\n* Phone use on the front is common: for communication, maps, and calling in artillery. The Ukrainian army has custom mapping and artillery apps. Russians and Ukrainians use the cell phone network.",

But they\u2019re lucky the Russians are often incompetent. </li>\n<li>examples of Russian incompetence: no RPGs used against Humvees, no sentries, everyone sleeps, surrender quickly </li>\n<li>Spetznaz GRU is often made up of 90% old mobiks, but has great equipment. </li>\n<li>100 VDV with 2 BMD-4 beaten by 40 guys in humvees. </li>\n<li> Was injured by a grenade dropped from a quadcopter drone. He had noticed the drone beforehand. Still has fragments all over inside his body. Medical care was immediate and he had to be operated on. He made a full recovery. </li>\n<li>Hasn\u2019t experienced friendly fire. </li>\n<li>Russian war crimes: Russian Bombardment of civilian areas like in Irpin. Dead civilians in Bucha. </li>\n<li>Ukrainian war crimes: Ukrainians didn\u2019t treat prisoners well. Demeaning and humiliating treatment like making them say Putin Huilo. Also physical assault. Videos of that are shared among troops and officers. Spontaneous executions. But Ukrainians investigated the executions. Results of investigations are unknown.</li>\n<li>Women in the legion slept around and that lead to a lot of drama. </li>\n<li>Loved the Ukrainian soldiers and their loyalty and solidarity. </li>\n<li>Ukrainians loved foreign volunteers.

Information and data given to superiors ended up on the internet. </li>\n<li>NLAW and javelins are rare. Other RPGs, anti tank launchers, and infantry ammunition was plentiful. </li>\n<li>Saw soldiers with swastikas, black sun, and kolovrat tattoos or patches. Significance of these symbols is different. Seen as a symbol against communism, anti Soviet, strength, or heritage. Even a Jewish officer wore a kolovrat patch. Experienced antisemitism but only from people not wearing any of these. Nationalist, racist, and national socialist ideas are more acceptable than in Germany.</li>\n<li>Phone use on the front is common: for communication, maps, and calling in artillery.

                "body": "Generally the Ukrainians have around 4000 personnel per brigade. Maybe it's worth mentioning that these new brigades might be somewhat smaller than many pre-existing brigades because they have been reorganized into three army corps to establish an intermediate level of command between the general staff and brigades. The corps commands seem to be set up to handle some of the logistics and staff planning responsibilities that have crept into the responsibilities owned by brigades on the front lines due to the lack of divisional commands. So these new brigades may be more tactically focused, with fewer logistics and support elements, and thus not quite as large. That said, those responsibilities still exist and would be transferred to the corps-level units, so the total number of personnel required should be roughly the same in total. So there's probably around 36,000 troops in the new corps.\n\nThere are also new brigades that have been trained exclusively in Ukraine, about which we have substantially less information (either because of Ukrainian opsec or because the media focused a lot on the western equipment and training of the nine new armored brigades, or both). My rough estimate is something between an additional nine and 16 brigades have been in formation or upsizing around smaller formations like volunteer regiments. Although some may have been rotated to the line already. e.g., the 3rd Assault Brigade, which was formed around the Azov Regiment and is now fighting in Bakhmut, where it has been on the line since late December. Typically those brigades have some of the less choice western equipment or are equipped with purely legacy Ukrainian post-Soviet kit, but may have better training and officers than is typical for some of the units that have been left holding the lines for months.\n\nI'm guessing the idea is to use the nine western-trained and -equipped brigades as three penetration divisions of three brigades each. With each trio of brigades forming an army corps in Ukraine's echelonment but functioning as what would probably be called a heavy reinforced division under a more typical western echelonment. Any of the purely Ukrainian-equipped brigades devoted to the offensive will act as security forces to solidify and hold any gains from breakthroughs accomplished by the penetration divisions. So that's another 36,000 - 64,000 troops that might participate in the offensive, for a total of 72,000 - 100,000 (although with at least the 3rd AB already committed to combat, I doubt it will be the full 100k). \n\nIn practice that would look something like a brigade such as the western-trained 47th OMB riding its brand new Bradleys straight into the teeth of Russian fortifications during a breaching assault to penetrate the first line of defense. Once they establish a secure gap, the two other brigades from their corps follow through and take the lead to continue pushing the Russians past the first line of defense toward their secondary lines (or whatever the target of the offensive might be). Those brigades would then in turn be followed by some number of the security brigades, which would clear out any remaining pockets of resistance, siege any bypassed settlements or fortifications, establish defensive positions to protect the salient's flanks, and secure/establish supply lines to support the tip of the spear brigades as they continue deeper into enemy-held territory. At that point, the first penetration brigade would pass responsibility for holding the gap off to one of those brigades and either rejoin the rest of corps on the offensive, or take some time to rest and refit if losses from the assault were sufficiently bad to require that. \n\nAll of which means the Ukrainians are likely capable of attacking against fortified Russian positions along three independent axes, each of which has a unified army corps command capable of independently managing logistics and planning for their axis of attack. And each of which also have the necessary troops and equipment for breaching assaults and for securing territory retaken during an advance. Assuming one security brigade per penetration brigade, that means the Ukrainians can attack with 24,000 soldiers in three separate locations, or up to 72,000 in a single location if they attack along mutually supporting axes of advance. \n\nThere are many places on the line where the Russians are not able to muster 12,000 soldiers to defend multiple kilometers of the line. So even with just the 36,000 or so soldiers in the penetration brigades, the Ukrainians should be able to gain local numerical superiority sufficient to support a breakthrough (assuming the 3:1 standard ratio, which is sort of a silly ratio when talking about opponents with major differences in capabilities, but is a decent baseline at least). e.g., there are likely fewer than 12,000 Russian troops in western Zaporizhzhia right now). The only questions are whether the Ukrainians will be able to find and attack a place where they have sufficient overmatch, and whether they will be able to carry off the complicated tactical maneuvers required to conduct an armored assault breach against Russian fortifications. They could have 120,000 soldiers against 12,000 and still not be able to achieve a breakthrough if they lack the skills to get their different combined arms components working together well. So that's the biggest question. Because their only alternative to a breaching assault is a slow, long range attritional battle like the battle for Kherson last year.",

[They did not admit liability](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/01/11/ship-owners-to-pay-us-government-for-fitzgerald-collision/) and the amount paid out was tiny relative to the damages. The company decided it was cheaper to pay the Navy off than to fight the entire US government in court. Or, more likely, their insurance company made that decision, knowing that the Navy would fight to the death to avoid admitting liability and has the resources to do so essentially forever.\n\nThe Navy investigation's claims that the *ACX Crystal's* crew were negligent were based on very tiny errors which would not rise to the level of negligence on the timeline the crew had to react to the collision risk. For example, the report claims that they failed to maintain sufficient visual lookout to detect the potential for collision. [Even though the *Fitz* changed bearings **a mere eight minutes** before the collision](https://news.usni.org/2020/09/03/ntsb-unexplained-course-change-was-a-critical-error-in-fatal-uss-fitzgerald-collision), which does not leave much time for visual detection and collision avoidance. I mean, think about it, you're in a big ass ship that's impossible to miss, and all the other big ass ships that are impossible to miss are visible on your radar so you can avoid them pretty much automatically. So you can have someone stare out at empty ocean for 24 hours a day, but they aren't going to spot every potential collision instantly.\n\nAnd not reacting to the *Fitz* was the appropriate decision before that final course change. Because the *Crystal* was the stand-on vessel and so was required to maintain course to allow the give-way vessel, the *Fitz* in this case, to maneuver to avoid. If they both maneuver, there is the chance that their maneuvers will cancel out, which is why the stand-on vessel is required to keep going straight until the risk of collision is gone or it becomes clear that the give-way vessel is not avoiding for some reason. Until eight minutes before the collision, it seemed as if the *Fitz* was avoiding the collision and so there was no need to assume a collision risk. After the *Crystal's* crew detected that last course change, it might have taken them an additional two or three minutes to realize that the *Fitz* had actually changed to a collision course, leaving them a mere five or six minutes to react to an incredibly unusual event. Something so unusual that 99.9999% of merchant mariners will never encounter it, i.e. a USN destroyer so incompetently skippered that it rammed a container ship.\n\nLike I can't emphasize this enough, but it's really hard for someone to visually determine that a ship is on an approaching collision course at night, because you need to know how the lights are rigged on the ship to determine whether it is on an approaching angle, and warships have unique rigging which can make it confusing to determine their angle. At least compared to how easy it is to make that determination for a ship with more familiar rigging like a sailboat or container ship. Maybe not enough that a pro shouldn't be able to do it, but enough to slow their judgment by a few seconds or minutes. \n\nThat eight minutes is an especially short window because the *Fitz* was going a blistering 20 knots and closed distance very quickly. The report also criticizes the *Crystal* for not using their horn to issue the five blast pre-collision warning, but by the time they were within range for the horn to be particularly noticeable, the collision was already inevitable because the *Fitz* was going so fast. And the container ship's watch officers were preoccupied with attempting a last ditch maneuver to avoid, so likely didn't have the bandwidth to try anything so unlikely to help. Prior to that point, they properly used their signaling lamp to try to get the attention of the destroyer. They probably should have gotten on the radio and attempted to hail the *Fitz*, and the watch officer probably should have informed the ship's master as soon as a collision risk was detected, but *in five to eight minutes*? It is likely they assumed that the warship would see them, because it is so unthinkable that a warship would maintain such a poor watch or would be running at such speed at night crossing a busy sea lane perpendicular to traffic with non-functional radar. Plus, this is a container ship, not a warship. An eight minute collision avoidance reaction time would be really remarkably fast for a ship like that at sea. Working on those ships is more like working in an office than like working on a warship. It's predictable and routine, and reaction times don't have to be as hair trigger as required for a naval vessel. They don't do damage control drills and action stations and alert levels and all that crap to train for fast reaction times (they do damage control drills but that's just like regular routine training like doing a fire drill, not something they practice in earnest on the regular). So you can't expect them to react with the same speed a naval ship would.\n\n[But most importantly, the USN findings were contravened by an **independent** Japanese government Transport Safety Board investigation which makes many of the same points I do here and more, and also unlike the Navy is not an interested and biased party](https://www.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/eng-mar_report/2019/2017tk0009e.pdf).",

At a minimum for SSBI, but even for lower tier clearances. There are ways social media can come up during a review, but it's not by default currently. And there needs to be some black box mechanism on the government side for verifying that the self-reported social media accounts are a complete representation of the applicant's social media presence. That mechanism may or may not already exist, I'm not in a position to know, but even if so it isn't very useful in the absence of more widespread social media reviews.\n\nSimply put, your average 19 year old is not going to have anywhere enough financial or employment history to be sufficient for evaluating their trustworthiness. Nor does any of the collateral collected even for older candidates during a standard security clearance review really relate to much other than the candidate's susceptibility to foreign influence exerted via close personal connections or finances, or (semi-relatedly) their susceptibility to bribery because of financial problems. So only one or two narrow categories of motivation for insider threat are covered.\n\nAnd I'd argue that's even inadequate for its stated purpose... they ask about personal ownership stakes in foreign companies, but do not ask if your parent's have any such stakes, even though inheritance would be one of the easiest ways to pass a bribe undetected. e.g., someone could own a Chinese company that receives large subsidies from the Chinese government, and their children would never need to mention that in response to the direct questions on the SF86 (arguably it is something an applicant should volunteer in response to one of the open ended questions, but it's a rather glaring omission considering that the form asks for information about close relatives in other questions). Although with financial issues like that, at least they can review your bank records and flag any questionable transactions. Or if you have problems with financial responsibility, they can see that via your credit score and history of transactions. So there is some independent collateral that can be used to cross-check the SF86 questions about those issues.\n\nBut social media reviews are far more likely to find material implicating a broader array of potential areas of concern than just financial irresponsibility or susceptibility to foreign influence. For example, the SF86 includes the classic government employment questions about whether the applicant has ever participated in or supported any effort to violently overthrow the US government or participated in or supported any group which has the purpose of violently overthrowing the government. Of course everyone just says, \"no.\" Even if they are committed members of extreme right wing militias that very much do want to overthrow the government violently. Unlike questions about financial responsibility, there's no easily collected collateral to confirm an applicant's response to the insurrectionist question, in the absence of social media review. Unless there is some government record tying that individual to the militia (e.g., an arrest at a protest), there won't be any cause for the reviewer to follow up on the question to check social media, even if the applicant's Discord posts are loaded with violent right wing rhetoric.

The human prefrontal cortex just doesn't develop enough by that age to hold people fully accountable for their actions. I don't see why we should treat school disciplinary records as somehow more reliable than an actual court conviction.\n\nDenying someone a security clearance has a very serious negative effect on their career, so it's not a decision made lightly. In practice what you're suggesting is not that every kid that makes violent race-based threats should be denied a security clearance, you're saying every kid whom *a school determines to punish for making race based threats* should be denied a clearance. Do you trust every school to properly adjudicate accusations about threats of racial violence? IME schools can be pretty messed up, unfair places where adverse disciplinary decisions are routinely made on the thinnest of pretexts.\n\nJust from my own life, when I was in high school 20+ years ago, I was punished with a month of detentions for fighting. Except the other kid had attacked me when I was alone and he was with his friends. I defended myself for a bit before a teacher arrived and broke the fight up. The other kid's friends said I started it, and so, despite knowing the witnesses were the other kid's friends and not mine, and that they frequently lied to cover for each other, the school punished me equally alongside the instigator. Although there was no racial element, I am quite certain that this group of bullies would happily have lied to claim I had made a racial threat against the other kid, if we didn't both happen to be white. They'd have taken any chance to screw me over. And the school would have taken them at their word, because that was the policy. They didn't want to get into the business of evaluating the credibility of individual kids. But ultimately, that means school disciplinary records are often thin grounds for making momentous decisions about someone's life. (also, FWIW, this particular incident occurred at a school not too far away from Dighton-Rehobeth where Texeira went to school, and I can pretty confidently say DR's administrators aren't exactly known for their procedural fairness, although I don't know the details of his case).\n\nAlso context matters a lot. A 13 year old kid screaming, \"I'm gonna kill you [insert slur here]\" in an Xbox game is different than an 18 year old threatening a minority student with a knife in person, for example. I'd say the former could very easily be dismissed as youthful indiscretion, whereas the latter is extremely concerning. Yet technically both could occur at a high school and could result in suspension.",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There&#39;s a reason we don&#39;t give minors permanent criminal records, even when they&#39;ve been convicted of committing a serious crime. The human prefrontal cortex just doesn&#39;t develop enough by that age to hold people fully accountable for their actions. I don&#39;t see why we should treat school disciplinary records as somehow more reliable than an actual court conviction.</p>\n\n<p>Denying someone a security clearance has a very serious negative effect on their career, so it&#39;s not a decision made lightly. In practice what you&#39;re suggesting is not that every kid that makes violent race-based threats should be denied a security clearance, you&#39;re saying every kid whom <em>a school determines to punish for making race based threats</em> should be denied a clearance. Do you trust every school to properly adjudicate accusations about threats of racial violence? IME schools can be pretty messed up, unfair places where adverse disciplinary decisions are routinely made on the thinnest of pretexts.</p>\n\n<p>Just from my own life, when I was in high school 20+ years ago, I was punished with a month of detentions for fighting. Except the other kid had attacked me when I was alone and he was with his friends. I defended myself for a bit before a teacher arrived and broke the fight up. The other kid&#39;s friends said I started it, and so, despite knowing the witnesses were the other kid&#39;s friends and not mine, and that they frequently lied to cover for each other, the school punished me equally alongside the instigator. Although there was no racial element, I am quite certain that this group of bullies would happily have lied to claim I had made a racial threat against the other kid, if we didn&#39;t both happen to be white. They&#39;d have taken any chance to screw me over. And the school would have taken them at their word, because that was the policy. They didn&#39;t want to get into the business of evaluating the credibility of individual kids. But ultimately, that means school disciplinary records are often thin grounds for making momentous decisions about someone&#39;s life. (also, FWIW, this particular incident occurred at a school not too far away from Dighton-Rehobeth where Texeira went to school, and I can pretty confidently say DR&#39;s administrators aren&#39;t exactly known for their procedural fairness, although I don&#39;t know the details of his case).</p>\n\n<p>Also context matters a lot. A 13 year old kid screaming, &quot;I&#39;m gonna kill you [insert slur here]&quot; in an Xbox game is different than an 18 year old threatening a minority student with a knife in person, for example. I&#39;d say the former could very easily be dismissed as youthful indiscretion, whereas the latter is extremely concerning. Yet technically both could occur at a high school and could result in suspension.</p>\n</div>",

The company is also providing radars to army and air force projects.</p>\n\n<p>Under the agreement, the federal government will buy out American defence giant Northrop Grumman\u2019s 49 per cent stake by July. Eighteen months later, CEA Technologies will become majority-owned by the Commonwealth and converted to a Government Business Enterprise (GBE) as other minority shareholders are bought out.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of that 18 months, the company\u2019s co-founder, Ian Croser, will remain the lone minority shareholder. The Commonwealth has first rights to buy those shares if Mr Croser wants to divest them, or dies, meaning that over time the company will become 100 per cent owned by taxpayers.</p>\n\n<p>While the deal puts CEA into public hands, the government insists ownership will not influence procurement decisions by the Defence Department. CEA will continue to pursue commercial opportunities, including exports, including potential sales to the United States.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Either way, the Ukrainian force structure is only plausibly compatible with the figure 250 if it means vehicles instead of systems.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that BUKs can be readily replaced by NASAMS/IRIS-T.

But relations between Europe and China have been fraying, particularly after President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a \u201cno limits\u201d friendship weeks before Moscow invaded Ukraine. \n\n>A spokesperson from the German economy ministry declined to comment. \n\n>BASF shares fell back to session lows following the news to trade down 4.3% at 12:37 p.m. in Frankfurt. Merck KGaA was little changed. Spokespeople from the two companies declined to comment. \n\n>Scholz and Economy Minister Robert Habeck are liaising closely on the matter with European allies and the US, which is pushing for a global blockade of China\u2019s access to key technologies, including semiconductors. Officials in Berlin said there\u2019s no pressure from Washington on the matter but rather a strong desire to work together and to close ranks on China. \n\n>Semiconductors are a key part of the global supply chain, found in everything from cars and smartphones to refrigerators, and the materials and machines needed for their production are often difficult to obtain. Choking off an already limited supply line could thwart China\u2019s ability to advance its own industry.\n\n>Talks within the ruling coalition on such export controls are still at an early stage and officials are aware that any such decision could damage business ties with China, which has become Germany\u2019s largest trading partner, the people said.\n\n>Dual-Use Goods\n>Habeck, who is also the vice chancellor, has advised officials in his department to work on a tool box of measures to strengthen Germany\u2019s economic resilience in certain areas and reduce one-sided dependencies on China. The idea of imposing export controls on chip chemicals is part of these deliberations, the people said.\n\n>The quickest and most practical way to implement such export controls would be to put the respective goods and services on Germany\u2019s national dual-use list, one of the people said, adding that other approaches via international lists and treaties would probably take too long.\n\n>Export controls restrict trade in goods which can be used in both a civilian and military context. The aim of such dual-use lists is to prevent the development and proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as the hidden production of conventional military weapons.\n\n>Earlier this month, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock traded barbs with her Chinese counterpart Qin Gang during a visit to Beijing, saying Taiwan\u2019s destabilization would be a \u201chorror scenario.\u201d Baerbock and Habeck are helping Scholz shape a new security strategy that is meant to reduce reliance on China and shield critical infrastructure from hybrid attacks. \n\n>The Netherlands last month agreed to join the US effort to limit exports of chip technology to China. The new measures will rein in exports of ASML\u2019s immersion DUV lithography products, adding to restrictions that already exist for the most cutting-edge lithography machines, which are critical to producing the world\u2019s most advanced chips. The rules are expected to be published before the summer.\n\n>While Germany does not have advanced chip-making technologies, Merck and BASF provide firms around the world with critical chemicals required for making semiconductors. Merck\u2019s products or services are found in almost every single chip in the world, while BASF is a market leader in Europe and Asia, home to the world\u2019s most important contract chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. \n\n>Without supplies from Merck and BASF, China could face more challenges in developing advanced chip technologies and even its capabilities to make semiconductors could be affected. Xi has evoked a Soviet-style \u201cwhole nation\u201d system to encourage state-owned enterprises, research institutes and private companies to create technologies that can replace foreign imports amid US efforts to curb China\u2019s technological rise, but the country\u2019s chip industry is still lagging years behind TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co.\n\n>Even as Scholz considers these restrictions, he is also seeking to maintain open relations with Beijing. The chancellor has invited Chinese Premier Li Qiang for talks in Berlin on June 20 in his latest bid to ease tensions between Europe and the government in Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.\n\n>In the talks, Scholz wants to gauge China\u2019s readiness to be a constructive partner on challenges including promoting global peace and tackling climate change while setting out red lines to any changes to the status quo in Taiwan, according to people familiar with the plans. \n\n>Germany is determined to reduce its footprint in China with Berlin still struggling with the consequences of its over-reliance on Russian energy following Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine.

You say they can't be reliably effective, and that'd be true if they consistently stayed well in the backlines, but most of the Lancet footage that has been geolocated hasn't been anywhere close to 30kms behind the zero line. Artillery duels are happening, and that's giving loitering drones their space to function. But take that away, and then what? Further, my main point is that 100 or even 200 hits aren't tactically significant, let alone operationally so. You're being influenced by the clumping of footage.
