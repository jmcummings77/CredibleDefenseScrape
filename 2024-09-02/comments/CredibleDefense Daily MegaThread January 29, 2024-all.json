        "body": "U.S. SOCOM is looking to increase capabilities in two areas. First, a new sniper rifle. Second, improving radar on their C-130s.\n\n[US special operations forces are searching for a new extreme long-range rifle for their next big fight | Business Insider | January 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/socom-searching-new-rifle-snipers-deal-damage-in-modern-combat-2024-1)\n\n*In December, US Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, released a solicitation for offers for a new sniper rifle. The notice requires certain standard characteristics for the new sniper rifle.*\n\n*The Extreme Long Range-Sniper Rifle (ELR-SR) program is looking for a new modular, magazine-fed, multi-caliber capable system to replace the M107 Barret and MK15 anti-personnel and anti-materiel sniper rifles. There is a requirement that the weapon's operator be able to swap barrels easily within 5 minutes.*\n\n*SOCOM also wants its new sniper rifle to be significantly lighter than the ones it will be replacing. With a maximum weight of 22 lbs, the ELR-SR will be almost 9 lbs lighter than the M107 Barret and about 5 lbs lighter than the MK15. In terms of range, the ELR-SR is expected to be similar to older sniper rifles.*\n\n*Special Operations Command is looking for a precision weapon that can hit targets up to 2,500 meters (1.5 miles) away. As for its durability, SOCOM wants the new sniper rifle to have a barrel life of between 1,200 and 1,500 rounds.*\n\n*Additionally, the new rifle should be capable of firing the .300 Norma Mangum bullet, which has been approved by the Department of Defense, as well as subsonic and supersonic rounds.*\n\n*SOCOM also specified that the new sniper rifle should be able to take a sound suppressor no more than 8.5 inches long with recoil-reducing attributes. The command is also looking for a rifle with as little recoil as possible because the less recoil a weapon has, the more accurate the shooter can be.*\n\n[AESA Radars For AC-130J, MC-130J Sought By SOCOM | The Warzone | January 2024](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/aesa-radars-for-ac-130j-mc-130j-sought-by-socom)\n\n*U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is testing the market to see if anyone can provide \u201crapid fielding\u201d of AESA (active electronically scanned array) radars to replace the existing radars on AC-130J Ghostrider gunships and MC-130J Commando II special operations transport/tanker aircraft. Such a move would replace the AN/APN-241 mechanically scanned weather and navigation radars on these aircraft with an AESA radar set, bringing vastly different capabilities to the platform.*\n\n*SOCOM placed a request for information (RFI) on the federal SAM.com contracting website Thursday. That was the first apparent formal step taken by the command to pursue a capability it has sought, at least to some degree, since at least 2015. That's when SOCOM revealed that it had been testing the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon's Eye radar pod on its gunships. SOCOM later decided that would not work.*\n\n*Then-Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) commander Lt. Gen. James Slife brought up the concept again at a September 2022 Air and Space Forces Association conference. Slife is now a general, serving as Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.*\n\n*\u201cI think we\u2019re in the terminal stages of concluding an agreement with an industry partner that will allow us to put an\u2026 AESA radar on a C-130, which provides a whole host of capabilities that we haven\u2019t seen up to this point,\u201d Slife told reporters during a media roundtable at the time.*\n\n*An AESA radar \"on a C-130 opens up a host of possibilities for everything from airborne electronic attack and airborne cyber effects and things of that nature that up to now have not been part of our portfolio,\u201d he added.*\n\n*In May 2023, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) Program Executive Office for Fixed Wing aircraft (PEO-FW) announced plans to test a Ghostrider gunship equipped with AESA radar.*\n\n*It is unclear what happened to the agreement Slife mentioned two years ago or the Ghostrider test, but AFSOC is apparently just now beginning to formally engage industry on a wide scale about its intentions of adding the sensor system that would greatly boost the capabilities of both aircraft.*\n\n*AESA radar systems offer major benefits over their mechanically scanned array counterparts. These include near instant scanning speed, being able to execute multiple modes at once, the range at which they can spot targets and their overall fidelity. They are also more resistant to jamming and are far more reliable, mainly because they lack their predecessors moving parts.*\n\n*But for the AC-130, specifically, an AESA radar could allow it to do things it current cannot, which includes engaging targets in all weather and over great ranges without external support and tracking moving targets on the ground over broad areas. These two capabilities are enabled by synthetic aperture radar imaging and ground moving target indicator modes. You can read about what an AESA could bring to the AC-130J in far greater detail in our previous feature linked here.*\n\n*One thing that is worth noting is that placing an AESA radar in an AC-130J's nose, unless it was installed on a swashplate, would not allow it to scan directly to its left side, where the AC-130's guns are installed. The radar could still help pick out fixed targets to hit with the guns, but directing the guns against moving targets via radar would not likely be possible without another side-mounted array.

Second, improving radar on their C-130s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/socom-searching-new-rifle-snipers-deal-damage-in-modern-combat-2024-1\">US special operations forces are searching for a new extreme long-range rifle for their next big fight | Business Insider | January 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>In December, US Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, released a solicitation for offers for a new sniper rifle. The notice requires certain standard characteristics for the new sniper rifle.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Extreme Long Range-Sniper Rifle (ELR-SR) program is looking for a new modular, magazine-fed, multi-caliber capable system to replace the M107 Barret and MK15 anti-personnel and anti-materiel sniper rifles. There is a requirement that the weapon&#39;s operator be able to swap barrels easily within 5 minutes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>SOCOM also wants its new sniper rifle to be significantly lighter than the ones it will be replacing. With a maximum weight of 22 lbs, the ELR-SR will be almost 9 lbs lighter than the M107 Barret and about 5 lbs lighter than the MK15. In terms of range, the ELR-SR is expected to be similar to older sniper rifles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Special Operations Command is looking for a precision weapon that can hit targets up to 2,500 meters (1.5 miles) away. As for its durability, SOCOM wants the new sniper rifle to have a barrel life of between 1,200 and 1,500 rounds.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Additionally, the new rifle should be capable of firing the .300 Norma Mangum bullet, which has been approved by the Department of Defense, as well as subsonic and supersonic rounds.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>SOCOM also specified that the new sniper rifle should be able to take a sound suppressor no more than 8.5 inches long with recoil-reducing attributes. The command is also looking for a rifle with as little recoil as possible because the less recoil a weapon has, the more accurate the shooter can be.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/aesa-radars-for-ac-130j-mc-130j-sought-by-socom\">AESA Radars For AC-130J, MC-130J Sought By SOCOM | The Warzone | January 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is testing the market to see if anyone can provide \u201crapid fielding\u201d of AESA (active electronically scanned array) radars to replace the existing radars on AC-130J Ghostrider gunships and MC-130J Commando II special operations transport/tanker aircraft. Such a move would replace the AN/APN-241 mechanically scanned weather and navigation radars on these aircraft with an AESA radar set, bringing vastly different capabilities to the platform.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>SOCOM placed a request for information (RFI) on the federal SAM.com contracting website Thursday. That was the first apparent formal step taken by the command to pursue a capability it has sought, at least to some degree, since at least 2015. That&#39;s when SOCOM revealed that it had been testing the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon&#39;s Eye radar pod on its gunships. SOCOM later decided that would not work.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Then-Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) commander Lt. Gen. James Slife brought up the concept again at a September 2022 Air and Space Forces Association conference. Slife is now a general, serving as Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cI think we\u2019re in the terminal stages of concluding an agreement with an industry partner that will allow us to put an\u2026 AESA radar on a C-130, which provides a whole host of capabilities that we haven\u2019t seen up to this point,\u201d Slife told reporters during a media roundtable at the time.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>An AESA radar &quot;on a C-130 opens up a host of possibilities for everything from airborne electronic attack and airborne cyber effects and things of that nature that up to now have not been part of our portfolio,\u201d he added.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In May 2023, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) Program Executive Office for Fixed Wing aircraft (PEO-FW) announced plans to test a Ghostrider gunship equipped with AESA radar.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It is unclear what happened to the agreement Slife mentioned two years ago or the Ghostrider test, but AFSOC is apparently just now beginning to formally engage industry on a wide scale about its intentions of adding the sensor system that would greatly boost the capabilities of both aircraft.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>AESA radar systems offer major benefits over their mechanically scanned array counterparts. These include near instant scanning speed, being able to execute multiple modes at once, the range at which they can spot targets and their overall fidelity. They are also more resistant to jamming and are far more reliable, mainly because they lack their predecessors moving parts.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>But for the AC-130, specifically, an AESA radar could allow it to do things it current cannot, which includes engaging targets in all weather and over great ranges without external support and tracking moving targets on the ground over broad areas. These two capabilities are enabled by synthetic aperture radar imaging and ground moving target indicator modes. You can read about what an AESA could bring to the AC-130J in far greater detail in our previous feature linked here.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>One thing that is worth noting is that placing an AESA radar in an AC-130J&#39;s nose, unless it was installed on a swashplate, would not allow it to scan directly to its left side, where the AC-130&#39;s guns are installed. The radar could still help pick out fixed targets to hit with the guns, but directing the guns against moving targets via radar would not likely be possible without another side-mounted array. There are smaller modular solutions that exist for such an installation that could be tied into the larger forward-facing array.</em></p>\n</div>",

Others, led by Kissinger, argued that cutting off supplies would just give up what leverage the US had over Israel and remove any incentive for the Israeli government to refrain from doing things the US <em>really</em> didn&#39;t want them to do, like driving on Cairo and possibly provoking direct Soviet military involvement. </p>\n\n<p>Kissinger&#39;s view prevailed, and ultimately turned out to be correct - a few days later Israel did accept the cease-fire, and the continuing strong relationship between the US and Israeli governments set the stage for the Carter administration to broker the Camp David Accords, a foreign policy coup that continues to be one of the cornerstones of US policy in the region.</p>\n</div>",

Agency Staff\u2019s Links to Oct. 7 Attack](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/at-least-12-u-n-agency-employees-involved-in-oct-7-attacks-intelligence-reports-say-a7de8f36)\n\nAround 10% of Palestinian aid agency\u2019s 12,000 staff in Gaza have links to militants, according to intelligence dossier\n\nSix United Nations Relief and Works Agency workers were part of the wave of Palestinian militants who killed 1,200 people in the deadliest assault on Jews since the Holocaust, according to the intelligence dossier. Two helped kidnap Israelis. Two others were tracked to sites where scores of Israeli civilians were shot and killed. Others coordinated logistics for the assault, including procuring weapons.\n\n\nOf the 12 Unrwa employees with links to the attacks, seven were primary or secondary school teachers, including two math teachers, two Arabic language teachers and one primary school teacher.\n\n\u2026\n\nTwo officials familiar with the intelligence said the Unrwa employees considered to have ties with militant groups were deemed to be \u201coperatives,\u201d indicating they took active part in the organization\u2019s military or political framework. The report said 23% of Unrwa\u2019s male employees had ties to Hamas, a higher percentage than the average of 15% for adult males in Gaza, indicating a higher politicization of the agency than the population at large.\nNearly half of all Unrwa employees\u2014an estimated 49%\u2014also had close relatives who also had official ties to the militant groups, especially Hamas, the intelligence reports said.\n\n\u2026\n\nTeachers make up nearly three-quarters of Unrwa\u2019s Gaza-based local staff. Unrwa schools, which use textbooks approved by the Palestinian Authority, have come under fire for using materials that allegedly glorify terrorists and promote hatred of Israel. Unrwa says it has taken steps to address problematic content, but a 2019 U.S. Government Accountability Office report said that measures haven\u2019t always been implemented.\n\n\nSince Oct. 7, Hamas has stolen more than $1 million worth of Unrwa supplies, including fuel and trucks, according to the intelligence report. The intelligence assessment alleges that Hamas operatives are so deeply enmeshed within the Unrwa aid-delivery enterprise as to coordinate transfers for the organization.",

The fact that Kharkov was succesful was precisely because there was neither prepared defenses nor troops to man them.\n\nThere's simply too much firepower available at the line of contact. Your massed tank columns are going to get chewed up in no time and if you push your supporting equipment forward, towards the LoC, to cover said breakthrough units they'll simply get destroyed as they get in range as well. The reason both sides have defaulted to 'Wagner-style' small-infantry tactics is because that's the slow-grinding way of advancing in this war. Kudos to Zaluzhny for calling off the original plan after less than a week rather than doubling down and correspondingly, at the very least, doubling the losses. Neither side can afford to provide juicy targets at the LoC unless they've managed to suppress the enemy backline sufficiently - and I've no idea how any observer of the conflict can or could believe that the Ukrainians would be able to out-quantity (and quality, for that matter) the Russians in this regard. \n\nDiverting your resources also means diverting your enemies' resources. It also means not giving the opponent the opportunity to smash you decisively in one battle so that you can live to fight another day.\n\nI'm sure the Ukrainian soldiers are more than happy that they're commanded by Zaluzhny and not some idiot braindeadly following a NATO manual, irrespective of battlefield realities.

Su-24s and Su-34s seem to be doing the majority of strikes, but Russia could greatly increase their sortie rate if they started also using, say, Su-27s. Now, one probably wouldn\u2019t see Tu-22M3s dropping these bombs (on account of the value per sortie and their value as missile trucks), but despite multiple Patriot ambushes, these sorties are mostly safe from air defenses. It would seem logical to me that the Russians would like to intensify such strikes as much as possible, even if UMPK accuracy is often questionable. What\u2019s the current trajectory here, and how are we expecting this to evolve with the addition of F-16s (and potentially Gripens eventually) this year?",

If they intend to be cautious with them and use them primarily for local air defense, shooting down missiles, Shaheeds, and only occasionally bringing them closer to the front to take a pot shot at these bombers or launch a HARM or storm shadow.

However if they are aggressive with them and attempt to inflict serious attrition on Russian bombers they likely will be capable of that. \n\nOf course all of this is heavily dependent on the likely rate of further supply of aircraft and the type of missiles they receive. If Ukraine is confident they can loose a couple dozen F16s over the next two years and get replacements they are likely to be aggressive, if they only get 45 or so they will certainly keep them in reserve and only use them near the front when they have absolute confidence of achieving a successful mission. There is also the significant unknown of what long range missiles they will receive. If the US only permits the use of older variants of the AMRAM then they will be much more vulnerable to Russian aircraft when attempting to intercept bombers.
