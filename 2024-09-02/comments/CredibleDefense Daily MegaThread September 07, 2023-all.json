Outside powers, due to the expansion of their navies, are moving to assume a larger role (see\u00a0EDM, June 24, 2021). However, if that had been possible until this summer due to the fact that most of the littoral states had focused on the development of coast guards rather than genuine navies, that is no longer the case. Indeed, Astana has signed agreements with Ankara on Turkey\u2019s construction of naval vessels in Kazakhstan that not only will make the Central Asian state\u2019s fleet a powerful challenge to Russia\u2019s Caspian Flotilla but will also allow Turkey to project power throughout the region by giving the Turkish government the capacity to be the naval contractor of first resort or even use the ships it builds under the flags of others to promote Turkish goals (EurAsia Daily, July 29; see\u00a0EDM, August 1).\n\nMoscow officials are increasingly taking notice of these developments with some warning that other littoral states may follow Kazakhstan in naval matters (T. me/aviapro1, August 1;\u00a0Kz.tsargrad, August 23;\u00a0Sovsekretno, August 29). A few even go so far as to suggest that this move will allow Turkey to project power far beyond the Turkish world and allow it to become the dominant geopolitical power along the entire southern portion of the post-Soviet space all the way to the borders of China (Rossaprimavera, July 31). While such conclusions are at a minimum premature, they are a clear sign that what Turkey has been doing and, more importantly, plans to do as far as naval construction on the Caspian represents a key new battleground for geopolitical and even military competition. Moscow will likely be compelled to respond lest it lose its historical dominance not only in the Caspian itself but with the other littoral states as well.\n\nAs recently as five years ago, Moscow thought it had cornered the market on shipbuilding by others on the Caspian littoral. This was accomplished both through bilateral agreements, which meant that most of these countries, including Kazakhstan, looked to the Russian Federation for shipbuilding, and through the provisions of the 2018 accord of these states on the delimitation of the Caspian, ending conflicts among the littoral countries on these matters which had arisen after 1991 (see EDM,\u00a0June 7, 2018;\u00a0August 16, 2022). Neither approach has delivered. Moscow did sign numerous agreements with Kazakhstan and others to build ships. However, it has been unable to see the deals through, prompting these countries to look elsewhere, initially to shipbuilding powers such as South Korea and now increasingly to Turkey (see EDM, October\u00a05,\u00a012, 2021).\n\nAccording to at least one Russian analyst, Ankara has found a way around the restrictions about the introduction of foreign navies on the Caspian. Yury Lyamin, a senior researcher at Moscow\u2019s Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, according to\u00a0Sovershenno Sekretno, suggests that \u201cin order to control the oil and gas wealth of the Caspian Sea, and at the same time support their ally Azerbaijan, which is arguing for huge reserves of blue fuel with Turkmenistan, the Turks have come up with the idea of \u200b\u200bdeploying their naval forces here under the flags of their kindred \u201cTurkic\u201d countries, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. [Consequently,] although the 2018 Convention prohibits the deployment of armed forces of non-Caspian countries in the Caspian, Baku and Astana are ready to help circumvent the restrictions imposed by Russia and Iran\u201d (Sovsekretno, August 29). In short, what Ankara is doing now in Kazakhstan is not about that country alone but also about the projection of Turkish power to help its closest ally Azerbaijan, to ensure Turkish access to oil and gas from the Caspian basin and Central Asia and to make itself the dominant power over an enormous region.\n\nIf that were not enough for Moscow to take notice, Balmanov continues, Turkey wants to expand its influence within the current borders of the Russian Federation. The Turks, he says, \u201cconsider the representatives of peoples living in Russia, certain republics of the Caucasus, the Middle Volga, Kalmykia, parts of the Urals and Siberia\u201d as properly within their sphere of influence. Indeed, he says, Ankara\u2019s talk of \u201ca Turkish world\u201d is an effort to distract Russia and China from Turkey\u2019s longer-term aspirations that would threaten the position of both powers. Yet according to Balmanov, both Moscow and Beijing face a serious challenge now\u2014not so much geopolitical as geo-economic\u2014given that the presence of a Turkish-built fleet in the Caspian will ensure that trade routes bypassing Russia will continue to expand and that Moscow\u2019s ability to trade with Iran and the states on the Indian Ocean could be further reduced (see\u00a0EDM, April 25).\n\nThese dangers have only grown in the past two years, especially since the start of the Kremlin\u2019s so-called \u201cspecial military operation\u201d against Ukraine, the Moscow analyst says. Thus, \u201cthe question now is: will Russia, preoccupied with Ukraine and the sorting out of relations with the West be able to fend off the Turkish challenge in Kazakhstan and Central Asia? If it is not, then in the future, it is impossible to exclude the appearance of yet another state disloyal to Moscow on the long southeastern border of the Russian Federation.\u201d To counter Turkey, the Kremlin is likely to look in the first instance to China and then to Iran. Yet, Beijing may not prove as supportive of Moscow\u2019s interests as it will benefit from the expanded east-west trade that Turkish moves will ensure, even if Chinese interests could be threatened by an expansion of Turkish influence over the long term. That leaves Iran. It thus seems probable that the most likely consequence of the expansion of Turkish influence in the Caspian will be an effort by Moscow to draw in Tehran, Turkey\u2019s longstanding enemy (see EDM,\u00a0February 25, 2021;\u00a0November 1, 2022).\n\nAs a result, what may seem a minor sideshow in the Caspian Sea region could easily trigger a wider competition not just between Russia and the countries of the region but also with Tehran and the West\u2014a struggle that could presage yet another serious conflict with potentially as many far-reaching consequences as the fighting now taking place in Ukraine.",

The country was also the first nation to import South Korean KT-1 and T-50 aircraft and is the only country so far to have imported a South Korean submarine.\n\nThe two leaders agreed to continue to expand trade and investment based on their countries' Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which took effect in January, build up Indonesia's EV and battery industry, and facilitate increased exports of South Korean halal food to Indonesia.\n\nBilateral trade amounted to US$26 billion last year, the fourth-largest sum among ASEAN states, while South Korean investment in Indonesia reached an accumulated $22.7 billion last year, the third-largest sum among the bloc's members.\n\nThe two sides committed to enhancing cooperation in building infrastructure, such as carbon-neutral purification plants, water and sewage systems, and tunnels, in line with the planned relocation of Indonesia's capital city to the East Kalimantan province by 2045.\n\nAlso, Yoon and Widodo agreed to strengthen the institutional framework to support South Korean businesses in Indonesia, such as by protecting their key technologies, and to increase people-to-people exchanges through the launch of a new Korean language institute in Indonesia next year and additional government-sponsored scholarship programs, as well as university student exchange programs.\n\nThe leaders committed to boosting cooperation on regional and international issues as they agreed on the need for a firm and united response from the international community to North Korea's nuclear provocations and threats.",

If you&#39;re looking to aid Ukraine by contributing more Starlinks, consider <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dim0kq/status/1580827171903635456\">donating to this charity, which purchases Starlink units and covers their subscription fees for Ukraine</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much should Lockheed charge for HIMARS</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>$4.3705 million</strong>. Lockheed currently charges $4.3705 million to replace a single HIMARS vehicle that the U.S. sent to Ukraine. This rate is consistent with what the DoD pays for HIMARS, typically purchasing 40-50 vehicles at this price annually.</p>\n\n<p>Now, consider this: Wouldn&#39;t it be fair to say that without the HIMARS, Ukraine would be in trouble? Kinda like without Starlink Ukraine would be in trouble. Whether or not you agree with this assertion, entertain the idea for the purpose of our discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if Lockheed&#39;s CEO took a page out of Musk&#39;s playbook and threatened to disable HIMARS vehicles in Ukraine unless AFU, or the DoD, forked over an additional $400 million annually for Ukraine&#39;s HIMARS. What if it was revealed that the perceived accuracy issues with HIMARS, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/russia-jamming-himars-rockets-ukraine/index.html\">previously assumed to result from Russian GPS jamming</a>, were actually result of <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink-russia-crimea-war-drone-submarine-attack-sabotage/\">Lockheed CEO intentionally instructing Lockheed engineers to induce GMLRS rocket failures in Ukraine</a>? And suppose this was all under the guise of CEO wanting to prevent nuclear conflict (I&#39;m sure, that would be completely unrelated to the CEO&#39;s $400 million annual demand).</p>\n\n<p>In response to your question: Lockheed ought to charge $4.3705 million for a HIMARS vehicle for Ukraine, aligning with the standard HIMARS price tag. Notably, Lockheed didn&#39;t follow Musk&#39;s approach by demanding an additional $400 million, recognizing that both HIMARS and Starlink are crucial to Ukraine&#39;s survival. I wish Musk would emulate Lockheed, rather than exploiting Ukraine&#39;s predicament for profit.</p>\n\n<p>A fair approach, in my opinion, would be for <strong>Musk to announce that his 5,000 terminals will no longer operate for free</strong>. Instead, they would require the AFU to purchase a standard Starlink subscription and <strong>pay the standard, sticker price associated fees</strong>.</p>\n</div>",

Gen. Glenn Dean, Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems. \u201cThe war in Ukraine has highlighted a critical need for integrated protections for Soldiers, built from within instead of adding on.\u201d\n\n>The Abrams Main Battle Tank is a full-tracked, low-profile, land-combat assault weapon that enables Soldiers to dominate their adversaries through lethal firepower, unparalleled survivability and agile maneuvering. It closes with and destroys the enemy using mobility, firepower and shock effect.\n\n>Years of testing, analysis, Soldier feedback and maturing technology culminated in this strategic decision. The new approach balances costs with the Army\u2019s needs and invests in the nation\u2019s defense industrial base.\n\n>The development of the M1E3 Abrams will include the best features of the M1A2 SEPv4 and will comply with the latest modular open systems architecture standards, allowing quicker technology upgrades and requiring fewer resources. This will enable the Army and its commercial partners to design a more survivable, lighter tank that will be more effective on the battlefield at initial fielding, and more easy to upgrade in the future.\n\n>This modernization will enhance the efficacy and maneuverability of armored brigade combat teams in conflicts across the globe through a reduced sustainment footprint and increased operational and tactical mobility.\n\n>The Army will continue to produce the M1A2 SEPv3 at a reduced rate until production transitions to the M1E3 Abrams, and the Army will carry technologies forward into the SEPv4 Abrams modernization effort.\n\n>\u201cThe M1E3 Abrams nomenclature is a return to the Army\u2019s standard use of its type classification and nomenclature system for our combat vehicle fleet,\u201d said Dean. \u201cThe \u2018E\u2019 designation represents an engineering change to an existing platform that is more significant than a minor modification and serves to designate the prototype and development configuration until the vehicle is formally type classified and receives an \u2018A\u2019 designation. This is distinct from the \u2018XM\u2019 designation used for new prototype systems.\u201d\n\n>Initial operational capability is anticipated in early the 2030s.

That visit included representatives from Russia and was the first to head to North Korea since Kim closed his borders at the start of the pandemic. It indicated Kim was ready to ease up on curbs aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus that hurt trade with his two powerful neighbors.\n\n>It is unclear exactly why Liu, who also holds the title of vice premier, is traveling to North Korea, though he works on health and agriculture issues. He has also held posts in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, which are both near North Korea, and has sought deeper ties with Pyongyang. North Korea has battled chronic food shortages for decades.\n\n>**The delegation could give Chinese President Xi Jinping a chance to communicate with Kim before the North Korean leader is expected to travel to Russia next week for a meeting in Vladivostok with President Vladimir Putin.**\n\n>Russia\u2019s ambassador to North Korea, Alexander Matsegora, promised significant participation from his country in the celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of North Korea, he told state news service Tass. Sanctions imposed on the two in no way affect Moscow-Pyongyang ties, he added.\n\n>White House officials have said they believe talks between Kim and Putin will focus on arms transfers from North Korea to help the Kremlin\u2019s war machine in Ukraine. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned Pyongyang it would \u201cpay a price\u201d for providing weapons.\n\n>North Korea holds vast stores of munitions that can be fired from the Soviet-era weaponry that Russia relies upon for its war, now in its second year. The New York Times has reported Kim is looking for food aid from Russia and help building a nuclear-powered submarine and deploying spy satellites.\n\nIntriguing. They had an analyst on who said this meeting was very unusual and that the Chinese side may want to lay preconditions on any deal before KJU's trip. Speculation but seems like China may not want to lose the extent of its leverage over NK if NK can expand bilateral ties with Russia. While Putin is fighting for his near-term survival and has probably thrown posterity out the window, China may not want a dynastical nuclear-armed dictatorship at its border with advanced military capabilities that's capable of even thinking of approaching balance in the asymmetrical power dynamics between the two.",

You are making some statements for which you have no evidence of and some definitely outright wrong.  \n\nYou can credibly accuse KJU of many things but being a deranged lunatic is not one of them.  He has survived - some might argue thrived - 10+ years in a tough geopolitical box and you can't do it while being deranged.  He has pursued and so far is on track to achieve his own rational goal of dying of old age/natural causes in his bed like his dad and grandpa, unlike other tin pot dictators like Muammar Gaddafi or Muammar Gaddafi\n\nAs to \"possible proliferation\" to South Korea or Japan, Japanese public is very pacifying and fervently anti-nuclear despite the multiple ballistic missiles dropping on ocean between Japan and North Korea every year and some even went over the Japanese islands into the main Pacific ocean.  It's very unlikely that Japan will get nuclear weapons on its own thus not a concern as far PRC.  For South Korea, it's more of a concern.  The Korean public is definitely trending toward getting nukes of their own b/c the US nuclear umbrella has some leaks.  But there are some 50-60 nukes already in Korean peninsula.  If South Korea were to get 50 nukes on its own for deterrence vs NK, that hardly changes the strategic balance vis a vis PRC and Korean peninsula.  And to clarify, all of this discussion about additional nukes are not about a reality rather some possible future which may or may not happen.  South Korea nor Japan have nuclear weapons today.  And you are saying PRC should pay the \"upfront cost\" so that this doesn't become a reality.\n\nAs to that \"upfront cost\", what exactly do you have in mind that PRC/Xi could do **NOW** \\- not oh PRC should've stopped NK from getting the nuke - that could make the situation **better for PRC**?

Infantry units are not regularly being trained to shoot at distances of 500+ meters, which is where the XM7 would truly shine. </p>\n\n<p>There are general improvements from the NGSW program I like, like making suppressors available across the force to those that will be using the XM7, and the XM157 optic truly is groundbreaking, but it\u2019s overkill for your average solider\u2019s needs. The XM7 itself doesn\u2019t seem to be a bad rifle either, Sig\u2019s mountain of QC issues notwithstanding, but this feels like the second coming of the M14.</p>\n</div>",

The Air Force and Army get to produce 1 complicated system 100 times. The Navy has to produce 100 unique systems and then knit them all together into one functional unit. A failure in any one of those could doom the other 99 functional parts(see: Zumwalt). The F-35 could mass-produce its way out of its growing pains. You can't do that with an LCS or Ford-class.\n\nUnique strains: US shipbuilding has atrophied much worse than US automobile manufacturing or US aircraft design.

Politicians tend to portray their opponents' positions in simple cause-and-effect terms because they *need* a clear-cut us vs. them struggle story, so they can't leave room for nuance or overlapping reasons, but we shouldn't fall in the same trap.\n\nFurthermore it's extremely important to remember:\n\n1. That isolationism and non-interventionism *both have ample tradition* in the American system, and on both sides of the isle. The Republican party, in particular, has always had non-interventionist figures. It was only around the mid-sixties or so that the Republican conservatives were, by and large, rallied behind an interventionist policy, but it wasn't always like that, and it was never universally like that. The American right wing has had anti-intervenionist elements throughout the 20th and 21th century.\n2. One doesn't need to be a Russian sympathiser to support some of the causes that the Russian political establishment (or any other) also supports. It makes every sense for the Russian government to support some isolationist figures because, obviously, their interests overlap. But just like not inter-war non-interventionists were fascist sympathisers, not all current non-interventionists are Russian sympathisers.\n3. There are plenty of people who advocate for not intervening in some conflicts without necessarily holding an *ideology* of isolationism or non-interventionism. See e.g. [here](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/01/sloppy-journalism-at-the-new-york-times/).\n\nAs for the actual reasons, there's an extraordinary diversity of reasons, including:\n\n* A real and legitimate fear of escalation. There are people in the right-wing electoral base who are, for better or for worse, the sons and grandsons of Vietnam veterans, who fear long foreign entanglement both because they remember what it did to their parents and grandparents and because they don't trust the government's ability to extricate itself from dangerous engagements.\n* Real economic and security climate concerns. The American public is sensitive to \"the economy\" (and doesn't care about foreign policy *that* much), and much of it is in a financially brittle position, so they really do care about anything that might further degrade their financial position. Politicians obviously have an eye on that because they can turn that kind of concern into votes.\n* Lots of entrepreneurs have an eye on that, too, because that kind of concern has real impact on sales and long-term regulatory legislation. If you're selling luxury items, overpriced cars, entertainment services and the like, a harsher economic climate can really drain your sales. If you're providing private services that exploit legislative voids or under-regulation (Internet news, social media) or areas that were, for a while, under-funded by government initiatives (aerospace), a harsher security climate can quickly fill legislative voids or sharpen competition, making business models based on \"disruption\" very difficult to implement.\n* A real matter of remoteness -- some people really don't think the Black Sea region is that important, don't think the security of Europe is vital to that of the US, and don't understand why it's so important to help defend a remote European region.\n* Historical isolationism (it's still a thing; some people really just think the US should sever international trade and security ties and cut military spending to the minimum required to keep a credible nuclear deterrent)\n* Good ol' personal conviction -- lots of people hold various beliefs for no reason in particular. In fact I suspect most of us do. There are things that I support for no other reason than that I think they're right.\n* Anti-semitism, fascist sympathies etc..\n\nNone of these are universal. Public opinion is heavily polarized so there are lots of people who would have you think it's just the last one, but really it's not.\n\nAs for why Musk in particular is doing this, I think it's a combination of delusions of grandeur (holding high-level conferences with representatives of a foreign state is something even most CEOs don't get to do), a significant overlap between his highly vocal fan base and some of the, um, less savoury isolationist communities, and a real concern for his companies' position, all of which would face significant risk (and, in Tesla's case, barely any opportunities) not just in case of a prolongued conflict, but also in the scenario of a long-term Cold War-style polarisation.",
