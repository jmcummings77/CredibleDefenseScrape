The facility that is producing PrSM is set to have a *maximum annual run rate of between 200-300 units per year*, assuming production ramps up and also assuming the Army actually takes the tooling extension provision for FY24, if it doesn't then production will settle between 100-200 units per year.\n\nCurrently procurement of PrSM is set to reach 110 for FY2024. This means that for FY2024 the Army is procuring, awarding a contract, for 110 units to be produced.

Procurement expectations are currently lagging about three years behind what they were going to be just last year. This isn't entirely unreasonable, new missile programs always have teething issues, but it's a great example as to why we need to be careful not to rush ahead.",

They're infatuated with the idea of convinced arms, they're just not well equipped, trained and organized to pull it off regularly. While they're actually decent at some aspects of ground warfare, where they were weak was the tactical side of combat maneuver units. And the one part of  the combined arms they were seriously lacking last summer was dismounted infantry troops. \n\nPart of the issue was due to the fact that they entered the war with most BTG infantry companies grossly understaffed. Nowhere was that worse than infantry squads, where they often averaged only a couple dismounts per vehicle. Then they took casualties in the war, lots, and especially among their dismounts. Which they couldn't replace. Because losses were so high and replacements so few, most Russian infantry units were barely combat effective by the summer.

Despite anticipated increases in crude oil output cuts at the beginning of the next year, market sentiment suggests that the cartel's supply remains sufficient for a decelerating global economy. Russia extended its voluntary crude oil export reduction of 300,000 barrels per day through March 2024 and introduced an additional 200,000 barrel-per-day cut in fuel exports.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Isn&#39;t necessarily directly connected to the price cap, but the Urals oil has broken through the &#39;psychological barrier&#39; of $60 (broken through the opposite way, to clarify):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/urals-oil\">TradingEconomics: Urals Oil, Dec 08 2023</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian Urals crude oil prices dipped below $61 per barrel, the lowest in five months, mirroring the broader decline in global crude benchmarks after OPEC+ established output levels for the first quarter of 2024. Despite anticipated increases in crude oil output cuts at the beginning of the next year, market sentiment suggests that the cartel&#39;s supply remains sufficient for a decelerating global economy. Russia extended its voluntary crude oil export reduction of 300,000 barrels per day through March 2024 and introduced an additional 200,000 barrel-per-day cut in fuel exports. While these measures reduce Russian oil in international markets, they coincide with recent laws encouraging domestic fuel sales, responding to capacity challenges faced by Russian refiners. Meanwhile, there are reports of Russia&#39;s clandestine tanker operations successfully navigating the EU and G7 oil embargo, enabling the export of energy at prices exceeding the $60 per barrel ceiling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ticker stands at <strong>$56</strong>.</p>\n</div>",

It doesn\u2019t hold a lot of concrete ideas to lead to an actual victory. And there really isn\u2019t a case that it argues for more weapons, just faster delivery (speed of relevance). In all, it\u2019s just a messaging document that I feel is aimed more at Republicans than anyone else.\n\n**Page 1**: Literally just a page about how terrible Biden is. \n\n**Page 2**: \n\nHas the Proposed Plan for Victory summary. Interesting because the first paragraph reads:\n\n>Biden\u2019s mantra of supporting Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d is a losing strategy. Instead, House Republicans believe **President Biden should present a credible plan for victory and arm Ukraine with the weapons it needs to win as soon as possible**.\n\nSo not exactly proposing a plan except proposing that Biden presents a plan. Which would require the Ukrainian government to propose a plan, which is quite difficult as war makes planning like that hard. But let's move from that and look at the general outline of what they want. \n\n>A path to victory for Ukraine will require (1) providing critical weapons to Ukraine at the speed of relevance, (2) tightening sanctions on the Putin regime, and (3) transferring frozen Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine. \n\nThe next paragraph shows their end goal.\n\n>This strategy will ensure Ukraine is able to make the needed advances on the battlefield to force Putin to the negotiating table. If Ukraine doesn\u2019t negotiate from a position of strength, there can be no lasting peace.\n\nSo negotiating is the end goal. Despite the reflexive pushback against any negotiations, all wars have ended in either negotiation or the complete conquest of one side. As the second option isn\u2019t likely to happen, negotiations will have to take place.\n\n**Page 3**: \n\nTitled the Unholy Alliance. New Axis of Evil rhetoric with Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Only thing of substance is a paragraph about Iranian sanctions relief and $6bn in unfrozen assets is Biden funding Iran. \n\n**Page 4**: \n\nStates that Republicans want to continue to prioritize oversight, and that no misspent money has been found. And talks about how Europe buying new arms strengthens NATO and gives American defense industry work.\n\n**Page 5**\n\nTalks about how the US is by GDP is 30th in total assistance, 14th in security assistance, and \u201cHouse Republicans need to push our allies to continue this positive trend\u201d. It also has a paragraph about how the funding provided has degraded Russia without a loss of American life, and how we must keep doing it lest Russia wins and invades a NATO ally. There\u2019s a Ronald Reagan quote, and a couple of paragraphs stating how the war has helped start restoring the American defense industry.\n\n**Page 6**\n\nTalks about how bad Russia is, how Trump knew that only strength mattered, that Biden\u2019s sanctions have loopholes, singling out stricter oil sanction enforcement. Talks about how Biden that American deterrence is crumbling, lots of \u201cBiden is weak\u201d rhetoric.\n\n**Page 7**: A conclusion paragraph about how American must keep supporting Ukraine because America carries the torch for freedom and democracy for the world.\n\n**Page 8-10**\n\nOversight Section. States no mis-use of funds, that Democrats didn\u2019t want oversight, but then continues on about how strong the oversight has been. Lays out how oversight is conducted. Interesting for the view into it, including equipment serial number tracking. The end talks about additional oversight wanted, but goes onto page 11 before laying it out. \n\n**Page 11**\n\nSome standard reporting and publishing wants, but these stick out:\n\n> * Ukraine Victory Strategy \u2013 Requires the administration to submit a much-delayed strategy to Congress for U.S. support to Ukraine within 60 days of enactment that also must be published on the State Department\u2019s website for public transparency.\n> * Purposes of the Funds \u2013 Prohibits the administration from funding misguided priorities like climate and other woke programs.\n> * Cost Matching Requirement \u2013 Requires other donors to provide more than half of\nnon-security funds for U.S. dollars to move.\n\nThe Victory Strategy seems to stretch what oversight is. The climate and woke provision is actually oversight, but also much more about messaging than real expenditure. But the big one is the cost matching requirements. Basically unless 50+1 funds come from somewhere else, the money doesn\u2019t move. That would be a big constraint on provision of funds. Even if money is there, how does one keep track of that? Is it pledged or actually donated? Who moves first? Lots of ways to slow provision down.\n\n**Page 12**: Just about how they\u2019d give authority to certain Inspector Generals to oversee the above.\n\n**Page 13**: Has a chart about burden sharing. Give the total amounts and as percent of GDP.\n\n**Page 14**: Talks about NATO ally investment into their own militaries and their contributions to Ukraine. \n\n**Page 15**: Talks about Pacific allies' contributions to Ukraine. Ends with non-security assistance amounts from Europe versus US.\n\n**Page 16**: Talks about amount of refugees from Ukraine has taken in.\n\n**Page 17**: Has some pie charts showing different types of assistance given and the balance between US/Europe\n\n**Page 18-23**\n\nA big paragraph and a timeline about how Biden has failed on Ukraine from 2014 to the present focusing on how he should have given equipment faster. Only interesting thing about strategy is:\n\n>Instead, the strategy should be to give Ukraine the resources it needs to win now, and inflict maximum pressure on the Russian economy, so that this conflict can be brought to an end.\n\n**Overall**\n\nInterestingly, Frozen Assets are only mentioned 3 times: in the two summary paragraphs, and at the end. I'm also going to make fun of this phrase:\n\n>Providing critical weapons to Ukraine at the speed of relevance**\n\nWhile I understand what they're trying to get at, \"the speed of relevance\" is one the most political non-phrases ever. Sounds good, doesn't have an actual meaning. \n\nOverall, this document feels more like messaging aimed at Republicans to reassure or persuade them on Ukraine funding. Lots of \u201cBiden bad and weak\u201d rhetoric (have to put down the other party), a lot about how oversight is working (rebuts the mis-used funds rhetoric), and how much Europe is contributing (rebuts freeloader rhetoric). But there\u2019 nothing about how much more equipment is needed and the money it would cost, or needed funds for investment in ammunition production, or how to get to that proposed $300-$400bn number (though that might have been too close to the release). I get why it isn\u2019t in there since the exact needs are fluid, but Ukraine\u2019s general needs aren\u2019t exactly secret. They need AFVs, artillery, ammunition, AA systems, and planes. All these things have some idea of numbers and as such cost. I get why they wouldn\u2019t want it for political reasons, because once you put something firm on paper it can be attacked or set a topline negotiating point.

In those days the formations of the Central Military District were still arriving from Svatove/Kreminna, according to the Ukrainians it was a Russian strategy in order not to let the formers notice a buildup of Russian units in the Avdiivka sector. On the north-eastern flank the 114th Motorized Brigade attacked in the Terrikon area and towards the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway from Krasnohorivka (supported, on the infantry side, by smaller units of the 1st Corps, regiments of the Territorial Forces and the \"Yugra\" Battalion). On the southern flank, the 9th \"Marine\" Brigade attacked from Vodyane and the 1st Motorized Brigade from Opytne, supported by smaller units of the 1st Corps and regiments of the Territorial Forces (including the 504th Tank Regiment).\n\nFrom the following days, the first units of the Central Military District began to enter the scene, particularly the 2nd CAA in the north-east flank. Both the 15th and 21st Motorized Brigades were deployed in the direction of Stepove and the Coke Plant, respectively. In particular, the BTR-82As massacre on Oct. 19 involved the 15th Motorized Brigade. Late October also saw the arrival of the 239th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division, which was involved in some limited actions. The last maneuver brigade of the 2nd CAA (the 30th Motorized Brigade) began to be fully employed in late November, and as we speak it's pushing towards Stepove. The 15th Motorized Brigade together with the elements of the 132nd Motorized Brigade (this one from the 1st Corps) are fighting in the direction of Novokalynove while the 21st Motorized Brigade in the direction of the Avdiivka sand quarry. The (considerably weakened) 114th Motorized Brigade is fighting near the Coke Plant. At the beginning of December the Russians transferred as a reserve to this flank the 9th Motorized Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet, brought here from the northern flank of Bakhmut. \n\n\nIn the southern flank the Russians introduced the 41st CAA in the days following Oct. 10: the 55th Mountain Brigade has been active in the Opytne/Spartak area ever since. Since late October elements of the 35th Motorized Brigade have entered the scene in the Vodyane area. There's certainly also the 74th Motorized Brigade just in the rear (so far it has seen some limited action) and perhaps other elements of the 90th Tank Division. Along with numerous smaller units of the 1st Corps. There is also the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, which operates Lancets.\n\nIn the area of the Avdiivka industrial zone, also called Promka (which saw no mechanized attacks, with the tanks used as assault guns), from the first days of the offensive the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps became active together with units of the 1st Corps such as the \"Pyatnashka\" Battalion and the 87th Motorized Regiment. To support the attacks in this area the Russians transferred several assault and reconnaissance brigades of the \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\" such as \"Hispaniola\", \"Veterany\", and probably \"Convoy\" (the BARS-11 detachment became a battalion of the latter). They are all former PMCs linked to Redut, in fact reinforced battalions and not brigades.\n\nThe losses are plentiful and the progress in both flanks has been very limited. I think they will have to bring in new units soon. Most likely, first and foremost, the rest of the 90th Tank Division.",

A T-90M from the 239th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division was lost in mid-November. Earlier this month, several BMP-3s were lost, probably belonging to a unit of the Central Military District.</p>\n\n<p>The standard equipment of the 1st Corps are T-64BV, T-72B(3) and T-80BV as MBTs and generally BMP-1s as IFVs. The Central Military District deploys the last two of the aforementioned types of tanks and generally BMP-2 and BTR-82A as IFVs (but for example they also have BMP-1s, it&#39;s not so linear). In any case, the 1st and 2nd Corps, compared to the average of the Russian Army, have usually the worst equipment. For reasons, generally the formations of the Eastern Military District also tend to have worse equipment than others (except the brigades of the Pacific Fleet). Certain CAAs (such as the 6th of the WMD and the 49th of the SMD) are generally equipped considerably worse than the average of their own military districts. The 41st CAA of the CMD at the beginning of the war was badly equipped, fielding T-72A/Bs and BMP-1s in several units even before the invasion of Ukraine.  During the war it received several T-90Ms among others, though.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Non frontline combat news:\n\n**Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)**\n\n> Udmurt Republic Head Alexander Brechalov announced on December 7 that the region formed and will soon deploy four new units to fight in Ukraine.[75] Brechalov stated that the newly-formed \u201dYevgeniy Dragunov\u201d Separate Anti-Aircraft Missile Battalion, the \u201cCheptsa\u201d Anti-Aircraft Missile Division, the \u201cVarmun\u201d Motorized Battalion, and the \u201dKama\u201d Air Assault (VDV) Division will soon deploy to Ukraine. Brechalov claimed that Udmurt residents staffed these new units after signing unspecified contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD). These units appear to be Russian irregular formations with unknown strengths that likely do not correspond with the doctrinal end strengths of their reported echelons. Authorities in the Republic of Udmurtia are likely recruiting local volunteers to staff these units to immediately reinforce the frontlines in Ukraine.\n\n> The Russian MoD claimed that Russia further simplified the procedure for issuing combat veteran certificates for participants of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian MoD announced on December 8 that Russian fighters will no longer need to apply to receive their veteran certificates because the MoD will automatically issue these certificates based on the already-available information about the combatant.[76] The simplification of this procedure may be part of an ongoing Russian formalization effort that seeks to reestablish Russia\u2019s administrative control over irregular forces involved in the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n> Russian regional authorities continued efforts to forcibly coerce migrants into military service. Russian opposition and local outlets reported that Udmurt military police raided a migrant community in Izhevsk and reportedly will force migrant men aged 18 to 27 into military service.[77] Udmurt officials are reportedly offering to allow migrant men older than 27 to sign a contract with the Russian MoD to fight in Ukraine. Vladivostok City officials reportedly conducted a similar raid on migrant taxi drivers and issued summonses to the military registration office to 10 detained migrants.[78] BBC\u2019s Russia service reported that Russian officials also recruited detained migrants who attempted to cross the Russian-Finnish border to fight in Ukraine before returning some of these migrants to the Republic of Karelia from Rostov Oblast.[79] BBC\u2019s Russia service reported that some migrants refused to deploy to Ukraine after realizing that Russia intended to commit them to battle in exchange for dropping their deportation cases.\n\n> Russia reportedly continues to defend its border with Ukraine with a limited number of conscripts. A Russian conscript told Russian outlet Mozhem Obyasnit (We Can Explain) that there are almost no Russian border guards defending the Russian state border in Bryansk Oblast.[80] The conscript claimed that at least 10 conscripts had died as a result of shelling on the Russian-Ukrainian state border.\n\n**Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that Russian forces are trying to copy Ukrainian naval drones that have been targeting the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF).[81] GUR Representative Andriy Yusov stated that Russian forces are collecting fragments of Ukrainian naval drones and are trying to improve their drone production.\n\n> A Ukrainian head of a volunteer organization stated that Russia is actively relying on automatic optical drone navigation and that Ukraine does not have a systematic way to counteract Russian automation.[82] Head of the Ukrainian \u201dVictory Drones\u201d volunteer initiative (and director of the Aerointelligence Support Center) Maria Berlinskaya stated that Russia is increasingly trying to automate its drones, shift towards automatic optical navigation, and move to launching \u201ddrone swarms\u201d to overwhelm Ukrainian forces. A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces have launched 3,083 Shahed 136/131 drones since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine based on data published by the Ukrainian General Staff.[83]\n\n> A Russian milblogger amplified footage purporting to show that Russian forces installed the first sets of \u201cSoltik-BL\u201d DMR AES256 radio communications systems for armored vehicles, which will allow these vehicles to receive a publicly available standard connection with relay capability.[84] The milblogger specified that volunteers produced the \u201cSoltik-BL\u201d DMR AES256 systems.\n\n> Radio Liberty\u2019s Schemes project found that Russian security services spied on Ukrainian state and private infrastructures since 2014 via thousands of security cameras that operated on Russian \u201cTRASSIR\u201d software belonging to the Russian \u201cDSSL\u201d company.[85] Schemes found that the companies storing information from these security cameras are linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\n**Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\n\n> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on December 8 that Russia is trying to destroy Ukrainian children\u2019s connection to Ukraine and that swift intervention is necessary to maintain children's Ukrainian identity during a speech at the first meeting of the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children.[86] Zelensky stated that forced deportation is one of Russia\u2018s most \u201dcynical\u201d war crimes and that Russian authorities are teaching children lies about Ukraine and the war.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Non frontline combat news:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Udmurt Republic Head Alexander Brechalov announced on December 7 that the region formed and will soon deploy four new units to fight in Ukraine.[75] Brechalov stated that the newly-formed \u201dYevgeniy Dragunov\u201d Separate Anti-Aircraft Missile Battalion, the \u201cCheptsa\u201d Anti-Aircraft Missile Division, the \u201cVarmun\u201d Motorized Battalion, and the \u201dKama\u201d Air Assault (VDV) Division will soon deploy to Ukraine. Brechalov claimed that Udmurt residents staffed these new units after signing unspecified contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD). These units appear to be Russian irregular formations with unknown strengths that likely do not correspond with the doctrinal end strengths of their reported echelons. Authorities in the Republic of Udmurtia are likely recruiting local volunteers to staff these units to immediately reinforce the frontlines in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian MoD claimed that Russia further simplified the procedure for issuing combat veteran certificates for participants of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Russian MoD announced on December 8 that Russian fighters will no longer need to apply to receive their veteran certificates because the MoD will automatically issue these certificates based on the already-available information about the combatant.[76] The simplification of this procedure may be part of an ongoing Russian formalization effort that seeks to reestablish Russia\u2019s administrative control over irregular forces involved in the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Russian regional authorities continued efforts to forcibly coerce migrants into military service. Russian opposition and local outlets reported that Udmurt military police raided a migrant community in Izhevsk and reportedly will force migrant men aged 18 to 27 into military service.[77] Udmurt officials are reportedly offering to allow migrant men older than 27 to sign a contract with the Russian MoD to fight in Ukraine. Vladivostok City officials reportedly conducted a similar raid on migrant taxi drivers and issued summonses to the military registration office to 10 detained migrants.[78] BBC\u2019s Russia service reported that Russian officials also recruited detained migrants who attempted to cross the Russian-Finnish border to fight in Ukraine before returning some of these migrants to the Republic of Karelia from Rostov Oblast.[79] BBC\u2019s Russia service reported that some migrants refused to deploy to Ukraine after realizing that Russia intended to commit them to battle in exchange for dropping their deportation cases.</p>\n\n<p>Russia reportedly continues to defend its border with Ukraine with a limited number of conscripts. A Russian conscript told Russian outlet Mozhem Obyasnit (We Can Explain) that there are almost no Russian border guards defending the Russian state border in Bryansk Oblast.[80] The conscript claimed that at least 10 conscripts had died as a result of shelling on the Russian-Ukrainian state border.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that Russian forces are trying to copy Ukrainian naval drones that have been targeting the Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF).[81] GUR Representative Andriy Yusov stated that Russian forces are collecting fragments of Ukrainian naval drones and are trying to improve their drone production.</p>\n\n<p>A Ukrainian head of a volunteer organization stated that Russia is actively relying on automatic optical drone navigation and that Ukraine does not have a systematic way to counteract Russian automation.[82] Head of the Ukrainian \u201dVictory Drones\u201d volunteer initiative (and director of the Aerointelligence Support Center) Maria Berlinskaya stated that Russia is increasingly trying to automate its drones, shift towards automatic optical navigation, and move to launching \u201ddrone swarms\u201d to overwhelm Ukrainian forces. A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces have launched 3,083 Shahed 136/131 drones since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine based on data published by the Ukrainian General Staff.[83]</p>\n\n<p>A Russian milblogger amplified footage purporting to show that Russian forces installed the first sets of \u201cSoltik-BL\u201d DMR AES256 radio communications systems for armored vehicles, which will allow these vehicles to receive a publicly available standard connection with relay capability.[84] The milblogger specified that volunteers produced the \u201cSoltik-BL\u201d DMR AES256 systems.</p>\n\n<p>Radio Liberty\u2019s Schemes project found that Russian security services spied on Ukrainian state and private infrastructures since 2014 via thousands of security cameras that operated on Russian \u201cTRASSIR\u201d software belonging to the Russian \u201cDSSL\u201d company.[85] Schemes found that the companies storing information from these security cameras are linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on December 8 that Russia is trying to destroy Ukrainian children\u2019s connection to Ukraine and that swift intervention is necessary to maintain children&#39;s Ukrainian identity during a speech at the first meeting of the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children.[86] Zelensky stated that forced deportation is one of Russia\u2018s most \u201dcynical\u201d war crimes and that Russian authorities are teaching children lies about Ukraine and the war. Zelensky noted that Russia\u2019s crimes against Ukrainian children and families are \u201dorganized\u201d efforts to erase the national identity of young Ukrainians.

This is what people forget when looking at just pure statistics (which, I should note, also say that the H-60 and V-22 are similar in mishap rates).\n\nAn H-60 doing search and rescue rescuing climbers on the side of a cliff at 10,000 feet where a helicopter is struggling with power is going to be in a significantly more dangerous situation than say, a transport, going from Point A to Point B with 10,000+ feet runways.\n\nSimilarly, a Navy fighter operating off a carrier is going to land and takeoff once a mission, but it is at much higher risk of a mishap than say an Air Force fighter landing and taking off from a nice 10,000+ foot runway.\n\nH-60s have been doing a much wider range of missions than the V-22 have, and the V-22 has had multiple features put into it specifically to limit its ability to exceed a very tightly controlled flight envelope.\n\nSpeaking of rates, [per the Naval Safety Center](https://navalsafetycommand.navy.mil/Portals/29/Documents/ANNUAL%20REPORT-Updated%20JUL15_compressed.pdf?ver=2020-07-16-143235-193), from FY14 to FY19, the H-60 rate in DoN service was around 1.8 Class A/100k flight hours. The V-22 was around 3.2 Class A/100k flight hours. \n\nClass A's isn't necessarily perfect, but it IS the standard by which the military goes by for mishaps, and it's clear that the V-22 has a higher rate than the H-60 in the DoN (and with the most recent USAF mishap, it's also higher than the lifetime rate of the H-60 in USAF service, which stretches back to the 80s when we had different safety standards)\n\n>So for the last five crashes, only one was due to mechanical issues related to the airframe. Of the last five fatal crashes, only 1-2 are. Midair collisions have nothing to do with the airframe itself. \n\nThis brings up another point: there is a HUGE difference between mishaps. \n\nA mishap caused by pilot error is a very different issue with safety compared to a mishap caused by mechanical failure.\n\nIn the past few decades, the vast majority of mishaps are caused by pilot error (which can include misdiagnosing a mechanical issue). \n\nAs you wrote, midair collisions are pilot error (e.g., due to loss of situational awareness, spatial disorientation, etc.). Aerial refueling? Possibly due to pilot technique.\n\nThose mishaps? We can learn from them. We can teach better techniques. We can use better Crew Resource Management. We can skip that part of the mission entirely due to Operational Risk Management.\n\nMishaps caused by mechanical failure that result in catastrophic unrecoverable loss? \n\nThere's not much to learn from that for aircrew. You can only hope and pray the program office and branch addresses the issue before it happens again. \n\nTHAT's why the V-22 has a dangerous reputation, even amongst military aviators. \n\nI can learn from the guy who didn't do an AGSM and GLOCs and dies. I can learn from the guy who misdiagnosed an emegercy procedure.

She leads [Victory Drones](https://en.victory-drones.com/), a volunteer project run by the Dignitas charitable foundation, and is the director of the Aerial Reconnaissance Support Centre.\n> \n> Berlinska believes that the only way the situation can now be saved is for the president to have personal control over the development of Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance. So she is proposing that a technology-focused Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief be set up, with involvement from leading Ukrainian drone manufacturers.\n> \n> Advertisement:\n> \n>   What results could this deliver?\n> \n> How should those who have been failing to develop Ukraine's defence industry for years now be held accountable for their mistakes?\n> \n> Has the Ukrainian government begun to understand the importance of aerial reconnaissance?\n> \n> Ukrainska Pravda spoke to Mariia Berlinska about all these issues and more.\n> \n> Below is an abridged version of our conversation. The full interview is available in Ukrainian on our YouTube channel.\n> \n> ## **\"Drones give you an opportunity to see in a matter of minutes what reconnaissance would take a couple of weeks to find out\"**\n> \n> **Do you remember the day when drones first came into your life?**\n> \n> I remember it well. It was the summer of 2014.\n> \n> I\u2019d been looking for an opportunity to volunteer for the front line. I\u2019d called many battalions and was always rejected once people heard a woman's voice on the phone.\n> \n> One battalion didn\u2019t reject me, but asked whether I had ever worked with technology. I answered honestly that I hadn\u2019t. They asked whether I knew anything about drones. Again, I said no. They asked whether I had any technical education.\n> \n> Eventually this person asked, with their voice full of hopelessness, whether I was at least ready to learn. And I was. That was the beginning of my journey in this field.\n> \n> I only had a few days of training before going to the front. The first drone that I worked on directly was in Luhansk Oblast. It was the \"great-grandfather\" of Mavic \u2013 the Phantom 2, which had a flight range of just a few hundred metres.\n> \n> Advertisement:\n> \n> It was an interesting feeling, because it was an opportunity to see in a matter of minutes what reconnaissance would take a couple of weeks to find out.\n> \n> One of my first drone flights was from [Metalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalist,_Luhansk_Raion,_Luhansk_Oblast). That was the first time I saw the occupied city of Luhansk. Our task was to reconnoitre the situation.\n> \n> These were the early days of September 2014, and it was our last checkpoint before the line of contact near Vesela Hora. We didn\u2019t know what lay beyond it. The commander who was with us warned us honestly that we might not come back.\n> \n> Later, when years had gone by and we\u2019d gained experience, we realised that we shouldn't have done that. Probably the only reason we weren\u2019t shot then and there was because the enemy didn\u2019t believe anyone could be so arrogant.\n> \n> [\u00a0](https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/8/a/8acdb52-ea00d55-avdiivka---18-.jpg) \n> \n> **How easy was it for you to join a field that requires a lot of technical knowledge?**\n> \n> We are not born with any knowledge. We are always learning. If you have the motivation and desire to learn, you will succeed.\n> \n> Now we are teaching servicemen and women to fly FPV (first-person view) drones. And it\u2019s difficult, because FPV in unmanned aerial vehicles is considered a kind of aerobatics. The training takes at least a few weeks, and if there's an engineering component, it takes a good month.\n> \n> **Can anyone be taught to fly a drone?**\n> \n> If you really want to, then practically anyone can do it. We\u2019ve had cases of people in their 60s, with concussion, who were very persistent and spent a lot of time on it, spending whole nights flying on simulators.\n> \n> **If you had to name the most talented students that you\u2019ve personally taught aerial reconnaissance, who would they be?**\n> \n> Of the people I\u2019ve trained directly, probably [Masi Nayyem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGYEIHsgnhA) [a Ukrainian lawyer, human rights activist, Armed Forces soldier and brother of the politician Mustafa Nayyem]. That was in Avdiivka in 2016. It took me just a few hours to explain the basic rules of operating a multirotor to him, and he picked it up very quickly.\n> \n> Later, they [Nayyem\u2019s unit \u2013 ed.] held the industrial zone near Avdiivka largely because they were able to send a drone up above them and see what was there (the distances were symbolic \u2013 50, 70 or 100 metres to the enemy). This enabled them to control the perimeter.\n> \n> Masi is really talented. Overall, I think we\u2019re all lucky to have him.\n> \n> [\u00a0](https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/c/8/c8cc60e-342c892-avdiivka---15-.jpg) \n> \n> ## **\"Now we are paying in people\u2019s lives for mistakes that have been made over many years\"**\n> \n> **Have there been any battles during the full-scale war so far in which drones played a decisive role?**\n> \n> I don\u2019t think there have been any significant battles during the full-scale invasion where drones haven\u2019t been involved, because if you don't have drones, you are fighting blind: the enemy can see you, but you can't see them. In addition, a drone gives you an opportunity to destroy enemy equipment cheaply, accurately and on a large scale.\n> \n> Therefore, the side with the best technology will always have the advantage. It\u2019s an absolute must-have in modern warfare. No battle or operation is possible without it now.\n> \n> Advertisement:\n> \n> **You often reiterate that the state isn\u2019t paying enough attention to aerial reconnaissance nowadays.**\n> \n> **It's now 2023.

She leads <a href=\"https://en.victory-drones.com/\">Victory Drones</a>, a volunteer project run by the Dignitas charitable foundation, and is the director of the Aerial Reconnaissance Support Centre.</p>\n\n<p>Berlinska believes that the only way the situation can now be saved is for the president to have personal control over the development of Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance. So she is proposing that a technology-focused Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief be set up, with involvement from leading Ukrainian drone manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p>Advertisement:</p>\n\n<p>What results could this deliver?</p>\n\n<p>How should those who have been failing to develop Ukraine&#39;s defence industry for years now be held accountable for their mistakes?</p>\n\n<p>Has the Ukrainian government begun to understand the importance of aerial reconnaissance?</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainska Pravda spoke to Mariia Berlinska about all these issues and more.</p>\n\n<p>Below is an abridged version of our conversation. The full interview is available in Ukrainian on our YouTube channel.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>&quot;Drones give you an opportunity to see in a matter of minutes what reconnaissance would take a couple of weeks to find out&quot;</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Do you remember the day when drones first came into your life?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I remember it well. It was the summer of 2014.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d been looking for an opportunity to volunteer for the front line. I\u2019d called many battalions and was always rejected once people heard a woman&#39;s voice on the phone.</p>\n\n<p>One battalion didn\u2019t reject me, but asked whether I had ever worked with technology. I answered honestly that I hadn\u2019t. They asked whether I knew anything about drones. Again, I said no. They asked whether I had any technical education.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually this person asked, with their voice full of hopelessness, whether I was at least ready to learn. And I was. That was the beginning of my journey in this field.</p>\n\n<p>I only had a few days of training before going to the front. The first drone that I worked on directly was in Luhansk Oblast. It was the &quot;great-grandfather&quot; of Mavic \u2013 the Phantom 2, which had a flight range of just a few hundred metres.</p>\n\n<p>Advertisement:</p>\n\n<p>It was an interesting feeling, because it was an opportunity to see in a matter of minutes what reconnaissance would take a couple of weeks to find out.</p>\n\n<p>One of my first drone flights was from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalist,_Luhansk_Raion,_Luhansk_Oblast\">Metalist</a>. That was the first time I saw the occupied city of Luhansk. Our task was to reconnoitre the situation.</p>\n\n<p>These were the early days of September 2014, and it was our last checkpoint before the line of contact near Vesela Hora. We didn\u2019t know what lay beyond it. The commander who was with us warned us honestly that we might not come back.</p>\n\n<p>Later, when years had gone by and we\u2019d gained experience, we realised that we shouldn&#39;t have done that. Probably the only reason we weren\u2019t shot then and there was because the enemy didn\u2019t believe anyone could be so arrogant.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/8/a/8acdb52-ea00d55-avdiivka---18-.jpg\">\u00a0</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>How easy was it for you to join a field that requires a lot of technical knowledge?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are not born with any knowledge. We are always learning. If you have the motivation and desire to learn, you will succeed.</p>\n\n<p>Now we are teaching servicemen and women to fly FPV (first-person view) drones. And it\u2019s difficult, because FPV in unmanned aerial vehicles is considered a kind of aerobatics. The training takes at least a few weeks, and if there&#39;s an engineering component, it takes a good month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can anyone be taught to fly a drone?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you really want to, then practically anyone can do it. We\u2019ve had cases of people in their 60s, with concussion, who were very persistent and spent a lot of time on it, spending whole nights flying on simulators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you had to name the most talented students that you\u2019ve personally taught aerial reconnaissance, who would they be?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of the people I\u2019ve trained directly, probably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGYEIHsgnhA\">Masi Nayyem</a> [a Ukrainian lawyer, human rights activist, Armed Forces soldier and brother of the politician Mustafa Nayyem]. That was in Avdiivka in 2016. It took me just a few hours to explain the basic rules of operating a multirotor to him, and he picked it up very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Later, they [Nayyem\u2019s unit \u2013 ed.] held the industrial zone near Avdiivka largely because they were able to send a drone up above them and see what was there (the distances were symbolic \u2013 50, 70 or 100 metres to the enemy). This enabled them to control the perimeter.</p>\n\n<p>Masi is really talented. Overall, I think we\u2019re all lucky to have him.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/c/8/c8cc60e-342c892-avdiivka---15-.jpg\">\u00a0</a> </p>\n\n<h2><strong>&quot;Now we are paying in people\u2019s lives for mistakes that have been made over many years&quot;</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Have there been any battles during the full-scale war so far in which drones played a decisive role?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think there have been any significant battles during the full-scale invasion where drones haven\u2019t been involved, because if you don&#39;t have drones, you are fighting blind: the enemy can see you, but you can&#39;t see them. In addition, a drone gives you an opportunity to destroy enemy equipment cheaply, accurately and on a large scale.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the side with the best technology will always have the advantage. It\u2019s an absolute must-have in modern warfare. No battle or operation is possible without it now.</p>\n\n<p>Advertisement:</p>\n\n<p><strong>You often reiterate that the state isn\u2019t paying enough attention to aerial reconnaissance nowadays.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It&#39;s now 2023. But you were saying basically the same thing back in 2014, and I quote: &quot;The state still has no understanding that aerial reconnaissance is a strategic and priority area.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The government has changed since then, and the intensity of the war has increased.

Most of the drones operated by Ukraine are civilian grade drones with high resolution cameras at best. There are a few that have FLIR or night vision capabilities, but the VAST majority are just regular cameras whose operation can be deterred by something as simple as smoke.\n\nIn fact, RUSI even brought this up in their [post-mortem of the Ukrainian counteroffensive](https://static.rusi.org/Stormbreak-Special-Report-web-final_0.pdf):\n\n> Only 3% of Ukrainian artillery-fire missions are smoke missions. As demonstrated during the assault on the company position north of Rivnopil, smoke can be extremely useful in confusing the enemy ground force and obscuring assault actions. But smoke also has the effect of obscuring the view from UAVs which higher Ukrainian echelons and command posts use to coordinate activity and conduct combat management. **Commanders persistently prioritise maintaining their own understanding of the battlefield over laying down smoke and concealing their personnel\u2019s movements.** Given the criticality of rapid application of artillery to support movement, this prioritisation is understandable, but it also reflects limitations in the ability of the brigade to trust tactical commanders to execute actions when not directed by high headquarters with greater situational awareness.\n\nThe bolded part is my own emphasis, but it's important. By prioritizing drones to gain SA rather than depending on the reports of subordinates on the ground, commanders are depriving those same subordinates the *obscuration* needed to mask their point of effort.

The US trains subordinate commanders (PL and SL) appropriately to be able to report up relevant information to help their commanding officers build a more complete battle picture. The flow of information is what makes the US military the deadly killing machine that it is. Even if you forced US PLs and SLs to rely on radios alone (and most of them do), that flow of information will still happen and the CO or BC will have equal or more SA than Ukrainian commanders addicted to live drone feeds.",

But it\u2019s nowhere near enough for a war of this scale. The Ministry of Digital Transformation has tried to close the gap. And whatever anyone says, I am certain that if Fedorov [Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov] and his team hadn\u2019t taken this on, our losses would have been even more significant. Of course mistakes have been made, of course not everything has gone smoothly, but they were coming into a field where there was really no one and nothing at the time. What they\u2019ve done deserves recognition and gratitude from society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YoEL1KD60s\"><strong>Arsen Zhumadilov</strong></a><strong>, the head of the newly created State Logistics Operator, wants his agency to be in charge of the procurement of non-combat drones for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Is this a good idea?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why not? If it makes the [procurement] process quick.</p>\n\n<p>Every day is costing us. Obviously, during a war, neither side says how many people they are losing. And believe me, there may be days when the number of people killed and wounded can be up to a thousand.</p>\n\n<p>Time is not on our side right now. The sooner the tech stuff is purchased, and the more the government invests in this area and prioritises it, the more people will stay alive. Where there are no drones, people are becoming disposable items.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d even go so far as to say that this isn\u2019t even a stalemate on the chessboard now: we\u2019re on the point of losing the war.

Russian opposition outlet Baza reported on December 7 that the Russian military has issued military summonses to over 350 recently naturalized Russian citizens since the beginning of October 2023, including over 200 in November 2023.[73] Baza stated that Russian Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) Head Vladimir Kolokoltsev launched an operation on October 1 aimed at detaining and issuing military summonses to recently naturalized Russian citizens who had not registered with the Russian military.[74] Employees of military registration and enlistment offices, local police officers, and military investigators from the Russian Investigative Committee reportedly conduct these detentions.[75]\n\n**Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> Russian state outlet RIA Novosti reported on December 7 that a Russian government source claimed that Russian forces intend to use 40N6 long-range missiles in S-400 missile systems in conjunction with Beriev A-50U long-range radar detection aircraft (NATO reporting name: Mainstay) to shoot down Ukrainian F-16 fighter jets once those begin operating.[76] The source also told RIA Novosti that Russian forces would likely primarily use 40N6 missiles as well as fighter aircraft to attempt to destroy Ukrainian F-16.[77]\n\n> Udmurtia Republic Governor Alexander Brechalov stated on December 6 that the Republic of Udmurtia currently produces 10 percent of all Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during a speech at the Russia International Exhibition and Forum in Moscow.[78] Brechalov also announced that Udmurtia intends to produce half of Russia\u2019s total UAV fleet by 2030.[79] Udmurtia Republic Government First Deputy Chairperson Olga Abramova stated that Udmurtia has the largest concentration of drone manufacturers.[80]\n\n**Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\n\n> Ukrainian partisans and residents in occupied territories continue to provide Ukrainian officials with targeting information.

In the 2nd and 5th, according to the state, there were 350 fighters each. Without rear structures and headquarters - 270-280 real combatants. There are about a hundred people in the \"Carpathians\" group. Conoco was defended by several small groups of Kurds, 8-10 people in each. The 2nd and 5th were supposed to block them. The \u201cCarpathians\u201d had to pass under crossfire and go to the rear of the Kurds, encircling them. The detachment did not have 5-10 minutes to start the attack. The distance to the enemy was from 1000 to 1500 meters.\n\nThe Kurds knew the Wagnerites very well, since a year earlier they had fought with them against the ISIS. They sent negotiators, but the Wagner leadership did not want to talk to them. The massacre took place at night, for 40 minutes. The column of the 5th company was attacked by the Americans on the march: 2 planes, 2 Apache helicopters and 4 drones. The 5th had 3 tanks (1 - T-55, 1 - T-64 and 1 - T-72). T-72 was destroyed (apparently the engines were turned on). In particular, Magnitogorsk Cossack Igor Leonov died in it . The remaining two tanks survived and were not even damaged. Everything around was burning, but they remained intact. During the battle, the commander of the armored group was wounded. His legs were broken, and he loudly called for help. Everything around was exploding and burning, including a Kamaz truck with ammunition, which was located 5 meters from the damaged tank. Despite the threat to life, the Cossacks carried the armored group commander out of the fire without harming themselves. God preserved the brave.\n\nDuring the 40 minutes of the massacre, in the 5th detachment out of 280 soldiers - 39 people died and 122 people were wounded . The people rushed wherever they could, they didn\u2019t even have time to shoot at the Pindos (Americans). The detachment was in the village of Hisham, and many were hiding in houses. By morning, they collected the dead, loaded them onto the remaining transport, the survivors sat on the armor of the remaining tanks and were evacuated. I don\u2019t know the losses in the 2nd and \u201cCarpathians\u201d, but they are less . The next day, the evacuation group discovered the Apache helicopter and fired several machine-gun fires at it. The American helicopter turned around and fired missiles at the group of our fighters, killing 8 people. The bodies of the dead were collected in parts.\n\nThere is little left of Igor Leonov, who burned in the tank. He was buried in Magnitogorsk in a closed coffin. The date of death is stated later.",
