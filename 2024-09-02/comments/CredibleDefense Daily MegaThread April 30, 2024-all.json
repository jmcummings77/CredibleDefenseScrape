As soon as the would-be assassins could confirm that Pannun, a U.S. citizen, was home, \u201cit will be a go ahead from us.\u201d\n\n>Yadav\u2019s identity and affiliation, which have not previously been reported, provide the most explicit evidence to date that the assassination plan \u2014 ultimately thwarted by U.S. authorities \u2014 was directed from within the Indian spy service. Higher-ranking RAW officials have also been implicated, according to current and former Western security officials, as part of a sprawling investigation by the CIA, FBI and other agencies that has mapped potential links to Modi\u2019s inner circle.\n\n> In reports that have been closely held within the American government, U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the RAW chief at the time, Samant Goel. That finding is consistent with accounts provided to The Washington Post by former senior Indian security officials who had knowledge of the operation and said Goel was under extreme pressure to eliminate the alleged threat of Sikh extremists overseas. U.S. spy agencies have more tentatively assessed that Modi\u2019s national security adviser, Ajit Doval, was probably aware of RAW\u2019s plans to kill Sikh activists, but officials emphasized that no smoking gun proof has emerged.\n\n> After the plot against Pannun failed, the decision to entrust Yadav with the high-risk mission sparked recriminations within the agency, former officials said. Rather than joining RAW as a junior officer, Yadav had been brought in midcareer from India\u2019s less prestigious Central Reserve Police Force, said one former official. As a result, the official said, Yadav lacked training and skills needed for an operation that meant going up against sophisticated U.S. counterintelligence capabilities.\n\n> Though Yadav served as RAW\u2019s point man, current and former officials said the operation involved higher-ranking officials with ties to Modi\u2019s inner circle. Among those suspected of involvement or awareness are Goel and Doval, though U.S. officials said there is no direct evidence so far of their complicity.\n\n>As RAW chief at the time, Goel was \u201cunder pressure\u201d to neutralize the alleged threat posed by Sikh extremists overseas, said a former Indian security official. Goel reported to Doval, and had ties to the hard-line national security adviser going back decades.\n\n> Former Indian officials who know both men said Goel would not have proceeded with assassination plots in North America without the approval of his superior and protector.\n\n>\u201cWe always had to go to the NSA for clearance for any operations,\u201d said A.S. Dulat, who served as RAW chief in the early 2000s, referring to the national security adviser. Dulat emphasized in an interview with The Post that he did not have inside knowledge of the alleged operations, and that assassinations were not part of RAW\u2019s repertoire during his tenure.\n\n>U.S. intelligence agencies have reached a similar conclusion.

I can point you to a widespread and noticeable pattern with countless examples that involves every level of the Indian state. It is not merely negligence, but effectively state sponsored religious persecution.\n\nYes, I disagree that it \"has become widespread\" recently. Religious intolerance, persecution of _local_ minorities (be it Hindus, Muslims, or anyone else) has always been a feature of India. If anything, things have improved in recent years.\n\nNote that the \"local minorities\" bit is very important. There isn't an aggregate picture you can draw about Muslims only being persecuted. Because I can also point to a \"widespread and noticeable pattern\" of attacks on other communities _by_ minority groups as well. \n\n> 2) Do you think I am out of line to say that the Indian Court system is no longer independent, that effectively the ruling party has control over it?\n\nYes, absolutely. \n\n> 3)Do you think I am wrong to say that political corruption in India is so rife as to be normalized? There are enough examples of corruption quite out in the open that I am wondering what you could find unusual about this.\n\nPolitical corruption is India is quite rife, yes. Do you think it is a function of state capacity (or the lack of it?) Do you believe it impacts foreign relations? If so, why?\n\n> 4)Are you going to argue that India has not been assassinating citizens of Western nations? Will you argue that friendly nations, or that allies ever do this?\n\nI agree that India has assassinated the citizen of a Western nation. I'll also humbly state that allies often do this. Heck, the US government assassinated its own citizen (and killed some of his family too) abroad.  Without the benefit of a trial in a court of law.\n\n> Can you explain to me how expecting India not to assassinate our citizens is \"Western diktat\" as you so eloquently put it?\n\nExpecting India to not assassinate a US citizen isn't a diktat. Expecting India to revise its domestic politics, governance structure, and approach to law-and-order to please Western notions of right and wrong is absolutely a diktat, and issuing such diktats won't get you anywhere.\n\n> 5) Will you disagree with me when I state that in India, political persecution of opponents of the ruling power is quite extensive, that there is widespread evidence that the ruling party jails opponents, confiscates funds, that they have people murdered, etc. and so on. Do you need me to list examples, or do you just think that this is normal in a Democracy, or perhaps that it is a \"blip on the radar\"?\n\nYes, I will disagree that \"political persecution of opponents of the ruling power is quite extensive.\" Of course, you could cherry-pick a handful of individual instances of what appears to be overreach and conclude that it presents an aggregate picture; but I'll humbly submit that that such views of India's politics that are the product of reading publications like WaPo, NYT, The Guardian, etc., whose coverage of your own domestic issues is drawing heavy criticism. \n___________________\n\nNow, your blunt questions beg blunt questions of my own.\n\n1) Do you agree that the United States' record of toppling governments whose actions do not align with US interests has been _extremely_ problematic? Guatemala, Iraq, Iran, Grenada, Libya etc. come immediately to mind.  What sort of message is sent when a US Secretary of State openly says that the death of 50,000 Iraqi children would be \"worth it\", or another cheered the brutal torture of Libya's leader with a nonchalant \"We came, we saw, he died, hahaha\"?  Would you find it odd if Indians were concerned that the US will attempt a similar regime change operation in India? \n\n2) Further, do you agree that the US also has an excellent record of enabling brutal military/theocratic dictatorships worldwide, often to the detriment of democracies whose values the US claims to live by? For example, the US has strengthened Pinochet, the Saudi regime, Yahya Khan's regime (even using the US military to threaten India as it attempted to stop the genocide in Bangladesh), Saddam Hussein, and so on and so forth. In recent times, it has tried to undermine Bangladesh's democracy by weakening the relatively liberal ruling party and attempting to bring hardline islamists to power.\n\n3) Next, what do you have to say of the US' record of kidnapping people it sees as terrorists from friendly countries and holding them for several years, without trial, at a military base that has been leased from an autocratic regime? I believe it was called \"extraordinary rendition\". \n\n4) Do you agree the US ruling establishment is currently attempting to suppress a presidential candidate by trying to ban him from contesting, tying him up in legal cases, etc.? Is it also correct that said candidate believes that the last election was \"stolen\" from him, and has a large number of supporters who feel the same? Do you suggest that this is a sign of a healthy democracy?\n\n5) Do you see India's concerns about Canada housing terrorists and violent separatists as illegitimate? Do you disagree that these separatists have already carried out the worst terrorist attack in Canadian history, and that Canada totally botched up the investigation? Moreover, would you agree that for the Canadian Prime Minister to attend a rally by such groups where separatist slogans are raised is quite improper? If India were to respond harshly to what it sees as political support for violent separatism in India after exhausting diplomatic options; how is it different from the US carrying out drone strikes in the Middle East?\n\nLastly, understanding how poorly the US and Western nations have lived up to their own professed ideals (I suppose I do not have to bring up a long history of colonialism or the genocide of indigenous peoples in addition to the other points I raised), do you agree that complaining about flaws in India's governance/politics/foreign policy comes across as sanctimonious and hypocritical? Just like you feel that you are \"completely right to not want it aligning with a regime like that\", several Indians feel that aligning with the West is wrong, not just from a moral standpoint, but from a pragmatic one as well. They see the absence of sanctimony from the likes of Russia and China as an important distinction, while differences over border issues can be managed. I feel that they are as short-sighted as their Western counterparts, but I'm also starting to find my appeals for a more sensible, realistic worldview now fall on deaf ears. After all, incendiary rhetoric is simple and catchy. Spreads quicker.",

        "body": "Andrew Perpetua did a Battlefield update on the [Tochnyi Weekly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZsS1T1o4Yo) last Sunday. Here is a summary:\n\n* Ukraine is experiencing a self-imposed crisis due to a shortage of frontline troops and defensive lines. This issue is not caused by a lack of infantry, but rather by the failure to rotate soldiers who have been fighting continuously for two years without any breaks. Many of these soldiers are older, in their 40s, which is particularly problematic in the center of Donbas where Russia is intensifying its attacks.\n* Ukraine failed to construct additional defensive lines, which may result in significant territorial losses. The key question is how much ground Ukraine will need to cede before reaching solid defensive positions. Currently, Ukraine is building defensive lines 10 to 20 km from the frontline. This strategy is very unlikely to result in a domino effect reaching all the way to the Dnipro River.\n* We are likely to witness one of the largest battles of this war soon.\n* In the past, Russia did not \"run out of steam,\" but rather lacked \"motivation.\" This time, however, they are unlikely to face the same issue, as they have pushed Ukraine into a difficult position.\n* He does not anticipate a complete Ukrainian collapse. It could occur if Ukraine refuses to concede ground. However, Ukraine has so far made strategic withdrawals from certain areas, which is a positive sign. He hopes they will continue to retreat until they reach solid defensive lines.\n* There is still a significant shortage of all types of ammunition, especially GMLRS.\n* Russia is amassing large reserves of armored vehicles along the front. This is why Ukraine is urgently requesting more GMLRS, as there are numerous staging areas they could target.\n* Ukraine is adopting tactics that focus on mobility kills for vehicles.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Andrew Perpetua did a Battlefield update on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZsS1T1o4Yo\">Tochnyi Weekly</a> last Sunday. Here is a summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ukraine is experiencing a self-imposed crisis due to a shortage of frontline troops and defensive lines. This issue is not caused by a lack of infantry, but rather by the failure to rotate soldiers who have been fighting continuously for two years without any breaks. Many of these soldiers are older, in their 40s, which is particularly problematic in the center of Donbas where Russia is intensifying its attacks.</li>\n<li>Ukraine failed to construct additional defensive lines, which may result in significant territorial losses. The key question is how much ground Ukraine will need to cede before reaching solid defensive positions. Currently, Ukraine is building defensive lines 10 to 20 km from the frontline. This strategy is very unlikely to result in a domino effect reaching all the way to the Dnipro River.</li>\n<li>We are likely to witness one of the largest battles of this war soon.</li>\n<li>In the past, Russia did not &quot;run out of steam,&quot; but rather lacked &quot;motivation.&quot; This time, however, they are unlikely to face the same issue, as they have pushed Ukraine into a difficult position.</li>\n<li>He does not anticipate a complete Ukrainian collapse. It could occur if Ukraine refuses to concede ground. However, Ukraine has so far made strategic withdrawals from certain areas, which is a positive sign. He hopes they will continue to retreat until they reach solid defensive lines.</li>\n<li>There is still a significant shortage of all types of ammunition, especially GMLRS.</li>\n<li>Russia is amassing large reserves of armored vehicles along the front. This is why Ukraine is urgently requesting more GMLRS, as there are numerous staging areas they could target.</li>\n<li>Ukraine is adopting tactics that focus on mobility kills for vehicles. They are deploying anti-tank mines from drones ahead of advancing tanks, which is proving to be a more reliable method than using FPV drones. He believes that using drones to drop bombs and mines will become the standard approach moving forward, as FPV drones are declining in favor and are increasingly used only where they are most effective.</li>\n<li>FPV drones are better suited for targeting armored positions, infantry, and bunkers. They are gradually becoming a secondary weapon - not because they are ineffective, but because they will be utilized where they excel.</li>\n<li>He is seeking additional volunteers to help document the war in Ukraine: <a href=\"https://tochnyi.info/join-andrew-perpetuas-project-help-document-the-war-in-ukraine/\">Join Andrew Perpetua\u2019s Project to Help Document the War in Ukraine</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

Very interesting reports of what NATO aircraft and drones were doing before and during the strikes.\n\n[ANALYSIS: Reported ATACMS Missile Wave Hits Crimea, Russian Air Defenses and Airfields Pounded | Kyiv Post | April 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/analysis/31903)\n\n*News platforms said it was the long-range version of the US weapon but there was no early Kyiv confirmation. It may have been Ukraine\u2019s most ambitious ballistic missile strike of the war so far.*\n\n*A wave of Ukrainian long-range weapons widely reported to be around a dozen US-made ATACMS ballistic missiles pounded air bases and air defense installations across Crimea peninsula early Tuesday morning, in one of the beefiest Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) long-range attacks yet against the Kremlin-occupied territory.*\n\n*Flights of unidentified weapons first started slamming into military installations across Crimea around 2 a.m., with explosions and air raid warnings widely reported near the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol, and the towns of Gvardeyska, Evpatoria and Dzhankoi, news reports said.*\n\n*Four of those targets, the exception being Dzhankoi, were well outside the range of all weapons the AFU had been known to operate in the past, save recently delivered long-range versions of the US-made ATACMS missile. Estimates of total missile counts used in the attacks ranged from 10-15 weapons, some carrying cluster munitions.*\n\n*Isolated reports said shorter-range ATACMS struck targets nearer territory controlled by Kyiv\u2019s forces, and that Ukrainian strike planners had launched attack drones along with the American missiles.*\n\n*Ukrainian Air Force spokespersons had not responded to a Kyiv Post request for details about the strikes and type of weapon or weapons used in the Tuesday attacks, by the time this article was published.*\n\n*Colonel Roman Svitun, a retired AFU officer and military analyst, told the Kyiv24 television news channel in a Tuesday interview that the early morning strikes are probably part of a Kyiv strategy to degrade Russian air defenses in Crimea and in the south Ukrainian mainland, with the long-term objective of opening the way for destructive missile and drone attacks against other military targets.*\n\n*The Ukrainian strikes overnight were most likely follow-up attacks to ATACMS fired at Russian air defense installations near the mainland cities Genichesk and Mariupol earlier in the month, Svitun said. \u201cIt certainly could have been ATACMS,\u201d he said of the Tuesday strikes. \u201cThey have the capacity to hit anywhere.\u201d*\n\n*Official Russian sources confirmed the fact of multiple attacks by Ukrainian ballistic missiles, and some claimed all incoming weapons were shot down. Sergei Aksenov, the Kremlin-appointed head of the Crimea occupation administration, said of an attack near Simferopol that \u201cafter the ATACMS missiles were shot down they scattered cluster munitions,\u201d and warned residents not to touch them.*\n\n*The pro-Moscow military information platform Dva Mayora said ATACMS missiles were directed at targets near the Crimean cities Simferopol and Dzhankoi and \u201caccording to information coming in, our (Russian) defenders did an outstanding job.\u201d*\n\n*In the hours following the strikes, the heavy weight of traffic from social media in targeted towns and cities contradicted the Kremlin spin of successful intercepts and no damage to targets, reporting hits to anti-aircraft systems, Russian aircraft, command and control center, and military casualties. Accounts of cluster munitions successfully deployed and scattered over targets were common.*\n\n*In Dzhankoi, the Ukrainsky Krym Telegram platform reported, a military airfield was hit with at least two weapons, killing and wounding service personnel assigned to the 4th Command Center of Air Defense Forces of the Russian Air Force, and damaging helicopters assigned to the unit.*\n\n*The independent Russian news agency ASTRA reported a probable ATACMS hitting the Dzhankoi base wounded five service personnel, lit fires burning for at least 90 minutes and confirmed damage to the air defense control center. The weapons used in that strike were MGM-140 ATACMS missiles, the report said.*\n\n**Multiple NATO air reconnaissance aircraft sweeps through airspace above the western Black Sea, including the first-time deployment of a US Navy MQ-4C Triton spy drone, took place in hours before the strikes. NATO and US officials have stated such flights collect general intelligence that is turned over to Kyiv, but not data on specific target locations.**\n\n**One US maritime and signal intelligence platform, a US Navy Boeing P-8APoseidon turboprop four-engine was in the air patrolling above Romania\u2019s south-eastern Danube delta at the time some of the Ukrainian weapons struck Crimean targets some 200 kilometers (124 miles) distant, the pro-Ukraine military news channel Krymsky Veter reported. Kyiv Post checks of open-source flight tracking data confirmed the claim.**\n\n**The Pentagon has deployed Poseidon aircraft in daytime patrols to the area practically every day for more than a year. Poseidon sorties at night over the Danube Delta, such as the one taking place April 29-30, are practically unheard of, Kyiv Post research of air traffic data confirmed.**\n\n*The AFU had prior to the Tuesday morning strikes seemed to launch ATACMS missiles sparingly, according to military sources, because of limited reserves. Were the April 30 strike to be confirmed as having been performed by ATACMS, it would be the most massive single ballistic missile strike carried out by Ukraine since Russia\u2019s Feb. 2022 invasion.*\n\n In the past, according to battle and news reports, the Ukrainians had launched a maximum two ATACMS at a time.*\n\n*Some Beltway analysts have said US Congressional approval of military aid to Ukraine in 2024 has put as many as 100 more ATACMS into the Ukraine arms pipeline.*    \n\n*The last confirmed ATACMS employment by the AFU took place on April 25, and prior to that on April 17 with individual or twin missile launches against Russian air defense systems. The earlier of the two strikes struck an air base near Dzhankoi, according to Ukrainian air force spokesmen destroying or critically damaging four S-400 air defense launchers, three radar stations, an air defense equipment control point, and a Murom-M airspace surveillance system, a Ukraine military intelligence spokesperson told Kyiv Post.*",

I mean, sure, you could test what would happen if GPS straight up ceases to exist. But you can't test any conceivable way in which a GPS signal could potentially be spoofed.

They aren't \"allowed\" to do anything. They've done something because they can, and you can't stop them.\n\nIt's cute that you think the most powerful military in the world *can't* stop a 5th rate military in a 7th rate country.\n\nThis is indeed what happened due to the GWOT, people forgot the capabilities of America, because they have stopped wanting to use them .\n\nYou want a plan? Here is a starter: Blockade Yemen. That's exactly Tit-for-Tat what they're doing to the Suez canal, except you do it pretty much 100%, no more ballistic missiles for the Houthis.\n\nBut nobody has the stomach to do that, they'd rather suffer the hit to international shipping than watch the pictures of the starving children. But don't think for a second that means they *can't,* and the Houthi's *can't* be stopped.\n\nIt's a *won't,* not a *can't.*\n\nSo long as the damage the Houthis achieve is relatively minor and only economical, this is going to continue. However, if at some point they may start suffering from success, shall we say. Indeed if they can consistently repeat this attack which occurred 400km Southeast of the horn of Africa in the Indian ocean, that would mean messing up international shipping to a huge degree, much more than simply hitting ships transiting Suez canal.\n\nI fear/welcome the Houthis are in for a bad time.",

They&#39;ve done something because they can, and you can&#39;t stop them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s cute that you think the most powerful military in the world <em>can&#39;t</em> stop a 5th rate military in a 7th rate country.</p>\n\n<p>This is indeed what happened due to the GWOT, people forgot the capabilities of America, because they have stopped wanting to use them .</p>\n\n<p>You want a plan? Here is a starter: Blockade Yemen. That&#39;s exactly Tit-for-Tat what they&#39;re doing to the Suez canal, except you do it pretty much 100%, no more ballistic missiles for the Houthis.</p>\n\n<p>But nobody has the stomach to do that, they&#39;d rather suffer the hit to international shipping than watch the pictures of the starving children. But don&#39;t think for a second that means they <em>can&#39;t,</em> and the Houthi&#39;s <em>can&#39;t</em> be stopped.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a <em>won&#39;t,</em> not a <em>can&#39;t.</em></p>\n\n<p>So long as the damage the Houthis achieve is relatively minor and only economical, this is going to continue. However, if at some point they may start suffering from success, shall we say. Indeed if they can consistently repeat this attack which occurred 400km Southeast of the horn of Africa in the Indian ocean, that would mean messing up international shipping to a huge degree, much more than simply hitting ships transiting Suez canal.</p>\n\n<p>I fear/welcome the Houthis are in for a bad time.</p>\n</div>",

And it's not the first time that it is alleged that \"outside agitators\"  (as Southern pro-segregation governors would say) are behind student protests. Same claims were made against anti-Vietnam student protests too. These claims are false then as they are now. The root of these student protests is the Gaza war. \n\nThe fact is this is joint US-Israel war on Palestinians (and has been for decades). Every 155 mm artillery shell, every 120 mm tank round and every areal bomb dropped by Israel along with the platforms to deliver them is provided by the US. On top of that, since Gaza war started the US has been feverishly ferrying weapons and ammunition to Israel round the clock. The result of all of this is Israel war on Gaza with few parallels in modern history marked by near total destruction, unparalleled civilian casualties and mass starvation. In fact, you'd have to go back to probably WW2 to find similar levels devastation. According to the UN and the IMF, more than 50% of the buildings in Gaza are either destroyed and/or damaged. In some places like in northern Gaza, more than 70% of the buildings are damaged/destroyed. Then you have tens of thousands of civilians slaughtered by Israel's disproportionate and indiscriminate response to HMS Oct. 7 attacks. So students are aghast and are impelled to protest not only to the one of the most barbaric military campaigns in modern history but one in which their government is intimately involved. I haven't even touched on the blanket economic and diplomatic support the US provides to the Netanyahu regime. Sometimes the explanation for a phenomenon is self-evident and right in front of you - no need to indulge in conspiracy theories about nefarious foreign influence.",
