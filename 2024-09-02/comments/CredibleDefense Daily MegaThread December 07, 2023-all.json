The rest were forced on to a truck for a roughly 30 minute ride into Gaza.\n\nAnucha's first person account offers a glimpse into what many hostages endured - and some continue to endure. He described sleeping on a sandy floor and beatings by Hamas captors, who he said singled out Israelis for especially brutal treatment.\n\nTo keep their hopes up, the four Thai men relied on chess games on a makeshift board, memories of family and craving for Thai food.\n\nFew of the freed hostages have spoken at length about their ordeal, though others who have since been released also described beatings and death threats.\n\nHamas officials did not immediately respond to a written request for comment on Anucha's account.\n\n\"I thought I would die,\" he said on Wednesday, at his family home in rural northeastern Thailand, where he returned this month after 50 days in captivity.\n\nAlmost all that time was spent inside two small underground rooms, secured by armed guards and accessed by dark narrow tunnels.\n\nAt least 240 people - Israelis and foreign nationals - were abducted to Gaza on Oct 7. by Hamas militants who burst through the border and killed some 1,200 people.\n\nMore than 100 hostages - largely women, children and non-Israelis - have been released.\n\nIn retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack, Israel mounted a devastating bombing campaign and ground offensive that has killed more than 15,000 people, according to figures from Palestinian health officials deemed reliable by the United Nations.\n\nSome 130 people, including eight Thais, remain captive.\n\nBefore the war, around 30,000 Thai labourers worked in the agriculture sector, making them one of Israel's largest migrant worker groups. Israel offers the farmhands higher wages.\n\nThailand, which has friendly ties with Israel, recognised Palestine as a sovereign state in 2012.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry has compared the dead Thai hostages to \"heroes\" and said the released captives would receive the same benefits as their Israeli counterparts.\n\nTWO MEALS, TWO BOTTLES OF WATER\n\nOnce in Gaza, the uniformed militants handed the Thais to a small group of men who took them to an abandoned house and tied their hands behind their backs.\n\nThe Thais were joined by a terrified 18-year-old Israeli, a man Anucha said he knew from Kibbutz Re'im, where he worked on an avocado farm.\n\nBeatings began shortly after, as their captors punched and kicked them. \"We shouted 'Thailand, Thailand',\" he said, which eased the intensity of the blows. The young Israeli wasn't spared.\n\nAn hour later, all five were put into another truck that drove for about 30 minutes to a small building that led into a tunnel.\n\nNear the mouth of the tunnel, they were beaten again and photographed, Anucha said, before walking through a dark, roughly meter-wide passage to a small room.\n\n\nIn this windowless space, which measured around 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters and was lit by a bulb, the five were joined by another Israeli man.\n\nThe militants continued kicking and punching the captives for two days, Anucha said. After that, they persisted with another two days of beatings for the Israelis, who were whipped using electrical wires.\n\nAnucha was not seriously injured but weeks after his release from captivity, his wrist still bore marks from the restraints.\n\nThe captives slept on the bare sandy floor. The six men were served flat bread twice a day and shared two bottles of water between them that was replenished daily.\n\nTheir toilet was a hole in the ground near the room, where they were taken by one of eight guards armed with assault weapons that resembled AK-47s. Guards told them not to talk among themselves.\n\n\"I felt hopeless,\" Anucha said.\n\nAnucha initially counted down the days by the number of meals. After four days, the six were marched to another room.\n\nDuring the walk, Anucha said the tunnel, which was lit by flash lights carried by their captors, was lined with metal doors.\n'THAILAND, GO HOME'\n\nTheir new room was more spacious. They had plastic sheets to sleep on. Three bulbs lit the space. An alcove served as their toilet.\n\nThe beatings stopped. The food improved to include nuts, butter and, later, rice.\n\nStill using meals to measure time, Anucha left scratches on the floor to mark the number of days in captivity.\n\nThat changed when a guard brought in some papers for them to sign. He, like the other guards, only spoke Arabic. The Israelis interpreted for Anucha, who said he speaks rudimentary Hebrew.\n\nBut the guard left behind a white ballpoint pen. They used it to mark time, draw tattoos and sketch a chessboard on the plastic sheet. Chess pieces were crafted out of a pink-and-green toothpaste box.\n\nAnother distraction was talk of food. Anucha craved soi ju, a Thai delicacy of pieces of raw beef dipped in spicy sauce, that he dreamt and spoke of.\n\n\"Food was a source of hope,\" he said, smiling.\n\nWeeks passed. Anucha had no inkling of the Israeli raids and bombings aboveground. He often thought of home, his father, his seven year old daughter and his partner of 14 years.\n\nOn Day 35, a man dressed in black arrived for a brief inspection. From his demeanour and the respectful behaviour of the guards, the captives surmised he was a senior Hamas leader.\n\nTheir routine resumed, until one day, a guard arrived following their first meal and announced: \"Thailand, go home.\"\n\nThe four Thais were led through tunnels for roughly two hours and arrived overground to a Hamas facility, where a handful of female Israeli hostages were also waiting.\n\nSome 11 hours later, they were handed over to the Red Cross, which drove them out of Gaza on Nov. 25.\n\n\"I didn't think I would get released,\" he said, \"It was like I was reborn.\"\n\nBut the hardest part was still what he saw on Oct. 7, Anucha said. \"I lost my friend in front of my eyes.\"",

China is in a rough place economically and increasingly diplomatically, closer ties with Russia in the midst of the war in Ukraine is damaging to Chinese relations with Europe, which are critical if China wants to keep its economy afloat in the coming years. The reality is that Europe is far more important to China than Russia as a junior partner in an alliance. \n\n>For Russia, this partnership is helpful in the short term and awful in the long term.\n\nIt's interesting how many people seem to think Russia will come out of this war stronger and more respected. Even if Russia manages to eventually eke out some territorial concessions from Ukraine (which is still far from certain nearly 2 years in), it will be a much weaker country than it was before the war: more internationally isolated, more autarkic, more social issues, weaker economy (more reliant on fossil fuels than ever despite a global transition away from them), and more reliant on China. \n\nHad Putin's original plan succeeded, the war really would've been a major coup that cemented Russian influence and power globally.

US debt continues to be bought, so there is confidence in posting it back. \n\n>Is a scenario of us funding near max wartime production going to be possible in the medium term future?\n\nAbsolutely. The issue currently is that the US doesn't tax enough to cover its spending. Compare pre-1982 taxation levels to current ones, and you'll see there is a lot of room to generate more revenue.

Which I believe is problematic, because EW is dictating heavily how both sides fight.\n\nOn a tangent, I just want to show what a decision made to avoid friendly disruption can mean.  RUSI's report of the UAF Counteroffensive said this about smoke obscuration:\n\n>Only 3% of Ukrainian artillery-fire missions are smoke missions. As demonstrated during the assault on the company position north of Rivnopil, smoke can be extremely useful in confusing the enemy ground force and obscuring assault actions. But smoke also has the effect of obscuring the view from UAVs which higher Ukrainian echelons and command posts use to coordinate activity and conduct combat management. Commanders persistently prioritise maintaining their own understanding of the battlefield over laying down smoke and concealing their personnel\u2019s movements.\n\nTo put that in perspective, when conducting the combined arms breach, despite the obstacles being within direct observation of Russian defenders, the UAF commanders chose not to obscure the approach, points of breach, the attack points, or the enemy positions either because such would also interfere with their ability to use drones for C3 and Recon Fires Complex, despite blinding the enemy.\n\nIf they truly cranked up EW, they'd do even more damage to their present tactics, techniques, and procedures.\n\nRussia too, their military version drones are a little bit more hardened against EW jamming than the typical UAF ones that are mostly commercial, but AFAIK their tactical forces under the battalion HQ level especially barely have access to digital radios that would allow them to use encrypted freq hopping. Even early in the war, before they saw massive attrition, a significant number of their tanks and IFV didn't have the newer Azart radios; after attrition, even fewer would have them.\n\nI've read plenty of reports that the Russians are reliant on Baofeng ICOM radios for most of their tactical communications. That's the crap anyone can buy on Amazon or Aliexpress for $30 apiece, easily jammed with WW1 level technology. Even if other units have Azart radios, they can't use them widely, mass communication requires all tactical units using similar systems so they can speak to one another, so there is a good chance the Russian digital radios also often are talking in the clear, on unsecure, un-encypted frequencies.\n\nWhich means if the Russians cranked up their own EW during their attacks trying to jam the UAF, their own troops would lose radio communications, not to mention degrading a lot of their own drones too. So they can't use EW for that role during the attacks, at least only during short specific windows decided during the planning process where they accept temporary degradation in comms (if they even bother).\n\nAnd, AFAIK, the Ukrainians aren't much better. Early in the war, the US govt flooded the UAF with our older SINCGARS radios, which are digital with freq hopping abilities, but not in the numbers sufficient for mass equipping down to the platoon level. From what I read earlier in the war, it was enough so at least every battalion could communicate securely with higher headquarters. While I'm not deliberately searching for evidence, when I do see videos or pictures of UAF troops with or using ICOM radios, I retty much only see Baofeng or other types, the occasional Motorola, which doesn't allow for freq hopping, so easily jammed.\n\nAlso, I've seen no evidence we provided them with the equipment and necessary training to effectively use them either. Using digital radios is tough, they require a high quality communications office in every battalion level at least, who are weekly updating COMSEC and frequencies, with with all combat troops using the radios also fully knowledgeable in user level requirements, which would include knowing how to load the fills given to them by their trained unit's commo people. Speaking as a former US Army infantry squad leader who had half a dozen digital radios hand-receipted to myself, along with lots of other commo equipment, that stuff was ridiculously hard to use during tactical operations, the US Army struggles to make our complicated commo system work in wartime situations. I doubt heavily the barely trained Ukrainians or Russians can pull it off.\n\nWhen it comes to drones, I know far less about them. But from what I've heard, most of them are as easy to jam as tactical radios. And if so, both sides in the Russo-Ukraine War are going to be seriously degrading themselves if they try to jam their opponents on a wider scale.\n\nLikely not the same issue Western militaries will face, who have mass-issued and standardized digital radios since the mid 1990s, and who in the mid 2010s made a concerted effort to only use drones that are specifically hardened against EW.",

Commanders persistently prioritise maintaining their own understanding of the battlefield over laying down smoke and concealing their personnel\u2019s movements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To put that in perspective, when conducting the combined arms breach, despite the obstacles being within direct observation of Russian defenders, the UAF commanders chose not to obscure the approach, points of breach, the attack points, or the enemy positions either because such would also interfere with their ability to use drones for C3 and Recon Fires Complex, despite blinding the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>If they truly cranked up EW, they&#39;d do even more damage to their present tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p>\n\n<p>Russia too, their military version drones are a little bit more hardened against EW jamming than the typical UAF ones that are mostly commercial, but AFAIK their tactical forces under the battalion HQ level especially barely have access to digital radios that would allow them to use encrypted freq hopping. Even early in the war, before they saw massive attrition, a significant number of their tanks and IFV didn&#39;t have the newer Azart radios; after attrition, even fewer would have them.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve read plenty of reports that the Russians are reliant on Baofeng ICOM radios for most of their tactical communications. That&#39;s the crap anyone can buy on Amazon or Aliexpress for $30 apiece, easily jammed with WW1 level technology. Even if other units have Azart radios, they can&#39;t use them widely, mass communication requires all tactical units using similar systems so they can speak to one another, so there is a good chance the Russian digital radios also often are talking in the clear, on unsecure, un-encypted frequencies.</p>\n\n<p>Which means if the Russians cranked up their own EW during their attacks trying to jam the UAF, their own troops would lose radio communications, not to mention degrading a lot of their own drones too. So they can&#39;t use EW for that role during the attacks, at least only during short specific windows decided during the planning process where they accept temporary degradation in comms (if they even bother).</p>\n\n<p>And, AFAIK, the Ukrainians aren&#39;t much better. Early in the war, the US govt flooded the UAF with our older SINCGARS radios, which are digital with freq hopping abilities, but not in the numbers sufficient for mass equipping down to the platoon level. From what I read earlier in the war, it was enough so at least every battalion could communicate securely with higher headquarters. While I&#39;m not deliberately searching for evidence, when I do see videos or pictures of UAF troops with or using ICOM radios, I retty much only see Baofeng or other types, the occasional Motorola, which doesn&#39;t allow for freq hopping, so easily jammed.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I&#39;ve seen no evidence we provided them with the equipment and necessary training to effectively use them either. Using digital radios is tough, they require a high quality communications office in every battalion level at least, who are weekly updating COMSEC and frequencies, with with all combat troops using the radios also fully knowledgeable in user level requirements, which would include knowing how to load the fills given to them by their trained unit&#39;s commo people. Speaking as a former US Army infantry squad leader who had half a dozen digital radios hand-receipted to myself, along with lots of other commo equipment, that stuff was ridiculously hard to use during tactical operations, the US Army struggles to make our complicated commo system work in wartime situations. I doubt heavily the barely trained Ukrainians or Russians can pull it off.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to drones, I know far less about them. But from what I&#39;ve heard, most of them are as easy to jam as tactical radios. And if so, both sides in the Russo-Ukraine War are going to be seriously degrading themselves if they try to jam their opponents on a wider scale.</p>\n\n<p>Likely not the same issue Western militaries will face, who have mass-issued and standardized digital radios since the mid 1990s, and who in the mid 2010s made a concerted effort to only use drones that are specifically hardened against EW.</p>\n</div>",

This necessitates broad spectrum omnidirectional signal jamming platforms, which are substantially more extensive than directed signal jammers.

Basic DJI\\Autel and similar drones operate on specific standard frequencies, and since they were meant to be compliant to governmental regulations, they were made vulnerable to EW on purpose. The handicaps can be mostly fixed, but the standard frequencies meant that commercial\\military EW contractors built their production lines for the signal jammers to these drones. \n\nHowever FPVs are made using a wide variety of non-standard radio parts (control channel is often in between 840-1300Mhz for example), and there are currently no effective \"military-grade\" jammers available - the R&D and procurement simply can't keep up. And by the time they catch up, FPVs will move to other frequencies (they already do). \n\nMost of anti-FPV jammers have to be of the dome-type - all-round emitters with relatively short range. Currently the main source for all parts is China - they [produce stuff like this](https://m.aliexpress.com/item/1005005657978407.html) en masse. You stack'em up, attach appropriate antennas and power units, and there you have your magic voodoo force field. However currently it is about 20-30% effective against incoming FPVs. Also when its on, it emits like crazy so that enemy electronic surveillance can spot that in a matter of minutes with ~100m accuracy, which may bring unnecessary attention.\n\nOf course it is a bit more complicated than that to explain in a single post - many radio-nerds on both sides of this war are working hard to create a solution that can be effective and scaled up. There is about a dozen honest and significant EW startups in Ukraine that have done some great work on this. I personally (though by no means a radio-nerd myself) assisted at least one of them to start things up. However they all receive exactly zero help and instead lots of hindering from the government. So we can't set up large production like the russians, that have a direct state supervision and mass production. Currently the russians outnumber us ~10:1 in the number of active anti-FPV EW shields (though again with ~30% or worse efficiency), and they also were first to create a more significant and powerful area jammers specifically against FPVs.\n\nBut in this fight, classic EW is doomed to fail sooner or later, since AI-integration is rapidly moving forward and basic targeting assist is already in use. Once its more or less autonomous, I feel sorry for us meatbags.",

And by the time they catch up, FPVs will move to other frequencies (they already do). </p>\n\n<p>Most of anti-FPV jammers have to be of the dome-type - all-round emitters with relatively short range. Currently the main source for all parts is China - they <a href=\"https://m.aliexpress.com/item/1005005657978407.html\">produce stuff like this</a> en masse. You stack&#39;em up, attach appropriate antennas and power units, and there you have your magic voodoo force field. However currently it is about 20-30% effective against incoming FPVs. Also when its on, it emits like crazy so that enemy electronic surveillance can spot that in a matter of minutes with ~100m accuracy, which may bring unnecessary attention.</p>\n\n<p>Of course it is a bit more complicated than that to explain in a single post - many radio-nerds on both sides of this war are working hard to create a solution that can be effective and scaled up. There is about a dozen honest and significant EW startups in Ukraine that have done some great work on this. I personally (though by no means a radio-nerd myself) assisted at least one of them to start things up. However they all receive exactly zero help and instead lots of hindering from the government. So we can&#39;t set up large production like the russians, that have a direct state supervision and mass production. Currently the russians outnumber us ~10:1 in the number of active anti-FPV EW shields (though again with ~30% or worse efficiency), and they also were first to create a more significant and powerful area jammers specifically against FPVs.</p>\n\n<p>But in this fight, classic EW is doomed to fail sooner or later, since AI-integration is rapidly moving forward and basic targeting assist is already in use. Once its more or less autonomous, I feel sorry for us meatbags.</p>\n</div>",

Opening up the northern front only to have to close it again, that&#39;s a political defeat.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m talking about serious territory-grabbing offensives of course.  Harassment is common along many parts of the northern front.</p>\n</div>",

Germany famously sent 5000 helmets on the day of the invasion and not a single thing more for weeks.

You can argue that this is a necessary shake up to a moribund organisation and will inject new blood to a stagnant upper echelon, but to call it a 'battle hardened force' is another far, *far* conclusion. We can see the entrenchment of political appointments like Gerasimov and Shoigu while actual military officers such as Surovikin gets sacked for not delivering results.

[The war isn't doing that issue any favours.](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/23/russians-have-emigrated-in-huge-numbers-since-the-war-in-ukraine) So unless you see Russia actually becoming a gas station for China as a win, then yes, you are right that Russian losses are temporary.\n\nOn an unrelated note:\n\n>...only for the IRGC to come back as the beast it is today with newfound ideas and technology that matched 21st century conflict and which is now transforming the character of warfare in the Middle East with dire consequences for the West.\n\nHow, exactly, is the IRGC a beast and how has it transformed warfare in the middle east? They could barely push out ISIS in Iraq without US-led aviation support and was suffering in Syria for a very long time until the Russians stepped in. If anything, ISIS transformed 21st century warfare by combining snazzy media editing with extreme violence to attract recruits from all over the world, and effective use of commercial drones to deliver deadly payloads. I know you're incredibly biased to Iran but atleast try to arrive to conclusions from a factual and not emotional basis.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran had 2 decades worth of record high commodity prices to build a military that still shakes with fear when Israel is mentioned. Might as well say 'Azerbaijan revolutionised 21st century warfare'.",
