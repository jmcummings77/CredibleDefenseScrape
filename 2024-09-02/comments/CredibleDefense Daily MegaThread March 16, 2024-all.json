The wave of ISIS terror attacks in Europe ended with, if my memory serves me right, a truck ramming attack in Sweden and a French clergyman getting stabbed inside his church, and then ... nothing. The end was quite noticeable for anybody who regularly followed the news.\n\nWhat exactly happened will probably not be publicly accessible for many decades, if ever, but my strong suspicion (which I insist is my just personal hypothesis) is that that's when European counter-terrorism agencies started drag-netting domestic communications, like what the NSA became infamous for doing in the Snowden leaks. We certainly know that sophisticated tools like XKeyscore existed at the time for doing just that. Furthermore, it's also possible that this capability was performed directly by the Americans for the benefit of the European agencies, which would go a long way in explaining the (IMO quite extraordinary) abruptness of the halt in terror attacks across the entire continent - as well as be politically ultra-controversial for obvious reasons. But it was quite clear in 2015 that nobody in Europe had any solution to the lone-wolf terrorist problem, and that the political climate was getting seriously unbearable. That's why I'm personally inclined to believe that European decision-makers would've been ready to waive their data sovereignty in the name of counter-terrorism.\n\nAnd there is little reason why drag-netting wouldn't work. It's rare for terrorists to radicalise in a bubble, impressionable loners typically come into contact with Islamist groups, who then influence them. And that contact typically isn't going to be initiated over something like the Tor browser, but over the regular, open internet.\n\nIf drag-netting is indeed what happened (and again, I have no proof that this is indeed the case), then it shows once again the difficult dilemma between security and privacy. An overbearing security apparatus can be used for both counter-terrorism and illegal spying by well-placed officials, because it's fundamentally hard to control the controller. Even more so if it's all done under the rug, without informing the public, because institutional accountability gets difficult. But at the same time, alerting the public of the methods used by spying agencies means that terrorist networks would also be informed. Hard choices all around.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ah, that&#39;s something I remember very clearly. The wave of ISIS terror attacks in Europe ended with, if my memory serves me right, a truck ramming attack in Sweden and a French clergyman getting stabbed inside his church, and then ... nothing. The end was quite noticeable for anybody who regularly followed the news.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly happened will probably not be publicly accessible for many decades, if ever, but my strong suspicion (which I insist is my just personal hypothesis) is that that&#39;s when European counter-terrorism agencies started drag-netting domestic communications, like what the NSA became infamous for doing in the Snowden leaks. We certainly know that sophisticated tools like XKeyscore existed at the time for doing just that. Furthermore, it&#39;s also possible that this capability was performed directly by the Americans for the benefit of the European agencies, which would go a long way in explaining the (IMO quite extraordinary) abruptness of the halt in terror attacks across the entire continent - as well as be politically ultra-controversial for obvious reasons. But it was quite clear in 2015 that nobody in Europe had any solution to the lone-wolf terrorist problem, and that the political climate was getting seriously unbearable. That&#39;s why I&#39;m personally inclined to believe that European decision-makers would&#39;ve been ready to waive their data sovereignty in the name of counter-terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>And there is little reason why drag-netting wouldn&#39;t work. It&#39;s rare for terrorists to radicalise in a bubble, impressionable loners typically come into contact with Islamist groups, who then influence them. And that contact typically isn&#39;t going to be initiated over something like the Tor browser, but over the regular, open internet.</p>\n\n<p>If drag-netting is indeed what happened (and again, I have no proof that this is indeed the case), then it shows once again the difficult dilemma between security and privacy. An overbearing security apparatus can be used for both counter-terrorism and illegal spying by well-placed officials, because it&#39;s fundamentally hard to control the controller. Even more so if it&#39;s all done under the rug, without informing the public, because institutional accountability gets difficult. But at the same time, alerting the public of the methods used by spying agencies means that terrorist networks would also be informed. Hard choices all around.</p>\n</div>",

It's not about the vote count. As you said, the count is rigged anyway.\n\nThe elections offer an opportunity to generate a media narrative. And once it becomes pervasive in the media, it carries over into organic conversations on the street. And once enough people believe that Putin has broad support, it becomes a sort of self-confirming fact.
