Ukrainian resistance provides extraordinary security benefits to Americans.\nIn fact, Ukraine\u2019s resistance to Russia\u2019s genocidal invasion does more for American security than any American policy does \u2013 or could do. It has changed the global balance in a way that makes peace more likely in decades to come.\n\nRepublicans present China as America\u2019s real, long-term rival. Democrats agree. The scenario for a U.S.-China war is a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. By resisting a Russian invasion, Ukrainians have shown the difficulty of such operations, making this scenario less likely. By fighting in self-defense, Ukrainians have thus reduced the risk of a major war and of a nuclear war. This extraordinary achievement is due to the courage and skill of Ukrainians. They do not get much credit for it. They should get more credit, and more support.\n\nFor decades, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have failed to formulate a policy that could prevent Russia from weakening and undoing the international order. Russia serves as a cat\u2019s paw, doing what China would not wish to be seen doing. \nIn defeating Russia\u2019s armed forces and exposing Russia\u2019s weakness, the Ukrainians have both made a larger war in Europe far less likely, and gotten China\u2019s cat\u2019s paw under control. \n\nThe Ukrainians have reduced the possibility of Chinese aggression through Russia, and made direct Chinese aggression less likely. They have done all of this just by defending themselves, without making any move against China. Without the Ukrainians, the United States would lack the policy instruments for this. By resisting, Ukrainians created an opportunity for U.S. policy that would not otherwise have existed. No American lives have been placed at risk. U.S. assistance to Ukraine amounts to a rounding error in the defense budget. \n\nThe gains Ukrainian resistance brings to American security are so enormous that the US national security establishment is embarrassed to speak of them directly. It is awkward to say that another country is doing so much for us. It is awkward to say that Ukrainian resistance has done more for the safety of Americans than any U.S. policy since the end of the cold war. But it is true and must be said.\n\nReversing the U.S. policy of aiding Ukraine will undo all of these gains. There is still time to revive Russia and reassure China, which is what ending support of Ukraine will mean. Such a policy reversal would make Americans far less safe and secure. My concerns about the Russian invasion of Ukraine are the prevention of genocide and the defense of democracy. But those who think first of U.S. interests should acknowledge what Ukrainians are doing for American security. The least we can do is be on our own side.\u201d",

You need a STANAG 4569 Level 5 to resist 155mm (or similar) shrapnel at 25 meters, human flesh with a half-baked bulletproof vest likely wont survive.

Combat footage sub is full of videos of russians hit by drone dropped hand grenades that are injured/killed even when the grenade explodes some meters away, and some can even run although they're injured, for a while. A 155mm shell (or comparable artillery shells) carry some more punch with them. A grenade like the ones used in the drone videos is like a firecracker compared to a shell, so we can safely assume that the people in this video are not going well at all.\n\nHope this weird conversation can come to an end.",

But in a separate confidential report to senior officials, Liao struck a different tone, alerting Beijing that a mysterious, dangerous disease had surfaced.\n\nHer reports to officials were part of a powerful internal reporting system long used by the ruling Communist Party to learn about issues considered too sensitive for the public to know. Chinese journalists and researchers file secret bulletins to top officials, ensuring they get the information needed to govern, even when it\u2019s censored.\n\nBut this internal system is struggling to give frank assessments as Chinese leader Xi Jinping consolidates his power, making it risky for anyone to directly question the party line even in confidential reports, a dozen Chinese academics, businesspeople and state journalists said in interviews with The Associated Press.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the impact has been, given the secretive nature of high-level Chinese politics. But the risk is ill-informed decision-making with less feedback from below, on everything from China\u2019s stance on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to its approach to the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cPowerful leaders become hostages,\u201d said **Dali Yang**, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. \u201cThey actually are living in cocoons: protected, but also shielded from information that they should be open to.\u201d\n\nThe reports are classified as state secrets, giving them an air of mystery in China. They are called \u201cneican,\u201d which is pronounced \u201cNAY-tsahn\u201d and means \u201cinternal reference.\u201d\n\nThey report on what would be considered staples of journalism in many other countries: corruption, strikes, public criticism, industrial accidents. In China, such matters can be too sensitive for public consumption, as they \u201ccould damage the Party\u2019s reputation,\u201d a 2020 Chinese academic paper says.\n\nNewspapers, think tanks and universities across China each have their own classified reporting channel, sending intelligence up to local and provincial officials. They monitor air pollution in industrial Hebei province and guide the disposal of spoiled pickles in Hunan, a region famed for its cuisine.\n\nBut a few outlets, such as Xinhua and the state-controlled People\u2019s Daily, supply intelligence directly to China\u2019s rulers. Their confidential reports have toppled officials, changed policy, and launched government campaigns against poverty and waste.\n\nThe Communist Party calls internal reporting a secret weapon, acting as its \u201ceyes and ears,\u201d while propaganda acts as its \u201cthroat and tongue.\u201d\n\nThose who write internal reports are thoughtful, open-minded and often critical of the government, says **Maria Repnikova**, a Chinese media expert at Georgia State University.\n\nThey can face threats or intimidation, even when backed by the state, with officials taking extreme measures to block bad news from reaching their superiors.\n\n\u201cThey are quite cautious about what goes in there, because they still have gatekeepers,\u201d Repnikova said.\n\nXi is intimately familiar with the power of this internal reporting system, said Alfred Wu, a former reporter who met Xi when he governed Fujian province. Xi cultivated ties with reporters from Xinhua and the People\u2019s Daily, the outlets with direct, confidential lines of communication to Beijing \u2014 and thus, the power to influence his career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d always mingle and socialize with journalists,\u201d Wu said. \u201cXi\u2019s street smarts helped him so much.\u201d\n\nAfter coming to power in 2012, Xi stifled dissent and launched an anti-corruption campaign that jailed rivals. The crackdown has made reporters more cautious about what they write in internal memos.\n\nXi took control of Xinhua, which nominally reports to the No. 2 official, the premier. Under Xi, Xinhua at times began to ignore Premier Li Keqiang, whose frustrations boiled over in an internal meeting, said Wu and a state media journalist with knowledge of the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject.\n\nDuring a visit to Xinhua, Xi called internal reference reports \u201cvery important,\u201d saying he had paid attention to them throughout his career.\n\nBut a Xinhua journalist famed for internal reports that helped take down a senior executive at a state company is now unable to publish, according to a close associate. Though the internal reference system remains powerful and active, they said, the risks of reporting sensitive information have grown.\n\n\u201cBefore, he could make these disclosures because Xinhua had the power to protect him,\u201d the associate said, declining to be named for fear of retribution. \u201cNow, they say he can\u2019t report these things anymore.\u201d\n\nThe internal reports system was also vulnerable to corruption. Officials and businesspeople manipulated it to lobby for their interests. In one incident, Shanxi province officials gave cash and gold ingots to reporters to cover up a mine accident that killed 38 people.\n\nXi\u2019s crackdown has reined in corruption, but also sidelined many of Xi\u2019s competitors and paralyzed low-level officials, who are reluctant to act without clear permission from the top.",

Even if the piece was censored, he reasoned, it might get the attention of senior officials.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe information bubble is very serious,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure even the authorities have a grasp of how popular a certain view really is.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>More than 100,000 people viewed Hu\u2019s essay online. Within hours, it was blocked.</p>\n</div>",

Analysts say Russia\u2019s performance in Ukraine, coupled with Western sanctions, is likely to hurt its ability to sell weapons abroad. Southeast Asia is a case in point.*\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/06/world/europe/russia-weapons-southeast-asia.html?\n\nArms sales have long been an important part of Russian foreign policy. But those sales were declining before the invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say that the war will probably hasten the trend.\n\nRussia\u2019s performance on the battlefield has damaged its reputation as a military power, they say, and financial and export controls by the U.S. and European governments will make it that much harder for the Kremlin to present itself as a reliable long-term arms supplier for future deals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Russia can recover as a major arms exporter from this,\u201d said **Ian Storey**, a political scientist at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore who studies security issues in Asia. \u201cNot for a long time, if ever.\u201d\n\nRussia is still the world\u2019s second-largest arms exporter after the United States, and its sales of air defense systems and combat aircraft to China and Egypt \u2014 its second- and third-largest clients after India \u2014 have risen substantially in recent years, according to the **Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, known as SIPRI**.\n\nBut from 2017 to 2021, Russia\u2019s share of the global arms export market declined by 5 percent, to 19 percent, compared with the previous four-year period, according to SIPRI data. Its exports also fell by about a quarter, primarily because of decreasing demand from India and Vietnam.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine grinds on and sanctions against Russia increase, doubts are growing about the quality of Russian weapons, as well as Moscow\u2019s capacity to produce advanced weapons and provide long-term support for clients who buy them, said **Siemon Wezeman**, a senior arms researcher at SIPRI.\n\n\u201cRussia just doesn\u2019t have the technology base or the economy to support development of many types of new weapons and components,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysts say that Southeast Asia, where Russia has traditionally been the top arms supplier, is a useful case study in the Kremlin\u2019s declining prospects as an arms exporter.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, South Korea eclipsed Russia as the region\u2019s top arms supplier, providing 18 percent of the region\u2019s arms imports, according to SIPRI data. No other exporter accounted for more than 14 percent.\n\nDuring that period, South Korea sent warships to the Philippines and Thailand, submarines to Indonesia, and combat and trainer aircraft to the Philippines and Thailand. Russia also lost a few potential deals. Indonesia canceled an order for 11 Russian fighter jets last year, buying American and French planes instead.\n\nFor many Southeast Asian nations, the United States is an increasingly attractive arms supplier because it links weapons purchases with military or diplomatic support against China, Mr. Wezeman said. Several European arms suppliers have been willing to help countries in the region develop their own arms industries and capabilities, in some cases through technology transfers, he added.\n\nAnother reason to avoid purchasing Russian arms is to signal a neutral position on the invasion of Ukraine, said John Parachini, a senior defense researcher at the RAND Corporation.\n\n\u201cDespite a likely aggressive Russian effort to market its arms exports in the Southeast Asia, they will find fewer customers,\u201d he said.\n\nOne exception might be Myanmar, where the ruling military junta, saddled with U.S. sanctions that limit its weapons purchases, has signaled a willingness to sign more arms deals with Russia. However, there are questions about whether the Kremlin would have the supplies to manufacture them.\n\nAnother could be Vietnam, Russia\u2019s largest arms client in Southeast Asia. Because that country\u2019s military arsenal has been built around Soviet and Russian weaponry for decades, adding weapons from new suppliers could create compatibility issues, said Ridzwan Rahmat, the principal defense analyst at Janes, based in Singapore.\n\nAt the same time, he added, Vietnam appears to be \u201cslowly shifting its orbit from Russian systems to a mix that includes NATO-compliant ones, although this will take decades.\u201d\n\nEven before the war, Vietnam was trying to diversify its arsenal by manufacturing its own guns and troop carriers and buying small amounts of weapons from India and Israel. The war in Ukraine will likely accelerate that process, and it could even spur Vietnam to buy Western-made weapons on a much faster timeline than it had planned, said Nguyen The Phuong, a scholar of Vietnam\u2019s military at the University of New South Wales in Australia.\n\n\u201cIf we want to maintain some kind of deterrence capability toward China, the modernization has to speed up like 10 times faster,\u201d he said.",

There are a lot of fairly classic imperial misunderstandings that play into this. To recap:\n\n\"Novorossiya\" was a name given by Catherine the Great to the area from Odessa to Crimea to Donetsk/Luhansk to some of Krasnodar/Circassia, freshly conquered from the Crimean Khanate in the early/mid 18th century. Almost all of this area never belonged to the Kyivan Rus', and unlike most of Ukraine it was never ruled by the Poles or the Lithuanians. It didn't have a lot of Slavic inhabitants besides wandering cossacks, until Catherine let Ukrainian peasants settle the countryside. The \"natives\" were mostly Tatars and Greeks (the latter in some coastal cities founded by Byzantines or even ancient Greece). \n\nAs one does, despite the rich history of the region, Catherine framed the takeover as a settlement of \"virgin lands\", and an actualization of the \"true\" Eastern Christian, Greek/Byzantine-originated Russian civilization that \"belongs there\". She erased the memory of the earlier Tatar culture in part by renaming everything in a Greek-sounding way, such as Sevastopol (originally Akhtiar), Simferopol (Aqmescit), etc. and founding new cities that also have Greek-like names (e.g. Odessa, Mariupol). \n\nThen in the 19th century, the area industrialized with the \"Wild East\" giving a fertile ground to industrial barons from England and Germany. Unlike the first wave of rural Ukrainian settlers, the new industrial workers mostly came from Russia and spoke Russian (here is where the \"rural\" part of the Ukrainian stereotype comes from; this Ukr/Ru rural/urban division is still there, by the way). Industrial cities like Donetsk, Kryvyi Rih, and Luhansk sprung up from nothing in this period (that's why they have Russian/Ukrainian names unlike most other cities in the region). At the same time, the cities (even old Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv) were being aggressively Russified as a longer-term policy. This urban/high-brow culture was essentially blind to the countryside being Ukrainian. \n\nAnyhow, the big takeaway in this context is that Catherine's framing of the \"Novorossiya\" story worked pretty well. Russian history books essentially gloss over the complicated parts like the countryside being very Ukrainian, or everything being built on top of the ashes of the Tatars; it's described as Russians taking over a formerly uncivilized/Islamic place and bringing civilization to the area, with the rural Ukrainians only a minor, ethnically stereotyped backdrop to the story. Russians are also generally fairly ignorant of the Ukrainian national identity later heavily superseding the ethnic identity & Catherine's story in the actual area. \n\nA particular misunderstanding that I see even with liberal Russians is the emphasis on Galicia/far west as \"the home of Ukrainian nationalism\", as if it was a historically regional characteristic with no real roots elsewhere. But actually the ideas were broadly popular among Ukrainian peasants across Ukraine, even to the East. Galicia only stands out because it was under Austria-Hungary, where there was no censorship comparable to the Russian empire (outside a few short flashes of press freedom under Alexander II and 1905-1907), so Ukrainian activists *had* to base their operations there. A lot of the famous \"Galician\" Ukrainian nationalists of the 1800s were actually born in the East and were exiled there after they got caught!",

Not Jamaica, not the Dominican Republic, not a single country was able to deal with abject poverty, crippling political instability, and persistent political meddling by a superpower next door by itself, not least after being subject to 200 years of slavery and 150 years of extortion directly before then.</p>\n\n<p>This is a generally accepted understanding of the history and geopolitics of Haiti in the literature. It&#39;s not a pop history understanding in the slightest, unlike the fantasy where countries can fix their problems if their people just want to hard enough.</p>\n</div>",

I remain highly critical of them for five reasons. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. It creates a view of events so one sided Russia is portrayed as barely having any agency, Russia being  presented purely as a reactive actor. Even as a reactive actor those theories treat Russia as quietly suffering indignity after indignity because its such a non actor. \n\n\n2. They do a poor job exploring the relationships between NATO members and Russia. \u201cNATO\u201d evokes the image of a strong anti Russian alliance. Substituting NATO for \u201cFrance, Germany, Italy, etc\u201d creates a different effect. Why you can find comments like this (https://www.politico.eu/article/silvio-berlusconi-italy-defend-vladimir-putin-war-ukraine-russia/) is because there was much more to the relationships between Russia and NATO nations then pure hostility. \n\n3. They struggle to deal with ideology. To be fair that is a problem with commentary on international politics in general. With domestic politics it is acknowledged that ideology is a major motivating factor for why actors like Liz Truss do the things they do. With international politics ideology is at times downplayed or ignored for some vague concept of national interest or rationality. The problem with certain concepts of rationality is they can twisted or expand in ways that make almost anything seem rational. \n\n Domino theory is a great example of how ideology dictated foreign policy. One of the refreshing things about Pro Russian views is they are capable of embracing the full range of ideological reasons for the invasion of Ukraine even if they don't make sense. In West people who stick NATO/US as being mostly responsible for the war only consider the most respectable sounding reasons (the \u201cthere really were Nazis in Ukraine\u201d is an example of that though I still think that is a terrible reason as Nazis can be found worldwide. \n\n4. They struggle to deal with Ukraine. In some theories they are nothing more than the puppet of the US.  I've become more reluctant to label people/nations as puppets because I think it promotes an incorrect and shallow view after reading more history. For example in books like\u201cWhy Intelligence Fails\u201d by by Robert Jervis he notes that while Iranian revolutionaries saw the Shah as a puppet the US saw him as his own man, the situation turning out how it did because each of the three parties (US, Shah, revolutionaries) saw things in a different way. \n\n While Lukashenko has been called a puppet by some others still acknowledge he has some degree of agency. Stripping away all agency from Ukraine leads to comments like \u201cThe US plans to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian\u201d as if there are no other reasons for them to fight and brings up questions like why couldn't the US use their mastery of puppetry in Afghanistan against the Tablian. \n\n The few that give Ukraine agency do so only to add that they also played a part in provoking Russia who is still treated as a purely reactive actor. \n\n5. They often stress how NATO shutting down Ukraine combined with declaration of Ukrainian neutrality could have prevented the war but I think that is questionable. If we're going to accept there are major reasons that had nothing to do with NATO then it was all the better that Russia attacked Ukraine now before they could build up their forces. If we're going to accept NATO was one of the biggest factors Ukrainian neutrality may not be enough because they could still work with NATO nations to undermine Russia underhandedly. \n\n&nbsp;\n \nI think the theories about NATO are important to discuss mainly because how often they come with the idea that the US/Europe should be pressing for negotiations instead of more war. I haven't seen a single work pushing for negotiations consider that the war is part of shaping the negotiations though.",

Official US foreign policy of strategic ambiguity bites both ways. If the Taiwanese aren't sure they're going to be defending Taiwan with the US, then destroying the island and dying for US foreign policy which hasn't always been rock solid isn't worth it.\n\nTaiwan has seen the US flip its relationship with it to cozy up to China during the Cold War, it's had its own secret nuclear weapons program dismantled by the US (which would have guaranteed its own sovereignty), and its seen it's mutual defense treaty with the US shuttered in favor of US offshoring and building up China into the second largest economy in the world.\n\nRight now Taiwanese strategy is trying to win the diplomatic battles by contrasting itself with China and investing in anything that helps its image internationally. This includes buying prestigious equipment from the West. Whether or not the West, or the international community would even help Taiwan was a question mark not too long ago. And gaining that sympathy and the diplomatic relationship from certain arms deals is worth more than the weapons themselves. It doesn't take its security as seriously as the US wants, because it has its own interests that aren't completely aligned with what the US wants. The US is only so serious about defending Taiwan because it can't overcommit itself, and is still terrified of completely alienating and confronting China today via a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. And the US can't give Taiwan a free valuable mutual defense treaty with nothing in return besides an extremely escalatory and confrontational China. So everyone is conducting themselves in a manner that is not straightforward because everyone is anticipating each others actions for escalation.\n\nTaiwan's already won a lot diplomatically this way, and despite everything I've said above, the US has pretty much all but officially stated that they'll defend Taiwan. Which is worth more than anything else they could invest in defense wise. In the lead up to an actual invasion, I don't doubt all sides will make clear their intentions much more explicitly.",

If the Taiwanese aren&#39;t sure they&#39;re going to be defending Taiwan with the US, then destroying the island and dying for US foreign policy which hasn&#39;t always been rock solid isn&#39;t worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan has seen the US flip its relationship with it to cozy up to China during the Cold War, it&#39;s had its own secret nuclear weapons program dismantled by the US (which would have guaranteed its own sovereignty), and its seen it&#39;s mutual defense treaty with the US shuttered in favor of US offshoring and building up China into the second largest economy in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Right now Taiwanese strategy is trying to win the diplomatic battles by contrasting itself with China and investing in anything that helps its image internationally. This includes buying prestigious equipment from the West. Whether or not the West, or the international community would even help Taiwan was a question mark not too long ago. And gaining that sympathy and the diplomatic relationship from certain arms deals is worth more than the weapons themselves. It doesn&#39;t take its security as seriously as the US wants, because it has its own interests that aren&#39;t completely aligned with what the US wants. The US is only so serious about defending Taiwan because it can&#39;t overcommit itself, and is still terrified of completely alienating and confronting China today via a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. And the US can&#39;t give Taiwan a free valuable mutual defense treaty with nothing in return besides an extremely escalatory and confrontational China. So everyone is conducting themselves in a manner that is not straightforward because everyone is anticipating each others actions for escalation.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan&#39;s already won a lot diplomatically this way, and despite everything I&#39;ve said above, the US has pretty much all but officially stated that they&#39;ll defend Taiwan. Which is worth more than anything else they could invest in defense wise. In the lead up to an actual invasion, I don&#39;t doubt all sides will make clear their intentions much more explicitly.</p>\n</div>",

Yes, there were localized shortages of consumables such as ammunition, but in the present situation, we&#39;re talking about a freshly mobilized unit within 90km of their home country. And it&#39;s not that they ran out of consumable supplies, <em>they never had them in the first place.</em> And what&#39;s worse, they weren&#39;t even supplied the single most fundamental imaginable piece of durable equipment: the shovel. I have two shovels in my pickup truck, just in case, and yet an entire fucking battalion of Russian troops couldn&#39;t muster that many digging implements? I fail to see how that is in any way comparable to the supply shortages experienced by US troops in Iraq, which were typically localized, short term, limited to relatively ancillary or novel equipment (e.g., body armor, but during the early days of supplying an entire military with body armor, or the fuck up with the quickclot roll out, etc.), and almost entirely irrelevant in terms of their impact on overall results on the battlefield.

            "body": "Translation:\n\n>Take Kherson and then negotiate: NATO now sees an opening\n\n>BRUSSELS--Negotiations. Even in the near term. When the upper hand is apparent. After the recapture of the southern city of Kherson, where one of the toughest battles against the Russian army is being fought. In the latest analyses circulating in the NATO offices in Brussels, the confrontation in that area is taking on strategic importance not only from a military point of view, but also from a political and diplomatic one. And it is mainly the U.S. that is conveying to the allies the possibility of a breakthrough. Because beating the Russian army in one of the most important gateways to the Sea of Azov and Crimea can mean a real chance to engage in the first real negotiations with Moscow.\n\n>Indeed, in the reports circulating between Atlantic Alliance officials and EU interlocutors, one assumption is made: the Russian military is now under pressure. Unable to react successfully to the Ukrainian advance. Their reaction is focused defensively on destroying infrastructure--power grid, water supply, bridges, roads--building a triple line of trenches and using natural barriers such as the Dnipro River. The goal is to slow the advance of Kyiv troops. Kherson is not just any town: decisive for access to the sea and crucial for control of water resources and river transport. Recapturing it would mean permanently changing the direction of the conflict.\n\n>Precisely for this reason, a message is coming from the US--through Brussels--that is also an invitation to the Ukrainian government: if and when Kherson is recaptured, then negotiations can begin.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take Kherson and then negotiate: NATO now sees an opening</p>\n\n<p>BRUSSELS--Negotiations. Even in the near term. When the upper hand is apparent. After the recapture of the southern city of Kherson, where one of the toughest battles against the Russian army is being fought. In the latest analyses circulating in the NATO offices in Brussels, the confrontation in that area is taking on strategic importance not only from a military point of view, but also from a political and diplomatic one. And it is mainly the U.S. that is conveying to the allies the possibility of a breakthrough. Because beating the Russian army in one of the most important gateways to the Sea of Azov and Crimea can mean a real chance to engage in the first real negotiations with Moscow.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, in the reports circulating between Atlantic Alliance officials and EU interlocutors, one assumption is made: the Russian military is now under pressure. Unable to react successfully to the Ukrainian advance. Their reaction is focused defensively on destroying infrastructure--power grid, water supply, bridges, roads--building a triple line of trenches and using natural barriers such as the Dnipro River. The goal is to slow the advance of Kyiv troops. Kherson is not just any town: decisive for access to the sea and crucial for control of water resources and river transport. Recapturing it would mean permanently changing the direction of the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Precisely for this reason, a message is coming from the US--through Brussels--that is also an invitation to the Ukrainian government: if and when Kherson is recaptured, then negotiations can begin. From a position of strength and not weakness. The point is that the White House for the first time has begun to speculate on such a concrete path. Not without Kherson, however. Not now. Not least because starting negotiations at this stage would only mean giving Moscow&#39;s military time to reorganize. Some strategic cornerstones must, in short, be consolidated first.

Subtracting 2384 thousand (the population of Crimea and Sevastopol as of February 2014) we get 42861 thousand - the list population of Ukraine as of February 2014.\n\nFurther, in subsequent years, all published tables of Ukrstat report on the population of Ukraine, excluding Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\nIt should be noted that even Ukrstat for the reporting periods shows figures that differ by almost + -100 thousand on an annualized basis when taking into account those born or living on the reporting date.\n\nYes, we know that in the DPR and LPR half of the population actually does not live in the republics, we know that in Ukraine a million people live permanently in Poland and other countries. But in the absence of other figures, we take the benchmarks indicated by official statistics. And we keep the rest in mind as correction factors.\n\nPopulation of LDNR\n\nUkrstat believes that as of January 2022, the population of Ukraine is 40,997 thousand. What catches your eye when looking at data by region at the beginning of 2022? The population of the Donetsk region (4059 thousand), Luhansk (2102 thousand). We compare the data of Ukrstat for January 2014, in which the population of the Donetsk region (4338 thousand), Luhansk region (2236 thousand). Too little difference since 2014, given that half of the territories of the regions are not controlled. Thus, all these years, Ukrstat took into account the entire population of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the total number of inhabitants.\n\nFor 2022, there is information on the Internet about the population of the DPR - 2.2 million, LPR - 1.4 million. The calculation of the population was carried out according to the All-Ukrainian census of 2001, taking into account the data of the registry office of the Ministry of Justice of the DPR and the Migration Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the DPR, so no particular reliance should be placed on their reliability. However, this figure may suggest how many residents can be excluded from the count of the number of residents in the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions controlled by Ukraine.\n\nIf we subtract from the figure of Ukrstat 40997 thousand published by the authorities of the DPR and LPR the number of inhabitants in the republics for 2022, then we get 37397 thousand of the population of Ukraine.\n\nSome of the LJs also keep their own records (https://sevabashirov.livejournal.com/371599.html, for example) .... for 2019 - 38.217 million (LJ author's note: this figure was obtained by subtracting the population in cities and areas of Donbass outside the control of Ukraine, using data by area on pop-stat.mashke.org).\n\nEvaluation before the start of the JWO\n\nThe publication of Ukrstat data on the birth of 271 thousand people in 2021 and the birth rate of 7.3 per 1 thousand people of the population can suggest the population of the controlled territory of Ukraine. Consequently, the population for calculating the specific birth rate is just over 37,000 thousand people (271,000/7.1=37,123 thousand people).\n\nWe can add to this number the official number of IDPs recorded by Ukrainian authorities in 2014-2017, approximately 700 thousand people.\n\nBased on this, we obtain an average figure of 38 million of the actual population of Ukraine before the start of the NWO .\n\n \n\nAfter the start of SVO\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Ukrstat reports 40,997 thousand people (including the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and excluding the population of Crimea and Sevastopol).  \n\nLet's subtract some of the territories not controlled by Ukraine.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the Russian Federation controls the Lugansk region (-2102 thousand from the population of U. At the beginning of 2022).\n\nFrom the list of the population of the Donetsk region (Ukrstat data 4059 thousand), we subtract the list number of residents of the DPR (-2200 thousand), also in the DPR, a number of large settlements got out of control of Ukraine: Mariupol (-461 thousand people), Volnovakha (- 20 thousand), Svetlodarsk (-11 thousand), rural areas are not counted. Excluding the territories not controlled by Ukraine, we will agree on 1360 thousand people. in the Donetsk region controlled by Ukraine on a list, or -2699 thousand people. of the population of Ukraine at the beginning of 2022.\n\nKherson region, we consider it sailed away in full force (-1001 thousand people).\n\nOf the total population of 1638 thousand Zaporozhye region, part is controlled by the Russian Federation, except for Zaporozhye (770 thousand people), Orekhov (13 thousand), Gulyaipol (13 thousand), Volnyansk (14 thousand). It turns out over 810 thousand controlled by Ukraine (without accounting of villages), Total -800 thousand people. for Ukraine in the Zaporozhye region from the beginning of 2022.\n\nApproximately so on the papers of statisticians: from January 2022 from 40997 thousand -2699 thousand (DNR); -2102 thousand (Meadow); -1001 thousand (dick); - 800 thousand (Zap) = 34395 thousand of the population assigned to the list for the regions, communities controlled by Ukraine. As always, we can spin + -1 million in any direction, that is, 34-35 million. Rounding up: 35,000 thousand people. This is 85% of the headcount of Ukraine at the beginning of 2022. We can stop at this number.\n\nThe refugee factor\n\nNovaya Gazeta reports: S\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, since the start of the special military operation of the Russian Federation from Ukraine on February 24, 14,325,424 people arrived in neighboring countries. At the same time, 6,941,852 people crossed the border in the opposite direction. (difference 14325 thousand-6941 thousand = 7384 thousand has not returned yet).\n\nHere is such a spread, we believe that a small number left the territories controlled by Kyiv in the Russian Federation. Among the 2,852,395 refugees in the Russian Federation, the vast majority are people from territories controlled by the Russian Federation.\n\nThus, from the number of 34,395,000 people registered outside Ukraine, we can subtract a maximum of 7,384,000 and a minimum of 4,406,000 refugees who left outside the Russian Federation. And an average of 6 million.\n\nNow the list fork of the population located on the territory of Ukraine after exclusion from the count of refugees is from 27,011 thousand to 29,989 thousand .\n\n...",
