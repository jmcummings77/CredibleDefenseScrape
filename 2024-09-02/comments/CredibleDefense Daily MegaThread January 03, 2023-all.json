In the 1990s, some 50 firms vied for big contracts.\n\n> The largest defense companies, like auto makers, manufacture fewer things themselves than they used to and rely more on subcontracting. The broader defense industrial base shrank to 55,000 vendors in 2021 from 69,000 in 2016, and those smaller companies have become a choke point as shortages of labor, chips, rocket motors and other components are hobbling efforts to boost arms production.\n\n> The Pentagon \"is increasingly reliant on a smaller number of contractors for these critical capabilities,\" Halimah Najieb-Locke, deputy assistant secretary of defense in charge of industrial-base issues, said at a recent seminar on consolidation hosted by George Mason University. \"That impacts everybody's ability to ramp production.\"\n\n> Pentagon and antitrust officials have for a decade discouraged further mergers among the six prime contractors while approving most involving the next tier of suppliers. That has started to change.\n\n> Last year, the Justice Department tried to stop a combination between two cybersecurity firms, though a judge this fall declined to block the merger.\n\n> The Federal Trade Commission last January sued to block plans by Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's biggest defense company, to buy rocket maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. for $4.4 billion. Lockheed dropped the deal.\n\n> Aerojet is an example of a small but crucial cog in the defense industry. Labor and supplier issues have delayed its deliveries of rocket motors, which are used in the Javelin and Stinger missiles deployed in Ukraine.\n\n> Aerojet Chief Executive Eileen Drake said in November that a fire at a supplier disrupted production, but that the company had stood up a new manufacturing plant, improved hiring and bolstered its own supply chain.\n\n> Raytheon Technologies Corp., which makes the Javelin along with Lockheed, said it will be 2024 before Aerojet catches up with engine orders.\n\n> A boardroom battle emerged after the collapse of Aerojet's sale to Lockheed, and the company was again put up for sale, culminating in last month's $4.7 billion bid by L3Harris Technologies Inc., the smallest of the six prime U.S. defense companies by sales.\n\n> That deal is also subject to shareholder and regulatory antitrust approval, giving the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the FTC a chance to include the lessons learned from almost 12 months of conflict in Ukraine in their analysis.\n\n> A challenge for the Pentagon and antitrust enforcers is how to measure the potential impact of defense-industry deals. There has been relatively little academic work in the defense sector, in contrast with industries such as healthcare, in part because of a lack of available data and the difficulty of measuring outcomes.\n\n> In the health field, for example, a better outcome might be lower mortality, but the military lacks an agreed metric for success.\n\n> \"It's kind of shocking to me that there's been so little work by economists,\" said Mark Duggan, a professor at Stanford University and the co-author of a 2020 study on defense-industry competition.\n\n> That study didn't turn up any evidence that consolidation led to a significant increase in what the Pentagon pays for weapons, but couldn't determine whether quality and availability had been affected.\n\n> The Pentagon's Ms. Najieb-Locke said the department is working to commission more academic work on the sector and improve the available data to help its analysis of deals.\n\n> \"We are closely reviewing M&A that could further consolidate the [defense industrial base] and hurt competition,\" she said.\n\n> The review of the L3Harris bid to acquire Aerojet will provide a test of whether a deal that makes a company better able to produce more outweighs any anticompetitive effects, said analysts and legal experts, most of whom expect it to be approved.\n\n> \"We don't see regulatory hurdles to an L3Harris-Aerojet deal as there are no vertical integration issues, and the resulting company is still smaller than several larger primes,\" said Byron Callan, a defense analyst at Capital Alpha Partners LLC.\n\n> L3Harris, like Lockheed before it, said being part of a larger group would help Aerojet resolve its challenges and invest in future products. L3Harris said it would apply its \"knowledge to drive both recovery and growth for the business.\"\n\n> While the Pentagon will consider whether an acquisition would help a company's ability to meet production goals, that is unlikely to be sufficient to approve transactions that are found to reduce competition, said Jeff Bialos, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland LLP and a former industrial-affairs chief at the Pentagon.\n\n> El Segundo, Calif.-based Aerojet's importance to national security was highlighted when the Pentagon in February issued an update on the state of defense suppliers, noting the rocket-motor sector as an area of concern. The Pentagon said the shrinking number of providers could stifle innovation and price competition, and leave the military vulnerable to supply disruptions.\n\n> Whatever decision the Pentagon makes on future acquisitions, it will be tough to reverse years of consolidation. The number of big producers of aircraft, ships and missiles has shrunk to two or three in each category.\n\n> The Pentagon has also streamlined military operations in ways that have left less room for multiple contractors. Lockheed Martin's F-35 jet fighter, for instance, is meant to replace many other types of aircraft.\n\n> Similarly, there are only two big shipbuilders, General Dynamics Corp. and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. At most three companies typically submit bids for most big defense contracts.\n\n> \"It's pretty hard to have competition for something like an aircraft carrier when only one facility is able to build it,\" said David Berteau, president of the Professional Services Council, a trade group, and a former Pentagon acquisition official.\n\n> Pentagon officials have expressed concern that bigger companies wield so much political clout that, without competition, investment decisions can be distorted and taxpayers end up spending more on defense equipment.\n\n> Before helping to quash Lockheed's planned takeover of Aerojet, the Defense Department hadn't challenged a big industry deal since 2015 when Lockheed bought the Sikorsky helicopter business from United Technologies Corp.\u2014now part of Raytheon.\n\n> That acquisition, then the first big defense merger in a decade, prompted the Pentagon to take a closer role in advising the Justice Department and the FTC on defense deals. It approved the transaction because Lockheed at the time didn't make helicopters.\n\n> Now, Lockheed is the Pentagon's largest helicopter provider, a position it is trying to extend by protesting its loss to Textron Inc. of a deal worth up to $80 billion to provide hundreds or even thousands of new choppers for the Army.",

The dream of saving communism. But no-one believes in anything any longer. The managers loot the system. Soldiers return defeated in the war to liberate Afghanistan. Includes footage from the AvtoVAZ factory in Togliatti, the funeral of Kim Philby and the April 9 tragedy anti-Soviet demonstrations in Tbilisi.\n\n>Episode 2, **1989-1991**: There are no potatoes in Moscow. Things get worse. Then they get much worse as the rational Communist plan runs out of control everywhere. But McDonald's opens in Moscow.\n\n>Episode 3, **1991**: The empire strikes back. The hardliners bring tanks to Moscow. But power slips through their shaking hands. The Oligarchs publish their manifesto for the future. Money will replace all ideologies. It is safer. Yeltsin seizes power and abolishes communism. Parts of the old Russian empire, including Chechnya and Ukraine, demand their freedom too.\n\n>Episode 4, **1992-1994**: Russia goes through the mirror. There is a new plan to create democracy overnight. Those in charge say it is rational. What it creates is a terrifying dream world where nothing is stable any more. And strange dream visions of Russia's imperial past start to rise up. While people cannot even afford food. But in Moscow women are taught to smile by American cosmetic companies.\n\n>Episode 5, **1993-1996**: Russian society implodes and millions of Russian people fall into the abyss. Many turn to live underground or in the forests. The president attacks parliament with tanks saying he is saving democracy. The oligarchs move billions into offshore zones. Factories have no money. They pay their workers with the very things they make.\n\n>Episode 6, **1994-1998**: The group around the president believe a war in Chechnya will save him. Others want the war to restore the glory of the Russian empire. The Oligarchs seize control of practically everything. In the upside down world gangsters become heroes for defending democracy.\n\n>Episode 7, **1995-1999**: A massive boom spreads through Moscow. It seems that capitalism has arrived. But suddenly the western bankers flee taking the money with them. The Oligarchs take control of a ruined society and search for a new president who they believe will make them safe. And who they can control. The Russian people turn against what they called \"the curse of democracy\". Both communism and democracy are finished.\n\nedit: The current plan by the west is to save Ukraine and to beat Russia with a roll of quarters in a sock.  But despite the tragic immorality of the Russian state, does the west need kind of a plan to rebuild Russia, to save it from itself?  Is there too much stick and not enough carrot?  Russia is going to be defeated and humiliated in this war... and... then what?  The people will be crazier and have more of a victimization complex than ever, won't they?",

Some attacks were carried out using multiple drones, and I don't think they can afford using multiple TU-141 for each attack. Wikipedia reports that 150 TU-141 were built (in the whole soviet union), at best they had some very few tens at the start of the war.\n\nMass production can be anywhere from 1/year to infinite depending on the production capacity of a given nation.

You just tap a button to dash the drone against his target.</p>\n\n<p>And their flexibility in a war scenario is just <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tT0z-urXwv0?t=191\">on another level</a>.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re military equipment developed for war, not half baked hobbyist stuff adapted for the situation.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that they likely cost much more than a mavic pro with 2-3 grenades attached, so they prefer use commercial drones for most of the work. And they&#39;re right. </p>\n\n<p>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a single SB300 costs ten times more a mavic pro.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Will they?

They were performed by modified Tu-141 Strizh drones. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Afaik only one strike was confirmed to be made by tu-141s.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukrobonoprom was talking about a Shahed equivalent, but we would have seen more attacks if they were truly in mass production.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the last few months some drone attacks were carried out in crimea (not only there iirc), a sign that they probably have something similar to shaheds. Some attacks were carried out using multiple drones, and I don&#39;t think they can afford using multiple TU-141 for each attack. Wikipedia reports that 150 TU-141 were built (in the whole soviet union), at best they had some very few tens at the start of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Mass production can be anywhere from 1/year to infinite depending on the production capacity of a given nation.

The numbers have been discussed before, but let's go through them again. Just in terms of 155mm shells, we know that the U.S. will produce 20k shells/month starting soon. We know from the article you highlighted that Europe will be making 25k shells/month. These are also the two numbers Perun cited in his video (240k/annually for the U.S. and 300k annually for Europe.)  Now, that alone gets you to 45k shells/month. Once again, per your article Ukraine is burning through 1,200 shells daily, or 36k shells/month. Hence, **just** U.S. and European shell production exceeds Ukranian burn rate. \n\nWhich means, that through the course of 2023, NATO countries should be able to add to their stockpiles, not deplete them, **even** if we assume that they'll send all of their run-rate production to Ukraine. Now, let's consider Australia. We know that the newly opened Rheinmetall plant has a capacity of 8.3k shells/month. The Thales plant has a similar capacity. That takes us to 16k shells/month just from Australia. Those shells are obviously meant for Australian stores, but if Australia pitches in the way they've committed to pitching in, there's a good chance that depletion from Europe will be lower, or in other words, the load will be carried by all three big producers. \n\nYou add in smaller producers such as Pakistan, and you get to a surplus position that's probably higher than what existed pre-war, even if Ukraine is supplied with as many as 1.8k shells/day. Can't for the life of me recall the source, but distinctly remember reading that Europe wanted to get that number up to 400k annually, and the head of the CSG saying he's going to go to 150k from the 100k supports that. This is all before you consider SK and the U.S.'s ability to serve as an intermediary between their stores/production and Ukraine. \n\nNow, this is all also before you consider all the other NATO artillery standards, mortar, and before you consider Soviet artillery and mortars.

The numbers have been discussed before, but let&#39;s go through them again. Just in terms of 155mm shells, we know that the U.S. will produce 20k shells/month starting soon. We know from the article you highlighted that Europe will be making 25k shells/month. These are also the two numbers Perun cited in his video (240k/annually for the U.S. and 300k annually for Europe.)  Now, that alone gets you to 45k shells/month. Once again, per your article Ukraine is burning through 1,200 shells daily, or 36k shells/month. Hence, <strong>just</strong> U.S. and European shell production exceeds Ukranian burn rate. </p>\n\n<p>Which means, that through the course of 2023, NATO countries should be able to add to their stockpiles, not deplete them, <strong>even</strong> if we assume that they&#39;ll send all of their run-rate production to Ukraine. Now, let&#39;s consider Australia. We know that the newly opened Rheinmetall plant has a capacity of 8.3k shells/month. The Thales plant has a similar capacity. That takes us to 16k shells/month just from Australia. Those shells are obviously meant for Australian stores, but if Australia pitches in the way they&#39;ve committed to pitching in, there&#39;s a good chance that depletion from Europe will be lower, or in other words, the load will be carried by all three big producers. </p>\n\n<p>You add in smaller producers such as Pakistan, and you get to a surplus position that&#39;s probably higher than what existed pre-war, even if Ukraine is supplied with as many as 1.8k shells/day. Can&#39;t for the life of me recall the source, but distinctly remember reading that Europe wanted to get that number up to 400k annually, and the head of the CSG saying he&#39;s going to go to 150k from the 100k supports that. This is all before you consider SK and the U.S.&#39;s ability to serve as an intermediary between their stores/production and Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>Now, this is all also before you consider all the other NATO artillery standards, mortar, and before you consider Soviet artillery and mortars. Think the bigger concern needs to be around barrel shortages. In any case, some narratives die a hard death, but this one definitely seems suspect upon deeper insepection.</p>\n</div>",

However, you're conflating two different topics here: Ukrainian artillery shortfalls and European inventories. This conversation was around the latter, not the former. The point here simply was that Europe can supply Ukraine with its current burn rate of 155mm shells with quite a bit of spare capacity given that almost 300k shells/year of additional production is about to come on stream just in the U.S. and Australia in the next couple months, and a lot more over the next couple years. I'm not sure whether Ukraine will or won't have enough ammo. While you're right that the Ukrainians may need more shells during a proper offensive in an area like Melitopol, and while many pro-Russians are found of touting that the frontage of the war has decreased, this works both ways. There's less area for Ukraine to be using its artillery shells on as well. \n\n>In addition, even when considering global production capacities, there is a zero-sum game at the heart of artillery shell production: the direct correlation between the time it takes to rearm all the European nations and the number of shells immediately expanded in Ukraine.

So, prewar, it was 300+144 = 444k 155mm shells added to inventory each year. With the new production (1,080k) minus Ukrainian current burn rate (480k), total inventory will increase by 600k shells/year. Second, to your point on being vulnerable to Russian aggression, I mean, that's kind of the entire point of supplying Ukraine. Ukraine is blunting Russian aggression with a significantly lower risk of nuclear escalation.

Most former Warsaw pact nations have since joined NATO and switched to Western standards.\n\nI don't think my logic is wrong, I simply made a leap: I assumed that, sooner rather than later, our available global stockpiles of old Soviet ammunition will run out, at which point Western produced or stockpiled 155mm shells and NATO rockets will have to replace all other types.\n\nAccording to the article, Ukraine consumes 1,333 155mm shells a day, with a total daily consumption of 6,000 shells.\n\nCurrent 155mm consumption/year\n\n1,333 155mm x 365 days = 486,545 155mm/year\n\nCurrent total consumption/year\n\n6,000 shells x 365 days = 2,190,000\n\nCurrent total consumption (your number)/year\n\n4,000 shells x 365 days = 1,460,000\n\nThis means that, if we wanted to keep the 155mm requirement as low as it was this year (~20% of total), we (the collective West) would have to find between ~1,000,000 and ~1,700,000 shells of Soviet caliber, which, again, we don't really use or produce. How are we not supply constrained there? Where will we get this ammunition? How is there any solution except replacing it with ammunition and artillery for which we hold stockpiles and maintain production facilities due to NATO standards, which leads back to my previous calculations? \n\n(I've purposefully excluded 105mm, since I believe it's only required by 18 old howitzers from Lithuania)",

            "body": "Russia's maximalist goals in the war are:\n\n1. To create a regime change to pro-Russia leadership; and \n2. To weaken Ukraine to where it cannot resist Russia militarily in the future. \n\nAs such, those are the measurements which will decide whether or not Russia \"wins\".\n\n----\n\nSo my - as Russia - first acknowledgement must be that this war is not going to last 1 or 2 years; if it does, that means I lost. Instead, planning for 5-7 more years would be a better idea. That means planning not just for the short term but the long term to achieve the above two objectives.\n\n**SHORT TERM - 12-24 MONTHS**\n\nNo significant steps toward the goal of a regime change is going to happen in the near term. Even Zelensky and all of his government are killed, there aren't many (if any) pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. There aren't many pro-Russians people. Therefore it is better to focus on weakening Ukraine first economically and militarily first.\n\n**Economically**: Continue attacking on critical infrastructure such as power stations, but also other critical infrastructure such as telecommunications and transportation hubs. The goal is to make it harder for Ukraine to support themselves and their industries, adding pressure to the West for support. In addition, the captured oblasts of Ukraine (Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk) should be stripped of their resources and those sent to Russia. This should be as complete as possible; people should be forcibly relocated, goods shipped and sold, buildings should have any material of value ripped out and then demolished. While this likely won't help fund the war, it will destroy the economic base of those regions. This systematic stripping of resources would be accomplished through mobilized forces, which leads into the next point.\n\n**Militarily**: 2023 will be a dangerous year as the US passed a substantial aid package, new training programs in Europe are being brought online, and even other financial aid programs are being developed. However, 2024 is potentially better year. In Fall 2023, the US has to raise the debt ceiling which likely means another government shutdown for a brief period. Additionally, another funding package will most likely not be as large or as quickly passed. 2024 is an election year and the US Congress tends to not like to work during election years, focusing on getting reelected instead. Without the US, NATO and Europe have much less ability to fund Ukraine. However, Ukraine knows this as well, meaning they will likely be more aggressive to try and deliver decisive victories so as to be able to continue with less or uncertain funding. \n\nIn the near term, then, Ukraine's momentum has to be stopped. Mobilized forces have  helped plug weak points - despite their quality - as the front has gotten smaller, slowing their momentum. These two strategies should be pursued further. Another round of mobilization should be called with the mobilized forces being divided into those who can be supplied and trained, and those used for logistics/manual labor. Those that can be supplied and trained will be used for unit replacement in the spring. Those who are used for logistics/manual labor should be put into units and sent to Ukraine to begin stripping it of resources. This would be designed to act as a training program to get them used to being in units and listening to officers. After three months, they would rotate to actual training for deployment in the fall. \n\nOverall Russian military forces in Ukraine do not have the strength for offensive actions, and those that locally do should not waste it on such actions. Instead, they should focus on defending positions. However, the furthest two Oblasts - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - should be planned to be strategically withdrawn from after stripping their resources. Anything that cannot be taken with should be destroyed (except NPPs). By withdrawing to Donetsk and Luhansk the overall line becomes shorter, making it harder for Ukraine to break through. \n\nWhile this would return occupied areas to pre-February 23rd lines, the objective would be to bleed Ukraine over 2023 and 2024 to exhaust its foreign aid while destroying domestic strength. Also, by creating large swathes of barren lands, it diminishes the will - both domestic and foreign - to fight for those areas as there is nothing to fight over. An additional benefit would be to give time to train mobilized troops and get them experience in combat as well as produce more equipment.\n\n**LONG TERM**\n\nLong term strategy depends on what happens in the US in 2024. If there is still strong financial and military support, a strategy of slowly taking territory to desolate and then retreat from it would be the goal. Ultimately, significant long term support would change the overall strategy to causing Ukraine to depopulate through immigration to Europe, destroying their economic base and ultimately any reason to fight. Eventually support will wane for pro-West leaders and appeasement leadership will come into power. If there isn't strong support, a larger push of overwhelming force to eliminate the Ukrainian Armed Forces and take significant territory - likely everything east of the Dnieper River - to create an allied \"republic\" which can be exploited for its natural resource as \"reparations\". \n\n---\n\nWell, there's my go at it. I don't know if that would actually work as there's a lot of other things that would have to be figured out: where do they get weapons from, how do they keep their economic afloat, do they transition to a war economy, etc. But I figured using a scorched earth strategy in retreat might allow them to wait out Western support by making Ukraine a huge money sink.",

Try to bleed out Ukraine, and by proxy, the West's support for Kyiv.\n\nThe thing is, this is an obvious approach that the West would also look to prepare for. We'd be right back to the game of chicken. And as rough as the state of European energy security might be in the latter half of 2023, EU leaders will likely still hold out on the possibility that the Russian leadership will fail to survive additional waves of mobilization and further economic degradation.\n\nAt a more minute level, it appears that Western aid to Ukraine has reached an equilibrium where the effects of Russian terror attacks have been significantly blunted. Now, if the production of relatively affordable systems continues or even increases at a steady pace, Russia will need to either escalate with more advanced (and expensive) weapon systems or scale back its attacks altogether. This is just one difficult aspect for Russia to be patient on, as it'll unlikely be able to outscale Western production/aid.\n\nIf we zoom back out, one also has to think further about the hypothetical where all Western aid to Ukraine either decreases or stops: As terrible (and unlikely) as this is for Ukraine, does this actually pave the way for a guaranteed Russian victory? That is, should we be careful about underestimating a Ukraine that lacks Western support? \n\nThere are obviously a slew of considerations here - the future state of Ukrainian domestic production; how resilient it can be; can Ukraine reverse-engineer some Western systems if truly needed - but the main point is that even if handicapped, there's the risk (for Russia) that Ukraine has garnered enough mass and momentum to hold out by itself against a renewed maximalist push by Russia. Or at least, hold out long enough to the point where 1) it's dangerous for Russian domestic concerns, or 2) the West feels it can restart its assistance.\n\nThere aren't intended to be counter-points, just further thoughts for consideration.",

And as rough as the state of European energy security might be in the latter half of 2023, EU leaders will likely still hold out on the possibility that the Russian leadership will fail to survive additional waves of mobilization and further economic degradation.</p>\n\n<p>At a more minute level, it appears that Western aid to Ukraine has reached an equilibrium where the effects of Russian terror attacks have been significantly blunted. Now, if the production of relatively affordable systems continues or even increases at a steady pace, Russia will need to either escalate with more advanced (and expensive) weapon systems or scale back its attacks altogether. This is just one difficult aspect for Russia to be patient on, as it&#39;ll unlikely be able to outscale Western production/aid.</p>\n\n<p>If we zoom back out, one also has to think further about the hypothetical where all Western aid to Ukraine either decreases or stops: As terrible (and unlikely) as this is for Ukraine, does this actually pave the way for a guaranteed Russian victory? That is, should we be careful about underestimating a Ukraine that lacks Western support? </p>\n\n<p>There are obviously a slew of considerations here - the future state of Ukrainian domestic production; how resilient it can be; can Ukraine reverse-engineer some Western systems if truly needed - but the main point is that even if handicapped, there&#39;s the risk (for Russia) that Ukraine has garnered enough mass and momentum to hold out by itself against a renewed maximalist push by Russia. Or at least, hold out long enough to the point where 1) it&#39;s dangerous for Russian domestic concerns, or 2) the West feels it can restart its assistance.</p>\n\n<p>There aren&#39;t intended to be counter-points, just further thoughts for consideration.</p>\n</div>",

That&#39;s two years - minimum. Further, it isn&#39;t like Ukraine will just surrender the day American support ends.

Americans have literally never left a conflict because it was costing too much money. Americans leave when they stop being able to explain why they are still fighting. That point is never going to come with Ukraine unless something drastic changes. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is a chance for the US to demonstrate to China why it&#39;s a bad idea to invade Taiwan, a great opportunity to build and use weapons against a near peer, AND the US gets to destroy the Russian army for a generation at the cost of zero American lives.

            "body": "That's just sensationalist.\n\nOne of their problems is a lack of non-commissioned officers in the western sense, which gets said alot. It means when things do need to be adapted it is extremely difficult as the Captain or Lieutenant can't delegate effectively. They have Sargent's but they are just Warrant Officers at best.\n\nTheir BTG's have an inordinate amount of attached specialists. That just adds to the burden on the limited number of officers, as how are they to co-ordinate everything from EW, Artillery, Drones whilst leading a mobilised infantry attack.\n\nOn paper your prescribed number of officers can make this work as they have extensive training and practice. They have veteran soldiers leading their groups (quasi non-coms) that the officer can delegate too. The orders are so extensive that even if something changes the orders tell you what to do meaning the officer isn't overloaded, as they just quickly communicate what to do. Lastly their setup is more identify the target and call in fires rather than complex infantry attacks.\n\nIn reality too many trained lower rank officers have been wiped out leading to higher rank officers doing more and more. Training hasn't kept up with the new gear i.e. no one knows how the jammer is to be properly deployed.  Practice wasn't actually done. There aren't enough veteran soldiers, as they are dead or just weren't there in the first place, and conscripts don't know what to do.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s just sensationalist.</p>\n\n<p>One of their problems is a lack of non-commissioned officers in the western sense, which gets said alot. It means when things do need to be adapted it is extremely difficult as the Captain or Lieutenant can&#39;t delegate effectively. They have Sargent&#39;s but they are just Warrant Officers at best.</p>\n\n<p>Their BTG&#39;s have an inordinate amount of attached specialists. That just adds to the burden on the limited number of officers, as how are they to co-ordinate everything from EW, Artillery, Drones whilst leading a mobilised infantry attack.</p>\n\n<p>On paper your prescribed number of officers can make this work as they have extensive training and practice. They have veteran soldiers leading their groups (quasi non-coms) that the officer can delegate too. The orders are so extensive that even if something changes the orders tell you what to do meaning the officer isn&#39;t overloaded, as they just quickly communicate what to do. Lastly their setup is more identify the target and call in fires rather than complex infantry attacks.</p>\n\n<p>In reality too many trained lower rank officers have been wiped out leading to higher rank officers doing more and more. Training hasn&#39;t kept up with the new gear i.e. no one knows how the jammer is to be properly deployed.  Practice wasn&#39;t actually done. There aren&#39;t enough veteran soldiers, as they are dead or just weren&#39;t there in the first place, and conscripts don&#39;t know what to do. The orders are poorly written, don&#39;t take into account unit strength, or the comms are non existent.

            "body": ">So everyone knows that Russia basically has no officer corps, Duncan has mentioned that. But my question is: Does Russia need an officer corps? \n\nRussia has an officer corps, they're utterly reliant on it because their NCO corps barely existed before the war started and has been gutted since. An unlike many western militaries who delegated many responsibilities to their NCO corps, like training and small unit leadership, Russian junior officers do those things, plus all the planning, often doing maintenance (because they're the only ones well trained enough to understand how the equipment actually works), etc.\n\n>I've read stories about upper level generals literally trying to play an RTS through drone footage\n\nUkrainians are doing the same thing, as did the US Army in previous wars. Micromanaging becomes extremely easy when the technology exists to do it. That's been the case since the telegraph existed, when during the American Civil War Lincoln and Stanton were playing general and telling the Union Army where to go and what to do. \n\nSome armies do it more than others, the Russians especially as they like centralized planning to facilitate large scale operations, complex fires plans, multiple echelons, broad front, etc for better coordination and control, which are the pros for \"Directive Command\" aka \"Orders Tactics,\" whereas the cons are it fails when command and control breaks down and the plan falls apart. \n\n>If Russia had a competent NCO corps would it even be put to good use or useful to them in anyway?\n\nA properly functioning NCO corps could ensure troops do things like 1) Not get drunk 2) Maintain their equipment 3) Stay off their GD cell phones 4) Not commit war crimes because they're angry, bored, psycho 5) Stay awake when necessary 6) Dig proper fighting positions 7) Actually know what they're doing because they're continuously trained, supervised, and mentored\n\nHowever, with an officer corps that has traditionally neutered them, they're less effective. When the officer corps are a bunch of scumbags, monetarily profiting through corruption, are professionally incompetent, etc, that disincentivizes any NCO corps to do the right thing, so they end up abusing their power too. That's why junior lieutenants in the Russian army either turn to apathy and get out of the military at their first opportunity or join the system.\n\nFix the officer corps with mass purges and enforcing of draconian discipline, especially at the top down (shoot them in front of the troops) until the good ones are in charge. Then fix the NCO corps by finding older, mature men that take the job seriously and command respect, then empower them to tackle the junior enlisted problems. Then rebuild the military education system to sustain that culturally for the long term.\n\nBut they won't purge the officer corps because Putin's govt is built on the same corruption that turned the military into this abomination. Trying to fix it now is like trying to get a modern Mafia family to be more honest and honorable, if they had those traits or actually respected them they wouldn't be criminals in those organizations. So Putin and his govt needs to go first. Until that happens nothing changes, they'll just keep reinforcing failure.\n\n>They don't have a military culture of like inspiring the troops or anything as far as I know\n\nYes they do. The Russian officer corps have a centuries old uber brave \"Follow me\" tradition that borders on suicidal, WAY more than most western militaries. Battalion commanders regularly take point during combat ops, it's one of the reasons their officer corps took so many casualties.\n\nIf they're in the rear now giving orders there doesn't even need to be some nefarious reasons, it's probably more to do with not being able to sustain such heavy losses as before, they must protect themselves if their units intend to keep existing.\n\nIn Normandy in WW2, General Bradley told his US Army division commanders that they were all expendable, along with orders that at any given time either they or their assistant division commander must be visiting the front lines (putting their lines in danger) or else they both get relieved for cause. That's even less intense than how the Czarist Russians, Soviet, modern Russians view  it. \n\nBut that only works right up to the point when there are no more generals waiting in the rear for their chance to command a unit after the previous competitor got schwacked, and when there aren't enough colonels to promote, etc. At that point the more senior general either have to tell subordinate senior officers to keep their heads down because they're too valuable to lose unnecessarily, or they need to figure it out on their own and do what's necessary to get the job done. And that's what Russia is facing at the moment, if they don't adopt they will sustain too many casualties in their officer corps to survive, regardless of how many mobilizations they do in the future. \n\nWith regards to the UAF long range PGM targeting of Russian command and control, it's next to impossible to run a proper headquarters nearby to the front lines, especially since they don't have enough digital radios to communicate securely, which means they're easily tracked without IMINT or HUMINT even being considered. That means all critical HQs must place their main HQ outside HIMARS range, so 70-90 km from the front lines. They can still have a forward HQ, likely a convoy of vehicles that moves around all the time, never stationary, but only the commander or the assistant can do that at a time, one just stay with the main HQ, and it still heavily limits the time they can spend on the front lines, especially since those same officers are critical for running their own operations from their HQs due to their centralized planning that puts most of the complicated staff work in their own laps. \n\n>So why even have them in the first place in Russia's perspective?\n\nWho runs the military without them?

On the one hand, they are pushing heavily into solar, wind, batteries and EVs. On the other hand, they continue to expand coal production, which is the dirtiest energy source available . So what exactly is China's goal?\n\nEurope primarily invests in green tech to reduce carbon emissions. Not China. They do it for strategic reasons. Everyone knows that green tech is the future, so they want to dominate that market, and are willing to pay to get a lead.\n\nBut China doesn't care that much about emissions. While Europe was replacing European coal with Russian gas, China is expanding Chinese coal and refusing to invest in Russian gas. If Russia wants to sell gas to China, Russia has to fund the infrastructure itself - potentially at a loss to be price competitive.\n\nSo how is China supposed to save Russia when China arguably is Russia's biggest strategic competitor? It seems to me that Putin has completely lost it in strategic thinking.\n\nSecondly, Trump's foreign policy. Trump is a controversial figure which most people either love or hate. Trump made the idea of containing China mainstream in US politics. Without it, who knows if China wouldn't be the largest economy by the end of the decade?\n\nAt the same time, Trump completely missed the boat in the energy revolution, which is costing the US dearly. Four lost years is a lot in this environment. Catching up with China in EVs will be difficult, although the Biden administration is certainly trying with the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nIf Trump stayed for another four years, China's lead could have been insurmountable.
