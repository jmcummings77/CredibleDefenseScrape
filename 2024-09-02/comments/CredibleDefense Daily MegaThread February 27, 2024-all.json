While the exact contents are unknown, this can contain as many as 3 million 152mm shells. \n\n- Weapons factories are running at full capacity, last year's shipment was not a one-off, and sales of these munitions to Russia are expected to continue.  \n\n- The main Russian payment seems to be food. Food prices in the DPRK have stabilized as a result. There is speculation that Russia may have transferred satellite technology as well. \n\n- Russia is also sending raw materials and inputs to the factories to be turned into shells and rockets. \n\n- While currently limited, if DPRK weapons transfers increase, Russia may send more weapons tech. \n\nI would say that if Russia can keep getting shells for wheat, that's a fairly sustainable deal over the long term. Between domestic and North Korean production, the shell shortage situation could be resolved for Russia, but DPRK production capabilities are unknown and we do know their shell quality is lower. Whether this results in South Korea turning on the 155mm tap could also mean things backfiring and Ukraine getting more supply online, if anyone is willing to pay for it. \n\nhttps://m-en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240227002800315",

Not trying to repeat myself but there is no change in terms of KJU/North Korea being shunned from global institutions and norms now vs a day/month before the policy change announcement. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Has more developed technological capabilities that, while still very far from challenging South Korea or its allies, allows for more tantalizing products for other actors looking to acquire advantages outside of the umbrella of nominal frameworks, thereby fostering new or more developed partnerships.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>North Korea is and will be 90+% dependent on China.  No change there.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly doesn&#39;t change vis a vis South Korea, USA, and Japan.</p>\n\n<p>The increased Russian cooperation is KJU just taking advantage of the happenstance of his current geopolitical circumstance where Putin needed some artillery shells and missiles pronto.  It would&#39;ve happened regardless of the KJU changing the unification policy.</p>\n\n<p>And those are the 5 countries that matter to KJU/North Korea.  And if I&#39;m being real, Japan and Russia are side dishes compared to the other 3.  The rest of the world combined matters even less than PRC alone.</p>\n</div>",

PRC claims that the PRC is representative of China.\n- KMT: same as the PRC, but claims that the ROC is representative of China\n- **DPP: status quo is that Taiwan is already independent and does not need to renounce its ROC status**\n- **US: status quo is peace in the Strait. Our defense agreement with Taiwan is that we will come to their aid regardless of WHO acts to disrupt the status quo.**\n\nThe first major change is that the DPP has been able to redefine what that status quo means in the 8 years under Tsai.

However, military pressure from the mainland and political deadlock forced Chen to abandon this attempt.\n\nTsai's 8 year tenure took a stealthier approach. By redefining the status quo, the DPP under Tsai was able to enact policies that started salami-slicing away ROC identity from Taiwan while also claiming that Taiwan is simply acting to preserve the existing status quo.\n\nThe second major change is that the US redefined China as the only one capable of acting in a way to change the status quo. At least, this was the image that was presented to Taiwan. This gave the impression to Taiwan that there is more room to act and still receive US backing.\n\nThis is what emboldened the more concerted de-Sinicizing efforts of the DPP in Tsai's second term: everything from removing China from the Taiwanese passport, to removing the mention of China from the Double Ten National Day, and more recently, the removal of mandatory classical Chinese classes in high schools.\n\n------\n\nThere was a reason the US developed a policy of strategic ambiguity in the first place during the Cold War: it was supposed to simultaneously deter both Beijing *and* Taipei from unilaterally changing the status quo on their own. \n\nUS military primacy deters Beijing by presenting an insurmountable military challenge to the PLA, while the OLD definition of the status quo meant that if Taiwan seeks independence, then that would be interpreted as Taipei acting unilaterally, and the US will not step in.\n\nWith the status quo redefining that took place around 2014, China interpreted it as the US coming to Taiwan's aid *even if Taiwan were to declare unilateral independence* and started consolidating all military planning for a Taiwan scenario as one that would inevitably involve the US. \n\nThus, China aims for a situation where they cannot be militarily deterred by the US in the hopes of intimidating Taiwan into backing away from bucking the status quo.\n\nIt's the real world equivalent of Rome: Total War when an AI presents the player with: \"accept or we will attack\" demand in exchange for the \"please do not attack\" request.",

The Corps also had to prove that every single item existed and was where the service said it was.\n\n>Lt. Gen. James Adams, the deputy commandant for programs and resources, said one area of focus is automating processes. Today, there are disparate systems where data must be manually moved from one system to another, introducing the opportunity for error.

About 3,000 of the cuts would come from Army special operations forces.\n\n>At the same time, however, the plan will add about 7,500 troops in other critical missions, including air-defense and counter-drone units and five new task forces around the world with enhanced cyber, intelligence and long-range strike capabilities.\n\n>According to an Army document, the service is \u201csignificantly overstructured\u201d and there aren't enough soldiers to fill existing units. The cuts, it said, are \u201cspaces\u201d not \u201cfaces\u201d and the Army will not be asking soldiers to leave the force.\n\n>Instead, the decision reflects the reality that for years the Army hasn't been able to fill thousands of empty posts. While the Army as it's currently structured can have up to 494,000 soldiers, the total number of active-duty soldiers right now is about 445,000. Under the new plan, the goal is to bring in enough troops over the next five years to reach a level of 470,000.\n\n>The planned overhaul comes after two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan that forced the Army to quickly and dramatically expand in order to fill the brigades sent to the battlefront. That included a massive counter-insurgency mission to battle al-Qaida, the Taliban and the Islamic State group.\n\n\nAdditionally, Army Secretary Wormuth also mentioned that production plans for 155mm are on track and in-line with Bush's earlier assessment, made at CSIS, of 36k/month by April, but that the 100k/month would require the Ukraine supplemental.",

And their response rate is probably going to be only a few minutes faster than the F16s. </p>\n\n<p>So the US force was not geared toward fighting a ground conflict without air superiority. It just wasn&#39;t part of the war plans or the acquisition plans. Since about 2016, that started to change and has really picked up steam after 2020. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not a problem of spending. It&#39;s a problem of priorities. And funding Ukraine was never part of the plan.</p>\n\n<p>All of that said, the US still had A TON of weapons to give to Ukraine and has done A LOT to keep Russia at bay.</p>\n</div>",

That wasn't deliberate, as they realized they needed them, they got them. The JDAM, developed in the 90s, is what gave the air forces (USAF. USN, USMC) a strike capability the Army totally lacked, with the only PGMs it had in the early 2000s being GPS guided cluster munition variants of ATACMS and MLRS, which wasn't to hit precision targets, it was to allow fewer systems to have a greater impact. \n\nWhile there were Copperhead laser guided 155mm arty since the 80s, it was expensive and very limited in numbers and who could call them in.

Hence the need for PGMs to limit collateral damage, not to destroy targets, with massed area fire weapons still did fine (and still do). It wasn't until maneuver brigades got drones that they were able to independently find targets from the birds eye view and direct precision fires on them, which dramatically increases effectiveness, and was the reason air delivered PGMs were so useful.\n\nAs sensors got better, as the need for limiting collateral damage grew, as battlespace networking improved, as GPS became more ingrained in all operational planning, the need arose for more Army controlled PGMs, hence the dramatic increase in Operational Needs Statements from the early to mid 2000s, but as i said before, lead times meant those couldn't be mass issued and with entirely new tactics, techniques and procedures until well into the 2010s.\n\nWhich coincided with 2014, a key year for the US Army, as OP Enduring Freedom ended, control of Afghanistan was handed over to their govt, our forces left (small) were ONLY for a training and advising role and would barely leave the wire (minus EOD and SOF).

If the Russians do manage to fire a HARM at them, they instantly shut down and move.</p>\n\n<p>The only counter to that for the Russians is a dedicated DEAD campaign, but considering they can barely pull off SEAD, that&#39;s likely not going to happen. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>this does make me think this may be the work of the Ukrainian Airforce instead of air defenses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian Air Force controls all ground based air defense systems beyond SHORAD that are organic to their maneuver brigades and limited number of higher level air defense regiments attached to the regional operational commands.</p>\n</div>",

The essence of this phenomenon, however, lies solely and only in the news related to the loss of two aircraft of this type of aerospace forces for remaining unknown reasons, and not in the fact that the general public suddenly realized certain problems in equipping the air force.\n\n>Looking through the notes devoted to this, you can see a number of different epithets and characteristics attributed to the A-50U by authors who poorly understand the essence of the issue (who, let's be honest, simply rewrite the functionality of American AWACS from Wiki): air operations control, revealing the operation of air defense systems...\n\n>The problem is that this is not true.\n\n>To better understand what the A-50 is, it is necessary to revisit history. In the 70s, the Soviet military leadership made a number of decisions aimed at changing conceptual approaches in the field of equipping the armed forces. As part of this process, it was planned to re-equip the Air Force in the \u201cAmerican style\u201d - in contrast to the F-16 and F-15 combination, a MiG-29 and Su-27 combination was created, and aviation, following the model of the US Air Force, was to receive its own reconnaissance and control capabilities base of the A-50 AWACS fleet. The problem was that the experience of building aircraft of this type in the USSR was extremely specific - for example, in the person of the Tu-126, whose task was to detect high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and strategic bombers in areas inaccessible to ground-based air defense.\n\n>This specific experience was fully transferred and implemented in the A-50. Already at the stage of its appearance, the aircraft was inferior to its serial competitor in the form of the American E-2, but what was much worse, the concept embedded in it had a direct impact on the level of technical solutions, as a result of which the A-50 turned out to be an aircraft of the level of the late 50s : he could not implement his own intelligence data and control the air battle, and also turned out to be catastrophically \u201cblind\u201d at low altitudes and could not work on the earth\u2019s surface or water surface.\n\n>In the 80s, Soviet naval missile-carrying aviation conducted a series of local exercises designed to test the capabilities of the A-50 at sea (information about this is in the public domain - it is not secret). The result was an unpleasantly surprising discovery - the A-50 radar was unable to detect even ships on the open sea. For him, this was a \u201cblind spot\u201d - after all, the designers implemented in it the familiar and understandable features of the Tu-126, without even trying to comprehend the complete change in the nature of modern air threats and changes in the tactics of warfare in the air (while combat aviation already during the Vietnam War began to rapidly \u201csnuggle to the ground\u201d, operating at low altitudes).\n\n>Perhaps the negative features of the A-50 would have eventually been eliminated - after all, for the USSR it was the first project of this kind, especially since the Soviet leadership made great efforts to develop combat data exchange networks (thanks to which the aircraft would be able to realize its potential and as a flying command post), but... The USSR was gone, and the A-50 remained a \u201cserial prototype\u201d. The modification represented by the A-50U hardly affected the main technical solutions incorporated into the aircraft, therefore it is simply incorrect to draw any analogies between it and foreign AWACS models.\n\n>The loss of such rare aircraft in itself is, of course, tragic and sad, but it can hardly have any significant impact on the course of combat operations or the capabilities of the aerospace forces - simply because the actual functionality of the A-50U was extremely narrow and very remotely influenced the course of air operations. In essence, it boiled down to monitoring the airspace over Ukrainian territory and tracking the movement of those aircraft that were at altitudes above 3000 meters - that is, recording the work of the few Ukrainian transport aircraft and tactical aircraft moving between airfields.",

As part of this process, it was planned to re-equip the Air Force in the \u201cAmerican style\u201d - in contrast to the F-16 and F-15 combination, a MiG-29 and Su-27 combination was created, and aviation, following the model of the US Air Force, was to receive its own reconnaissance and control capabilities base of the A-50 AWACS fleet. The problem was that the experience of building aircraft of this type in the USSR was extremely specific - for example, in the person of the Tu-126, whose task was to detect high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and strategic bombers in areas inaccessible to ground-based air defense.</p>\n\n<p>This specific experience was fully transferred and implemented in the A-50. Already at the stage of its appearance, the aircraft was inferior to its serial competitor in the form of the American E-2, but what was much worse, the concept embedded in it had a direct impact on the level of technical solutions, as a result of which the A-50 turned out to be an aircraft of the level of the late 50s : he could not implement his own intelligence data and control the air battle, and also turned out to be catastrophically \u201cblind\u201d at low altitudes and could not work on the earth\u2019s surface or water surface.</p>\n\n<p>In the 80s, Soviet naval missile-carrying aviation conducted a series of local exercises designed to test the capabilities of the A-50 at sea (information about this is in the public domain - it is not secret). The result was an unpleasantly surprising discovery - the A-50 radar was unable to detect even ships on the open sea. For him, this was a \u201cblind spot\u201d - after all, the designers implemented in it the familiar and understandable features of the Tu-126, without even trying to comprehend the complete change in the nature of modern air threats and changes in the tactics of warfare in the air (while combat aviation already during the Vietnam War began to rapidly \u201csnuggle to the ground\u201d, operating at low altitudes).</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the negative features of the A-50 would have eventually been eliminated - after all, for the USSR it was the first project of this kind, especially since the Soviet leadership made great efforts to develop combat data exchange networks (thanks to which the aircraft would be able to realize its potential and as a flying command post), but... The USSR was gone, and the A-50 remained a \u201cserial prototype\u201d. The modification represented by the A-50U hardly affected the main technical solutions incorporated into the aircraft, therefore it is simply incorrect to draw any analogies between it and foreign AWACS models.</p>\n\n<p>The loss of such rare aircraft in itself is, of course, tragic and sad, but it can hardly have any significant impact on the course of combat operations or the capabilities of the aerospace forces - simply because the actual functionality of the A-50U was extremely narrow and very remotely influenced the course of air operations. In essence, it boiled down to monitoring the airspace over Ukrainian territory and tracking the movement of those aircraft that were at altitudes above 3000 meters - that is, recording the work of the few Ukrainian transport aircraft and tactical aircraft moving between airfields.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

        "body": "The article below from Responsible Statecraft asks one very important question about the CIA massive operation in Ukraine that started in 2014:\n\nWhat was its ultimate goal? Both Obama's and Trump's administration proclaimed *de-escalation and promoting regional stability* as their goals. In what way did establishing 12 secret CIA bases along the Russian border serve this purpose?
