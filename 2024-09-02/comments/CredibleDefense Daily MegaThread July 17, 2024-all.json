Substantial Russian interference with the evacuation was not reported.*\n\n*Krynky and the swampy, wetland terrain around it had been widely profiled in national media as the scene of months of bitter but successful defensive battles fought by elite Ukrainian Marines, backed by omnipresent crowd-sourced drones, against more numerous Russian forces deploying a massive firepower advantage.*\n\n*Ukraine army official statements on Tuesday made no direct reference to retreat from Krynky. However, a report by the state-run Suspilne Novyni confirmed the village had been abandoned \u201ca few weeks ago.\u201d*\n\n*On Wednesday, a Ukrainian Army Chief of Staff (ACS) daily situation report stated Kyiv troops still were present and holding positions on the left bank of the Dnipro in Kozachi Laheri, a village adjacent to Krynky.*\n\n*Russian forces attempted a single assault against Kozachi Laheri on Tuesday, which failed, that official statement said. The last time Ukraine\u2019s military reported ground combat in Krynky was July 11.*\n\n*Soldiers and volunteers describing combat conditions inside the village in recent months reported less than 200 fighters. Most members of Ukraine\u2019s Marine Corps along with a small number of territorial defense unit volunteers, had been holding out in Krynky since March.*\n\n*Embattled Ukrainian troops for months had only able to receive food and ammunition, and evacuate wounded, aboard small boats targeted by Russian strike drones. Kyiv\u2019s abandonment of Krynky village marked a possible end to months of attempts by Ukrainian forces to hold liberated territory and expand it.*\n\n*The Ukrainian military possesses tactical bridging equipment, among it NATO-standard assault bridges donated by Germany. In the more than six months since the capture of the Krynky toehold, top Ukrainian commanders never attempted to bridge the Dnipro River, a major water obstacle comparable to the Rhine. Any crossing attempt would have been destroyed by Russian Air Force bombers operating mostly freely in air space over the Kherson sector, military analysts say.*\n\n*Powerful glide bombs launched by the Russian Air Force pounded  Marine positions with near-impunity for months, because Ukrainian air defenses in the sector are too thin and short-ranged to interfere with the long-range Russian air strikes against the bridgehead.*\n\n*That Russian air bombardment and ground assaults against Ukrainian positions have left Kryky village, once a pleasantly green waterfront hamlet with some 200 individual family homes and cottages, almost totally flattened.*\n\n*According to Russian battle reports, fighting was still in progress in the Dnipro River lowlands near Kherson. Most engagements were infantry skirmishes amidst the lower river\u2019s labyrinth of low-lying islands and canals, but Russian air strikes were continuing, the pro-Russia Dva Majora milblogger reported on Wednesday.*\n\n*Official, Kremlin-controlled information platforms in March declared the Dnipro River\u2019s entire left/south bank cleared of Ukrainian forces, angering milbloggers who said it was fake news and that the Ukrainian Marines were still holding out there.*",

The Australian weapons ranges offer operational flexibility for the long-range tests planned under SCIFiRE.\"\n\nThe [Woomera test range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Woomera_Range_Complex) is described by the RAAF as \"the largest land-based test range in the western world\", even going by the official boundaries.\n\n> The SCIFiRE agreement, established in 2020, is a partnership to advance the development and testing of hypersonic cruise missiles like the [HACM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_Attack_Cruise_Missile). Initially, the program involved Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon, which presented initial designs for evaluation in 2022. Raytheon emerged as the winner.

Especially at the outset (but I believe even still?), there are less Tanks/AFVs/IFVs being used in Kharkiv than in the Donbass, and the human toll of the offensive seems to be incredibly high relative to the toll on heavy equipment. \n\nWe've also seen the recent spiking of signing bonuses in Moscow to around 1.7 million rubles (alongside increases elsewhere) to continue to achieve as-close-to-desired-as-possible enlistment numbers, while casualty estimates over the past 3 weeks or so (such as those from Meduza) have marked 2024 as the bloodiest period of the entire war for Russia between Avdiivka and Kharkiv. It seems as though the RUAF is already less mechanized with heavy equipment than it has been historically (with continually increasing use of desertcrosses, motorcycles, and turretless shed-tanks for assault unit transport) and that they have already been paying for it with accelerated casualties.\n\nIn theory, it's only going to continue to get worse from here if they keep trying to push at this pace. Two of the key questions I have for the beginning of 2025 are: \n\n1) What is the state of RU artillery? It's been subjected to far less attrition, but barrel wear and ammunition are their own constraints. Recently, 130mm guns have been pulled from storage, and more and more towed guns seem to be used, but the actual guns are far less likely to be the bottleneck than ammunition. As a related note, how well will the RUAF be able to use drones as a stop-gap substitute compared to the UAF over the past few months when US aid lagged?\n\n2) With the loss of a significant degree of mechanization and the RUAF doctrinal preference for offensive action, will a more and more equal (or locally lopsided) equipment ratio enable more Ukrainian offensive potential? That is, how will the loss of mechanization affect Russian defensive capabilities. The answer is almost definitely not \"minimally\" or \"maximally\", but somewhere awkwardly in the middle, and it's a question that's hard to answer as the role that Russian armored/mechanized/mobile reserves played during the summer 2023 offensive is, as far as I know, somewhat opaque from an OSINT perspective. For systems which have been historically problematic defensive enablers, like the Ka-52, how will the availability of ATACMS curtail their use as a QRF/defensive enabler and prevent them from making the loss of significant mobile tank reserves irrelevant?\n\nSometime in mid-late 2025, assuming similar rates of attrition and less-intense but ongoing Russian offensives, it feels like we'll have to reach an inflection point where RUAF mechanization is so degraded that it enables UAF offensive opportunities. The last question there is whether the UAF will have enough trained manpower by that point (they should, if the first mobilizations from the new law are any indication--trained is maybe another thing) and whether they will have continued support from the US (or whether European production will be at sufficient quantities at that point, though more is better).\n\nIn the process of writing this out, it's really become clear, I think- even though it's easy to call the situation a mostly static, near-deadlock over the past year, there are so many contingent factors which impact one of the next most likely turning points of the war in mid-2025, it's no wonder neither side is showing any willingness to seriously negotiate or give concessions.",

Russia&#39;s mobilization effort is at the moment using flesh to protect steel but this is a false savings and even as they bring more production online the attrition rate will more likely than not go up to such a degree that the additional production is only stemming the bleeding of equipment than making a significant gain in relative force projection capability.</p>\n</div>",

You can check on wiki or statista but if i recall its arpund 160 billion for russia combined and Norway passed the 1600 billion/1.6 trillion).\n\nThere are a few countries who followed this model and they dwarf the russian one. The russian is a big one amd nothing to sneeze at, but it would be enough to fund the war for a year approx (7% of their GDP, most of what I say is napkin map, so feel free to correct me) and this would mean they have no safety net between them and oil prices fluctation. Meaning that they can be brought to their knees with just oil price. The Saudi funds together dwarf russia for this very reason. \n\nYes PPP helps them a lot but its not a saving grace alone.",

And Israel is losing by not winning. In this equation, as long as the Axis is able to impose costs, the IDF will be unable to construct a victory narrative\u2014despite any tactical achievements. More so, since Oct. 7 the cumulative effect of dispersed and yet coordinated armed operations launched by Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iraqi armed groups have increased the pressure on Tel Aviv.
