I continue to be very curious about the Czech initiative, now that it's up to 1,5 million shells among 155mm and 122mm (was it also said 152mm?). Evidence came out this week, for the first time, that South-Korean made 155mm shells are being used by the Ukrainians directly, and not just to allow the Western countries to replenish their own stocks. I wonder whether the 155mm shells produced by Rheinmetall in South Africa could be used directly by the Ukrainians or not. Turkey as well should be a big supplier, they have large stocks and no issue in supplying Ukraine directly. Most likely Pakistan, as happened in the past; maybe India also, according to rumors of the last weeks (I read that Ukrainian artillery crews forbid journalists visiting their positions to take pictures of shells). \n\nThe Czechs said that among the suppliers there are also allies of Russia. I also find it very plausible that Morocco and Egypt are going to be important suppliers. They are large users of 155mm howitzers and most likely have huge stocks, being very large armies. For Morocco it should not be a problem, being a pro-Western country (they had already shipped dozens of T-72Bs to the Czech Republic where they were upgraded to T-72EAs for Ukraine); for Egypt maybe it's not so easy, but I suspect that the recent funding agreement with the European Union may have been a *quid pro quo* after a potential agreement to sell shells in order to be shipped directly to Ukraine. I rule out Algeria, although possibly Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE and Qatar could also be involved in the Czech project.",

If passed, it would mark the largest number of the close-air support stalwarts sent to the boneyard -- the final resting place for scrapped aircraft.\n\n> It was announced earlier this month that Maryland's Warfield Air National Guard Base at Martin State Airport is the preferred location to transition from a flying mission with aging A-10 aircraft to a cyber wing mission -- leaving the future of those jobs up in the air.\n\n>\"Divestment of the 21 A-10s at Warfield ANGB is forecasted to begin in fall 2024,\" the Air Force said in a press release. \"Manpower numbers are expected to remain neutral but will be finalized over the next year.\"\n\n> Rose Riley, a Department of the Air Force spokeswoman, told Military.com last year that the service plans to shrink the Tactical Air Control Party, or TACP, job field to about 2,130 positions -- a decrease of 44%, according to the service. The Air Force said the manning is now \"roughly\" 3,700 airmen.\n\n>Troops-In-Contact, an advocacy group led by A-10 and air support veterans, issued a statement after the cuts were revealed saying close-air support, or CAS, is crucial to the military. The group argued that the results of cutting TACPs could be deadly. The group has also fought against cuts to the A-10 Warthog.\n\n>\"If successful, this plan would kill the CAS profession and cripple America's CAS capability,\" the group wrote on its website. \"Ground troops would be supported, if at all, by CAS amateurs in a small, expensive fleet of fragile aircraft that are far less effective. In low-intensity conflict, that will cost lives.\"\n\nThese lobbyists will look increasingly foolish as the proliferation of drones at the squad level increases and light support aircraft remain an option. It just doesn\u2019t seem like heavy, manned CAS aircraft have a place in modern war. The USAF is tired of pretending they do.\n\n> The A-10 retirements come as the Air Force continues to invest in the F-35, which was billed early on as a close-air support replacement for the Warthog. It also comes as the service pivots overall to a focus on the Pacific and China, leaving the Middle East in the rearview.\n\n>Dan Grazier, a senior policy fellow with the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan, nonprofit watchdog group, obtained a copy of an A-10 and F-35 flyoff testing report that did not paint the F-35 as the clear winner between the two, he reported.\n\n>Grazier said the continued retirements of the A-10 will leave the service empty-handed when it comes to close-air support abilities.\n\nSuch a strange argument. CAS that can\u2019t be carried out by an F-35 might be able to be supplemented by additional fires such as from drones, but it certainly won\u2019t be able to be carried out by an A-10. A-10s will be irrelevant in a Pacific war. \n\nThe USAF is being realistic about what their situation is and divesting itself of so many of these largely useless aircraft.",

The USAF is tired of pretending they do.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The A-10 retirements come as the Air Force continues to invest in the F-35, which was billed early on as a close-air support replacement for the Warthog. It also comes as the service pivots overall to a focus on the Pacific and China, leaving the Middle East in the rearview.</p>\n\n<p>Dan Grazier, a senior policy fellow with the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan, nonprofit watchdog group, obtained a copy of an A-10 and F-35 flyoff testing report that did not paint the F-35 as the clear winner between the two, he reported.</p>\n\n<p>Grazier said the continued retirements of the A-10 will leave the service empty-handed when it comes to close-air support abilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Such a strange argument. CAS that can\u2019t be carried out by an F-35 might be able to be supplemented by additional fires such as from drones, but it certainly won\u2019t be able to be carried out by an A-10. A-10s will be irrelevant in a Pacific war. </p>\n\n<p>The USAF is being realistic about what their situation is and divesting itself of so many of these largely useless aircraft.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "The Russians have posted a picture of the Lyutyi drone so more details are confirmed.  \n\n[\u200bWhat Does Lyutyi Ukrainian Drone, which Destroys Russian Oil Refineries, Consist of? | Defense Express | March 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/what_does_lyutyi_ukrainian_drone_which_destroys_russian_oil_refineries_consist_of-9875.html)\n\n*Occupiers showed photos of wreckage of the Lyutyi long-range kamikaze drone for the first time, which has already hit more than a dozen oil refineries in Russia. According to numerous videos filmed in Russia, the main instrument of these strikes is the Lyutyi Ukrainian long-range kamikaze drone. But it's worth noting that not all drones reach their targets, because Russia still has air defense capabilities.*\n\n*Only now, the Russian federation has shown the wreckage of the Lyutyi drone, which answers some questions about its design and warhead. But it should be noted that fragments of the drone in the photo are in the wrong order because Russians did not put the certain parts of the drone correctly. Its engine should be located in the tail section of the drone. Because it has a pusher configuration, but not a tractor one.*\n\n*Russian invaders also showed the warhead of Lutyi. Its weight estimated to be 50 kg, which corresponds to the Shahed-136 kamikaze drone. It is obviously a high-explosive fragmentation warhead in body with a ready-made fragmentation notch.*\n\n*Of course, the analysis of this wreckage may provide Russia with some information about the capabilities of the drone and its guidance system. But now Moscow is demonstrating a very delayed reaction to counter the destruction of its oil refining infrastructure. Despite the obviousness of the strike sites, no significant concentration of air defense means around them has been noticed.*\n\nAlso, a little over a week ago I [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b9ndh7/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_08_2024/ktwzu4k/) that Russians were using long fiber optic cables to make FPV drones EW resistant.  The UAF are now doing the same.  Adaptions must be made because EW has gotten better.  There are reports that Russia now has another type of drone jammer.\n\n[Russian Company Created Dome-Type Drone Jammer to Shield Armored Units | Defense Express | March 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/russian_company_created_dome_type_drone_jammer_to_shield_armored_units-9883.html)\n\n*Russian state media reported that the Kaysant company has developed a system to protect Russian armored vehicles from first-person vision (FPV) drones. A representative from Kaysant stated that the company has created a dome-type drone jammer specifically designed for installation on vehicles, weighing just two kilograms, according to the Institute for the Study of War.*\n\n*The K-1000 system is capable of disrupting drones operating at frequencies of 800 and 900 megahertz, with plans to expand its capabilities to cover three to four frequencies. Kaysant has started production of these systems and has already received orders from the Russian government. Discussions are ongoing regarding the potential mass delivery of these systems to frontline areas.*\n\n[\u200bUkrainian Developers Present Optical Fiber FPV Drone (Video) | Defense Express | March 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/ukrainian_developers_present_optical_fiber_fpv_drone_video-9873.html)\n\n*The transition from radio channels to optical fiber in FPV drones marks a significant leap forward, especially in military contexts, where reliability and security are paramount*\n\n*FPV drones utilizing optical fiber instead of traditional radio channels for control and video transmission represent a highly promising avenue for advancing this technology, particularly in military applications. Russian forces have been actively exploring this direction, testing such drones in combat scenarios. Concurrently, Ukrainian developers, such as Dronarnia, have also made significant strides. For instance, they showcased a prototype FPV drone named Banderyk-Strichka, which employs optical fiber for control.*\n\n*The Banderyk-Strichk drone boasts a payload capacity of up to 3 kg, a flight duration of 15 minutes and a tactical radius of 1 km, although these specifications were achieved some time ago. The primary emphasis lies in gaining expertise in implementing optical fiber control rather than the drone\u2019s specific parameters. Unlike its russian counterpart, this drone utilizes a thinner optical fiber, enabling it to execute aggressive maneuvers without damaging the fiber, as evidenced in video footage.*\n\n*Optical fiber control offers distinct advantages, including immunity to electronic warfare systems and enhanced image quality for operators. This setup increases drone effectiveness and accuracy in targeting. Moreover, it ensures operational secrecy by evading detection through radio-electronic reconnaissance means and mitigates interference issues associated with radio frequency control, facilitating the management of multiple drones simultaneously.*\n\n*Additionally, leveraging optical fiber control permits centralizing computing power for tasks like machine vision, utilized in target recognition and attack strategies, at the control station rather than onboard the drone, which is a more cost-effective approach.*",

According to numerous videos filmed in Russia, the main instrument of these strikes is the Lyutyi Ukrainian long-range kamikaze drone. But it&#39;s worth noting that not all drones reach their targets, because Russia still has air defense capabilities.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Only now, the Russian federation has shown the wreckage of the Lyutyi drone, which answers some questions about its design and warhead. But it should be noted that fragments of the drone in the photo are in the wrong order because Russians did not put the certain parts of the drone correctly. Its engine should be located in the tail section of the drone. Because it has a pusher configuration, but not a tractor one.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Russian invaders also showed the warhead of Lutyi. Its weight estimated to be 50 kg, which corresponds to the Shahed-136 kamikaze drone. It is obviously a high-explosive fragmentation warhead in body with a ready-made fragmentation notch.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Of course, the analysis of this wreckage may provide Russia with some information about the capabilities of the drone and its guidance system. But now Moscow is demonstrating a very delayed reaction to counter the destruction of its oil refining infrastructure. Despite the obviousness of the strike sites, no significant concentration of air defense means around them has been noticed.</em></p>\n\n<p>Also, a little over a week ago I <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b9ndh7/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_08_2024/ktwzu4k/\">posted</a> that Russians were using long fiber optic cables to make FPV drones EW resistant.

So it's not just a matter of evaluating the legality of any seizure- it's also considering Russia's likely retaliation.\n\nIf Russia additionally managed to get court orders to seize trillions in EuroClear funds in places like Hong Kong it could destabilize the world's financial system.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-frozen-russian-assets-generate-15-20-bln-until-2027-eu-official-says-2024-03-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-frozen-russian-assets-generate-15-20-bln-until-2027-eu-official-says-2024-03-12/)\n\nBRUSSELS, March 12 (Reuters) - Russian assets, frozen in the European Union after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, are likely to generate between 15 billion and 20 billion euros in after-tax profits until 2027, depending on the evolution of global interest rates, a senior EU official said.\n\nPart of the profits, as well the tax on the gross amount, is likely to be transferred from the EU to Kyiv on a regular basis, but some of the money will have to stay in the West to build a buffer against the expected Russian retaliation which could destabilise the global financial system, the official said.\n\nSome 70% of all Russian assets immobilised in the West is held in the Belgian central securities depository Euroclear, which has the equivalent of 190 billion euros worth of various Russian central bank securities and cash.\n\n\"We want to help Ukraine, but we will also have to ensure that there is no breach of financial stability,\" said the EU official, who is close to negotiations on the use of the assets.\n\n\"The moment the war ends and all settlements can be made, all the money that was provisionally retained will also be transferred to Ukraine. But we need a significant amount in Euroclear...beause Euroclear will face a lot of claims,\" the official said.\n\nThe claims are to come from the Russian central bank which, through Russian courts that do not recognise Western sanctions, is likely to put its hands on the 33 billion euros of Euroclear money in the national securities depository in Moscow.\n\nRussia could also take legal action to seize Euroclear cash in securities depositories in Hong Kong and Dubai, the official said, and more lawsuits against are likely from Western banks which lost their money invested in Russia, the official said. \"That's the mechanism how Euroclear could be totally emptied, basically,\" the senior EU official said.\n\nIf Euroclear were to run out of capital, the Belgian central bank would have to withdraw its licence, likely causing a global financial crisis because Euroclear has assets in custody of 37 trillion euros, the official said.\n\nThe Commission is to present a proposal next week on how much of the profits over the next four years can immediately go to Ukraine and in what form, and how much should be kept to create the safety buffer. There should also be an emergency mechanism should Euroclear get in trouble, the official said.Belgium, which taxes the profits that Euroclear makes on the Russian cash at 25%, expects to get 1.7 billion euros in tax from that in 2024 of which 1.5 billion will be sent to Kyiv this year and the rest in 2025, the official said.\n\nFrom the start of the war until last February, the profits generated by the Russian assets amounted to 5.2 billion euros.But because the EU only decided to clarify the legal situation of the money on February 12th, profits accrued until then will have to wait until the final settlement at the end of the war to be transferred to Ukraine, the official said, because it would be very difficult to access them retroactively.",

In other words, the election must show that the incumbent ruler has popular support and is without alternatives, but also that the regime is able to define and enforce the limits of acceptable social behavior.</p>\n\n<p>ensure that people (and elites) are interested in the continuation of the war because they draw financial ... benefits from it.</p>\n\n<p>European companies had supplied equipment worth more than $630 million to the Arctic LNG 2 project, one of Russia\u2019s flagship energy export projects over the past two years. This in itself would not be particularly surprising, however the shipments continued even after the project was sanctioned by the US last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The whole thing was in full opposition to Putin, went against his orders and condemnations, and even came on the heels of Prigozhin condemning the whole war as being based on lies about Ukrainian agression, NATO, etc., saying the only reason Russia invaded was because the war was wanted by the \"Russian oligarchs\" ( https://t. me/concordgroup_official/1279 ).\n\nIMO these aren't just the words of someone who wants better conditions for his men, they are the words of someone who wants power, or at least to have a say on how things are done, and who is directly challenging the executive branch to get it. Framing it simply as Putin \"being misled\" rather than lying means that, in case of success, Putin could at least remain nominally in charge, but that Prigozhin believed, at a minimum, that he had the authority to correct the President's interpretation of the situation and the decisions he makes based on them.\n\nSo personally I find even the \"mutiny\" framing maybe fails to fully show what success would have looked like, which IMO is Prigozhin taking on the role of a rival power to Putin and attempting to further undermine Russian elites. Of course there are many problems with this though (no one among the actual elites liked or trusted Prigozhin, the only members of the Russian population who like him are the ultranationalists, he would have had to count 100% on his men and a military which for the most part wouldn't have supported such a course of action either).\n\nIn the end though, given the outcome of his march, I'm not sure the discussion is that meaningful.

Again at 11:00 he says Russia should have used its initial successes to reach a deal with Kyiv, and then blames Russian leadership for deciding to send more soldiers in instead to reach a more crushing victory, without fully committing.\n\nHe also criticizes it for being badly led and organised as you say, for lacking commitment once it was too late to come back. Even seems to imply they should have bombed Warsaw at one point lol. I'm not saying he would have ended the war or that it was his goal, I'm saying his criticism went way beyond how his men were treated, and that he claimed to want to change the way the war was conducted.",

But that's hard to justify after earlier being defeated conventionally in a brutal war. At that point, most of the belligerents are exhausted and ready for the war to end. \n\nWithout getting into the specifics of whether it's even possible or not, how many existing UAF combatants are going to be motivated to fight for another decade after 3 years minimum of a meat grinder war? How many civilians are going to support them?

Repopulating seized areas with Russian citizens or locals sympathetic to their cause.\n\nAppointing local strongmen and their militia (or even gang) structures as the enforcers of their own private fiefdoms.\n\nI\u2019ll use the example of the Syrian Civil War to illustrate Russia\u2019s modus operandi in COIN.\n\nRussia outright saved the Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad from collapse in September of 2015. Yes, their were many more factors at play (US/coalition Intervention vis-a-vis the Islamic State, Iranian / Hezbollah train, equip, and advise of local Shia militias / import of Shia foreign fighters, Turkish intervention, Kurdish split loyalties etc etc etc). At the very least, IMO, were it not for Russia the Syrian government would have collapsed in western Syria, and likely would have broken down into Shia/Alawi/Druze/Christian/secularist mini-states controlled by local warlords. Anyways:\n\nRussia reorganized the efforts of the Syrian Arab Army to focus on key terrain, populations, and resources- while at the same time designating \u2018quarantine zones\u2019 for areas they knew the Syrian military was unlikely to ever gain control back over. The key terrain was ensuring Syrian government ground lines of communication first, then shaping the operational space with the limited resources they had by massing pro-government forces in focused offensives with limited geographic objectives (instead of trying to fight everywhere at once weakening your ability to hold ground and take ground, it\u2019s better to mass and fix your enemies to a fight and ensure they don\u2019t have the resources to attack you where you\u2019re weak elsewhere). Once shaping operations succeeded- major campaigns were launched- recaptured of Hama countryside, final phases of the Battle of Aleppo, recapture of East Ghouta, etc. At the same time, they identified the \u2018quarantine zone\u2019 that they could push enemy combatants / unfriendly populations into.\n\nTargeted terrorization, depopulation, and deportation of unfriendly groups is a key part of this. Terrorization of unfriendly populations pushes out the people that would become the insurgency. \u201cIndiscriminate\u201d barrel bombings, shelling, even the chemical attacks weren\u2019t indiscriminate. They were primarily done to depopulate the areas that they targeted of potential opposition to the \u201cquarantine zones\u201d (ie Idlib) that the Russian military identified. As much of meme Assad\u2019s Green Buses became, they served their purpose well- the people that got on them to go to quarantine zones were driven out because they were targeted to be driven out. Repopulation then occurred- in many instances Shia militia groups from Lebanon, Afghanistan, or Iraq then became the inhabitants of \u201cliberated\u201d areas.\n\nStrongmen- easy enough to explain. Once an area was recaptured it was put under direct control of people who can best be described as warlords with their own security apparatus, who were given free reign over their areas so long as the area was maintained under \u201cgovernment\u201d control. Syria up until today is still very much administered under this system.\n\nParallels to Ukraine are easy to make from this example in how they go about the conventional war and plan for COIN.\n\nOnce the calculus changed after the disastrous \u201cwhole of country\u201d campaign in 2022, Russia shifted to shaping operations and \u201cquarantine zones\u201d. Western Ukraine, past the Dnipro is the quarantine zone to push unfriendly populations into through terrorization, depopulation, and deportation. It\u2019s as much a feature as it is a consequence of battle that cities like Mariupol, Bakhmut, Avdiivka etc have been completely destroyed. It pushes those populations that would become insurgencies out (or outright kills them) for the area to be resettled by Russians later. Civilians who remain whose loyalties are suspect can just be deported later- either to the \u201cquarantine zones\u201d under Ukrainian control in the west, or deported deep into Russian Siberia where they lack any support system and are dependent on the state. As we saw in Mariupol- children can essentially be trafficked back to mainland Russia and fostered to Russian citizens so that they\u2019re brought up \u201ccorrectly\u201d.\n\nStrongmen, militias, and even organized gangs are then placed in charge of \u201cliberated\u201d areas. This was very well documented in the Donbas by personalities like Motorola, Givi, Pushilin and Pasechnik.\n\nIt\u2019s why the more ground Russia takes, the harder it will be to retake by the Ukrainians, even ignoring the tactical, operational, and strategic needs to do so.
