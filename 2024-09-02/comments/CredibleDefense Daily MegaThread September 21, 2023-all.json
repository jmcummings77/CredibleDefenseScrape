Unless you intentionally want to prolong the war, there is no reason to slowly increase these deliveries instead of doing ALL of them in June 2022.</p>\n</div>",

Of course they will, even more so than the present day Russian regime. It'll be a source of legitimacy.  \nWhy would they sell it, when Russia won't now? What's the motivation?

You're listing a bunch of \"concerns\" which are just presumed realistic because \"muh nukes\".\n\nThe concern is very simple - Russian nuclear weapons are geographically distributed by obvious necessity. If the Russian state collapses / fragments, each of these nuclear (not to mention chemical, biological, and even conventional) facilities becomes a security risk. I happen to believe that post-Russia states would pose *far* more of a challenge than non-state actors, but again, the risks are real. Sure, you can argue that this is an assumption - which is true, almost all geopolitical analysis rests on assumption, this isn't an argument it's a banal statement - but frankly, you don't matter. You have no credibility as your *belief* about what is a risk and what isn't is ill-informed. We observe that states take these risks seriously, and thus we *have* to intuit that these risks are real and enduring. \n\nYes, this is an assumption (and one that is often wrong!).\n\n>It is if the security concerns you're talking about are mere figments of imagination. Assumptions not based in reality.\n\nNations fragmenting or collapsing pose security risks. This is *well documented* in the existing literature, and has been a consistent feature of security discussions in the 21st century. If you want to argue otherwise, go publish a paper on it. \n\n>Did nukes go awry en masse when the Soviet Union fell? No. They didn't. And so we already have a very relevant example already.\n\nThe post-soviet union status of nuclear, chemical, and biological agents was one of extreme concern that all nations took very seriously. Ellesberg wrote a few pieces on this that are worth reading, but the crux of it is that the Russian state inherited the nuclear control apparatus of the Soviet Union and *immediately* used it (with American cooperation and assistance) to secure nuclear weapons facilities across the former USSR - in essence, the Russian state bureaucracy functioned as a kind of nuclear safety net. The collapse of the USSR is extremely unique, given the *core* of the empire remained *relatively* intact while the periphery essentially crumbled (weakening the core itself, of course, as they could no longer extract from periphery states). Such a thing is *unlikely* to exist if the Russian state collapses. \n\nIt's also worth noting the fall of the Soviet Union resulted in a significant proliferation of arms throughout the region so your point betrays an ignorance of history unfortunately. \n\n>Take this challenge for what it is, a call for reflection. What are you really basing these \"security concerns\" on? Are you sure you're not just making assumptions? That's for all of you.\n\nYour \"challenge\" is little more than childishly sticking your fingers in your ears and saying \"you're making it up!\" I don't believe you!\"",

Last summer, the Antonovsky Bridge near Kherson got absolutely hammered. It did a decent bit of damage that probably hindered transit across it.

Additionally, there will be a major threat of foreign object debris, basically anything that can be sucked into a turbine engine and damage it.

It has light landing gear because they deliberately cut weight for better thrust to weight ratio (faster, more power). And the engine intake is low in the center line, only a few feet from the ground, and huge, so there is a big threat of FOD. To put it in perspective, normal flight operations have much of the junior enlisted ground personnel getting on line and walk the airfield looking downwards and policing up anything that could possibly get sucked into an engine, [like this](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Dec/31/2002076408/1088/820/0/181222-F-PJ289-0091C.JPG).\n\nTechnically, the Ukrainians can make F16s work by building dedicated airfields. Lots of them. And each airfield needs scores of hardened hangers, to store aircraft and other equipment, so many it's impossible for the Russians and limited bunker buster long range weapons to take them all out, and have each airfield have many runways that it's hard to crater them all.

To put it in perspective, normal flight operations have much of the junior enlisted ground personnel getting on line and walk the airfield looking downwards and policing up anything that could possibly get sucked into an engine, <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2018/Dec/31/2002076408/1088/820/0/181222-F-PJ289-0091C.JPG\">like this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Technically, the Ukrainians can make F16s work by building dedicated airfields. Lots of them. And each airfield needs scores of hardened hangers, to store aircraft and other equipment, so many it&#39;s impossible for the Russians and limited bunker buster long range weapons to take them all out, and have each airfield have many runways that it&#39;s hard to crater them all. But that&#39;s a major construction effort, it&#39;ll take many years to do that.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "This to a T.\n\nHitting bridges (and infrastrucutre in general) is much easier said than done. Let me elaborate:\n\n1. Bridges are sturdy, dams even more so. If this war has taught us anything it is that it takes quite a bit to take out a bridge temporarily, let alone fully destroy it. All significant damage that has been done to major crossings (the K trio of Kerch, Kherson and Khakhovka) has required a land element in close proximity. The effectiveness of air and artillery strikes is limited and very far from able to destroy a crossing. Destroying a bridge would be important in this scenario as all bridges and dams are far behind frontlines, meaning that damage needs to be permanent to be effective, lest it be repaired.\n\n2. There's a lot of bridges and dams. Between Kyiv and Dnipro (city) there's another five hydroelectric stations as well more than a dozen bridges of importance. Taking one, two or three out is really not all that strategically important. \n\n3. Ukraine has quite a bit of layered air defence. Between Iris-Ts, Patriot and S-300, Ukraine has a decent amount of AM/AA coverage. Importantly, it's pretty much guaranteed that some of these resources will be close to the bridges that would need to be attacked, as coverage over cities like Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia is very likely. \n\n4. Russia's stockpiles of precision weaponry are low. This is both a qualititative and quantitative point. Bridges are hard to hit so you will need a very high degree of precision, down to the meter, to be really effective. The amount of missiles is also an issue. The steadily decreasing rate at which Russia uses its missiles points to there being limited stock available. Using dozens, if not hundreds, of missiles to attempt the destruction of a few bridges might potentially not be an effective use of limited resources.\n\n5. Destroying a hydroelectric plant is a war crime. Yes, this hasn't stopped them before, but the consequences of targeting the plants further up the Dnipro could be significantly more catastrophic in terms of human lives. E.g. the Kamianske Hydro Plant sits right before both Kamianske (200k) and Dnipro (1m). Large disasters like that are likely to lead to some sort of reaction from third parties. \n\nAdd all of these factors together and you would need to put very significant resources in play for a limited chance of success. Realistically, short of dropping two dozen nuclear warheads (and even then, it's debatable how effective a nuclear weapon is against a dam), Russia's chances of damaging enough crossings to make any difference is very limited.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This to a T.</p>\n\n<p>Hitting bridges (and infrastrucutre in general) is much easier said than done. Let me elaborate:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Bridges are sturdy, dams even more so. If this war has taught us anything it is that it takes quite a bit to take out a bridge temporarily, let alone fully destroy it. All significant damage that has been done to major crossings (the K trio of Kerch, Kherson and Khakhovka) has required a land element in close proximity. The effectiveness of air and artillery strikes is limited and very far from able to destroy a crossing. Destroying a bridge would be important in this scenario as all bridges and dams are far behind frontlines, meaning that damage needs to be permanent to be effective, lest it be repaired.</p></li>\n<li><p>There&#39;s a lot of bridges and dams. Between Kyiv and Dnipro (city) there&#39;s another five hydroelectric stations as well more than a dozen bridges of importance. Taking one, two or three out is really not all that strategically important. </p></li>\n<li><p>Ukraine has quite a bit of layered air defence. Between Iris-Ts, Patriot and S-300, Ukraine has a decent amount of AM/AA coverage. Importantly, it&#39;s pretty much guaranteed that some of these resources will be close to the bridges that would need to be attacked, as coverage over cities like Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia is very likely. </p></li>\n<li><p>Russia&#39;s stockpiles of precision weaponry are low. This is both a qualititative and quantitative point. Bridges are hard to hit so you will need a very high degree of precision, down to the meter, to be really effective. The amount of missiles is also an issue. The steadily decreasing rate at which Russia uses its missiles points to there being limited stock available. Using dozens, if not hundreds, of missiles to attempt the destruction of a few bridges might potentially not be an effective use of limited resources.</p></li>\n<li><p>Destroying a hydroelectric plant is a war crime.

Xi\u2019s mysterious purge of his foreign minister in July, followed by the reported ouster of his defense chief less than two months later, is making China appear unstable to the outside world. The Chinese leader also overhauled the generals overseeing China\u2019s Rocket Force, which manages the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, without giving an explanation.\n\n>And those are just the firings that have been made public.\n\n>While most analysts don\u2019t see any threat to Xi, who has amassed more power than any leader since Mao Zedong, questions are being raised about his management style. Morale within the Foreign Ministry in particular is very low, with anxiety running high among a group of bureaucrats that see themselves as professional diplomats who don\u2019t want to get caught up in political power plays, according to Chinese officials who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive information.\n\n>China hasn\u2019t seen such an intense period of high-profile purges since the reform era of the 1980s, exposing the \u201copacity and brutality\u201d of Xi\u2019s system, according to Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney who wrote The Party: The Secret World of China\u2019s Communist Rulers.\n\n>\u201cThese men were handpicked by Xi himself for promotion,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cSo their fall reflects on him.\u201d\n\n>The upheaval is leaving investors and governments spooked, as outsiders try to piece together Xi\u2019s motives from a slim trail of clues. It\u2019s also undercutting Beijing\u2019s efforts to convince the private sector it\u2019s safe to invest in China, after years of bruising crackdowns on sectors including tech and education. Health-care tycoons have lost some $17 billion in Xi\u2019s latest sweeping anti-graft campaign.\n\n>\u201cInternational overtures are overshadowed by the renewed purges,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics, a London-based research firm focused on China. \u201cInvestors are worried palace politics are keeping Xi away from addressing China\u2019s pressing economic problems.\u201d\n\n>>$188 Billion Exodus\n\n>Western firms in China are now the gloomiest they\u2019ve been about the future in decades, largely due to geopolitical risks, according to a recent American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai survey. Persistent tensions with the West \u2014 coupled with China\u2019s economic slowdown \u2014 have sparked a $188 billion exodus from Chinese stocks and bonds from a December-2021 peak through the end of June this year, diminishing the market\u2019s clout in global portfolios.\n\n>\u201cInvestor confidence requires systemic stability,\u201d said Brock Silvers, Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital. \u201cSudden, unexplained personnel or policy changes only exacerbate growing market concern.\u201d\n\n>Xi\u2019s shift in behavior isn\u2019t limited to his newfound hire-and-fire governing style: He\u2019s also increasingly focused on security and is staying home much more than previously. In May, he led a meeting that declared the need for \u201cextreme-scenario thinking\u201d on national security while ramping up a push for self-sufficiency in advanced tech as the US tightened restrictions in a bid to stay ahead of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\n>Xi has left China for only six days this year even after the nation opened up after the pandemic, and skipped the Group of 20 summit this month for the first time since he took power in 2012. When he attended a leaders\u2019 summit in South Africa last month, he didn\u2019t show up for a scheduled speech, getting his commerce minister to read his words instead. Chinese-language media reported that Xi made the address.\n\n>At that event, Xi\u2019s security team swept his South African hotel so thoroughly it even took local police by surprise. The Chinese flew in their own beds, curtains and carpets on a cargo plane, South African Police Minister Bheki Cele told local media. \u201cThere was nothing from South Africa in those rooms,\u201d he added.\n\n>That hyper-vigilance came after Xi stunned the world by removing Qin Gang as foreign minster after just seven months, the shortest amount of time anyone has spent in that post. An investigation found that Qin had an affair while serving as China\u2019s ambassador in Washington that could have endangered national security, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. The party\u2019s senior ranks are now being scrutinized for their dealings with foreigners, insiders told the WSJ, adding that the top brass in China\u2019s military were also under the spotlight.\n\n>As Xi\u2019s mistrust of his officials grows, the system is showing signs of becoming paralyzed as he tries to micromanage domestic operations. One foreign executive in Beijing, who asked not to be identified, said Chinese officials now operate in \u201csilos of fear,\u201d with everyone scared of Xi and also isolated from each other.\n\n>>Purging Political Rivals\n\n>Xi is no stranger to sacking high-level officials. In his first term he put ex-Politburo member Bo Xilai and former security czar Zhou Yongkang on trial. Those moves were part of a well-understood play to purge political rivals, and took down officials who had risen through the ranks under Xi\u2019s predecessors.\n\n>The recent casualties shot to power after Xi last year threw out party protocol on norms such as de facto retirement ages. For example, Qin \u2014 the former foreign minister \u2014 leapfrogged several older and more conventionally qualified peers.\n\n>US officials have intelligence that Defense Minister Li Shangfu has already been removed from his post. China hasn\u2019t officially commented on his status, but in July authorities announced a retrospective probe into the military equipment procurement department he once led, for a date range overlapping with the former aerospace engineer\u2019s tenure.\n\n>\u201cIt shows a deficiency in the vetting process,\u201d Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Center for China Analysis, told Bloomberg TV, adding that Xi appears to have skipped the stringent checks and factional haggling that accompanied Communist Party promotions in previous decades.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good look to have a couple of your handpicked generals or foreign minister taken out so early,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut Xi\u2019s base of power is not winning popularity contests in elections. It\u2019s controlling these key levers at the top.\u201d",

            "body": "As much as I don't like Zelensky's government and feel ashamed about the amounts of stupid things all the politics or diplomats that him and his party appointed say (both internally and on the international level), I just wanna say something. The amount of people that think that Ukraine is ungrateful or whatever and the logic behind it is just baffling. \n\nIt's pretty clear that most of the help Ukraine gets doesn't come from the good heart, it's all politics. Whether the reason is containing Russian military far from NATO or just to appear charitable to their electorate, there are not that many powerful people that genuinely care about some country at the far end of progressive Europe that they couldn't even tell from Russia 10 years ago. \n\nUkraine does what it has to do to save the country, clearly their goal priority in this war is not correspondent to that of their allies (Get back the territories stolen for Ukraine and \"don't piss of Russia too much\" for most of their allies). If simply begging doesn't work, obviously you have to try something different, so Zelensky tries to push the allies all the time, sometimes walking over this very thin line. Ukraine and their allies live in very different realities. For Ukraine the danger is immediate and the goals are clear. For the allies the danger is only there if Russia is poked too hard (or whatever they think) and that makes their goals a bit blurred. \n\nI don't get this discourse about \"gratitude\" and \"the hand that feeds\" at all. We're not in the kindergarten, every action here has a purpose. If you think that Ukraine has to be silent and only say \"thank you\", well, that's pretty much what Russian propaganda have always painted this pro-Western life to Ukrainians (and Russians) since 2013. There's obviously gonna be some disagreements, Ukraine cares about Ukraine, EU cares about EU, Poland cares about Poland. As far as I'm concerned, that's because Ukraine isn't their allies' vassal because of their help. They're just allies, HENCE the help. \n\nI imagine if they withdraw the help, Ukraine will be slowly and painfully dying and Zelensky will be twice as loud, and that cry will be used by opposing parties of allied countries just as much as they do the opposing thing now, because politics. And in the end Ukraine will end up pro-Russian with all the resentment now turned to the West, so you get that kind of country just under NATO borders in the end. So what's dumber thing to do in the end? Zelensky not being careful with his mouth when his country is desperate or actually withdrawing the aid because of that? Zelensky bets the latter, hence he thinks he can slip in some criticism in his speeches. We'll see how it works out in the end for him, but it does makes some sense if you think about it from Ukraine's point. \n\nBut that's speaking in general about the \"ungrateful\" comments. The funniest thing is that a lot of people jumped into this discussion because of Ukraine-Poland bickering, while not even understanding the context of it, e.g. Polish elections, the importance of agriculture for Ukraine - the country that has her economics wiped out, the fact that Polish-Ukrainian relationship has been this way pretty much all the time before the war and that this kind of quarrel isn't anything new. Personally, I think that if Poland keeps this rhetoric after elections, then it may be the time to start being worried, for now it's all just traditional strongman populism from PiS. Zelensky, on the other hand, doesn't need that populism for now (EU ban on UA grain has been active for a long time and not a lot of Ukrainians even knew about it), so if he picked this fight, it's pretty important. \n\nWith all that said, Zelensky and his party are real wildcards sometimes, I've been saying this since the start of the war. It won't be surprising if it does blow up in his face, as many things already did. And I think those things that did worth being discussed much more than how grateful or ungrateful he was in his speeches. Read what u/Duncan-M wrote in this very thread about Zelensky's inability to play by the rules. That's pretty much exactly how Putin viewed him and had played a role in the way and the timing of this war. Also this very quality is what got him his elections win - a promise of an outsider jumping into \"the game\", so that's just what he is. \n\nSorry, that was rather extensive rant, I'm just disappointed in the way this topic blew up and tired of reading the people turn negative on Ukraine because of that. But hey, I'm as biased as you can get, so feel free to school me on this one.",

For the allies the danger is only there if Russia is poked too hard (or whatever they think) and that makes their goals a bit blurred. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t get this discourse about &quot;gratitude&quot; and &quot;the hand that feeds&quot; at all. We&#39;re not in the kindergarten, every action here has a purpose. If you think that Ukraine has to be silent and only say &quot;thank you&quot;, well, that&#39;s pretty much what Russian propaganda have always painted this pro-Western life to Ukrainians (and Russians) since 2013. There&#39;s obviously gonna be some disagreements, Ukraine cares about Ukraine, EU cares about EU, Poland cares about Poland. As far as I&#39;m concerned, that&#39;s because Ukraine isn&#39;t their allies&#39; vassal because of their help. They&#39;re just allies, HENCE the help. </p>\n\n<p>I imagine if they withdraw the help, Ukraine will be slowly and painfully dying and Zelensky will be twice as loud, and that cry will be used by opposing parties of allied countries just as much as they do the opposing thing now, because politics. And in the end Ukraine will end up pro-Russian with all the resentment now turned to the West, so you get that kind of country just under NATO borders in the end. So what&#39;s dumber thing to do in the end? Zelensky not being careful with his mouth when his country is desperate or actually withdrawing the aid because of that? Zelensky bets the latter, hence he thinks he can slip in some criticism in his speeches. We&#39;ll see how it works out in the end for him, but it does makes some sense if you think about it from Ukraine&#39;s point. </p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s speaking in general about the &quot;ungrateful&quot; comments. The funniest thing is that a lot of people jumped into this discussion because of Ukraine-Poland bickering, while not even understanding the context of it, e.g. Polish elections, the importance of agriculture for Ukraine - the country that has her economics wiped out, the fact that Polish-Ukrainian relationship has been this way pretty much all the time before the war and that this kind of quarrel isn&#39;t anything new. Personally, I think that if Poland keeps this rhetoric after elections, then it may be the time to start being worried, for now it&#39;s all just traditional strongman populism from PiS. Zelensky, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t need that populism for now (EU ban on UA grain has been active for a long time and not a lot of Ukrainians even knew about it), so if he picked this fight, it&#39;s pretty important. </p>\n\n<p>With all that said, Zelensky and his party are real wildcards sometimes, I&#39;ve been saying this since the start of the war. It won&#39;t be surprising if it does blow up in his face, as many things already did. And I think those things that did worth being discussed much more than how grateful or ungrateful he was in his speeches. Read what <a href=\"/u/Duncan-M\">u/Duncan-M</a> wrote in this very thread about Zelensky&#39;s inability to play by the rules. That&#39;s pretty much exactly how Putin viewed him and had played a role in the way and the timing of this war. Also this very quality is what got him his elections win - a promise of an outsider jumping into &quot;the game&quot;, so that&#39;s just what he is. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry, that was rather extensive rant, I&#39;m just disappointed in the way this topic blew up and tired of reading the people turn negative on Ukraine because of that. But hey, I&#39;m as biased as you can get, so feel free to school me on this one.</p>\n</div>",

And yet, I think most rational actors would agree that America should just suck it up and accept it as just something they have to deal with. That's sometimes the responsibility of stronger powers, especially when they are the ones not getting their countries bombed to shit.\n\nI mean, look at the French during World War II. Look at Charles de Gaulle. It is not uncommon for people receiving massive aid to still be quite demanding towards the people who are aiding them. There is a logic to it.

Many would say yes, but so what? </p>\n\n<p>Commanders and others who controlled the military legal system said otherwise and didn&#39;t charge them. And that at the end of the day is how legal systems work. That was a precedent. Unless someone successfully charges them and charges it, that&#39;s that. </p>\n\n<p>What matters more for perception is how these killings influence the war. Will Russians be more or less hesitant to surrender if they don&#39;t think it&#39;ll do any good? Because that can have major repercussions. You don&#39;t want to give the enemy propaganda to use again you.</p>\n\n<p>Why the hell would some idiot release this footage? This is why the delete button exists...</p>\n</div>",

Probably only two air forces in the world could accomplish it, the US and Israel, and only because both spent most of a century practicing it and dumping TONS of funding to accomplish it. \n\nThe VKS was never trained to do it, isn't organized to do it, doesn't possess the systems to do it, and definitely doesn't have a clue how. They predominantly fly single or two aircraft sorties, to accomplish a major DEAD campaign would involve wing sized, highly coordinated strike packages. \n\nTo start off, the VKS needs to find and destroy their biggest threat, a bunch of Patriot and S-300 systems, who have long range capabilities and better radars. At a minimum taking out their radars but also trying to get the missiles too. Part of that could be done with long range missiles, of which the Russians are now low (especially the better ballistic missiles), but other parts would need to be done by fixed wing aircraft. Some would need anti-radiation missiles (that aren't very good from what I've read) while others are doing EW jamming, much of which won't be as effective a year and a half into the war as they used to be. Not to mention causing fratricide issues, jamming their own side.\n\nBut that's just one piece of the UAF integrated air defense network they need to go after. The Russians also need to push forward with their own fighter aircraft to take out the Ukrainian Air Force combat air patrols, who are flying low and fast, which requires the Russians to go deeper into Ukrainian airspace to find them with their fighter radars to get a lock, fire and guarantee they get them. If even a few a missed it can totally screw things up. They're operating from dispersed airfields so destroying them in the air is the only reliable way to get them, which requires a permanent Russian combat air patrol over Ukrainian air space to keep them grounded. \n\nBut if all Ukrainian ground based air defenses aren't suppressed or destroyed, the Russians would get HAMMERED trying that. On top of  Ukrainians also have plenty of medium (NASSAM, Buk, etc) and short range air defenses, plus MANPADS too. \n\nMore so, the Russians can only track Ukrainian GBAD if their radars are on. At this point, their IADS likely has some on and some off, with those off using \"pop up tactics\", momentarily turning on to track and engage only when they know an enemy is in range, then turning off and displacing after. So that would also make the Russian fighter CAP trying to get air superiority vulnerable. Which means they need dedicated SEAD/DEAD support flying with them doing wild weasel type flights attached to their strike package, which the Russians don't do. \n\nPlus, how do any these aircraft refuel? They barely have any tankers. How do they find out what's in front of them without more and better AWAC?\n\nAnd they wouldn't even have surprise doing this. Even if they managed to have the OPSEC so HUMINT or SIGINT didn't pick up the operation in the planning stage, as soon as it launched the NATO AWACS flying over Romanian or the Black Sea would spot it all and give an instant warning to Ukraine (similarly to how all the Russian major long range PGM raids are spotted beforehand). \n\n>Also their touted air defense seems to be so lacking considering how much hits they\u2019re taking at military bases and other command structures. The fact that Ukraine is able to launch a drone at Moscow (even hitting the Kremlin?) in wartime seems ridiculous to me.\n\nIt's about where the GBAD is and what level of alert they are on. For example, good luck flying a commercial airline into a major Ukrainian city, because they don't screw around. But Moscow isn't prepped similarly, they weren't stacking it with GBAD that are crewed at high alert, running active radar and ready to shoot down anything not identified in advance as friendly. Same goes for Crimea and areas of Russia closer to Ukraine. \n\nWhy would they mass GBAD there in advance just in case the Ukrainians eventually come up with a long range drone? Where do the GBAD come from? Should they pull them from the Donbas? Zaporizhzhia? \n\nBecause on the flip side, that's why the Russians are able to use fixed wing strike and attack helicopters on the front lines so much, because the Ukrainians have made the decision to mass their GBAD over cities, key communication areas, and other rear areas. If the Ukrainians wanted to seriously put a hurt on the KA-52 they could, but then they would leave the rear areas vulnerable, which they aren't willing to do. \n\nMeanwhile, with repeated strikes against their rear areas the Russians have to now make a difficult choice about their air defense priorities.",
