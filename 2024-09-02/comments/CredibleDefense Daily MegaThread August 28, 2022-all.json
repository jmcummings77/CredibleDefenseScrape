The past few weeks haven't seemed to result in any significant exchanges while Ukrainian attacks on Russian military targets and gloc in the south continue.\n\nTalk of counter offensive(s) has tapered off as the focus is clearly on degrading the force, rather than ramping up for offensive maneuvers. Hell, even the talk of political developments like the much anticipated referendums now looks premature, as setbacks have arisen. So I'm curious about next steps, however far out they may be.\n\nHow long do you expect this lull in fighting to persist? What developments are you looking out for to indicate that the next phase of this war is imminent? Assuming any eventual Ukrainian counter offensive will be in Zaporizhzhia or Kherson, what are prevailing weather conditions on the steppe Sept. - onwards? At what point/will they become a major factor (Rasputitsa etc)?\n\nBasically I'm in search of a primer for the next few months. Thanks in advance.",

Like any kind of sanction, it will seriously inconvenience a lot of people and businesses that don\u2019t support, or indeed have anything to do with the war. That is the nature of sanctions.  \n\nThe question is if it will be effective.  My opinion is that currently Putin enjoys widespread support because of a bargain he has made with the Russian people. You do what I say, and ignore politics, and I will supply plenty if consumer goods. It won\u2019t be like the 90\u2019s. There will be plenty of food in the supermarket, goods on the shelves, high end electronics, plenty of entertainment, the whole bread and circuses. This is the deal. The upper class Russian - not just the uber-wealthy 1%, but all upper class Russians - have benefitted from this.  They see that their lives are getting materially better, and they support Putin because of it. They don\u2019t care if boys from Buryatia are dying. They don\u2019t care that Ukrainian civilians are being killed. They think Putin is good for Russia because their lives are getting better.  We can\u2019t ban food.  We can\u2019t prevent China from sending Russia whatever tech they want.  But we can prevent upper class Russians from vacationing in Europe, and that is going to piss them off mightily.  And Putin *does not want* the Moscow-StP elite to be angry.  So, it seems to me that it is something that can be done, that will have an effect, and harms nothing, because I really don\u2019t care about the tears of someone angry that they can\u2019t vacation abroad.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a political discussion sub, so I am going to leave it there, thanks for the conversation.",

That is the nature of sanctions.  </p>\n\n<p>The question is if it will be effective.  My opinion is that currently Putin enjoys widespread support because of a bargain he has made with the Russian people. You do what I say, and ignore politics, and I will supply plenty if consumer goods. It won\u2019t be like the 90\u2019s. There will be plenty of food in the supermarket, goods on the shelves, high end electronics, plenty of entertainment, the whole bread and circuses. This is the deal. The upper class Russian - not just the uber-wealthy 1%, but all upper class Russians - have benefitted from this.  They see that their lives are getting materially better, and they support Putin because of it. They don\u2019t care if boys from Buryatia are dying. They don\u2019t care that Ukrainian civilians are being killed. They think Putin is good for Russia because their lives are getting better.  We can\u2019t ban food.  We can\u2019t prevent China from sending Russia whatever tech they want.  But we can prevent upper class Russians from vacationing in Europe, and that is going to piss them off mightily.  And Putin <em>does not want</em> the Moscow-StP elite to be angry.  So, it seems to me that it is something that can be done, that will have an effect, and harms nothing, because I really don\u2019t care about the tears of someone angry that they can\u2019t vacation abroad.  </p>\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a political discussion sub, so I am going to leave it there, thanks for the conversation.</p>\n</div>",

It's god damn Russia we're talking about, most people know what it means to be prepared for winter there. I understand looking at the past makes us question Russia's ability to cope with every single teeny or larger issue but Russians are not dumb even though clearly (luckily-unluckily) incompetent, they were probably the first to know before the Ukrainians that they'd be stuck in a trench warfare amidst winter because they lacked everything to commit to a successful offensive.

That's hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of people stuck in trenches that require nice winter clothing as well. NATO could supply a lot of them, it should be the least of the worries given the steady supply of personal equipment but that doesn't mean it's not going to be difficult, that's a LOT of legs and torsos to insulate, in what is an infantry-heavy army. \n\nIf it's a deep freeze we can see some limited offensives here or there, I have seen someone here mentioning Russian doctrine actually relies on winter in some sense for maneuvers (haven't checked myself) and it might be more feasible to continue offensive actions once greenery has subsided, especially when the enemy just can't stay in the cold trenches for weeks and morale might plummet in many areas as a result. \n\nAlso speaking of winter won't IR seekers be more effective when helicopters are just one big orange blob?",

Or we&#39;ll be finding layers upon layers of clothes on them looking like Michelline. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian TDF is going to be a tough nut to crack supply-wise. That&#39;s hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of people stuck in trenches that require nice winter clothing as well. NATO could supply a lot of them, it should be the least of the worries given the steady supply of personal equipment but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not going to be difficult, that&#39;s a LOT of legs and torsos to insulate, in what is an infantry-heavy army. </p>\n\n<p>If it&#39;s a deep freeze we can see some limited offensives here or there, I have seen someone here mentioning Russian doctrine actually relies on winter in some sense for maneuvers (haven&#39;t checked myself) and it might be more feasible to continue offensive actions once greenery has subsided, especially when the enemy just can&#39;t stay in the cold trenches for weeks and morale might plummet in many areas as a result. </p>\n\n<p>Also speaking of winter won&#39;t IR seekers be more effective when helicopters are just one big orange blob?</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I missed the discussion in the previous thread on how European elections will stop support for Ukraine in face of recession. I find it pretty hilarious, but majority of you seem reasonable so I might as well share what is most likely going to happen.\n\n1. Russia's aggression will become a scapegoat for EU disastrous energy failures, ECB's dogshit monetary policy and fiscal issues that have been ongoing since 2008 financial crisis.\n2. Every-single-issue will be blamed on Putin's war & energy blackmail. Any populist (or opposition party) calling for talks will Russia be bombarded with images of Bucha's war crimes and pictures of dead children from shelled Ukrainian cities. Alternatively, quotes of Russians threatening using nukes against European states will be thrown at them whenever possible.\n3. International Criminal Court investigation looking into Russian war crimes will be ongoing and brutal facts will be disclosed & discussed every now and then.\n4. Inflation caused by Covid supply chain disruptions and excessive stimulus will be called 'Putin's inflation' (already happening) and public discontent will be successfully deflected towards Russia which is just part of the problem.\n5. EU politicians will be free to finally pursue nuclear energy and do unrestricted business with regimes in Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Saudis, Nigeria, Congo, Qatar etc or pay the premium for Canadian/American/Australian LNG. Undemocratic/corrupted regimes don't start war in Europe and threaten EU stability hence there won't be a public backlash anymore. Concurrently, EU might as well finally start fracking which has been a taboo thus far.\n6. 2% GDP defence spending will be no longer a political issue but a necessity.
