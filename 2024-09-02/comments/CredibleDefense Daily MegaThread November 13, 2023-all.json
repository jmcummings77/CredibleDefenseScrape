As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

On paper a drone is cake for a Gepard. But the software on them was likely calibrated to ignore a lot of false positives that aren't jets and that may mean quad copters get excluded by default too.

As of now, the fighting is for the most part limited to the border areas where military control has always been tenuous at best. While the military setbacks in recent days are significant, the coastal cities are not under threat (yet) and one of the few factors which holds true for all the rebels is that they have very little heavy equipment. Their ability to continue making gains when they aren't on their home turf is questionable. A comprehensive victory for the junta seems off the cards, but I have a hard time seeing a rebel path to complete victory. The only certainty I'd bet on is that chaos will increase.\n\n> Will the humanitarian cost of the war be moderate or gigantic?\n\nModerate, for a pleasant surprise. At least by modern standards. Hopefully. The thing about Myanmar is that everyone is really really poor. The rebels have little more than small arms, whereas the junta fields a small but decisive set of armored/air assets. But nobody has the firepower to really level cities like Israel is doing. There is also lots of geographic room, relatively speaking, for civilians to flee. Again, it's no Gaza. \n\n> If the rebels win, what kind of government and policies will they institute?\n\nWho are the rebels? Again, this comes back to the fact that the \"rebels\" are not at all unified. In theory, there is a shadow government called the NUG which theoretically wants to establish some kind of federal democratic system. In practice, most of the men with guns are not actually listening to it, or anyone else who isn't holding a bigger gun. In history, such dynamics tend to not turn out very well. Things are made more complicated by the ethnic factors at work in Myanmar, which has historically been dominated by the Bamar majority. The previous NLD government was Bamar-led and so was the military which previously served it. That is no longer the case now, obviously, and many of the minorities see this civil war (which is not so much civil for them as simply a war) as a historic chance to lock in bigger pieces of the pie for themselves. They'll probably succeed. How violently they will succeed, well, that's a different question. But you should probably asking whether there will be a national government which can enact policies across the entire nation, as opposed to having multiple functionally independent enclaves paying lip service to the capital. Frankly, I'd sooner bet on the latter than the former. But again, all of this is highly uncertain and changing by the day. Nobody knows how it will all end up.",

Please educate yourself some more before aggressively calling out valuable and knowledgeable contributors here. \n\nThe NUG exists in 2 ways. The first is as a government-in-exile comprising basically NLD members and their affiliates (the ones who aren't in prison). Governments-in-exile by definition don't govern: the NUG only formed after they all had to flee the coup - it doesn't make sense that they would be much more than a symbol within Burma. The NUG is only exists in Burma as a way of *describing* (a) Bamar PDF political desires for return to representative government, and (b) inter-group communication in general among the PDFs and between PDFs and EAOs. And speaking of inter-group communication which NUG claims credit for, it's worth noting that cooperation amongst PDFs and between PDFs and EAOs even now is pretty limited and not where people hoped it would be a year ago. The characterization of \"65,000 PDF members under NUG control\" is misleading (to put it lightly). Meanwhile, we have seen an incredibly high degree of coordination and communication amongst the EAOs, but this communication has nothing to do with NUG (most of these groups predate the NLD).\n\nThe second way NUG exists is hypothetical and rhetorical. **The most important things to realize are** (1) that the EAOs are pretty much the entire military muscle behind the resistance, and (2) that the EAOs are all nationalist separatists who have been fighting the state for generations. They would *never* willingly yoke themselves to a Bamar government. They know that without them, the NUG and the PDFs would be completely DOA. A humiliated Tatmadaw + a Bamar government that literally owes them its existence is an ideal setup for them. Claiming NUG affiliation also offers them a degree of international legitimacy they would never have otherwise.

                        "body": "Sorry that I missed your question yesterday. I don't spend all my time obsessing over this thread or every easily offended idiot here. My main sources are friends living in Yangon and Kunmeng, who send me Burmese/Chinese content which most people here can't understand. But for something so obvious as NUG powerlessness, there are plenty of credible English-language sources. It's a very well known problem. \n\n[The NUG talks a big game, but it doesn't match the reality on the ground.](https://asiatimes.com/2023/04/myanmars-resistance-needs-a-zelensky-like-charismatic-leader/)\n\n> \u201cThere is no single charismatic leader that can represent the opposition because there is no unified opposition,\u201d Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said. \u201cThe National Unity Government claims to speak for all opposition forces, but it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cThe ethnic armed organizations or the more important fighting forces, without which the NUG has no hope of victory, are not interested in following the NUG\u2019s political lead.\u201d\n\n[The NUG does not hold any territory of its own.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/closing-window-problem-facing-myanmars-pro-democracy-forces)\n\n> Because the National Unity Government lacks territory of its own, it is fundamentally dependent upon the ethnic armed groups, and, without them, the balance of power would become lopsided in favor of the junta. Moreover, while the ethnic armed organizations have long held base areas\u2014and continue to deepen and expand their governance of them\u2014the National Unity Government lacks its own, rendering it fundamentally insecure and dependent upon them. \n\n> Beyond its exposed centers of gravity, the National Unity Government\u2019s larger \u201croving rebel\u201d problem is the risk of irrelevancy in the absence of the governing legitimacy that taking and holding territory would bring. Troubling parallels are evident with the Syrian political opposition that emerged to challenge Bashar Al-Assad in 2011. Similarities include a wide-ranging and fragile coalition, the proliferation of numerous local armed groups fighting autonomously, and the lack of a clear overarching strategy.\n\n> Territory would grant the resistance more time for a variety of reasons. For one, territory would reduce its reliance upon the largesse of allied ethnic armed organizations like the Kachin Independence Organization and the Karen National Union and grant the National Unity Government stronger leverage and viability to negotiate for closer political cooperation. The National Unity Government would have a stronger hand during political negotiations, as it would be less dependent and could bring more resources to the table. It could also more effectively persuade the fence-sitting groups that it is a viable contender for power in Naypyidaw.\n\n> Second, territory would serve as a base from which to consolidate command and control and mobilize for future strategic offensives. Currently, many People\u2019s Defense Forces lack armaments and those that acquire weapons often get them from the ethnic armed groups or rudimentary local workshops, not the National Unity Government. A territorial base would allow the National Unity Government to escalate nascent efforts to establish its own logistical supply chain, such as through 3D printing guns and local manufacturing of weapons. Controlling a more stable and independent supply of weapons to local armed fighters would make it substantially easier to assert command and control directives. A base area would also allow for more breathing room and space to consolidate units and resources to prepare for larger-scale offensives in the future.\n\n> Third, while demonstrating some capacity to govern, the National Unity Government has not demonstrated territorial viability. Insurgencies are fundamentally about controlling territory to contest state governance, but the National Unity Government has not yet done so on a significant scale. In many outlying areas, the ethnic armed organizations have established, deepened, and extended their own governance mechanisms, but largely in support of their own autonomy and interests. A \u201croving rebel\u201d National Unity Government remains vulnerable to accusations from international governments that its prospects for victory are not strong enough to justify open engagement. It also hinders its ability to provide humanitarian aid and services for Myanmar\u2019s people, as well as protect them from the junta\u2019s rapacious predation. Visibly governing territory effectively will show the people, the international community, and the ethnic armed groups that the National Unity Government is actively competing with the junta for control of the state apparatus.\n\n[The NUG exerts no actual authority in terms of operational control.](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/killings-11072023115759.html)\n\n> Maung Maung Swe, the deputy secretary of the NUG\u2019s ministry of defense, told RFA that the shadow government is \u201calready planning to resolve\u201d the killings in Mandalay and Sagaing regions. Maung Maung Swe said that while a code of conduct has been established for the country\u2019s PDF groups to follow, \u201cthere may still be disputes, due to the complexity of the situation on the ground,\u201d and he called for better oversight to minimize such incidents.\n\n> But a member of the PDF in Magway region told RFA that while the perpetrators of such crimes are supposedly arrested by local defense groups and \u201csentenced to prison by courts,\u201d the reality of law and order in post-coup Myanmar is that \u201cthere are no courts, prisons or lawyers to prosecute these cases.\u201d\n\n[The NUG is just a talk shop trying to gain support.](https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-opposition-riven-by-internal-divisions-/7271753.html) \n\n> Even supporters of the opposition National Unity Government \u2014 born out of the ousted National League for Democracy \u2014 complained in conversations with VOA that the armed wing of the NUG in Myanmar, known as the all-volunteer guerrilla People's Defense Force, lacks a single military command structure wedded to a coherent political policy and an unsullied leader. \"They basically control no territory on their own,\" he said, adding the ethnic armies see the NUG as a communications coordinating entity and as part of a broader coalition in the resistance, as opposed to the country\u2019s government-in-waiting.\n\n> When the NUG goes to the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development \"and speaks as if they are a government,\" Martin said, \"legitimately, the State Department says, \u2018OK, how are you going to do these things you say you are going to do.\u2019 And they don\u2019t have the resources to do it.\"\n\n[The NUG is simply not in charge of the men with the guns.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/15/myanmars-nug-negotiates-ethnic-differences-as-crisis-deepens)\n\n> \u201cThere is no way that the NUG can or will unite all armed groups against the Myanmar military. Different groups have different interests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NUG needs trustworthy alliances with militarily and politically formidable groups. Mainly, it needs to be able to form its own command structure out of the PDFs. As many of them don\u2019t want to be ordered about, and the NUG is not able to offer them much, if anything, by way of support, this is a difficult task.\u201d\n\nNow that we've established the difference between narratives and reality, let's take a look at why your sources are narratives, not reality. Your first source is an editorial arguing that international governments ought to recognize the NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar, and represents the NUG's authority as vastly greater than it actually is to support said argument. Your second source is a piece focused on the life of an NUG official lobbying in Washington, who has every incentive to talk up his own leverage in order to better secure international support. Your third source is actually quite good, as it is written by a local journalist and dives into the details of the NUG. Unfortunately for you, it doesn't say what you think it does. \n\n> To reiterate: the NUG is not a political party. It is a grouping of political forces with different ideologies who have gathered together to bring down a military dictatorship and establish a federal Union. It is a grouping of different ethnic and political groups that also have different interpretations of federalism. It comprises various groups that have taken up arms to implement their political objectives.\n\nWhich is precisely my point. The \"NUG\" is a facade. It is, at best, an umbrella coalition formed by individual leaders who each wield individual power but whose power bases do not share any broader loyalty and are not bound to any greater institution. At worst it is simply a label which each group takes up and discards at whim, as it suits their needs to pretend membership in a larger body. Each part of it acts on its own initiative to advance its own agenda and fulfill its own goals. It is in no way a centralized organization with a clear chain of command which exerts functional control over the day-to-day operations of its members. The NUG calls itself the National Unity Government, but it is neither national nor united nor a government. \n\nAnd since you clearly have neither knowledge of the situation on the ground nor sense enough to distinguish propaganda from reality, I'd recommend you spend a bit more time reading past the headlines to get a sense of what's actually happening in Myanmar.",

Mid-life RIM-7 updates would partially rework the engine to give a burst to get it off the ground before switching to the cruise burn, in addition to lighter and smaller avionics and sensors allowing a bigger rocket motor. The RIM-162 replaced the entire rocket motor (including adding a boost motor) section as well as more extensive reworks of fins, avionics, and sensors, giving it even longer range.</p>\n</div>",

There isn\u2019t too much \u2018new\u2019 in this article, especially since most of these findings were fairly well speculated on, but it\u2019s a coherent narrative of some of the more disparate threads that have been reported on individually. Some excerpts, but would encourage a full reading for those interested:\n\n\n> New evidence suggests that they were prepared to go even further. Some militants carried enough food, ammunition and equipment to last several days, officials said, and bore instructions to continue deeper into Israel if the first wave of attacks succeeded, potentially striking larger Israeli cities.\n\n> The assault teams managed to penetrate as far as Ofakim, an Israeli town about 15 miles from the Gaza Strip and about half the distance between the enclave and the West Bank. One unit carried reconnaissance information and maps suggesting an intention to continue the assault up to the border of the West Bank, according to two senior Middle Eastern intelligence officials and one former U.S. official with detailed knowledge of the evidence. Hamas had been increasing its outreach to West Bank militants in recent months, although the group says it did not notify its West Bank allies of its Oct. 7 plans in advance.\n\n>\u201cIf that had occurred, it would have been a huge propaganda win \u2014 a symbolic blow not only against Israel, but also against the Palestinian Authority,\u201d the government that exercises partial control in the West Bank, said the former U.S. official who was briefed on evidence collected since the Oct. 7 attack. The former official, like several others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss preliminary intelligence findings.\n\n> Hamas meticulously planned and prepared for a massacre of Israeli civilians on a scale that was highly likely to provoke Israel\u2019s government into sending troops into Gaza, analysts said. Indeed, Hamas leaders have publicly expressed a willingness to accept heavy losses \u2014 potentially including the deaths of many Gazan civilians living under Hamas rule.\n\n>\u201cWill we have to pay a price? Yes, and we are ready to pay it,\u201d Ghazi Hamad, a member of the Hamas politburo, told Beirut\u2019s LCBI television in an interview aired on Oct. 24. \u201cWe are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.\u201d\nHamas was willing to accept such sacrifices as the price for kick-starting a new wave of violent Palestinian resistance in the region and scuttling efforts at normalizing relations between Israel and Arab states, according to current and former intelligence officials and counterterrorism experts.\n\n> The planning for the historic assault against Israel was underway for well more than a year before the events of Oct. 7, intelligence officials say. Hamas officials took pains to conceal the preparations, even as senior leaders dropped occasional hints about their intentions.\n\n>Throughout the Gaza Strip \u2014 the densely populated, heavily surveilled seaside enclave roughly the size of Philadelphia \u2014 Hamas conducted above- and below-ground military exercises. Hamas fighters trained with imported AK-47 rifles, handguns, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and thermobaric projectiles that generate powerful pressure waves and intense fires with temperatures exceeding 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n>As they trained, they carefully scrutinized population centers and military bases to create a matrix of potential targets, Western and Middle Eastern intelligence officials said.\n\n>To obtain detailed intelligence, Hamas deployed cheap surveillance drones to generate maps of the Israeli towns and military installations within a few miles of the $1 billion barrier system that Israel built to wall off Gaza. The group elicited additional information, intelligence officials said, from Gazan day laborers who were permitted to enter Israel for work, often in the same farming communities that were in Hamas\u2019s crosshairs. It even monitored Israeli websites, studying real estate photographs and social media postings depicting life inside kibbutzim and the layouts of buildings and houses.\n\n>The intelligence gathering was not particularly sophisticated, but it was methodical, said Ali Soufan, a former FBI counterterrorism official and founder of the Soufan Group, a private New York security consultancy that works closely with Middle Eastern governments.\n\n> The plan\u2019s top architect, Israel believes, was Yehiya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s military leader. Formerly a Hamas detainee who spent two decades in Israeli prisons, Sinwar is fluent in Hebrew and a self-avowed student of Israeli political culture and news media. Armed with an unusually deep understanding of prevailing political currents in Israel, he and other Hamas leaders began issuing subtle signals in recent years hinting of a new pragmatism.\n\n>It was a message that Israelis wanted to hear \u2014 that \u201cHamas wants no more wars,\u201d said Michael Milshtein, the former chief of Palestinian affairs in Aman, Israel\u2019s military intelligence directorate. Milshtein, who briefly met Sinwar years ago, said that Oct. 7 bore an essential hallmark of Sinwar\u2019s previous operations: a \u201cknowledge of the basic consciousness of the Israeli public.\u201d\n\n>To buttress that perception of moderation, clashes between Hamas and Israel ceased after 2021. The group notably refrained from jumping in on several occasions when its Gaza ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or PIJ, fired rockets or engaged militarily with Israel. To many in Israel, it was further evidence that Hamas had changed and no longer sought a bloody conflict. Some reports suggested that Hamas officials even passed along intelligence about PIJ to the Israelis to reinforce the impression that they were being cooperative.\n\n> The relative calm on Israel\u2019s southwestern border was welcome, as Israeli officials were preoccupied with problems elsewhere. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government was threatened by historic domestic unrest, including unprecedented waves of demonstrations against his far-right administration\u2019s proposed judicial overhaul. Israel\u2019s military perceived a far greater security threat from Hezbollah in the north and from violent Palestinian groups engaged in escalating clashes with Israeli soldiers and armed settlers in the West Bank.\n\n> The contraband, transported in some cases by modified drones but also by truck, included assault rifles, pistols and silencers, Claymore-style antipersonnel mines and C-4 military explosives, the officials said.\n\n>The ultimate supplier of the weapons was unclear, but analysts said the goods crossed into Jordan with the aid of Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, two countries that share a border with the kingdom. How many weapons successfully reached the West Bank is unknown, they said. At least some of the drones were equipped with anti-jamming equipment that made it difficult to force the aircraft down, one of the officials said.\n\n>\u201cThis was not one network but multiple networks,\u201d the official said. \u201cMany of the attempts were foiled, and people were arrested. It was clear they were trying to use the same routes and methods as drug traffickers.\u201d\n\n> Some of most brutal attacks occurred in Beeri, where militants cut open the belly of a pregnant woman and dragged her fetus onto the ground. In other towns, survivors told of parents being murdered in front of their children and children murdered in front of their parents. \n\n>Other survivors described witnessing sexual assaults, including rape.\n\u201cWe know from interrogations that Hamas came in with detailed plans of their attack, including which commander should rape which soldiers in different places,\u201d Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told The Washington Post.\n\n> The findings confirmed the thoroughness of Hamas\u2019s intelligence-gathering efforts before the attacks. Some dead fighters had carried high-resolution maps, estimated to have been produced by drones as close as 150 feet above the ground, presumably in the summer, judging from the dryness of the vegetation in the images.\n\n>One assault team had been furnished with satellite-based maps, with markings showing the routes from Gaza\u2019s Shejaiya district to the nearest breach spot in the fence, named \u201cMalakeh Crossing.\u201d The maps highlighted the group\u2019s intended entrance, through two points \u2014 the front and the back entrance of a kibbutz. Sites designated \u201cAmbush 1\u201d and \u201cAmbush 2,\u201d noted on the surrounding main roads, indicated places where militants would create barriers and traps to block any rescue attempts.\n\n> Even more alarming to some analysts was the evidence of preparation for an extended attack. Hamas officials said they were surprised by their sweeping advances on Oct. 7 and were not prepared for deeper incursions into Israel, or possibly to the West Bank. Yet multiday supplies of food and gear were found amid the bodies of several assault teams, including the units that reached Ofakim and the nearby Urim military base, which serves as a command center for 8200, an elite Israeli intelligence unit.\n\n\n> Even if its current leadership is effectively destroyed, she said, Hamas and its followers will continue to regard Oct. 7 as a victory. That\u2019s partly because the group unquestionably succeeded in focusing the world\u2019s attention on the Palestinian conflict, she said.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I can remember that Hamas has become so prominent on a global scale,\u201d Katz said. \u201cSo many people have already forgotten Oct. 7 because Hamas immediately changed the discussion. It put the focus on Israel, not themselves. And that\u2019s exactly what they wanted.\u201d",

It is completely reliant on Israel for everything, and is subject to Israeli military incursions wherever the Israelis feel like it.\n\n> Netanyahu gave them control of an additional city\n\nEven [Netanyahu admitted](https://youtu.be/mvqCWvi-nFo?si=mkNnymcIdi4Z-YvL) (in a video in which he is unbelievably candid) that the reason he gave up part (not even all) of Hebron was that in exchange, the Americans agreed to a document saying that Israel had the right to unilaterally define parts of the West Bank as security areas. As Netanyahu explained, that allowed him to refuse to withdraw Israeli troops from anywhere in the West Bank. He said he gave up part of one city to keep the rest of the West Bank.\n\nThat move completely blocked the peace process, because Israeli withdrawal was a central part of the process. People forget that the peace process was supposed to lead to a Palestinian state by 1996 or '97. Netanyahu intentionally derailed the process. That's not surprising, given that the Likud party has always said, as one of its core tenets, that it will never allow Palestinian sovereignty, and given that Netanyahu himself vociferously opposed the peace process before he came into office.\n\n> Are you saying Egypt is not a full state because demilitarization was a condition for the return of Sinai?\n\nSorry, this is a ridiculous comparison. Egypt has a very serious military, which is capable of defending Egypt against Israeli attack. Demilitarizing a buffer region is very different from not having an army at all, and having a foreign army on your territory and controlling your airspace.

It is completely reliant on Israel for everything, and is subject to Israeli military incursions wherever the Israelis feel like it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Netanyahu gave them control of an additional city</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mvqCWvi-nFo?si=mkNnymcIdi4Z-YvL\">Netanyahu admitted</a> (in a video in which he is unbelievably candid) that the reason he gave up part (not even all) of Hebron was that in exchange, the Americans agreed to a document saying that Israel had the right to unilaterally define parts of the West Bank as security areas. As Netanyahu explained, that allowed him to refuse to withdraw Israeli troops from anywhere in the West Bank. He said he gave up part of one city to keep the rest of the West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>That move completely blocked the peace process, because Israeli withdrawal was a central part of the process. People forget that the peace process was supposed to lead to a Palestinian state by 1996 or &#39;97. Netanyahu intentionally derailed the process. That&#39;s not surprising, given that the Likud party has always said, as one of its core tenets, that it will never allow Palestinian sovereignty, and given that Netanyahu himself vociferously opposed the peace process before he came into office.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you saying Egypt is not a full state because demilitarization was a condition for the return of Sinai?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sorry, this is a ridiculous comparison. Egypt has a very serious military, which is capable of defending Egypt against Israeli attack. Demilitarizing a buffer region is very different from not having an army at all, and having a foreign army on your territory and controlling your airspace. That&#39;s before we even get into all the other conditions, like an Israeli veto over Palestinian foreign policy, control over Palestinian borders, etc.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>States are able to agree to such conditions and it doesn&#39;t make them not a state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It would completely rob Palestine of any freedom of action.

It&#39;s the immediate aftermath of the incident, where a corpse has collapsed on the ground. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>multiple forensics experts who came to the conclusion that she was indeed exposed </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She got shot by a direct fire weapon that doesn&#39;t use magic to go around corners. No kidding she was exposed. But exposed doesn&#39;t mean totally, 100% visible and still enough so an Israeli sniper can read &quot;PRESS&quot; written in English on her chest or back.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was clearly saying that finding Israel innocent in this case meant using a physically unfeasible standard of proof that would be impossible to meet in the absencence of a confession.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can&#39;t convict someone of murder without real evidence or a confession, oh poor you. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clearly your professional experience has made you biased enough not to even investigate the basic facts of the case,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basic facts of the case that a sniper meant to shoot people that day, therefore everyone he shot was actually murder. More so because he took the shot without making sure the writing on the victims chest was clearly identified first, which we all know is part of the Geneva Convention. And then had the absolute gumption to be Israeli, which really proves they&#39;re a murderer.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t think of anything more enjoyable than imagining you trying to defend yourself in traffic court. Just thinking about it is making me laugh.</p>\n</div>",

That means witness testimony, recordings, physical evidence, confessions, etc. \n\nSo in your scenario, journalists recording and distributing intelligence on ongoing combat ops, from the perspective not with friendly forces (he's embedded with the other team) gets smoked for filming what he shouldn't be. \n\nWhat law is broken? Murder of a non-combatant? But what's the proof? \n\nContrary to what most people know or hope for, combat isn't a civilized society where the burden of proof is on the shooter. It's too chaotic, collateral damage is guaranteed, etc. That's why nobody gets in trouble for the drone strikes on weddings and similar horrible situations, is the cost of doing business. People who don't deserve to get hurt are DEFINITELY going to get hurt. C'est la guerre. \n\nUnless your Russia or Syria or an equally cuddly nation state, you generally try to minimize it if for nothing else than it's bad optics. Bad for winning hearts and minds locally and abroad, especially in the age of social media. \n\nUnless you have the lawful order to go weapons free, engage anything not positively identified as friendly or noncombatant (happens often when the S hits the fan), most rules of engagement especially in low intensity conflicts with lots of noncombatants on the battlefield will require the shooter to positively identify the target first. \n\nIn the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, we did that by looking for Hostile Action, like aiming a rifle, fighting, etc, or hostile Intent,,a super vague term requiring a threat that can mean just about anything as long as one can properly articulate afterwards why they dropped someone.\n\nIn Iraq we were absolutely allowed to engage people videotaping us or scoping us with binos. Not suggesting everyone who did that got shot, it was usually up to the discretion of an NCO or officer on the scene, but the reasoning is that the enemy does recon too. That's hostile Intent, especially if regularly getting mortared, getting hit with IEDs is a major threat, getting sniped.\n\nSo if you're seeing someone video taping you, how do you know they are press and not an insurgent? Regardless, can you articulate afterwards why you didn't think the dead reporter was a reporter? If so, like the famous Reuters cameraman who got schwacked in Iraq by an Apache gunship, they got cleared because they thought the camera was an RPG and couldn't see any identifiers pointing out that guy hanging with insurgents was a reporter. And looking at their gun footage it was an easy mistake. Whoopsies happen in war, not actual crimes unless a charge is violated with a crime, and a convening authority wanting to go to trial. \n\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan, we also sometimes killed people digging on the side of the road ( laying IEDs). We could also shoot the wounded on the first sweep of assaulting an enemy position. Might be viewed as unethical or evil, but not murder, operating in a deliberate legal gray area because both can be viewed as attempted threats.\n\nTrophy APS is getting its first true test of hardcore combat in Gaza. Hamas are absolutely trying to find holes in its defenses and for that they need to record it to later analyze the footage. There is already plenty of evidence of insurgents having already done it. So when a IDF soldier sees someone in  highly violent active street fights where noncombatants aren't supposed to be hanging out, where RPGs are flying, and someone on the enemy side of the street is filming a friendly AFV that just got rocked by an AT weapon, there is a good likelihood that the shoot will be easily articulated and cleared.\n\nAfter they find out they killed a reporter, that's not good. The high up chain of command will be super pissed because of the bad optics, but the soldier who did it and likely their chain of command who would back them up will  probably be okay and not get charged. Mostly because any half-ass lawyer can beat that charge. \n\nAnd because top military brass charging their own for murder for stuff like that is often very bad for morale unless it's cut and dry evil, and it gets used as propaganda by the other side. So better to keep it quiet (which is another conversation altogether, the real darker side of this discussion). \n\nRealistically the guilty ones are the politicians and generals who ordered an assault on a populated city.",

They were later captured by U.S. ground troops.\n\nFor context, these unlucky SoB's were in a bunker that was shelled by an Iowa class battleship. When the drone flew through for battle damage assessment they heard it and ran out waving white clothing or such. And this was in 1991.\n\nHere's an interesting article from Westpoint I just found as the 2nd result for googling on this topic:\n\n[https://lieber.westpoint.edu/legal-practical-challenges-surrender-drones/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/legal-practical-challenges-surrender-drones/)\n\n>Thereafter, in this symposium, Brigadier General (ret.) David Wallace and Brigadier General Shane Reeves, 15th Dean of the Academic Board at West Point, highlighted such expansive use by providing a pr\u00e9cis of a nascent Ukrainian initiative inviting Russian soldiers to surrender to drones on the battlefield\u2014the \u201cI Want to Live\u201d project. Seeking \u201cto illustrate how technology is impacting the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the importance of applying the law with rigor and fidelity to seemingly new circumstances,\u201d they analyzed the project\u2019s intersection with the LOAC rule of surrender. Although recognizing the use of drones presents novel challenges, they concluded that \u201ca common-sense application of the rule of surrender\u201d should guide the analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In our view, this latter approach is more persuasive as it strikes an appropriate balance between the principles of humanity and military necessity. It recognizes there may be reasonable circumstances in which soldiers can successfully surrender to aircrews, even if aircrews lack the capability to take personnel into physical custody (see Oslo Manual, Comment 3 to Rule 104), in which case application of the rule benefits both the surrendering soldier (humanity) and his enemy (military necessity). But such a flexible approach also permits commanders, depending on the prevailing circumstances, to reduce risk to their forces and curb the rule\u2019s abuse (see Dinstein, 637; Robertson, pp. 112-13). It is also consistent with historical precedents in which ground forces have, in fact, surrendered to aircraft\u2014including the anecdotal video posted by Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense.\n\nI'm not going to go on a dive for it, but I feel reasonable confident that surrenders to helicopters were something that happened during the Vietnam War as well.\n\nThe so called laws of war rely on international convention, they're only as enforced as our morality directs us to.

And this was in 1991.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an interesting article from Westpoint I just found as the 2nd result for googling on this topic:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lieber.westpoint.edu/legal-practical-challenges-surrender-drones/\">https://lieber.westpoint.edu/legal-practical-challenges-surrender-drones/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thereafter, in this symposium, Brigadier General (ret.) David Wallace and Brigadier General Shane Reeves, 15th Dean of the Academic Board at West Point, highlighted such expansive use by providing a pr\u00e9cis of a nascent Ukrainian initiative inviting Russian soldiers to surrender to drones on the battlefield\u2014the \u201cI Want to Live\u201d project. Seeking \u201cto illustrate how technology is impacting the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the importance of applying the law with rigor and fidelity to seemingly new circumstances,\u201d they analyzed the project\u2019s intersection with the LOAC rule of surrender. Although recognizing the use of drones presents novel challenges, they concluded that \u201ca common-sense application of the rule of surrender\u201d should guide the analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In our view, this latter approach is more persuasive as it strikes an appropriate balance between the principles of humanity and military necessity. It recognizes there may be reasonable circumstances in which soldiers can successfully surrender to aircrews, even if aircrews lack the capability to take personnel into physical custody (see Oslo Manual, Comment 3 to Rule 104), in which case application of the rule benefits both the surrendering soldier (humanity) and his enemy (military necessity). But such a flexible approach also permits commanders, depending on the prevailing circumstances, to reduce risk to their forces and curb the rule\u2019s abuse (see Dinstein, 637; Robertson, pp. 112-13). It is also consistent with historical precedents in which ground forces have, in fact, surrendered to aircraft\u2014including the anecdotal video posted by Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to go on a dive for it, but I feel reasonable confident that surrenders to helicopters were something that happened during the Vietnam War as well.</p>\n\n<p>The so called laws of war rely on international convention, they&#39;re only as enforced as our morality directs us to. So which side of such moral dilemmas do you want to stand on?</p>\n</div>",
