        "body": "Here we are for the second part of my tactical analysis of the front in Ukraine, after the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1al2dt7/comment/kpemkxc/). Today we will focus exclusively on the Avdiivka sector.\n\nThe Russians' goal is to take the city before the mid-March elections. The military observer Kovalenko wrote that before the elections the Russians have two goals: this, and clearing the Ukrainian bridgehead in Krynky, as I wrote yesterday. Should they be successful regarding Avdiivka, according to him there would be a long operational pause in the area to reconstitute the 1st Corps (8th Army, SMD) while the formations of the Central MD could likely return to the north, but not to Kreminna (where they came from in early October), but to the Kupyansk sector, which could become the main Russian effort. \n\nRussians have been attacking with reckless disregard for casualties \u2013 the day before yesterday on the \"Poisk_in_UA\" channel a video was posted, where a company commander of the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps complained that he was forced to advance by the brigade commander, who threatened to kill him if he retreated. The company commander reports serious problems in the training of soldiers and in the quality of medical care (and financial extortion against relatives of wounded servicemen is also widespread); he also stated that of the initial 200 men under his lead, he has only 40 men left, half of whom are wounded. Mashovets wrote how very recently this brigade integrated several battalions of the Territorial Forces into its structure to make up for losses. The brigades of the Central MD active around Avdiivka have been replenished with men from the 1308th Regiment of the Territorial Forces. There are numerous regiments of the Territorial Forces around Avdiivka, acting as reinforcement and support for the regular units and to make up for losses in them. I have identified the following territorial regiments active in the sector: the 1004th, 1007th, 1140th, 1231st (uncertain), 1308th, 1453rd, 1454th and 1487th, as well as the 504th Tank Regiment. A good chunk of them is under-strenght, however. Beside them, around and in Avdiivka there are the brigades of the 2nd Army of the Central MD (15th, 21st and 30th), all engaged in the north-east flank, and those of the 41st Army of the CMD (35th, 55th and 74th), active in the southern flank. To them we must add the units of the 90th Tank Division engaged around Avdiivka, the 10th Tank Regiment and the 57th Motorized Regiment (the latter is largely a reserve) of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps, in addition, of course, to the units of the 1st Corps: the 114th and elements of the 132nd Motorized Brigades in the north-east flank, as well as the 109th Motorized Regiment and several separate battalions (including \"Pyatnashka\"); on the southern flank the 9th \"Marine\" Brigade (actually motorized), the 1st and 110th Motorized Brigades, the 87th and 111th Motorized Regiments as well as the \"Sparta\" and \"Somalia\" Battalions. And there are also Spetsnaz GRU detachments from the Central MD as well as elements of the \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\u201d. The Russian grouping is really large - after all, Avdiivka is the Russian main effort.\n\nThe Russians are suffering huge losses but are bringing new forces into the area. There are indications that more and more elements of the 90th Tank Division of the 41st Army have arrived or are in the process of doing so. The 239th Tank Regiment of this division had already arrived in Avdiivka in early November and has been involved in the attacks around Stepove. Russian sources have mentioned, in the recent weeks, the presence of both the 80th and 6th Tank Regiments of the 90th Tank Division in the Avdiivka sector and as far as I have seen, Ukrainian sources have lately confirmed the presence of these two regiments too. In addition, from Russian MIAs notices, I read that a few days ago the wife of a Russian soldier reported the disappearance of her beloved one in a video, stating that she lost contact with him after January 23, the last day he spoke to her. He is a mobilized serviceman in the 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division, active until now in the Serebrianka Forest in the Kreminna sector, where the soldier confirmed to his wife he was. However, during the last phone call, he also told his wife that they would be sent \"somewhere\u201d. We shall see. In any case, the 400th Artillery Regiment of this division had already been reported around Avdiivka, so it would mean that potentially the entire division may have been moved here, including the Storm-V detachments attached to this formation.\n\nIn addition to this, Naalsio and the rest of the Warspotting team identified the tactical marks of the 69th Covering Brigade of the 35th Army of the EMD in a destroyed BMP-1P near Nevelske, south of Pervomaiske (southern flank of Avdiivka). So far neither Ukrainian nor Russian sources have mentioned the presence of elements of the 35th Army in this sector. Let\u2019s recall that the 35th Army has been the garrison of the Polohy sector and was only marginally involved in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, unlike its neighbors (the 58th Army of the SMD in the Orikhiv sector and the 5th and 36th Armies of the EMD in the Velyka Novosilka sector). At the moment it is therefore probably the freshest Russian CAA. Mashovets had mentioned in early December that the 69th Covering Brigade, along with other smaller units from the Russian Army's \"Zaporizhzhia\" and \"Vostok\" Groups of Forces, had been withdrawn from the front and assigned to the strategic reserve. \n\nThere are arrivals of reserves on the Ukrainian side as well. There are indications that elements of the 2nd \"Galician\" Brigade of the National Guard are arriving in Avdiivka. In addition, in late January there was a protest in Chernivtsi by relatives of soldiers from the 92nd Territorial Defense Battalion of the 107th TDF Brigade, made up (for the vast majority) of residents of the city and surrounding municipalities. According to what I read in the Ukrainian media (I also spoke with a member of this battalion who left the unit last month for another branch of the UAF), this battalion has fought around Bakhmut for several months in late 2023, where it suffered casualties. In late December it was withdrawn to the rear. According to reports from soldiers in this unit and their relatives, the battalion recently has been disbanded and the servicemen were all assigned as infantrymen to the 110th Mechanized Brigade, which we know where it\u2019s fighting. The complaints are that there was little time to rest and the battalion had not fully replenished the losses yet. The soldiers also complained that they were told they would stay in the third line, while once they arrived they were ordered to go to the first line with threats of desertion charges for those who refused. The soldiers complied, but through the relatives\u2019 protest they aim to cause public outrage. This is not the first time issues have arisen within this battalion. The colonel who commands the 107th TDF Brigade denies that the battalion has been disbanded, but confirms that he no longer has authority over it and it has been assigned to the \u201cDonetsk\u201d Tactical-Operational Grouping (which has jurisdiction over Avdiivka). In general, there are indications that the Territorial Defense Forces are being gradually downsized and there are dubious rumors about the future of this branch of the UAF. I\u2019m gathering information about this and will do a write-up on this matter in the near future.\n\nLet's now do a recap of the events of the last few weeks. The situation is very fluid; what I write today may no longer be true the day after tomorrow. Until mid-January, things in Avdiivka looked decent. Russian advances in the north-east flank were minimal. Towards the city itself there had been no considerable progress. The Russian breakthrough in the industrial zone (known as Promka) in November had been halted. Tsarska Ohota was holding finely and Russian advances in the southern flank had been almost non-existent. What happened? General/strategic and tactical problems. On the first level, after months of resistance, the Ukrainian garrison was suffering attrition, fatigue, lack of shells. Two or even three weeks-long shifts on the front lines before being rotated have been the norm since December. Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting with heroism and determination, and this managed to compensate for deficiencies in other aspects. On the second level, the Russians have had clear tactical successes. Second part below.",

            "body": "Meanwhile, the situation along the flanks remains stable. The Russians never managed to occupy the center of Stepove. Their actions to flank this village, firstly from the south and then from the north, proved unsuccessful. Similarly, Russian advances toward Hill 240 (at the intersection of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk and the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railway lines) and Novokalynove were really minimal. \n\nThe Ukrainian grouping in the north-eastern and northern flanks is very strong and is tasked with preventing either the Russians from closing the pocket (by advancing through Berdychi or the Coke Plant), or widening it (by taking Ocheretyne, a village relevant to Ukrainian logistics). For the first task, there are the 47th and the bulk of the 116th Mech Brigades in the area, supported by the 2nd Mech Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade, as well as elements of the 129th TDF Brigade, the 26th, 45th and 63rd Separate Rifle Battalions, the 407th Rifle Battalion of the 143rd Infantry Brigade, and a detachment of \"Omega Group\", i.e. the special forces unit of the National Guard. For the second task, there are the bulk of the 23rd and 31st Mech Brigades, the 71st Jager Brigade, the 52nd Separate Rifle Battalion, elements of the 109th, 116th and 129th TDF Brigades and the 1st Mech Battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade. The second grouping is not being employed in the fighting inside Avdiivka, as the positions it covers are very important. This is largely true for the first grouping as well - only a part of it is fighting inside Avdiivka, while the bulk will have to form a reserve to prevent the loss of the area around the Coke Plant and to stop the Russians in case of the loss of the city and a breakthrough to the west.\n\nFor the southern flank, the 53rd Mech Brigade, likely supported by the 13th Motorized Battalion of the 58th Motorized Brigade and a battalion of the 109th TDF Brigade, did an excellent job during these months. The Russians never managed to get any closer to Sjeverne. \n\nAs I had written in the past, the Russians after mid-January managed to seize the former restaurant \"Tsarska Ohota\" and advance into the city's private sector. About 150 men, mainly from the \"Veterans\" Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade, passed through a sewer pipe and popped up just before the private sector of Soborna Street. At that point a part of this detachment went south, where they eliminated the Ukrainian garrison in the former restaurant, killing or capturing the soldiers, another rampaged into the city's private sector along Soborna, Sportyvna and Chernyshevskoho Streets, before the Ukrainians fully realized what was happening and were able to take countermeasures. \n\nSeveral Ukrainian counterattacks occurred in the following days and weeks, from elements of the 47th and 116th Mech Brigades, both of which arrived from the north-east flank of Avdiivka. There were also Ukrainian mechanized counterattacks towards the private sector around Soborna Street and the Tsarska Ohota, including with the use of Bradleys from the 47th. At the same time, the Russians tried to provide armored support with tanks and BMP-2s to their garrison in the private sector and in the restaurant area, but these were all destroyed by the Ukrainians. These Ukrainian counterattacks have not been particularly successful in driving the Russians out of the captured positions, but they have at least managed to somewhat stabilize the situation, preventing the Russians from capturing the entirety of these streets - at the moment, based on geolocations, clashes are taking place in the initial part of these streets (towards the city), but before the intersection with Nekrasova Street. Towards Lisna Street there have been no Russian advances, while the situation in the area of the holiday cottages in Skotovata remains unclear (I believe they are gray area). Apart from elements of the 47th and 116th, the area of the private sector around Soborna Street and the Ukrainian positions just before Lisna Street are defended by the 468th Rifle Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade, the 6th Separate Rifle Battalion, the \"Kyiv\" Police Regiment and a detachment of the Border Guards.\n\nThe Russians are also trying to advance from the Promka and the vineyard area into the private sector to the west, defended by the 1st Mech Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade, but currently without success. DeepState reported that the 74th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to recover a position lost by the 110th Mech Brigade - the counterattack was unsuccessful and ended with the deaths of several Ukrainian drone operators who were officially framed as scouts in this battalion. This reignited the debate about the need to create drone operator units detached from maneuver units, and as we saw a branch of the UAF dedicated to drones has been just created.\n\nThe Russians from Opytne (specifically, the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army and 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, which together with the 87th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps are the units attacking along Soborna Street) have advanced a few hundred meters towards the former base of the anti-aircraft missile regiment, known as \"Zenith\". However, despite initial rumors, this important stronghold is still in Ukrainian hands; indeed, according to Mashovets in late January there was even a small Ukrainian counterattack that pushed the Russians back 80 to 100 meters from its southern flank. In itself, taking Zenith will not be easy, since it houses an anti-nuclear bunker. The problem, however, concerns the supply level. If the Russians were able to cross the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata railway and cut the T-05-05 Road, which through \"Cheburashka\u201d (another Ukrainian stronghold, it\u2019s the junction between T-05-05 Road and the unfinished ring road) supplies Zenith, it would be a very big problem. Zenith is a very important position because it helps to secure the southern flank of the city itself, and if they managed to seize it, the Russians could advance into the 9th District (the neighborhood of high rises buildings west of the railroad). \n\nWith the 110th Mech Brigade severely attrited and the arrival of elements of the 47th and 116th to the south, the area between the Avdiivka Reservoir and the Sand Quarry (i.e. the big lake north-east of the city) was particularly undefended. At that point, between late last month and early February, the Russians had another major tactical success. After reaching the Sand Quarry from the east, advancing along the Kamianka creek, they were able to suddenly advance (perhaps aided by bad weather, with the consequences it brings to reconnaissance) along the entire area of the dachas east of the reservoir, advancing southwards for 1,5 km. At that point, Ukrainian positions along the two forest belts between these two directions were all but surrounded by the Russians on three sides, with the Sand Quarry to the south. As a result, the Ukrainians retreated. Per Russian sources, former Wagnerite veterans of the Battle of Bakhmut were reportedly appointed leaders of Russian assault squads which then stormed this area.\n\nFrom the direction of Kamianka creek (elements of the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and of the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army attacked there), Russian progress was halted, thanks to Ukrainian control of a \u201cTerrikon\u201d south-east of the Sand Quarry which oversees the Kamianka valley, garrisoned by the 2nd Mech Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade.\n\nThe Russians (elements of the 114th Motorized Brigade, of the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army and of the 90th Tank Division), though, from the western side of the Sand Quarry, were able to break through into the private sector of Avdiivka via Zaliznychnyi Lane, capturing the garden center along this street. Russian sources also report the presence in this area of elements of the 115th Brigade of the Special Forces of the Rosgvardia, which is reportedly specialized in urban combat. That part of Avdiivka's private sector is defended by the 3rd Mech Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade and by the 1st Mech Battalion of the 116th Mech Brigade, supported by elements of the 8th SOF Regiment.\n\nHere the Russians have two plans. Continuing to advance southwards in the private sector (the Ukrainians may have retreated along Shestaskova Street - we shall see that in the next few days), and above all to cross the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway and cut the O0542 road, i.e. the main supply artery to Avdiivka, from Lastochkyne. In this context, the Russians have two targets: the former \"Brevno\" restaurant (near the intersection of the O0542 road with the Industrialnyy Prospekt), and, a little further south, the Avdiivka bus depot. A counterattack by Ukrainian special forces of the 8th SOF Regiment had managed to neutralize several Russian assault squads and keep them pinned down for a few days along Donetska Street, but the Russians have reportedly already taken control of the railway overpass after Chystyakova Street and are attempting to storm the dachas in the direction of the bus depot. This is a make-or-break moment for the city's hold. The Russians are not even 1 km from Brevno. The status of the dachas area east of the Coke Plant is unknown, but it\u2019s possible that the Ukrainians have withdrawn from there.\n\nMeanwhile, some Russian units of the 15th and 21st Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Army and of the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps are continuing to attack around Stepove, to keep up the pressure there.

Similarly, Russian advances toward Hill 240 (at the intersection of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk and the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railway lines) and Novokalynove were really minimal. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian grouping in the north-eastern and northern flanks is very strong and is tasked with preventing either the Russians from closing the pocket (by advancing through Berdychi or the Coke Plant), or widening it (by taking Ocheretyne, a village relevant to Ukrainian logistics). For the first task, there are the 47th and the bulk of the 116th Mech Brigades in the area, supported by the 2nd Mech Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade, as well as elements of the 129th TDF Brigade, the 26th, 45th and 63rd Separate Rifle Battalions, the 407th Rifle Battalion of the 143rd Infantry Brigade, and a detachment of &quot;Omega Group&quot;, i.e. the special forces unit of the National Guard. For the second task, there are the bulk of the 23rd and 31st Mech Brigades, the 71st Jager Brigade, the 52nd Separate Rifle Battalion, elements of the 109th, 116th and 129th TDF Brigades and the 1st Mech Battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade. The second grouping is not being employed in the fighting inside Avdiivka, as the positions it covers are very important. This is largely true for the first grouping as well - only a part of it is fighting inside Avdiivka, while the bulk will have to form a reserve to prevent the loss of the area around the Coke Plant and to stop the Russians in case of the loss of the city and a breakthrough to the west.</p>\n\n<p>For the southern flank, the 53rd Mech Brigade, likely supported by the 13th Motorized Battalion of the 58th Motorized Brigade and a battalion of the 109th TDF Brigade, did an excellent job during these months. The Russians never managed to get any closer to Sjeverne. </p>\n\n<p>As I had written in the past, the Russians after mid-January managed to seize the former restaurant &quot;Tsarska Ohota&quot; and advance into the city&#39;s private sector. About 150 men, mainly from the &quot;Veterans&quot; Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade, passed through a sewer pipe and popped up just before the private sector of Soborna Street. At that point a part of this detachment went south, where they eliminated the Ukrainian garrison in the former restaurant, killing or capturing the soldiers, another rampaged into the city&#39;s private sector along Soborna, Sportyvna and Chernyshevskoho Streets, before the Ukrainians fully realized what was happening and were able to take countermeasures. </p>\n\n<p>Several Ukrainian counterattacks occurred in the following days and weeks, from elements of the 47th and 116th Mech Brigades, both of which arrived from the north-east flank of Avdiivka. There were also Ukrainian mechanized counterattacks towards the private sector around Soborna Street and the Tsarska Ohota, including with the use of Bradleys from the 47th. At the same time, the Russians tried to provide armored support with tanks and BMP-2s to their garrison in the private sector and in the restaurant area, but these were all destroyed by the Ukrainians. These Ukrainian counterattacks have not been particularly successful in driving the Russians out of the captured positions, but they have at least managed to somewhat stabilize the situation, preventing the Russians from capturing the entirety of these streets - at the moment, based on geolocations, clashes are taking place in the initial part of these streets (towards the city), but before the intersection with Nekrasova Street. Towards Lisna Street there have been no Russian advances, while the situation in the area of the holiday cottages in Skotovata remains unclear (I believe they are gray area). Apart from elements of the 47th and 116th, the area of the private sector around Soborna Street and the Ukrainian positions just before Lisna Street are defended by the 468th Rifle Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade, the 6th Separate Rifle Battalion, the &quot;Kyiv&quot; Police Regiment and a detachment of the Border Guards.</p>\n\n<p>The Russians are also trying to advance from the Promka and the vineyard area into the private sector to the west, defended by the 1st Mech Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade, but currently without success. DeepState reported that the 74th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to recover a position lost by the 110th Mech Brigade - the counterattack was unsuccessful and ended with the deaths of several Ukrainian drone operators who were officially framed as scouts in this battalion. This reignited the debate about the need to create drone operator units detached from maneuver units, and as we saw a branch of the UAF dedicated to drones has been just created.</p>\n\n<p>The Russians from Opytne (specifically, the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army and 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, which together with the 87th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps are the units attacking along Soborna Street) have advanced a few hundred meters towards the former base of the anti-aircraft missile regiment, known as &quot;Zenith&quot;. However, despite initial rumors, this important stronghold is still in Ukrainian hands; indeed, according to Mashovets in late January there was even a small Ukrainian counterattack that pushed the Russians back 80 to 100 meters from its southern flank. In itself, taking Zenith will not be easy, since it houses an anti-nuclear bunker. The problem, however, concerns the supply level. If the Russians were able to cross the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata railway and cut the T-05-05 Road, which through &quot;Cheburashka\u201d (another Ukrainian stronghold, it\u2019s the junction between T-05-05 Road and the unfinished ring road) supplies Zenith, it would be a very big problem. Zenith is a very important position because it helps to secure the southern flank of the city itself, and if they managed to seize it, the Russians could advance into the 9th District (the neighborhood of high rises buildings west of the railroad). </p>\n\n<p>With the 110th Mech Brigade severely attrited and the arrival of elements of the 47th and 116th to the south, the area between the Avdiivka Reservoir and the Sand Quarry (i.e. the big lake north-east of the city) was particularly undefended. At that point, between late last month and early February, the Russians had another major tactical success. After reaching the Sand Quarry from the east, advancing along the Kamianka creek, they were able to suddenly advance (perhaps aided by bad weather, with the consequences it brings to reconnaissance) along the entire area of the dachas east of the reservoir, advancing southwards for 1,5 km. At that point, Ukrainian positions along the two forest belts between these two directions were all but surrounded by the Russians on three sides, with the Sand Quarry to the south. As a result, the Ukrainians retreated. Per Russian sources, former Wagnerite veterans of the Battle of Bakhmut were reportedly appointed leaders of Russian assault squads which then stormed this area.</p>\n\n<p>From the direction of Kamianka creek (elements of the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and of the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army attacked there), Russian progress was halted, thanks to Ukrainian control of a \u201cTerrikon\u201d south-east of the Sand Quarry which oversees the Kamianka valley, garrisoned by the 2nd Mech Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade.</p>\n\n<p>The Russians (elements of the 114th Motorized Brigade, of the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army and of the 90th Tank Division), though, from the western side of the Sand Quarry, were able to break through into the private sector of Avdiivka via Zaliznychnyi Lane, capturing the garden center along this street. Russian sources also report the presence in this area of elements of the 115th Brigade of the Special Forces of the Rosgvardia, which is reportedly specialized in urban combat. That part of Avdiivka&#39;s private sector is defended by the 3rd Mech Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade and by the 1st Mech Battalion of the 116th Mech Brigade, supported by elements of the 8th SOF Regiment.</p>\n\n<p>Here the Russians have two plans. Continuing to advance southwards in the private sector (the Ukrainians may have retreated along Shestaskova Street - we shall see that in the next few days), and above all to cross the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway and cut the O0542 road, i.e. the main supply artery to Avdiivka, from Lastochkyne. In this context, the Russians have two targets: the former &quot;Brevno&quot; restaurant (near the intersection of the O0542 road with the Industrialnyy Prospekt), and, a little further south, the Avdiivka bus depot. A counterattack by Ukrainian special forces of the 8th SOF Regiment had managed to neutralize several Russian assault squads and keep them pinned down for a few days along Donetska Street, but the Russians have reportedly already taken control of the railway overpass after Chystyakova Street and are attempting to storm the dachas in the direction of the bus depot. This is a make-or-break moment for the city&#39;s hold. The Russians are not even 1 km from Brevno. The status of the dachas area east of the Coke Plant is unknown, but it\u2019s possible that the Ukrainians have withdrawn from there.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, some Russian units of the 15th and 21st Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Army and of the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps are continuing to attack around Stepove, to keep up the pressure there. Last part below.</p>\n</div>",

As far as I know, there are numerous underground tunnels (not sewer pipes, actual tunnels) under Avdiivka, which the Ukrainians have been building since 2015 and are connected with the underground bunkers of the Coke Plant. I\u2019m not aware where these tunnels lead, but it\u2019s going to be a factor that will count for the whole matter. And let's also remember that the Russians are hammering Avdiivka with KABs. According to the city administration, more have fallen in 2024 than in all of 2023, and the day before yesterday 37 fell in just one day. As a result, the Ukrainians have to decrease the number of men in the first lines to avoid mass casualty events (and have to keep most of the men under the ground), causing problems if manpower is needed to solve tactical problems in the very short term.\n\nThings have also gotten worse in the area of the Donetsk Filtration Station, an Ukrainian stronghold east of the H20 Road garrisoned by the 12th Rifle Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade. DeepState has not yet reported it, but according to geolocations the Russians (I believe elements of the 21st and 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Army) passed the stretch of the H20 Road that is marked as still in Ukrainian hands south of Kamianka, and simultaneously they consolidated control around the \"Third Pond\" (the first, from the north, among the three ponds north-east of the DFS), passing the H20 Road there as well. In addition, the Russians had also gained some positions along the forested area north-west of the intersection of Yasynovskyi Lane with the H20 Road. This could seriously compromise the hold of the DFS. Should it fall, the Russians will have a way to spread into the area around the Baikove cemetery and the Avdiivka\u2019s private sector by attacking from the east. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get into the debate about whether the city will fall or not or whether the Ukrainians should withdraw or not - I am reporting the facts. I personally thought, in October, that the \u201cgame\u201d for the city would be played exclusively on the flanks, meaning I believed that the Russians would not make progress in the private sector but aimed only at closing the pocket and forcing the Ukrainians to withdraw. This was indeed their original plan, but Ukrainian resistance on the flanks was better than one could have hoped for. The problem is that the Russians since January have completely changed strategy in favor of urban battle. This benefits them: their losses in proportion to Ukrainian losses are not as heavy (in terms of the ratio) as they are in the flanks, and once the Russians get into the houses driving them out is a costly and difficult pain in the back, since they immediately bring soldiers to occupy the basements of the houses and the Ukrainians are in no condition to carry out successful urban counterattacks (while on the contrary there have been successful counterattacks in the flanks, such as the one in the forest belt south of Stepove). The Ukrainians' best ally is good visibility, and inside a built-up area this is often lacking. \n\nThe Ukrainian priority now is to keep the Russians away from Brevno and in general not let them cross the railroad, just like they have been successfully doing for months in the area of the Coke Plant. Again, on the holding of the city's private sector east of the railroad, I cannot make any predictions. One possible option for the Ukrainians might be to retreat, if needed, west of the railroad and keep defending the area bounded between the Coke Plant and the 9th District. Possibly up to Zenith as well, but there is a serious possibility that it would have to be abandoned if the Russians succeeded in crossing the railroad south of the 9th District. At the moment the situation could still be stabilized, but it depends on the feasibility of such thing and its cost to the Ukrainians, which may or may not be acceptable. Beside that, no - there is no a serious chance for a Russian pocket of Ukrainian positions inside the city. Except for Mariupol for obvious reasons, these are simply not things that happen in this war above the platoon level, for a set of reasons. \n\nIf the Russians were to get to Brevno, things would get quite complicated, to say the least. To supply the Coke Plant, there is a dirt road from Orlivka. Theoretically, the 9th District and the positions east of the railroad could still be supplied, via a dirt road from Sjeverne. But there is the question of whether would it be worth to keep defending in that context. One thing I wrote often during October is that Avdiivka is its own Coke Plant, for the good and the bad. Let's also recall that according to Russian sources the Ukrainians are also building fortifications in the rear of Avdiivka, and resistance in the city also is needed to buy time in this regard.\n\nTo conclude, there have been major Russian advances in Pervomaiske, defended by the Ukrainian 59th Motorized Brigade. The 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, supported by the 9th \u201cMarine\u201d Brigade of the same corps, has advanced 1,4 km over the recent weeks from Pisky towards the center of Pervomaiske, capturing the houses parallel to the Izmaylovsky Stavok lake. There is very, very fierce fighting for every house. However, the consequences of the Russian advance here are far from being tragic. There are also Russian attacks against Nevelske, which, however, were unsuccessful.",

It's the only battle in which there were battalions that surrendered, along with their HQs. But otherwise, there have not even been companies in this war that were captured entirely, as far as I know. Events where more than one squad is captured at the same time are rare (in that case, generally, both sides tend to post it on social media). To my memory, one of the biggest such event was the capture of 61 Ukrainian soldiers in Makariv (west of Kyiv) in March 2022; the Ukrainians captured several Russian squads during the Kharkiv counteroffensive or during this summer in clashes in the southern flank of Bakhmut; another event was the surrender of a Storm Z platoon made up of 22 soldiers, I think early last summer, near Avdiivka. The vast majority of POWs are taken in single-digit groups of men, that is, generally, those holding a trench, a fortification, an house or foxholes.\n\nI have several theories about this, feel free to tell me what you think. I don't want to make this matter about Ukrainians vs. Russians, actually I think these are things that apply to both sides, on average.\n\n1) Morale is higher than in other wars. It's rare for soldiers to surrender voluntarily, and even in situations where there could be risks of an encirclement, the unit will generally continue to fight to avoid it. \n\n2) Force density on the front lines is lower than in past conflicts, both because armies today are smaller (at population parity) and because of guided munitions and drone-adjusted artillery. Only a small fraction of the men in a brigade will be deployed to the first lines at any given time, barring problems when more are needed. \n\n3) The command (I repeat, from both sides) is on average more competent than in other conflicts of the past. They have more attachment to reality. Let's look at the Russians who, when the Ukrainians broke through in Kharkiv Oblast in September 2022, immediately retreated to the east of the Oskil, leaving countless armored vehicles on the other side but still saving themselves or not falling as POWs. At the same time, state leaders are generally more rational or at least less deranged and blinded by ideology. We know of Zelensky's determination to keep Bakhmut, but I don't doubt that he would have ordered his men to leave if there was really a risk of the Russians closing the pocket. We are not at the levels of e.g. Hitler in the WW2. \n\n4) Also as a corollary to the previous point, communications today tend to be very good relative to the past. Yes, there are still numerous (I repeat, numerous) problems with that, but often if an unit is in danger of encirclement or otherwise if nearby positions are lost, the unit in question is likely to know about it fast enough. \n\n5) Motorization. Hard to underestimate this point. The huge pockets of WW2 are often the story of motorized vs foot armies. When, in the worst case, a civilian car is readily available anyway, it's much more difficult for units of a certain size to be surrounded. Case in point: four Ukrainian battalions managed to withdraw from Zolote/Hirske in June 2022 just hours before the Russians closed the pocket entirely.\n\nIf we want to make historical comparisons, all these points did not apply in the Iran-Iraq war, which also has numerous similarities with the current war and is the most recent conflict among those directly comparable to this one. Let's look at the liberation of Khorramshahr by the Iranians in the spring of 1982. 19k (!) Iraqi soldiers were captured. With Saddam Hussein going batshit crazy and executing the commander of an armored division that was supposed to defend the city. The orders, however, were to hold out to the bitter end, there was poor motorization, I guess communications were scarce as well, there was a very high density of forces on the front lines, and finally Iraqi soldiers had pretty bad morale - Iraq had big problems on this matter until 1986, as the bulk of their conscripts were Shiites, and not so eager to wage war on the Iranians who are Shiites too (whereas in the Republican Guard there were Sunnis as well as some Christians).",

Case in point: four Ukrainian battalions managed to withdraw from Zolote/Hirske in June 2022 just hours before the Russians closed the pocket entirely.</p>\n\n<p>If we want to make historical comparisons, all these points did not apply in the Iran-Iraq war, which also has numerous similarities with the current war and is the most recent conflict among those directly comparable to this one. Let&#39;s look at the liberation of Khorramshahr by the Iranians in the spring of 1982. 19k (!) Iraqi soldiers were captured. With Saddam Hussein going batshit crazy and executing the commander of an armored division that was supposed to defend the city. The orders, however, were to hold out to the bitter end, there was poor motorization, I guess communications were scarce as well, there was a very high density of forces on the front lines, and finally Iraqi soldiers had pretty bad morale - Iraq had big problems on this matter until 1986, as the bulk of their conscripts were Shiites, and not so eager to wage war on the Iranians who are Shiites too (whereas in the Republican Guard there were Sunnis as well as some Christians).</p>\n</div>",

I can't really think of any encirclement attempt in the war, even Mariupol, that wasn't telegraphed well in advance. That means there is usually plenty of time for defenders to create escape plans, even if informally, and execute them.\n\nAnd I disagree with commands being excellent. I believe the poor tactical level command and staff are big reason that encirclements are impossible.\n\nTo achieve a breakthrough of a forward defense, defeat counterattacks, break past any temporary roadblocks set up to stall/buy time, to overcome mines or other obstacles, to know when to attack and when to bypass, etc, that involves great skill, competence, and especially flexibility.\n\nStarting off it requires all the above contingencies built into a plan that starts with a successful tactical breakthrough, with either the assaulting forces that perform a successful attack that might allow even a small tactical encirclement themselves able and willing to keep going, to keep risking themselves with the hopes of bagging a large number of enemy forces, usually needing an echeloned reserve force to pass through the first echelon (no easy task of itself). And that only describes what's needed for a single axis, to perform an encirclement, that usually requires a concentric attack, two axes attacking separately, both achieving a breakthrough, both possessing sufficient, trained, and ready forces to exploit it for a \"deep\" drive into the enemy's rear to cut off any escape routes.\n\nAn example of that seems to be the followup attack after Popasna fell, where Wagner or some other force quickly broke through the newly manned UAF defenses and headed out to three different directions. I'd heard the Russians achieved that by having a literal Operational Maneuver Group assembled and ready just for that purpose, though that remains to be seen. But even that couldn't achieve an encirclement. \n\nZolote was probably the closest that should have, but neither side could bust through the final defenses necessary to close the pincers. It seems they tried, they just couldn't pull it off in time.  \n\nNot to belittle UAF or Russian forces unnecessarily, it's a very hard operation to pull off. It's the ultimate goal of top notch maneuver focused armies, but really only possible with those who are regularly fighting weak opponents or are themselves highly competent at the tactical level (Germany in WW2 for both). Overall, it's a very high risk though high reward. \n\nTo even attempt it at the lower tactical levels requires highly capable battalion and brigade/regt command and staff, plus the platoon and company maneuver elements involved in the breakthrough and exploitation need to be highly competent, well led, very motivated and aggressive, with the on-the-move communication to allow them to good situational awareness to know that they just achieved a breakthrough that might be exploitable, as well as knowing another breakthrough happened too. \n\nThat doesn't describe this war. For both sides, battalions HQs are deliberately light on staff officers, often with less-than-excellent battalion commanders in overall command. Bde/Regt HQs filled with barely trained staff are overwhelmed conducting even deliberate set-piece, highly choreographed operations, let alone able to coordinate a highly complex, chaotic mobile operations where spontaneity is a requirement.\n\nThe Russians don't even use a command system that really allows for tactical level encirclements, they deliberately strangle initiative among the tactical leadership.\n\nThe Ukrainians allow more, but even they don't possess the skill and competence to perform simultaneous combined arms attacks. Multiple credible sources have said as much, their tactical HQs can only coordinate a couple companies at a time doing sequential ops, not synchronized. Meaning if they were an orchestra, their flutes play some notes and stop, their tubas play some notes and stop, then their strings play some notes and stop, but they are unable to play together and make the music sound well.\n\nIf an attacking force can't perform synchronized ops, how can it conduct the concentric dual-prong breakthroughs and exploitations necessary to conduct a tactical level encirclement?\n\nAnd if they can't even achieve larger scale breakthroughs beyond platoon and company level, how can they achieve operational level encirclements? Those require very deep drives into the enemy rear areas, beyond their artillery parks, to capture major supply hubs and other areas used as operational supply lines. Those require numerous tactical breakthroughs occurring simultaneously, in perfect concert with each other, then multiple successful exploitations, all heading towards a common target to link up to seal a cauldron. \n\nThat's why there are only small scale surrenders. Individual troops in static positions who are too slow to escape are encountered by advancing forces, they either surrender or die. It doesn't need to be coordinated by anything, its just the byproduct of a successful small unit attack. Battalion and Bde/Regt command and staff are immaterial besides the support they provided to allow for the small unit success, there is no coordination, orders, or anything else to make it happen.\n\nBut as soon as those tactical HQs are expected to provide a major role, they're probably going to fail.",

                "body": "Have to agree here by my notes on the InfOps. Remember, Putin here is curating messages for domestic and foreign audiences, not necessarily to be watched in one go, but for 'clips' to spread also.\n\nFor the domestic side: \nRussian state media now has thousands of hours worth of broadcast material to use, with the added bonus of a western journos involvement. Many citizens themselves are dubious - to say the least - of state media and having a seemingly 'unbiased' interviewer does lend weight. After all, there's an election coming up. And this 'reasonable' Putin let's him position himself as a man willing to talk to the west, like all good dictators he must be the only solution to any problem he's caused. The 'denazification', part is perhaps equivalent to Bibi's destroy hamas goal. While you are reasonable and open to options of peace, you have a nigh impossible goal to fall back on if you wish to continue current policy. For one more than the other, war is keeping them in power.\n\nFor foreign audiences:\nVery US heavy messaging. I did expect more countries to fall into his propaganda (kremlin loves to go after 'british intelligence' etc.) but the only other to get a strong mention was Germany. This primarily revolved around nord-stream and Germany's decoupling goals from Rus energy. It is a sore point in Germany and will likely be co-opted by the far-right resurgence there, as a talking point.\n\nBut this was really all about the US and the upcoming election. Putin constantly implies conspiracy - like you mentioned - and always puts himself as reasonable and amicable. If only there was a man willing to make a deal? The deep-state bs expanded everywhere to NATO, media, etc. Putin never explicably saying so but always suggesting there are people unelected who make the 'real' decisions. It leads up nicely for carlson's inevitable long chat with trump; \"Putin said this.\" \"Oh yes, great guy, war's over tomora.\" It's hard to note a single talking point of Putin's during this that isn't completely aligned with trumps, it is trumps entire foreign policy strategy.\n\nPersonally:\nWhat I still find galling was carlson's inability to pushback on Putin's positioning of himself as only reactionary. It was certainly to be expected that Putin denies his own agency, he's always the passive-player acted on by others forcing his hand. NATO did this, what could we do? I was nice, they said no. Why do you keep making me hit you? :((( carlson doesn't even try to hold him to this. The worst part being when a straight answer - finally - comes through on the reason for invasion. Where we see Putin echo the same justification Hitler used to invade Poland and Czechslovakia in WW2: There were good russians being murdered and terrorised there, how could we not help? But again, this is important for the US audiences, many of whom are looking for reasons to stop Ukrainian aid.\n\nAlso carlson asking if Harris' visit to Ukraine before the invasion provoked the actual attack. Jaw drop moment of bad journalism.\n\nOther notes:\nBig surprise on the lack of 'corruption in Ukraine' talk. I thought that was gonna be heavy but apparently he wanted to lecture on why ukr doesn't exist, historically and conceptually. And ofc, even if there is a ukr identity, they're all nazis etc.\n\nHis messaging training was as professional as one could expect from Putin. But there were two moments I noticed the mask slip that I thought interesting. First, in his usual resentment for the 'previous russian leadership'. It is well known what Putin thinks of the USSRs leadership leading up to its fall, particularly Yeltsin. But, it is still quite amusing to see just how sore a point it is to him. The other and more interesting one was his resentment that post soviet Russia was not welcomed into the fold of the west. I'm unsure to be honest whether this was messaging or not, but it did stand out. Rare moment of emotion. He seemed imbittered that Russia was kept in the pariah state classification from the 90s onwards by the west. We're all aware of the efforts made, and Bill Browder saw the reality. It's more an interesting blindspot for Putin, he wanted Russia to be welcomed into the fold but all on its own terms, which isn't how globalisation really works. Having cakes and eating them.\n\nBoth those points just boil down to Putin's thought process that if he was in charge then, it would've all been hunky dory.\n\nThose were the messaging points I noticed he and the Krem wanted to proliferate, the big question now is will they stick? Too early to tell, but will be interesting to see how they fair until November really kicks off.\n\nOh and one last point was the return of the Canadian parliament debacle. I remember laughing at the time at how atrocious it was that it was allowed to happen. But also knew it would come back round again, it was perfect propaganda for the krem. Wondered why they didn't push it that often though. Guess we know what they were really saving it for now. Still rolled my eyes when they showed the clip.",

I thought that was gonna be heavy but apparently he wanted to lecture on why ukr doesn&#39;t exist, historically and conceptually. And ofc, even if there is a ukr identity, they&#39;re all nazis etc.</p>\n\n<p>His messaging training was as professional as one could expect from Putin. But there were two moments I noticed the mask slip that I thought interesting. First, in his usual resentment for the &#39;previous russian leadership&#39;. It is well known what Putin thinks of the USSRs leadership leading up to its fall, particularly Yeltsin. But, it is still quite amusing to see just how sore a point it is to him. The other and more interesting one was his resentment that post soviet Russia was not welcomed into the fold of the west. I&#39;m unsure to be honest whether this was messaging or not, but it did stand out. Rare moment of emotion. He seemed imbittered that Russia was kept in the pariah state classification from the 90s onwards by the west. We&#39;re all aware of the efforts made, and Bill Browder saw the reality. It&#39;s more an interesting blindspot for Putin, he wanted Russia to be welcomed into the fold but all on its own terms, which isn&#39;t how globalisation really works. Having cakes and eating them.</p>\n\n<p>Both those points just boil down to Putin&#39;s thought process that if he was in charge then, it would&#39;ve all been hunky dory.</p>\n\n<p>Those were the messaging points I noticed he and the Krem wanted to proliferate, the big question now is will they stick? Too early to tell, but will be interesting to see how they fair until November really kicks off.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and one last point was the return of the Canadian parliament debacle. I remember laughing at the time at how atrocious it was that it was allowed to happen. But also knew it would come back round again, it was perfect propaganda for the krem. Wondered why they didn&#39;t push it that often though. Guess we know what they were really saving it for now. Still rolled my eyes when they showed the clip.</p>\n</div>",

                        "body": "It's Shchedrovitsky's movement, which also inspired Kirienko (who worked on domestic politics and is now also curator of occupied territories), it's not really much of even a philosophical movement in a way, it's thinkers who worked on questions of thinking-acting link, how to think effectively and how to impact reality, theories of management, etc. From what I read about it, the most potentially damaging parts of it are the idea that society can be \"programmed\", that educators form the human of the future society, that legislators should adopt laws which condition humans to the necessary changes, that a strong ideology is needed to guide action, etc. but it's not necessarily very different from similar philosophical/behaviour sciences stuff in the West (except maybe that they tried to find the most effective ways to create change, rather than just writing about theory), and it's more often closer to general management stuff (how to make workers more effective, how to manage a crisis, etc). They are said to be quite present among \"political technologists,\" campaign organizers, etc, as well as in big business. Some have a conspirational reading about them but they were mostly working on the how to do the kind of stuff that political leaders and businessmen have always been doing/trying to do, at least from my understanding, although they didn't necessary see state control of people's thought processes as something bad, but as a prerequisite to a better future..\n\nThey are also a major influence behind the idea of \"Russian world\" in its modern acceptation, according to which Russia should expand its influence, Russians abroad are an extension of the state, that where they live can be seen as an extension of Russia, and that anyone who speaks Russian can and should be considered Russian. It's not a new idea in itself (or at least, parts of it have a long historical tradition), but they merged it into something practical and highlighted its pursuit as necessary to the restoration of Russia as a great power.

They are said to be quite present among &quot;political technologists,&quot; campaign organizers, etc, as well as in big business. Some have a conspirational reading about them but they were mostly working on the how to do the kind of stuff that political leaders and businessmen have always been doing/trying to do, at least from my understanding, although they didn&#39;t necessary see state control of people&#39;s thought processes as something bad, but as a prerequisite to a better future..</p>\n\n<p>They are also a major influence behind the idea of &quot;Russian world&quot; in its modern acceptation, according to which Russia should expand its influence, Russians abroad are an extension of the state, that where they live can be seen as an extension of Russia, and that anyone who speaks Russian can and should be considered Russian. It&#39;s not a new idea in itself (or at least, parts of it have a long historical tradition), but they merged it into something practical and highlighted its pursuit as necessary to the restoration of Russia as a great power. They started promoting this idea in the 1990s and it quickly caught on within the political actors they were working with.

Having set this goal coming into 2024, Ukraine feels the importance of secure locations for industry as no one else as it understands Russia can launch a long-range strike at any point on Ukrainian territory.*\n\n*Therefore, whether the goal of reaching a million drones is possible or not, partially depends on the configuration of the industrial complex. An interesting example of a working distributed manufacturing model is showcased by TAF Drones. This company aims to make 350,000 FPV drones this year, CEO Oleksandr Yakovenko told Defense Express in an interview hosted by Espreso TV channel.*\n\n*There is no particular place where the drones are assembled, Yakovenko says. The production is dispersed among 6 cities, some 12 industrial locations operate all at once, which change every 3 months. In other words, the production is not just distributed, it is both migrating and distributed.*\n\n*This strategy makes it extremely difficult for the enemy to pinpoint and strike down the industrial capacity of TAF Drones but requires top-notch cohesion because relocation once in a quarter has to be done smoothly without slowing down the manufacturing. Apart from that, such a \"nomadic\" lifestyle forces the company to view its capacity in a different light and make it more mobile and compact.*\n\n*Yakovenko told us that they in TAF Drones use the \"conveyor approach\" in production. It's not about literal automated assembly lines but a general approach to the process: each specialist has a narrow specialty and a specific production operation to do:*\n\n*\"Someone does the soldering, someone tightens the screws, someone adjusts the settings, someone carries out the testing, etc.,\" says the company chief and adds that this job allocation enables to get 7\u20138 drones done a day per employee.*\n\n*Besides making FPV drones, TAF Drones is finishing the development of a winged kamikaze UAV with a 4-kg payload and an operational range of 40 km. The main feature, though, is the low price: up to \u20b480,000, or a little above $2,000. According to the current plan, the deliveries of the new product will begin this March.*\n\n*The company is also working on the \"machine vision\" for their FPV drones but the cost of this upgrade is yet too high to be implemented on each unit. There is also a project on making a solid rocket with an attack range of up to 70 km in development.*\n\n[The Ministry of Digital Transformation Reveals Significant Results of Drone Army Project | Defense Express | February 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/the_ministry_of_digital_transformation_reveals_significant_results_of_drone_army_project-9448.html)\n\n*In July 2022, the collaborative efforts of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense, the State Special Communications Service and the Ministry of Digital Transformation, alongside the UNITED24 platform, led to the inception of the Drone Army project. Fast forward to March 2023, less than a year later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces welcomed the initial three variants of strike unmanned aerial systems. A recent article by [ArmyInform](https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/02/07/33-shkoly-67-rot-14-tysyach-czilej-shho-vstygla-armiya-droniv-za-rik-isnuvannya-proyektu/) delves into insights from the Ministry of Digital Transformation\u2019s report on the project\u2019s strides.*\n\n*Presently, the project boasts 67 operational strike squadrons. Their cumulative achievements since June 2023, when comprehensive data collection on damaged and neutralized targets commenced, amount to 15,140 hits. These encompass strikes on Russian weaponry, military assets, personnel and fortified positions. Noteworthy is the Ministry of Digital Transformation\u2019s revelation that drone operators have, on occasion, executed as many as 80 hits in a single night.*\n\n*Under the aegis of the Drone Army initiative, close to 20,000 UAV operators have undergone training, facilitated by 33 partner institutions, championing a \u201cmoney follows the military\u201d approach. Notably, the imperative for expanding operator training persists owing to the burgeoning deployment of strike and auxiliary drones within the Armed Forces of Ukraine.*\n\n*The Ministry of Digital Transformation underscores its commitment to catalyzing Ukraine\u2019s drone market growth through the enactment of revolutionary resolutions. Approximately 20 legislative and regulatory measures were streamlined to ease drone operations, abolishing redundant controls, while augmenting profit margins from 1% to 25%. Concurrently, fresh training and testing grounds were established, legislative hurdles impeding ammunition and component manufacturers were dismantled, and so forth. A stark contrast emerges when comparing the drone landscape from 2022, where only seven UAV models were eligible for state contracts, to the current tally of 67. Production has surged diversity, engaging nearly two hundred companies. Pertaining to drone ammunition manufacturing, reports indicate involvement from over 50 state and private entities, producing models spanning 300 grams to 10 kilograms.*\n\n[Ukrainian Military on Their Experience Operating the Rys Combat Robot | Defense Express | February 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/ukrainian_military_on_their_experience_operating_the_rys_combat_robot-9427.html)\n\n*The Tysk NIP community has posted a brief note of feedback from the Ukrainian military drone operators, who share their experience of working with the Rys (Lynx) unmanned ground vehicle for 3\u20134 months. The soldiers note that this wheeled versatile robotic platform is a \"splendid way to strengthen a unit\" and it has proved useful for setting up ambushes.*\n\n*On the downside, they suggest that the platform would benefit from bigger wheels or tracks in terms of all-terrain mobility and maneuverability: \"When operating the system, the main challenges are the landscape and line of sight for the robot itself, its utility as an element of fire support, and for covering the exfiltration routes,\" they say.*\n\n*The platform used by this unit was equipped with a weapon station utilizing a 7.62mm PKT machine gun. The operators say the system could be improved with a rotating camera with daytime thermal imagery and better zoom.*\n\n*Last year, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov announced a procurement of 5 Rys UGVs as part of the Army of Drones project, which were delivered to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.*",

Approximately 20 legislative and regulatory measures were streamlined to ease drone operations, abolishing redundant controls, while augmenting profit margins from 1% to 25%. Concurrently, fresh training and testing grounds were established, legislative hurdles impeding ammunition and component manufacturers were dismantled, and so forth. A stark contrast emerges when comparing the drone landscape from 2022, where only seven UAV models were eligible for state contracts, to the current tally of 67. Production has surged diversity, engaging nearly two hundred companies. Pertaining to drone ammunition manufacturing, reports indicate involvement from over 50 state and private entities, producing models spanning 300 grams to 10 kilograms.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/ukrainian_military_on_their_experience_operating_the_rys_combat_robot-9427.html\">Ukrainian Military on Their Experience Operating the Rys Combat Robot | Defense Express | February 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The Tysk NIP community has posted a brief note of feedback from the Ukrainian military drone operators, who share their experience of working with the Rys (Lynx) unmanned ground vehicle for 3\u20134 months. The soldiers note that this wheeled versatile robotic platform is a &quot;splendid way to strengthen a unit&quot; and it has proved useful for setting up ambushes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>On the downside, they suggest that the platform would benefit from bigger wheels or tracks in terms of all-terrain mobility and maneuverability: &quot;When operating the system, the main challenges are the landscape and line of sight for the robot itself, its utility as an element of fire support, and for covering the exfiltration routes,&quot; they say.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The platform used by this unit was equipped with a weapon station utilizing a 7.62mm PKT machine gun. The operators say the system could be improved with a rotating camera with daytime thermal imagery and better zoom.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Last year, Ukraine&#39;s Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov announced a procurement of 5 Rys UGVs as part of the Army of Drones project, which were delivered to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</em></p>\n</div>",

Often they will make no sense militarily, but that's because they're based on strategic commander's intent that didn't make any sense militarily.  \n\nFor example, look at Bakhmut. Troops complaining of being unable to retreat when they need to, not without orders from the highest levels often coming too late, that's a guarantee. Not being able to pick and choose where to situate their defenses, being forced to perform a rigid defense with no freedom to maneuver, that's a guarantee. Reinforcing defensive positions to replace casualties that were wiped out by enemy fires, only for reinforcements to be wiped out by fires, that's a guarantee. Feeding barely trained troops rushed into the line, inducted only weeks earlier, that's a guarantee. Etc.\n\nThere is no good way to follow very stupid strategic orders without major negative tactical implications. One either does their duty, knowing it's a mistake but doing it anyway, or they sabotage their boss's plan and try to undermine them by disobeying without being blatant about it. \n\nMany great \"captains of war\" shined during their careers by disobeying the orders of superiors to do things their way, which resulted in stunning victories. Less known historical military figures violated orders and still lost, and their names went down in history as both disloyal and incompetent. \n\nThen there are the guys who exist to follow orders, who will go down with the ship if told to, or anything else. Syrsky seems like the type of guy who follows orders to the T, like a good little boy, which he expects his soldiers to as well. He seems very much a product of his Soviet upbringing, military education, early military service, and the existing Soviet military culture that permeated the UAF since the Cold War ended, and why it's still considered by many to be a Soviet army. \n\nThese issues are why I have relentlessly ranted about the dangers of Zelensky micromanaging military affairs, because he's causing stuff like that to happen, he's putting officers in positions where they choose to obey and do their duty, or try to save their men and the war from the errors of their own leaders.",

Often they will make no sense militarily, but that&#39;s because they&#39;re based on strategic commander&#39;s intent that didn&#39;t make any sense militarily.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, look at Bakhmut. Troops complaining of being unable to retreat when they need to, not without orders from the highest levels often coming too late, that&#39;s a guarantee. Not being able to pick and choose where to situate their defenses, being forced to perform a rigid defense with no freedom to maneuver, that&#39;s a guarantee. Reinforcing defensive positions to replace casualties that were wiped out by enemy fires, only for reinforcements to be wiped out by fires, that&#39;s a guarantee. Feeding barely trained troops rushed into the line, inducted only weeks earlier, that&#39;s a guarantee. Etc.</p>\n\n<p>There is no good way to follow very stupid strategic orders without major negative tactical implications. One either does their duty, knowing it&#39;s a mistake but doing it anyway, or they sabotage their boss&#39;s plan and try to undermine them by disobeying without being blatant about it. </p>\n\n<p>Many great &quot;captains of war&quot; shined during their careers by disobeying the orders of superiors to do things their way, which resulted in stunning victories. Less known historical military figures violated orders and still lost, and their names went down in history as both disloyal and incompetent. </p>\n\n<p>Then there are the guys who exist to follow orders, who will go down with the ship if told to, or anything else. Syrsky seems like the type of guy who follows orders to the T, like a good little boy, which he expects his soldiers to as well. He seems very much a product of his Soviet upbringing, military education, early military service, and the existing Soviet military culture that permeated the UAF since the Cold War ended, and why it&#39;s still considered by many to be a Soviet army. </p>\n\n<p>These issues are why I have relentlessly ranted about the dangers of Zelensky micromanaging military affairs, because he&#39;s causing stuff like that to happen, he&#39;s putting officers in positions where they choose to obey and do their duty, or try to save their men and the war from the errors of their own leaders.</p>\n</div>",

Stealth doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018magical invisibility cloak\u2019 to make a big difference on the battlefield. Small things like delaying acquisition and shortening detection ranges make a big difference to survivability. </p>\n\n<p>It also pairs very well with EW.</p>\n</div>",

The pieces on the chessboard are clear in his mind. But the bottom line sounds ominous: \u201cThe Russians are trying to seize the initiative, so the situation is really difficult.\u201d\n\n>None of this was unexpected, says Syrskyi, who was born in Vladimir, then in the Soviet Union and now in Russia. While some in the Ukrainian military may find comfort in traducing the Russian war effort, enjoying some of the indiscipline and mutiny shared on social media, he describes the situation largely without any such complicating emotion.\n\n>\u201cWe must not underestimate the enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe enemy has anticipated and continues to anticipate the most dangerous directions of our movements, and builds up strong defences there that are quite difficult to penetrate.\u201d\n\n>\u201cAnd the third factor is detailed planning of all our operations and action \u2013 very detailed preparation. The planning shows how well we have studied the peculiarities of the theatre of action, how well we are using the topographical features. Of course, we see the enemy\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and we must take all of that into account.\u201d\n\n>Syrskyi is a history buff and his own recent past makes good reading. In the battle for Kyiv, he explains that a turning point was when Russian marines, paratroopers and special forces were approaching the village of Moshchun, just to the north-west of the capital. Ukrainian troops had blown up the bridges crossing the Irpin River as they had retreated but Moshchun remained a gateway.\n\n>Has Syrskyi seen a way through this time? He is understandably cagey. \u201cWell, this is an ongoing process \u2013 the process of searching,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone keeps learning, the enemy does and so do we. We can see all the time how the enemy is changing its tactics. If you take [the Russian private mercenary group] Wagner as an example, I could tell you exactly how they adjusted their tactics, when at first they moved units to storm our positions they were the size of company or a detachment and how later they spread their troops thinner and changed their arrangements \u2026 Everyone draws their conclusions, and no one wants to get fooled the same way twice.\u201d\n\n>Syrskyi is described by his closest aides as \u201ca military man through and through\u201d. He is said to rise at 5.20am to do an hour of exercise before the working day and to have little interest in material things. \u201cI sleep four and a half hours a night,\u201d he says. And before the full scale war? \u201cMaybe five hours,\u201d he laughs. \u201cFive and a half on Sunday.\u201d He is known to take photographs of sunsets when he makes his weekly visits to the frontlines and he shares them with colleagues. He still finds time to read, although it is something of a busman\u2019s holiday: on the bedside table at the moment are works by the Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, reading [the Greek philosopher] Plutarch and other authors, and watching documentaries about ancient Greek history, they use the same war principles as we do in our time,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the main principles of war stay the same. When you read about the battle of Cannae, between Hannibal and the Romans [in 216 BC], the principles at work are the same: flanking the enemy, surrounding the enemy, concentrating the central effort at the enemy\u2019s weakest point of defence, the need to study the enemy carefully. Nothing has changed. OK, maybe the sophistication of equipment has changed and the degree to which processes are automated.\u201d\n\n[The economist who everyone is quoting today](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/08/who-is-oleksandr-syrsky-the-head-of-ukraines-ground-forces)\n\n>General Syrsky was born in 1965 in Vladimir, then in the Soviet Union, now in Russia. He has lived in Ukraine since the 1980s. Like most people of his age in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces he trained at the Higher Military Command School in Moscow, the Soviet Union\u2019s equivalent of America\u2019s West Point, alongside peers who are now Russian commanders. Before becoming head of Ukraine\u2019s land forces in 2019 he was the ground commander for operations in the east of the country and played a prominent role in the war that began in 2014 with Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. He was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, which is given for \u201cexceptional duty in defence of state sovereignty and state security\u201d.\n\n>Colleagues describe the general as ascetic, with an addiction to gym. He is said to be an obsessive planner. Some Western analysts say that his battle tactics reflect his hierarchical Soviet training. But his operational flexibility differentiates his approach from that of Russian generals. He preaches NATO principles of decentralised command, learned during a stint in Brussels in 2013, where he met representatives of the alliance to discuss how to modernise Ukraine\u2019s forces. He emphasises the importance of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d. And he prioritises his troops\u2019 morale: every day he reads messages from hundreds of soldiers and he regularly visits them in the field. \u201cYou must feel the spirit of the army,\u201d he says. \n\n>Many of Ukraine\u2019s victories since the Russian invasion in February 2022 can be attributed to General Syrsky. That month, as Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops massed on the border, the general ordered military hardware to be moved off bases, so the kit would not be destroyed by airstrikes in the event of war. While Mr Zelensky was playing down the risk of an attack on the capital, Kyiv, General Syrsky was preparing for one. Two rings of defence were constructed around the city, and its borders were divided between generals who were authorised to make tactical decisions. When Kyiv came under threat in March 2022 a dam on the Irpin river was blown up to flood the Russian positions and destroy their pontoon bridge in order to prevent them from approaching the city. The invaders retreated. (The destruction of the Kakhova dam on the Dnieper river on June 6th this year, believed to have been carried out by Russia, caused much wider devastation and will make it harder for Ukrainian troops to move eastward.) In April 2022 General Syrsky was made a Hero of Ukraine, the country\u2019s highest honour.",

A long attritional struggle plays right into the Union's hands: that was their highly publicized war plan and they had the material for it. From a pragmatic perspective I think it was also unlikely to work just because the South's necessary confidence to think could take the Union precluded a strategy of sitting there doing nothing. Jabs to this effect in the press were exactly what caused Lee to change his entire attitude in the first place.\n\n> Just because you make it to the line doesn't mean you're doing so with enough force to break through or exploit it. \n\nOf course! But these kinds of events aren't suggestive of a force so degraded by incoming fire that it was ineffective. No matter the terrain they would be getting shot from 20 meters away. And bayonet combat was exceptionally rare, requiring the utmost confidence and strength of numbers on both sides. \n\nWould they have succeeded if they approached through woods or broken ground instead? We can only guess, but I think the failed attacks at Little Round Top and Culp's Hill suggest perhaps not.\n\n> It was obvious to his aides at the time that the attack would fail\n\nTo some of his soldiers, most famously Longstreet, yes. To others, most famously Pickett, no. Faced with conflicting advice we should consider Lee's reply: his army had done it before. And he was right, it certainly had. \n\nHis attacks into the broken ground of the enemy's flanks had failed, but earlier he had swept the Union out of the open at the Peach Orchard in a combined infantry and artillery attack. That morning the chief of Confederate artillery, William Pendleton, assessed that the Union's center was weak as a result and Lee agreed. He could repeat an attack on the Union center with some expectation of success.\n\nEven if he believed Fredericksburg was the unique province of Yankees he had been at Malvern Hill and seen what happened to his own infantry attacking head-on unsupported. He had won the Seven Days in the end despite that mistake, this time he wouldn't repeat his error or the error of the Yankees at Antietam or Fredericksburg. He'd engage the whole enemy perimeter simultaneously with a large distraction, and only proceed with the main attack after it had been sufficiently prepared by artillery.\n\nThe fighting at Culp's Hill was audible so the distraction was clearly underway. And considering the damage sustained by the Confederate batteries in the artillery duel the Confederate officers judged the enemy batteries had been destroyed when they fell silent. And the more you believe the Confederate attack was actually damaged by Union artillery over the open approach the stronger a signal this should have been to proceed with the attack since it was apparently out of action. \n\nIt was the very reasonableness of this fact that made the deliberate ruse by the Union's chief of artillery so effective, and it's just one in a long list of reasons for the attack's eventual failure which include Meade's prescience and coolness; Pickett suggesting it in the first place; the inaccurate assessments of the Confederate artillery officers, their poor aim, their defective ammunition; and the fact that many Union soldiers chose to fight and hold the line when some of their comrades hadn't.\n\nAll of these parties, and more, deserve their share of praise and blame for the effect they had on the failure of the attack.

                                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>One could provide a counter narrative that termerity might have been the best long term strategic approach, given Union advantages in manpower and material.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve thought this myself at times but I&#39;m not sure it would be a better idea. A long attritional struggle plays right into the Union&#39;s hands: that was their highly publicized war plan and they had the material for it. From a pragmatic perspective I think it was also unlikely to work just because the South&#39;s necessary confidence to think could take the Union precluded a strategy of sitting there doing nothing. Jabs to this effect in the press were exactly what caused Lee to change his entire attitude in the first place.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just because you make it to the line doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re doing so with enough force to break through or exploit it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course! But these kinds of events aren&#39;t suggestive of a force so degraded by incoming fire that it was ineffective. No matter the terrain they would be getting shot from 20 meters away. And bayonet combat was exceptionally rare, requiring the utmost confidence and strength of numbers on both sides. </p>\n\n<p>Would they have succeeded if they approached through woods or broken ground instead? We can only guess, but I think the failed attacks at Little Round Top and Culp&#39;s Hill suggest perhaps not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was obvious to his aides at the time that the attack would fail</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To some of his soldiers, most famously Longstreet, yes. To others, most famously Pickett, no. Faced with conflicting advice we should consider Lee&#39;s reply: his army had done it before. And he was right, it certainly had. </p>\n\n<p>His attacks into the broken ground of the enemy&#39;s flanks had failed, but earlier he had swept the Union out of the open at the Peach Orchard in a combined infantry and artillery attack. That morning the chief of Confederate artillery, William Pendleton, assessed that the Union&#39;s center was weak as a result and Lee agreed. He could repeat an attack on the Union center with some expectation of success.</p>\n\n<p>Even if he believed Fredericksburg was the unique province of Yankees he had been at Malvern Hill and seen what happened to his own infantry attacking head-on unsupported. He had won the Seven Days in the end despite that mistake, this time he wouldn&#39;t repeat his error or the error of the Yankees at Antietam or Fredericksburg. He&#39;d engage the whole enemy perimeter simultaneously with a large distraction, and only proceed with the main attack after it had been sufficiently prepared by artillery.</p>\n\n<p>The fighting at Culp&#39;s Hill was audible so the distraction was clearly underway. And considering the damage sustained by the Confederate batteries in the artillery duel the Confederate officers judged the enemy batteries had been destroyed when they fell silent. And the more you believe the Confederate attack was actually damaged by Union artillery over the open approach the stronger a signal this should have been to proceed with the attack since it was apparently out of action. </p>\n\n<p>It was the very reasonableness of this fact that made the deliberate ruse by the Union&#39;s chief of artillery so effective, and it&#39;s just one in a long list of reasons for the attack&#39;s eventual failure which include Meade&#39;s prescience and coolness; Pickett suggesting it in the first place; the inaccurate assessments of the Confederate artillery officers, their poor aim, their defective ammunition; and the fact that many Union soldiers chose to fight and hold the line when some of their comrades hadn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>All of these parties, and more, deserve their share of praise and blame for the effect they had on the failure of the attack. If we act like its failure was predetermined when a senile Lee forgot what frontal infantry attacks looked like and was the sole irrational man among a sea of rationality we lose the rest of that truth.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note I&#39;m not saying that Lee was overall a bad general, but in the overall pantheon of historical commanders he was decidedly mid rather than &quot;brilliant.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having said all that, I also don&#39;t think Lee was brilliant.

Shortage of willing conscripts and volunteers to serve\n\nSimply put, conscription has never been popular in Ukraine, it's not popular especially now, those who are of age, physical, mental requirements to serve who want to serve already signed up. \n\n3. The demand for conscripts has never been higher\n\nSimply put, if they want to win this war they need to replace losses, discharge veterans, while also still expanding. Soon they are potentially going to have their higher conscription demand yet. \n\nThere are no simple solutions for these, or popular ones, or cheap ones. There is no single piece of legislation pending or even a plan to fix them. Nor will there be, because there doesn't seem to be a real fix for them that is realistic.\n\nThe easiest solution is to offer lavish bonuses and pay increases to incentive people to serve, while throwing money at them as benefits if they're casualties or even just for serving. Russia is doing it now, the US did it during the GWOT, Ancient Rome did it during unpopular wars, etc. It works, but it's VERY expensive. \n\nUkraine can't afford to do it themselves, and even if the US was helping now as much as they did in 2023, between them and what the EU typically gives they'll still not come close to what that plan would require. The way things are going, it's very unlikely they'll find the money for that. \n\nBecause there are no realistic ways to solve those problems, there is no plan.

Soon they are potentially going to have their higher conscription demand yet. </p>\n\n<p>There are no simple solutions for these, or popular ones, or cheap ones. There is no single piece of legislation pending or even a plan to fix them. Nor will there be, because there doesn&#39;t seem to be a real fix for them that is realistic.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest solution is to offer lavish bonuses and pay increases to incentive people to serve, while throwing money at them as benefits if they&#39;re casualties or even just for serving. Russia is doing it now, the US did it during the GWOT, Ancient Rome did it during unpopular wars, etc. It works, but it&#39;s VERY expensive. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine can&#39;t afford to do it themselves, and even if the US was helping now as much as they did in 2023, between them and what the EU typically gives they&#39;ll still not come close to what that plan would require. The way things are going, it&#39;s very unlikely they&#39;ll find the money for that. </p>\n\n<p>Because there are no realistic ways to solve those problems, there is no plan.

That's why there is an urgency to do something immediately. \n\nThe best solution is don't try to solve everything immediately with the perfect answer, just act.

Israel has just completely failed to do that.\n\nThe key word here is \"peace\" and, for the purposes of this statement, it can simply mean relative quiet or calm rather than \"real\" peace. A good example of this is the most recent insurgency in Israel/Palestine - the Second Intifada. It ended not with a peace agreement, but with Israel gradually dismantling the Palestinian ability to launch attacks (suicide bombings) in Israel. Eventually Palestinians realized they had suffered a lot in terms of low-grade warfare while not achieving anything politically. It is unclear to what extent Palestinians decided to stop conducting attacks, as opposed to Israel thwarting those attacks, but either way the West Bank became pretty quiet for many years. Similar results could be expected in Gaza, where the population has already suffered much more, and (so far) the attacks have not been rewarded with substantial political gains.",

A good example of this is the most recent insurgency in Israel/Palestine - the Second Intifada. It ended not with a peace agreement, but with Israel gradually dismantling the Palestinian ability to launch attacks (suicide bombings) in Israel. Eventually Palestinians realized they had suffered a lot in terms of low-grade warfare while not achieving anything politically. It is unclear to what extent Palestinians decided to stop conducting attacks, as opposed to Israel thwarting those attacks, but either way the West Bank became pretty quiet for many years. Similar results could be expected in Gaza, where the population has already suffered much more, and (so far) the attacks have not been rewarded with substantial political gains.</p>\n</div>",

They&#39;ve got more aid in the last 30 years than European countries got to rebuild after WW2 as part of the Marshal plan. A significant part of it from Israel. Just UNWRA was getting $1.3 a year directly. Other Palestinian aid orgs were getting about another $1bn total. Power, water, fuel, internet and more were provided to Gaza for free.</p>\n\n<p>The aid, specifically to Gaza, was so extreme that most of the Gaza population didn&#39;t work yet had a better standard of living than the average citized on Jordan, Egypt and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Tibet, again you skip over the part where any resistance was consistently crushed with extreme force. The money China pumped into Tibet was nothing exceptional.</p>\n\n<p>The PKK was absolutely crushed by large scale destruction. Remember this is within Turkey, done to Turkish citizens in areas under full Turkish control. It would have been similar to Israeli actions against Israeli Arabs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>UN Accuses Turkey of Massive Destruction, Torture in Kurdish Areas</p>\n\n<p>During that period, the report says government security operations displaced between 355,000 and one-half-million, mainly Kurdish people in more than 30 towns and neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>The report describes the destruction of buildings in some villages. In one area, local authorities estimate 70 percent of the buildings were systematically destroyed by shelling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/un-accuses-turkey-massive-destruction-killings-torture-kurdish-areas/3760288.html\">https://www.voanews.com/a/un-accuses-turkey-massive-destruction-killings-torture-kurdish-areas/3760288.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/4369374/turkey-hidden-war/\">https://time.com/4369374/turkey-hidden-war/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/8fiyNMeiZ9n4MxCG8\">https://images.app.goo.gl/8fiyNMeiZ9n4MxCG8</a></p>\n\n<p>The common thread is that Israel is traditionally not as brutal as those who have successfully destroyed insurgencies.</p>\n</div>",

However, if they had a sane plan, Kyiv wouldn't have been threatened because the Russians couldn't have launched a successful broad front offensive, using pretty much every inland road from Belarus to the Russian border to Crimea with the force structure they possessed. \n\nWhich was actually a large reason the UAF were caught so unaware, while Zal. and the rest of the top UAF brass foolishly unprepared, they were so because they didn't think it made sense. An invasion to cut off the Donbas? Yes, that made sense. A broad front invasion of basically everywhere, especially against Kyiv? That didn't make sense, so they didn't plan to counter it. \n\nIt wasn't until the day before when their intelligence services finally picked up the last bits of intel, a mix of HUMINT, SIGINT and IMINT, that absolutely 100% showed the Russian invasion was imminent that they finally acted. A few military units, especially mobile air defenses had time to move. A few UAF maneuver brigades made it out of their garrison bases fearing they'd be hit (most weren't), Zelensky ordered the mobilization of reserves, etc. But it was all rather too late still.  \n\nNorth of Kyiv on the western side of the Dnieper, the Belarus-Ukraine border is one giant swamp, the Pripet Marshes. South of the border there are three east-west rivers that are tributaries of the Dnieper. All of that means that the Russians were extremely road bound, driving on a limited number of roads requiring them to cross a limited number of bridges. While the UAF could have defended close to the border but outside Russian artillery range set up in Belarus, they were nowhere close. A single brigade was located southwest of the city and only parts of one of its battalions managed to reach Ivankiv, which was respectively 65 km and 73 km away from the border, and weren't strong enough to hold it, requiring them to retreat until they reached the Irpin River, which is part of the suburbs of Kyiv, the operational location of later battles of Bucha, Irpin, Moschun, etc. \n\nKofman specifically mentions that for the better part of a week there were no UAF defenses to the west of the city, which means if the Russians had bypassed the Bucha defenses and continued on to E40 highway, there would have been nothing to stop them. By the time the Russians figured out that route was totally open and they started to move there, more UAF reinforcements were rushed to the Kyiv region and managed to stop them, as well as armed volunteers thrown into militia/TDF units manning the front line arm and arm with UAF units. \n\nI'm not trying to belittle the defense of Kyiv, it really was miraculous. But I definitely don't think the UAF top brass did a very good job other than recovering a fumbled football that they dropped already multiple times.",

It might provide the officers but why would they control who is inducted into the Marines, Air Assault Forces, TDF, etc? </p>\n\n<p>Either way, the military recruiters still serve in the UAF, which Zaluzhny controlled. He had full power over them and their TTPs. Like pressganging recruits. Or corruption. </p>\n\n<p>Why did Zelensky fire all those military officers in August? Why didn&#39;t Zaluzhny? Why didn&#39;t Syrsky? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until recently, the head of the Ukrainian Ground Forces was Syrskyi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is exactly what  I mean when I say the shit don&#39;t stick to Zaluzhny. You blame Zelensky and Syrsky, but skipped Zaluzhny. </p>\n\n<p>What exactly about him inspires so much trust and confidence for you?</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine was already heavily involved in drones before he took command. They were already teamed with NATO and being trained by NATO militaries and adopting a few reforms when he took over. He didn't change organization. He didn't change tactics. He didn't change doctrine.

The Russo-Ukraine War is going to be won with foreign support, and some Zaluzhny created a persona that was highly successfully at engaging with the West.

If he wanted to boost his popularity, he could have made public the things he was working on, but he never did.\n\nZaluzhny was EXTREMELY public, just not in Western media.\n\nHe possessed and posted daily on his personal accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram, where he not only wrote posts but would also comment on other people's posts and have discussions with them. He only recently stopped, and only because he was getting in trouble for it.\n\nAnd when I say he posted daily, I don't mean like how politicians or other important figures have accounts and \"post\" on them when its obviously a staffer because they are too busy or probably don't even know how to use a smart phone. I mean Zaluzhny was a social media junky, has been since it became a thing, gained popularity because of that, regularly would joke with and converse with average joe soldiers in the UAF, etc.\n\nThere is a popular trend happening in the US military too regarding that. Smart, young, \"hip\" officers that fully embrace social media who are making themselves into popular memes with [stunts like this](https://twitter.com/ChowdahHill/status/1746729526388764864), which are endearing them to the junior enlisted troops, especially at times where others stand out for screwups exacerbated by their exposure on social media. More and more this new modern world is revealing that those who can succeed in improving their social media imagine will get ahead, regardless of anything else.\n\nFFS, how do you think Zelensky got elected? The entire premise of his TV show is a school teacher who made a rant about UA govt corruption and incompetence that went viral on social media, leading him to get elected. Zelensky took that and ran on his persona and got elected. The guy lives on his phone, 3/4 of his addresses to the Ukraine people are shot as selfies with his cell phone.\n\nMeanwhile, Zaluzhny embraced social media similarly, and what do you know? Despite being more junior than most of his peers, and having no real standout assignments or medals for valor associated with successful combat commands in the Donbas, etc, Zaluzhny was personally picked by Zelensky, someone who understands the value of social media, to be the C-in-C of the UAF.\n\nAnd then when Zaluzhny's popularity (despite largely related purely to social media) outshines Zelensky, aka he trends better, their relationship takes a shit.\n\nThat wasn't a coincidence.",

If he wanted to boost his popularity, he could have made public the things he was working on, but he never did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zaluzhny was EXTREMELY public, just not in Western media.</p>\n\n<p>He possessed and posted daily on his personal accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram, where he not only wrote posts but would also comment on other people&#39;s posts and have discussions with them. He only recently stopped, and only because he was getting in trouble for it.</p>\n\n<p>And when I say he posted daily, I don&#39;t mean like how politicians or other important figures have accounts and &quot;post&quot; on them when its obviously a staffer because they are too busy or probably don&#39;t even know how to use a smart phone. I mean Zaluzhny was a social media junky, has been since it became a thing, gained popularity because of that, regularly would joke with and converse with average joe soldiers in the UAF, etc.</p>\n\n<p>There is a popular trend happening in the US military too regarding that. Smart, young, &quot;hip&quot; officers that fully embrace social media who are making themselves into popular memes with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChowdahHill/status/1746729526388764864\">stunts like this</a>, which are endearing them to the junior enlisted troops, especially at times where others stand out for screwups exacerbated by their exposure on social media. More and more this new modern world is revealing that those who can succeed in improving their social media imagine will get ahead, regardless of anything else.</p>\n\n<p>FFS, how do you think Zelensky got elected? The entire premise of his TV show is a school teacher who made a rant about UA govt corruption and incompetence that went viral on social media, leading him to get elected. Zelensky took that and ran on his persona and got elected. The guy lives on his phone, 3/4 of his addresses to the Ukraine people are shot as selfies with his cell phone.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Zaluzhny embraced social media similarly, and what do you know? Despite being more junior than most of his peers, and having no real standout assignments or medals for valor associated with successful combat commands in the Donbas, etc, Zaluzhny was personally picked by Zelensky, someone who understands the value of social media, to be the C-in-C of the UAF.</p>\n\n<p>And then when Zaluzhny&#39;s popularity (despite largely related purely to social media) outshines Zelensky, aka he trends better, their relationship takes a shit.</p>\n\n<p>That wasn&#39;t a coincidence.</p>\n</div>",

It saw itself as the defender of Islam, Muslim land and the \"Ummah\" everywhere. It had the biggest military and the only Muslim country with nukes. So naturally it was in a difficult position to back the \"western infidels\" while still be seen as supporting the Islamic cause. The other big topic you can never get away from whenever discussing Pakistan is India. Pakistan had just suffered a humiliating defeat in a war with India in 1999. Pakistan was doing exactly what Iran is doing now...using proxy terrorist groups against India. Beyond that tho you have to look at who were the two most powerful positions in Pakistan at that time. Musharraf was the President and he had also been the General in charge of Kargil who came into power after a coup. Even tho he was a strongman there is another institution in Pakistan which has always held the real power which is the ISI. The ISI not only supported various Islamic terror groups it has always seen, to this day, its own survival as based on its proxy groups. If they lose the ability to use the various fanatical groups to direct attacks against India then there is a real risk of them losing their relevance and power. Between those two groups, the presidency which controlled the army and the ISI, you had a real struggle to maintain Pakistan's stated pro American role with what was the mood of the country as a whole. \n\nFun fact - no Pakistani PM has ever completed their 5 year term. The country has no political stability so every political decision Pakistan makes should be seen in the face of this fact.",

To be direct, election of a President Romney wouldn't have made the \"Tea Party feel like it was in control\".\n\nA big part of the worldview/motivation for Tea Party supporters has been dissatisfaction with establishment Republicans, such as the two Bush administrations. Many of the earliest electoral successes tied to the Tea Party movement were defeating establishment - sometimes incumbent - Republicans in primaries. (Tea Party-aligned candidates then tended to fare poorly in Senate races, but had more success in 2010 House races.)\n\nA big galvanizing event for the Tea Party was the bailouts (especially of large financial institutions) tied to the 2008/9 financial crisis. The Tea Party also initially developed around the longstanding tensions between libertarian-ish/small government Republicans and what are traditionally called \"country club/establishment\" Republicans. Romney (career as a private equity executive) has a lot of association, both politically and in his business background, with the latter group.\n\nOpposition to the ACA (\"Obamacare\") kept the Tea Party movement going/growing. Illegal immigration/border control has been another issue. And there are tendencies toward \"Jacksonian\" skepticism/isolationism on U.S. foreign policy within the Tea Party movement, with the Iraq War a major point of dissatisfaction with the Republican \"establishment\".\n\nSo it's a mix of various, not wholly philosophically consistent, issues. (As tends to be the case with any real world political movement.) A unifying theme, however, is dissatisfaction expressed as the view that on certain issues there's a \"Washington D.C. party\" where neither elected Democrats nor elected (establishment) Republicans are in line with the views of Tea Party supporters.

                                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Very doubtful analysis, imho. To be direct, election of a President Romney wouldn&#39;t have made the &quot;Tea Party feel like it was in control&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>A big part of the worldview/motivation for Tea Party supporters has been dissatisfaction with establishment Republicans, such as the two Bush administrations. Many of the earliest electoral successes tied to the Tea Party movement were defeating establishment - sometimes incumbent - Republicans in primaries. (Tea Party-aligned candidates then tended to fare poorly in Senate races, but had more success in 2010 House races.)</p>\n\n<p>A big galvanizing event for the Tea Party was the bailouts (especially of large financial institutions) tied to the 2008/9 financial crisis. The Tea Party also initially developed around the longstanding tensions between libertarian-ish/small government Republicans and what are traditionally called &quot;country club/establishment&quot; Republicans. Romney (career as a private equity executive) has a lot of association, both politically and in his business background, with the latter group.</p>\n\n<p>Opposition to the ACA (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) kept the Tea Party movement going/growing. Illegal immigration/border control has been another issue. And there are tendencies toward &quot;Jacksonian&quot; skepticism/isolationism on U.S. foreign policy within the Tea Party movement, with the Iraq War a major point of dissatisfaction with the Republican &quot;establishment&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s a mix of various, not wholly philosophically consistent, issues. (As tends to be the case with any real world political movement.) A unifying theme, however, is dissatisfaction expressed as the view that on certain issues there&#39;s a &quot;Washington D.C. party&quot; where neither elected Democrats nor elected (establishment) Republicans are in line with the views of Tea Party supporters. The critique has its analog on the left among supporters of Sanders (and previously Kucinich). The proposed policies to replace what&#39;s viewed as &quot;establishment&quot; of course tend to be very different, though on foreign policy there is often overlap.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "It\u2019s clear as day that UAVs have replaced artillery shells for Ukraine but there are no real clear numbers as the making of them is very decentralized. [The journal has an article with the best source on it yet along with Russian tactics at the front.](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraine-rations-munitions-as-end-of-u-s-aid-looms-russia-inches-forward-42b9462c) Utterly impressive by the Ukrainians to hold off this level of intensity with every material disadvantage possible. \n\n\n>A Ukrainian sniper listening in on a Russian radio channel heard how. The Russians had deployed a special trench-digging team typically made up of drunks and other ne\u2019er-do-wells. When one refused to dig, one Russian officer reported, the laggard was swiftly dealt with: \u201cWe eliminated him.\u201d\n\n>The advance had no immediate strategic impact, but it shows how Russian troops are slowly pressing forward using a critical advantage: masses of poorly trained conscripts and indifference to the loss of life.\n\n\n>Ukrainian troops are disadvantaged amid shortages of all kinds of equipment even before the consequences of Republicans blocking additional aid to Kyiv fully affect the battlefield. The most immediately painful shortage is in artillery: Russian forces are outshooting Ukrainians by about 10 Russian shells to every one they fire, a Ukrainian security official said.\n\n> The scarcity of shells, missiles and rockets is impeding Ukrainian efforts to hold back waves of Russian armored vehicles, troops and artillery. Ukraine is improvising by using explosive drones to take out armored columns. But Russian ground troops still manage to slip through, despite taking heavy casualties, allowing Moscow\u2019s forces to press forward.\n\n>\u201cThey are taking bites,\u201d the Ukrainian security official said.\n\n\u2026\n> Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency said last week it had used naval drones to destroy a Russian missile corvette off occupied Crimea. Ukrainian drone attacks have severely curtailed the movements of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet and allowed Kyiv to increase exports from its main southern port of Odesa to close to prewar levels.\n\n\u2026\n\n> Ukraine has given priority to hitting targets that can have maximum impact, such as Russian air bases from where attacks are launched, and fuel refineries or supplies far behind front lines.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s clear as day that UAVs have replaced artillery shells for Ukraine but there are no real clear numbers as the making of them is very decentralized. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraine-rations-munitions-as-end-of-u-s-aid-looms-russia-inches-forward-42b9462c\">The journal has an article with the best source on it yet along with Russian tactics at the front.</a> Utterly impressive by the Ukrainians to hold off this level of intensity with every material disadvantage possible. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Ukrainian sniper listening in on a Russian radio channel heard how. The Russians had deployed a special trench-digging team typically made up of drunks and other ne\u2019er-do-wells. When one refused to dig, one Russian officer reported, the laggard was swiftly dealt with: \u201cWe eliminated him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The advance had no immediate strategic impact, but it shows how Russian troops are slowly pressing forward using a critical advantage: masses of poorly trained conscripts and indifference to the loss of life.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian troops are disadvantaged amid shortages of all kinds of equipment even before the consequences of Republicans blocking additional aid to Kyiv fully affect the battlefield. The most immediately painful shortage is in artillery: Russian forces are outshooting Ukrainians by about 10 Russian shells to every one they fire, a Ukrainian security official said.</p>\n\n<p>The scarcity of shells, missiles and rockets is impeding Ukrainian efforts to hold back waves of Russian armored vehicles, troops and artillery. Ukraine is improvising by using explosive drones to take out armored columns. But Russian ground troops still manage to slip through, despite taking heavy casualties, allowing Moscow\u2019s forces to press forward.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey are taking bites,\u201d the Ukrainian security official said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u2026</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency said last week it had used naval drones to destroy a Russian missile corvette off occupied Crimea. Ukrainian drone attacks have severely curtailed the movements of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet and allowed Kyiv to increase exports from its main southern port of Odesa to close to prewar levels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u2026</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine has given priority to hitting targets that can have maximum impact, such as Russian air bases from where attacks are launched, and fuel refineries or supplies far behind front lines. The goal is to undermine Moscow\u2019s ability to wage war, and not just hit groups of troops. Kyiv hopes the approach will be more cost-effective than targeting front-line soldiers and may buy some breathing room for Ukrainian soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBy hitting targets at depth, you are relieving troops at the front,\u201d said retired German Lt.
