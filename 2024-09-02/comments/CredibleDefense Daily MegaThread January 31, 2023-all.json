A rocket PGK should be easier to engineer than one for tube artillery because 1) rockets are subjected to much lower acceleration than tube artillery, so less hardened electronics are required, 2) they are not fired through a rifled barrel, 3) they travel slower so there's more time for control surfaces to direct the rocket at its target. And Grad warheads are larger than or comparable to those of 155 and 152mm shells.\n\nM1156 PGKs reportedly cost as little as $10k, and if mass produced a 122mm rocket PGK should cost even less. Even if it's a bit costlier, it's still easily cheap enough to use against tactical targets. I'd think it would be possible to input targets without needing a new launcher as well. As far as I can tell, [Rafael's EPIK](https://www.rafael.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EPIK.pdf) is the only bolt on kit developed for 122mm rockets.

A rocket PGK should be easier to engineer than one for tube artillery because 1) rockets are subjected to much lower acceleration than tube artillery, so less hardened electronics are required, 2) they are not fired through a rifled barrel, 3) they travel slower so there&#39;s more time for control surfaces to direct the rocket at its target. And Grad warheads are larger than or comparable to those of 155 and 152mm shells.</p>\n\n<p>M1156 PGKs reportedly cost as little as $10k, and if mass produced a 122mm rocket PGK should cost even less. Even if it&#39;s a bit costlier, it&#39;s still easily cheap enough to use against tactical targets. I&#39;d think it would be possible to input targets without needing a new launcher as well. As far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://www.rafael.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EPIK.pdf\">Rafael&#39;s EPIK</a> is the only bolt on kit developed for 122mm rockets. It also boasts a 50% range increase but doesn&#39;t seem to have been purchased by anyone.</p>\n</div>",

First, they must pick up and move EVERYTHING, including their artillery and all the ammo (and remember, the Russians are not very mobile anymore). Then they must send ISR to find the defensive positions.

But there was no one battle that did that, definitely not Severondonetsk.\n\nBecause Russia didn't have an effective manpower replacement system before September, relying its shitshow Shadow Mobilization, they couldn't make up for the losses they sustained on the offensive April-August or losses in the first phase, or that most units showed up to Ukraine undermanned. Which meant most Russian combat units, theater wide, were dramatically undermanned by September. Some also argue they also used up a lot of their ammunition by that point, which also weakened their future force posture. But neither of those \"allowed for the Balakiya breakthrough later.\"\n\nRussia's overall front line in Ukraine, even if its combat units were at full strength, was TOO LARGE. They should have had a force of 2-3x, minimum, to hold that line. That situation was made worse in mid July when the UA govt started publicly baiting the strategic counteroffensive in \"the South,\" meaning Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts (which was not a faint). Because Putin wanted to hold onto those areas, the MOD had to reinforce them. To get the troops to reinforce the South they shifted them away from the East, which happened by transferring the Eastern Military District along with about 25x motor rifle, tank, and VDV battalions, most of their VDV brigades and divisions, to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.\n\nBy robbing Peter to pay Paul, they left a giant opening on their front lines from Balakiya to west of Izyum largely bare of troops. With paramilitary units holding extended frontages, with LDNR rear area security units, with Russian units that were between 25-50% manpower, no real tactical or operational reserve nearby, because they didn't think the UAF would attack there. They miscalculated, just like making a very poor chess move.\n\nThat had nothing to do with Severondonetsk, which was a battle largely fought between LDNR and Chechens on the Russian side and TDF on the Ukrainian [source](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FU79_ZnX0AAa12X?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) (Michael Kofman also backs that up, as did Sergii Grabskyi).  The actual assault on the city started in late May but it only took about a week for the Russians to push the UAF to the western edge of the city, likely because the battle started like [this](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/78f74e_ef9488934d994d57bb932b4f0b27177b~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_603,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/78f74e_ef9488934d994d57bb932b4f0b27177b~mv2.png), partly surrounded from the get go. Then the TDF counterattacked around Jun 4 and retook part of the city for about a 5 days, at which point Zelensky decided to publicly tie the fate of Severondonetsk to the entire Donbas (not a smart move), and soon after the Russians again pushed the Ukrainians to the western edge of the city. At which point the fighting stalemated for another week until the Russians used PGMs to take out the bridges crossing the Donets, at which point the UAF organized a retreat that finished around Jun 24 towards Lyschansk, which is where they should have been defending from the start because it was high ground, a shorter frontage, they weren't being outflanked at the start of the battle, and it had a major terrain barrier in front of it, the Donets River.\n\nBut because the UAF had stupidly decided to defend Severondonetsk and hold it, manpower and resources that went to Severondonetsk couldn't go to other sections of the Donbas salient, leaving them undermanned and undersupplied, namely around Popasna and to the east up to the Donets where the Russians broke through in both areas. That was how the Russians outflanked the eastern part of the salient and took all of Luhansk causing the UAF to retreat 30-50 miles westwards to the Siversk-Bakhmut Line, causing the loss of Lyschansk, which never really even had a chance to try to defend itself before its supply lines were threatened with being cut.\n\nI'm not being pedantic, NOBODY should try to justify the battle of Severondonetsk, it shouldn't have happened and was a colossal screwup tactically, operationally, strategically, and politically. The best lessons from it are how to avoid such battles in the future.",

Right now Ukraine is firing 5/3-1 in artillery. It's been manageable so far due to precision munitions, GMLRS, and much better targeting systems. Over time the advantage in drone artillery pairs is going to lesson. Russia is slow at adapting, but it's been a year at this point so that edge will diminish. HIMARS provided a huge edge in firepower, but the effect is also starting to wear off due to Russians moving their depots out of way.

Instead, the PFM mines found in Izyum \u201coperate only when scattered by aircraft, rockets and artillery, or when fired from specialised vehicles or launchers\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Their use is banned under the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty \u2013 which Ukraine signed in 1999 and ratified in 2005.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUncleared landmines drive displacement, hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid, and prevent agricultural activities,\u201d read the report.</p>\n\n<p>Russian forces have also used antipersonnel mines in several areas across Ukraine since the war started in February, said the rights group, which documented the issue in three different previously published reports.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut this doesn\u2019t justify Ukrainian use of these prohibited weapons,\u201d Goose said.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry has so far failed to address an inquiry by HRW over the mine use, saying in a written response on November 23 that \u201cinformation on the types of weapons used by Ukraine \u2026 is not to be commented on before the war ends\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>According to the report, the ministry said the \u201cmilitary abides by its international obligations, including the prohibition of the use of any anti-personnel mines\u201d.</p>\n</div>",
