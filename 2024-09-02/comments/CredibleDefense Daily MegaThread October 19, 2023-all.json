As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Despite the fact that Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, Israel's two biggest suppliers, are both predominantly Muslim countries, there's no real chance of this working due to close bilateral ties between the Kazaks and Azerbaijanis with Israel. Only Iraq, Israel's third largest supplier, may agree to something like this, but the supply there is a paltry 50kbpd, and it's still unlikely that they'll go through with it given their financial situation. \n\nSecond, and in a fairly significant step, the U.S. has relaxed [sanctions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-18/us-suspends-some-sanctions-on-venezuelan-oil-gas-gold-sectors) on Venezuela. This had been building up for some time. Maduro has agreed to let opponents run against him in next year's Presidential election, meeting and signing a deal with them in Barbados. The consensus expectation is that PDVSA will ramp up production by 200kbpd maybe as quickly as six months. Venezuela is currently producing ~800kbpd, which is more than double where it was before the U.S. started looking the other way. \n\nThird, shipping costs for Russian oil have started [rising](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/russian-oil-freight-rates-jump-us-boosts-scrutiny-price-cap-compliance-2023-10-17/) again after the U.S. imposed the first sanctions related to the oil price cap around a week ago. Some Greek shippers have been spooked by the unusual compliance requirements and are pulling out of the market. This comes after the spread between Urals and Brent had fallen to ~$11/bbl after averaging around $20/bbl for much of the year. Russia and India are still having issues clearing transactions as well. \n\nLastly, Turkey's Parliament [approved](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231017-turkey-extends-syria-iraq-operations-by-another-two-years) the military's authorization for launching cross-border raids into Syria and Iraq by an additional 2 years. While expected and rubberstamped, this has generally dampened any expectations for the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline from flowing any time soon, despite some optimism a [couple weeks](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/turkey-says-re-start-operations-iraq-oil-pipeline-this-week-2023-10-02/) ago.

As of February 2022, it was a non-public consensus of elites that united both Ukraine's friends in the West and its enemies in Moscow. \n> \n> Awareness of this reality can explain a lot. It explains why the partners limited their assistance to a rather decorative one before the invasion, and why Putin launched his operation, even though he lacked the forces to take over such a huge country.\n\n> \"Back then, getting from Ivano-Frankivsk to Kyiv took two days, 1,038 checkpoints, including four where you\u2019d be shot at, eight where you\u2019d be made to lie with your face on the ground, and 24 where they\u2019d take something from you.\n> \n> We developed a good relationship with patrol police, they accompanied our cars when we went from Ivano-Frankivsk to other oblasts. We still got shot at when entering Kyiv. The driver got really lucky though [and wasn\u2019t hurt], so that\u2019s good.\n> \n> This happened to us on a few more occasions in Kyiv. On the second or third night we were on a TRO mission and were shot at [by Ukrainian forces]. We decided to never go anywhere at night from then on.\"\n> \n> The Prytula Foundation faced similar issues. No one shot at their cars, but their drivers were frequently detained at checkpoints.\n>\n> \"This happened in Kyiv\u2019s Obolon district in late February 2022. A truck with Ukrainian soldiers approached a checkpoint from the Hostomel direction. The driver missed the narrow passage between concrete blocks and skidded a little. A TRO fighter opened fire without warning. One of the soldiers who was in the truck was killed, another had his leg injured. I was a combat medic at the time and treated the injured soldier.\n> \n> Even back then I knew that it was unlikely that a truck full of orcs [Russian soldiers] would just get into Kyiv and drive around. It was fright that made all those people who were holding weapons in their hands for the first time do things like that. Hysteria in the information space made them see saboteurs everywhere,\" Dmytro, an officer and a military psychologist, recalls.\n\nThis sense of panic must have affected logistics, there was friendly fire too.\n\nThis is quite a long article and I couldn't read all of it so I may have missed some interesting points, feel free to quote anything that may have been previously unknown.

As of February 2022, it was a non-public consensus of elites that united both Ukraine&#39;s friends in the West and its enemies in Moscow. </p>\n\n<p>Awareness of this reality can explain a lot. It explains why the partners limited their assistance to a rather decorative one before the invasion, and why Putin launched his operation, even though he lacked the forces to take over such a huge country.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Back then, getting from Ivano-Frankivsk to Kyiv took two days, 1,038 checkpoints, including four where you\u2019d be shot at, eight where you\u2019d be made to lie with your face on the ground, and 24 where they\u2019d take something from you.</p>\n\n<p>We developed a good relationship with patrol police, they accompanied our cars when we went from Ivano-Frankivsk to other oblasts. We still got shot at when entering Kyiv. The driver got really lucky though [and wasn\u2019t hurt], so that\u2019s good.</p>\n\n<p>This happened to us on a few more occasions in Kyiv. On the second or third night we were on a TRO mission and were shot at [by Ukrainian forces]. We decided to never go anywhere at night from then on.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The Prytula Foundation faced similar issues. No one shot at their cars, but their drivers were frequently detained at checkpoints.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This happened in Kyiv\u2019s Obolon district in late February 2022. A truck with Ukrainian soldiers approached a checkpoint from the Hostomel direction. The driver missed the narrow passage between concrete blocks and skidded a little. A TRO fighter opened fire without warning. One of the soldiers who was in the truck was killed, another had his leg injured. I was a combat medic at the time and treated the injured soldier.</p>\n\n<p>Even back then I knew that it was unlikely that a truck full of orcs [Russian soldiers] would just get into Kyiv and drive around. It was fright that made all those people who were holding weapons in their hands for the first time do things like that. Hysteria in the information space made them see saboteurs everywhere,&quot; Dmytro, an officer and a military psychologist, recalls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sense of panic must have affected logistics, there was friendly fire too.</p>\n\n<p>This is quite a long article and I couldn&#39;t read all of it so I may have missed some interesting points, feel free to quote anything that may have been previously unknown.

Unless there is some sort of ceasefire or last minute diplomacy which looks unlikely.\n\nProbably north of 500+ deaths for israel and thousands of casualties wounded. 10s of thousands dead for sure for the Palestinians. It will be the first time to see drone warfare be deployed by an insurgent force. We have already seen drones used to take out huge pieces of armour in Russia and the initial stages of the Hamas raid. It seems the Israelis are anticipating this by using cages and netting like in the Ukraine war.\n\nComparisons. I didn't bother to include Mauripol or Bakhmut since they are fought by near peer adverseries. Aleppo is too titanic a battle to include since it essentially decided the Syrian civil war.\n\n[Fall of Mosul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mosul_(2016%E2%80%932017)) 1-2k soldiers dead Iraqi troops with 8k-10k casualties.Population: 1.5 million.

It will be the first time to see drone warfare be deployed by an insurgent force. We have already seen drones used to take out huge pieces of armour in Russia and the initial stages of the Hamas raid. It seems the Israelis are anticipating this by using cages and netting like in the Ukraine war.</p>\n\n<p>Comparisons. I didn&#39;t bother to include Mauripol or Bakhmut since they are fought by near peer adverseries.

With the major problem now being reconstitution for both sides, special emphasis on training and on replenishing artillery stocks for Ukraine. A short read, and I think a good one at that. \n\nChoice excerpts posted below:\n\n# Attrition and Initiative\n\n>Both Russia and Ukraine have struggled to generate offensive combat power in 2023. The heavy attrition of experienced junior officers and trained field-grade staff has limited the scale at which offensive action can be synchronised.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>For both sides, the ability to expand the scale at which they can operate effectively is constrained by training opportunities. Ukrainian units \u2013 committed to the front \u2013 struggle to be pulled far enough from the Russians to train at larger scale. Russia, meanwhile, is having to commit many of its replacement troops to keep up the strength of its units at the front because of its high rate of casualties. So long as this high casualty rate can be maintained, therefore, it becomes possible to suppress Russia\u2019s ability to train sufficient new troops to the standard needed to effectively conduct offensive action.  \n>  \n>If sustaining a high casualty rate suppresses Russia\u2019s ability to regain the initiative, the question becomes whether Ukraine and its international partners can refine the training pipeline \u2013 better connecting training inside and outside of Ukraine \u2013 to enable Ukraine to exploit the opportunity in the spring. This is complicated by the need to keep up the pressure on Russian forces.\n\n# The Materiel Balance\n\n>Ukraine will face further challenges because of the shifting balance of materiel advantage. Over the summer Ukraine gained fires superiority for the first time, delivering more rounds per day onto Russian positions than came back in many sectors. This was critical to the progress made, but saw an ammunition consumption rate above 200,000 rounds per month.  \n>  \n>Sufficient ammunition to sustain this rate of fire is not going to be forthcoming as NATO stockpiles deplete, and production rates for ammunition remain too low to meet this level of demand. On the Russian side, by comparison, production has turned a corner. Not only is Russian domestic ammunition production rising rapidly, but new ammunition production is being supplied from Iran, North Korea and other states. Bottlenecks in spare barrels and other critical parts will prevent Russia from establishing fires dominance for the next quarter, while NATO production should increase later in 2024, but for a while Ukraine faces the challenge of maintaining Russian attrition without an abundance of artillery.  \n>  \n>Another challenge lies in air defence. The one plausible path towards Russia gaining a decisive advantage on the battlefield is if its aerospace forces are able to begin bombing from medium altitude, significantly increasing the accuracy of their strikes. To do this, they would need to denude Ukraine of its air defences.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>For Russia, the supply of strike munitions is increasing. In October 2022 Russia was producing approximately 40 long-range missiles a month. Now it is producing over 100 a month, and this is supplemented by large numbers of Geran-2 UAVs. Furthermore, on 18 October, UN Security Council restrictions on Iran\u2019s missile programme lapsed. Russia has been pushing for Iran to supply it with missiles after that date, with an expectation that this will provide a large supply of missiles in the winter. NATO\u2019s ability to expand the production of interceptors and radar for air defences is therefore critical.\n\n# Keeping Russia Unbalanced\n\n>Despite these threats, Ukraine has options for continuing to cause Russia\u2019s position in southern Ukraine to deteriorate. Long-range strikes using ATACMS destroyed Electronic Warfare helicopters that had been important for protecting Russian forces from a range of effects. Carefully orchestrated attacks on Russian air defences are also making a range of softer targets more vulnerable. Once these gaps open, Ukraine can maximise the efficiency of the limited stocks of GMLRS it possesses to destroy and disrupt Russian logistics.  \n>  \n>At the same time, if a massed breakthrough is looking less likely, Ukraine can exploit the width of the front to keep Russian forces in the field as the weather deteriorates. Recent attacks across the Dnipro, for example, expand the frontage that Russian troops must defend, reducing the number of forces that can be pulled back and trained or reconstituted. Actions that make progress where the Russians have left themselves vulnerable can be rapidly exploited. Russian commanders cannot, therefore, simply trade space on their flanks.  \n>  \n>The winter once again poses an opportunity to maximise Russian losses. If Russian troops are drawn into the defence along a wide front, with Ukrainian troops pushing into opportunities rather than trying to break through defended areas, then Russian forces will be outside, getting wet and cold. If targeted strikes can degrade their logistics, then the limited training and fieldcraft of Russian forces can maximise climactic injuries. It is notable that Russian casualties last winter were exceedingly high, even when Russia had fires superiority.  \n>  \n>Further activity in the Black Sea is also important. Firstly, expanding the threat to the Crimean Peninsula spreads out increasingly threatened and scarce defensive systems like the S-400. Secondly, the progressive erosion of the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s freedom of manoeuvre helps to set the conditions for the isolation of Crimea in 2024. While these conditions can be created, however, they are all dependent upon the AFU being able to reconstitute. With Washington embroiled in political dysfunction, the assurances needed to plan for 2024 will increasingly fall on European capitals. Thus, for Ukraine\u2019s international partners, the task of creating the conditions for a successful campaign in 2024 must be committed to today.",

                        "body": "Here is 11 data points as to why Trump is VERY unlikely to win. \n\n1. Betting odds does not equal reality. As an example I made a KILLING betting on Biden to win AFTER the election in 2020. The odds for trump to win was at 15% AFTER the election when the evidence was abundant Trump had lost. Easiest 15% ROI I have ever made. I still love to tell people how I managed to make money betting on an already decided election. \n\n2. Sure Biden seems unpopular now but so was Trump even more so quite frankly. Trump ceiling for popularity is Bidens floor. This is in part due to the Democratic coalition just being much bigger than the republicans. \n\n3. Most incumbents win re-election. Even unpopular ones. Obama wasn't very popular at this point in his first term yet he still won re-election. \n\n4. Any polls you see are likely garbage for a head to head race at this point and polls this far out are not predictive. The strongest indication is special elections which the democrats have been OVER performing their 2020 baselines. \n\n5. Trump will likely be in prison and convicted guilty of multiple felonies by the time November 2024. Sure his hardcore base won't care but they make up less than 30% of the electorate. Everyone else is not going to vote for a convicted felon. \n\n6. The Demographics for a Trump win are worse now than in 2016 and 2020. He needs independents and some democratic voters to come over to his side. He only won by a tiny margin in 2016 because independents moved towards him at the last minute. His coalition has lost 3 elections in a row since then. \n\n7. We already know how America feels about Trump vs Biden. We already had a real world data point in the form of an election that is pretty clear on how America feels on it. There is a reason we don't see repeat matchups in America politics very often. It's a bad idea because you already know the answer to the question you are just asking it again. \n\n8. Speaking of demographics all of Trump key demographic areas are shrinking. White non-college, boomers and evangelicals represent a smaller share of the electorate every year. This article shows the data on this really well and the problem with the current Trump led GOP coalition. As an example boomers+silent generation were 43% of the electorate in 2016. In 2024 they will be only 33%. https://www.americanprogress.org/article/americas-electoral-future-3/\n\n9. As of right now the fundamentals look good. Inflation is under control. Biden has gotten several large scale bills passed that were overall quite popular. We seem to have avoided some sort of doomsday recession for now. He has looked strong since his flop in the Afghanistan withdrawal with support for Ukraine, Chips act and alliances against China and now deterrence against the middle east situation expanding. The \"It's the economy stupid\" analysis is bullish on Biden as of right now. \n\n10. Trump is spending a fortune on his legal defense and is a giant sucking machine for campaign finance. Lots of donations that would go to down ballot races and his fund are instead flowing to his legal defense fund.  https://www.statista.com/chart/30516/trump-campaign-funds/\n\n11. RFKJ is pulling voters from the Trump side of the electorate not Biden. While who knows what share of the vote he will get  (probably much less than current polling shows if history is a good indicator) and polls this early are not indicative of what the results will be Trump cannot afford any defections so add that to the pile. https://www.axios.com/2023/10/18/rfk-biden-trump-presidential-election-2024",

If I were the Republicans though I would be really concerned about Texas because that shift in south Texas is the ONLY reason Biden didn't win Texas in 2020, if they had voted for Biden at the same rate they voted for Hilary in 2016 Texas would have been blue in 2020. The demographics in Texas should make it 2-3% more blue in 2024 than 2020. Still not truly a purple state but in a blue wave year it should be on the table.

You might use military force to root out a dangerous group of terrorists, but you don't negotiate with them, and they aren't a legitimate political organization, so going to \"war\" with them is a confusing mess that never ends. Watching the arc of the \"War on Terror\" unfold over my adult life might be biasing my thinking here.\n\nBut if you take a few steps back and ignore the rhetoric, Hamas is a fairly well organized authoritarian dictatorship ruling over the Gaza Strip and therefore two million people. They are indeed brutal religious fanatics, but they're also the defacto government of Gaza, which is also defacto a separate country. Going to war with Hamas is going to war with the state of Gaza, which makes perfect sense after a brutal attack by Gaza and a stated agenda to continue the violence until Israel is eradicated. With this framing, Country A and Country B are going to fight until one side loses unconditionally or a negotiated settlement is achieved. This feels like what is actually happening. Plenty of countries in history have worked themselves up to genocidal violence, and taken swings that either worked or didn't based on force of arms.\n\nOf course, Israel can't tolerate the implications of calling Gaza a hostile country and Hamas a hostile government, so we're back to square one, calling them terrorists to avoid acknowledging their statehood.\n\nI wonder what would happen if Israel said, \"Gaza is a country and we recognize it as a country. Gaza is currently governed by Hamas. We are going to war until Gaza is no longer governed by Hamas, then we're leaving.\" They'd be imposing a \"two state solution\" unilaterally, without gaining anything in direct concession from the Palestinians, and of course no one else would necessarily accept it.

If anything, Biden has shown strength in foreign policy by his actions in Ukraine not only on a bilateral basis, but by leading a truly large coalition to support.
