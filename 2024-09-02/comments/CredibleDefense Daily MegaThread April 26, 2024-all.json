Space just wasn't an important money maker and they thought it would take them decades to be as profitable as their old DOD contracts or commercial aviation in the case of Boeing. ULA was still launching some really cool missions all the way back in 2006. I know many of the SpaceX engineers came from the Atlas V program. Luckey tho is going up against those same companies but in the areas where they make a lot of money and will actually fight to protect their turf. He also doesn't have Elon's billions to burn for nearly twenty years before turning a profit. As former military I want disruptive upstarts to succeed and do well but as someone who currently works in the belly of the beast I think folks too often ignore some of the factors that led to SapceX and Teslas success that had nothing to do with either company.",

Space just wasn&#39;t an important money maker and they thought it would take them decades to be as profitable as their old DOD contracts or commercial aviation in the case of Boeing. ULA was still launching some really cool missions all the way back in 2006. I know many of the SpaceX engineers came from the Atlas V program. Luckey tho is going up against those same companies but in the areas where they make a lot of money and will actually fight to protect their turf.

The same for the Russian air force.</p>\n\n<p>Thus it makes more sense for the Baltic countries to focus on a land defense strategy, buying time for their allies to arrive in sufficient force. It&#39;s also worth noting that NATO countries station fighters in the Baltics to serve as the air force for those countries.</p>\n</div>",

A few notes.\n\n>Equipment to integrate Western air defense launchers, missiles, and radars with Ukraine's air defense systems\n\nLooks like FrankenSam will continue in earnest. If we're not going to see a lot of Patriot systems delivered, we may see *parts* of them delivered. Something that's been worked on since last year. Buks and Sea Sparrows have already been a big success.\n\n>Munitions for laser-guided rocket systems\n\nThis is probably 70mm rockets for VAMPIRE\n\n>Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)\n\nPurposefully vague, mind you. Ammunition goes beyond just GMLRS.\n\n>155mm and **152mm artillery rounds**\n\nThis money will likely be used to help expand production capabilities of allies as well as the United States. Let's keep an eye on Eastern Europe. Unless, of course, this is the US spending money on buying those shells from the two European initiatives.\n\n>Precision aerial munitions\n\nMore JDAM-ERs most likely. But it will be interesting if the US is working on improved glide bombs or a different system.\n\n>Switchblade and Puma Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)\n\nThe specific kind of Switchblade is unmentioned here. It's interesting that they're still spending money on this considering that the SB300 is not exactly cost-efficient and there were some mixed reviews about SB600.

Those outside Ukraine were not happy of course, specially because now they will have to go to Ukraine physically to renew their passports, which means that they will have to be granted a permit to leave Ukraine afterwards.

(I will just talk about the measures on suspension of consular services and the issuance of passports only in Ukraine) I believe that these two measures are short sighted and mainly aimed for propaganda purposes inside Ukraine (to show the Ukrainians inside that the government tries to get the men back from abroad). The reason why I think that is the case is because the Ukrainian diaspora that left Ukraine 10+ years ago, most probably already has citizenships of their host countries therefore the measures won't affect them a lot. Those that have left Ukraine illegally to escape the war/mobilisation will find other means in order to not return to Ukraine, many EU countries (including Poland, Germany, Lithuania and Finland) issue dedicated IDs to migrants that do not require a passport for visas. Other countries such as mine (Greece) do not require a valid passport for visa renewal if you provide them a good reason (there is a commission that decides if these reasons are valid or not). So the most likely result of the measures would be increased legal/administrative fees for the Ukrainians abroad. Those Ukrainians that won't renew their passports will lose their right to travel between EU MS due to the visa waiver and it would be harder for them to move to a different EU country and ask for temporary protection, basically they will be stuck in the country that has already granted them temporary protection. Those that have left Ukraine legally after the war will also be affected and it seems that they will be the category that will most probably return to Ukraine.IMO without the consent of the EU members to deport the Ukrainians, these measures will fail.\n\nTL DL: The measures won't have a great result in generating manpower unless EU members start deporting the Ukrainian men and are mainly aimed at the internal audience in Ukraine.",

Demography plays a significant role, with sizable pools in the lower classes. Most individuals called upon had little choice or understanding of the situation. With the country surrounded by two huge oceans, there was no easy way out. Ukraine has none of this, in fact its situation is almost opposite, not to mention the differences in culture and information flows and access even for poorer/less educated folks today, so how does that compare? You can conscript people, not willingness. When the US entered WW2, they did not have hundreds of thousands of military casualties like Ukraine does already. Those don't magically reappar. If I were called upon, not even knowing the numbers would not boost my confidence either. Additionally, Ukraine did not solely rely on volunteers throughout the war.\n\nIt's obviously a huge issue. We can of course downvote, ignore, maybe it goes away. It also poses a challenge for propaganda, as Russia can exploit the situation to fit their narrative about contested land belonging to them anyhow. Although I clearly do not share the viewpoint, Ukrainians not putting up a fight does not provide us with more arguments. I can perfectly understand it on a personal level, but ultimately someone must take action or else you lose. Just lose. That's *one* reason I supported NATO intervention. Already equipped, highly trained, professional and mainly **voluntary** soldiers working for an alliance and the very challenge and mission that alliance was *only* ever intended for. Basically no one else was. Thus it's now up to others to support and motivate the Ukrainian men. So far, I'm not impressed.",
