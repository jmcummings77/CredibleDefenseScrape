Part of the war, if you think back to February 2022, was the fear of stationing further \"offensive\" missiles in Eastern Europe, and in particular the fear they could be stationed in a pro-NATO Ukraine. Patriot, along with the other two, was one such missile Russia wanted removed as part of the last minute summit held that winter. Instead of achieving those long term objectives, Poland is now not just getting more American missiles but *their own* systems to use as they want. And once they integrate with the Patriot standard, that further opens the door to the proliferation of systems like THAAD which IIRC use pretty much the same base as Patriot. This is another case in Russia's prewar regional strategy has been undermined by the political shift caused by the war itself, and is as huge IMO as Ukraine getting Patriot for the long term positioning of Eastern Europe & Russia. \n\n\\[RE: ABMs, Russia is not entirely wrong about the destabilizing effect of an effective ABM system. How can defensive weapons be destabilizing? Because if you assume the deterrent to war is mutually assured destruction, ABMs and defensive systems open to door to a successful or more successful exchange. Think of it like two gunslingers with pistols at each others heads. If I put a helmet on, maybe I can shoot you and avoid the negative consequence. Where Russia's argument breaks down is first, THAAD is not that good, second Russia's second strike capability is global and overwhelming, and third they conflate purely defensive non-ABM systems like Patriot with offensive MRBMs which could drop a nuke on Moscow. This is all an intentional blurring of the lines and rolls between missiles, and IMO is done as a way of stoking the Reagan era Euromissile fears even though the US maintains no Pershing equivalent anymore.\\]",

These were:\n\n- reform of the Constitutional Court;\n- continuation of judicial reform;\n- anti-corruption, including the appointment of the head of the SAPO;\n- anti-money laundering;\n- implementation of the anti-oligarchic law, including recommendations of the Venice Commission;\n- harmonization of audiovisual legislation with European;\n- change in legislation on national minorities.\n\nA lot of his new policies seem to be aimed directly at fulfilling some of these initial reform demands. \n\nAfter Ukraine completes these initial steps, it will be more fully assessed, based on the now 35 chapters of the EU aquis. Ukraine will basically get 35 initial lists of required changes and achievements to begin complying with EU legislation and goals. After completing these initial lists, the EU members will vote on actually opening the specific chapters, based on met preconditions. That's when the real work starts and Ukraine has to fully comply with the aquis in each area. Only after fulfilling these new demands can the chapters be closed, which would put Ukraine in reach of membership.\n\nThis is going to be a long a massive process, which took the other former Warsaw pact members more than a decade to achieve. The requirements have likely increased significantly since then, but Ukraine has to win a war, rebuild the country and comply with these new rules. By the time Ukraine\u2019s chapters will be opened, there will likely be significant environmental demands they'll have to achieve, for example.\n\nI think Zelensky is trying to get his people to actively participate in this gigantic task his country faces, because there's no way to make the necessary changes without broad popular support, which necessitates democratic participation.",

These were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>reform of the Constitutional Court;</li>\n<li>continuation of judicial reform;</li>\n<li>anti-corruption, including the appointment of the head of the SAPO;</li>\n<li>anti-money laundering;</li>\n<li>implementation of the anti-oligarchic law, including recommendations of the Venice Commission;</li>\n<li>harmonization of audiovisual legislation with European;</li>\n<li>change in legislation on national minorities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A lot of his new policies seem to be aimed directly at fulfilling some of these initial reform demands. </p>\n\n<p>After Ukraine completes these initial steps, it will be more fully assessed, based on the now 35 chapters of the EU aquis. Ukraine will basically get 35 initial lists of required changes and achievements to begin complying with EU legislation and goals. After completing these initial lists, the EU members will vote on actually opening the specific chapters, based on met preconditions. That&#39;s when the real work starts and Ukraine has to fully comply with the aquis in each area. Only after fulfilling these new demands can the chapters be closed, which would put Ukraine in reach of membership.</p>\n\n<p>This is going to be a long a massive process, which took the other former Warsaw pact members more than a decade to achieve. The requirements have likely increased significantly since then, but Ukraine has to win a war, rebuild the country and comply with these new rules. By the time Ukraine\u2019s chapters will be opened, there will likely be significant environmental demands they&#39;ll have to achieve, for example.</p>\n\n<p>I think Zelensky is trying to get his people to actively participate in this gigantic task his country faces, because there&#39;s no way to make the necessary changes without broad popular support, which necessitates democratic participation.</p>\n</div>",

One problem is costs, paperwork, delays, but the biggest problem is information: Russia refuses to communicate names and locations of children it took from Ukraine, making it very hard for parents or relatives to find their children. From parents who managed to retrieve their children, in most cases it is either because they knew what camp the child was sent to (ex. many children from Izyum were sent to summer/patriotic camps by the schools under Russian occupation, but then Russia refused to send them back after liberation of the city) or because the children were old enough to contact them by phone or via a social network, some Russian volunteers also help with this (and sometimes even people who work in the orphanages or camps where these children are kept).\n\nOther cases are the orphans, taken from Ukrainian orphanages, and those separated in filtration camps, in which case parents are sent to prison or even sometimes disappear while their children are brought to Russia - but I think this is a much smaller proportion. And I think parents who go to get their children must also go through a sort of filtration..

Maybe even had him up on stage and pinned a medal on him by now.</p>\n\n<p>However, not a word about him. Silence. Never mentioned, and not seen again since the video appeal. No footage of him marching around commanding loyal troops etc etc as we&#39;ve had with Kadyrov.... who declared nearly a day later.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>very strongly</em> suggests he was indeed marched in front of camera&#39;s by the FSB and told to call Prigo off..... which, in turn, adds a LOT of credibility to his likely location now being in prison/under house arrest/halfway between the 17th floor and the ground floor.</p>\n</div>",

In the 2000s with the delivery of the Arietes and the disbanding of quite a lot of tank regiments they were put into reserve; they were then sold to the Swiss RUAG in 2016 which was planning to upgrade such tanks to sell them to Brazil which is a big user of the Leopard 1A5 currently.

Certainly speaking about VDV we know that the 106th Division was instrumental in securing the flanks during the winter and is still deployed in the area; the 31st Brigade was deployed quickly during May to cover the flanks threatened by Ukrainian attacks and seems to be suffering very significant setbacks in terms of losses of officers of the formation (and consequently, we can guess, soldiers). \n\nIn general, Russia is quite in trouble there due to Wagner's withdrawal, and this must be the reason why they are sending so many VDV units (I was reading rumors that they might send the 98th Division too) along with the mobilized of the 2nd Corps (former LPR formation) and the volunteers of 3rd Corps rushed from Avdiivka. This could be the cause of the small but steady Ukrainian advances they are making without deploying new units to the area.

If you have such footage, feel free to send it my way, and I&#39;ll review it.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit: I was likely wrong &#39;pidor&#39; means &#39;pedophile&#39;, <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14l7lw0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_28_2023/jpv62rq/\">see this reply</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I was confused by the translation done by OP, indeed if we look at the original Telegram post: <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/bahshiddemon/487 it contains &#39;\u043f\u0456\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432&#39; (plural of &#39;pidor&#39;), no mention of &#39;faggots&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I feel really stupid commenting/discussing subtle distinctions of profane slurs.</p>\n</div>",

Most never knew much about small arms, but whatever they did know was largely outdated (a lot has changed since a 50-60 year old was 20-30). \n\n)- NGSW is the pet project of Mark Milley, soon to be outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, former Chief of Staff of the Army. Notice how the NGSW went from being an Army project to one that other services started talking about adopting? Check the dates for who the most powerful uniformed general officer was at the time. As Milley grew more powerful, so did NGSW. \n\n)- For the actual subject matter experts in the US Army and the overall US mil tactical carbine community, I can't think of anyone who wanted anything remotely like the XM7. Like the shooting around corners concepts that generals keep trying to push with new tech, the features of extreme long range flat trajectory (essentially a semi/full auto 270 WSM), heavy recoil, heavy ammo, limited magazine capacity, etc, was not what was on the leading edge. The most agreed upon consensus was for a mass issued M4A1 SOPMOD Block 3, with a 1-6 or 1-8 LPVO scope. So buy scope, mount, and rail, and just modify existing rifles. 5.56 was good enough, especially M855A1. \n\nMost of the community did want a replacement for the M249, it's old and there are better models that can do that job much better. And while they didn't want the XM157 fire control optic, many like it since it's actually quite useful for highly skilled shooters (though a $10k paper weight for mediocre and bad ones). \n\n)- There has been an ongoing debate within DOD and elsewhere about the merits of 5.56 NATO since it was fielded. By the end of the GWOT, most of the myths around it and the M16/M4 were killed but not in the general officer corps, who again don't know much. But they do have a tendency to listen to people they respect. Note, not face shooting door kicking badasses in their own service, but retired 78 year old jackasses like [Robert Scales](https://taskandpurpose.com/tech-tactics/us-infantry-rifle-robert-scales/), who has hated and shit talked the M16 since it \"failed him\" during his Vietnam service as a junior artillery officer (lol, real subject matter expert right there). Scales, despite being a decrepit idiot, was monumental in the DOD's Close Combat Lethality Task Force. And guess what they pressed for? \n\nhttps://www.ausa.org/sites/default/files/publications/SL-18-2-Regaining-Tactical-Overmatch-The-Close-Combat-Lethality-Task-Force.pdf\n\nWhat does overmatch mean for small arms?

The idea was that the US Army was not ready for Near Peer combat against the Russians, everything needed to be revamped. When it came to small arms, here's the thought process:\n\n- Soldiers are taught to aim center mass on a frontal facing target, a location mostly covered by ballistic plate armor worn by Near Peer that's\n- Careful analysis of rifle qualification testing by the 82nd Airborne (seen by Big Army top brass as the best conventional unit) showed that hit percentages of head/torso sized targets was low enough that it was unlikely they'd score multiple hits, especially after 150 meters\n- a new 7.62 NATO AP round had been designed that was more effective than existing M995, supposedly cheaper to manufacturer (though they were still getting the tungsten mostly from China). \n\nSo using this asinine stats and info, despite Army SMEs recommending against it, Milley tried to purchase off the shelf 7.62 NATO battle rifles and mass issue them to Army combat arms units already stationed in Europe and the XVIII Airborne Corps, who would be the first CONUS based units to be rushed to respond to a Russian invasion of NATO Eastern Europe.

Small arms used in complex ambushes were extremely common (fire off a mag or two while someone else blows an IED and someone else fires the RPG). There were PLENTY of isolated sniper attacks, and those typically went only one way (firing back without positively identifying the sniper's location is either poor training or posturing). Close range engagements might happen occasionally during building clearing associated with raids or clearing operations. And our bases, either Joint Service Station/Combat Outposts (COP) or Forward Operating Bases (FOB), might be subject to harassing fire or legit attacks which included small arms fire. Typical engagement range was less than 100 meters. Most US troops never even saw a live enemy fighting.\n\nI didn't go to Afghanistan, only Iraq, but I studied the conflict, especially where US forces were primarily stationed.  In the north and eastern parts of Afghanistan, which were mountainous rural areas, enemy forces (including but not limited to the Taliban) would often initiate contact from 500 meters to max effective range of RPG and PKM. The former has a built-in autodetonate feature at \\~880 meters (creating an adhoc airburst munition), which was also extremely effective at suppressing just using the effects of the oldest version of the HEAT warhead (which have very limited blast or frag effects).  PKM's fire 7.62x54Rm, which is a pre-WW1 era full power cartridge meant for 1.5-2 km engagements, so fired in short bursts with a rough range estimation would also have rather impressive suppression effects even out to 1 km (hits were rare, suppression wasn't).\n\nConsidering they were often firing from hidden positions that were hard to spot, and were the ones initiating the firefights against their enemy they could see (dismounted units patrolling in the open, vehicles driving slowly on a treacherous trails, personnel walking around inside their COPs that were situated in low ground dominated by heights where enemy forces often took up fighting positions, etc), it meant they had the tactical advantages to make their weaponry that much more effective.\n\nMeanwhile, US Army or Marine infantry platoons have limited means to match those ranges. 5.56 carbines and LMGs have a max effective range, especially with suppression, out to about 700-750 meters (ammo dependent) but that presumes they know how, which we didn't. The US Army doesn't train its riflemen to fire much if at all to beyond 300 meters. The USMC shoots 450 meters but they don't do it in a very realistic manner, nor are the taught the extra pieces needed to do it effectively in combat (scanning).\n\nExisting medium machine guns like the M240 were highly effective. As were dedicated snipers attached to units, and 7.62 NATO designated marksman rifles (though training was still inconsistent and flawed), extra weapons issued to units going to Afghanistan like an additional 7.62 NATO light machine gun per squad (typically the MK48), more 60mm mortars meant to be used in the patrol mode, and M3 MAAWS Carl Gustaf recoilless rifles increased the number of weapons that return fire.\n\nBut again, that assumes they know where to shoot, which we didn't. The enemy controlled the engagements, nearly always fired from concealed locations. The typical infantryman wasn't taught scanning, while weapon magnified optics and binos got issued out in larger numbers, it didn't include the training that recon personnel or snipers get (target detection) that trains their brain and eyes on how to find targets. Laser range finders weren't issued out to team leaders and above to give accurate fire commands to their troops, etc.\n\nWith no different weaponry we could have been multiple times more effective if we had devoted the proper training. However, that doesn't sell on powerpoint slides as well as buying a new weapon system that a bunch of gullible general officers are told with solve the problem without needing to increase training.",

It's about the cheapest training you can get. Everyone should get some form of magnified optic, snipers use 10x binos and up to 45x spotting scopes but a 4x ACOG works and it can even be done with the naked eye. Cadre running it lay engineer tape in a line and then set up various stuff, can be pretty much anything, ten of them, and partially hide the objects in a tree line, side of a building, etc about 50-100 meters away. One cadre member stays on the line at different locations making sure it's possible to see everything placed (as little as 25% of the object can be visible) as the other places them. Once they're ready they move the trainees through the lane onto the tape who have a piece of paper and pen, told to go prone and find the objects. The time limit is broken down into thirds, with everyone told to move to different parts of the line to better see different objects. After an hour or so it's over. Everyone is graded by how much they found, how they identified them, described them by color, size/dimensions, shade, etc, and where they plot them on their hand drawn map.

A shame, it would have been perfect for Afghanistan. \n\nI'd add to that high definition videos taken of Combloc muzzle signatures from different firing positions from the downrange perspective, to learn how much flash one should expect, or dust flying around, etc. Plus classes on enemy tactics and how they typically choose firing positions, so troops learn how to judge where a good enemy firing position would be located. And range estimation training, augmenting by mass issue of handheld $300-500 commercial laser range finders to all NCOs. \n\nIf it was up to me I'd have totally reorganized the fire team and squad organization, where everyone gets paired up based on skill and weapon assigned as either shooter or spotter, who work together trying to find targets and accurately engage them even with close misses for suppression. While the rifle squads were doing that the heavy weapon squad organic or attached would get mortars or recoilless rifles set up for airburst fire missions at the known or most likely enemy positions identified.

        "body": "A letter by the mobilised commander of an T-80B tank (originally an anti-aircraft reserve officer) from Moscow published on Lostarmour\n\nMain points:\n\n\\- Not happy with his T-80B, which lacks thermal imaging. Envies the T-62M which has one.\n\n\\- The tank battalion in his motor rifle regiment is distributed in platoon-sized elements among infantry units. One tank company is kept in reserve.\n\n\\- Comms are crap (that's a recurring complaint by practically every frontline unit). They buy their own Baofeng radios, upper-tier encrypted devices are rare.\n\n\\- The total salary for an enlisted mobilised soldier is about 400k roubles, with provincial and other bonuses. That's about $4,650.\n\n=============================\n\nhttps://lost\\*[armour.info/svo](https://armour.info/svo) (remove \\*)\n\nFrom my correspondence in VK with a nice person. That's why it's a bit rambling. Published with his permission.  \nMobilized, officer. Military vocational school is air defense, but he's in command of a tank platoon. The regiment's 70-90% of the personnel are mobilized. They are from Moscow, the regiment is also almost all from Moscow, the Moscow and Tula Regions.  \nThe regiment is motorized: 3 infantry battalions and 1 tank battalion. The regiment sits in defence covered by minefields. Hinzirs \\[Ukrainians?\\] are sitting opposite too behind the mines.  \nThe tank battalion was split up by type. One company per infantry battalion. At the same time armored group (platoon?), allocated from the company, is in the infantry combat ranks. The rest of the company is in the depths as a reserve.  \nBasically tanks are firing from closed positions, like SPG.  \n\"We only went out to direct fire once and that was just on the front line as a training exercise.\"  \nIn a day the positions of the battalion are shelled by the enemy 5 to 10 times. Five to ten shells  each. And silence. Well, ours throw back fire too. Birds \\[drones\\] in the air all the time, flying in all directions.  \n\"They worked our mortar with a Grad once, hit it, but no consequences. But it's still 300 \\[wounded\\] every week. 200 \\[dead\\] is rare, but it happens. And there's Baba Yaga \\[big quadcopters with bombs\\] flying at night. Shot down the bastard.\"  \n\"One tank burned in the car park. Just as Baba Yaga flew in for the first time. A kamikaze drone (FPV?) missed once, about 70 centimetres, hit the ground\".\n\nMobilised men have 2 weeks leave, including travel. There is no information on the terms of service of the mobilised. Contracts are not forced to be signed. There are no problems with the payment of salaries. There are even inquiries (made by whom?) about delayed payments.  \nNext there is a quote:  \n\n\n\"There's not much to write. All life is in the woods, well, at least for us. We arrive, set up a \"bum-camp\", if we have logs (sometimes they are brought to us, sometimes we find them ourselves) we dig a dug-out. And then we start the landscaping. Toilet, kitchen, generator room. Then the command \"Let's move\" \\[relocate\\] and start all over again. The last time we were lucky to come into the lane, where the bunkers were partially ready. And so we dig more infantry, they stand on the place \".  \nOn my question: \"You are an air defence officer, how did you get in tanks? \"The answer was: \"Nobody asked me. There is such a shortage of junior officers that they take everybody\". The regiment was trained in Belarus, for 3 months.  \nAbout the logistics: \"The uniform was issued once. The soles of the summer boots fell off, the winter ones just burst. But fortunately the field mail worked and my wife sent me everything. Friends sent rubber boots also very timely. We have no armour \\[bulletproof vests\\], tank crews are not entitled to armour. The infantry are much better. They are much scolded if they don't wear them.\n\nSalary for an enlisted man  \n190,000-200,000 a month, depending on position.  \nThis is a salary from the Ministry of Defence plus 158,000 extra. In Moscow, plus 50,000 from Sobyanin. At the firing range they paid the same. But contract servicemen were paid pennies and it was only after zero they started paying combat pay.\"  \nThere's plenty of food: \"There's plenty now. We can't eat everything. Of course it's monotonous. There are three kinds of stew. Pasta, buckwheat, etc.\"  \n\n\nMore about the uniforms:  \n\"Not everyone's VKPO. I was given a number, an old one still underneath the hem. In winter we raced in tanks. In spring my wife sent me a slide, so I wore it. The demi-seasonal VKPO was all right, but not everybody was given one.  \nNo one was given a full set.  \nSomeone was lucky and we were even given modern underwear. Some people weren't, and we bought thermal underwear ourselves.  \nAbout communications: \"Communications was crap. We use baofengs between us and TUT at battalion level. Above us there are granites and Azartas, which are unavailable to us. But even they have shitty communication. Two Baofeng were sent by my friends, I bought two more, I'm going to take. The whole company's got them. Only it is possible to speak by them only by coded phrases. The enemy listens\".  \nAbout drones:  \n\"There are maviks in the battalion, with which my armoured group stands. They lose them from time to time, new ones come to them with humanitarian aid.\n\nServes on a T-80B tank. The main complaint is about the SLA (night sight).  \n\"The funny thing about the T-62M is that it has a thermal imager, and we really miss it. Regular night sights without the \"Moon\" \\[IR searchlight\\] see poorly, and to turn it on is to light yourself up very, very badly.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A letter by the mobilised commander of an T-80B tank (originally an anti-aircraft reserve officer) from Moscow published on Lostarmour</p>\n\n<p>Main points:</p>\n\n<p>- Not happy with his T-80B, which lacks thermal imaging. Envies the T-62M which has one.</p>\n\n<p>- The tank battalion in his motor rifle regiment is distributed in platoon-sized elements among infantry units. One tank company is kept in reserve.</p>\n\n<p>- Comms are crap (that&#39;s a recurring complaint by practically every frontline unit). They buy their own Baofeng radios, upper-tier encrypted devices are rare.</p>\n\n<p>- The total salary for an enlisted mobilised soldier is about 400k roubles, with provincial and other bonuses. That&#39;s about $4,650.</p>\n\n<h1></h1>\n\n<p>https://lost*<a href=\"https://armour.info/svo\">armour.info/svo</a> (remove *)</p>\n\n<p>From my correspondence in VK with a nice person. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a bit rambling. Published with his permission.<br/>\nMobilized, officer. Military vocational school is air defense, but he&#39;s in command of a tank platoon. The regiment&#39;s 70-90% of the personnel are mobilized. They are from Moscow, the regiment is also almost all from Moscow, the Moscow and Tula Regions.<br/>\nThe regiment is motorized: 3 infantry battalions and 1 tank battalion. The regiment sits in defence covered by minefields. Hinzirs [Ukrainians?] are sitting opposite too behind the mines.<br/>\nThe tank battalion was split up by type. One company per infantry battalion. At the same time armored group (platoon?), allocated from the company, is in the infantry combat ranks. The rest of the company is in the depths as a reserve.<br/>\nBasically tanks are firing from closed positions, like SPG.<br/>\n&quot;We only went out to direct fire once and that was just on the front line as a training exercise.&quot;<br/>\nIn a day the positions of the battalion are shelled by the enemy 5 to 10 times. Five to ten shells  each. And silence. Well, ours throw back fire too. Birds [drones] in the air all the time, flying in all directions.<br/>\n&quot;They worked our mortar with a Grad once, hit it, but no consequences. But it&#39;s still 300 [wounded] every week. 200 [dead] is rare, but it happens. And there&#39;s Baba Yaga [big quadcopters with bombs] flying at night. Shot down the bastard.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;One tank burned in the car park. Just as Baba Yaga flew in for the first time. A kamikaze drone (FPV?) missed once, about 70 centimetres, hit the ground&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Mobilised men have 2 weeks leave, including travel. There is no information on the terms of service of the mobilised. Contracts are not forced to be signed. There are no problems with the payment of salaries. There are even inquiries (made by whom?) about delayed payments.<br/>\nNext there is a quote:  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s not much to write. All life is in the woods, well, at least for us. We arrive, set up a &quot;bum-camp&quot;, if we have logs (sometimes they are brought to us, sometimes we find them ourselves) we dig a dug-out. And then we start the landscaping. Toilet, kitchen, generator room. Then the command &quot;Let&#39;s move&quot; [relocate] and start all over again. The last time we were lucky to come into the lane, where the bunkers were partially ready. And so we dig more infantry, they stand on the place &quot;.<br/>\nOn my question: &quot;You are an air defence officer, how did you get in tanks? &quot;The answer was: &quot;Nobody asked me. There is such a shortage of junior officers that they take everybody&quot;. The regiment was trained in Belarus, for 3 months.<br/>\nAbout the logistics: &quot;The uniform was issued once. The soles of the summer boots fell off, the winter ones just burst. But fortunately the field mail worked and my wife sent me everything. Friends sent rubber boots also very timely. We have no armour [bulletproof vests], tank crews are not entitled to armour. The infantry are much better. They are much scolded if they don&#39;t wear them.</p>\n\n<p>Salary for an enlisted man<br/>\n190,000-200,000 a month, depending on position.<br/>\nThis is a salary from the Ministry of Defence plus 158,000 extra. In Moscow, plus 50,000 from Sobyanin. At the firing range they paid the same. But contract servicemen were paid pennies and it was only after zero they started paying combat pay.&quot;<br/>\nThere&#39;s plenty of food: &quot;There&#39;s plenty now. We can&#39;t eat everything. Of course it&#39;s monotonous. There are three kinds of stew. Pasta, buckwheat, etc.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>More about the uniforms:<br/>\n&quot;Not everyone&#39;s VKPO. I was given a number, an old one still underneath the hem. In winter we raced in tanks. In spring my wife sent me a slide, so I wore it. The demi-seasonal VKPO was all right, but not everybody was given one.<br/>\nNo one was given a full set.<br/>\nSomeone was lucky and we were even given modern underwear. Some people weren&#39;t, and we bought thermal underwear ourselves.<br/>\nAbout communications: &quot;Communications was crap. We use baofengs between us and TUT at battalion level. Above us there are granites and Azartas, which are unavailable to us. But even they have shitty communication. Two Baofeng were sent by my friends, I bought two more, I&#39;m going to take. The whole company&#39;s got them. Only it is possible to speak by them only by coded phrases. The enemy listens&quot;.<br/>\nAbout drones:<br/>\n&quot;There are maviks in the battalion, with which my armoured group stands. They lose them from time to time, new ones come to them with humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n<p>Serves on a T-80B tank. The main complaint is about the SLA (night sight).<br/>\n&quot;The funny thing about the T-62M is that it has a thermal imager, and we really miss it. Regular night sights without the &quot;Moon&quot; [IR searchlight] see poorly, and to turn it on is to light yourself up very, very badly. It is necessary to change a gunner&#39;s night sight a thermal imager, as on T-80BVM or T-72B3M&quot;.<br/>\nAbout prisoners and locals:<br/>\n&quot;There were no prisoners. They [Ukrainians] do not attack either. And everything is littered with mines.<br/>\nThere are not many locals in the nearest village, it&#39;s the front line after all. One woman sells bread and milk, someone supplies the infantry with moonshine, not for free.<br/>\nBut there are only eight of them for a village of fifty houses&quot;.<br/>\nThe mood of the personnel is summarised by the phrase: &quot;I&#39;m fed up with it, let&#39;s get it on&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

But interesting that it is occuring at the battalion-task force level, not at the regimental level.  Just highlights how much the battalion is the place where action is coordinated on both sides. Its the fighting unit as the Regiment and brigade was in the 80s. Also interesting that even there a large reserve is being kept.

        "body": "[The Intercept: THE SEARCHER, Fishing for Secrets in the Nord Stream Abyss](https://theintercept.com/2023/06/28/nord-stream-pipeline-bomb-investigation/)\n\n**DISCLAIMER: As highlighted in the responses, the guy appears to hold strongly anti-Ukraine views, which may motivate him to pin the destruction of Nord Stream on Ukraine or the USA. Therefore, it's possible that he may be concealing or refraining from disclosing certain relevant facts he might have uncovered.**\n\nThe article details an expedition to the Nord Stream site led by a Swedish guy ([his Twitter](https://twitter.com/Erkperk)), who invested $20k into this project ($10k on a drone, $10k ship + captain rental). The guy is known for his MAGA-leaning conspiracy theories, he famously put a $12k bet in 2015 on Trump's election win (and won $300k due to betting odds), he wishes that Sweden would get a Trump-like politician.\n\nNotwithstanding the above (MAGA/Grayzone), his findings appear credible. Initially, he embarked on the expedition to affirm Hersch's theory, but he ultimately largely debunked it, a fact he admits. Summary:\n\n * [3 Nord Stream pipes had 4 explosive devices placed on them](https://imgur.com/Ye5HDpe),\n * 1 pipe wasn't bombed at all,\n * an error led to the placement of 2 devices on the same 1 pipe, resulting in that pipeline being bombed twice,\n * the mistake may have been induced by a local magnetic anomaly at one of the explosion sites that disrupts compass accuracy. This same anomaly affected his drone.

Therefore, it&#39;s possible that he may be concealing or refraining from disclosing certain relevant facts he might have uncovered.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The article details an expedition to the Nord Stream site led by a Swedish guy (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Erkperk\">his Twitter</a>), who invested $20k into this project ($10k on a drone, $10k ship + captain rental). The guy is known for his MAGA-leaning conspiracy theories, he famously put a $12k bet in 2015 on Trump&#39;s election win (and won $300k due to betting odds), he wishes that Sweden would get a Trump-like politician.</p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding the above (MAGA/Grayzone), his findings appear credible. Initially, he embarked on the expedition to affirm Hersch&#39;s theory, but he ultimately largely debunked it, a fact he admits. Summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://imgur.com/Ye5HDpe\">3 Nord Stream pipes had 4 explosive devices placed on them</a>,</li>\n<li>1 pipe wasn&#39;t bombed at all,</li>\n<li>an error led to the placement of 2 devices on the same 1 pipe, resulting in that pipeline being bombed twice,</li>\n<li>the mistake may have been induced by a local magnetic anomaly at one of the explosion sites that disrupts compass accuracy. This same anomaly affected his drone. Moreover, a BBC crew and reporters from Sweden\u2019s Expressen newspaper also experienced this anomaly while filming at the location,</li>\n<li>the release of energy due to pressurized natural gas greatly surpassed the energy exerted by the explosions themselves, all the devastation/carnage observed on the seafloor primarily stems from the energy release of pressurized natural gas, not explosives,</li>\n<li>it&#39;s probable that seismic readings were detecting not the initial detonations, but the violent discharge of gas pressure at once,</li>\n<li>3 explosions of the 4 are clustered in a singular place/location,</li>\n<li>the 1 explosion is in a different location; this geographically separated explosion happened 17 hours prior to the other three,</li>\n<li>the 1 explosion that is at a geographically separated location is the one that happened 17 hours prior to the other 3 explosions,</li>\n<li>the pipeline that was targeted twice experienced an initial explosion, followed by a second one (17 hours later) that took place on an already emptied pipe (all the natural gas being discharged from the pipe due to the detonation that occurred 17 hours earlier),</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The explosion on an empty pipe is interesting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the damage inflicted on the empty pipe (filled with water) was solely due to the explosion, not pressurized natural gas, as there was none inside at the time of the detonation,</li>\n<li>the explosive was placed on the pipe&#39;s seam, which is its weakest point (might be true for all 4 explosions, the article doesn&#39;t specify), </li>\n<li>contrary to prior assumptions, it does not seem to have been a shaped charge; instead, it appears to have been a rather rudimentary assembly of explosive slabs, probably weighing only between 10 to 20 kg (conclusion based on what the pipe looks like after the denotation, the article cites independent experts for this),</li>\n<li>the explosives were likely buried in a small hole dug underneath the pipe (the experts cited in an article say that digging with a robot would be impractical, implying that the diver did it), </li>\n<li>previous reports based on seismic readings suggesting 500-600 kg of explosives were likely inaccurate; the seismic readings and extensive damage at the sites were primarily due to the release of natural gas pressure, not the explosions themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What all of this likely implies is that the bombing of the pipes did not necessitate the significant resources of a state actor.

At the same time, a Ukrainian photographer on or before Saturday got close enough to the site of the failed assault to snap photos of the Russian minefield that trapped the Ukrainian battlegroup, ultimately destroying dozens of 47th and 33rd Brigades\u2019 best Western-made vehicles and killing or wounding many Ukrainians.\n\n...\n\nAnd then there are the mines, including hundreds or even thousands of TM-62s. The 21-pound TM-62 is your traditional mine: a big metal disk, packed with explosives and fitted with one of several fuze types. The pressure fuze might be the most popular. Engineers bury TM-62s by hand or speed up the operation by deploying a GMZ minelaying vehicle.\r  \n\r  \nThere\u2019s nothing fancy about a pressure-fuze TM-62. But there doesn\u2019t have to be when you lay them as densely as Russian engineers clearly did south of Mala Tokmachka. The recent photos of the old battlefield depict unexploded TM-62s lying just a few feet apart in the minefield equivalent of a thick carpet.\n\n...\n\nRussian scouts spotted the 47th-33rd Brigade battlegroup approaching Robotyne on June 8 and called in Kamov attack helicopters that plucked at the Ukrainian column with anti-tank missiles. But it was the mines that did in the 33rd and 47th Brigades.\r  \n\r  \nThe 47th Brigade\u2019s ex-Finnish Leopard 2R mineclearing vehicles led the way, assisted by at least one German-made Wisent mineclearer possibly belonging to the 33rd Brigade.\r  \n\r  \nThe mineclearing vehicles plowed up some of the mines, clearing a few lanes partially through the minefield. 47th Brigade M-2s and MaxxPro armored trucks\u2014all donated by the United States\u2014followed close behind.\r  \n\r  \nBut the British-made plows on the Leopard 2Rs and Wisent clearly missed more than a few mines. Three Leopard 2Rs and a Wisent struck mines, as did several M-2s. Trapped and under fire, the battlegroup fell apart. Crews bailed out of their disabled vehicles, dragging their dead and wounded with them. A rescue force riding in M-2s scooped up many of the survivors.\n\nIn the hours after the retreat, 47th Brigade chief master sergeant Valerii Markus went on social media to tell critics to \u201cshut your mouths.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe smoke cleared to reveal no fewer than 25 wrecked Ukrainian vehicles: 17 M-2s, four Leopard 2A6 tanks, three Leopard 2Rs and one Wisent. To outside observers, the losses initially seemed lighter. But over the next two weeks, analysts scrutinized drone videos and snapshots from the ground and steadily added to the list.\r  \n\r  \nLosing one Wisent isn\u2019t that big of a deal for the Ukrainian army: it has dozens of the vehicles. But the Ukrainians initially received just a hundred of the versatile M-2s and 21 of the high-tech Leopard 2A6s with their far-firing 55-caliber cannons. And Finland gave Ukraine all six of the Leopard 2Rs.\r  \n\r  \nIn a bloody hour or two, the 47th-33rd Brigade battlegroup lost nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s M-2s, a fifth of its Leopard 2A6s and half its Leopard 2Rs. The United States promptly pledged more than enough extra M-2s to make good the June 8 losses, but Ukraine\u2019s European allies have yet to pony up more Leopard 2A6s. And there literally aren\u2019t any more Leopard 2Rs.\n\nDespite losing the equivalent of an entire battalion in a single botched assault\u2014that\u2019s roughly 15 percent of the combined front-line strength of two brigades\u2014the 33rd and 47th Brigades apparently remain intact ... and still are in the fight.

Since the end of the Cold War, authoritarianism has persisted beyond the departure of a longtime autocratic leader in 76 percent of cases.

Such a strategy should also aim to weaken the grip of authoritarianism in Russia over time.

To weaken these barriers, Washington must properly enforce sanctions on the Kremlin\u2019s cronies in the business world, combat money laundering, make financial and real estate markets in the United States and Europe more transparent, and support investigative journalists in their bid to uncover such corruption. The United States can also bolster Russian civil society, an important force in forging a more liberal and democratic country, beginning with supporting the work of the many actors in Russian civil society\u2014including journalists and members of the opposition\u2014who have fled the country since the start of the war in February 2022.

Support for Ukraine\u2014in the form of sustained military assistance and efforts to anchor the country in the West through membership in the European Union and NATO\u2014will pave the way for improved relations with a new Russia.

His grip on power has tightened and will remain strong for as long as the fighting continues.
