        "body": "Following up on my post yesterday the Afghanistan Green Trend, an anti-Taliban movement founded by former VP Amrullah Saleh has released another report on the Taliban military, this time focused on its ground forces.\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. The Taliban have 145,000 soldiers on payroll (The AGT claims to have full information on <50,000) however most units are actually at \\~40% strength with commanders skimming money from the soldiers by deducting food allowances in exchange for giving them long or indefinite leave.\n2. The only exceptions to this are Panjshir, Andarab, and some areas of Khost in Baghlan province where the Taliban have \\~70% unit strength.\n3. Taliban strength in Pajshir is \\~17,000 soldiers and in Badakhshan, Takhar, Kunduz, Baghlan, Balkh, Juzjan, Sare-Pol, and Faryab they have a further \\~63,000.\n4. The Taliban army remains mostly Pashtun with only \\~7% of soldiers in northern areas being non Pashtuns.\n5. The Taliban are unable to maintain American equipment due to a critical lack of spare parts, the report claims this is in part due to widespread smuggling of equipment and parts to Pakistan mostly shortly after their takeover in 2021 (There is quite a bit of evidence to support this).\n6. AGT claims to have identified at least 700 Taliban soldiers wounded or killed since August 2021 and promises to publish the full list in the future.\n7. The Taliban army remains heavily divided into mostly tribal and provincial lines and has failed to become a cohesive force, instead it remains mostly militia with a small number of professionally trained units.\n\nThis information should obviously not be viewed as totally accurate as the AGT and NRF (In which Saleh is also a high-ranking leader) are currently fighting the Taliban and it is in their interest to portray the Taliban as vulnerable, however many of these points have strong evidence backing them outside of this report and the AGT has been very capable in the past working as Saleh's personal intelligence agency.\n\n[Link to the report](https://x.com/AGTAfghanistan/status/1777649116920611177)",

GEM-T is only in production for Foreign Military Sales customers. Raytheon currently has 500 GEM-T missiles on contract for production at their US facilities, plus 1000 missiles which will be built by their COMLOG joint venture with MBDA Germany. Raytheon expects another 1000 GEM-T orders on top of those 1500.\n\nThis is without knowledge of Japanese production. But current Patriot production sits at ~740 missiles a year.\n\nPerhaps unwise to publicly share this information, but it has been shared. What's now made apparent is that Russian missile production significantly outpaces interceptor production.

It is unfortunate for the Ukrainian situation that interceptor production will take so long to spool up. It further underlines the importance of a few things, in my opinion.\n\n1. Air defense capabilities need to be expanded across NATO. There needs to be more air defense batteries and a significant stockpile of ammunition.\n\n2. Fighter aircraft such as the F-16 will likely be used heavily in defending against Russian missile strikes. Especially as it takes time to ramp up long-range GBAD production. This will take sorties away from the front lines.\n\n3. It is imperative that Russian missile launchers get neutralized. While it will be impossible to destroy Russia's ground-launched options, Russian sea-launched and air-launched platforms need to be targeted and neutralized if Ukraine is to receive a respite.

It's not much, but everything adds up. Hence, Kazakhstan might be pressured to help.\n\n\n[Russia: One dead as bridge collapses on railway tracks](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68766912)\n\n\n>A road bridge has collapsed on railway tracks in western Russia, killing a woman and injuring another five people, local officials say.\n\n\n>All train traffic was halted after Monday's incident in the town of Vyazma, Smolensk region, they say.\n\n\n>About 8,000 households were without gas as pipelines were also damaged.\n\n\nWhat a combo! This minor accident has halted both road, railway and gas transports. This is the main railway between Belarus and Russia, so it's somewhat notable, but it will be fixed quickly.\n\n\nNonetheless, it's unavoidable that Russia spending the infrastructure budget on war production will have negative consequences on maintenance.\n\n\n[Europe exits winter with record gas storage](https://think.ing.com/articles/europe-exits-winter-with-record-gas-storage-050424/)\n\n\n>The 2023/24 northern hemisphere heating season has officially come to an end. Europe has managed to get through the winter months with very comfortable storage levels. In fact, with storage 58% full at the end of March, the region has exited the heating season with record high storage levels. Milder than usual weather through much of February and large parts of March has meant that the drawdown in storage has been somewhat less than expected.\n\n\n>...\n\n\n>Disruptions to remaining Russian pipeline flows is a very real risk. Gazprom\u2019s transit deal expires at the end of this year and Ukraine has made it clear it has no plans to extend the deal. This puts around 50% of remaining Russian pipeline flows at risk. Although, Russia may try push larger volumes through TurkStream. Either way, we expect any potential losses from Russia to be manageable for Europe, given the ramping up of new LNG export capacity later this year and into 2025.\n\n\n>...\n\n\n>European gas demand is still struggling to make a strong recovery despite the broader weakness seen in European gas prices. EU gas demand in 2023 totalled a little over 330bcm, down 7% YoY and 20% lower than 2021 (pre-war) levels. More recently, demand over January-February was up 1% YoY (January was up 9% YoY, while milder weather in February saw demand 8% lower YoY), so we are seeing signs of demand finally starting to recover. In fact, since October, three out of five months have seen YoY growth in gas demand \u2013 although the region is still obviously well below its five-year average. We expect weaker prices and lower volatility to continue to drive a recovery in industrial demand through the year. We also expect the power sector to be less of a drag on gas demand this year.\n\n\nMeanwhile, it's quite clear that Europe doesn't need Russian gas. Furthermore, European gas demand is recovering. Gas has significantly lower levies than electricity in Europe, so direct gas use is more attractive than in China and even the US. This is a bad policy, but it seems to be impossible to change.",

The Anti-Ukraine ppl will vote far left and far right instead but he could have gotten some actual unity in his coalition with big PR gains and a position of strength which would have given him additional personal points.\n\nI am wondering if political consultants have something to do with this like when Angela Merkel had Erich Vad as Security Consultant who has repeatedly revealed positions bordering high treason traitorous sentiments at this point same as Harald Kujat. Not a conspiracy just disgusted at what the high brass actually think and how this could be and ofc I know that the majority of upper staff probably does not fall into that camp.",
