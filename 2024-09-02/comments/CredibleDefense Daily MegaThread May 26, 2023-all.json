After months of pressure from Kyiv and allied governments, Biden announced last week that the US would support efforts to train Ukrainian pilots to use the jets.\n\n>The Netherlands and Denmark are leading the coalition to prepare the pilots, with the support of the UK and Belgium. The Dutch government is already looking into and discussing with its allies possible deployment plans, one of the people said. Despite the willingness of the Dutch government to help beef up Ukrainian air defenses \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d pilot training and mapping out deployment and logistics could take many months. \n\n>The Netherlands currently has 42 F-16 fighter jets in its inventory, 24 of which are currently being used by the Dutch army and cannot be sent to Ukraine until mid-2024. A dozen of the other 18 jets were to be sold to Draken International but the government delayed the transfer of the aircraft in December without disclosing an explanation, citing commercial confidentiality. \n\n>Although the final decision on deployment has not yet been made, Ukraine may get some of the jets that are on sale or some of the currently operational 24 jets next year depending on the training timeline, the people said. The Netherlands keeps all its F-16 jets airworthy through regular maintenance. \n\n>A spokeswoman for the Dutch defense ministry said Thursday the government would consider the possible delivery of F-16s to Ukraine at a later date. Pilot training is the priority now, she added. \n\n>Earlier this month, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said there are \u201cno taboos\u201d against sending fighter jets to Ukraine. Rutte\u2019s office declined to comment on the possibility of F-16 deployment.\n\n>US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has said the US would work with allies in coming months to determine when the planes will be delivered, and who will do so. The likeliest scenario for now is that the US won\u2019t send F-16s to Ukraine but instead rely on other countries to supply them.\n\n>US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Thursday the US notes \u201cDutch leadership in coordinating and leveraging the capabilities of other allies to provide important assistance to Ukraine\u201d after a phone conversation with Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren, according to Austin\u2019s office. Austin thanked Ollongren for Dutch security aid to Kyiv.\n\n>The Netherlands has so far provided around \u20ac1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) in military support to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, with delivered equipment alone accounting for \u20ac732 million, according to the Dutch defense ministry.",

A big issue with the LCS was lets make a small cheap warship but then we want it to be configurable to do a million different roles like a warship Lego set.

If you want VLS you probably have to choose if you want it more land attack vs naval strike vs air defense you want it to be.

Should they fall into the hands of the adverse Party, their personnel shall be free to pursue their duties, as long as the capturing Power has not itself ensured the necessary care of the wounded and sick found in such establishments and units.\n\nThe responsible authorities shall ensure that the said medical establishments and units are, as far as possible, situated in such a manner that attacks against military objectives cannot imperil their safety.\n\n\u2026\n\nArticle 21\n\nThe protection to which fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the Medical Service are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after a due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded.\n\nArticle 22\n\nThe following conditions shall not be considered as depriving a medical unit or establishment of the protection guaranteed by Article 19:\n\n1.

So obviously there is a need to counter that. But how? I do not see a clearly superior technology emerging yet. \n\nA lot of anti-drone tech is for police over in friendly urban areas, and tries to bring down the drone safely, with jamming or nets. But we do not have that restriction in combat, and it limits range and effectiveness. And jamming is a game of cat and mouse over the frequency spectrum.   \n\nDestroying the drones proves tricky: bullets cannot hit a small moving target, shotguns do not have the range, guided missiles are not cost effective. \n\nLasers could work, but modern systems seem too heavy for infantry units to carry. \n\nSo we need something new and radical.  And here I get less credible and make an analogy with human-piloted aviation. First, the aircraft was used for observation. Then for dropping weapons on enemy. And finally for air superiority. I remember reading that some early biplane pilots tried shooting handguns at enemy planes, or damaging them with own propeller, which was rapidly followed by emergence of dedicated fighter airplanes. \n\nI wonder if drones are entering the third phase; we already seen a video of one drone ramming another. So the question is whether we will see drones built mainly to take down other drones. \n\nIt does not seem entirely implausible: anti-drone will need a guidance system, which will be costly but reusable (unlike a missile). Once they get close enough to enemy drone, we need to attack it. If machine gun is too heavy, then maybe a shotgun, or an MetalStorm tube. I know recoil will wreak havoc with flying, so the drone would have to be built around the gun, much like A-10 was built around its cannon.\n\nSo should it post this to NCD, or there is some grain of plausibility?",

Virtually no Pz-III or IV are available, nor does Germany have access to the Pz-35t/38t. The panzer divisions are also weaker organisationally and less capable of the sustained operations that succeeded in France, having not yet benefited from the additional infantry units added after Poland or the doctrinal lessons learnt during 1938-9.\n\nFrench command and control obviously still had issues, but in 1939 Germany is simply not in a position to capitalise on these issues as they did in 1940. Additionally, Germany simply lacks the divisions to both prosecute a successful campaign in Czechoslovakia and man the Westwall, so France has an opportunity here to launch an offensive into Germany's relatively undefended industrial heartland.

In fact these shortcomings were so apparent that after Munich Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to be expanded fivefold.\n\nBritain needed time because it's interwar defence cuts had crippled the army and badly hamstrung the airforce, but honestly in 1938 Britain just isn't that relevant militarily to a potential war. France won't go to war without Britain, and vice versa, but that's largely for political and diplomatic reasons. \n\nAny way you slice it, while Britain and France certainly weren't *prepared* for war, Germany was in an even worse position in 1938 - and knew it.",

Setting this stuff up can take years, even when you want to do it. Obviously you cant just grab a McDonalds worker Monday, and Friday have them filling shells. Lots of specialized training so you dont kill everyone, make the shells right, etc. But thats doable, and its being done now in many places.

If you can get more 81mm mortar ammo, someone will shoot it. \n\nThe other headache is the mixing of systems. A 155mm shell cant fit into a 152mm gun, and some ammo in the same size from country A may not work with a gun from country B. Within NATO thats not as painful, thanks to STANAGs. But putting NATO ammo in a Soviet gun from the 1960s may not give you the desired result. Or it might. Depends. What Ukraine is really hurting for is *Soviet* style ammo and thats hard to come by in the west. In most every case, when given the option countries have moved to NATO standard ammunition types rather than Soviet for this very reason.

Add on another layer of complexity, if youre the US where are your limited Ukraine dollars better spent, building new factories for 152mm shells, or buying more M109s and M777s to get the UA to whatever you already have?\n\nAnd then there are logistics problems. You have the shells, theyre made, how do you ship them over to Kyiv or wherever? A 152mm round is something like 4x the volume (including powder) of a 122mm, and the numbers between 105mm and 155mm are even worse. Its one thing to take delivery of 100k 155mm shells, another entirely to ship them from Kyiv to (I assume) Greece, put them on a train to Romania, and then turn them over at the border to Ukraine. Who then has to ship them. So there is a throughput problem as well that is even harder to address. Is Poland going to pay double the capacity of the Danzig-Kyiv railroad, or are they okay with things as it is now even if that means that fewer shells per month reach the front line? \n\nSo you have a clear solution.

And I rather like that. \n\nWith a modern FCS, you can generally anticipate a 90% hit rate, stationary against stationary, inside 3000yds. With modern KE rounds its likely a hit will cause at least a mission kill, tho it depends heavily. Western tanks are very well armored and likely to survive a KE hit at all but close (under 1000m range). A T-72.... not so much, a hit is likely to cause a penetration, a penetration will very very likely cause an ammo explosion. Typically the rule of thumb is 1.5 casualties per penetration, but with the T-72 (really all Soviet tanks with an autolader) its hard to know where Russia is on this. Stationary on stationary, front to front, T-72 vs. T-72 as is very common in this war, it is very likely the first tank to shoot will both hit the enemy first, and kill them or force them to withdraw first. \n\nBut war is never that easy, and thats where a ton of these statistics start to break down. As tanks begin to move the odds of a first round hit, from or against, drop. I want to say its like 60%ish for a first round hit, but Id have to go back and look. A hull down tank is two thirds less likely to be hit from an incoming round, with no loss to their own firing capability. Weve seen in this war that when tanks are used, especially out of a fixed position, both sides have learned how to keep them moving and keep them fighting. I saw one video maybe 6mo ago of a tank using multiple fighting positions and a trench connecting them. It would spot from one, drive to the next, shoot, pull back, and then spot from a third. Rinse, repeat. Very clever stuff. But stuff like that is designed to maximize your first round hit probability while minimizing incoming risk. Thats the ideal tho. Ive seen other vids where a tank wanders down the wrong alley in a town and gets blapped at near point blank range where there is no hope of missing or bouncing the shot. \n\nThe tactical alignment then is what really determines the answer to what youre asking, and thats going to change radically from one day to the next.",

However if you really need to make a pin-point shot at 4km, ATGM might allow you do that much more easily. </p>\n\n<p>But ATGMs are much cheaper and lighter, easier to use and far more easier to maintain. And in the end, it will be the skill of the crew and the outside support (ISR, C2) that will determine whether your vehicle is in the position to be first to find the opponent and fire a shot.</p>\n</div>",

Another thing you can look at is the breakdown of religions by region; the data is all over the place. Especially when you consider how there's so much variance between each survey. Some surveys in 2000 show around 40% for orthodox christianity, and some of the recent ones go up to 70%+. Overall religiosity is falling in the developed world, which is true for Russia too; but there's a lot more variance.\n\nFor example [this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20170905105138/https://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Slide13-6.jpg) is from 2017 conducted by an international French-based survey group: \n\n[This one](I had to delete link here because it leads to russian domain source and so reddit removed my whole comment, so PM if you really need it) is from 2022 conducted by a state owned group. A pretty big mismatch especially when one should keep in mind that there's also a 5 year difference between them that should bias towards less religiosity not more(if you accept the general trend of developed world becoming less religious over time). \n\nThere's a lot of other surveys if that one doesn't satisfy you(French one only had ~1k people, don't know about methodology), but point is that if you look across a few of them you find very mismatched data; not like 5-10% discrepancies as is usually the case.\n\n>They might be migrating to central regions.\n\nThat makes sense to me, but the same is going to be true of ethnic Russians as well. The question is what is the net exchange rate between the two groups. And the most important is how much influence does the state apparatus exert on one's identity? Every multi-ethnic state has had to contend with this, and it's very rare for the state to actually support its ethnic minorities. Since there's a ton of overlap between ethnicities and most data is self reported, and there's most certainly some sort of pressure on declaring yourself Russian(either state-sponsored / political, or simply cultural) then that would lead to more ethnic Russians appearing on data.\n\n>The research indicated that ethnic minorities are in fact very slightly overrepresented, if at all.\n\nThe study basically says there is a slight overrepresentation but that it's mostly explained by socio-economic differences, like I asked. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. It's also not just minorities being underrepresented, St.Petersburg and Moscow Russians are underrepresented. One can't use the socioeconomic explanation for that.\n\nAll of that said, I don't know why you think Russia would be any different to any other multi-ethnic state in how it deals with its minorities. Sure it's the 21th century, and there's some big counterexamples we can put forward; like UK and USA, or maybe even Canada and Singapore. But all of these countries have had some pretty terrible practices in just the last 50 years. Russia is a country where the average life of a citizen compared to most of these countries is about ~8x times lower(even if you adjust for PPP, just look at insurance data). A country where the ultranationalist faction is constantly given a platform, even when they end up being the opposition(Navalny is a nationalist and doesn't like minorities), etc.",

Now look at China, is there a peaceful dissolution of the regime? No, it fights back the liberal movement and the regime stays in power.\n\nOne can argue that China also 'folded' in terms of ideology, because they embraced capitalism, etc. but they're utilizing it in a different way and more importantly the regime has stayed in power an continues to exert particular social/cultural values, not the same in Russia.\n\nWhat did we do in west when cold war ended? We massively invested into China and largely ignored Russia, I think this was a big blunder. Maybe it was just greed and trying to capture as many markets as possible as fast as possible, I don't know; but whatever the reason, not focusing on Russia was a mistake. Think of the Marshall plan and Germany, perhaps an even better comparison is with Yugoslavia; which was a communist state that was playing both west/east against each other; yet in the end west had another Marshall-plan equivalent ready for Yugoslavia. Russia did not enjoy this sort of thing, there were investments and some trade deals done; but this was very one sided and not motivated by actually bringing Russia back into the fold.\n\nIf Russia and its puppet states(namely Ukraine, Belarus) had a better time transitioning to capitalism, I think there would be a far greater chance of linkage occurring, this was sort of the belief that it would happen automatically anyway. \n\nThere's a lot of neolibs here who are going to hate to hear this, but the fall of communism and transition to market economies did not go splendidly well for everyone. I think a big factor of this war is ideological and that goes back to the dissolution of the USSR. Perhaps, ironically; Russia had the best time transitioning(in regards to its vassal states). Ukraine was hit the hardest, and contrary to most situations in the world; with exception of Kyiv and maybe a city or two more, western Ukraine is poorer than eastern Ukraine. There was strong resentment building up in western Ukraine over the handling of the transition, the favorable view of West(especially of EU, because of how much success Poland had after its transition). \n\nGranted, a lot of these developments could probably not be seen back then. I would also drive the parallel with Yugoslavia. Russia was to USSR, what Serbia was to Yugoslavia. Losing a place of power and control built up a lot of resentment in some nationalist/imperialist factions, and while overall these factions are not big; they still have had strong political influences. In Serbia this manifested very suddenly after the fall, Russia largely dodged this but eventually the chickens have to come home to roost. \n\nPutin was largely seen as a *moderate* by majority of Russians, let that sink in. He was seen as someone who would control the various factions that were more extreme, but he still let them have a voice; because obviously you need to let them be heard lest they think you're not on their side. Kremlin's state jester(Zhirinovsky) was one such ultranationalist who would be given a lot of attention, even though he blabbered about the most insane stuff; but at the same time he'd give stage to these crazy ideas. And all of that goes back 20years+. Also worth looking at the 'opposition' the so called liberal democrats of Russia of which Navalny takes the center stage. He has on record said plenty of ultranationalist things or even imperialist that you wouldn't expect, yet he is seen as this great savior of Russian democracy, etc.",

But from the currently still ongoing Leopard 2PL program and the plans for a possible Leopard 2A5 upgrade it appears like Poland wants to keep them for atleast another decade\n\nI know the M1s are not supposed to be fully delivered until 2026; that includes the 116 older model M1A1s and 250 M1A2s. The 180 Korean manufactured K2s are also supposed to have all been delivered by 2026 as well. So that's 546 tanks.\n\nPoland has donated (or committed) roughly 290 T-72s and 60 PT-91s to Ukraine for a total of 350 tanks. They had 172 PT-91s, and 300 operating / 100 stored T-72s prior to their donations. I think it's a safe bet all their T-72s have been donated either whole or for parts, which would leave about 112 PT-91s still in service. If they donate those - the board indicates Poland is moving away from them, so they could - that would mean they would need to replace 462 tanks that were in service and 100 of the stored tanks. Which would be 562. \n\nLooking at it like that, keeping their Leopards in service for another decade provides security in case of lag times. The K2PL is supposed to start production in 2026 but that timeline could slip for a number of reasons. Even if it doesn't, the 116 M1A1s could be rotated to be upgraded to the M1A2 SEPV3s (or whatever) without loss of security. \n\nPoland might also be looking at just keeping their Leopard plant rolling in case Rheinmetall can't get their Ukraine running, and they could service Ukraine's Leopards and Abrams (well, the APS depot in Poland).",

Sections in the State Department share the Pentagon's views. Eisenhower and Dulles disagree, but, ladies and gentlemen, no matter how strong the position of the American President, he must also heed public opinion. There is a very serious danger that the United States will change their whole policy towards Europe and retreat to peripheral defence. The danger is all the greater - and this is not intended for the public either - because people in the Pentagon are of the opinion that the development of nuclear technology, both in aircraft and, of course, in submarines, will in the near future come to the United States - there is talk of a year or two - regardless of using a country in Europe as a base.

Forgive me, Herr Gradl, if I say this so bluntly, we also have an obligation to the people. (Gradl: I've never disputed that!) The others are disgustingly off. We have come into danger. Now we want to secure ourselves, and then comes the other. I don't want to say that this is an intermediate stage. We do not have one goal, we have two goals, but they converge in the endeavor to create a reunited Germany in peace and freedom.\n\n>Now to the question of reunification! Ladies and gentlemen! I believe every word in this circle about the fact that one can never do without reunification is superfluous. The only question is how do we achieve reunification? We all agree that it should not be brought about by force. I welcome the fact that the representative of the BHE in the Bundestag expressly made a statement to that effect during this speech battle last week; for there was always the big question mark, both among the English and especially among the French, whether the Federal Republic, under pressure from the expellees, as soon as it had arms, would not one day try to bring about reunification by force.\n\n>But we are - and this is very important - now a member of NATO. At EVG we would only have done so indirectly. But it would have been all other EVG countries and not us! NATO decides how troops are deployed.

If you notice, the protests against governments that become popular in English-speaking media are ones where the government is among the enemies of the US. I will give you two examples of this.\n\nFirst, during the last big protests in Belarus, there were also protests in Bulgaria. What sparked the protests was video proof of unconstitutional occupation of Bulgarian land on the beach by a political party that controls part of the country through feudal relations and that is guarded by guards who refused to legitimize themselves (they are obliged to) and who ended up being from the ranks of the National Security Service, essentially bodyguards. The way the government dealt with the protests was violent, dismissive and until this day, nothing happened with that situation. The beach is still occupied. The government back then was led by a different party but that party also feudalizes the country in places they control.

In all cases we have legitimate reason for unrest. In all cases we have repression of that unrest. Yet, the focus is on countries that are for one reason or another against the plans of the US.\n\nThere is also the question - there is direct and indirect proof that foreign powers assist, if not outright support, political entities that fight tyrannical governments. Foreign powers such as the US, Russia etc. I mean, the EU Commission literally expressed support for the democratic change in Belarus.

What sparked the protests was video proof of unconstitutional occupation of Bulgarian land on the beach by a political party that controls part of the country through feudal relations and that is guarded by guards who refused to legitimize themselves (they are obliged to) and who ended up being from the ranks of the National Security Service, essentially bodyguards.

But some are regime propagandists who welcome their country\u2019s transformation into a vassal state.</p>\n\n<p>Two of them, Mitya Olshansky and Yegor Kholmogorov, explained \u201cwhy Russia in the 21st century should become a vassal of China and not the USA.\u201d According to them, \u201cChina, in contrast to America, aspires to acquire our resources, but not to change our identity.\u201d The two Russian \u201cimperial nationalists,\u201d as one site describes them, don\u2019t question Russia\u2019s degradation to vassalage. They just prefer China\u2019s being Russia\u2019s lord to America\u2019s, even though Chinese overlordship is likely to make Russia significantly poorer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many Russian nationalists are actually happy to become vassals to China. It&#39;s mostly liberals who are against.</p>\n</div>",
