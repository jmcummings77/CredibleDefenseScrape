She received a degree called the Candidate of Economic Sciences, which is a postgraduate level degree.\n\nHer current position as you mentioned is the Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation. Her husband, Sergey Tsililev, is the Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, and the former Governor of the Kemerovo Oblast. She holds two awards from Russia, one for Service to Kuzbass and another as an Honorary Citizen of Kuzbass. Moving on to a bit more detail.\n\nHer father, Yevgeny Mikailovich Putin, was a urologist, and she was born into a family of surgeons. She graduated from Ivanovo State Medical Academy as a psychiatrist and worked at the Bogorodskoye Psychiatric Hospital from 1996. After Vladimir Putin came to power, she moved to Moscow and began working in medical equipment supplies, first as a manager at the state-owned Medtekhsnab and later a private company Digimed.\n\nShe furthered her education, earning degrees in healthcare organization and public health from RUDN and in organization management at GUU. In 2016-2018, she was the CEO and Chairman for the Board of Directors of the Swiss company Kolmar Sales and Logistics. In March of 2018, she became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Kolmar Group, a major coal mining firm, receiving a large share of the company from her husband, who was then appointed Governor of the Kemerovo Oblast.\n\nOn the 30th of November, 2018, she headed the Council for Trusteeship in the Social Sphere of Kuzbass, focusing on social support for various population categories. Since 2019, she has been a member of the Council under the Government of the Russian Federation on guardianship issues in the social sphere.\n\nOn the 3rd of April, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a degree establishing the State Fund for Support of Participants in the Special Military Operation \"Defenders of the Fatherland\", appointing her as the Chairperson. Just today, she was obviously appointed as a Deputy Minister of Defense of Russia, where her role will be more focused on the social and housing support aspects of military personnel.\n\nShe has been sanctioned, on the 29th of June, 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she and the Kolmar Group were included in British sanctions due to benefits she received derived from her relationship with President Putin. On the 18th of December, 2023, she and the Defenders of the Fatherland foundation were sanctioned by the EU for their role in supporting the war in Ukraine. She is also on lists of sanctions in Ukraine and Switzerland.\n\nShe owns 70 percent of the Kolmar Group, and investigations have revealed that she and her husband were not wealthy before Putin came to power, however in 2012 Putin's friend Gennady Timchenko sold them the Kolmar company for a symbolic price. The company then received over 11 billion rubles in state financial assistance, helping the company to grow rapidly.\n\nWith all that being said, she's benefited from his corruption in the past, but she will not really be overseeing actual military operations in logistic terms, more the \"social and housing support\" as they term it.

During the August Coup in 1991, the State Committee on the State of Emergency (aka the \"Gang of Eight\" leading the coup) included the head of the KGB, the defense minister, and the deputy chairman of the defense council of the USSR. Among those prosecuted for the coup was Valentin Varennikov, who was General of the Army, Deputy Minister of Defense, and Commander of Land Forces. General Pavel Grachev of the VDV organized the plan for establishing martial law. On the first day of the coup, after KGB border troops seized Gorbachev at his dacha, Soviet Air Defense Chief of Staff Colonel-General Igor Maltsev ordered his troops to block the runway on which Gorbachev's official plane and helicopter were located. Shortly thereafter, the gang of eight ordered units of the Tamanskaya mechanized infantry, the Kantemirovskaya armored division, and the VDV into Moscow, which amounted to around 4,000 soldiers equipped with 350 tanks, 300 APCs, and 420 trucks.\n\nWhile the coup failed, it came perilously close to succeeding, and only the seemingly inexplicable failure of a KGB Alfa team to arrest Yeltsin doomed the enterprise. It isn't unreasonable to think that Putin has taken lessons from that coup, and recognizes the essential role the military played in securing Moscow, the Kremlin, and other locations critical to maintaining control over the USSR. Without the army, the KGB would not have had sufficient manpower to achieve those objectives across the entire USSR.\n\nThere are many other examples of the uneasy relationship between Russian military power and state stability, but just to cover the most obvious and important: Stalin's purges weren't just a product of his paranoia but were a somewhat rational reaction to the persistent threat to his rule posed by popular generals. He recognized that the military represented one of the only potential centers of gravity around which challenges to his otherwise firm grip on power might coalesce, and used the purges to keep Red Army officers perpetually off balance to prevent such a center of gravity from forming in the first place. Putin has similarly kept the military in a state of disarray under incompetent leadership, which is a large part of the explanation for your subsequent point:\n\n> and even now it lacks any notable officers with enough clout and independence to be a threat.\n\nIn other words, the absence of those notable officers is precisely a result of Putin's fear of the military and of empowering a popular general sufficiently to challenge his rule, not a sign that Putin has nothing to fear. Moreover the absence of any notable officers does not preclude the possibility of an unusually capable but unknown leader rising to power quickly during a coup, nor does it preclude other, more politicized factions with more capable leaders from recruiting the MOD for their own purposes. \n\nSo Putin clearly very much does fear the military, just as he fears the security services. That's why Rosgvardia exists, to protect the regime against any Prigozhin-style internal military threats. Putin plays the security services, the military, and Rosgvardia all off against each other, preventing any one faction from gaining sufficient power to overthrow him by dividing responsibilities and resources strategically between them.",

At no point did I ever get think Israel could not occupy Gaza. The mistake I did make at the onset of this war was to believe that Hamas would cause much more trouble for Israel's operations than it did. However, I was still operating on the presumption that Israel would eventually occupy Gaza given enough time, firepower, and manpower; the stark difference in conventional military capabilities between Hamas and Israel basically guaranteed this on a large enough timescale.\n\nThe key for me has always been cost and timespan; this is a key aspect of my analysis. The initial operations and occupations would incur costs, the establishment of a longer-term military occupation will incur costs, and the maintenance of this occupation will continue to incur costs as long as the occupation is maintained. These ongoing costs could potentially vary with the intensiveness of resistance and insurgency, which could be minor at times and more intense at others, depending on the state of Palestinian insurgent forces, Israeli occupational forces, and Iranian capability to supply the aforementioned insurgent forces. These three can vary independently across time, as can the effectiveness of blockade efforts. Humans gets lax after settling into routines in the long term; 10/7 is a horrific example of this.\n\nI think one core disconnect between our two perspectives is that you are approaching the costs of this long-term, ongoing occupation from the perspective of tradeoffs with security costs of allowing Hamas to continue to operate, i.e. ongoing attacks. I'm approaching the costs of this from the perspective of a potential solution to this conflict, i.e. ending the need for insecurity altogether. In other words, you view the ongoing costs of occupation as worth it instead of the ongoing costs of potential future attacks; I view the ongoing costs of occupation as not worth it instead of pursuing a permanent solution.\n\nI don't think the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza gave peace a sufficient chance because I believe the ongoing Israeli presence in the West Bank continued to fuel hostilities among enough Palestinians to build support for Hamas, or at the very least incentivize them to look the other way. You believe (at least I think you do) that the 2005 withdrawal was a sufficient demonstration of goodwill, and that further withdrawal from the West Bank would be a wasted effort if Palestinians in Gaza were so willing to continue supporting Hamas after said demonstration.

The Islamic Republic of Iran will also be an an ongoing issue that wasn't present pre-Oslo; it didn't exist prior to 1979 and between 1980 and 1988 it was busy fighting Saddam.\n\nI could also go into the multitude of factors that involved the US in the Middle East from the 1970s onward, factors which are waning or no longer exist, but I think my comment has gone on long enough.",
                                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m going to dial back my tone and try to establish a modicum of common ground because I suspect you and I can keep going on this for quite a while and our interactions are growing in hostility.</p>\n\n<p>So to address your recap:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Israel cannot hold Gaza under military control</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has not been my argument, but if this was the impression you got then that might have been my fault for not elaborating. At no point did I ever get think Israel could not occupy Gaza. The mistake I did make at the onset of this war was to believe that Hamas would cause much more trouble for Israel&#39;s operations than it did. However, I was still operating on the presumption that Israel would eventually occupy Gaza given enough time, firepower, and manpower; the stark difference in conventional military capabilities between Hamas and Israel basically guaranteed this on a large enough timescale.</p>\n\n<p>The key for me has always been cost and timespan; this is a key aspect of my analysis. The initial operations and occupations would incur costs, the establishment of a longer-term military occupation will incur costs, and the maintenance of this occupation will continue to incur costs as long as the occupation is maintained. These ongoing costs could potentially vary with the intensiveness of resistance and insurgency, which could be minor at times and more intense at others, depending on the state of Palestinian insurgent forces, Israeli occupational forces, and Iranian capability to supply the aforementioned insurgent forces. These three can vary independently across time, as can the effectiveness of blockade efforts. Humans gets lax after settling into routines in the long term; 10/7 is a horrific example of this.</p>\n\n<p>I think one core disconnect between our two perspectives is that you are approaching the costs of this long-term, ongoing occupation from the perspective of tradeoffs with security costs of allowing Hamas to continue to operate, i.e. ongoing attacks. I&#39;m approaching the costs of this from the perspective of a potential solution to this conflict, i.e. ending the need for insecurity altogether. In other words, you view the ongoing costs of occupation as worth it instead of the ongoing costs of potential future attacks; I view the ongoing costs of occupation as not worth it instead of pursuing a permanent solution.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think the 2005 withdrawal from Gaza gave peace a sufficient chance because I believe the ongoing Israeli presence in the West Bank continued to fuel hostilities among enough Palestinians to build support for Hamas, or at the very least incentivize them to look the other way. You believe (at least I think you do) that the 2005 withdrawal was a sufficient demonstration of goodwill, and that further withdrawal from the West Bank would be a wasted effort if Palestinians in Gaza were so willing to continue supporting Hamas after said demonstration. I think these are largely irreconcilable positions that we&#39;ll never know the answer to, so I don&#39;t think any more words need to be spent on this point in particular.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose it&#39;s ironic that I&#39;m holding onto an optimistic endgame as a generally pessimistic person.

Will the ability of these drones to be operated from anywhere in the world help Ukraine regain some of it's manpower from abroad without actually bringing them back?\n\n[\u200bWhat Characteristics Has Ratel Ukrainian Combat Robot that Controlled Via Starlink? | Defense Express | June 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/what_characteristics_has_ratel_ukrainian_combat_robot_that_controlled_via_starlink-10872.html)\n\n*The Defense Forces of Ukraine are currently using a number of different Ukrainian-made robotic platforms on the battlefield, including the Ratel series. Defense Express talked to the head of this company, Ukrainian serviceman Taras Ostapchuk. He told about how these combat robots are currently being improved, based on the results of their operation in battles against Russian occupation forces.*\n\n*As of today, Ukrainian warriors use four types of Ratel platforms. These are kamikaze drones, evacuation platforms, logistics platforms, as well as remote miner. According to Ostapchuk, the company is constantly responding to operators' feedback. Now the fifth updating of these robotic platforms is being used at the frontline. At the same time the sixth is on the way with the corresponding improvements.*\n\n*It is important that Ratel ground drones can be controlled from a completely safe location. \"Our platforms have been used with Starlink for more than six months. Our operator can be located anywhere in the world and manage the platform,\" Ostapchuk emphasizes.*\n\n*Of course, drones have their limitations in terms of range. For instance, the average distance of a remote \"miner\" is approximately 3 km, while a record of 30 km was set for the evacuation platform.*\n\n*As Ostapchuk explains, this refers to the range of the platform with a load of three people, which is about 450 kg. In addition, Ratel platforms are multifunctional. \"We are currently developing a superstructure (for the logistics platform) that will carry 10 anti-tank mines to mine the area,\" the military says.*\n\n*\"As of now, we have direct contracts with military units. We are also at the final stage of signing an agreement with the Ministry of Digital Transformation and the Defense Procurement Agency. Brave1 helps with this. In fact, they manage the demand and government orders,\" Ostapchuk notes.*\n\n*Earlier Defense Express reported that Ukraine had presented versatile ARK-1 robot that offers a multifaceted defense solution.*",

He told about how these combat robots are currently being improved, based on the results of their operation in battles against Russian occupation forces.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>As of today, Ukrainian warriors use four types of Ratel platforms. These are kamikaze drones, evacuation platforms, logistics platforms, as well as remote miner. According to Ostapchuk, the company is constantly responding to operators&#39; feedback. Now the fifth updating of these robotic platforms is being used at the frontline. At the same time the sixth is on the way with the corresponding improvements.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It is important that Ratel ground drones can be controlled from a completely safe location. &quot;Our platforms have been used with Starlink for more than six months. Our operator can be located anywhere in the world and manage the platform,&quot; Ostapchuk emphasizes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Of course, drones have their limitations in terms of range. For instance, the average distance of a remote &quot;miner&quot; is approximately 3 km, while a record of 30 km was set for the evacuation platform.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>As Ostapchuk explains, this refers to the range of the platform with a load of three people, which is about 450 kg. In addition, Ratel platforms are multifunctional. &quot;We are currently developing a superstructure (for the logistics platform) that will carry 10 anti-tank mines to mine the area,&quot; the military says.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;As of now, we have direct contracts with military units. We are also at the final stage of signing an agreement with the Ministry of Digital Transformation and the Defense Procurement Agency. Brave1 helps with this. In fact, they manage the demand and government orders,&quot; Ostapchuk notes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Earlier Defense Express reported that Ukraine had presented versatile ARK-1 robot that offers a multifaceted defense solution.</em></p>\n</div>",

What they are afraid of is the collapse of Russia in the exact same way the Soviet Union collapsed ad fractured after the defeat in Afghanistan. Is this unlikely in the event of a Russian defeat? Yes absolutely. But it\u2019s far from impossible. The authority of Putin and any authoritarian leader depends on the support of the military. Less than a year ago we saw a sizable portion of that military initiate an armed insurrection and begin marching on Moscow with the stated goal of changing national leadership. And we saw units of the Russian national guard simply let them pass. You cannot possibly claim that the Russian state is now so stable that another such event is impossible, especially if the Russian military is actually defeated in Ukraine and not just held to a stalemate. To be clear I\u2019m not saying that Anders is correct, or that such a strategy is a good idea and not a narcissistic fallacy of overestimating your own abilities to influence a situation.

What they are afraid of is the collapse of Russia in the exact same way the Soviet Union collapsed ad fractured after the defeat in Afghanistan. Is this unlikely in the event of a Russian defeat? Yes absolutely. But it\u2019s far from impossible. The authority of Putin and any authoritarian leader depends on the support of the military. Less than a year ago we saw a sizable portion of that military initiate an armed insurrection and begin marching on Moscow with the stated goal of changing national leadership. And we saw units of the Russian national guard simply let them pass. You cannot possibly claim that the Russian state is now so stable that another such event is impossible, especially if the Russian military is actually defeated in Ukraine and not just held to a stalemate. To be clear I\u2019m not saying that Anders is correct, or that such a strategy is a good idea and not a narcissistic fallacy of overestimating your own abilities to influence a situation. But the risk of a general Russian collapse or a violent regime change are both very real, it\u2019s just that the US probably cannot do anything to prevent such a collapse if it is likely to occur.</p>\n</div>",
