This means training, equipping, and mobilizing new forces. It means convincing the Kremlin that continuing the war will become increasingly risky to Russia over time. And it means establishing a position of sufficient strength to be able to set forth, on Ukraine\u2019s own terms, the parameters of a lasting peace.\n\nand is, in my opinion at least, pretty uncontroversial. As usual the devil is in the details. One such is the claim\n\n>The United States and its NATO allies will need to make explicit long-term commitments\n\nwhich seems impossible in the United States given the current political climate. The idea of Biden being able to make a credible, enduring, commitment at this point in time is utterly unbelievable. \n\nOn the upcoming Russian offensive and the state of Russian forces\n\n> Talk of a new Russian offensive may conjure up images of tank units assaulting Ukrainian lines, breaking through, and then trying to exploit those gains deep into Ukrainian-held territory in order to cut off Ukrainian units. But Russia\u2019s forces are not currently able to carry out these kinds of operations, nor do they intend to. After more than two years of war, Russia\u2019s army has suffered heavy losses among its officer core, and its ability to plan and synchronize large-scale attacks is limited. Russian attacks mainly consist of successive assaults at platoon and company scale, resulting in slow advances with heavy losses.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how to square this with the opening assaults on Avdiivka which saw them lose about an entire brigade's worth of armor. Are the platoon/company scale assaults truly a lack of ability or a preference? \n\n>Ukrainian forces have often been forced to expend significant resources defending costly single positions, simply to shield civilian settlements from coming into Russian glide-bomb range.\n\nI don't believe I've seen this take on the glide bombs before. Has there been a significant amount of glide bomb strikes on major civilian areas? I've only seen the hits on trench lines but haven't been tracking this issue myself. \n\nOn the status of Ukrainian reserves of both men and materiel\n\n>Ukraine has few reserves and has lost many of the tactical vehicles needed to exploit Russian vulnerabilities soon after they take positions. Lacking the reserves to counterattack, Ukraine must settle for maximizing Russia\u2019s losses for each position it takes, thereby slowing down its rate of advance.\n\nThe second-order effect of the US aid package\n\n>Other than the immediate provision of ammunition, the greatest effect of the new U.S. aid package is the certainty it offers. After months in which the timing and amount of U.S. support was in doubt, Ukraine will now have enough clarity about military resources for the next six months to allow for broader strategic planning.\n\nThis is a very real benefit. Significant uncertainty about resourcing is a paralytic. The recent Brussels Sprouts podcast with Kofman featured a brief sidebar about how people were unable to make plans extending very far into the future, even in their personal lives. \n\n\nPredictions about the future\n\n> Russia will likely be most dangerous in the final months of 2024. By that point, having weathered months of Russian offensive operations, Ukrainian forces will be stretched thin, their air defenses depleted. Russia will likely have enough troops to rotate its units to allow for successive offensives in the fall.\n\n> But Russian capabilities are not unlimited. Moscow has made some industrial and military choices that are likely to restrict its offensive potential over the course of 2025. For one, it has decided not to expand production of artillery barrels, with the result that fewer new guns will be available next year. Based on the current loss rate, Russian stockpiles of armored vehicles will also likely be depleted by the second half of 2025. \n\nThis seems to track pretty well with what other analysts are saying but I'm curious why the AD situation is expected to still be terrible. The example of how barrel production will work to constrain Russian replenishment is quite interesting and surprising. Did they do this because it was easier to just strip barrels from their legacy stocks? \n\nThe piece takes for granted the idea that the war will end in a negotiated settlement which I don't think is nearly as hot a take it was a year ago. Critically however it assesses Russian willingness to negotiate seriously as\n\n>For Moscow to truly negotiate, it must be confronted with a situation in which extending the conflict further will present an unacceptable threat to itself.

The idea that they're still gunning for effectively regime change is remarkable. \n\nThere's a short assessment of Western sanctions and the Ukrainian campaign on Russian oil infrastructure \n\n> Russia will be unable to fund the war indefinitely. Western sanctions are only one of the tools for damaging the regime\u2019s financial liquidity, and they are less effective than other options. Damage to Russia\u2019s oil infrastructure is likely to have a much greater impact. Although there are good reasons for the West to avoid directly aiding such attacks, that does not mean that Ukraine shouldn\u2019t undertake them.\n\nAn interesting perscription\n\n>So far, Western governments have not aggressively pursued information operations against the Russian government, partly because they are perceived as escalatory and partly because they are not expected to have immediate effect.

The AFP then interviewed three real people on that list and they were all alive and <a href=\"https://www.rfi.fr/fr/podcasts/les-dessous-de-l-infox-la-chronique/20240126-attaque-informationnelle-la-russie-imagine-la-mort-de-mercenaires-fran%C3%A7ais-en-ukraine\">two weren\u2019t even in Ukraine</a> anymore. Then their bloggers claimed another strike killed French MOD officials that were there to collect the bodies of those mercenaries. Even their <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/27119\"> state Duma</a> got involved in this insanity. As far as the Russians are concerned they have been spreading the propaganda that they are fighting actual NATO troops and generals the entire war. As for the French, they don\u2019t even have troops in Ukraine for the SCALP while the Brits do for the SS. Macron has done little for Ukraine compared to other countries in Europe so these claims of sending troops doesn\u2019t even make sense nor is his case for sending French soldiers going to come true anytime soon.</p>\n</div>",

As you said this is the strategy of sit behind the trenches and use strategic bombardment to catalyze such a crisis.  \n\nIf you define victory as simply forcing the Russians to sue for peace on more moderate terms such as freezing the conflict along the current front line. Then the theory of victory becomes far simpler and far less outlandish. As this simply requires the Russians (either the military, or political leadership) recognizing that outright victory is unlikely and that continuing the war is likely to have extremely high costs with no likely hood of success. In such a scenario what Ukraine needs is a series of defensive victories that inflict disproportionate casualties on the Russians. Most importantly they need an uninterrupted flow of foreign aid. If the Russians recognize that Ukrainian military capabilities are increasing while they are looking at potentially exhausting their supply of soviet era hardware, then they are likely to opt for a negotiated peace.",

As you said this is the strategy of sit behind the trenches and use strategic bombardment to catalyze such a crisis.  </p>\n\n<p>If you define victory as simply forcing the Russians to sue for peace on more moderate terms such as freezing the conflict along the current front line. Then the theory of victory becomes far simpler and far less outlandish. As this simply requires the Russians (either the military, or political leadership) recognizing that outright victory is unlikely and that continuing the war is likely to have extremely high costs with no likely hood of success. In such a scenario what Ukraine needs is a series of defensive victories that inflict disproportionate casualties on the Russians. Most importantly they need an uninterrupted flow of foreign aid. If the Russians recognize that Ukrainian military capabilities are increasing while they are looking at potentially exhausting their supply of soviet era hardware, then they are likely to opt for a negotiated peace.</p>\n</div>",

It's a dehumanizing characteristic to give the enemy, but ignores the anger hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians hold for Russians invading them and many died by. Off the bat, it makes you look silly.

Other clear examples of Ukrainian actions such as [assassinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darya_Dugina) and other [\"extracurricular\" activities](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/investigating-the-attack-on-nord-stream-all-the-clues-point-toward-kyiv-a-124838c7-992a-4d0e-9894-942d4a665778) that need to be awkwardly navigated by the west and don't explain the actions of a puppet. Simply dismissing Ukrainians own desire to fight off Russia is... a bad start.\n\n>And the theory of the west is to make them hold on until November, and when they collapse\n\nPredicting a **collapse** by November (6 months) is a pretty impressive claim, especially coming hot off a multi-billion dollar aid package passing Congress. This is the second issue with your post. Is there any analyst that agrees with this assessment? If you don't actually have any reference to back your words, this may be why people call you \"non-credible\" if you're just making up figures in your head based on the current vibes.",

Other clear examples of Ukrainian actions such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darya_Dugina\">assassinations</a> and other <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/investigating-the-attack-on-nord-stream-all-the-clues-point-toward-kyiv-a-124838c7-992a-4d0e-9894-942d4a665778\">&quot;extracurricular&quot; activities</a> that need to be awkwardly navigated by the west and don&#39;t explain the actions of a puppet. Simply dismissing Ukrainians own desire to fight off Russia is... a bad start.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the theory of the west is to make them hold on until November, and when they collapse</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Predicting a <strong>collapse</strong> by November (6 months) is a pretty impressive claim, especially coming hot off a multi-billion dollar aid package passing Congress. This is the second issue with your post. Is there any analyst that agrees with this assessment? If you don&#39;t actually have any reference to back your words, this may be why people call you &quot;non-credible&quot; if you&#39;re just making up figures in your head based on the current vibes.</p>\n</div>",

On top of that, they're having to invest in building new infrastructure to export LNG and/or build and expand existing pipelines to be able to sell to countries like China which as previously noted, gets a *huge* discount compared with what Gazprom was getting in the European market. China has also made clear that they don't want to become reliant on cheap Russian natural gas in the same way Europe did. \n\nYet another example of how, even if Putin does manage some kind of narrow military victory in Ukraine he can sell to the public, the actual longterm costs of this conflict to Russia will make that victory pyrrhic at best.",

            "body": "Arguably- part of the reason this war even started -back in 2014- was because of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.\n\nRussia has always been a geographically hamstrung land based Empire- forced to compete with seafaring Empires for the last ~500 years. The vast majority of Western European Empires succeeded in overseas colonization- whereas Russia failed spectacularly in overseas endeavors -or really anything requiring a naval / maritime supply line (Russian colonization attempts on the west coast of the N. America, the sale of Alaska, the loss of Port Arthur through an at the time unprecedented and embarrassing defeat by quite literally a brand new East Asian navy).\n\nI believe that Russian political theory therefore sees naval power and projection as an outright *must* in order to be considered a true global power. I believe this also stems from insecurity caused by centuries of Russia being a relative non-player in global affairs due to them lacking true maritime projection and overseas possessions- at least up until the last century when compared with Western European powers, and now East Asian powers.\n\nGeographically- Russia has always been limited by their (limited) access to the sea. The Baltics were always dominated by the Nordic states / Empires, and now the Baltic Sea is essentially a NATO lake that can be boxed off if it came down to it. Kaliningrad is now a fish in a barrel, St Petersburg now trapped in a fatal funnel. Murmansk is ice free year round- but again any naval vessels / maritime trade coming out of there are going to have to deal with the Nordic states / British Navy / NATO on the way out into the Atlantic.\n\nVladivostok freezes over occasionally, but that\u2019s a rarer problem when you consider that it is completely contained by Japan and South Korea (and the US bases stationed there). Even worse- were relations to sour between China and Russia- and China decided to right the wrongs of the \u201cunequal treaties\u201c- the Amur River annexation area of Russia is very geographically isolated from Russia proper. There is only one major highway linking the lower south-eastern Russian Pacific back to Siberia proper, and from there back to European Russia. And that highway is on average somewhere around 40 kilometers from the Chinese border for hundreds of miles.\n\nSakhalinsk is even more isolated- and completely inappropriate for a deep water port thanks to its terrain.\n\nSouthern Russia along the Black Sea coast *has* warm water ports- but they\u2019re tiny thanks to the terrain. Novorossiysk doesn\u2019t have the port space or facilities to be even be considered the main base of a large naval power.\n\nRostov-on-Don gets isolated 1/3 of the year thanks to the Don River freezing. And even then, before that it was geographically constrained not only behind the Sea of Azov, but then easily locked behind in the Black Sea behind the Bosporus Straits.\n\nThat leaves Sebastopol. Yup- locked behind the Bosporus too- but if the Russians plays their cards right they don\u2019t have to worry about the straits being *overtly* denied to them. Huge ports and facilities, war water year round, and a long history of seafaring. When Euromaidan happened back in 2014- Putin probably saw Russia\u2019s link to relevance in the outside world flash before his eyes. Russia really didn\u2019t have anywhere to put the Black Sea fleet in order to retain their relevance in the Middle East / Mediterranean if the Black Sea fleet had been ejected from Crimea after Euromaidan. That\u2019s why they acted so quickly to seize Crimea specifically- then the War in Donbas followed with less \u201centhusiasm\u201d. It\u2019s likely the same reason Mykolaiv and Odesa were such important targets back in February of 2022- on top of cutting Ukraine off from the sea.\n\nThe Russian Navy is supposed to be a symbol of Russian might and power projection on the world stage- see their \u201cdeployment\u201d of the Eye of Mordor aircraft carrier to Syria almost a decade ago. If Russia is going to take and hold Crimea for the long term- Ukraine may as well make one of the primary motivations for doing so mute by the piecemeal destruction of the Black Sea Fleet and its facilities- both as a symbolic measure, strategic purposes (cost-benefit of Russia continuing the war), and to boost morale. If Ukraine keeps striking and destroying Black Sea fleet assets in a never ending war- Russia may have no Black Sea \u201cfleet\u201d to speak of in a few years time.",

Murmansk is ice free year round- but again any naval vessels / maritime trade coming out of there are going to have to deal with the Nordic states / British Navy / NATO on the way out into the Atlantic.</p>\n\n<p>Vladivostok freezes over occasionally, but that\u2019s a rarer problem when you consider that it is completely contained by Japan and South Korea (and the US bases stationed there). Even worse- were relations to sour between China and Russia- and China decided to right the wrongs of the \u201cunequal treaties\u201c- the Amur River annexation area of Russia is very geographically isolated from Russia proper. There is only one major highway linking the lower south-eastern Russian Pacific back to Siberia proper, and from there back to European Russia. And that highway is on average somewhere around 40 kilometers from the Chinese border for hundreds of miles.</p>\n\n<p>Sakhalinsk is even more isolated- and completely inappropriate for a deep water port thanks to its terrain.</p>\n\n<p>Southern Russia along the Black Sea coast <em>has</em> warm water ports- but they\u2019re tiny thanks to the terrain. Novorossiysk doesn\u2019t have the port space or facilities to be even be considered the main base of a large naval power.</p>\n\n<p>Rostov-on-Don gets isolated 1/3 of the year thanks to the Don River freezing. And even then, before that it was geographically constrained not only behind the Sea of Azov, but then easily locked behind in the Black Sea behind the Bosporus Straits.</p>\n\n<p>That leaves Sebastopol. Yup- locked behind the Bosporus too- but if the Russians plays their cards right they don\u2019t have to worry about the straits being <em>overtly</em> denied to them. Huge ports and facilities, war water year round, and a long history of seafaring. When Euromaidan happened back in 2014- Putin probably saw Russia\u2019s link to relevance in the outside world flash before his eyes. Russia really didn\u2019t have anywhere to put the Black Sea fleet in order to retain their relevance in the Middle East / Mediterranean if the Black Sea fleet had been ejected from Crimea after Euromaidan. That\u2019s why they acted so quickly to seize Crimea specifically- then the War in Donbas followed with less \u201centhusiasm\u201d. It\u2019s likely the same reason Mykolaiv and Odesa were such important targets back in February of 2022- on top of cutting Ukraine off from the sea.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian Navy is supposed to be a symbol of Russian might and power projection on the world stage- see their \u201cdeployment\u201d of the Eye of Mordor aircraft carrier to Syria almost a decade ago. If Russia is going to take and hold Crimea for the long term- Ukraine may as well make one of the primary motivations for doing so mute by the piecemeal destruction of the Black Sea Fleet and its facilities- both as a symbolic measure, strategic purposes (cost-benefit of Russia continuing the war), and to boost morale. If Ukraine keeps striking and destroying Black Sea fleet assets in a never ending war- Russia may have no Black Sea \u201cfleet\u201d to speak of in a few years time.</p>\n</div>",
