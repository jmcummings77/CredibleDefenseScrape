I can't imagine it hurts to have hundreds more trucks, even pickup trucks available to follow up any sort of breakthrough. All over America there are millions of used vehicles which could be refurbished and sent over by ship for costs that in military terms would be considered trivial, without even talking about just sending over brand new vehicles.\n\nCould we be providing more engineering equipment like bridging stuff, construction vehicles, or backhoes for digging trenches? Is every Ukrainian soldier provided with the best clothing that they could? I think looking back on WW2, one of the big things that made the average US soldier so relatively effective and high morale wasn't even the higher standard of weaponry available to them, but the unheard of level of supply. Having regular access to good food, motorized transport, entertainment, etc. likely contributed substantially if indirectly to combat effectiveness by making soldiers feel supported and just making them healthier overall.\n\nSo what do you guys think are similar things that might help but don't get a lot of press, and would probably sidestep concerns over escalation?",

The best example would be the Wolfowitz doctrine, but that was more about preventing a regional hegemon and placating the GCC than establishing Cold War-esque compliant fascist regimes ala Pinochet. The fact that the post-invasion Iraqi government practically turned into an Iranian ally *under US military presence* demonstrates this.\n\nCalling \"Americanization\" a component of imperialism is a bit of a stretch IMO, assuming you're referring to American soft power.

Offensive neorealism has states seeking to establish **hegemony**. There is no \"enough hegemony\" within this framework.\n\nSecond of all, how would \"buffer states\" provide security in a post-Cold War environment? Buffer states are a Westphalian paradigm intended to put ground between an invading army and the home territory. At what point has there ever been a credible threat of NATO invasion of Russia since 1991? Hell, once the Cold War ended it was discovered that neither power had any intention of invading the other, despite both believing the opposite did. The US was just handed a **prime** opportunity two days ago to invoke Article 5.

The nature of corruption in Russia means that Russian financial elites use Russia's energy resources to extract bribes from their affiliates in neighboring countries, who themselves fatten their own wallets with domestic energy subsidies in a similar manner, Yanukovich being a prime example.

Mearsheimer's argument is that Russia didn't plan to annex parts of Ukraine, merely wanted to force Ukraine to surrender and agree to stay neutral or replace Zelensky with a pro-Russian president. However, as Russia has begun to lose, they've switched strategies to annex Ukraine to lockdown gains for potential negotiations later and for mobilization since Russia clearly can't replace Zelensky nor get concessions regarding neutrality.\n\nThis whole interview being weird stems from whether or not imperialism needs to be formal territory expansion, or whether or not destroying Ukrainian sovereignty by removing it's president and removing it's freedom to associate with the West to become a Russian puppet like Belarus is imperialism (and the answer is yes). Both the interviewer and Mearsheimer here are being obtuse and speaking past each other.",

        "body": ">[Ex-Russian spy flees to the NATO country that captured him, delivering another embarrassing blow to Moscow](https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-ex-russian-spy-flees-to-the-nato-country-that-captured-him-delivering-another-embarrassing-blow-to-moscow-010049616.html)\n\n>\u201cThe Russians have no idea,\u201d Alexander Toots, the head of Estonian counterintelligence, tells me, laughing.\n\n>\u201cThey have absolutely no idea he is here. You can be the one to tell them.\u201d\n\n>Toots was referring to the defection of a Russian spy to Estonia. But Artem Zinchenko isn\u2019t just any spy. He was the first agent of Russia\u2019s military intelligence arrested by Estonia, in 2017, then traded back to Moscow a year later for an Estonian citizen in Russian custody. Zinchenko has now sought asylum from the very NATO country that unmasked and imprisoned him for spying against it.\n\n>Zinchenko\u2019s defection has not been publicly disclosed by either side until now, in what must count as a humiliating blow not only to the Kremlin but also to his onetime masters in the GRU, as the former Soviet military intelligence service is still known.\n\n>In early October, the Estonian government granted Yahoo News unprecedented access to Zinchenko. Over the course of four hours he offered up his autobiography, reflective and remorseless, detailing his supporting role in the mostly unseen shadow play between Russian espionage and Western efforts to thwart it. Estonia, once occupied by the Soviets, is now at the forefront of countering Russian intelligence gathering and provocations on NATO soil.\n\n>As Zinchenko told it, his decision to defect was as much motivated by the Kremlin\u2019s brutality at home and abroad as it was by what he saw as Estonia\u2019s humanity toward him, an enemy agent. His cautionary tale is also an indictment of the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB case officer whose own spy apparatus has been weakened amid his Ukraine war, according to British intelligence.\n\n>Once a highly secretive and effective spy agency, the GRU in the past decade has come under heightened international scrutiny owing to a spate of compromised or failed operations. Foremost among these is the hacking and leaking of Democratic Party emails in advance of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the botched 2018 assassination attempt on Sergei Skripal, another defector from its ranks, in Salisbury, England. The GRU is now reportedly assuming a firmer grasp on Russia\u2019s faltering but gruesome campaign in Ukraine, where Zinchenko has relatives fighting on the frontlines on behalf of Kyiv against the very masters he once served.\n\n>The war, in fact, is the reason this GRU spy fled Russia.\n\n>I am sitting at a long wooden table at the heavily fortified HQ of the Kaitsepolitseiamet (KaPo), as Estonia\u2019s FBI is known. It is Oct. 3 and I\u2019ve only just arrived from New York in Tallinn, Estonia\u2019s capital, at the oblique request of Toots, who did not disclose the reason for my visit in advance owing to security concerns, claiming only that it would be worth my while.\n\n>\u201cWe have never had a case like this before,\u201d Toots says, by way of briefing me on Zinchenko. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has.\u201d\n\n>He is right about that. No one has ever had a case like this before, at least as far as is publicly known. The history of the Cold War and post-Cold War eras is rife with elaborate, almost implausible tales of defectors and double agents, sometimes even triple agents, spies who worked for one or more governments simultaneously for love or money or for the simple thrill of leading a hidden life. There are those with access to state secrets, some immeasurably valuable, who betrayed their country for ideological reasons or, as they often rationalize the treachery to themselves, perfectly pragmatic ones.\n\n>And now there is a historic first: the enemy spy who came back to the people who caught and released him.\n\n>\u201cA lot of officers of the Russian services are against the war,\u201d Toots says. \u201cThey consider it to be a crime against Russia and the Russian people. We will be more than pleased to interact with anyone else looking for a new place to live.\u201d\n\n>When did Zinchenko defect?\n\n>\u201cVery recently.\u201d The exact date is withheld from me. Toots prefers not to say if KaPo facilitated the flight of Zinchenko and his family to Estonia but invites me to ask him when he arrives, which will be any minute now.\n\n>My next two questions are more provocative.\n\n>Did KaPo recruit Zinchenko while he was in Estonian custody and play him back to Moscow under the pretense of a spy swap, in order to allow him to gather intelligence for Tallinn from inside Russia?\n\n\n>Toots won\u2019t answer that either. But in a way it is a moot point. Clearly he turned Zinchenko philosophically somehow in the year or so when he was his suspect and then prisoner. There is little other explanation for how the Russian felt comfortable reaching out to Toots, the man who arrested him, to ask if Toots might now become his protector.\n\n>Finally, how can we be sure that Zinchenko hasn\u2019t been sent here again by the GRU, perhaps in a psychological operation intended to muddy Western perceptions of Putin\u2019s weakness or internal dissent in Russia?\n\n>At this question, Toots laughs again and shrugs as if to say, \u201cAnything\u2019s possible in this line of work.\u201d Yet I am left with the strong impression that he\u2019s certain of Zinchenko\u2019s bona fides.\n\n\n>Talking to Toots is like this \u2014 by turns playful and frustrating.\n\n>At 52, he easily qualifies as Estonia\u2019s George Smiley, novelist John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s veteran British spy and spycatcher, whose professional climax is blackmailing his Soviet nemesis, \u201cKarla,\u201d into defecting. In his 15 years in the job, Toots\u2019s quarries have tended to be agents of Moscow; Zinchenko was the 10th he exposed in the space of nine years. Five GRU spies have been arrested since. There will be more; there will always be more.\n\n>Like Smiley, Toots snared a Russian spy who was a colleague and friend, an employee of KaPo who was secretly working for the Russians. Aleksei Dressen was arrested as he and his wife, Victoria, were about to board a plane from Tallinn airport to Moscow with a thumb drive full of classified intelligence.\n\n>Unlike Smiley, a portly homburg-and-specs relic of 1970s England, Toots could easily be mistaken for a suburban high school gym teacher. There\u2019s an onomatopoeic quality to his surname, which is pronounced touts. He has a close-cropped haircut, an athletic build (he runs several miles a day), and I\u2019ve never seen him in anything other than a polo shirt. He is unemotional and unaffected, almost to a fault, as though to behave otherwise in the role would be a dereliction of duty and an affront to the courtesy he extends to all members of his morally dubious profession, whatever side they\u2019re on.\n\n>Toots speaks Russian flawlessly and is given to quoting proverbs and folk expressions in the language. One favorite: \u201cChaos is a trait of Russian culture. There always needs to be a shepherd; otherwise it\u2019s anarchy.\u201d\n\n>Now he is Zinchenko\u2019s shepherd.\n\n>Toots shows me the February 2018 video of the handover on the Piusa River bridge at the Koidula border crossing, in southern Estonia, opposite the Russian city of Pskov. Zinchenko is being exchanged for Raivo Susi, an Estonian businessman convicted of espionage in Russia. The scene lacks the Hollywood drama one has come to expect from these occasions: the darkened no-man\u2019s-land where two returnees from opposing sides of the Iron Curtain walk past each other across Checkpoint Charlie.\n\n>In the video, Toots meets his Russian counterpart, a middle-aged officer from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB, at the snowbound crossing. They shake hands and exchange pleasantries before the mutual orders are given to their people. Susi is taken out of a Volkswagen minivan by FSB guardsmen in balaclavas. Toots personally escorts Zinchenko, wearing a parka and holding only a small blue briefcase, to the custody of the Russian government. There are hugs of homecoming and polite farewells.\n\n>Zinchenko is wispily thin, in a turtleneck and quite possibly in the same parka he wore when he crossed over into Pskov, with short, lank hair combed forward down his forehead. He could pass for a lab technician on his lunch break or a computer programmer who\u2019s been up all night coding, confined to some halogen-bathed subbasement in Eastern Europe. He appears older than his 35 years, even though his manner is that of a younger man, tentative and halting. He is visibly nervous as he and Toots speak amicably in Russian.\n\n>I shake hands with Zinchenko. He apologizes for his English, which is better than he lets on, even if I occasionally speak too quickly for his ear and have to repeat myself. The first thing he volunteers is why he is here.\n\n>\u201cThe awful situation that took place on the 24th of February,\u201d he says, referring to the start of Russia\u2019s unprovoked war against Ukraine. \u201cIt is the worst scenario that could even be imagined in my mind, and it was not only because my relatives live there, but because of the huge number of innocent victims.\u201d",

Toots prefers not to say if KaPo facilitated the flight of Zinchenko and his family to Estonia but invites me to ask him when he arrives, which will be any minute now.</p>\n\n<p>My next two questions are more provocative.</p>\n\n<p>Did KaPo recruit Zinchenko while he was in Estonian custody and play him back to Moscow under the pretense of a spy swap, in order to allow him to gather intelligence for Tallinn from inside Russia?</p>\n\n<p>Toots won\u2019t answer that either. But in a way it is a moot point. Clearly he turned Zinchenko philosophically somehow in the year or so when he was his suspect and then prisoner. There is little other explanation for how the Russian felt comfortable reaching out to Toots, the man who arrested him, to ask if Toots might now become his protector.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, how can we be sure that Zinchenko hasn\u2019t been sent here again by the GRU, perhaps in a psychological operation intended to muddy Western perceptions of Putin\u2019s weakness or internal dissent in Russia?</p>\n\n<p>At this question, Toots laughs again and shrugs as if to say, \u201cAnything\u2019s possible in this line of work.\u201d Yet I am left with the strong impression that he\u2019s certain of Zinchenko\u2019s bona fides.</p>\n\n<p>Talking to Toots is like this \u2014 by turns playful and frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>At 52, he easily qualifies as Estonia\u2019s George Smiley, novelist John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s veteran British spy and spycatcher, whose professional climax is blackmailing his Soviet nemesis, \u201cKarla,\u201d into defecting. In his 15 years in the job, Toots\u2019s quarries have tended to be agents of Moscow; Zinchenko was the 10th he exposed in the space of nine years. Five GRU spies have been arrested since. There will be more; there will always be more.</p>\n\n<p>Like Smiley, Toots snared a Russian spy who was a colleague and friend, an employee of KaPo who was secretly working for the Russians. Aleksei Dressen was arrested as he and his wife, Victoria, were about to board a plane from Tallinn airport to Moscow with a thumb drive full of classified intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Smiley, a portly homburg-and-specs relic of 1970s England, Toots could easily be mistaken for a suburban high school gym teacher. There\u2019s an onomatopoeic quality to his surname, which is pronounced touts. He has a close-cropped haircut, an athletic build (he runs several miles a day), and I\u2019ve never seen him in anything other than a polo shirt. He is unemotional and unaffected, almost to a fault, as though to behave otherwise in the role would be a dereliction of duty and an affront to the courtesy he extends to all members of his morally dubious profession, whatever side they\u2019re on.</p>\n\n<p>Toots speaks Russian flawlessly and is given to quoting proverbs and folk expressions in the language. One favorite: \u201cChaos is a trait of Russian culture. There always needs to be a shepherd; otherwise it\u2019s anarchy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Now he is Zinchenko\u2019s shepherd.</p>\n\n<p>Toots shows me the February 2018 video of the handover on the Piusa River bridge at the Koidula border crossing, in southern Estonia, opposite the Russian city of Pskov. Zinchenko is being exchanged for Raivo Susi, an Estonian businessman convicted of espionage in Russia. The scene lacks the Hollywood drama one has come to expect from these occasions: the darkened no-man\u2019s-land where two returnees from opposing sides of the Iron Curtain walk past each other across Checkpoint Charlie.</p>\n\n<p>In the video, Toots meets his Russian counterpart, a middle-aged officer from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB, at the snowbound crossing. They shake hands and exchange pleasantries before the mutual orders are given to their people. Susi is taken out of a Volkswagen minivan by FSB guardsmen in balaclavas. Toots personally escorts Zinchenko, wearing a parka and holding only a small blue briefcase, to the custody of the Russian government. There are hugs of homecoming and polite farewells.</p>\n\n<p>Zinchenko is wispily thin, in a turtleneck and quite possibly in the same parka he wore when he crossed over into Pskov, with short, lank hair combed forward down his forehead. He could pass for a lab technician on his lunch break or a computer programmer who\u2019s been up all night coding, confined to some halogen-bathed subbasement in Eastern Europe. He appears older than his 35 years, even though his manner is that of a younger man, tentative and halting. He is visibly nervous as he and Toots speak amicably in Russian.</p>\n\n<p>I shake hands with Zinchenko. He apologizes for his English, which is better than he lets on, even if I occasionally speak too quickly for his ear and have to repeat myself. The first thing he volunteers is why he is here.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe awful situation that took place on the 24th of February,\u201d he says, referring to the start of Russia\u2019s unprovoked war against Ukraine. \u201cIt is the worst scenario that could even be imagined in my mind, and it was not only because my relatives live there, but because of the huge number of innocent victims.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

They had just overrun an enemy defensive position and were giving a sitrep:\n\n\"We overran the enemy position and have taken 5 enemy prisoners\".\n\ngunshot sounds\n\n\"I correct, 4 prisoners\"\n\nmore gunshot sounds\n\n\"I correct, 3 prisoners\"\n\nmore gunshot sounds and the transmission ends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater that day we get an update on the situation.

            "body": "# Reassurance and Deterrence in Asia\n###### Oriana Skylar Mastro\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUS defense strategy has long been predicated on the view that military\nactivities, maneuvers, and deployments are credible conveyers of information to both adversaries and partners about US willingness to fight in specific circumstances. Brian Blankenship and Erik Lin-Greenberg\u2019s article,\n\u201cTrivial Tripwires? Military Capabilities and Alliance Reassurance,\u201d makes\nan important contribution by demonstrating that not all military activities\nare created equal when it comes to reassuring allies and partners.\nBlankenship and Lin-Greenberg rightfully capture reassurance as a product\nof resolve and capability\u2014thus a \u201creassuring\u201d state can provide differing\nacts of reassurance depending on the degree of resolve it wishes to demonstrate and the capabilities it possesses. The authors evaluate four types of\nreassurance, which vary according to their strength of signaling resolve and\ncapability: (1) tripwires; (2) fighting forces; (3) transient demonstrations;\nand (4) offshore presences. Relying largely on surveys of defense experts in\nthe Baltics and Central Europe, they argue that a commitment of fighting\nforces\u2014such as a permanent overseas base or a large in-country ground\ndeployment\u2014makes countries feel safest.\n\n\nThe big question that comes to mind is whether these findings are valid\nin other theaters, such as the Indo-Pacific. The rise of China presents the\ngreatest challenge to the security and interests of the United States and its\nallies since the Cold War. As China\u2019s military capabilities have grown, so\ntoo has its aggressiveness in pushing territorial issues in the South China\nSea, East China Sea, along the Sino-Indian border, and regarding Taiwan. \nIn response, the United States has undertaken numerous military efforts\ndesigned to enhance deterrence and reassure allies, including freedom-of-\nnavigation operations (FONOPS), a continuous presence of strategic bombers at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and an expanded Marine Air Ground Task Force deployed to Darwin, Australia. America\u2019s behavior\nreflects an ingrained conventional wisdom: increased military presence and\nactivities will signal US resolve, thereby will enhancing deterrence against\nan adversary and reassuring allies.\n\n\nWhether these policy decisions in Asia will indeed contribute to a peaceful and stable Asia directly concern the central claims made in Blankenship\nand Lin-Greenberg\u2019s study. Both their conceptualization of reassurance acts\nand their testing are derived from the European context. To be clear, the\nauthors note their typology is based on the European theater, but then\nthey do not couch their findings as being European-specific, instead mak-\ning general statements about the ineffectiveness of tripwires, for example.\n\n\nIn this response, I will argue that although their research is a step in the\nright direction, their conclusions do not tell us much about how the\nUnited States can reassure Asian allies and partners. Indeed, the article is\none more example of the broader problematic tendency to overly rely on\nEurope to build understanding in the security-studies field.\n\n\nI make three main points in this response. First, whether a force deployment serves as a tripwire depends on the risk to forces, not the number of\nforces deployed (as Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg argue). Second, how\ncapable a country\u2019s deployment is cannot be evaluated in isolation; the enemy\u2019s military capabilities greatly determine the relative capabilities of different posture decisions.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><h1>Reassurance and Deterrence in Asia</h1>\n\n<h6>Oriana Skylar Mastro</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>US defense strategy has long been predicated on the view that military\nactivities, maneuvers, and deployments are credible conveyers of information to both adversaries and partners about US willingness to fight in specific circumstances. Brian Blankenship and Erik Lin-Greenberg\u2019s article,\n\u201cTrivial Tripwires? Military Capabilities and Alliance Reassurance,\u201d makes\nan important contribution by demonstrating that not all military activities\nare created equal when it comes to reassuring allies and partners.\nBlankenship and Lin-Greenberg rightfully capture reassurance as a product\nof resolve and capability\u2014thus a \u201creassuring\u201d state can provide differing\nacts of reassurance depending on the degree of resolve it wishes to demonstrate and the capabilities it possesses. The authors evaluate four types of\nreassurance, which vary according to their strength of signaling resolve and\ncapability: (1) tripwires; (2) fighting forces; (3) transient demonstrations;\nand (4) offshore presences. Relying largely on surveys of defense experts in\nthe Baltics and Central Europe, they argue that a commitment of fighting\nforces\u2014such as a permanent overseas base or a large in-country ground\ndeployment\u2014makes countries feel safest.</p>\n\n<p>The big question that comes to mind is whether these findings are valid\nin other theaters, such as the Indo-Pacific. The rise of China presents the\ngreatest challenge to the security and interests of the United States and its\nallies since the Cold War. As China\u2019s military capabilities have grown, so\ntoo has its aggressiveness in pushing territorial issues in the South China\nSea, East China Sea, along the Sino-Indian border, and regarding Taiwan. \nIn response, the United States has undertaken numerous military efforts\ndesigned to enhance deterrence and reassure allies, including freedom-of-\nnavigation operations (FONOPS), a continuous presence of strategic bombers at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and an expanded Marine Air Ground Task Force deployed to Darwin, Australia. America\u2019s behavior\nreflects an ingrained conventional wisdom: increased military presence and\nactivities will signal US resolve, thereby will enhancing deterrence against\nan adversary and reassuring allies.</p>\n\n<p>Whether these policy decisions in Asia will indeed contribute to a peaceful and stable Asia directly concern the central claims made in Blankenship\nand Lin-Greenberg\u2019s study. Both their conceptualization of reassurance acts\nand their testing are derived from the European context. To be clear, the\nauthors note their typology is based on the European theater, but then\nthey do not couch their findings as being European-specific, instead mak-\ning general statements about the ineffectiveness of tripwires, for example.</p>\n\n<p>In this response, I will argue that although their research is a step in the\nright direction, their conclusions do not tell us much about how the\nUnited States can reassure Asian allies and partners. Indeed, the article is\none more example of the broader problematic tendency to overly rely on\nEurope to build understanding in the security-studies field.</p>\n\n<p>I make three main points in this response. First, whether a force deployment serves as a tripwire depends on the risk to forces, not the number of\nforces deployed (as Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg argue). Second, how\ncapable a country\u2019s deployment is cannot be evaluated in isolation; the enemy\u2019s military capabilities greatly determine the relative capabilities of different posture decisions. Third, Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg\u2019s assumption\nthat transient military operations are low risk (and thus signal lower resolve) is not valid in the Asian theater.</p>\n\n<h5>Tripwires: Defined by Automaticity, Not Numbers</h5>\n\n<p>Though I applaud Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg for deepening our\nunderstanding of reassurance, there are significant issues with their\ntypology\u2014in particular, with its measurement validity in the Asian context.\nThe first issue is that the definition and measurement of tripwires not only\nfail to cover many crucial cases but also prove especially problematic outside the land domain.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the two most emblematic examples of tripwires were US forces\nstationed in Germany and South Korea during the Cold War.

                "body": "##### Fighting Forces: Capability Is Contingent\n\nBlankenship and Lin-Greenberg reserve the term \u201cfighting forces\u201d for military deployments that constitute high capability but also communicate high\nresolve\u2014reassurances that fit the bill of meaningful changes to defensive\ncapability, as fighting forces are supposed to be able to sustain combat. But\nin Asia, the offshore forces fit this bill. In other words, which types of\nforces can \u201ceffectively punish the adversary or deny its ability to take territory\u201d is completely dependent on context, and thus it is foolhardy to create\na one-size-fits-all measurement. \n\nThough one can debate the article\u2019s measurement strategy, the general\npremise is theoretically and empirically sound: military choices that enhance\ncapabilities to defend have the greatest impact on both deterring the adversary\nand reassuring allies. In my work, I have argued that US statements and\nmaneuvers designed to enhance deterrence through communicating commitment without meaningful improvements to combat capability have a negligible impact on stability across the Taiwan Strait\u2014in the words of the\nauthors, \u201cHigh resolve cannot offset low capability.\u201d Indeed, Chinese strategists already assume US military intervention in their decision-making.\nFurthermore, given a shift in local balance of power, the possibility that the\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) could win even if the United States intervenes may embolden Chinese decision-makers. I have therefore advocated for\nadjusting US military posture not to send political signals but instead to demonstrate that the United States has the capability to defend Taiwan.\n\nBut does the authors\u2019 measurement of fighting forces\u2014which includes large,\nin-country ground deployments and permanent overseas bases\u2014best capture\nthose that \u201cinflict punishment on adversary targets or deny an adversary the\nability to take and hold territory\u201d? Not in the context of contingencies against\nChina, where in-theater operations (what the authors refer to as \u201ctransient demonstrations\u201d) and offshore presence create a greater ability to defeat China than\nthe authors\u2019 \u201cfighting forces\u201d of large in-country ground deployments.\n\nWhat the authors are evaluating in their high-resolve, high-capability category of \u201cfighting forces\u201d is in effect what the US military refers to more often\nas a \u201cforward presence,\u201d or the positioning of forces in the first island chain\n(a boundary of archipelagos that stretches from Japan to Taiwan, and down to\nthe northern Philippines and the Malay Peninsula). Because the authors measure fighting forces based on the size and permanence of the force, they miss\nthe fact that large, permanent military bases can have little warfighting value\nin practice. The PLA Strategic Rocket Force has the capability to overwhelm\nUS missile defenses, destroying infrastructure and hardware, killing US forces,\nand rendering any US airfields inoperable in a range of up to 3,000 kilometers\u2014all within a potential engagement\u2019s opening salvos.\n\nChina\u2019s ability to do this all is not dependent on the size of the in-country deployments, which serves as the main factor for the authors.\nIn other words, their measurement strategy puts the largest in-country\ndeployments under \u201cfighting forces,\u201d but in practice, US forward presence operates more like tripwire forces in the Asian context.\n\n##### Transient Demonstrations: Degree of Risk, Not Military Domain, Determines Resolve\n\nBlankenship and Lin-Greenberg posit that transient demonstrations of military power, such as port calls or aircraft flyovers, are signals of both low resolve and low capability. Given that Europe is mainly a ground theater,\nthis view may be warranted. But in Asia, where the main domains of competition are the sea and air, US willingness to conduct military maneuvers\nthere can be quite risky, and thus can signal high resolve. For example, one\ntype of \u201ctransient demonstration\u201d the United States conducts in the South\nChina Sea, FONOPS, carries substantial risk. Chinese military forces also\nincreasingly operate in these waters to establish de facto control there.\nBoth sides believe these FONOPS increase the likelihood of war, for two\nmain reasons: first, because they increase the likelihood of accidents and\nmisinterpretations, and second, because they heighten diplomatic tensions.\nSchelling\u2019s concept of risk manipulation is at play: like buzzing a plane (flying dangerously close), FONOPS are threats that \u201cleave something to\nchance\u201d to demonstrate resolve. There have been close calls, as China frequently sends ships to attempt to direct US ships off course. Simply put,\nthese air- and sea-based forces are more likely to encounter the Chinese\nmilitary than any in-country deployment.\n\nMoreover, an argument could also be made that those transient demonstrations of military power\u2014which the military refers to as flexible\ndeterrence options\u2014signal more capability than offshore presence\n(Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg argue the opposite). The Chinese military\u2019s main advantage is geographic in nature. Since the United States is\nattempting to project power across vast distances, China might be able\nto take Taiwan before the United States can even amass the necessary\nforces to respond. Part of US deterrence efforts in these transient\ndemonstrations is to show China that it can put together and deploy\nlarge force packages quickly from many different locations. Since allied\ncountries in Asia may not allow the United States to operate from their\nterritory during a conflict, the ability to rapidly deploy to conduct air\nand sea operations could be limited. For this reason, a dispersed temporary offshore presence can signal a greater defense capability than US\nforward presence in Japan or South Korea would.\n\n#####Concluding Thoughts\n\nI applaud the reassurance typology that finally considers capabilities. I have\nno doubt that the authors\u2019 finding that high resolve cannot offset low cap-\nability holds true universally. But the types of military activities that would\nfall into each of their categories\u2014what constitutes low/high resolve or low/\nhigh capability\u2014is theater-specific. Additionally, I would argue that degree\nof automaticity of response is the defining characteristic of tripwire forces,\nwhereas degree of risk is the primary factor in signaling resolve, not necessarily the forces\u2019 size and location.\n\nThese points hopefully serve to encourage the authors to pursue even\nfurther this important and impactful research agenda on alliance reassurance. I make two suggestions along those lines.\n\nFirst, I would be interested in seeing how the authors could better operationalize the typology in other domains. Currently, their conception of\nreassurance types is highly correlated by domain: fighting forces and tripwires\nare ground-based, offshore presence is naval, and transient demonstrations are\naerial. (Indeed, it is unclear why the deployment of US naval vessels is an off-\nshore presence, but bombers and fighters patrolling airspace are considered a\ntransient demonstration: they both present similar capabilities to hurt and do\nnot stay permanently.) It would be interesting to do a domain-neutral survey\nin which the authors could ask about the reassurance value of establishing a\nsingle squadron of fighters in-country (tripwire); a large air base in-country\n(fighting force); airbases and facilities throughout the second island chain (off-\nshore presence); or a rotational bomber/fighter presence based elsewhere but\npatrolling through the country\u2019s airspace (transient demonstrations).\n\nSecond, it is interesting to note that the vast majority (about seventy-six percent) of US military events in Asia fall into Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg\u2019s\nworst category\u2014transient demonstrations. These operations\u2014like FONOPS,\nroutine operations through the Taiwan Strait, and flyovers around the North\nKorean Peninsula\u2014supposedly demonstrate low resolve and low capability. It is\nan intriguing, and researchable, policy question about why the United States\nwould choose to focus so much of its efforts on precisely the types of activities\nthat Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg argue do little to reassure allies, and thus\ndo little to deter adversaries. After all, most of the activities that fall within the\nauthors\u2019 reassurance typology are not primarily meant to reassure at all, but to\ndeter. This inconsistency raises the additional question of whether the purpose of\nthe military activity determines whether it signals high resolve and/or capability.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/09636412.2022.2140598",
