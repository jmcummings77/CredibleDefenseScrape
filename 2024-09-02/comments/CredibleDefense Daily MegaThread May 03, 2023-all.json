      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

(Chips, space launch, rare earth mining, tech, etc.) This has to be done while simultaneously trying to tear down trade barriers for everything else to every allied or neutral country to economically integrate and gain influence over them. There is a reason why people use &quot;largest trading partner&quot; maps to illustrate the rise of China. Policies that are somewhat similar to what China is doing itself. Also, while the year-to-year GDP loss from broad protectionism will likely be marginal to an economy like the US, over several decades it may add up and (relatively) weaken the US.</p>\n</div>",

Corporations would much rather pay a working class guy a dollar a day in Malaysia than $25/hr here in the states. What happens when a bunch of non-college-educated men are unable to secure a lasting financial future for themselves and their family? That&#39;s a domestic security threat if I&#39;ve ever seen one; one that&#39;s already clearly showing up in internal American politics.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the loss of heavy industry in America has been disastrous for our ability to respond to something like the Ukraine war in a reasonable timeframe. That&#39;s in large part due to free trade policies that have shipped said industries overseas.</p>\n</div>",

The article implies to me far more that they were just listening to economists who were pretty consistently beating the \"government intervention in trade=bad\" drum, and it had the side effect of turning China into a giant that needs to be cut down a peg. The new industrial policy is heavily influenced by the work of Stephen S. Cohen and J. Bradford Delong who argue that laissez-faire industrial policy is actually a finance favored industrial policy rather than no industrial policy.\n\nComplete protectionism would be bad for national security, we're in agreement there, but I don't think it's lost on world leaders that the US Navy is the only reason global trade exists and works. We don't need to outsource 95% of heavy industry and just completely kneecap non finance, tech, or healthcare workers to get bases around the world or be geopolitically relevant. It's still in those countries best interests to keep the US happy. Especially at the current moment where everybody not in the EU or named China would be in a very, very, very bad place if the US started privileging domestic finance which is a nuclear option we always have with no other country eager to replace us in that role. Plus, it's not like this is an either or thing. We don't need to go full not invented here just to create more middle income jobs which is the real goal of not outsourcing everything.\n\nLike Noah implied, it's also a pretty straight line from laissez faire industrial policy to populist extremism which is a very real domestic security threat that is clearly a major problem in the entire western world at the moment.  Plus, while it's been a bit forgotten, the UK during covid vaccine rollout was kind of a shit show because they were making a bunch of vaccines for other people while they desperately needed vaccines themselves. That's kind of a canary in the coal mine for what a real crisis situation would look like under the old industrial policy, and if we're serious about a cold war with China, that's probably going to happen at some point.\n\nGranted, I'm definitely biased from my background as a physical chemist because this new industrial policy actively benefits me, but it really is a waste that your typical US physics PhD goes on to work on making ad delivery 0.1% more efficient instead of something that's actually uniquely in their training because the only other relevant good jobs in appreciable quantities are defense contracting (which a lot of people are morally against) and semiconductor process engineer (which is an awful job in every facet besides pay which isn't even all that for the kind of training they ask for).",

I think a large scale strategic bombing campaign like that would need to be planned in advance, and a fundamental shift in strategy wouldn't be embarked on on a whim.

Are they really anything to fear? Or are they in fact a desirable outcome from a Ukrainian military standpoint?\n\nTo put it simply, Russia has a certain limited amount of military means, cruise missiles, artillery etc. They also have a finite list of targets to service and a certain capacity to identify and track targets, coordinate strikes etc.\n\nTheoretically these means will be matched against the targets available in a more or less logical fashion to have as great a military impact as possible.\n\nHowever, if a new priority is introduced, i.e. a political dimension of demonstrating retaliation to the Russian public, then this will impact the theoretically ideal or logical assignment of means to ends.\n\nIf suddenly the new priority is making life miserable for Ukrainian civilians by destroying their heating in the middle of winter for example, instead of hitting genuine military targets, that is, from a military perspective, favourable to Ukraine.\n\nIt's also unlikely to materially impact Ukrainian will to fight, given that the Ukrainian public quite rightly seems to feel that they're engaged in an existential conflict for thier very national survival.\n\nSo while the humanitarian impact of Russian retaliatory strikes could be and has been tragic, and my mind is drawn to the terrible civilian deaths in Kherson recently, from a cold perspective of military calculation, it would seem that Ukrainian actions that are likely to cause Russia to feel the need to retaliate could be a militarily sound strategy, especially if the investment in them is low.\n\nFrom this perspective every performative Russian retaliatory strike, every cruise missile that takes out a pedestrian bridge in Kyiv or artillery bombardment against a supermarket that risks counter battery fire for no military value, moves the balance of forces incrementally towards Ukraine.\n\nThis all while having next to no likelihood of breaking Ukrainian will, and likely drawing outrage in the West that could encourage further support.",

Right now, Ukraine is running probing attacks and reconaissance is many different areas of the front line.
