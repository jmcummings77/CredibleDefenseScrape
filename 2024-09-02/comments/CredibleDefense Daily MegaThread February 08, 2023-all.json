It has produced reports on the Syrian War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War, &quot;focusing on military operations, enemy threats, and political trends in diverse conflict zones&quot;.[1][2] <strong>The institute currently publishes daily reports on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine</strong>[3] as well as the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran.[4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They&#39;re producing daily reports meant to be used as sources, which is they also provide sources.

                                    "body": "Part II\n\nThere are a couple reasons I think the UAF tapped into their strategic reserve recently. But before I get into that, let's go back a second to try to better understand how we got to this point by discussing what was the strategic priority in the past and why they usually got the reserves.   \nLate summer: Liberating the Kherson bridgehead was the strategic main effort, they got priority access to units, ammo, etc. OC-E and the ad hoc tactical-operational level commands inside Kharkiv and the Donbas weren't starved though, they still had access to a large number of units (they'd gotten reinforced in mid summer right after Luhansk fell). But they weren't as strong as OC-S (the regional command running the Kherson op). The biggest indicator is the Kharkiv Counteroffensive assault force, five brigades that were all in the Kharkiv or Donbas area of operations for at least a month beforehand, some for 3-4 months, and in August Jomini of the West didn't rate any of them better than 55-74% readiness, whereas two of them were 40-55%, which is barely combat effective (he rated them all as 55-74% readiness during the offensive, so they were likely plussed up right before the offensive). \n\nFall: Kherson turned into a slow grind but there are indicators since mid Oct that the Russians are actively retreating. The entire operation ends by Nov 12, with the retreat finished on the same day it was announced (which means it had been happened for weeks, as so many had been saying). However, great things happened after the Kharkiv counteroffensive, especially into Luhansk, so the strategic main effort is switched from OC-S to OC-E, specifically Luhansk. \n\nNot only did their offensive manage to take Kupiansk and Izyum and severe that entire Izyum operational axis, they were also able to cross the Oskil River and keep heading east. Additionally, east of Sloviasnk, NW of Siversk, they crossed the Donets uncontested from the south when the Russians were so weak and strung out that they didn't even defend the north bank of the Donets in Ozerne, which was how the Lyman campaign succeeded, the Russian position was enveloped from over 180 degrees.   \nThen the UAF cooked up a hasty offensive against Svatove and Kreminna separately. I believe the Svatove thrust is to try to reach Starobilsk, to cut the Russian supply line heading to the Donetsk from Belgorod, while the assault through Kreminna is intended to to Severondonetsk and outflank it from the north, so they don't need to retake it down the road from a western facing contested river assault. \n\nMeanwhile, Bakhmut. It didn't make much sense for the Russians to keep attacking there and many people spent a lot of words then and now trying to find reasons they thought the Russians were bothering. Its still up in the air, we don't know. But attack they did, even when suffering elsewhere they still kept constant offensive pressure on Bakhmut. But not enough to warrant much observation, there was still hope through October and November (even as late as December) that the Ukrainians might achieve a success punching through the Svatove-Kreminna line, that location was the operational schwerpunkt, Bakhmut was less important. Nonetheless, it was still bad enough that they needed to reinforce it with units like the 93rd Mechanized, which I remember mentally thinking was important because that was a pretty good offensive unit, who was one of the assault brigades used in the Kharkiv Counteroffensive, who had been in the Donbas since July minimum often on the attack west of Izyum. But they weren't in the strategic reserve, that unit was already in the OC-E order of battle, so it was just an operational level transfer, Bakhmut needed them more than Kreminna (also, they probably were suffering from poor vehicle readiness after months of offensive ops, making them more suitable for manning fixed defenses in positional war.  \n\nWinter: Between fall mud and nasty winter conditions, the likelihood of a penetration of the Svatove-Kreminna Line seems low. Bakhmut is going poorly, the Russians are only making unimportant gains in terrain at that point, but casualties are stacking up and the Russians are taking some pretty big chances. With the Kherson offensive over, with the Svatove Kreminna offensive fizzling out, with the rest of the theater wide front being pretty quiet, Bakhmut becomes center stage. Suddenly it becomes the strategic main effort, solely because its the political main effort in terms of Zelensky, Reznikov, Zaluzhnyi, and everyone else in terms of having to give daily pressers and talk about it (which they do way too much, in my opinion, especially Zelensky). And that unlocks units. \n\nContinued in Part III",

But before I get into that, let&#39;s go back a second to try to better understand how we got to this point by discussing what was the strategic priority in the past and why they usually got the reserves.<br/>\nLate summer: Liberating the Kherson bridgehead was the strategic main effort, they got priority access to units, ammo, etc. OC-E and the ad hoc tactical-operational level commands inside Kharkiv and the Donbas weren&#39;t starved though, they still had access to a large number of units (they&#39;d gotten reinforced in mid summer right after Luhansk fell). But they weren&#39;t as strong as OC-S (the regional command running the Kherson op). The biggest indicator is the Kharkiv Counteroffensive assault force, five brigades that were all in the Kharkiv or Donbas area of operations for at least a month beforehand, some for 3-4 months, and in August Jomini of the West didn&#39;t rate any of them better than 55-74% readiness, whereas two of them were 40-55%, which is barely combat effective (he rated them all as 55-74% readiness during the offensive, so they were likely plussed up right before the offensive). </p>\n\n<p>Fall: Kherson turned into a slow grind but there are indicators since mid Oct that the Russians are actively retreating. The entire operation ends by Nov 12, with the retreat finished on the same day it was announced (which means it had been happened for weeks, as so many had been saying). However, great things happened after the Kharkiv counteroffensive, especially into Luhansk, so the strategic main effort is switched from OC-S to OC-E, specifically Luhansk. </p>\n\n<p>Not only did their offensive manage to take Kupiansk and Izyum and severe that entire Izyum operational axis, they were also able to cross the Oskil River and keep heading east. Additionally, east of Sloviasnk, NW of Siversk, they crossed the Donets uncontested from the south when the Russians were so weak and strung out that they didn&#39;t even defend the north bank of the Donets in Ozerne, which was how the Lyman campaign succeeded, the Russian position was enveloped from over 180 degrees.<br/>\nThen the UAF cooked up a hasty offensive against Svatove and Kreminna separately. I believe the Svatove thrust is to try to reach Starobilsk, to cut the Russian supply line heading to the Donetsk from Belgorod, while the assault through Kreminna is intended to to Severondonetsk and outflank it from the north, so they don&#39;t need to retake it down the road from a western facing contested river assault. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Bakhmut. It didn&#39;t make much sense for the Russians to keep attacking there and many people spent a lot of words then and now trying to find reasons they thought the Russians were bothering. Its still up in the air, we don&#39;t know. But attack they did, even when suffering elsewhere they still kept constant offensive pressure on Bakhmut. But not enough to warrant much observation, there was still hope through October and November (even as late as December) that the Ukrainians might achieve a success punching through the Svatove-Kreminna line, that location was the operational schwerpunkt, Bakhmut was less important. Nonetheless, it was still bad enough that they needed to reinforce it with units like the 93rd Mechanized, which I remember mentally thinking was important because that was a pretty good offensive unit, who was one of the assault brigades used in the Kharkiv Counteroffensive, who had been in the Donbas since July minimum often on the attack west of Izyum. But they weren&#39;t in the strategic reserve, that unit was already in the OC-E order of battle, so it was just an operational level transfer, Bakhmut needed them more than Kreminna (also, they probably were suffering from poor vehicle readiness after months of offensive ops, making them more suitable for manning fixed defenses in positional war.  </p>\n\n<p>Winter: Between fall mud and nasty winter conditions, the likelihood of a penetration of the Svatove-Kreminna Line seems low. Bakhmut is going poorly, the Russians are only making unimportant gains in terrain at that point, but casualties are stacking up and the Russians are taking some pretty big chances. With the Kherson offensive over, with the Svatove Kreminna offensive fizzling out, with the rest of the theater wide front being pretty quiet, Bakhmut becomes center stage. Suddenly it becomes the strategic main effort, solely because its the political main effort in terms of Zelensky, Reznikov, Zaluzhnyi, and everyone else in terms of having to give daily pressers and talk about it (which they do way too much, in my opinion, especially Zelensky). And that unlocks units. </p>\n\n<p>Continued in Part III</p>\n</div>",

Besides Svatove-Kreminna, and with Kherson thankfully wrapping up before the 2023 dour predictions Ukraine was making about how long it could possibly last, the Ukraine strategic reserve is quite large. Not only are the all the units that were either built from scratch or rebuild following previous maulings that had missed the Kherson offensive but there were those as well, as only a small portion of the overall brigades involved in that operation remained with OC-E to sit opposite of the Dnieper, a much shorter frontage that (like the Russian side) can be manned in minimal numbers. \n\nWith the freed up units from Kherson, my guess is upwards of 3/4 of those maneuver units being used during the close of the Kherson offensive either entered the strategic rear (mainly to get rebuilt after losses from Kherson and/or get trained on new equipment), or immediately got transferred to other operational fronts, namely the Donbas.  So that is how units like the 24th were in Bakhmut, despite only months earlier having liberated Kherson city in mid November.    \nSo mid to late December, those existing units in Bakhmut from summer and even the reinforcements from early to mid fall need help, and some are being rotated out too. Units like the 93rd are rotated out with brigades new to the OC-E region been added to the Bakhmut AO. THAT was part of its strategic reserve, so they did commit it once. \n\nThe question then becomes, when did the Ukrainians seriously start putting aside units that they weren't planning on using immediately for some future offensive? I don't think they did that until very recently. \n\nOne, Ukraine has never really built up a sizeable strategic rear, they seem to rely on units being rebuilt plus new units all being roughly ready at a similar time. That's why they rush individual basic training and that which is for new Western equipment, by shortening the time it means the less time units need to reconstitute, which means they go right back into the fight ASAP where needed. A spring summer offensive is still months off now, but back even in December it was half a year away. To them, it wouldn't make sense to have quality units sitting on their asses twiddling their thumbs and wasting time training (the UAF literally still cling to the belief that training beyond a minimal is wasteful, despite saying otherwise their actions speak for themselves). They seem to prove their Red Army cultural history making decisions like this too, its a shared mindset that is no surprise considering Ukraine is a successor state to the USSR, and that all senior general officers were already colonels by the time the UAF remotely started looking for direction to the West. \n\nTwo, There was still an unknown about Russian offensive potential. All through the fall even, nonstop talk about Belarus invasion. Then all through winter, nobody would shut up about if and when the Russian winter offensive will occur. Then that shifted to threat of spring offensive trying to jump off before the Ukrainians, with a shockingly high number not realizing spring doesn't start until April not late February. And then after the uptick in Russian offensives especially in Donbas since last week, many are suggesting  the offensive already started. The point being is at least a significant part of its actual strategic reserve, especially units close to or expected to become combat ready in a short time period (constant revolving door), are needed for that threat. \n\nSo who is in the Ukrainian strategic rear right now? Probably new units, including all those reflagged and enlarged National Guard brigades they formed. Units sent to start training on Western kit. Exhausted units getting R&R while reconstituting with new \"recruits\" that came from various training pipelines. \n\nOf that, how much of it does nothing until the spring summer?  Probably just the units getting western equipment training, though it wouldn't surprise me if they get committed early in small numbers to \"test\" them in other places. \n\nThis whole issue with the UAF GenStab's inability to create a proper offensive reserve is what the US Joint Chiefs have been ranting about for half a year. A sizeable force put aside solely for breakthrough operations as part of the strategic main effort campaign, then back to reconstitution and preparing for the next one, never being committed unless only for that narrow role, at least corps sized. \n\nAnd the UAF say they want that, they say they want and they especially want it all to have western equipment, especially AFV. But they say they don't have enough brigades as it is to do that. And that's true, but its a self inflicted wound, because they're trying to do too much with too less and they have been since the war started. It seems that is due to political restraints placed on them, but the reason doesn't really matter, the problem is the problem. They have to do better at prioritizing and economy of force. \n\nLastly, future offensive potential doesn't just mean what is in their strategic reserve and I cannot stress this enough, because when they go on the offensive those wont be the only units involved, most of their front line forces will also be on the attack. And those need to be preserved too. Most of all that means having plenty of knowledgeable and experienced veterans, either through superior training or direct OJT in combat. Those need to be their junior enlisted and their junior officers especially, who they rely on ultra heavy because they didn't even have a real NCO corps before this war started and its only gotten worse since. They especially need highly competent company commanders, who know how to perform their role in a combined arms attack in particular. And they need highly competent battalion commanders, with sufficient staff officers too, in order to plan and execute those combined arms attacks. Which means they cannot waste these forces because THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PIPELINE TO REPLACE THEM. \n\nWestern tanks wont fix this. ATACMS wont fix this. If they lose too many of those company and field grade officers in particular through attritional fighting they are going to get stuck with a force that will have difficult planning how to pour piss out of a boot.",

When China began opening up to foreign investment, it did so in stages. This was an extremely risky move for China - the danger was that foreign companies would come in and immediately displace pretty much all Chinese domestic companies. That's why China opened up sectors of the economy one by one, and why it put joint-venture requirements in place. As time has passed, China has progressively removed restrictions on foreign investment.\n\nAt the same time, the opening up of the Chinese economy to foreign investment was a huge opportunity for foreign companies. If you go to China, you will see that many sectors of the economy are dominated by foreign companies. Volkswagen and GM cars are everywhere. There are thousands of Starbucks and KFCs. Apple is the largest smartphone brand. Joint-venture requirements did not prevent foreign companies from making an absolute killing in China.

When China began opening up to foreign investment, it did so in stages. This was an extremely risky move for China - the danger was that foreign companies would come in and immediately displace pretty much all Chinese domestic companies. That&#39;s why China opened up sectors of the economy one by one, and why it put joint-venture requirements in place. As time has passed, China has progressively removed restrictions on foreign investment.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the opening up of the Chinese economy to foreign investment was a huge opportunity for foreign companies. If you go to China, you will see that many sectors of the economy are dominated by foreign companies. Volkswagen and GM cars are everywhere. There are thousands of Starbucks and KFCs. Apple is the largest smartphone brand. Joint-venture requirements did not prevent foreign companies from making an absolute killing in China. Now, those requirements don&#39;t even exist any more in most parts of the economy.

If you read the full decision, you will find the court explicitly considered Russia to have substantial control over Girkin's unit, and hence considered the case to have happened in the context of an international conflict.\n\nAnd regardless, even in the conventions where they are mentioned (none of which were applied here), non-state actors must still have internal disciplinary systems observing the relevant convention to qualify for immunity (which were not at issue here).

Girkin was their literal commanding officer, and the proxies were de facto under direct Russian control (and even got direct fire and ground support in a number of instances). At minimum, can you tell me who should pay for reparations for the victims' families, if not Girkin or Russia?\n\nOn balance, I would posit it is you here who doesn't want to see anyone held responsible and therefore makes bold claims about a panel\nof Dutch judges being wrong about Dutch and international law.",

A reconstruction Olaf Scholz, as we know by now, is a man of spare emotions. When he is angry, he does not roar. And when he wins, he does not triumph. At least not loudly, with a victor's smile. When the Chancellor is really pleased with himself, he sounds like this:\n\n\"It is right that we have worked our way forward bit by bit.\"\n\n\"It is right that we have not allowed ourselves to drift.\"\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, that is the right principle.\"\n\nIt is Wednesday, a fortnight ago, when Olaf Scholz says these sentences in the plenary hall of the German Bundestag. A few hours earlier it had become known that the US government was prepared to send battle tanks to Ukraine. Shortly afterwards, the German government declared that it would also supply tanks. Scholz got the Americans to do it, Joe Biden praises him for his \"leadership\", and the man who just a moment ago was considered a ditherer suddenly looks like a determined leader. Now, in the plenary chamber of the Bundestag, even Scholz's harshest critic Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann (FDP) speaks mildly of \"good news for the people in Ukraine\". Even CDU MPs have no choice but to praise a \"right decision\". Sometimes, very sparingly, a smirk flits across the chancellor's face as he listens. As he explains his decision, Scholz says a sentence that, after 15 months of governing, can be seen as a promise of his chancellorship: \"Trust me.\"\n\nTrust is a precious resource. A government that sends tanks into a war needs the trust of the people. But it also needs the trust of the cabinet members among themselves, the unspoken certainty that one can rely on the other. That despite all differences of opinion, despite all personal differences, there is a line to which everyone sticks.\n\n\"Trust me\" - to whom is the chancellor speaking at this moment? To the Germans? To Germany's international partners, especially the Americans? Or to his ministers?\n\nIf you reconstruct the months leading up to the Chancellor's tank decision, if you talk to those involved in Berlin and Washington, you learn a lot about the state of trust - within the Western alliance, but also within the government. You learn about a chancellor who hardly talks to his foreign minister on a highly important question of international policy. We learn of a foreign minister who seeks her own ways to achieve her goals, pushing the limits of loyalty. One learns of discord and a trial of strength that has put not only the German government but also the relationship with the Americans under enormous tension. And perhaps will continue to do so.\n\nAfter the turnaround that Scholz announced almost a year ago in reaction to the start of the war, the tank turnaround is probably his most momentous decision. It also weighs so heavily because it divides the German population into two almost equally large camps of supporters and opponents. It touches on the question of trust. Olaf Scholz has known since the summer of last year that it would come up one day.\n\nIt's not as if Joe Biden and Olaf Scholz didn't see that Ukraine would need battle tanks at some point. The army's positions could hardly be held otherwise. Not to mention retaking cities like Mariupol. On the other hand, the two heads of government share a certain scepticism about Volodymyr Selenskyj. Who knows what the Ukrainian president would use heavy tanks for? This question arises; the scenarios range all the way to attacks on Russian territory. Neither Biden nor Scholz want that.\n\nOver Whitsun, word leaked out that the Spanish Ministry of Defence was considering sending 40 of Spain's Leopard tanks to Ukraine - tanks made in Germany. According to several sources, the Chancellor's Office and the Spanish authorities had an exchange of views on the matter. The signal from Berlin: the government in Madrid should not get the idea of applying for an export licence, as is necessary for the export of weapons produced in Germany. Berlin would not approve such an application.\n\nBy then, at the latest, it must have been clear to everyone in the German government how the Chancellor sees the Leopard issue. Joe Biden is no fan\n\nIn the summer, Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden's National Security Advisor, and his German counterpart, Jens Pl\u00f6tner, agreed to a fundamental exchange on the future of Ukraine. They want to end the endless loop of bloody front reports and new demands for weapons. The two advisors discuss what a modern Ukrainian army would have to look like that is capable of defending the country in the long term. It's about artillery systems like the self-propelled howitzer 2000 - but even then it's about main battle tanks.\n\nSullivan's people have counted the Leopards and come up with more than 2000 battle tanks made in Germany stationed in Europe. But these are scattered in various countries, the production capacities for replenishment are small, maintenance work would be necessary. The question arises as to what to do with the American M1 Abrams main battle tanks.\n\nThere it is, the idea of supplying the Abrams to Ukraine in addition to the Leopard.\n\nJoe Biden is not a fan of the idea. On the one hand, because of the distrust of Selenskyj. For another, for pragmatic reasons: The Abrams, unlike other main battle tanks, is normally not powered by diesel but by paraffin. So it needs its own supply infrastructure. And it needs an unusually large number of mechanics and engineers. A Pentagon rule of thumb says that four additional soldiers must be available for maintenance per tank and its five-man crew.\n\nWithin the US administration, the mood regarding battle tanks at this time looks like this: Biden - against. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin - against. Secretary of State Antony Blinken - tends to be open-minded. But the three agree that they consider the American Abrams tanks unsuitable. If heavy tanks are to be delivered, then the Europeans should go for it with their Leopards.\n\nAnnalena Baerbock knows this too. And she herself sees it the same way: the German Foreign Minister is convinced that urgent action must be taken. Any hesitation on the part of the German government, says the Foreign Office, will cost lives in Ukraine. The only question is: how do you get the necessary support?\n\nBaerbock has a good relationship with Antony Blinken, her US counterpart. She calls him a friend, and he publicly praises her leadership. In the summer, the two talk to each other about more weapons for Ukraine. According to information from several sources in the ZEIT, Baerbock aggressively promotes the idea of significantly expanding the armament of Ukraine in the conversation. She is convinced that Western battle tanks in particular are necessary. In the State Department it is clear what is meant by this: the Leopard.\n\nBlinken's people are surprised by the German foreign minister's brash behaviour: is Baerbock trying to play rough and get the Americans to discreetly push the chancellor in her, Baerbock's, direction? The USA is happy when European states want to get more involved. In these late summer and autumn days in Washington, one often hears that everything helps, no matter whether it's howitzers, anti-aircraft missiles or battle tanks; when it comes to weapons, one is \"agnostic\", one has no faith in the question. But the Americans are cautious when it comes to putting public pressure on the Chancellor.\n\nIs the advance on Blinken still the clever tactics of a minister? Or already diplomacy behind the back of the boss?\n\nAfter Baerbock and Blinken's conversation, the US ambassador to Germany, Amy Gutmann, gives an interview to ZDF. She explains that Germany must take an \"even greater leadership role\" in supporting Ukraine. Contrary to the Chancellor's credo, repeated dozens of times, to decide \"only in close coordination with partners\", Gutmann explains: \"The decision on the type of aid is ultimately up to each country itself.\"\n\nThe interview is produced in close coordination with Blinken's people in Washington; the ambassador has carefully rehearsed what she wants to say beforehand. The trick is to take Baerbock's impulse and play it back to Berlin without provoking a diplomatic affront. The interview is less than Baerbock had probably hoped for, but more than the US administration had previously let on.",

                "body": "The big decisions are made in the Chancellery\n\nThree days later, Baerbock also speaks, seizing the moment. In the FAZ, the Foreign Minister calls on her own government not to delay the decision on battle tanks - \"our weapons help save human lives\".\n\nIn mid-September, a meeting takes place between the Chancellor and the Foreign Minister. It is rumoured to be one of the last open, detailed ones for a very long time. Scholz is said to have asked Baerbock to keep a low profile. He would make a decision in due course. Cross shots are not helpful. Neither the Chancellery nor the Foreign Office would comment on the conversation when asked.\n\nAfter this unequivocal address, Baerbock does something that is not really in her nature: she remains silent. She respects cabinet discipline. Up to this point, she has done a lot to ensure that Germany finally delivers Leopard tanks. Perhaps even too much.\n\nForeign ministers are almost always popular, but they are rarely powerful. They can talk, mediate, advertise. But the big decisions are made in the Chancellor's Office. That's how it was under Angela Merkel, and that's how it is under Olaf Scholz. Annalena Baerbock will experience this in the summer and autumn months of 2022.\n\nBecause in the weeks that follow: nothing happens.\n\nScholz does not allow himself to be driven on the tank issue. On the contrary, the stronger the public pressure, the more stubborn the chancellor seems. Sometimes he seems almost defiant: when everyone wants him to declare his support for Nord Stream 2, he doesn't even utter the word. That's how it was a year ago, shortly before the outbreak of war. And it is similar now with the tank issue. He and his confidants always repeat their internal concerns: What if Ukraine attacks Russian territory with German tanks? What if Putin uses the delivery of battle tanks as a pretext for escalation? What about the unity of the West?\n\nThe Foreign Office, on the other hand, emphasises that Putin is waging a war against the entire European peace order. In such a situation, one should \"not do things by halves\". Moreover, the Foreign Office keeps receiving complaints from other countries about Scholz's dithering. Again and again, Baerbock has to justify her government's hesitancy in the Nato Foreign Ministers Council. Again and again, her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba presses for the delivery of battle tanks. This does not leave the Foreign Minister cold, on the contrary.\n\nBaerbock and Scholz - these are two types of politicians who hardly go together. Part of Baerbock's understanding of politics is to be touched. When she travels to Ukraine, she visits the destroyed cities. She wants to see the suffering left behind by the war. Afterwards, she often talks about what such an attack means for the children, how much her \"heart bleeds\". Sometimes she struggles with tears.\n\nPart of Olaf Scholz's self-image is outward unaffectedness. He is convinced that decisions require a certain coldness. That one must not allow oneself to be seized and that one can only recognise risks if one blocks out one's own feelings.\n\nShe speaks of values, he of interests. She wants a new self-confidence for German foreign policy. He thinks it's big talk.\n\nShe drives him crazy. And he drives her crazy too.\n\nIn November, the relationship between the two reaches a new low. Scholz plans a trip to China, Baerbock thinks the visit is a mistake. Shortly before his departure, she publicly declares that she expects the chancellor to stick to the coalition agreement, which talks about the \"systemic rivalry\" between China and the Federal Republic. She calls on Scholz to also address issues such as fair competition, human rights and recognition of international law during the visit. A foreign minister who publicly gives her boss rules of conduct for the trip - in the Chancellery, but also in other ministries, this is seen as presumptuous.\n\nIn the midst of the biggest foreign policy crisis of the post-war period, there is an exchange between the chancellor and the foreign minister that insiders perceive as \"zero communication\". With every step Baerbock dares to take, she seems to isolate herself further. There has also been no movement on the tank issue for weeks.\n\nA risky advance\n\nAt the turn of the year, the situation changes. Russian troops advance at Bachmut, Putin announces a new wave of mobilisation, the intelligence services fear a breakthrough on the Ukrainian eastern front.\n\nOn 5 January, Baerbock flies to London. The meeting is announced as a \"strategic dialogue\" between the Federal Republic and the United Kingdom. However, it seems that Baerbock is pursuing her very own strategy. According to ZEIT information, in a conversation with the British Foreign Minister James Cleverly, she advocates that the UK should be able to deliver Challenger tanks to Ukraine, and that it would then be seen how the German government behaved. She is obviously hoping for a domino effect. A risky move, especially in view of this history: the German Foreign Minister is lobbying an ally for tank deliveries - and leaves the impression that she wants to put the Chancellor under pressure once again.\n\nFor Scholz has still not changed his view. On the same day that Baerbock is in London talking about British battle tanks and the possible influence on the German decision, the Chancellor is on the phone with Biden, and this conversation is also about tanks - just not battle tanks. The Chancellery later announces that Biden and Scholz have expressed their joint determination to support Ukraine for as long as necessary. \"To this end, the United States intends to provide Ukraine with Bradley-type infantry fighting vehicles and Germany intends to supply Marder-type infantry fighting vehicles\" - about the Leopard: not a word. While the German Foreign Minister is promoting battle tanks in London, the Chancellor is silent on the subject. The dissonance between the two could hardly be greater.\n\nFour days after Baerbock's visit, on 9 January, Britain announces its intention to ship Challenger tanks to Ukraine. Two days later, Poland's President Andrzej Duda holds out the prospect of supplying Leopard tanks from Polish stocks, the export of which would have to be approved by the German government. Within a few days, the pressure on Olaf Scholz has grown enormously.\n\nThe repercussions of the London visit do not reach the Chancellor's Office via Baerbock, but by another route: the British get in touch. They say they made the decision in part to get the Germans to export Leopard tanks. Will anything move now? Scholz's people can't believe their ears.\n\nThere is a momentum now, the whole world is talking about battle tanks from Germany, even Scholz will have to budge at some point. But on what terms?\n\nOn 17 January, a Tuesday, at 4.15 p.m. German time, Scholz and Biden have another appointment to talk on the phone. At Biden's side are his National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Blinken. Scholz is surrounded by his closest confidants, including his foreign policy advisor Jens Pl\u00f6tner and Chancellery Chief Wolfgang Schmidt.\n\nThis time it is mainly about the battle tanks. The conversation is shrouded in confidentiality; neither the Chancellery nor the White House want to comment on the content. But some details have leaked out in the Washington Post. Scholz had again pointed out that the green light for the Leopards would only be given if the Americans for their part delivered M1 Abrams battle tanks. One must proceed \"in lockstep\", he said. \"I'll be in touch,\" Biden ends the conversation.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Biden, Blinken and Sullivan sat down together after the phone call and assessed the conversation: it had been \"disappointing\".\n\nThis is also true because the Americans understood Scholz to say that without the US tanks he would not only not want to supply German Leopards, but would even block the export licence for the Polish Leopards. Three sources familiar with the course of the conversation confirm to DIE ZEIT that this was the message that reached the White House.\n\nThe following five days become a phase of mutual probing and testing. On Thursday, two days after the telephone conversation between the two heads of government, the American Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin lands in Berlin. He has come to Ramstein to take part in an international conference on support for Ukraine. But before that, Austin wants to sound out whether the German position has changed in the meantime.\n\nHe meets with Wolfgang Schmidt and Jens Pl\u00f6tner. The conversation takes place in the meeting room on the sixth floor of the Chancellery, internally called the \"Kleine Lage\". Austin has his advisor for international issues, the US ambassador in Berlin and two staff members with him.\n\nBut Scholz's people do not move. They remain firm: without Abrams, no Leos.",

Annalena Baerbock will experience this in the summer and autumn months of 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Because in the weeks that follow: nothing happens.</p>\n\n<p>Scholz does not allow himself to be driven on the tank issue. On the contrary, the stronger the public pressure, the more stubborn the chancellor seems. Sometimes he seems almost defiant: when everyone wants him to declare his support for Nord Stream 2, he doesn&#39;t even utter the word. That&#39;s how it was a year ago, shortly before the outbreak of war. And it is similar now with the tank issue. He and his confidants always repeat their internal concerns: What if Ukraine attacks Russian territory with German tanks? What if Putin uses the delivery of battle tanks as a pretext for escalation? What about the unity of the West?</p>\n\n<p>The Foreign Office, on the other hand, emphasises that Putin is waging a war against the entire European peace order. In such a situation, one should &quot;not do things by halves&quot;. Moreover, the Foreign Office keeps receiving complaints from other countries about Scholz&#39;s dithering. Again and again, Baerbock has to justify her government&#39;s hesitancy in the Nato Foreign Ministers Council. Again and again, her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba presses for the delivery of battle tanks. This does not leave the Foreign Minister cold, on the contrary.</p>\n\n<p>Baerbock and Scholz - these are two types of politicians who hardly go together. Part of Baerbock&#39;s understanding of politics is to be touched. When she travels to Ukraine, she visits the destroyed cities. She wants to see the suffering left behind by the war. Afterwards, she often talks about what such an attack means for the children, how much her &quot;heart bleeds&quot;. Sometimes she struggles with tears.</p>\n\n<p>Part of Olaf Scholz&#39;s self-image is outward unaffectedness. He is convinced that decisions require a certain coldness. That one must not allow oneself to be seized and that one can only recognise risks if one blocks out one&#39;s own feelings.</p>\n\n<p>She speaks of values, he of interests. She wants a new self-confidence for German foreign policy. He thinks it&#39;s big talk.</p>\n\n<p>She drives him crazy. And he drives her crazy too.</p>\n\n<p>In November, the relationship between the two reaches a new low. Scholz plans a trip to China, Baerbock thinks the visit is a mistake. Shortly before his departure, she publicly declares that she expects the chancellor to stick to the coalition agreement, which talks about the &quot;systemic rivalry&quot; between China and the Federal Republic. She calls on Scholz to also address issues such as fair competition, human rights and recognition of international law during the visit. A foreign minister who publicly gives her boss rules of conduct for the trip - in the Chancellery, but also in other ministries, this is seen as presumptuous.</p>\n\n<p>In the midst of the biggest foreign policy crisis of the post-war period, there is an exchange between the chancellor and the foreign minister that insiders perceive as &quot;zero communication&quot;. With every step Baerbock dares to take, she seems to isolate herself further. There has also been no movement on the tank issue for weeks.</p>\n\n<p>A risky advance</p>\n\n<p>At the turn of the year, the situation changes. Russian troops advance at Bachmut, Putin announces a new wave of mobilisation, the intelligence services fear a breakthrough on the Ukrainian eastern front.</p>\n\n<p>On 5 January, Baerbock flies to London. The meeting is announced as a &quot;strategic dialogue&quot; between the Federal Republic and the United Kingdom. However, it seems that Baerbock is pursuing her very own strategy. According to ZEIT information, in a conversation with the British Foreign Minister James Cleverly, she advocates that the UK should be able to deliver Challenger tanks to Ukraine, and that it would then be seen how the German government behaved. She is obviously hoping for a domino effect. A risky move, especially in view of this history: the German Foreign Minister is lobbying an ally for tank deliveries - and leaves the impression that she wants to put the Chancellor under pressure once again.</p>\n\n<p>For Scholz has still not changed his view. On the same day that Baerbock is in London talking about British battle tanks and the possible influence on the German decision, the Chancellor is on the phone with Biden, and this conversation is also about tanks - just not battle tanks. The Chancellery later announces that Biden and Scholz have expressed their joint determination to support Ukraine for as long as necessary. &quot;To this end, the United States intends to provide Ukraine with Bradley-type infantry fighting vehicles and Germany intends to supply Marder-type infantry fighting vehicles&quot; - about the Leopard: not a word. While the German Foreign Minister is promoting battle tanks in London, the Chancellor is silent on the subject. The dissonance between the two could hardly be greater.</p>\n\n<p>Four days after Baerbock&#39;s visit, on 9 January, Britain announces its intention to ship Challenger tanks to Ukraine. Two days later, Poland&#39;s President Andrzej Duda holds out the prospect of supplying Leopard tanks from Polish stocks, the export of which would have to be approved by the German government. Within a few days, the pressure on Olaf Scholz has grown enormously.</p>\n\n<p>The repercussions of the London visit do not reach the Chancellor&#39;s Office via Baerbock, but by another route: the British get in touch. They say they made the decision in part to get the Germans to export Leopard tanks. Will anything move now? Scholz&#39;s people can&#39;t believe their ears.</p>\n\n<p>There is a momentum now, the whole world is talking about battle tanks from Germany, even Scholz will have to budge at some point. But on what terms?</p>\n\n<p>On 17 January, a Tuesday, at 4.15 p.m. German time, Scholz and Biden have another appointment to talk on the phone. At Biden&#39;s side are his National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Blinken. Scholz is surrounded by his closest confidants, including his foreign policy advisor Jens Pl\u00f6tner and Chancellery Chief Wolfgang Schmidt.</p>\n\n<p>This time it is mainly about the battle tanks. The conversation is shrouded in confidentiality; neither the Chancellery nor the White House want to comment on the content. But some details have leaked out in the Washington Post. Scholz had again pointed out that the green light for the Leopards would only be given if the Americans for their part delivered M1 Abrams battle tanks. One must proceed &quot;in lockstep&quot;, he said. &quot;I&#39;ll be in touch,&quot; Biden ends the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Washington Post, Biden, Blinken and Sullivan sat down together after the phone call and assessed the conversation: it had been &quot;disappointing&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This is also true because the Americans understood Scholz to say that without the US tanks he would not only not want to supply German Leopards, but would even block the export licence for the Polish Leopards. Three sources familiar with the course of the conversation confirm to DIE ZEIT that this was the message that reached the White House.</p>\n\n<p>The following five days become a phase of mutual probing and testing. On Thursday, two days after the telephone conversation between the two heads of government, the American Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin lands in Berlin. He has come to Ramstein to take part in an international conference on support for Ukraine. But before that, Austin wants to sound out whether the German position has changed in the meantime.</p>\n\n<p>He meets with Wolfgang Schmidt and Jens Pl\u00f6tner. The conversation takes place in the meeting room on the sixth floor of the Chancellery, internally called the &quot;Kleine Lage&quot;. Austin has his advisor for international issues, the US ambassador in Berlin and two staff members with him.</p>\n\n<p>But Scholz&#39;s people do not move. They remain firm: without Abrams, no Leos.</p>\n</div>",

The term \"annoyed\" is used, which means something between \"annoyed\" and \"annoyed\".\n\nBefore Austin flies back to Washington, the Germans build him a bridge: The Abrams tanks don't have to be delivered tomorrow or the day after. It's about the gesture. In such a scenario, the Abrams would not help Ukraine for many months. But sometimes in politics a symbol is more important than the concrete impact of a decision.\n\nWhile Austin flies back to Washington from Berlin with this message, a German delegation is travelling to Paris for the ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty. There, Annalena Baerbock gives an interview to the French television station LCI in the evening. When it comes to possible export applications for Leopard tanks, she says a sentence that is as short as it is explosive: \"If we were asked, we wouldn't stand in the way.\"\n\nEleven words with which the Foreign Minister stands up to the Chancellor. For while Scholz, in his conversation with Biden, gave the impression that he wanted to reject every export application as long as the Americans did not send their own tanks, Baerbock now declares en passant that export applications would be waved through. It is the opposite of the position with which Scholz is currently trying to get the Americans on his side. Baerbock is undermining Scholz's negotiating position, and the whole world is watching.\n\nThere were cautious signals from the Chancellor's Office at the working level that the position on export applications from Poland, for example, could change, it is later said. By all accounts, Baerbock knew nothing about the content of the Chancellor's conversation with Joe Biden. And while other government representatives in confidential talks this Sunday in Paris on the fringes of the ceremony let the certainty shimmer through that a German Leopard delivery is imminent, Baerbock apparently knows nothing about it.\n\nIt is now well known that Scholz is not an exuberant communicator. However, the fact that he is keeping even important cabinet members in the dark is now putting him in trouble himself.\n\nThe different temperaments, the strategic differences, the silence between the chancellor and the foreign minister - all this comes together in the tank issue. The government of the most powerful country in Europe does not manage to act in a coordinated way in this existential situation, that is the impression, even if a government spokeswoman says that the Chancellor is working \"closely and trustingly with all his ministers\". And the Foreign Office emphasises that in the run-up to the Leopard decision there had been \"an intensive exchange within the Federal Government, including between the Federal Foreign Minister and the Federal Chancellor\".\n\nOn Monday afternoon German time, the day after the ceremony in Paris, the decisive signals will arrive from the White House: The US President will go along. Abrams and Leos. Sullivan and Pl\u00f6tner, the two security advisers, have been on the phone and emailing all weekend, Austin has told Biden about the stubborn position in the Chancellery. The Washington Post reports that the US Secretary of Defence then recommended to Biden the long-term proposal that the Germans had given him on the way back: Abrams are to be delivered, but not from active US Army stocks, but reserve tanks that first have to be overhauled. Finally, the deal stands. \"We wanted to make sure we all stood together,\" Biden said at a White House press conference. \"We are in full and total agreement.\"\n\nBiden has already bailed out the German government once, against his own professional convictions, in spring 2021, when he unceremoniously lifted sanctions over the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Transatlantic solidarity was more important to him than punishing the recalcitrant Germans.\n\nScholz has prevailed\n\nWith the Abrams, this pattern repeats itself. The US president decides against the advice of his ministers to send a bigger message: that of the unity of the West. He accommodates the Germans. He gives Scholz confidence.\n\nThe fact that this unusual gift could come about also has to do with the special constellation of the two heads of government: In the Chancellor's Office there is a politician who is perhaps more stubborn than most of his predecessors. On the other side of the Atlantic, there is a president in the White House who is sometimes mellow with age, who is a friend of the good old transatlantic partnership and who, after the Trump years, is trying to repair what has fallen apart. One is unusually stubborn, the other unusually willing to compromise.\n\nIt is not too often in the relationship between the two countries that the president of the USA does something against his convictions and those of his advisors, just to get a German chancellor out from behind the barricade. Scholz has prevailed, but anyone who knows the Americans knows that everything has its price.\n\nAs with the \"turn of the times\", the battle tanks also show how over-controlled Scholz's politics are. After the Chancellor learns that the Americans have agreed to the deal, he calls Robert Habeck, the Vice-Chancellor, and Christian Lindner, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor. Scholz does not tell the other ministers about the tank turnaround until Wednesday morning in the cabinet - including Baerbock. At the very end of the meeting, under the agenda item \"Miscellaneous\", the Chancellor reads out an announcement in a monotone voice that will run through the news agencies only minutes later. The room goes quiet.\n\nBarely two weeks later, last Saturday, the Federal Foreign Minister is standing on a stage in a banquet hall in front of a crowd of jesters. On her head she wears a carnival hat, on this day Annalena Baerbock receives the \"Order against animal seriousness\" of the Aachen Carnival Association. She thought about her disguise for a long time, Baerbock begins her speech. \"Actually, I wanted to come as a leopard. But then I was a little worried that the Chancellor's Office wouldn't give me travel permission for weeks,\" she teases. \"So here I am, just as I am. A female foreign minister - without a visor.\" And that is still something exotic in this country.\n\nThen the Foreign Minister gets serious. I sometimes hear: \"Now she's talking about children again. Now she's getting emotional again.\" Baerbock pauses. \"Do you know what? I am glad that I - also as Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany - can say how close this is to me. I'm grateful that we live in a country where that's possible: where we politicians can show that the suffering we see doesn't leave us cold.\"\n\nThis is one version of how the story of the last few months can be told. There is a woman with convictions, moved by the fate of the people in Ukraine, who does not want to submit - and is finally marginalised by the men in the Chancellery.\n\nThere is, on the other hand, a foreign minister who does not seem to recognise the authority of the chancellor, who pursues her own policy and thus exposes her boss.\n\nAnd there are at least two stories about Olaf Scholz, too. For some, he is a man so opinionated that he turns half of Europe against Germany, until in the end the US president has to stand by him.\n\nFor others, he is a level-headed politician who tries to balance support for Ukraine with the dangers of military escalation - and in the end achieves more for Ukraine than his critics.\n\nNo matter which reading one believes, the damage done in the past months remains undeniable. The Foreign Minister gives the impression of trying to undermine the Chancellor's policy. The Chancellor cuts the Foreign Minister off from the flow of information.

As NATO member states ramp up weapons deliveries with battle tanks \u2013 and potentially air power \u2013 the Kremlin will struggle to fulfill its war aims, he said. \n\n>\u201cI am certain that Russia will not be able to break Ukraine,\u201d Rosin said in an interview in Tallinn after detailing the report on Wednesday. \u201cThe Russians indeed have a lot of resources \u2014 but the Russian economy is also taking blows, so Western decisiveness here is important.\u201d\n\n>The intelligence report said that while Russia is unlikely to achieve a \u201cquality leap\u201d in its war-fighting ability, Putin won\u2019t be deterred despite setbacks in the first year of the invasion. Key to his thinking is a weakening in support from allies such as the US and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \n\n>\u201cPutin is playing for time, believing that Ukraine and the West will wear out before Russia,\u201d the report said. \u201cPutin thinks he can \u2018bomb\u2019 Ukraine to the negotiating table.\u201d Last year\u2019s report accurately predicted that Putin\u2019s forces would be able to mount an invasion in the second half of February. \n\n>Even as Russian military planners were caught off guard by Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself and the scope of US and European Union sanctions, Putin\u2019s government shows no signs of buckling and is able to deploy the tools of \u201cpropaganda-induced imperialism,\u201d the report said. \n\n>>\u2018Radical\u2019 Factions in the Wings\n\n>\u201cUkraine must win this war, because if Russia wins, then the cost of the blow to Western security will be significantly greater than the financial contribution that is currently being made,\u201d Rosin said. \n\n>Russia\u2019s elite is increasingly concerned that Putin \u201chas gone mad, but most of them lack the courage to take real steps toward change,\u201d the report said. There is no significant grouping that embraces democratic values in a potential post-Putin Russia. \n\n>Instead, \u201cradical\u201d factions are vying for power. Those include Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Putin ally who leads the Wagner Group mercenary force that\u2019s been declared a transnational criminal organization by the US government \u2014 and Ramzan Kadyrov, the militant head of Russia\u2019s Chechnya region who has pilloried the Russian military for its failures. \n\n>The Estonian spies referred to the authoritarian regime under Putin as a Soviet Union 2.0, with \u201cno new Gorbachev, not to mention Yeltsin, on the horizon\u201d \u2014 a reference to the last Soviet leader who sought to liberalize the communist state and the first democratically elected Russian leader.\n\n>The intelligence agency is concerned that the invasion has heightened the risk of a military conflict in the Baltic region, with further mobilizations and Zapad 2023, the large-scale Russian military exercise planned for later this year, expected to ratchet up tension on NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\n\n>\u201cWe will likely see forces near our borders, we will see naval and air force activity on the Baltic Sea,\u201d Rosin said. \u201cThe aim of the exercise is probably to put military pressure on the West. It\u2019s unusual in that it\u2019s outside the scope of the usual schedule.\u201d\n\n>Seeing the Baltics as the most vulnerable region in the 30-member military alliance, Russia is \u201chighly likely\u201d to prioritize rebuilding its military near Estonia, something which could take as long as four years.\n\n\nHaving perused through the report, some things that stood out:\n\n>Russia probably plans to deploy its mobilised reserves at the end of their training in the first half of 2023 in a new offensive. Despite the losses suffered and problems in producing war materials and new weapon systems, Russia intends to continue its military action against Ukraine in 2023. To this end, the Kremlin plans to mobilise additional human and industrial resources to support the military action, looking for opportunities to source arms and ammunition from other countries, such as Iran, Belarus and North Korea.\n\n>Russian cyberattacks, like the actions of its armed forces, are likely aimed at wearing down Ukraine\u2019s cyber defenders and then finding the weakest link that would help achieve Russia\u2019s overall military goal \u2013 to wear down Ukraine, damage the international image and credibility of the Ukrainian leadership, reduce aid from allies, and undermine the society\u2019s morale. Therefore, a cyberattack need not actually disrupt an information system, as with each attack, investigators have to spend human and time resources to check whether and how extensively the information system has been attacked, how to improve defence, etc.\n\n>The use of Russian mobilised units for a new attack on Ukraine from the north would result in heavy losses for the Russian forces. Their progress would be hindered by the mobilised troops\u2019 low motivation and training, as well as the Ukrainians\u2019 preparedness for an attack from the north. The Belarusian army\u2019s involvement in the Ukrainian conflict would be a political gesture without significant strategic impact on the developments on the ground. However, it would still tie up some of Ukraine\u2019s forces.\n\n>First, the credibility of Russia\u2019s military deterrence in the South Caucasus and in the wider area of the former Soviet Union has significantly reduced, at least for the time being. The reasons for this are: (1) the Russian armed forces and military capabilities\u2019 engagement in Ukraine and (2) Russia\u2019s failure to achieve convincing military success in its aggression against Ukraine.\n\n>Second, the security guarantees offered by Russia bilaterally and within the framework of the CSTO have proved to be merely declarative.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-08/putin-is-playing-for-time-on-ukraine-estonian-spy-agency-says?srnd=politics-vp\">Russia Will Fail to \u2018Break\u2019 Ukraine, Estonia\u2019s Spy Chief Says</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Russia can\u2019t achieve \u2018quality leap,\u2019 but still has resources</p></li>\n<li><p>Estonian intelligence report sees no cracks in Putin\u2019s Russia</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Estonia\u2019s spy chief predicted a grinding conflict in Ukraine, with the war to be decided \u201con the battlefield,\u201d though he expressed optimism that Kyiv will prevail against Russian forces in the end.</p>\n\n<p>Kaupo Rosin, the director general of Estonia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service, spoke as the agency issued an annual report assessing that Vladimir Putin remains convinced that time is on his side as he draws from significant resources to feed his war machine. As NATO member states ramp up weapons deliveries with battle tanks \u2013 and potentially air power \u2013 the Kremlin will struggle to fulfill its war aims, he said. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am certain that Russia will not be able to break Ukraine,\u201d Rosin said in an interview in Tallinn after detailing the report on Wednesday. \u201cThe Russians indeed have a lot of resources \u2014 but the Russian economy is also taking blows, so Western decisiveness here is important.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The intelligence report said that while Russia is unlikely to achieve a \u201cquality leap\u201d in its war-fighting ability, Putin won\u2019t be deterred despite setbacks in the first year of the invasion. Key to his thinking is a weakening in support from allies such as the US and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cPutin is playing for time, believing that Ukraine and the West will wear out before Russia,\u201d the report said. \u201cPutin thinks he can \u2018bomb\u2019 Ukraine to the negotiating table.\u201d Last year\u2019s report accurately predicted that Putin\u2019s forces would be able to mount an invasion in the second half of February. </p>\n\n<p>Even as Russian military planners were caught off guard by Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself and the scope of US and European Union sanctions, Putin\u2019s government shows no signs of buckling and is able to deploy the tools of \u201cpropaganda-induced imperialism,\u201d the report said. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018Radical\u2019 Factions in the Wings</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cUkraine must win this war, because if Russia wins, then the cost of the blow to Western security will be significantly greater than the financial contribution that is currently being made,\u201d Rosin said. </p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s elite is increasingly concerned that Putin \u201chas gone mad, but most of them lack the courage to take real steps toward change,\u201d the report said. There is no significant grouping that embraces democratic values in a potential post-Putin Russia. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, \u201cradical\u201d factions are vying for power. Those include Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Putin ally who leads the Wagner Group mercenary force that\u2019s been declared a transnational criminal organization by the US government \u2014 and Ramzan Kadyrov, the militant head of Russia\u2019s Chechnya region who has pilloried the Russian military for its failures. </p>\n\n<p>The Estonian spies referred to the authoritarian regime under Putin as a Soviet Union 2.0, with \u201cno new Gorbachev, not to mention Yeltsin, on the horizon\u201d \u2014 a reference to the last Soviet leader who sought to liberalize the communist state and the first democratically elected Russian leader.</p>\n\n<p>The intelligence agency is concerned that the invasion has heightened the risk of a military conflict in the Baltic region, with further mobilizations and Zapad 2023, the large-scale Russian military exercise planned for later this year, expected to ratchet up tension on NATO\u2019s eastern flank.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe will likely see forces near our borders, we will see naval and air force activity on the Baltic Sea,\u201d Rosin said. \u201cThe aim of the exercise is probably to put military pressure on the West. It\u2019s unusual in that it\u2019s outside the scope of the usual schedule.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Seeing the Baltics as the most vulnerable region in the 30-member military alliance, Russia is \u201chighly likely\u201d to prioritize rebuilding its military near Estonia, something which could take as long as four years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having perused through the report, some things that stood out:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia probably plans to deploy its mobilised reserves at the end of their training in the first half of 2023 in a new offensive. Despite the losses suffered and problems in producing war materials and new weapon systems, Russia intends to continue its military action against Ukraine in 2023. To this end, the Kremlin plans to mobilise additional human and industrial resources to support the military action, looking for opportunities to source arms and ammunition from other countries, such as Iran, Belarus and North Korea.</p>\n\n<p>Russian cyberattacks, like the actions of its armed forces, are likely aimed at wearing down Ukraine\u2019s cyber defenders and then finding the weakest link that would help achieve Russia\u2019s overall military goal \u2013 to wear down Ukraine, damage the international image and credibility of the Ukrainian leadership, reduce aid from allies, and undermine the society\u2019s morale. Therefore, a cyberattack need not actually disrupt an information system, as with each attack, investigators have to spend human and time resources to check whether and how extensively the information system has been attacked, how to improve defence, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The use of Russian mobilised units for a new attack on Ukraine from the north would result in heavy losses for the Russian forces. Their progress would be hindered by the mobilised troops\u2019 low motivation and training, as well as the Ukrainians\u2019 preparedness for an attack from the north. The Belarusian army\u2019s involvement in the Ukrainian conflict would be a political gesture without significant strategic impact on the developments on the ground. However, it would still tie up some of Ukraine\u2019s forces.</p>\n\n<p>First, the credibility of Russia\u2019s military deterrence in the South Caucasus and in the wider area of the former Soviet Union has significantly reduced, at least for the time being. The reasons for this are: (1) the Russian armed forces and military capabilities\u2019 engagement in Ukraine and (2) Russia\u2019s failure to achieve convincing military success in its aggression against Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the security guarantees offered by Russia bilaterally and within the framework of the CSTO have proved to be merely declarative. Russia intervenes militarily to defend its \u201callies\u201d only when it is in its interest. But not when the alleged allies need help or when a treaty would require to do so. However, the CSTO has turned out to be a \u201cpaper tiger\u201d: a chatroom, not a serious defence organisation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

We've been doing it with field artillery for decades, throughout the GWOT. Before we used drones we used manned aircraft all the way up to Desert Storm. We're literally using drones and arty together in [Syria in 2020](https://coffeeordie.com/steel-rain-on-isis/). Where do you think Russia and Ukraine and everyone else got the idea from?\n\n>However, in the case of low-tech countries like Ukraine and Russia duking it out, indirect fire trumps all other tactics (with 90% of both forces being comprised of non-professional soldiers with minimal training).\n\nFirst, indirect is harder than direct fire. The latter is point and shoot, which any tank gun with modern fire control (pretty much everything T-64 or better) can do. The latter requires specialized equipment and knowledge on basic artillery gunnery plus a whole lot of math. For instance, if the drone flying at 270 degrees to target reports the round landed 400 meters south and 500 meters west, what does that translate to direction and declination in mils? I'm a former grunt with a decade plus, most as an NCO,  trained in being an observer to call for fire and even I think doing the calculations is tough enough to be considered magic (Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law).\n\nSecond, indirect fire doesn't trump all other tactics, it's just a way of hitting a target without the firer directly seeing the target and impacts themselves. \n\nConsidering the biggest threat to tanks in Ukraine that are not immediately in the forward edge of the battle area is artillery, they're still especially vulnerable especially since every time they fire at high trajectory they pop up on both counterbattery radars and sound tracking equipment, not to mention drones finding them helped by a mix of firing signature plus needing to be out from cover and concealment to shoot. They're only protecting themselves from very long range ATGM and tank fire, which they're worried about because they took so many losses in the last year doing stupid shit.\n\n>I'll even go as far as this: armed forces are a reflection of their societies, so even for professional soldiers in both Russia and Ukraine, you'd be horrified by what constitutes sufficient training and professionalism in both armies.\n\nI'm 100% sure I'd be horrified, which is why they should stick to the basics and try to get good at that.  \n\n>the use of drones + indirect fire is 100 times simpler and more effective to execute than maneuver warfare for both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIndirect fires, which are generally supposed to be observed if they're actually trying to hit within a grid square of a target, are not separate from maneuver warfare, they're actually part of it. Mortars and tube/rocket artillery are in maneuver units for a reason. Just that tanks aren't meant to perform indirect fire, and it's largely inefficient and wasteful to use them that way, especially because if the tanks are doing indirect, then who is doing tank shit? \n\n>Maneuvers with barely trained forces might get a lot of MBT/IFV destroyed, you resort to the easiest task.\n\nManeuver units with barely trained grunts and infantry are the same one with barely trained artillerymen, who don't maintain their pieces properly, shoot too slow or too fast, set up/displace too slow, miss, etc. Want to make them more effective? Train them, same as grunts and tankers. \n\n>Note how Wagner used barely any heavy equipment with success, while now Russians are attempting stuff with tanks in Vuhledar and they just blow themselves up on mines?\n\nWagner forces in Bakhmut were doing months of heavy casualty inducing dismounted attacks, mixing excons acting as probing forces with more elite formations akin to VDV and Spetsnaz, conducting day and night attacks, using every weapon system they could. Word is armor was limited because they were worried about AFV combat losses, plus terrain, mud, close proximity of opposing front lines, etc.\n\nVulhedar has a giant plain in front of it that the Russians have to cross to reach the city and field works around it held in strength by a large Ukrainian force. The Russians attacked with no tactical surprise and ran into mines and artillery fire while under UAF drone coverage. If they performed a dismounted attack they'd have gotten it worse because the no man's land is like a mile wide under observation the whole time, and that means under artillery fire the whole time. The only way to cross that means IFV and using those means using tanks. Russian tanks LARPing as artillery because they're afraid to risk their lives or vehicles to Ukrainian direct fire wouldn't fix that tactical problem.\n\n>Why is Ukraine seeking tanks and infantry fighting vehicles?\n\nBecause that's what's needed to go on the offensive.For both sides to achieve their strategic objectives, they need to successfully attack. Tanks and IFV blow shit up while hopefully not getting blown up, and they are pretty mobile too. The problem is that they still get blown up fairly regularly in battle, so they need more than a handful to succeed. \n\n>That's not a typical ratio of howitzers to tanks/ifvs in the Army, is it?\n\nA couple reasons. \n\nThey're desperately running low on 122 and 152 ammo, they need western guns to shoot more readily available western ammo. \n\nPlus, despite having 3x the paper strength artillery per brigade compared to most NATO countries, Ukraine still has less than Russia because they have less separate artillery brigades than Russia. The UAF General Staff want to outshoot the Russians, which means LOTS more artillery, which means creating lots more separate artillery brigades, which means lots more artillery being requested.\n\nPlus, the UAF General Staff want to create western equipped corps sized offensive maneuver units, those will need arty in their maneuver brigades too.",

Just that tanks aren&#39;t meant to perform indirect fire, and it&#39;s largely inefficient and wasteful to use them that way, especially because if the tanks are doing indirect, then who is doing tank shit? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maneuvers with barely trained forces might get a lot of MBT/IFV destroyed, you resort to the easiest task.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maneuver units with barely trained grunts and infantry are the same one with barely trained artillerymen, who don&#39;t maintain their pieces properly, shoot too slow or too fast, set up/displace too slow, miss, etc. Want to make them more effective? Train them, same as grunts and tankers. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note how Wagner used barely any heavy equipment with success, while now Russians are attempting stuff with tanks in Vuhledar and they just blow themselves up on mines?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wagner forces in Bakhmut were doing months of heavy casualty inducing dismounted attacks, mixing excons acting as probing forces with more elite formations akin to VDV and Spetsnaz, conducting day and night attacks, using every weapon system they could. Word is armor was limited because they were worried about AFV combat losses, plus terrain, mud, close proximity of opposing front lines, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Vulhedar has a giant plain in front of it that the Russians have to cross to reach the city and field works around it held in strength by a large Ukrainian force. The Russians attacked with no tactical surprise and ran into mines and artillery fire while under UAF drone coverage. If they performed a dismounted attack they&#39;d have gotten it worse because the no man&#39;s land is like a mile wide under observation the whole time, and that means under artillery fire the whole time. The only way to cross that means IFV and using those means using tanks. Russian tanks LARPing as artillery because they&#39;re afraid to risk their lives or vehicles to Ukrainian direct fire wouldn&#39;t fix that tactical problem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is Ukraine seeking tanks and infantry fighting vehicles?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because that&#39;s what&#39;s needed to go on the offensive.For both sides to achieve their strategic objectives, they need to successfully attack. Tanks and IFV blow shit up while hopefully not getting blown up, and they are pretty mobile too. The problem is that they still get blown up fairly regularly in battle, so they need more than a handful to succeed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s not a typical ratio of howitzers to tanks/ifvs in the Army, is it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A couple reasons. </p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re desperately running low on 122 and 152 ammo, they need western guns to shoot more readily available western ammo. </p>\n\n<p>Plus, despite having 3x the paper strength artillery per brigade compared to most NATO countries, Ukraine still has less than Russia because they have less separate artillery brigades than Russia. The UAF General Staff want to outshoot the Russians, which means LOTS more artillery, which means creating lots more separate artillery brigades, which means lots more artillery being requested.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, the UAF General Staff want to create western equipped corps sized offensive maneuver units, those will need arty in their maneuver brigades too.</p>\n</div>",

You&#39;re not there killing anyone, you&#39;re just providing wifi to people whose homes got blown up and to soldiers in foxholes defending their land. The <em>Pentagon</em> might help someone go kill people using <em>electronics</em> they <em>buy</em> from a <em>totally</em> different part of your company, but c&#39;est la vie.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can also see them simply pushing back against a scarce commodity, the terminals, being used as if they were disposable. Especially having already been asked at least once (presumably more) for another bunch of free terminals plus a monthly free supply.</p>\n\n<p>Safe to say there&#39;s no Russian threat against the Starlink constellation itself, their (non-nuclear) capability to impact it at all is negligible. Which limits their options to: creating a huge mess in the right part of LEO and hoping for the best. If you think invading Ukraine gets you pariah status, wait until you get into indiscriminate, gajillion-dollar, global vandalism. Especially when there&#39;s a good chance it doesn&#39;t even work.</p>\n</div>",

I just watched the interview, couldn't find any major news outlet talking about the claims mentioned, and therefor turned to reddit to discuss the matter. That's all.My **intention was never to spread dis/misinformation**. I sincerely interpreted Bennett's claims in the way that I have presented it. This could of course be a flawed interpretation. However, even if my interpretation *was* flawed, looking at what Bennett says in the interview (or according to the subtitles, anyhow, since I do not speak Hebrew), I find it hard to accuse it for being *blatantly and obviously* flawed.\n\nMy reasoning went like this:\n\n* Bennett says at 2:53:15: **\u201dI was under the impression that both sides very much wanted a ceasefire\u201d.**\n* He continues to talk about the concessions both sides have made. For Putin this regards denazification, and for Zelenskyy the demands for joining NATO.\n* At 2:54:18 Bennetts says: \u201dThen I updated everyone one after the other\u201d, and goes through the different approaches of the Western leaders, with Johnson \u201dadopting the aggressive line\u201d, Macron and Scholz being more \u201dpragmatic\u201d, and the US being \u201dboth\u201d (this section ends around 2:57:22).\n* Thereafter Bennett says he went back to Israel (after having been to both Russia and Germany) to **start drawing up deals**.\n* Around 2:59:30 he comments on the work with those deals: \u201dIt went back and forth. I\u2019ll say this in the broad sense. **I think there was a legitimate decision by the west to keep striking Putin**\". He clarifies: \u201dI mean the more aggressive approach\u201d. And acknowledges: \u201dI can\u2019t say if they were wrong\u201d.\n* Then he shortly underlines his role as a negotiator, and at 3:00:23 says: \u201dI turn to America in this regard. I don\u2019t do as I please. **Anything I did was coordinated down to the last detail with the US, Germany and France.\u201dInterviewer asks: \u201dSo they blocked it?\u201dBennett: \u201dBasically, yes.** They blocked it and I thought they\u2019re wrong. In retrospect, it\u2019s too soon to know\u201d.\n\nFeel free to criticise my logic or that I have missed essential details, but this was my sincere reading of the interview.\n\nEDIT: I see now that the part about \"ceasefire had been negotiated and was on the table\", and the title not being something like \"...attempts for ceasefire...\" was bad wording on my side, really sorry for that..",

Arms are flowing in, money and \"free credit\" is given (basically credit that they will need to start paying back in 10-30 years with much lower then inflation rates), humanitarian aid, etc. while russia is being choked by multiple sides with sanctions. However Ukraine has at least two achilles heels. They are dependent on the aid of the freeworld (but that is a pool that dwarfs all that russia can even dream about) and their \"manpower\" is a smaller pool then russia, significantly. So ever Ukrainian death hurts more then the russians. However, russia has a worst ratio of \"combat able\" population (relative ofc, you can give a rifle to anyone technically, if you have the rifle).\n\nThe thing with russia's degradetion is that it is much more calculable. They are not that dependent on foreign actors good will. It is questionable how long can they keep this up, but if this is really an ongoing offensive, which looks like it is, that is good news, cause it does not have the weight behind it that many here expected. (We are still talking about many 100s of armored vehicles and many 10ks of troops, missiles etc) At this point, Ukrain seems to be absorbing it and if they are actually able to save up material during it, thats very good! Whatever russia has thrown at them (initial attack, energy diplomacy to cut out allies, world wide propaganda, traitors, drones/missiles, energy infrastructure attack, 2. and 3. offensive and who knows what I left out) they seems to have stalled, relatively speaking. Still, russia is one or two weight class above Ukraine. That is not something that should ever be forgotten.\n\nI cannot tell you how it will go, but I would put my money on Ukraine at this point. It will be bloody, it will be hard, but as long as their spirit holds, there is a way. If nothing changes significantly, which is far from sure, they will be able to break the russians. The attackers will just face a force that has capabilities above what they can field/counter and no matter what their propagandist are saying, the grunt on the line will fell it. If they really are aaving up ... but we dont know.\n\nAt that point I fear what might come, but honestly, I dont see a big chance for the WMD / NCB threats to materilaize.\n\nThis will be long however and it is something to brace yourself, your love and your family/friends for. I would say the very minimum is 6-9 months and that is the very very, lottery, lucky scenario. More like a year and a half or more. Just from the avg loss projections + the largely unknow russian MIC  production. So, prepare mentally for the long haul, dont search for the end, dont hope. Just push, until it is over.\n\nThe good news that you should concentrateon, that you guys already won. Family outside of the threat zone, the country did not collapse and never will this war. As they say, war is the anvil that forge nations, russia asked a question and got an answer from Ukraine. The entire world heard it.\n\nUkraine has already won in the strategic sense. The acces to the black sea is secured, the Dnipro is secured, the russian capability to infiltrate and control the country is diminished or utterly broken. If the spirit carries on, unity might flourish after the war in a never before seen magnitude.\n\nAll that remains is the landbridge that might be taken, but even for that, I would put my money on Ukraine for now. Pre 2014 borders? I am not so sure, but they ARE in the cards which is honestly laughable if you think about that this is an invasion initiated by russia.\n\nI would say the next 6 months will tell us a lot. If russia is unable to field a strong offensive (lossing Bhakmut wouldnt be one, no matter how anybody would panic and make articles about it), if western aid ramps up, if Ukrainians decide to keep standing against tyrany then russia has a bad hand. If Ukraine can push a Kherson/Kharkiv level offensive, theought the landbridge to Melitopol or anywhere to the Azov sea AND HOLD that, the russia has an even shorter timer.\n\nAa I started I mention again as this is a long post, nobody knows. There might be significant reserves in the russian armed forces and Ukraine is spending everything it can just to hold. Don't hope. You don't need to, but do what you can.",

If Ukraine can push a Kherson/Kharkiv level offensive, theought the landbridge to Melitopol or anywhere to the Azov sea AND HOLD that, the russia has an even shorter timer.</p>\n\n<p>Aa I started I mention again as this is a long post, nobody knows. There might be significant reserves in the russian armed forces and Ukraine is spending everything it can just to hold. Don&#39;t hope. You don&#39;t need to, but do what you can.</p>\n</div>",

Russia's earliest occupations relied on a lot of things they cannot now replicate, such as the element of surprise, turncoat commanders leaving gaps in the line, and everyone's feeling that Russia was much more competent than it was, etc. Since that initial phase was over, all that Russia has managed is vastly smaller land grabs after extremely long and grinding attritional battles, battles which also helped create the conditions for further Ukrainian breakthroughs.\n\nThe one big change has been Russia's mobilization. Nobody has any reliable information as to what this has done for their forces. It could be that it will finally enable them to overwhelm Ukrainian forces by operating closer to their paper strength in all their previously understrength battalions. But even if they have more mass, I don't think anyone believes the mobilization is going to increase the quality or finesse of the Russian forces, if anything it will dilute the use of what resources they have. So while the blows may become stronger, their aim will likely be weaker. \n\nUndoubtedly Ukraine's best bet, in a very general sense, is to be the more clever military, the scrappier opponent that uses economy of force to make sure that Russia's bigger formations and more numerous materiel are never in a position to score those blows. In practical terms, what does this mean? It means more precision strikes on Russian stockpiles that render them unable to use their artillery advantage. It means the effective employment of defense in depth and favorable terrain wherever the Russians choose to focus, so that they are bled out slowly in lopsided battles, and they can never gain momentum. It means focusing forces Ukraine's limited mobile assets into opportunistic breakthroughs like at Kharkiv, and encircling and capturing Russian forces before they ever know what is going on.\n\nNobody can predict something so broad as the outcome of a war like this, but I do think that there is a reasonable case to be made for the Ukraine winning in a repeat of what we have seen so far. Russia is a fractally corrupt nation, a place where incompetence is a prerequisite for regime stability, seemingly incapable of making full use of its large resources. Ukraine for all its flaws is a more open society seemingly more capable of adapting to the crisis, and effectively marshalling its smaller resources.

The attack was soon revealed to have been a deliberate act but no culprit has yet been identified.    \n> \n> Hersh, 85, who broke stories such as the mass murder of 500 civilians at My Lai in Vietnam and the torture of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, says that the \u201cBlack Op\u201d was ordered by President Biden, and that the attack was carried out by the CIA in co-operation with Norway.  \n> \n> In a 5,000-word report published on the online publishing platform Substack, Hersh writes that the operation was disguised \u201cunder the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as Baltic Operations 22 or BALTOPS 22\u201d, which was conducted in June off the coast of Germany.  \n> \n> He says that Biden\u2019s decision to sabotage the pipelines came after more than nine months of top-secret planning within the American national security community. \u201cFor much of that time, the issue was not whether to do the mission, but how to get it done with no overt clue as to who was responsible,\u201d Hersh has written.    \n> \n> Once hailed \u201cthe greatest American investigative reporter\u201d, Hersh\u2019s more recent stories have been called into question. These included articles over how the US found Osama bin Laden and doubting the use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians by Syria\u2019s regime, which were criticised for relying heavily on anonymous sources and lacking hard evidence.  \n> \n> In his report on Nord Stream, Hersh has quoted an anonymous source \u201cwith direct knowledge of the operational planning\u201d. He said that deep-sea divers from the US Navy\u2019s Diving and Salvage Centre in Panama City, Florida, the largest diving facility in the world, planted C4 explosives alongside the pipeline, which were later triggered by a sonar buoy dropped by a plane.  \n> \n> Hersh has claimed that on September 26, 2022, a Norwegian Navy P8 surveillance plane made \u201ca seemingly routine flight\u201d and released the sonar buoy. \u201cThe signal spread underwater, initially to Nord Stream 2 and then on to Nord Stream 1,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA few hours later, the high-powered C4 explosives were triggered and three of the four pipelines were put out of commission. Within a few minutes, pools of methane gas that remained in the shuttered pipelines could be seen spreading on the water\u2019s surface and the world learned that something irreversible had taken place.\u201d  \n>   \n> Nord Stream is run by a Swiss-based company whose major shareholder is Gazprom, the Russian energy giant. Russia has spent about $20 billion building the pipelines. Nord Stream 2, which was completed in 2021, was not yet operational at the time of the sabotage.  \n> \n> Hersh notes that Biden and his foreign policy team, which includes his national security adviser Jake Sullivan, his secretary of state Antony Blinken and under secretary of state for political affairs Victoria Nuland, had spoken out against Nord Stream 2, which would have yoked Europe to Russian gas for decades.  \n> \n> It would also have increased the Kremlin\u2019s political influence over the continent at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and the West and significantly boosted revenue for Russia. Nord Stream 2, alone, would have doubled gas supply already provided by Nord Stream 1.  \n> \n> In February 2022, just weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while discussing possible sanctions against Moscow, Biden warned: \u201cIf Russia invades (. . .) there will no longer be a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.\u201d  \n> \n> Hersh\u2019s anonymous source says that, because of the president\u2019s threat, destroying the pipeline \u201cno longer could be considered a covert option because the president just announced that we knew how to do it\u201d.  \n> \n> \u201cThe plan to blow up Nord Stream 1 and 2 was suddenly downgraded from a covert operation requiring that Congress be informed to one that was deemed as a highly classified intelligence operation with US military support,\u201d Hersh has written. According to Hersh\u2019s source, \u201cthere was no longer a legal requirement to report the operation to Congress. All they had to do now was just do it\u201d.  \n> \n> Hersh\u2019s report comes after Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, alleged last week that the attack had been carried out by Washington in an attempt to ensure its global dominance. Moscow had previously accused the British Royal Navy of blowing up the pipelines but did not provide evidence.  \n> \n> Last week, The Times revealed that German investigators remained open to theories that a western state carried out the bombing with the aim of blaming it on Russia. The explosions are also being investigated by Denmark and Sweden.  \n> \n> Some western officials initially suspected the Kremlin although they stopped short of formally accusing Moscow. However, 23 diplomatic and intelligence officials in nine different western countries told the Washington Post recently that they had yet to see evidence linking Russia to the attack, with some saying they did not believe Russia was to blame. President Putin\u2019s spokesman said allegations that Russia would cripple its own pipelines were \u201cstupid and absurd\u201d.  \n> \n> After the attack, Washington rejected allegations that the US was involved. \u201cThe idea that the United States was in any way involved in the apparent sabotage of these pipelines is preposterous. It is nothing more than a function of Russian disinformation and should be treated as such,\u201d the US State Department said.",

To quote Blinken:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing his imperial designs&quot; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no real risk to NATO.  Germany&#39;s not going to abandoned the cornerstone of their security over this.  They&#39;re going to play along with the &quot;Russia did it narrative&quot; to save face and move on.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "The announcement of UK fighter pilot training today brought up some interesting discussion.  There has been a lot of talk about F-16s and Gripens, but not a lot of talk about Eurofighter Typhoon T1.\n\nThe first generation variants (T1) are, similar to the first gen variants of the F-35, apparently very difficult and costly to upgrade to the most modern equipment, and several European users of these airframes are planning to retire them (the T1s) by the end of the decade, starting with the UK retiring 30 airframes in 2027.  Other operators are Italy, Spain, and Germany, and of those I found sources that Germany is planning to retire theirs, and Italy has been seeking secondhand buyers for some of their T1s.\n\nhttps://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/uk-to-retire-tranche-1-typhoons-with-more-than-half-of-airframe-hours-remaining\n\nhttps://www.airforce-technology.com/features/typhhon-eurofighter-royal-air-force-raf-uk-f-35/\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/germany-approves-billion-euro-purchase-of-38-eurofighter-jets/a-55513389\n\nhttps://www.eurofighter.com/news-and-events/2018/10/italian-eurofighter-proposal-submitted-to-bulgaria\n\n>The answer as to why the MOD decided to retire Tranche 1 aircraft earlier is simple. They are the oldest jets in the Typhoon fleet and keeping them until 2040 would not be economically wise. Some of the oldest ones, like the Typhoon T1 two-seaters, have been already retired.\n\n>Bronk says: \u201cThe Tranche 1s are older and they\u2019re much less reliable. They\u2019re less capable of taking a lot of the modern upgrades. What this is leading to is the RAF having two different fleets within the fleet. That this because the older tranche ones have to have a different standard of upgrades, software and sensors because they\u2019re not internally modified to take some of the later upgrades.\u201d\n\nSo what we have here is a plane that\n\n* Is relatively modern\n* Yet, lacks the most sensitive and advanced avionics and weapons systems\n* Which is available in a relevant quantity\n* Yet many countries may be somewhat more willing to part with, and even risk losing, as the shelf life on them is limited anyway and having a mixed fleet complicates logistics\n* Several European countries operate, and can train for and perform maintenance on\n\nThe downside is that these jets are supposedly less reliable than newer variants, but are they less reliable relative to Ukraine's aging Soviet aircraft?  The biggest problem would be backfilling these jets, but it would seem that they are not the preferred backbone of active duty fleets in any case.\n\nDoes this seem like a viable option, perhaps even one of the most viable options, relative to what has been discussed previously?",

Other operators are Italy, Spain, and Germany, and of those I found sources that Germany is planning to retire theirs, and Italy has been seeking secondhand buyers for some of their T1s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/uk-to-retire-tranche-1-typhoons-with-more-than-half-of-airframe-hours-remaining\">https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/uk-to-retire-tranche-1-typhoons-with-more-than-half-of-airframe-hours-remaining</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.airforce-technology.com/features/typhhon-eurofighter-royal-air-force-raf-uk-f-35/\">https://www.airforce-technology.com/features/typhhon-eurofighter-royal-air-force-raf-uk-f-35/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-approves-billion-euro-purchase-of-38-eurofighter-jets/a-55513389\">https://www.dw.com/en/germany-approves-billion-euro-purchase-of-38-eurofighter-jets/a-55513389</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eurofighter.com/news-and-events/2018/10/italian-eurofighter-proposal-submitted-to-bulgaria\">https://www.eurofighter.com/news-and-events/2018/10/italian-eurofighter-proposal-submitted-to-bulgaria</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The answer as to why the MOD decided to retire Tranche 1 aircraft earlier is simple. They are the oldest jets in the Typhoon fleet and keeping them until 2040 would not be economically wise. Some of the oldest ones, like the Typhoon T1 two-seaters, have been already retired.</p>\n\n<p>Bronk says: \u201cThe Tranche 1s are older and they\u2019re much less reliable. They\u2019re less capable of taking a lot of the modern upgrades. What this is leading to is the RAF having two different fleets within the fleet. That this because the older tranche ones have to have a different standard of upgrades, software and sensors because they\u2019re not internally modified to take some of the later upgrades.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what we have here is a plane that</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is relatively modern</li>\n<li>Yet, lacks the most sensitive and advanced avionics and weapons systems</li>\n<li>Which is available in a relevant quantity</li>\n<li>Yet many countries may be somewhat more willing to part with, and even risk losing, as the shelf life on them is limited anyway and having a mixed fleet complicates logistics</li>\n<li>Several European countries operate, and can train for and perform maintenance on</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The downside is that these jets are supposedly less reliable than newer variants, but are they less reliable relative to Ukraine&#39;s aging Soviet aircraft?  The biggest problem would be backfilling these jets, but it would seem that they are not the preferred backbone of active duty fleets in any case.</p>\n\n<p>Does this seem like a viable option, perhaps even one of the most viable options, relative to what has been discussed previously?</p>\n</div>",
