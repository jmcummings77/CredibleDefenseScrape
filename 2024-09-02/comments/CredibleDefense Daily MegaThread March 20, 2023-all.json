        "body": "Time for more F-16 discussion. What are your thoughts on this? (Extremely long article slightly edited for brevity)\n\n[Ukrainian chief of aviation says that 2 Ukrainian pilots finished 3 weeks of assessment on an F-16 simulator and that pilots could be trained to operate F-16s in under 6 months](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ukraine-air-chief-our-pilots-can-master-f-16-jets-in-under-six-months-dz7bfvqn5)\n\n> An American assessment of Ukrainian fighter pilots has revealed they would be ready to fly F-16 jets after fewer than six months of training, their commander has told The Times.\n\n>In his first interview since President Putin\u2019s tanks crossed the border last year, General Serhii Holubtsov, chief of aviation of Ukraine\u2019s air force, said that two of his pilots had returned to the country last week after a rigorous assessment by the US military.\n\n>\u201cThey spent three weeks there and were trained on an F-16 simulator how to fly together as two pilots using weapons. The results came out very good: Ukrainian pilots can learn to fly and operate weapons systems on the F-16 in less than six months,\u201d he said.\n\n> Some Nato allies had previously thought it would take years to train Ukrainian pilots, who are fighting an armada of more advanced Russian fighters using a small number of antiquated MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft. Last month Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, suggested that a British training programme for Ukrainian pilots would be completed only after the war had finished.\n\n>Holubtsov said some pilots could be trained in an even shorter period: \u201cThe skills of the pilots were rated extremely highly, and these guys were just average pilots. Every pilot is unique, so there should be an individual training plan. But after this assessment, we can significantly shorten the term depending on the previous experience of Ukrainian pilots. This is great news for us.\u201d\n\n>Last month President Biden said the US would not be providing F-16s \u201cfor now\u201d, with Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, arguing they \u201care not a question for the short-term fight\u201d.

(Extremely long article slightly edited for brevity)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ukraine-air-chief-our-pilots-can-master-f-16-jets-in-under-six-months-dz7bfvqn5\">Ukrainian chief of aviation says that 2 Ukrainian pilots finished 3 weeks of assessment on an F-16 simulator and that pilots could be trained to operate F-16s in under 6 months</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An American assessment of Ukrainian fighter pilots has revealed they would be ready to fly F-16 jets after fewer than six months of training, their commander has told The Times.</p>\n\n<p>In his first interview since President Putin\u2019s tanks crossed the border last year, General Serhii Holubtsov, chief of aviation of Ukraine\u2019s air force, said that two of his pilots had returned to the country last week after a rigorous assessment by the US military.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey spent three weeks there and were trained on an F-16 simulator how to fly together as two pilots using weapons. The results came out very good: Ukrainian pilots can learn to fly and operate weapons systems on the F-16 in less than six months,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Some Nato allies had previously thought it would take years to train Ukrainian pilots, who are fighting an armada of more advanced Russian fighters using a small number of antiquated MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft. Last month Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, suggested that a British training programme for Ukrainian pilots would be completed only after the war had finished.</p>\n\n<p>Holubtsov said some pilots could be trained in an even shorter period: \u201cThe skills of the pilots were rated extremely highly, and these guys were just average pilots. Every pilot is unique, so there should be an individual training plan. But after this assessment, we can significantly shorten the term depending on the previous experience of Ukrainian pilots. This is great news for us.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Last month President Biden said the US would not be providing F-16s \u201cfor now\u201d, with Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, arguing they \u201care not a question for the short-term fight\u201d. The results of the assessment may force them to reappraise that view.

Most significant observations about large scale combat operations\n2. Is it surprising how the war has played out vs prevalence of long range precision fires?\n3. Are Ukrainians and Russians employing dispersion?\n4. How to address the tension between the need to disperse and the need to coordinate? \n5.

Have you got an estimate of how many IFVs they have left, not taking into account the promised/delivered western stuff?\n\nOne problem with this war is that there are wild estimates of pre-war stuff for both ukrainian and russian ground forces. According to Wikipedia, citing The military balance, ukraine possessed several thousands of IFV/APCs prior to the war. But they're frequently asking for more and more and more IFV/APCs, a sign that there are insufficient quantities of these vehicles. According to Oryx, they \"only\" lost less than 700 of such vehicles, so the reality is that likely the \"several thousands\" figure reported by wikipedia is completely untrue.\n\nBut I wouldn't say that they have very few tracked IFV/APCs left, they probably have some several hundreds of them, not counting western ones (mainly wheeled ones, for now).\n\nI doubt that they're counting only on western deliveries, it'd be hard to make an offensive that ambitious using only 200/250 western tracked IFVs that will arrive at different times. They will certainly be a big boost to their capabilities, but they won't do anything alone.\n\nIt is likely that the majority of their vehicles are assigned to the units that will be employed in future offensive(s) later this year and that are training/forming for this purpose. I recommend a post by a guy here that tracks all the newly formed units for more info.\n\nAlso another guy, yesterday, posted an estimate that puts the number of replaced tanks (soviet ones) at almost the same figure than the total tanks that ukraine lost, so tanks shouldn't be a problem for the future, although western countries promised more modern tanks in the future.",

But they&#39;re frequently asking for more and more and more IFV/APCs, a sign that there are insufficient quantities of these vehicles. According to Oryx, they &quot;only&quot; lost less than 700 of such vehicles, so the reality is that likely the &quot;several thousands&quot; figure reported by wikipedia is completely untrue.</p>\n\n<p>But I wouldn&#39;t say that they have very few tracked IFV/APCs left, they probably have some several hundreds of them, not counting western ones (mainly wheeled ones, for now).</p>\n\n<p>I doubt that they&#39;re counting only on western deliveries, it&#39;d be hard to make an offensive that ambitious using only 200/250 western tracked IFVs that will arrive at different times. They will certainly be a big boost to their capabilities, but they won&#39;t do anything alone.</p>\n\n<p>It is likely that the majority of their vehicles are assigned to the units that will be employed in future offensive(s) later this year and that are training/forming for this purpose. I recommend a post by a guy here that tracks all the newly formed units for more info.</p>\n\n<p>Also another guy, yesterday, posted an estimate that puts the number of replaced tanks (soviet ones) at almost the same figure than the total tanks that ukraine lost, so tanks shouldn&#39;t be a problem for the future, although western countries promised more modern tanks in the future.</p>\n</div>",

Keep in mind that most losses are recorded after one side takes the territory of another. Since Russia has spent most of the war on the offensive, they should be able to report more Ukrainian losses as they've taken far more ground. On top of that, Russian equipment losses from HIMARS can pretty much only be verified by Russian self-reporting as they are not used in conjunction with spotting drones like most artillery is. \n\nBut let's just say there actually is a significant gap in reported losses, and Ukrainian losses are 20% less visually confirmed than Russian losses. That would still put Ukrainian losses as of today at around 3,700 compared with the currently confirmed losses of Russia at 9,740. It would *still* put the ratio of losses at more than 1:2.5. \n\n>IFVs and APCs are what Ukraine is asking for most, so either they have a deficiency or their views of how to take land are predicated on having a lot more than they did before the war. \n\nUkraine has a deficiency in the amount of IFVs/APCs they need since they have effectively doubled the size of their force since 2022. They need a lot more armored vehicles to equip their units as mechanized brigades which is their preferred formation. \n\n>The videos from Zaporizhzhia going around the last few days point to M113s not being enough to overcome hardened defenses, but 200/250 Western IFVs isn't going to be enough.\n\nThat's because M113s aren't supposed to be used to storm enemy positions or provide fire support, they're battle taxis meant to quickly move infantry to and from the front. Of course they're not going to perform well if they're being used improperly. I do agree with your point that Ukraine needs far more Western IFVs like Marders and Bradleys though. I expect they will receive many more in the coming months, though I'm a bit disappointed at the pace so far.",

                            "body": "1. US import dependence on China for critical materials. A few examples: the US can onshore chip factories, but it cannot make chips without silicon, almost all of which is imported from China. Yes, silicon is a common material in the earths crust, but it takes time to get the infrastructure in place to start ripping up American river beds and refining the material for chip plants. This infra does not exist in the US, and there are no plans on the horizon to build it. It would have to be done in the panic after an export ban (a likely contingency in the event of US/China war or blockade) \n\n  Magnesium is another example. You can't make the F-35 without magnesium, not to mention most other military weapons. China and \nRussia together produce about 80-85% of the world's supply and you can't even stockpile it because it turns to magnesium oxide in a matter of months. The cost to China of ending imports of silicon and magnesium is pocket change. About 20 billion dollars a year. The fallout to the US military and economic machine is probably several orders of magnitude greater than that. \n\n2. China has a strategic initiative in place to secure it's economic independence called \"Fortress China Initiative\". It's why they focus so hard on renewables and it's also why they have multiple initiatives for food independence. Depending on how you measure it, they are food indendepent already. (no Chinese would starve with imports cut off, but they wouldn't enjoy the diets high in beef and soy etc... that they enjoy today) \n\n   The BRI is also an element of this. They have secured gas pipelines from central Asia and Russia and are building more as we speak. They are building exclusive-rights ports in other countries that connect to China by land so that an effective blockade would result in the US declaring war on multiple countries aside from China. \n\n3. Blockading 1.4 billion people requires an extreme level of escalation, and it would also most likely result in a shooting war that the US would have to fire the first shot in. A naval war in the South China Sea *today* is not a surefire US win per the Pentagon, and in 10-20 years, the odds worsen.   \n\n   What's more, Chinese trade links with foreign countries also raise the stakes. Take for instance, the Brazilian economy which is hugely (I would say entirely) dependent on imports and exports to China. If the USN starts sinking or seizing vessels full of Brazilian beef or Kenyan coffee or Saudi oil, the US will quickly lose international support in their war. \n\n4. Chinese demographics are not great. This is true. The US has the advantage of immigration, this is also true. But the consequences will take a *long* time to play out. By 2050, the US population will be about 350 million, slightly larger than it is today, but the average population age will be older than China's in 2050. In other words, the average Chinese will be younger than the average American, and the Chinese population will still be 3-4x the size of the US population. I would not say that is \"implosion\" in 20 years, I would say China is in the better demographic position in 20 years.\n\n    By 2150, things will look far more in favor of the US, based on current trends, but 130 projects are hard to model, and the geopolitics of 2150 are impossible to apprehend today. \n\n    In addition to this point, an \"advantage\" of authoritarians is that you can handle problems related to issues like demography in ways that democracies cannot. You can see Paris is on fire over a 2 year increase in the retirement age, a consequence of slowing/falling population growth. In China, these issues are not so difficult to resolve. \n\nThese are some of many points that complicate any type of Chinese/US confrontation. Their relationship does not exist in a vacuum and China has built their entire military for the purpose of facing off with the US, while the US has built their military for a number of different purposes.",

You can&#39;t make the F-35 without magnesium, not to mention most other military weapons. China and \nRussia together produce about 80-85% of the world&#39;s supply and you can&#39;t even stockpile it because it turns to magnesium oxide in a matter of months. The cost to China of ending imports of silicon and magnesium is pocket change. About 20 billion dollars a year. The fallout to the US military and economic machine is probably several orders of magnitude greater than that. </p></li>\n<li><p>China has a strategic initiative in place to secure it&#39;s economic independence called &quot;Fortress China Initiative&quot;. It&#39;s why they focus so hard on renewables and it&#39;s also why they have multiple initiatives for food independence. Depending on how you measure it, they are food indendepent already. (no Chinese would starve with imports cut off, but they wouldn&#39;t enjoy the diets high in beef and soy etc... that they enjoy today) </p>\n\n<p>The BRI is also an element of this. They have secured gas pipelines from central Asia and Russia and are building more as we speak. They are building exclusive-rights ports in other countries that connect to China by land so that an effective blockade would result in the US declaring war on multiple countries aside from China. </p></li>\n<li><p>Blockading 1.4 billion people requires an extreme level of escalation, and it would also most likely result in a shooting war that the US would have to fire the first shot in. A naval war in the South China Sea <em>today</em> is not a surefire US win per the Pentagon, and in 10-20 years, the odds worsen.   </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s more, Chinese trade links with foreign countries also raise the stakes. Take for instance, the Brazilian economy which is hugely (I would say entirely) dependent on imports and exports to China. If the USN starts sinking or seizing vessels full of Brazilian beef or Kenyan coffee or Saudi oil, the US will quickly lose international support in their war. </p></li>\n<li><p>Chinese demographics are not great. This is true. The US has the advantage of immigration, this is also true. But the consequences will take a <em>long</em> time to play out. By 2050, the US population will be about 350 million, slightly larger than it is today, but the average population age will be older than China&#39;s in 2050. In other words, the average Chinese will be younger than the average American, and the Chinese population will still be 3-4x the size of the US population. I would not say that is &quot;implosion&quot; in 20 years, I would say China is in the better demographic position in 20 years.</p>\n\n<p>By 2150, things will look far more in favor of the US, based on current trends, but 130 projects are hard to model, and the geopolitics of 2150 are impossible to apprehend today. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to this point, an &quot;advantage&quot; of authoritarians is that you can handle problems related to issues like demography in ways that democracies cannot. You can see Paris is on fire over a 2 year increase in the retirement age, a consequence of slowing/falling population growth. In China, these issues are not so difficult to resolve. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are some of many points that complicate any type of Chinese/US confrontation. Their relationship does not exist in a vacuum and China has built their entire military for the purpose of facing off with the US, while the US has built their military for a number of different purposes.</p>\n</div>",

The societal change between 2003 and now is simply too nebulous for, apparently, anyone to believe the US has come past it, as if we, today, are anything like Russia in terms of 'imperialism'. The national wild anger after 9/11, the disconnected intelligence services, and the incredible arrogance of being the sole remaining super power just aren't on the same level. Today politicians' votes in 2003 are relevant in our elections. Why? Because we know it was wrong. Did Russia learn after Georgia? No.\n\nDoes the US still have a ways to go to prove themselves and to be trusted? Yes, absolutely. My issue are the false equivalences.",

The US knows it fucked up badly with Iraq - but again, the goal was not comparable to literally trying to annex land and rule another country. This is an immense difference.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure people will bring up Iraq for the next 50 years despite no longer being relevant, quite frankly, in regard to current US policy.</p>\n\n<p>The US should have at least <em>attempted</em> to prosecute those responsible for Iraq, though. The societal change between 2003 and now is simply too nebulous for, apparently, anyone to believe the US has come past it, as if we, today, are anything like Russia in terms of &#39;imperialism&#39;. The national wild anger after 9/11, the disconnected intelligence services, and the incredible arrogance of being the sole remaining super power just aren&#39;t on the same level. Today politicians&#39; votes in 2003 are relevant in our elections. Why? Because we know it was wrong. Did Russia learn after Georgia? No.</p>\n\n<p>Does the US still have a ways to go to prove themselves and to be trusted? Yes, absolutely. My issue are the false equivalences.</p>\n</div>",

So, just like someone who runs for president (and wins) is expected to have a security detail for life, so do the judges. Any threats are therefore meaningless since it IS already part of the job.\n\n2) More likely than not, there are tacit agreements not to target other nationalities in other countries. This is why the assassinations carried out by Russia in foreign soil have exclusively targeted exiled Russians (someone correct me if I'm wrong). If you break this tacit agreement, you risk having strange things happening like Lavrov's cousin getting a sudden and debilitating disease, Kona's niece getting a strange case of botulism, etc...
