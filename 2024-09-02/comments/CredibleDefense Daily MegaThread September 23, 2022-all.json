It is a full third of the invasion force, and explains why the Russians can&#39;t attack (30% casualties is about where a unit is considered destroyed).</p>\n</div>",

Many, if not most of the vehicles actually had DNR/LNR dismounts, not Russian ones.</p>\n\n<pre><code>LNR/DNR don&#39;t operate\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is not a relevant point in this war, the units are mixed. Again, go look at POW interviews - you&#39;ll see many instances of mixed units, Russian officers leading DNR units and so on.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Yet another article discussing Putin's recently increased involvement in Russian strategic planning, this time including the specific claim that he rejected requests from his generals that they withdraw from Kherson city, as the southern front continues to look extremely shaky.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/us/politics/putin-ukraine.html\n\n>WASHINGTON \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has thrust himself more directly into strategic planning for the war in Ukraine in recent weeks, American officials said, including rejecting requests from his commanders on the ground that they be allowed to retreat from the vital southern city of Kherson.\n\n>A withdrawal from Kherson would allow the Russian military to pull back across the Dnipro River in an orderly way, preserving its equipment and saving the lives of soldiers.\n\n>But such a retreat would be another humiliating public acknowledgment of Mr. Putin\u2019s failure in the war, and would hand a second major victory to Ukraine in one month. Kherson was the first major city to fall to the Russians in the initial invasion, and remains the only regional capital under Moscow\u2019s control. Retaking it would be a major accomplishment for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.\n\n>Focused on victory at all costs, Mr. Putin has become a more public face of the war as the Russian military appears increasingly in turmoil, forcing him to announce a call-up this week that could sweep 300,000 Russian civilians into military service. This month, Moscow has demonstrated it has too few troops to continue its offensive, suffers from shortages of high-tech precision weaponry and has been unable to gain dominance of Ukraine\u2019s skies.\n\n>But American officials briefed on highly sensitive intelligence said that behind the scenes Mr. Putin is taking on an even deeper role in the war, including telling commanders that strategic decisions in the field are his to make. Although Mr. Putin has accepted some recommendations from military commanders, including the mobilization of civilians, his involvement has created tensions, American officials said.\n\n>The officials said that Mr. Putin\u2019s rejection of a military pullback from Kherson has also led to a decrease in morale among Russian troops who have been mostly cut off from their supply lines, and who appear to believe they could be left stranded against Ukrainian forces.\n\n>\u201cThe situation in Ukraine is clearly dynamic,\u201d Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for a full assessment, but it is clear to me that the strategic initiative has shifted to the Ukrainians.\u201d But he cautioned that there remains a \u201clong road ahead.\u201d\n\n>Mr. Putin\u2019s disagreements over battle lines in Kherson illustrate how critical the war in Ukraine\u2019s south is to both sides, American officials said. Despite Ukraine\u2019s recent advances in the northeast, the area around Kherson is a critical theater in the war, with profound strategic implications for Kyiv and Moscow.\n\n>Some American officials said they saw trouble ahead for the Russian military in the southern theater. A senior U.S. official said this week that Ukraine was well on its way to repeating in the south the gains its forces had managed during a lightning offensive in the northeast earlier this month. If Ukraine pushes Russian forces back farther, Mr. Putin\u2019s hard-fought-for land bridge to Crimea, the territory it captured from Ukraine and annexed in 2014, could eventually be threatened, American officials said.\n\n>The divisions over Kherson are only the latest disagreements between Mr. Putin and his top commanders. Senior Russian officers repeatedly questioned the early plans for the war, American officials said, particularly an initial stage that envisioned a quick strike on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. The Russian officers believed Mr. Putin was going to war with insufficient troops and weaponry, American officials said.\n\n>The Russian officers\u2019 concerns proved correct, and after the defeat of the Russian army outside Kyiv, Mr. Putin eased up his control of military planning. He allowed senior generals to create a new strategy focused on massive artillery barrages, American officials said. The new strategy was effectively a grinding war of attrition that played to the Russian military\u2019s strength and succeeded in pushing the army forward in eastern Ukraine.\n\n>Since Mr. Putin ordered his commanders to continue fighting in Kherson, the Russian military has tried to halt the Ukrainian advance there. Last week the Russians blew up a dam on the Inhulets River to make the current counteroffensive more difficult.\nBut Ukrainian strikes have blown up the crossings over the Dnipro River, which has largely cut off Russian troops from their supply lines on the other side. Russians have had to use pontoon bridges to cross the river, only to see them hit by Ukrainian fire, Ukrainian officials said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got units in there who, if the Ukrainians break through the lines, will be cut off and surrounded,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI cannot overstate how dicey the situation is for them.\u201d\n\n>Pulling back past the Dnipro River would likely allow Russian commanders to hold the line in the south with fewer troops. That would give them more latitude to redeploy forces from Kherson to other areas, either pushing back against the Kharkiv counteroffensive in the northeast, solidifying defensive lines in the eastern Donbas region or opening up a new front in the south.\n\n>But Mr. Putin has told commanders he will set the strategy.\n\n>\u201cIn this war there has been a consistent mismatch between Putin\u2019s political objectives and the military means to attain them,\u201d said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at CNA, a defense research institute in Arlington, Va. \u201cAt important decision points Putin has procrastinated, refusing to recognize the reality, until the options turned from bad to worse.\u201d\n\n>Pulling Russian forces back past the Dnipro River would also be a stark rebuttal to Mr. Putin\u2019s referendum there on joining the Russian Federation. Holding such sham votes is a key objective of Moscow. Blocking them remains one of Kyiv\u2019s top priorities.\n\n>With dissent rising in Russia, and military-age men attempting to flee the country to avoid the call-up, U.S. officials say Mr. Putin believes another Ukrainian victory would further erode the popularity of the war, something he cannot risk. Videos widely shared on Twitter in the days since Mr. Putin announced his call-up show angry draftees being scolded by shouting Russian military officials. \u201cPlaytime\u2019s over!\u201d yells one military official in one video. \u201cYou\u2019re soldiers now!\u201d\n\n>Mr. Putin\u2019s conversations with his regional military commanders in Ukraine may also be part of an effort to get more accurate assessments of the campaign. As the war has gone on, American officials have said that Mr. Putin has not been given accurate information from his top military advisers, Sergei K. Shoigu, the defense minister, and Valery Gerasimov, the Russian military\u2019s chief of the general staff.\n\n>In addition to blocking a retreat from Kherson, Mr. Putin has raised doubts about Russian efforts to consolidate their position in the northeast near the Oskil River, which the Ukrainian counteroffensive reached this month. Mr. Putin, an American official said, has opposed pulling back there as well, because he is reluctant to hand anything to Mr. Zelensky that looks like a win.\nEven as Mr. Putin demands a strategy of no further retreats, American officials said Russian officers themselves are divided on how to respond to the Ukrainian counteroffensives. Some officers believe they should push back hard on Mr. Putin\u2019s directives before the Ukrainians break through their current lines. Others believe they can follow through on Mr. Putin\u2019s directives.\n\n>Russia has continued to focus on the south, despite Ukrainian progress east of Kharkiv. While Moscow has sent some reinforcements to embattled northeastern positions, most of the tens of thousands of troops that Russia sent south to the Kherson area \u2014 including some of its best combat forces \u2014 remain in place.",

Familiar concepts, but different game. \n\nA huge reason why world war 2 was brutal was because you hit the niche of technology and cost where the most powerful army is the one that fielded the most men loaded with relatively inexpensive equipment. It took the world war 1 notion of large, cheap, conscript armies that were easy to field and combined that with industrial capacity. Mobilization then was still very much the main way to make a powerful army, because every great power in that war also had the necessary industrial capacity to equip those forces throughout the war, thus maintaining the idea of relatively cheap, huge militaries. In short, when Americans or Germans or Soviets sent a million men into battle, they paired that with tanks, planes, guns, etc, which all made these militaries very deadly. \n\n\nWhy is today different? For two main reasons, Russia cannot just throw a million men in and expect a world war 2 style of combat effectiveness. \n\n1. Military technology is more \"elite\" and \"specialized\" nowadays, making them cost prohibitive. I compare this to the medieval ascent of knights and horse archers. If you don't have either of these two, you're not going to win. Inversely, if you have either of these two, you've sunk a lot of cost into acquiring them. That means that for all powers, you're not going to see the scale of mass equipment like world war 2 because to be a relevant plane, or tank, you need to be extremely well built, but if you're extremely well built, you're also unsuitable to reproduce on a world war 2 level scale, at least for a country like Russia. In short, unlike the Soviet Union, Russia will not have the ability to equip their new million man army up to a similar standard as the beginning force, meaning that their combat power is significantly lower. \n\n2. Going down a cheaper path is likely impossible. The main reason why it's cost prohibitive is because modern equipment has a lot more hurdles to go through to stay relevant. If Russia starts pumping out 1950s tanks, or more simply pulls them from their remaining stocks, they're most likely going to fail one of those hurdles and be considerably easier to destroy on the battlefield. \n\n\nThe men coming in might take up some slack and fix a few problems for Russia such as notoriously thin front lines, but time is still on Ukraine's side because as long as the west backs Ukraine, they can field that modernized elite force increasingly so, since the west is far more capable of giving up to date relevant equipment to Ukraine than Russia is to their own soldiers, especially over time.",

The key technological driver was the atomic bomb, which both blocs started to seriously contend with in the mid-1950s. \n\nHowever Vietnam broke with American doctrine, instead of fighting a mechanized armored offensive these units were dismounted to fight like light infantry.

And to back it up with data: in 2016, per capita usage of alcohol in Russia ranked in the top 20 (#16) as the highest users of alcohol. As an addict myself, seeing all those drunkard men raises logistical and operational challenges for the Russian army. If we take it at face value that the newly mobilized men are addicts or about to become addicts, this leaves Russia in effect two options:\n\n1) Supply each man in the field with a daily vodka ration.\n\n2) Force all men to undergo rehab before being deployed and ban all alcohol consumption in the army.\n\nRussia has to pick one option; if you don't know, once you start consuming enough alcohol, you need to keep up a constant intake--every 24 hours. If you stop cold turkey, depending on the severity of the abuse, you will undergo withdrawal, which can be lethal if untreated. \n\nThe best long-term strategy would be to pick #2. Not only is it the moral, correct choice, but it would remove vodka from the essential logistics network. Supplying the front with gallons of liquor daily takes up physical space in trains and trucks, space that could be better used for clothes, ammunition, and other supplies.\n\nBut here's the challenge: does Russia have enough anti-convulsants to process 1.2 million men for a regimen of a 5 day detox program? You see, withdrawal is deadly, but with anti-convulsants or things like Ativan, it's quite manageable. In addition: how do you prevent relapse, especially in a wartime, stressful setting? Further, these men may not want treatment. Alcohol is a sweet thing, and morale may collapse to the point of mutiny if it were suddenly taken away.\n\nSo I think Russia will pick option 1 as the simplest solution. Of course, in the future, a HIMARs strike will destroy a Russian depot supplying one of their brigades. That brigade, depending on the daily vodka ration, will then suffer casualties--not from shelling or combat, but just from plain old alcohol withdrawal. And this will happen, again and again, all over the front until the war is over. The way to prevent this would be to include anti-convulsants with the vodka ration, as a backup in case supply gets disrupted. But this again would hamper supply: all that space for all that medicine is less space for other critical supplies.\n\nIt's a compounding series of tragedies, wrought by addiction and war.",

There's other pieces of evidence I have found because I've been actively searching. I am a former infantry NCO myself, training is very important to me because I know its value, so it's been something I've been trying to find out more about since the war started.\n\nThere are other types of training the UAF have done within Ukraine, including basic training, and lots of unit training opportunities for brigades in quiet sectors or in the strategic rear. Potentially much was better than the UK training, though much was probably worse too. However, not enough info has been released yet to get a good picture. Whatever they did have was never close to standardized in length, type, and quality.\n\nThat said, and especially in the March-July timeframe, it seems that the emphasis was to forgo training to get the maximum number of barely trained troops into combat ASAP so the UAF were strong enough to defend in strength in some areas while also being able to attack elsewhere in strength.

Potentially much was better than the UK training, though much was probably worse too. However, not enough info has been released yet to get a good picture. Whatever they did have was never close to standardized in length, type, and quality.</p>\n\n<p>That said, and especially in the March-July timeframe, it seems that the emphasis was to forgo training to get the maximum number of barely trained troops into combat ASAP so the UAF were strong enough to defend in strength in some areas while also being able to attack elsewhere in strength.

On the other hand, I&#39;m a scenario were nukes are his last ditch play, he likely simply won&#39;t have enough political capital left for what would literally be the biggest strategic gamble in human history. </p>\n\n<p>But hey, I&#39;m just a layman, maybe his top brass really is completely stupid and will obey any orders.</p>\n</div>",

The war impacted Soviet politics in four\nreinforcing ways: </p>\n\n<p>(1) Perception effects: it changed the perceptions of leaders about the\nefficacy of using the military to hold the empire together and to intervene in foreign countries;</p>\n\n<p>(2) Military effects: it discredited the Red Army, created cleavage between the party and the\nmilitary, and demonstrated that the Red Army was not invincible, which emboldened the non\nRussian republics to push for independence; </p>\n\n<p>(3) Legitimacy effects: it provided non-Russians\nwith a common cause to demand independence since they viewed this war as a Russian war\nfought by non Russians against Afghans; and </p>\n\n<p>(4) Participation effects: it created new forms of\npolitical participation, started to transform the press/media before glasnost, initiated the first\nshots of glasnost, and created a significant mass of war veterans (Afghansti) who formed new\ncivil organizations weakening the political hegemony of the communist party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

They're clearly not ideal for the Ukrainian situation, a smaller, less fuel hungry, and more simple tank would be better - but that doesn't exist. The Leopard 2 maybe meets some of those criteria, but it would take a real concerted European effort just to scrounge up enough tanks for a couple of Ukrainian armoured brigades - while the Leclerc and Challenger simply don't exist in anywhere near enough numbers.\n\nWith the Abrams on the other hand, you have thousands of tanks sat in storage, that will likely never see any sort of combat.

At this point you are presented with a first strike option involving the use of just under 1000 nuclear weapons to knock out Russia's nuclear sites accompanied by naval attacks on Russia's nuclear submarines. While the primary targets will be missile silos and weapons depots, many of these are located close to urban areas, and predicted casualties from the blast will be in the 5-10 million range, with a similar number of deaths expected due to fallout. You will instantly become the greatest mass-murderer in history. Moreover, this attack is unlikely to destroy every single deployable Russian ICBM, and the US can expect to face anything from 50 to 200 launches in retaliation. Cities such as New York, Washington DC, Chicago, and Los Angles will almost certainly be prime targets, along with London, Warsaw, and Kiev. Finally, you are warned that [recent studies have suggested even small-scale exchanges could potentially cause a nuclear winter](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2020/03/16/even-limited-india-pakistan-nuclear-war-would-bring-global-famine/) leading to devastating global famine.\n\nDo you think that you're really likely to give the go-ahead to the attack?\n\nPerhaps you prefer a smaller scale attack - perhaps targeting major Russian troop concentrations near the Ukrainian border. But what would that achieve? Russia is likely to respond in kind, targeting NATO bases in Europe. What happens next? Surely you have to escalate, prompting escalation in turn. This is why the idea of a small-scale nuclear war between superpowers remaining small-scale is generally considered unlikely.\n\nMy own view is that there is no effective Western response to the use of Russian weapons against NATO military sites. This is why NATO should probably refrain from direct involvement even in the event of a Russian nuclear strike on a Ukrainian target.\n\nOf course, Russian violation of the nuclear taboo could not go unpunished. The West's best response in such a situation, I would suggest, is one that does not provide Russia with a clear trigger to use nuclear weapons against NATO. However, the United States might attempt to convene an emergency meeting of the major world powers,  requesting an immediate and total cessation of all trade with Russia. India and China would be the key parties to convince, but the US has some powerful leverage. In the case of China, the US should say that if a total trade embargo is not enforced, then it will aid South Korea and Japan with immediate nuclearisation. In the case of India, US might be offer a transfer of Russia's permanent UNSC seat to India (breaking the nuclear taboo seems like the best justification for such a move that you're ever going to get). These diplomatic efforts could be supplemented by a policy of massive (covert, if necessary) ramping up of military aid to Ukraine, including kit like F-16s, Bradleys, and M1A2s.\n\nWhat if Russia used nuclear weapons again? This is where it gets even more difficult. In the event of a second use of nuclear weapons in anger, I think the US would have to get as many nations as possible - certainly Britain and France, maybe India and China too if it were at all possible - to commit to multi-lateral nuclear retaliation in the event of a third use. At this point in the imagined narrative, though, I recognise we're well into geopolitical thriller territory, so better to stop here.",

I think Ukraine views this war in historical terms - Russia has always behaved patronizingly and possessively towards Ukraine for hundreds of years, they're behaving that way now, and unless Ukraine can do something to fundamentally change the culture between the countries, Russia will be doing the same things in the future.

When their support ends, the war will end, because Ukraine can't afford to lose them. But they are all saying they will support Ukraine in those maximalist goals, and they are all benefiting from weakening Russia and the way this war is rallying previously fractured democracies together.

Germany also proposed to be included in the UN Security council, they need USA on their side.</p>\n\n<p>Most probable scenario are ATACMS/aircraft from USA, tanks from Europe. Plus Leopard 2 would put Germany in the spotlight as it&#39;s their design and their companies hold service/modernization IP. Economic benefit for German domestic industry is there as well.</p>\n</div>",

I understand the security issues, but the general consensus seems to be something much more questionable. </p>\n\n<p>This Lithuanian congressman, for example, twitted about it, saying Russians should stay and fight against Putin: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GLandsbergis/status/1573389737741918209?s=20&amp;t=k6NH3AK_R-gq1EJ49r9NqA\">https://twitter.com/GLandsbergis/status/1573389737741918209?s=20&amp;t=k6NH3AK_R-gq1EJ49r9NqA</a></p>\n\n<p>I really don&#39;t get the idea here. Everyone who escapes Russia is one less man Putin can send to the frontlines, not to mention the economic impact of a diaspora. It&#39;s also morally questionable to deny asylum to people fleeing forced conscription.</p>\n</div>",

But this of course is just that; fantasy. \n\n(No I'm not joking, 5 comments down there is a serious discussion in this thread about whether Germany is about to send 2000 leopards)\n\nRussia will find it very difficult to gain more ground in meaningful quantity.

But already, the weapons systems being donated are of lesser and lesser quality. No longer are M777s being sent over by the planeload. Instead, it&#39;s 50 year old 105mm systems. How can they expect to dislodge Russians who become more and more entrenched every day with these increasingly less capable systems? Kherson offensives continue to fail, and now 300k-1.2m more Russians are coming. Of dubious quality, sure, but 1.2m people can dig a lot of trenches and pour a lot of concrete. </p>\n\n<p>The fantasy seems to be that F-16s and thousands of modern battle tanks are coming over the horizon any day now.

ATACMS theoretically could change whether or not Ukraine is conducting a war to defend itself or whether or not NATO is waging a war against Russia. Presumably, the West does not want to escalate to avoid a direct conflict with Russia, but would escalate if they thought it would deter Russia from engaging in other bad behavior.\n\nWhy should the West escalate to deter or respond to Russian mobilization? The mobilization doesn't really change the nature of the conflict, other than that Putin is basically doubling down his bets on it.

It is far far too early to be making sweeping statements about the impact of mobilization on Putin&#39;s regime. We just have to see how it plays out.</p>\n</div>",

Yes, especially if it's in hard to get currency like USD or Euros. Russia also has oil infrastructure and plenty of things that Iran might like. The Iranian relationship with the west will probably not be affected at all by this, Iran arms groups far more volatile than Russia all the time. It's not like these sales tie Iran to Russia long term, I imagine that Russia also doesn't see itself relying on Iranian drones forever.
