        "body": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/20/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive-commanders-fighters.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur\n\nArticle from NYT on UAF troop morale during the counteroffensive, not massively deep on detail. \nIt's unlikely that UAF commanders are going to come out and say that Ukrainian morale is in the shitter and the troops are demoralised isn't it.  I haven't paid for NYT so I can't gift it unfortunately.\n\n**On the Front Line, Ukrainian Commanders Are Buoyed to Be on the Offensive**\n\n*Despite tough fighting and heavy casualties, Ukrainian commanders say their forces are in better shape now than just months ago, while Russian troops appear worse off.*\n\nIn 18 months of war, Ukrainian land has mostly changed hands in sudden bursts, with Russia snatching a mass of territory at the start and Ukraine recapturing chunks in dramatic counterattacks. Now 10 weeks into its most ambitious counteroffensive, with heavy casualties and equipment losses, questions have been growing about whether Ukraine can punch through Russian lines.\n\nDespite grueling fighting, Ukrainian forces along much of the 600-mile front are moving forward, and commanders and veteran soldiers say they are in better shape now than six or 12 months ago.\n\n\u201cIf a year ago we were conducting defensive operations and we had the task of holding back the enemy, now we have the ability to attack,\u201d Col. Dmytro Lysiuk, commander of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, said in an interview in his frontline bunker last week.\n\nUkrainian officers are almost invariably upbeat in interviews. Even if the counteroffensive has yielded only mixed results so far, with Ukrainian troops slowed by dense Russian minefields and sustained firepower, they describe previous periods as being tougher than this one.\n\nTheir optimism is tempered by the deepening realization that the war looks likely to continue at least a couple of years more. Some commanders even talk of a permanent state of conflict.\n\nBut Colonel Lysiuk and other leaders interviewed in recent weeks point to what they describe as a number of encouraging changes. Their units are better trained and equipped than ever, thanks to billions of dollars of Western aid.\n\nThey have worked out how to manage the training of fresh soldiers and how to keep replenishing their ranks after losses, even while continuing to fight. Almost every unit has grown in professionalism and size: Battalions have turned into brigades, and volunteer groups into formal army units.\n\nLonger-range Western artillery and, in particular, the cluster munitions recently provided by the United States, with some controversy, have been proving effective in destroying not only concentrations of Russian troops but also Russian armor and artillery systems.\n\nRussian reinforcements have been holding back, reluctant to move into range of Ukraine\u2019s guns, several commanders said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t approach closer, or they will be destroyed,\u201d said Lt. Ashot Arutiunian, the head of a drone unit of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army. Russia has resorted to other weapons, using more aviation bombs and missile strikes as a result, he said.\n\nHe showed video from his drones revealing damaged Russian armor. Vast craters gouged out of the earth by Russian aerial bombs and S300 missiles are visible in Ukrainian settlements all along the front line, where they have ripped up roads and smashed next to medical centers.\n\nEven if it does not recapture territory quickly, the counteroffensive signals a shift of perspective for Ukrainian fighters.\n\nFor more than a year, units like the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade were ordered to hold the line along the Zaporizhzhia front, often a grim task of defending trenches and fortified positions under constant bombardment. Colonel Lysiuk was charged with rebuilding the brigade after it had taken heavy losses and lost its commander in December. It was back on operations in a week.\n\n\u201cIt is tough,\u201d Colonel Lysiuk said, \u201cbut the system is already tested.\u201d\n\nIn June, his troops played a role in the first weeks of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, recapturing several villages in a strategic area near the Dnipro River and an intersection that leads south to the Black Sea and west to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nColonel Lysiuk declined to say what his main tasks were then, but he said the brigade had fulfilled them all. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you after the war,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a measure of how tough the fighting has been that the advance amounted to just a few miles. The Russians moved up reinforcements, he said, and assaults on the next village have failed.\n\nYet Colonel Lysiuk was unperturbed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a small job,\u201d he said. \u201cSome directions are more of a priority for development for a successful counteroffensive.\u201d\n\nMost of Ukraine\u2019s seasoned commanders said they had learned from previous counteroffensives that Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, chief of the armed forces, and his top generals were adept at subterfuge and feints.\n\nFor months last year, Ukraine talked up its counteroffensive in the southern Kherson region and then surprised the world, and many of its own troops, with a sudden breach of Russian lines in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.\n\nThe Kherson counteroffensive unfolded by destroying Russian supply routes, which eventually forced the Russians to retreat from territory west of the Dnipro.\n\nThe two successful campaigns have given many Ukrainian soldiers and officers on the front confidence in General Zaluzhny\u2019s overarching plan, even when troops receive a mauling, as did the new brigades spearheading the counteroffensive.\n\n\u201cWe were disappointed, we thought they would punch quickly through to the sea,\u201d said a 30-year-old deputy battalion commander of the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade, fighting on the eastern front. He gave only his call sign, Tysen, according to military protocol.\n\nBut Tysen said he had friends fighting in the south and they remained confident.\n\n\u201cTactically, with cunning, with Western equipment, the Ukrainian armed forces are breaking through their defenses,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccess is just a question of time.\u201d\n\nRussian forces have mounted a fresh offensive in northeastern Ukraine toward the city of Kupiansk, but Ukraine units say they have managed to hold them at bay.\n\nTysen and other commanders said that the Russian forces they saw appeared to be in poorer shape than the Ukrainian ones.\n\n\u201cCompared to the beginning of the war, their equipment and personnel are in a very sorry state,\u201d Tysen said.\n\nOn the southern front, soldiers and commanders said there were signs that Ukrainian artillery was wearing down Russian units facing them, largely thanks to American cluster munitions.\n\n\u201cWe are using them quite effectively,\u201d Colonel Lysiuk said. \u201cThey arrived mid-July. And we use them constantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe destroyed a lot of the enemy\u2019s artillery in this time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf before 20 enemy guns were working, now it\u2019s two to four.\u201d There are also signs, he said, that the Russians \u201ccannot maintain constant combat readiness.\u201d\n\nTactics mattered, too, said a deputy battalion commander of 129th Territorial Defense Brigade, who goes by the call sign Kherson.\n\nA 41-year-old former government administrator who enlisted after the Russian invasion last year, Kherson led his unit in a combined assault on the village of Neskuchne at the beginning of the counteroffensive.\n\nHis men gained a foothold in the village and battled at close quarters for three days, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Russians attempted counterattacks, tried to squeeze us out, to encircle us but everything happened as we envisioned,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also had strong support from artillery and the higher command.\u201d\n\nAs the Russian troops began to retreat, Russian forces fired rockets at the battlefield, killing their own men.\n\n\u201cThey buried quite a lot of their own guys,\u201d Kherson said.\n\nMost Ukrainian commanders said their leaders had shown far more concern for the lives of their men than the Russian command for its troops. A few said hesitancy sometimes actually cost more Ukrainian lives.\n\nA special operations forces officer, Oleksii, whose unit lost 15 men in four days of failed assaults on one village at the start of the counteroffensive, said, \u201cIf we had had harsher orders, that we had no option, we had to take the village, we would have.\u201d\n\nInstead, commanders delayed the operation, giving the Russians time to mine the trenches, he said. Then, when the first assault ran into difficulty, the commanders pulled back to regroup instead of sending in reinforcements.\n\n\u201cIf you did it in one push, you would succeed and lose less people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey thought, \u2018we will try and lose less people,\u2019 and now almost our whole group is in the hospital.\u201d\n\nHow long such losses can be sustained by both sides may now prove critical to the war\u2019s future course. Russia can draw from a population more than three times as large, but Ukrainian commanders repeatedly pointed to a crucial difference between the two sides: They were fighting to save their country.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long it is,\u201d Kherson said. \u201cIt would be great if it ends in a week. If it is longer \u2014 we don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d",

As some background, I have had some time in Block 30/40/50 F-16s and while it wasn't my main operational aircraft by any means, I've had to learn on them and seen them in various exercises both US and Allied ones:\n\n* The F-16A MLUs did get a lot of updates to bring it closer to the Block 50 standard (mainly the Modular Mission Computer, or MMC) but people mistake that to mean it is a Block 50. It is not - for one, they don't have the big inlets + big motors, they're still stuck with the old P&W -220 engines. So they got additional weight from new + additional hardware without the big motors that make the F-16 the rocket it is known as\n* Funny enough, the Block 50's are not actually the best F-16s in the US inventory. The ANG/AFR have kept their Block 30's F-16s in better shape - you'll note that it is Guard and Reserve F-16s that have gotten the AESA upgrades and CDU (Center Display Unit... the third display), whereas CAF F-16s are considered inferior. Lots of background on that one, including how we budget and do acquisitions, but if you asked anyone in the USAF today which F-16 variant they have that is the best of them, it's not the Block 50's\n* The F-16 Block 25/30/32s of the ANG/AFR have a different mission computer software line entirely - they used different computers from the MMCs of the MLU/40/42/50/52 line, and have had more updates than the MMC line\n* A big part of this is that the CAF neglected updating a lot of their F-16s until relatively recently. F-35 wasn't delivered on time as promised, GWOT soaked up time/attention, and lots of uncertainty on the future of the F-16 meant minimal updates/upgrades over the past decade - at least compared to other airframes. That translates to a lot of neglected areas from like defensive EW systems - [stuff which is only now getting attention for the US](https://theaviationist.com/2023/06/07/f-16s-next-generation-electronic-warfare-suite/), let alone being sent to a non-NATO nation\n* To add to this, the FMS partners on the F-16 that got the MLU upgrades did so over the course of the 2000's. Whether they paid for/got more recent MMC versions is up for debate, to say nothing about other hardware/software updates (buying an aircraft doesn't give you a lifetime of updates... you've got to pay to play)\n* I don't know specifically what Denmark and the Dutch have on their jets, but a lot of what keeps the F-16 even remotely relevant - things like the latest targeting pods, HTS, etc. - aren't universal on all operators. In addition, a lot of that stuff isn't easily exportable - just like the DOD took custody of the RAAF F-18s and prevented their sale to private contractors, that stuff doesn't just go free to whoever gets these jets\n* Speaking of combat capability, the F-16 has never been known for its radar, least of all upgraded variants of its original radar, the APG-66. Again, I think people are significantly overstating the relevance of this fighter, especially when it won't have access to all the other assets the US fights with (other aircraft, airborne C2 platforms, etc.)\n* On the weapons front, keep in mind that the weapons that are compatible with the F-35 (like the AIM-120) are probably not being handed out. Maybe older variants of the AIM-120, but these nations with shoestring defense budgets aren't giving all the accompanying weapons they have if they can be used in their F-35 fleets. Maybe older variants of AIM-9s and AIM-120s, but again, see argument on relevance\n* The other part that no one here is even remotely thinking of is the wide gulf between Ukraine's Air Force - which still has a lot of Soviet-doctrine - with western Air Forces. To say nothing about Western tactics and the fact that they are very divergent. There are major fundamental differences in everything from flight leadership to command and control. We've already seen issues with Ukraines Armed Forces seemingly reverting to Soviet-style leadership at critical levels during this offensive - what do you think a bunch of pilots with years flying MiGs and Flankers using Soviet-style doctrine will do?\n* Also, how much is the US authorizing to give in terms of classified technical data on weapons? I'm sure you've heard many pilots talk about how we study a LOT - it's tactics and technical details on how we employ our weapons that eat up a lot of our time studying. It's one thing to give up HARM with limited modes from the 1980s when we have a lot of other SEAD weapons, it's another to give up all of our details on AIM-120s still in frontline service - and our primary missile operationally in service. Remember, and I hate to say it, but we stand to lose a LOT if that stuff gets out, and that's what's being balanced when we decide what we give to Ukraine. To say nothing about Ukraine then using them proficiently with what stockpile they get, if any, especially given the US looking to rebuild its stockpiles right now.\n* (Whole 'nother discussion on this, but all of the above are reasons the F-18s were never on the table for Ukraine - the RAAF F-18s were handed back to the US and to the RCAF, both of whom are still operating them and upgrading them with the APG-79(V)4, and for once the USMC is fat on spare parts for its F-18 fleet. Meanwhile, the F-16s have always been considered more expendable.... again, this is a whole 'nother topic on its own)\n* The proficiency piece is another aspect. Those articles about how Ukrainian pilots could be trained in 4 months gave zero context on what they were trained to - and from what I recall, it was basic flying and basic A/S fundamentals. For the record, a US pilot with other fighter experience can get their basic F-16 qual to fly the aircraft within a month. Being tactically proficient, a US pilot with other fighter experience (and thus already knows our systems, doctrinal and tactics basis) can be at least a wingman level within 3 months. The full normal F-16 course for guys and gals straight out of UPT is closer to a year - with multiple years (2-3 years) afterwards to get your flight lead upgrades and to be remotely considered proficient as an F-16 pilot.\n* (I'll also add that a lot of people argue that Ukraine knows best, and they said they want F-16s... but really, they don't know squat when it comes to Western air power. Ukraine is a non-NATO nation that has only recently had any exposure to exercises with Western forces, and even then, that stuff is limited. Watching them repeat memes of the A-10 and then wanting F-16s, then recent talks about the Typhoon and Rafale being below that, really shows how little they actually know which fighter is more relevant against Russian air power. But I digress)\n\nI could go on and on about this. That's not to say that the Ukrainians won't, again, find ways to be innovative or to help plug gaps in their own air defenses. And that they won't find some ways to generate propaganda wins (remember the Ghost of Kyiv?) before Russian forces adapt. But I really beg people to think more deeply and take into consideration of all the other factors that make a fighter platform useful, and why no one in the know is thinking of this as some game changer - and plenty of others think this has a lot of cons for the US, from both technical stuff being compromised to the impact on morale if they start losing them in quantities\n\nedit: typos",

They can't afford any attrition at all, and they can't launch mass strikes against targets of importance even if they want to.\n\n>I'd be quite a bit more concerned with them burning through those missiles at rates the West can't sustain.\n\nAnd with F-16 they can use JSOW, SLAM-ER, SDB, etc. So they're not stuck using JDAMs and cruise missiles only.\n\n>And if we've learned anything in this war, it's that Russia eventually does adapt, even if it takes a bit\n\nVery few of the adaptations are as efficient as the original options.

As a layman I\u2019m having a hard time connecting what a weaker engine means to its impact on missions etc etc.\n\nRegarding engines, the original F-16 was designed as a lightweight WVR-only fighter which used its superior thrust to weight ratio to beat the hordes of MiG-21s it was expected to fight - all done in BFM (dogfighting, in layman's terms). In BFM, T/W is a major factor \n\nWhen it first came out in the late 70s/early 80s, its T/W was superior to 3rd generation fighters, so it would have easily spanked them. As time has moved on however, and the Soviets came out with the Fulcrum and Flanker class, the F-16s have had multiple engine upgrades (+ big inlet modifications to increase thrust) to improve its T/W, so that its WVR/BFM capability was still a strong point\n\nIf you're not going to be a great BVR fighter, then at least be a good WVR fighter. In this case, the F-16A MLUs aren't particularly good at either\n\nAs to what missions they can fly? All of the above points I wrote can impact any of those missions. A lack of understanding of how the AIM-120 works may result in a low probability of kill (and waste a lot of finite missiles) and may even get you killed, if you thought you were in a good position to shoot but are actually about to eat a missile in the face because you didn't understand BVR tactics properly\n\nedit: I'll add that the MLUs, IIRC, have a pretty paltry max takeoff weight, which means less fuel/endurance from external tanks or less payload for heavier weapons like potential cruise missiles. It also means that with actual stores on, they'll struggle with getting higher/faster, which is a must if you're dropping glide weapons\n\n>I was under the impression that Ukraine would just use them mostly to shoot down missiles headed towards cities behind the front line, considering their ground based AA was running low on ammunition. Are these points dealbreakers (or at least major limiters) for that?\n\nI don't know why you're worried if its a dealbreaker or not. There's a saying that a lot is possible in war - it just depends on how many people/aircraft/systems you want to lose/waste and how much failure you can tolerate. And no, I wouldn't want my air defenses to rely on a mechanically scanned radar that has never been considered good to look for missiles",

To what extent could they attempt SEAD without having the rest of the moving pieces?\n\nThe biggest things I can think of is having some asymmetric options that force Russia to focus attention elsewhere and in areas they haven't had to worry too much about (like air defense). Such as, more aircraft that can feint attacks that force Russia to focus on an area away from where actual strikes are coming from. Combine that with unconventional systems like their small drone attacks, and it complicates Russian air defenses - or forces them to be on longer, stretching their manpower and logistics. Defensively, it also forces Russia to have to consider which vectors it can strike from, whether it needs to send more missiles, etc., all of which complicate strike planning\n\nI don't personally see it as some major shift in how they will fight - ultimately, we in the US wouldn't even want to go in to do SEAD with any one of our platforms without a lot of supporting assets and a much better ISR complex than what Ukraine has. But that doesn't mean Ukraine can't make it harder to defend against their attacks, and make it harder for the Russians to adapt to when they try novel asymmetric attacks",
