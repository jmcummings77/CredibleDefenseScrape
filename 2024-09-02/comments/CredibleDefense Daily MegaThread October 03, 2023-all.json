        "body": "A while back, in one of those \"I'm only inviting debate and asking questions\" posts from our former resident United Russia apologist, I expressed a certain, uh, disdain for Stephen Walt's academic work. I didn't go into too much detail then because I didn't want to take the flame bait, but based on what I saw in that topic and in other threads debating their recent work, I think some of our younger audience might find a trip down the memory lane interesting. \n\nI think the current position of Walt and his frequent co-author, Mearsheimer, are firmly grounded not only in their (I must emphasise, not just perfectly legitimate, but extremely valuable) academic work on the theory of international relations, but also in a number of less fortunate positions they took during their mid/late-career period, which have affected their standing among peers from their own schools of realist IR.\n\nThey are not alone in this, all historians and political scientists find themselves haunted by poor predictions or bad allegiances. And, more importantly, I don't think they take these positions for strictly *personal* reasons or because they're \"Russian assets\", as I've sometimes seen them characterized. Rather, I think some of their particularly bad takes and some of their underlying political convictions have informed a very particular interpretation, based on a very selective take of history, that confirms some important points of their theories. This is how political science works. It's not an exact science, and while it often feels weird to people with a more STEM-y background like yours truly, its state of the art is advanced through hot takes, too.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is well-acquainted with the difficult post-Cold War international relations between Russia and Ukraine. Back in 1993, before the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, he published a widely-read essay about Ukraine's deterrence options, *The Case for a Ukrainian Nuclear Deterrent*, in which he argued that Ukraine was unlikely to renounce its nuclear arsenal, as it needed a deterrent against possible Russian aggression. That particular prediction lasted for all of two years, but it was actually based on a number of very accurate observations. He noted that:\n\n* There is a long, bitter enmity between Ukraine and Russia, based on two centuries of Russian aggressive occupation and genocide\n* There is a real prospect that Russian-Ukrainian relations might deteriorate in the future\n* That immediate Russian policy and security interests relied on maintaining control over their immediate smaller neighbours\n* That a war between Russia and Ukraine would cause massive destruction and suffering, and would likely involve signficant concerns about the (at the time) 14 civilian nuclear reactors in Ukraine. (This was partly anchored in his older studies about the potential for a Soviet attack in Europe, which he considered unlikely, as he thought the Soviet army would not be able to conduct a fast and decisive attack, and that it recognised this inability)\n* That maintaining a nuclear detterent in Ukraine is likely to cause anger and distress in Russia, but that it would be an efficient deterrent, at least in the short term, as the cost of a preventive Russian attack would be too high\n* That there are many Russians living in Ukraine and vice-versa, and that abuse of one of these minorities by the majority could trigger a crisis\n* That extending the NATO security umbrella on former Soviet territories was going to anger Russian strategists\n\nThis was not a popular take in an age where everyone pushed for non-proliferation. Mearsheimer is seen as a contrarian, anti-establishment commentator *now* but back then there was no shortage of people calling him a neocon, as he was, literally, advocating for developing nuclear deterrence in Europe, not just by having Ukraine keep its arsenal, but also by encouraging Germany to develop its own.\n\nHowever, most of Mearsheimer's actual policy predictions aged about as well as milk:\n\n1. He argued that encouraging European countries to maintain (Ukraine) or develop (Germany) nuclear deterrents was essential, because the power of NATO was dwindling and its presence in Europe was as good as gone. Much of his essay, in fact, is built on the premise that Russian and American troops would soon leave Europe, neither of which happened.\n2. He believed Ukraine needed a nuclear deterrent because Ukraine would not be able to develop a military that could stop a Russian attack, as Russia was simply too powerful.\n3. He believed security guarantees from the West were theoretically possible, but impractical. Extending deterrence to Germany during the Cold War had already been expensive, but he thought extending it to Ukraine was impossible, as Europe didn't want to take on an expensive new ally and NATO power was shrinking rapidly.\n\nUltimately, his views on the future of US - Russian relations came to be viewed rather unfavourably. The 2014 invasion vindicated much of the background of his essay, but not the actual policy recommendations: it was not at all clear how Ukraine could have credibly used its aging nuclear arsenal to deter the 2014 invasion, Russia did not turn out to be \"simply too powerful\" to contain, and NATO definitely didn't shrink.\n\nBut most importantly, both because it was a product of its times and because it was based on strictly offensive realist view that excluded the personal convictions of leaders, Mearsheimer's predictions missed two critical points:\n\n1. That European countries, despite their political differences, *would* recognise Russian threat, and would in fact rally to help block Russian expansion if it showed any signs of being a feasible strategy.\n2. That the agendas of world leaders *do* in fact play a role in the shaping of foreign policy; specifically, in this case, that Putin could not allow a realignment of Ukraine without endangering his regime, which caused Russia to take an unusually aggressive stance (e.g. energy sanctions) even well before 2010 against a nominal ally, and ultimately adopt a heavy-handed policy of involvement in Ukrainian domestic policy that eventually catapulted Ukraine off its orbit.\n\nThe latter point was particularly critical to his theory, and the Russian party line of a \"nationalist coup\" turned out to be a convenient way out, as it preserved both the soundness of his grand theory (security competition of state actors in a fundamentally anarchic environment) and made his 20 year-old prophecy about ethnic conflict in Ukraine, which would've been avoided if only anyone had listened to him, suddenly sound good.\n\nAn \"amortised\" version of this take is not without merit. It would be impossible to understand the dynamics of Ukrainian policy without acknowledging the contribution of both moderate and extreme nationalist forces, and while Putin's own domestic agenda and historical views shape Russian policy, its shape is not divorced from historical Russian and Soviet foreign policy.\n\nHowever, in order to salvage the \"hardline\" form of what, by now, is IMHO an obsolete understanding of offensive realism, Mearsheimer has to ignore the form of Russia's post-Soviet Ukrainian policy:\n\n1. The gradual pro-European re-alignment of Ukrainian society which *did not* immediately take an anti-Russian form (in fact, during the early 00s crises, during the Maidan protests, and even as far recently as the eve of the Russian invasion, Ukraine had a steady but clearly minoritary anti-Russian view: months before Maidan, only 4% of Ukrainians viewed Russia as an enemy ([1](https://archive.ph/20130620225058/http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/32-of-ukrainians-call-russia-brotherly-country-poll-2/)), despite their significantly higher pro-European orientation).\n2. Russia's difficulty of asserting domination in its immediate space through means other than force.\n3. Russia's significant involvement in pre-2014 Ukrainian policy, and\n4. The gradual breakdown of Russian security guarantees, and of the international framework of bilateral (and multilateral) treaties, some of which Putin himself signed.\n\nDoing otherwise would suggest things that are absolute heresy in the strict form of Mearsheimer's theory: that national and even contingent political values, and the human nature of statesmen and citizens alike, shape foreign policy even to the point of occasionally outweighing strictly rationalist decisions; that international institutions and treaties can provide a stable framework of cooperation among partners who recognise mutual national interest; or that states can seek greater power or domination for reasons other than legitimate security interests -- such as the economic interests of high-placed politicians, campaign agendas and so on.\n\nI think I'm nearing the 10,000 character limit so I'm going to stop this here, let me see how much more Reddit will let me type.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A while back, in one of those &quot;I&#39;m only inviting debate and asking questions&quot; posts from our former resident United Russia apologist, I expressed a certain, uh, disdain for Stephen Walt&#39;s academic work. I didn&#39;t go into too much detail then because I didn&#39;t want to take the flame bait, but based on what I saw in that topic and in other threads debating their recent work, I think some of our younger audience might find a trip down the memory lane interesting. </p>\n\n<p>I think the current position of Walt and his frequent co-author, Mearsheimer, are firmly grounded not only in their (I must emphasise, not just perfectly legitimate, but extremely valuable) academic work on the theory of international relations, but also in a number of less fortunate positions they took during their mid/late-career period, which have affected their standing among peers from their own schools of realist IR.</p>\n\n<p>They are not alone in this, all historians and political scientists find themselves haunted by poor predictions or bad allegiances. And, more importantly, I don&#39;t think they take these positions for strictly <em>personal</em> reasons or because they&#39;re &quot;Russian assets&quot;, as I&#39;ve sometimes seen them characterized. Rather, I think some of their particularly bad takes and some of their underlying political convictions have informed a very particular interpretation, based on a very selective take of history, that confirms some important points of their theories. This is how political science works. It&#39;s not an exact science, and while it often feels weird to people with a more STEM-y background like yours truly, its state of the art is advanced through hot takes, too.</p>\n\n<p>John Mearsheimer is well-acquainted with the difficult post-Cold War international relations between Russia and Ukraine. Back in 1993, before the signing of the Budapest Memorandum, he published a widely-read essay about Ukraine&#39;s deterrence options, <em>The Case for a Ukrainian Nuclear Deterrent</em>, in which he argued that Ukraine was unlikely to renounce its nuclear arsenal, as it needed a deterrent against possible Russian aggression. That particular prediction lasted for all of two years, but it was actually based on a number of very accurate observations. He noted that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a long, bitter enmity between Ukraine and Russia, based on two centuries of Russian aggressive occupation and genocide</li>\n<li>There is a real prospect that Russian-Ukrainian relations might deteriorate in the future</li>\n<li>That immediate Russian policy and security interests relied on maintaining control over their immediate smaller neighbours</li>\n<li>That a war between Russia and Ukraine would cause massive destruction and suffering, and would likely involve signficant concerns about the (at the time) 14 civilian nuclear reactors in Ukraine. (This was partly anchored in his older studies about the potential for a Soviet attack in Europe, which he considered unlikely, as he thought the Soviet army would not be able to conduct a fast and decisive attack, and that it recognised this inability)</li>\n<li>That maintaining a nuclear detterent in Ukraine is likely to cause anger and distress in Russia, but that it would be an efficient deterrent, at least in the short term, as the cost of a preventive Russian attack would be too high</li>\n<li>That there are many Russians living in Ukraine and vice-versa, and that abuse of one of these minorities by the majority could trigger a crisis</li>\n<li>That extending the NATO security umbrella on former Soviet territories was going to anger Russian strategists</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This was not a popular take in an age where everyone pushed for non-proliferation. Mearsheimer is seen as a contrarian, anti-establishment commentator <em>now</em> but back then there was no shortage of people calling him a neocon, as he was, literally, advocating for developing nuclear deterrence in Europe, not just by having Ukraine keep its arsenal, but also by encouraging Germany to develop its own.</p>\n\n<p>However, most of Mearsheimer&#39;s actual policy predictions aged about as well as milk:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>He argued that encouraging European countries to maintain (Ukraine) or develop (Germany) nuclear deterrents was essential, because the power of NATO was dwindling and its presence in Europe was as good as gone. Much of his essay, in fact, is built on the premise that Russian and American troops would soon leave Europe, neither of which happened.</li>\n<li>He believed Ukraine needed a nuclear deterrent because Ukraine would not be able to develop a military that could stop a Russian attack, as Russia was simply too powerful.</li>\n<li>He believed security guarantees from the West were theoretically possible, but impractical. Extending deterrence to Germany during the Cold War had already been expensive, but he thought extending it to Ukraine was impossible, as Europe didn&#39;t want to take on an expensive new ally and NATO power was shrinking rapidly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ultimately, his views on the future of US - Russian relations came to be viewed rather unfavourably. The 2014 invasion vindicated much of the background of his essay, but not the actual policy recommendations: it was not at all clear how Ukraine could have credibly used its aging nuclear arsenal to deter the 2014 invasion, Russia did not turn out to be &quot;simply too powerful&quot; to contain, and NATO definitely didn&#39;t shrink.</p>\n\n<p>But most importantly, both because it was a product of its times and because it was based on strictly offensive realist view that excluded the personal convictions of leaders, Mearsheimer&#39;s predictions missed two critical points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>That European countries, despite their political differences, <em>would</em> recognise Russian threat, and would in fact rally to help block Russian expansion if it showed any signs of being a feasible strategy.</li>\n<li>That the agendas of world leaders <em>do</em> in fact play a role in the shaping of foreign policy; specifically, in this case, that Putin could not allow a realignment of Ukraine without endangering his regime, which caused Russia to take an unusually aggressive stance (e.g. energy sanctions) even well before 2010 against a nominal ally, and ultimately adopt a heavy-handed policy of involvement in Ukrainian domestic policy that eventually catapulted Ukraine off its orbit.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The latter point was particularly critical to his theory, and the Russian party line of a &quot;nationalist coup&quot; turned out to be a convenient way out, as it preserved both the soundness of his grand theory (security competition of state actors in a fundamentally anarchic environment) and made his 20 year-old prophecy about ethnic conflict in Ukraine, which would&#39;ve been avoided if only anyone had listened to him, suddenly sound good.</p>\n\n<p>An &quot;amortised&quot; version of this take is not without merit. It would be impossible to understand the dynamics of Ukrainian policy without acknowledging the contribution of both moderate and extreme nationalist forces, and while Putin&#39;s own domestic agenda and historical views shape Russian policy, its shape is not divorced from historical Russian and Soviet foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p>However, in order to salvage the &quot;hardline&quot; form of what, by now, is IMHO an obsolete understanding of offensive realism, Mearsheimer has to ignore the form of Russia&#39;s post-Soviet Ukrainian policy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The gradual pro-European re-alignment of Ukrainian society which <em>did not</em> immediately take an anti-Russian form (in fact, during the early 00s crises, during the Maidan protests, and even as far recently as the eve of the Russian invasion, Ukraine had a steady but clearly minoritary anti-Russian view: months before Maidan, only 4% of Ukrainians viewed Russia as an enemy (<a href=\"https://archive.ph/20130620225058/http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/32-of-ukrainians-call-russia-brotherly-country-poll-2/\">1</a>), despite their significantly higher pro-European orientation).</li>\n<li>Russia&#39;s difficulty of asserting domination in its immediate space through means other than force.</li>\n<li>Russia&#39;s significant involvement in pre-2014 Ukrainian policy, and</li>\n<li>The gradual breakdown of Russian security guarantees, and of the international framework of bilateral (and multilateral) treaties, some of which Putin himself signed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Doing otherwise would suggest things that are absolute heresy in the strict form of Mearsheimer&#39;s theory: that national and even contingent political values, and the human nature of statesmen and citizens alike, shape foreign policy even to the point of occasionally outweighing strictly rationalist decisions; that international institutions and treaties can provide a stable framework of cooperation among partners who recognise mutual national interest; or that states can seek greater power or domination for reasons other than legitimate security interests -- such as the economic interests of high-placed politicians, campaign agendas and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I think I&#39;m nearing the 10,000 character limit so I&#39;m going to stop this here, let me see how much more Reddit will let me type.</p>\n</div>",

That's why, in my previous post, I alluded to the fact that reading Haushofer's works offers a good key to understanding Walt's works, as Haushoffer, too, grappled with a real difficulty of reconciling his attempts to develop a rational theory of history and international relations with a curious and contradictory personal conviction of anti-semitism.\n\nNow, one doesn't get to be the Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of International Relations by openly stating anti-Semitic theories, so I have zero proof of this.

It portrayed the Western understanding of Russian policy as blinded by an incorrect assessment of them being about blind territorial greed, rather than Russian security concerns, which to a contemporary observer was a blatant (and, but heed my bias disclaimer, tankie-looking) carricature of Russian approach. It *was* about Russian security concerns, yes; and not about blind territorial greed, no; but it left out the part where it was very much about *political* control. It portrayed the Russian approach to Ukraine in about the same terms that the Soviet approach to Czechoslovakia was once portrayed.

Why Russia would renounce a claim to the politically-subservient status it had sought to enforce in Ukraine post-Kuchma, in favour of a weaker claim that was significantly more difficult to enforce\n2. Why signing binding international treaties with a power that had broken virtually all of them in order to stake a claim on Crimea and the Donbas would fare any better for the rest of Ukraine\n3. Why the EU and the US should treat Russian security concerns as any more important than Ukrainian security concerns\n\nHis contradictory points simply made Walt's theories less popular, or rather more difficult to debate in good faith, than they deserved.

                "body": "No, no, not at all.\n\nIt's a little difficult to explain this entirely without referencing the yet *older* system that structuralist theories ~~replaced~~ (edit:) or rather developed upon. Classical realist theories were overwhelmingly based on the view that there are objective, though possibly indiscernible laws, that have their roots in human nature, and which shape the dynamics of international relations (and political relations in general). This sounds like a far less dramatic shift than it actually was: in noting this, Hans Morgenthau, the father of political realism, effectively noted that whatever one nation may view as \"moral\" or \"just\" are not universal values. The latter may be forms in which what is desirable for the power of interests of a nation is sometimes portrayed, but it holds no universal status.\n\nMearsheimer's views belong to a wider current called structural realism, which seeks to explain international relations through the lens of structural constraints of the international world. Structuralist theorists emphasise the role of states, rather than statesmen, and seek to model the dynamics of international relations through objective laws about the behaviour and nature of state actors, rather than human nature.\n\nThis, too, sounds less like the progress that it was. For instance, classical realist theories grappled with a wide range of problems. It sought to explain dynamics based on an ideal of \"balance of power\", which neatly fit our ideas of human nature, but didn't really stand to historical scrutiny, and which structuralists (most prominently, Stephen Walt) developed into a more flexible system based on a balance of *threat*.\n\nHowever, in order for this system to work at all, it needs to treat states as independent actors that react and work based on purely state-level factors. This is a necessary limitation of the model. Structuralist models do not *deny* the influence of presidents or other statesmen, that wouldn't be just wild, it would be obviously naive. However, they emphasise the role that they play in the pursuit of their states' foreign policies, rather than the role that they play in *shaping* their states' foreign policies.\n\nThis is not a wrong way to look at things, or in any case, not any more wrong than other realist schools. Like any model, it's incomplete, but it's not a failure of this theory.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>No, no, not at all.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a little difficult to explain this entirely without referencing the yet <em>older</em> system that structuralist theories <del>replaced</del> (edit:) or rather developed upon. Classical realist theories were overwhelmingly based on the view that there are objective, though possibly indiscernible laws, that have their roots in human nature, and which shape the dynamics of international relations (and political relations in general). This sounds like a far less dramatic shift than it actually was: in noting this, Hans Morgenthau, the father of political realism, effectively noted that whatever one nation may view as &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;just&quot; are not universal values. The latter may be forms in which what is desirable for the power of interests of a nation is sometimes portrayed, but it holds no universal status.</p>\n\n<p>Mearsheimer&#39;s views belong to a wider current called structural realism, which seeks to explain international relations through the lens of structural constraints of the international world. Structuralist theorists emphasise the role of states, rather than statesmen, and seek to model the dynamics of international relations through objective laws about the behaviour and nature of state actors, rather than human nature.</p>\n\n<p>This, too, sounds less like the progress that it was. For instance, classical realist theories grappled with a wide range of problems. It sought to explain dynamics based on an ideal of &quot;balance of power&quot;, which neatly fit our ideas of human nature, but didn&#39;t really stand to historical scrutiny, and which structuralists (most prominently, Stephen Walt) developed into a more flexible system based on a balance of <em>threat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, in order for this system to work at all, it needs to treat states as independent actors that react and work based on purely state-level factors. This is a necessary limitation of the model. Structuralist models do not <em>deny</em> the influence of presidents or other statesmen, that wouldn&#39;t be just wild, it would be obviously naive. However, they emphasise the role that they play in the pursuit of their states&#39; foreign policies, rather than the role that they play in <em>shaping</em> their states&#39; foreign policies.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a wrong way to look at things, or in any case, not any more wrong than other realist schools. Like any model, it&#39;s incomplete, but it&#39;s not a failure of this theory. Particularly orthodox structuralist models, like Mearsheimer&#39;s, can only factor these things in to a limited degree, because they have no theory of &quot;mixed&quot; interactions. (Edit: to one-up this, this is not an case of dishonesty, it&#39;s a real case of academic integrity.

That's why he makes a case for a Ukrainian nuclear deterrent in the first place, as the title of his essay forebodes. In fact, he states them, in a condensed form, in the introduction:\n\n> A nuclear Ukraine makes sense for two reasons. First, it is imperative to maintain peace between Russia and Ukraine. That means ensuring that the Russians, who have a history of bad relations with Ukraine, do not move to reconquer it. Ukraine cannot defend itself against a nuclear-armed Russia with conventional weapons, and no state, including the United States, is going to extend to it a meaningful security guarantee. Ukrainian nuclear weapons are the only reliable deterrent to Russian aggression. If the U.S. aim is to enhance stability in Europe, the case against a nuclear-armed Ukraine is unpersuasive.\n> Second, it is unlikely that Ukraine will transfer its remaining nuclear weapons to Russia, the state it fears most. The United States and its European allies can complain bitterly about this decision, but they are not in a position to force Ukraine to go nonnuclear. Moreover, pursuing a confrontation with Ukraine over the nuclear issue raises the risks of war by making the Russians more daring, the Ukrainians more fearful, and the Americans less able to defuse a crisis between them.\n\nAs for American presence in Europe, this is also clearly stated as a general assumption about the immediate European geopolitical climate in which the various scenarios he examines would play out, e.g.:\n\n> One might expect the burden of deterring a resurgent Russia to fall to an American-dominated nato, in effect, bringing back the Cold War order that kept Europe at peace for 45 years. That outcome is not likely, however, for a number of reasons. The United States is reducing force levels in Europe significantly, which will cause it to lose much of its leverage on the continent. Even if Russia behaves aggressively, U.S. troops are not likely to return to Europe in large numbers, mainly because the Germans are capable of bearing most of the burden of checking the Russians.\n\nor later:\n\n> Neither America nor its European allies are eager to take on an expensive new commitment; on the contrary, natos power is shrinking rapidly. \n\nThe gotcha isn't so much about how many of these he got wrong. Much like economists, IR theorists make incorrect predictions pretty much all the time. But it's hard to overstate just how much flak Mearsheimer got for this back then, when the world was extremely different. Russia was still unstable and the question of who controls the nuclear weapons, and Yeltsin's somewhat unconvincing answer, were still haunting people. Civil war was raging in the Balkans and the possibility of ethnic conflict between parties that controlled nuclear weapons, or at least some nuclear material that they could use destructively, was entertained as an actual possibility.\n\nThe idea of Russian and American troops leaving Europe was actually not far-fetched at all. The Soviet Union had crumbled, Clinton and Yeltsin were shaking hands on TV and there were analysts in the US who seriously thought Russia would be an US partner going forward. People looked around and thought neither the US nor Russia *needed* them anymore, the Cold War was gone and out, and other than the occasional peace mission in conflict areas (e.g. Bosnia) US troops would mostly be needed elsewhere, like the Middle East. It wasn't an unreasonable assumption at the time at all.\n\nHis essay was actually well-received in most non-political circles, it's an excellent application of realist theory and, like most essays of this type, its value lies primarily in its exploratory character, not in the predictions it makes. It's one of the essays I recommend reading to anyone interested in understanding that period and it's an extremely valuable tool for understanding the post-Soviet region even today. Many of its points still apply, and if anything applies thirty years later in this field, it's extremely likely to be a very valid point.\n\nHowever, it was very poorly received in political and activist circles. The Budapest Memorandum was hailed as a great success of the Clinton administration -- not that *that* aged much better -- so up until 9/11 or so, Mearsheimer couldn't go anywhere without someone bringing up the damn thing, or say anything without someone suggesting that meh, that's what he said about Ukraine giving up its weapons and that worked out pretty well. \n\ntl;dr it's not a big deal in general but IMHO the world of academic and political debate made it a bigger deal than it should've been for him.",

I've said previously that Ukraine apparently felt they had a choice between holding Donbas, holding Kyiv, and holding the South. At best, they could pick two. Kyiv is, well, Kyiv; and Donbas had a decade of fortifications built up and troops stationed there with extensive local knowledge. They chose to defend Kyiv and try to hold the line in Donbas on the assumption that if they tried to hold all three, they'd lose all three. I think they knew they'd lose in the end, though.\n\nDo you remember your thoughts on February 23rd when Ukraine was about to be invaded? The general assumption by **everyone I read** was that AFU would be curbstomped. The Russian military was considered quite formidable prior to the invasion. Ukraine was just a former Soviet satellite state with less than a third the population. They didn't inherit nearly the massive stock of Soviet firepower that Russia did. They didn't have significant ongoing hardware development. They had a tiny Air Force. No Navy. Up to that point, the last time the West donated large-scale military aid for a conflict was World War II. It was not at all clear that the West would support Ukraine at Lend-Lease levels. And if that support *hadn't* come, Russia would be in Kyiv now, even if they were fought off during the first Battle of Kyiv. Ukraine would've run out of shells within, say, six months, and that would've been the end of the war. They knew it, Russia knew it, everyone knew it.\n\nZelensky (and the West) was looking at an insurgency campaign to hold as much as they could, not a peer to peer conflict. We're looking back with the knowledge that Ukraine *could* fight the Russian military toe to toe, and mostly succeed. We absolutely did *not* have that knowledge at the time. It is the most likely explanation for a failure to defend the South, and why the West up to that point had given weapons chiefly designed to promote a costly insurgency: MANPADs, small arms, and ATGMs.\n\nI just think it's a mistake to say Zelensky \"screwed up\" by not trying to hold the South. In retrospect, sure. But was not clear at the time that Ukraine could even hold Kyiv.\n\nAs for the witch hunt, I think Ukraine planned to delay the Southern advance by blowing bridges. It's legitimate to ask why the Antonivsky Bridge wasn't taken out, for instance. That directly caused the Battle of Mykolaiv and the occupation of Kherson. And other bridges in the south could've been blown, but weren't. I think it's unfair to call that investigation a witch hunt or a blame game.\n\nZelensky will end up being reevaluated after the war primarily for not taking more steps to beef up fixed defenses in light of US Intel about an invasion from Belarus. It seems clear he largely dismissed these warnings, or didn't know what to do about them besides try to placate Russia and not poke the hornet's nest with provocation. I think that'll be a fair criticism, in time. I just don't think this one is.",

Which only left their garrison location to the SE shortly before the war started, and couldn't reach their defensive positions near the border (multiple rivers, a limited number of bridges, deliberately flooded regions), with only a portion of their brigade able to make it to Ivankiv, about 70 kilometers from the border, and still being too weak to hold them at the Teteriv River, forced to retreat multiple times until right at the suburbs.

Tavria/Kherson: There were only two UAF brigades assigned to defend the entire region, especially the Ithmus of Perekop. Apparently they weren't allowed to dig in, lay additional minefields, etc because only martial law allowed that (I don't buy it, but I don't know UA law). Each brigade was only around half strength, and one of the brigades was still mostly being trained near Mykolaiv, so nowhere near the blatantly obvious invasion sector where the Southern Military District was staged. That area was a bottleneck, the UAF should have held it longer than they did, but that's impossible with too few barely trained brigades, at half strength, because SOMEBODY decided not to mobilize until roughly 12 hours before the invasion started, or take other measures to increase defenses.\n\nBy the time the UAF could rally in the South, Kherson Oblast had already fallen, the Russians had traveled the length of the South to link up with units around Mariupol sealing that pocket, they were advancing on the city of Zapor. and northwards, they had successfully crossed the Dnieper westwards and were almost to Mykolaiv. Then being so grossly overextended and finally running into UAF resistance they couldn't overcome, they were stopped. But that meant deep advances most everywhere the Russians attacked.\n\nConsidering how unready the Russians were, had the UAF actually been prepared, [this wouldn't have been the outcome](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNf1KwkakAQTX-s.jpg:large).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The general assumption by everyone I read was that AFU would be curbstomped.\n\nAnd they should have been too.

Maybe it would&#39;ve looked like Russia&#39;s winter actions near Vuhledar or maybe they would have waited for summer anyway.</p>\n</div>",

The strategic value of the southern front is what made the deception credible and effective. For deception to work, we need another credible threat to effectively keep the enemy guessing. Which is why I asked where else you think Ukraine should have pushed (which went unanswered)- without identifying an axis where you could credibly draw troops away to, you can't stretch the lines enough to exploit. So what other axis had enough strategic value to force Russia to pull troops away from those vital southern lines? It's very easy to cast stones without offering up an alternative, and ideally we should resist the urge when possible. I'm trying to think of where else Ukraine could push to generate strategic value, and can't come up with any great alternatives. Again, open to ideas but we need a point of comparison to have a meaningful discussion and for that particular critique to stick.\n\n>The evidence is 1) heavy military casualties 2) heavy ammunition expenditure while already critically low 3) veteran offensive capable units committed to defend Bakhmut being chewed up. \n\nThat isn't evidence the delta would have been enough for Ukraine to mount offensive operations in the south fast enough to prevent Russia from digging in though. Indeed, by that point Russia had **already** dug in a pretty fair degree. Nobody's disputing the above, the question is whether it had significant impacts on the timing and strength of the offensive. I'd argue the pace of western aid and general training of mobilized Ukrainian forces had a much bigger impact on that tempo than the losses incurred in Bakhmut.\n\n>First, the Ukrainians foolishly underestimated Russian defenses and didn't think they'd take heavy casualties breaking through and exploiting Russian defenses\n\nI see no real evidence of the assertion Ukraine thought they'd immediately break through with light casualties. We didn't see advances in mass or much positioning to suggest they had assumed the Russians would just roll over. Don't conflate Reddit Ukraine cheerleaders for their military command, who were actively trying to temper expectations even before the offensive started.\n\n>Which is why every UAF soldier lost in Bakhmut mattered, especially competent troops who might have been veterans of previous successful offensive operations that were lost doing fruitless defensive operations that they couldn't win\n\nCeding that their experience mattered, a lack of manpower isn't what's held Ukraine back during the offensive. Their main issues have been the fundamental challenges the minefields present in a combat environment involving drone based artillery without air superiority or an abundance of specialized mine clearing equipment and difficulty coordinating actions at scale. There's no good way to simply breeze past those defenses under those circumstances (even if coordination was improved).\n\n>Wagner is an assault force, not meant to be used for defensive operations. By electing to continue fighting in Bakhmut when the tactical situation went catastrophic, the UAF gave Wagner something positive to do all winter and spring that would hurt Ukrainian offensive potential, while not harming Russian defensive potential. \n\nWe both know it wasn't all Wagner in Bakhmut, and they relied heavily on the forces Russia mobilized to soak up casualties before Wagner assault troops stepped in to advance. Wagner was reliant on the Russian military to provide artillery and support their operations, and Russian failures to do that adequately were at least nominally the root of their mutiny. We can debate the strategic value of defending Bakhmut that heavily, but that discussion can't be complete without also acknowledging that Russia also committed significant resources towards an objective with little to no strategic value, took massively more casualties than Ukraine, and also lost manpower and resources that would be better suited towards other operations.

The strategic value of the southern front is what made the deception credible and effective. For deception to work, we need another credible threat to effectively keep the enemy guessing. Which is why I asked where else you think Ukraine should have pushed (which went unanswered)- without identifying an axis where you could credibly draw troops away to, you can&#39;t stretch the lines enough to exploit. So what other axis had enough strategic value to force Russia to pull troops away from those vital southern lines? It&#39;s very easy to cast stones without offering up an alternative, and ideally we should resist the urge when possible. I&#39;m trying to think of where else Ukraine could push to generate strategic value, and can&#39;t come up with any great alternatives. Again, open to ideas but we need a point of comparison to have a meaningful discussion and for that particular critique to stick.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The evidence is 1) heavy military casualties 2) heavy ammunition expenditure while already critically low 3) veteran offensive capable units committed to defend Bakhmut being chewed up. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That isn&#39;t evidence the delta would have been enough for Ukraine to mount offensive operations in the south fast enough to prevent Russia from digging in though. Indeed, by that point Russia had <strong>already</strong> dug in a pretty fair degree. Nobody&#39;s disputing the above, the question is whether it had significant impacts on the timing and strength of the offensive. I&#39;d argue the pace of western aid and general training of mobilized Ukrainian forces had a much bigger impact on that tempo than the losses incurred in Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, the Ukrainians foolishly underestimated Russian defenses and didn&#39;t think they&#39;d take heavy casualties breaking through and exploiting Russian defenses</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I see no real evidence of the assertion Ukraine thought they&#39;d immediately break through with light casualties. We didn&#39;t see advances in mass or much positioning to suggest they had assumed the Russians would just roll over. Don&#39;t conflate Reddit Ukraine cheerleaders for their military command, who were actively trying to temper expectations even before the offensive started.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Which is why every UAF soldier lost in Bakhmut mattered, especially competent troops who might have been veterans of previous successful offensive operations that were lost doing fruitless defensive operations that they couldn&#39;t win</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ceding that their experience mattered, a lack of manpower isn&#39;t what&#39;s held Ukraine back during the offensive. Their main issues have been the fundamental challenges the minefields present in a combat environment involving drone based artillery without air superiority or an abundance of specialized mine clearing equipment and difficulty coordinating actions at scale. There&#39;s no good way to simply breeze past those defenses under those circumstances (even if coordination was improved).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wagner is an assault force, not meant to be used for defensive operations. By electing to continue fighting in Bakhmut when the tactical situation went catastrophic, the UAF gave Wagner something positive to do all winter and spring that would hurt Ukrainian offensive potential, while not harming Russian defensive potential. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We both know it wasn&#39;t all Wagner in Bakhmut, and they relied heavily on the forces Russia mobilized to soak up casualties before Wagner assault troops stepped in to advance. Wagner was reliant on the Russian military to provide artillery and support their operations, and Russian failures to do that adequately were at least nominally the root of their mutiny. We can debate the strategic value of defending Bakhmut that heavily, but that discussion can&#39;t be complete without also acknowledging that Russia also committed significant resources towards an objective with little to no strategic value, took massively more casualties than Ukraine, and also lost manpower and resources that would be better suited towards other operations. Those mobiks would have provided far greater value defending trenches on the southern front than soaking up casualties for Wagner, and it&#39;s an open question as to whether or not Russia&#39;s own artillery expenditures haven&#39;t impacted their own operational pace in their defense as the offensive has worn on. The balance of these factors between the belligerents is required for any discussion about Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It can be both?</p>\n\n<p>No, it can&#39;t be.

The strategic value of the southern front is what made the deception credible and effective. \n\nThere was no deception plan in the South, that was an obvious offensive because they told the Russians they were going to do it. The deception was massing a corps sized assault force in Kharkiv Oblast that the Russians didn't spot in time to react to. Proving it could be done.

That's basic cause and effect. It's why Normandy was less well defended than Calais in 1944. \n\nSecond, the Land Bridge is 150 kilometers wide. Cutting it is a suitable strategic goal, which means they didn't need to add Melitipol as an objective, which was chosen because they stacked strategic goals, take the key city on the coast and then swing west into Kherson, liberate all of Tavria.  They got greedy, made worse because they created an incredibly audacious plan that first involved telling the Russians were they were going to launch it. Instead they could have chosen pretty much anywhere other than Orikhiv as their main effort and been more successful. Newsflash, that place is defended by three distinct operational defensive lines as part of the Survokin Line whereas most of the rest of the South only has one; that's not a coincidence. \n\nThird, the Ukrainian ultimate strategy to win this war isn't to reclaim territory, it's to break the Russian will and resolve to continue fighting what amounts to a pointless conflict they can't win, that will only crush them societally and economically as well as militarily. Even if they liberate everything lost since 2014, that doesn't at all lead to Russia quitting and this war ending. That means their strategy is exhaustion, a subset of attrition strategy. Made easy as they and their followers are so heavily focused on Russian losses already. They could have arranged this offensive to strike pretty much **anywhere** in Ukraine with the goal to cause major damage to Russian forces primarily, and secondarily to liberate territory. \n\nThat was the strategy in numerous past wars where the lines largely went static and positional warfare dominated (WW1, Korea from 51 onwards), so there is definitely precedence. And before you suggest that isn't politically possible, the Ukrainians are doing that right now and have been doing it since about mid July when they switched to attrition, and nobody is actually bitching that they must stop and liberate territory quicker. \n\nFourth, the Ukrainians could have bothered ensuring their offensively capable brigades were actually offensively capable. Because, news flash, that is kind of important when it comes to carrying out successful offensive operations. Nobody forced them to grind up their best brigades over the same winter-spring where they were supposed to be preparing for the big strategic offensive, the one they pitched to the West to get more support. Nobody forced them to keep those chewed up still quality brigades in the wrong part of Ukraine attacking Bakhmut or defending Kupyansk instead of attacking the strategic main effort. Nobody forced them to undertrain their new brigades, nobody forced them not to train their officers, etc. \n\nThese were all choices. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I see no real evidence of the assertion Ukraine thought they'd immediately break through with light casualties.\n\nThe evidence is 1) When Zelensky admitted the delay and costs within 2 weeks of the offensive starting, which means it wasn't planned, which means they didn't think it would happen 2) they used two brigades to launch the main effort assault to score a breach, whereas they have something like 7 brigades there now grinding away, which obviously points that they didn't plan for needing more if they could accomplish it with less, inside two weeks 3) That they changed tactics within the first month to focus on dismounted operations because their mechanized breaching plan was unsustainable and ineffective. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We both know it wasn't all Wagner in Bakhmut, and they relied heavily on the forces Russia mobilized to soak up casualties before Wagner assault troops stepped in to advance. \n\nThose forces Russia mobilized to soak up casualties were literally Wagner recruited convicts. \n\nHow can you write out a full paragraph when you don't even know this?

It's the whole ball of wax really since holding it provides economic, social, and military benefits that outweigh any losses they may suffer elsewhere.

I&#39;ll accept the correction, but the overall point stands, and I still don&#39;t think we can talk about how Bakhmut impacted Ukrainian readiness without also discussing the balance of what it did for Russia.</p>\n</div>",

But when a concerted UAF attack is reported by Russian defenders that gets the Orlan drones vectored in, the Lancets are launched if AFV are reported or they know where UAF arty is firing from, and KA-52 are sortied from the Azov coast to go hunting.\n\nObviously when UAF AFV are moving they're vulnerable to being spotted and engaged with long range weapons, but they can't really hide when stopped either; even in defilade positions they're only hidden from Russian ground forces but not overhead drones. That means they can't easily be stationed immediately on the Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT), and that comes with significant tactical problems. \n\nDuring sustained ops they will need to be hidden from view somewhere either outside of Russian common drone range or in a treeline somewhere hopefully closer, dispersed so they aren't clumped up, but not too dispersed that they can't be led and controlled properly. When they get a mission they need to load, assemble, drive up to the FLOT to do whatever the mission is (likely including breaching more obstacles covered by fire), then disperse again to hide afterwards. \n\nBecause they aren't immediately at the FLOT, they are more vulnerable when they're moving to being spotted by drones during the approach march or by Russian ground forces during the attack, increasing their exposure means greater threat. \n\nThe biggest mitigation against these threats aren't available to the UAF. Due to issues with electronic spectrum fratricide, the UAF can't run EW too often to deal with the drone threat. Nor do they possess organic tactical ADA, especially SHORAD to deal with KA-52 helicopters or drones, which is massed to defend cities and civilian infrastructure. They should be able to use friendly arty, especially DPICM, to suppress ground launched ATGMs, but they can't find or suppress Lancet launch sites deeper in the rear. Nor do they prefer using smoke to obscure the battlefield because then the UAF commanders in the rear can't use their own drones to see and C3 the fight (apparently company commanders and above don't move with the troops). And most of the UAF aren't trained or equipped properly to conduct night ops.\n\nWith dismounted ops, they're more dispersed, smaller groups so smaller targets, less vulnerable to most Russian weaponry, likely exploiting weaknesses in the Russian defenses that weren't built primarily to counter a dismounted infantry assault threat. Most of the threats against them can be suppressed by supporting fires. \n\nMore so, they typically have shorter routes from their assembly areas and line of departures (their existing dug in position, recently taken) to their attack position and objective (likely next treeline or trenches within 1 km), so there is a good chance they can achieve a level of surprise that most of the AFV cannot.",

Take the sacrifice to temporarily lose friendly drone coverage to deny the enemy. Same goes with EW, sometimes it's better to accept friendly EW fratricide to deny the enemy theirs, especially during high risk, high reward missions like a mechanized combined arms breach, which has so much already stacked against it from working, requires near perfect execution of a really good plan trying to take away every enemy advantage possible.\n\nWhile the US only did legit combined arms breaching operations twice since Korea (Iraq, 91 and 03), it has been regularly practicing them against professional OPFOR for many many decades, especially from the 90s onwards (Iraq told us we needed to get better at it).\n\nEven during the GWOT, we still practiced breaching operations regularly, but focused on urban ops specifically small unit dismounted, not mechanized combined armed breaching.

I think Tokmat would have been a feint, with the actual main effort somewhere else. \n\nBut for argument's sake, we'd probably have identified our best armored brigades, the ones with the most talent and the commanders who are studs, they'd have spent all winter preparing and training on the breach. Rehearsals, rehearsals, rehearsals. They'd know the attack point so well through terrain analysis and sandtables that they would probably have every treeline and trench memorized.  \n\nDuring the winter we'd have conducted extensive recon of the area, including probing attacks probably (everywhere, not just in one location), to test defenses and find out what was actually there, see if we can identify enemy SOPs and TTPs. Plus distributing lessons learned from active theaters (like Bakhmut, about Lancets) would be adopted into the planning and rehearsals. \n\nLikely mass a legit heavy corps along the smallest frontage possible, with not only maneuver elements but also engineering support. If we didn't have enough breaching equipment, we'd make some more like we did in Desert Storm, or otherwise improvise. \n\nWe'd have massed every artillery piece and rocket launcher possible, with the largest ammo stockpile possible, with the rest of the theater largely stripped and put into economy of force mode, telling commanders of most of the territory in Ukraine \"Try your best to hold, but you're not getting help, you're bottom priority.\" \n\nThe number of units forward would involve the number of lanes chosen to create. The more the lanes, the more units they need forward. The more the lanes, the less supporting assets per lane. Most likely an ABCT would have at least one battalion conducting the breach, with subsequent battalions ready to reinforce or exploit as necessary. But there is no clearcut rule, it's very much terrain and situation dependent, and how much engineering support there is (every point of breach needs at least an engineering platoon, if not more). But a key principle for breaching is massing. There can rarely be too much, especially since heavy casualties are nearly guaranteed. \n\nWe'd have prioritized EW and SHORAD as far forward as possible to deal with enemy drones. We'd have done as much as possible at night. But we'd still need to rely heavily on deception and surprise. \n\nEven then, considering the depth of the Russian defenses in that area, it would have been slow going and casualty intensive even if it moved forward. The density of the minefields might have been a major problem, and possibly the other issues (though concentrated EW and SHORAD might have negated much of the drone issue). But I think we'd have done it better than the Ukrainians because they made a lot of very amateur mistakes, or those due relating to their Soviet-era doctrines, which come with tactical ramifications.  \n\nI've said it before, I'll say it again. The combined arms breach against a legit enemy defense is one of the hardest operations to perform. Getting it right means not just getting everything right, it means being lucky. But it's not going to be successful if some of the most basic principles are ignored or can't be performed because of professional competence-related problems.",

Novaya Gazeta did an article about the state of the Russian arms industry and used a lot of anonymous sources from the military and arms industry. Among many other things, they claimed that one of the main reasons for the delay of both the T-14 Armata and the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV where inability to domestically produce high-grade steel for the barrels.  \n\nThe 2A88 gun of the 2S35 & the 2A82-1M of the T-14 are brand new guns, that intents to vastly out-preform their most modern western counterparts. I find it completely credible that russia is lacking material, equipment and knowledge to actually produce these guns. Historically russia have been lacking behind the west in this field for a long time, and to magically not just catch up but overtake is not very realistic.\n\nLot's of commentators and outlets noticed Novaya Gazetas article and published their own stories based on that, but forgot to mention that the materials issue (that are much more than just material issues) only applied to the 2s35 & T-14 gun.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>These claims comes from an <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/11/02/the-barren-barrels-en\">article</a> published by Novaya gazeta in late 2022. Novaya Gazeta did an article about the state of the Russian arms industry and used a lot of anonymous sources from the military and arms industry. Among many other things, they claimed that one of the main reasons for the delay of both the T-14 Armata and the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV where inability to domestically produce high-grade steel for the barrels.  </p>\n\n<p>The 2A88 gun of the 2S35 &amp; the 2A82-1M of the T-14 are brand new guns, that intents to vastly out-preform their most modern western counterparts. I find it completely credible that russia is lacking material, equipment and knowledge to actually produce these guns. Historically russia have been lacking behind the west in this field for a long time, and to magically not just catch up but overtake is not very realistic.</p>\n\n<p>Lot&#39;s of commentators and outlets noticed Novaya Gazetas article and published their own stories based on that, but forgot to mention that the materials issue (that are much more than just material issues) only applied to the 2s35 &amp; T-14 gun. Regular arty and SPG barrels are produced domestically in russia and they are very rudimentary things that does not even use chromium liners like most western counterparts. There are no credible reasons to believe they suddenly can&#39;t produce them anymore.</p>\n</div>",

However, in other instances the modifications to the TM-62 mines are more complex.  They feature stabilizing fins fabricated from PVC piping and large water bottles, as well as a vane-armed fuzing system.  The adhoc fins do seem to work surprisingly well at stabilizing the TM-62 mines.  The most interesting part to me is the vane-armed fuzing system.  Such improvised fuzing systems have the potential to offer greater flexibility when compared with the 3.5-4 second time delay of the standard UZRG/UZRGM/UZRGM-2 grenade fuzes being used.",

                "body": "Assuming you're referring to LRASM/AGM-158, the US Navy is unfortunately very spare when it comes to procurement on this item. Production lead time from order to delivery is 20-24 months so ramping up production is extremely challenging and is going to take time. Programs have been put in place to encourage an increase in total run rate capacity, but that won't really bear fruit until FY26/27 onwards.\n\nThis is functionally the end of my reply, but I'll leave a wall below to anyone who is reading and possibly interested in USN Procurement, LRASM and why the current procurement rate and inventory situation is abysmal:\n\nThere have been a lot of press releases from Lockheed and various third parties recently touting doubling the production rate up to \"1000 missiles\" from the existing 500 annual run rate. But the devil is in the details for these procurements and it's almost like they're trusting we won't go looking up the actual procurement numbers because frankly the press release is complete horseshit anyway as USN+USAF procurement doesn't even come close to reaching 1000 units by FY24 which is what their press release claimed... It actually doesn't even come close to 1000 units by FY28 but that's a different issue...\n\nAlso that 500 total procurement rate includes JASSM and is not exclusively LRASM, the type the navy expects to largely defeat the PLAN in an engagement around Taiwan.\n\nThe actual procurement quantity of LRASM has historically been extremely low. 2022 saw procurement of only 38 missiles and by the end of 2022 only 200 of these missiles existed in inventory. The Pentagon in wargames expects to expend anywhere between **800-1200** of these missiles at a minimum to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and these wargames were pretty dire in terms of how poorly they reflected on LRASM reliance and low inventory. One of the participants is quoted as saying they would trade every US ship available for additional LRASM missiles.\n\nThis wargame was also ***\\*extremely generous\\****. It assumed that the US had an existing stockpile of between 800-1200 units of missiles and in all the scenarios they tested the US ran through that stockpile long before the end of the conflict. LRASM proved decisive toward determining the outcome of a Taiwan conflict, with the US winning a pyrrhic victory. Problem is, that pyrrhic victory was the result of a horseshit assumption, which was that inventory of LRASM was approximately 1000 units.\n\n**Problem is it's only 200.**\n\nAt current production rate it would still take until **2032** at a minimum to procure and inventory enough LRASM to meet that target and in that wargame the USN still ran dry long before the end of the conflict. So at a minimum nine further years, presuming the PLAN doesn't drastically grow in that timeframe causing a further increase in the required inventory of course...\n\nIn the last five years alone the PLAN has commissioned 83 new vessels, 26 of which are heavy tonnage destroyers (doubling the size of their destroyer force) along with 34 corvettes, 7 amphibious transport docks and even 2 aircraft carriers...\n\nIn the next nine years they're set to continue rapidly expanding on this ramp up in naval production and with the PLAN implementing new construction guidelines for civilian vessels to have dual use capability civil/military, particularly Ro/Ro ferries, the total number of military/war targets that LRASM will be expected to engage may drastically increase by the time that inventory reaches the number assumed in the wargame.\n\nThis isn't to say the USN is entirely asleep at the wheel, this year they've started engaging in MYP (Multi Year Procurement) a new tweak to procurement which is essentially ordering multiple years and budgets in advance to help provide stability to long term procurement and encourage the industry partners to increase capacity.\n\nWhat this means is that we actually have order quantities for LRASM out to FY2028 and frankly it's not looking good... FY24 will see a staggering increase from 88 units to 94 units...  By FY28 the USN expects to have received delivery of 488 units. So 488 additional units are set to be procured by years end FY28 on top of the existing stockpile of 200 units. This is all assuming of course that Lockheed stay on target. It wouldn't be the first time they've dropped the procurement ball.\n\nOverall it's a pretty bad position to be in and production capacity increases are looking marginal at best if USN procurement is anything to go by. Certainly not a doubling of production and inventories are set to be dangerously low well into the mid 2030s. Which it's worth noting, at which point a potential Taiwan showdown could have already occurred...",

So at a minimum nine further years, presuming the PLAN doesn&#39;t drastically grow in that timeframe causing a further increase in the required inventory of course...</p>\n\n<p>In the last five years alone the PLAN has commissioned 83 new vessels, 26 of which are heavy tonnage destroyers (doubling the size of their destroyer force) along with 34 corvettes, 7 amphibious transport docks and even 2 aircraft carriers...</p>\n\n<p>In the next nine years they&#39;re set to continue rapidly expanding on this ramp up in naval production and with the PLAN implementing new construction guidelines for civilian vessels to have dual use capability civil/military, particularly Ro/Ro ferries, the total number of military/war targets that LRASM will be expected to engage may drastically increase by the time that inventory reaches the number assumed in the wargame.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t to say the USN is entirely asleep at the wheel, this year they&#39;ve started engaging in MYP (Multi Year Procurement) a new tweak to procurement which is essentially ordering multiple years and budgets in advance to help provide stability to long term procurement and encourage the industry partners to increase capacity.</p>\n\n<p>What this means is that we actually have order quantities for LRASM out to FY2028 and frankly it&#39;s not looking good... FY24 will see a staggering increase from 88 units to 94 units...  By FY28 the USN expects to have received delivery of 488 units. So 488 additional units are set to be procured by years end FY28 on top of the existing stockpile of 200 units. This is all assuming of course that Lockheed stay on target. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time they&#39;ve dropped the procurement ball.</p>\n\n<p>Overall it&#39;s a pretty bad position to be in and production capacity increases are looking marginal at best if USN procurement is anything to go by. Certainly not a doubling of production and inventories are set to be dangerously low well into the mid 2030s. Which it&#39;s worth noting, at which point a potential Taiwan showdown could have already occurred...</p>\n</div>",
