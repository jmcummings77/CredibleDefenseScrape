Wagner troops so far have failed to take their main target - the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut - despite months of trying and staggering losses. Now, Prigozhin is planning to shift focus back to Africa, the people said.\n\n>The shift is a sudden turn in fortunes for Prigozhin, a longtime Putin ally who catapulted himself to prominence as the tough-guy alternative to Russia\u2019s faltering military in Ukraine.\n\n>But as his fighters struggled to advance more than a few dozen kilometers in and around Bakhmut despite months of fighting, top commanders managed to sow doubts with Putin about Wagner\u2019s vaunted military prowess, arguing that what results he got came from using waves of convict troops sent to their deaths, people close to the Kremlin and intelligence services said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that aren\u2019t public. \n\n>The Russian leader ultimately stepped in to transfer prison recruiting to the Defense Ministry, cutting off the flow of recruits to Wagner. Munitions supplies from the military slowed. Prigozhin\u2019s independence also rankled with the Kremlin.\n\n>\u201cPrigozhin is getting in everyone\u2019s way,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R.Politik political consultancy.  \u201cHis only protection now is his personal relationship with Putin, who still considers him useful in a certain way.\u201d\n\n>After weeks of complaining publicly that the military wasn\u2019t delivering vital shells and other supplies, Prigozhin admitted earlier this month that Wagner would have to \u201creset and cut down its size\u201d after the battle for Bakhmut is over. He recently touted Wagner\u2019s capture of a village in the area, but didn\u2019t mention that its population was only two people according to the last census.\n\n>There\u2019s no sign at present that Prigozhin will redeploy troops to Africa, but the people familiar with the situation said operations there are likely to get more of his attention in the future as the situation in Ukraine has become more difficult for his forces.\n\n>A recruitment announcement posted Monday invited applicants for mercenary vacancies for six months in Ukraine and 9-14 months in Africa, specifying that those who want to serve in African countries would be placed on reserve. \n\n>A one-time catering entrepreneur who said he founded Wagner in the Kremlin\u2019s first war in Ukraine in 2014, Prigozhin sent troops to help Russia shore up Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad. He also built a network in Africa stretching from Libya to Sudan, Mali and the Central African Republic in support of the Kremlin\u2019s geopolitical goals. Most recently, there have been reports Wagner is moving into Burkina Faso after the country ordered French troops to leave. The US and its allies have slapped sanctions on Prigozhin and Wagner.  \n\n>Leaving on an African tour last month, French President Emmanuel Macron branded Wagner as \u201cthe life insurance of failing regimes and putschists,\u201d calling it \u201ca group of criminal mercenaries.\u201d \n\n>Italian intelligence warned in a recent report that the increased activity of Russian private military companies could destabilize Northern and Western Africa, prompting an increase of migrant flows toward the European Union. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is extremely worried about a summer migration wave, according to a person familiar with her thinking. Her defense minister publicly blamed the mercenaries for fueling a surge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean. Prigozhin denied that.\n\n>>Convict Soldiers\n\n>Since the invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin shifted his major efforts there, winning Kremlin permission to recruit prisoners with promises of early release if they survived six months on the battlefield.\n\n>Sent into combat with little preparation, about half of the 40,000 convicts who signed up have been killed or wounded in the fighting in Bakhmut and the capture earlier this year of the small salt-mining town of Soledar, according to UK intelligence estimates. Wagner in addition has some 10,000 professional contractors fighting in Ukraine that it has deployed more cautiously, the US says. \n\n>Prigozhin announced last week that he\u2019d opened recruitment centers in sports centers and martial arts clubs in 42 Russian cities and said Sunday he hopes to sign up 30,000 new recruits, but it\u2019s unclear how successful he\u2019ll be in attracting volunteers. \n\n>His influence seemed to peak late last year as he publicly attacked Kremlin appointees in Russia and spooked insiders with calls for Stalin-style crackdowns on opponents. Sergei Surovikin, a top general with experience in Syria who was seen as an ally, was given command of the Ukraine invasion.\n\n>Prigozhin saved the harshest treatment for top military commanders. In a video posted on social media in December, Wagner fighters used expletives to describe Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s top general, because of their shortage of ammunition. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu also came in for attacks.\n\n>The first outward sign that Prigozhin had gone too far came early this year, when Putin promoted Gerasimov to oversee the war in place of the Prigozhin ally.\n\n>Revelations of extreme brutality by Wagner including summary executions of ex-inmates who refused orders to fight that have emerged from defectors who fled to Europe damaged Prigozhin\u2019s reputation in Putin\u2019s eyes, one of the people with knowledge of the issue said.\n\n>Prigozhin\u2019s shock troops remain useful from a military perspective, and if Bakhmut falls, Wagner may continue to play a role in further assaults in a bid to seize the remaining Ukrainian-held cities in the eastern Donbas region, said two people close to the Kremlin and intelligence services.\n\n>>Political Reach\n\n>But he won\u2019t be allowed any opportunity in state-controlled media to claim credit for taking Bakhmut, which would be the first significant advance for Russia since mid-2022, said one of them. \n\n>Prigozhin has also hinted that he\u2019s not giving up political ambitions inside Russia, where he controls a powerful pro-Kremlin media company and enjoys lucrative state contracts. He said in a recent video message that Wagner will \u201ctransform itself from the best private army in the world into an army with ideology, and this ideology will be the struggle for justice.\u201d \n\n>Ultimately, without the approval of the Russian leadership, that too could be denied him.\n\n>\u201cPrigozhin became far too independent, which violated the balance between the elite clans,\u201d said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cOnly Putin can decide what the limits are.\u201d",

Apparently it is &quot;official&quot; official when they sign some paper with Stoltenberg and the paper is deposited in the US National Archives.</p>\n</div>",

Whether they've received explicit media training for having a large social media following, we don't know, but that brings me to the second point:\n\n2) Occam's Razor. It feels great for us pro-UA peeps to feel a sense of security that the Ukrainian leadership knows what they're doing. But I fear we could be acting the same way the pro-RU crowd (literally) coped with the goodwill gestures of the northern front and Kherson: the leadership doesn't know what they're doing, they're actually just incompetent. It is a far simpler explanation to say that Bakhmut is being held on much more dire and nefarious reasons, such as as a political symbol like Stalingrad in 1942.\n\nThis is not without precedent: the Ukrainians have completely botched the Crimean front and from most reports, Sumy was held by [people who were civilians mere days beforehand](https://mwi.usma.edu/how-ukraines-roving-teams-of-light-infantry-helped-win-the-battle-of-sumy-lessons-for-the-us-army/). I.e, there was no organised resistance in that area initially, and a massive Russian defeat was dealt by the grassroots population rather than Ukrainian leadership competence. \n\nThe point I propose is that the Ukrainian leadership didn't show competence by holding off the Russians in 2022, they showed that they were less incompetent than the Russians. With the newfound support and worldwide attention, 2023 might be showing that they've become arrogant.\n\n...but this is coming from a guy who loudly said Kherson won't be liberated in 2022, as /u/hatesranged will no doubt remind me.",

I.e, there was no organised resistance in that area initially, and a massive Russian defeat was dealt by the grassroots population rather than Ukrainian leadership competence. </p>\n\n<p>The point I propose is that the Ukrainian leadership didn&#39;t show competence by holding off the Russians in 2022, they showed that they were less incompetent than the Russians. With the newfound support and worldwide attention, 2023 might be showing that they&#39;ve become arrogant.</p>\n\n<p>...but this is coming from a guy who loudly said Kherson won&#39;t be liberated in 2022, as <a href=\"/u/hatesranged\">/u/hatesranged</a> will no doubt remind me.</p>\n</div>",

The only real difference is that a right-leaning government would be more hawkish on EU level bailouts and such (so situations like the 2011 Greek debt crisis would be affected), and probably be less active in pursuing green initiatives.\n\nMarin is popular among left leaning Finns. But it comes down to Finland having a proportional multi-member district system. IMO her biggest problem is that while she appeals to millennial voters in a big way, she's not in a large enough district that her coattails would carry that much extra for her party. Their candidate quality is mediocre in the bigger districts, and the rest of their lineup mostly appeals to their large pensioner + public sector worker base. So in most districts, the millennial voters will rather vote for the Greens (they are similar to the German ones except less anti-nuclear) who have a similar appeal as Marin. Unless they choose to vote tactically.\n\nI'd say 25-30% chance she (Social Democrats) wins, 40-50 % chance the right wins, 25-30% chance the nationalists win. They are all polling quite close in the low 20s, and polls are accurate to the seat distribution within a couple percent. But winning is only the first hurdle: the winner only gets to be the first to attempt to negotiate a government coalition. There are two left-leaning parties (Greens and Left) that add up to the nationalists' size, and then a couple of smaller parties that can play kingmakers. The dynamics of these would require some sort of a spreadsheet to explain. Maybe the most important thing is that the nationalists would find it harder to negotiate a coalition than the others.",

            "body": "[**Saudi Arabia, Syria Close to Resuming Ties in Russia-Brokered Talks** *The emerging deal could leave the U.S. again on the sidelines during a dramatic shift in the Middle East\u2019s geopolitics*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-syria-close-to-resuming-ties-in-russia-brokered-talks-a340b817)  \n> \n> DUBAI\u2014Saudi Arabia and Syria are nearing an agreement to restore diplomatic ties after negotiations mediated by Russia, according to Saudi and Syrian officials familiar with the discussions, as the geopolitics of the Middle East shift.\n> \n> Talks were continuing after rounds of discussions in Moscow and Riyadh in recent weeks, the officials said. If a deal is reached, it would mark an important step to reintegrating Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad into the broader region after a brutal civil war.\n> \n> Following the Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran on resuming ties this month, the emerging Damascus-Riyadh rapprochement, if it sticks, would leave the U.S. on the sidelines again on another major Middle East development.\n> \n> Saudi and Syrian officials said negotiators are aiming to conclude a deal before a potential visit by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to Damascus after the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr in late April. But they cautioned that the discussions could still break down.\n> \n> Saudi state television reported Thursday night that negotiations have started with Syria to resume offering necessary consular services for both countries, citing a source at the foreign ministry.\n> \n> Saudi Arabia and Syria cut ties in 2012 over Mr. Assad\u2019s response to political protests that emerged from the Arab Spring uprising and his actions in the ensuing civil war. The Saudis helped orchestrate Syria\u2019s ejection from the Arab League and funded rebels fighting Mr. Assad\u2019s forces for years.\n> \n> The Russian government brokered a preliminary agreement when Mr. Assad visited Moscow last week, said officials from Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab countries involved. Senior Syrian officials then visited Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.  \n> \n> If a formal agreement is reached, a vote on reintegration of Syria into the broader region and its reconstruction will be on the agenda of the next Arab League summit expected in May in Saudi Arabia, according to Arab officials.\n> \n> Much of the Arab world has moved to set aside the rivalries that plunged the region into chaos following uprisings that began in 2011 and toppled several Middle Eastern governments. Mr. Assad has been in talks with several Arab countries to end more than a decade of isolation, and the Saudi foreign minister recently said the status quo with Syria wasn\u2019t sustainable.\n> \n> Iran also encouraged Syria to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Tehran agreed to resume diplomatic ties after a seven-year hiatus, said an Iranian official and Syrian government advisers. Other Arab countries such as Oman and Jordan have also backed the rapprochement between Damascus and Riyadh, said Arab officials familiar with the talks.\n> \n> The main focus of the talks has been security, Syrian government advisers said. The kingdom wants to resolve the issue of Saudi detainees who were captured after joining jihadist groups involved in the civil war, these people said. Damascus is seeking Riyadh\u2019s help to cut off funding for and recruitment of fundamentalist factions fighting in Syria, the officials said.    \n> Any agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria, brokered by Russia, would represent another splashy diplomatic move by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The 37-year-old who rules the oil-rich kingdom day-to-day for his aging father, King Salman, has reset relations with Washington, long the Saudi\u2019s protector in the Persian Gulf, and developed closer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping since the beginning of the Ukraine war.\n> \n> Prince Mohammed faced diplomatic isolation for several years after Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in an operation that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was ordered by the royal. The Saudi government says that Prince Mohammed wasn\u2019t involved and that the perpetrators were brought to justice.\n> \n> Prince Mohammed has tried to avoid being pulled onto any one side since the start of the Ukraine war. He has used the war as an opportunity to forge an independent foreign policy that leverages Saudi Arabia\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest oil exporter. The Syria talks come after Prince Mohammed greenlighted a detente with Iran in a deal brokered by China.\n> \n> \u201cOil exporters and authoritarian states have more in common than the democratic West, with their use of sanctions and perceived hypocrisy on respect for sovereignty,\u201d said Karen Young, senior research scholar specializing in the Middle East at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.

If a deal is reached, it would mark an important step to reintegrating Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad into the broader region after a brutal civil war.</p>\n\n<p>Following the Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran on resuming ties this month, the emerging Damascus-Riyadh rapprochement, if it sticks, would leave the U.S. on the sidelines again on another major Middle East development.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi and Syrian officials said negotiators are aiming to conclude a deal before a potential visit by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to Damascus after the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr in late April. But they cautioned that the discussions could still break down.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi state television reported Thursday night that negotiations have started with Syria to resume offering necessary consular services for both countries, citing a source at the foreign ministry.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia and Syria cut ties in 2012 over Mr. Assad\u2019s response to political protests that emerged from the Arab Spring uprising and his actions in the ensuing civil war. The Saudis helped orchestrate Syria\u2019s ejection from the Arab League and funded rebels fighting Mr. Assad\u2019s forces for years.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian government brokered a preliminary agreement when Mr. Assad visited Moscow last week, said officials from Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab countries involved. Senior Syrian officials then visited Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.  </p>\n\n<p>If a formal agreement is reached, a vote on reintegration of Syria into the broader region and its reconstruction will be on the agenda of the next Arab League summit expected in May in Saudi Arabia, according to Arab officials.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the Arab world has moved to set aside the rivalries that plunged the region into chaos following uprisings that began in 2011 and toppled several Middle Eastern governments. Mr. Assad has been in talks with several Arab countries to end more than a decade of isolation, and the Saudi foreign minister recently said the status quo with Syria wasn\u2019t sustainable.</p>\n\n<p>Iran also encouraged Syria to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Tehran agreed to resume diplomatic ties after a seven-year hiatus, said an Iranian official and Syrian government advisers. Other Arab countries such as Oman and Jordan have also backed the rapprochement between Damascus and Riyadh, said Arab officials familiar with the talks.</p>\n\n<p>The main focus of the talks has been security, Syrian government advisers said. The kingdom wants to resolve the issue of Saudi detainees who were captured after joining jihadist groups involved in the civil war, these people said. Damascus is seeking Riyadh\u2019s help to cut off funding for and recruitment of fundamentalist factions fighting in Syria, the officials said.<br/>\nAny agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria, brokered by Russia, would represent another splashy diplomatic move by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The 37-year-old who rules the oil-rich kingdom day-to-day for his aging father, King Salman, has reset relations with Washington, long the Saudi\u2019s protector in the Persian Gulf, and developed closer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping since the beginning of the Ukraine war.</p>\n\n<p>Prince Mohammed faced diplomatic isolation for several years after Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in an operation that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was ordered by the royal. The Saudi government says that Prince Mohammed wasn\u2019t involved and that the perpetrators were brought to justice.</p>\n\n<p>Prince Mohammed has tried to avoid being pulled onto any one side since the start of the Ukraine war. He has used the war as an opportunity to forge an independent foreign policy that leverages Saudi Arabia\u2019s status as the world\u2019s largest oil exporter. The Syria talks come after Prince Mohammed greenlighted a detente with Iran in a deal brokered by China.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOil exporters and authoritarian states have more in common than the democratic West, with their use of sanctions and perceived hypocrisy on respect for sovereignty,\u201d said Karen Young, senior research scholar specializing in the Middle East at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. In the Middle East, she said, \u201cthe general trend is a consensus on noninterference in domestic affairs as a principle.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mediating between Saudi Arabia and Syria bolsters Russia\u2019s presence in the Middle East. Mr. Putin\u2019s air-power intervention in the Syrian civil war proved decisive for Mr. Assad, and he has courted the Saudis, aligning oil-rich Russia with the Riyadh-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>\n\n<p>For the U.S., the deal is a reminder that, while it remains the pre-eminent military and diplomatic force in the Middle East, its influence there is waning.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. still has troops in Syria, where they are conducting antiterrorism operations in the country\u2019s southeast and with Kurdish-led forces in the northeast.

It's also prime mechanized assault territory- wide, open, flat. By isolating Crimea, Ukraine would have a strong case to make that it's winning the war.\n\n2. Starobilsk through Svatove. Cutting off the northern supply lines liberates most of Luhansk Oblast, puts pressure on Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, and if they can drive southward a ways, puts the entire eastern theater's supply lines into missile range. Russia is forced to route its supply lines through Rostov rather than Belgorod.\n\n3. Kreminna. An all out assault on the center of the Russian line with the aim of encircling Severodonetsk, isolating the units currently around Bakhmut, and smashing a large part of the Russian army before it can reconstitute. This is Operation Uranus. This essentially would win the war if they could successfully execute such a massive strike. Russia has no reserves left. They can't afford a defeat of that magnitude.\n\nI don't think Ukraine has the western tanks necessary to execute #3, and I think they'll be too wary to execute #1 given how strong Russian defenses are in Zaporizhzhia.

If that is true, Russia is already scraping the bottom of the barrel.\n\nIt  might also be that refurbishing T-55 tanks does not use the same resources (workshops, workers, equipment for upgrades) which are used for the T-62 and T-72 lines.

And it shares a common defect with a lot of bad commentary in that it ignores the entire lead up to war since 2014, 1994, 1918, or whatever date you want to choose.\n\n\"Let's try diplomacy!\" We're only here because diplomacy didn't work. We had 8 years of negotiations and two Accords with Russia as a party designed to end the Donbass conflict. From 2014 to 2022, despite the fact that Russian forces had invaded the Donbass and formally annexed Crimea, Ukraine and the West were both eminently willing to make concessions to the fait accompli in exchange for peace.\n\nThe invasion and what came with it (annexation, bombing of civilian infrastructure, deportation of children, \"de-nazification,\" etc.) represents a massive and unprovoked escalation of the conflict. Not only were Russia's demands of an anti-NATO security guarantee completely unworkable and ambiguous, but Putin also cut that negotiation process short (for example, people forget that Blinken and Lavrov had a meeting scheduled for Feb 24, 2022 to discuss direct talks between Biden and Putin). All this talk of an \"off-ramp\" for Putin ignores the fact that he blew by every exit sign posted on the way to right here, and has never signaled that he wants off despite the fact that a thousand western pundits are so sure he would de-escalate if only given the chance.\n\nFurthermore, the biggest mistake of realist commentators in this conflict has been to assume that Ukraine has no agency and is effectively a puppet of the West, which you seek to imply here. A huge driver of this conflict is that Putin put to the west a demand: Ukraine must guarantee they will never join NATO. And that confused the issue: NATO has no mechanism and no reason to agree that they would never admit Ukraine as a member, and it would have to be Ukraine that agreed to such a term. But Putin didn't negotiate with Zelenskyy as an equal (probably because his core disagreement is on the issue of Ukrainian sovereignty itself). So now we make the same error here. Can the US cede Ukrainian territory to Russia? Can the EU order the AUF to stop fighting? The answer is decidedly no. \n\nThe reason we are on this path is because Ukraine has chosen, and continues to choose at great cost, the fight. Insinuating that the West has somehow manipulated Ukraine into taking actions detrimental to its own existence is insulting to a nation of 40 million who have struggled a great deal to choose their own path separate from Moscow. The entirety to this conflict, from Euromaidan to Bakhmut, has occurred because the Ukrainian polity is actively choosing the ideological promise of the European Union for its own prosperity and protection. What motivates the current Ukrainian government is this ideological commitment.\n\nToo many people see this conflict as some squabble over land and security that can be solved by the simple movement of a boundary line. This is a conflict as old as Eastern Europe, which is where the dividing line between Europe and Russia is, and who is allowed to exist on which side of that line, which is why Putin's speeches about the war tend to talk about the enemy as Nazis, drag queens, and Satanists. Until someone can solve European Liberalism versus The Russkiy Mir, then there is really nothing to do but fight.",

They don\u2019t have the nuclear bargaining chip that the superpowers have so they MUST comply with them, sovereignty is not a physical state.\n\nFirst, I really don't understand your framing of \"Ukrainian demands.\" What's their demand? The respect of their sovereignty as established under international law? What is the compromise here? That Russia only bomb *some* of their electrical grid, and only kidnap and deport some children? The fact is that Russia carried out a botched decapitation strike against the very existence of the Ukrainian state itself, and now that they have failed, Kyiv has no reason to believe compromise is possible without surrending their core interests. Framing this as \"Ukrainian demands\" presupposes that Russia always had a legitimate interest in Ukrainian domestic affairs in a way that contravenes the very notion of the sovereign state. As you mention, sovereignty is not a physical state. Sovereignty is the ability to exercise exclusive and legitimate dominion over domestic affairs as a person in the international legal system. Any realist interpretation that assumes Ukraine MUST (and allcaps doesn't make it truer) cede sovereignty to Russia against its own interests is flawed.\n\nSecond, I'd challenge your assertion that Ukraine does not have nuclear security. Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons, but the global understanding right now is that the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine by Russia will be met with kinetic NATO intervention in the conflict (as an aside, it's amazing what an effective foreign affairs ministry that can actually name redlines and consequences instead of flailing about nazis and biolabs can do for de-escalation). This makes sense; if NATO allowed Russian nuclear blackmail to overcome their support of Ukraine it would have ramifications across the Strait of Formosa and set up another potential confrontation over the Baltics. So the idea that Ukraine has no counterplay to Russian nuclear weapons is dubious.\n\nThird, and more generally, you're committing the cardinal sin of realists, which is losing sight of the domestic drivers of conflict and policy. If you want to know why Ukraine fights, the current President of Ukraine literally put this in sitcom form and it's available on Netflix. The current ideological line in Kyiv is that being subsumed into the Russian sphere would amount to the loss of Ukrainian sovereignty and, more importantly, that Ukrainian culture and language would be at existential risk. The genocidal rhetoric Russia has adopted to justify this war, completely unprompted by western action, fuels this fear. A good realist would note that the incentive structure here is not to surrender, which assures destruction, but rather to fight and set the conditions to at least preserve Ukrainian sovereignty and culture in the long-term. This is true no matter howany spherical cow realists proclaim that Kyiv MUST eventually do this or that.\n\n>I agree that it\u2019s not for The West to decide on their fate but if Ukraine as a country is not mature enough  to realise that this is a disastrous political way of moving forward with its relationship with Russia then they should be MADE to accept concessions.\n\nAh, so here is the normative mumbo jumbo where you telegraph just how backwards your worldview is. Ukraine is not mature enough as a country? Are you mature enough to be making that proclamation? Have you noticed that Kyiv, for the most part, does not want a close relationship with Moscow and prefers to move towards Brussels? \n\nI don't even know what to say to \"Ukraine should be MADE to accept concessions.\" If the number one rule of realist power politics is that might makes right, then Moscow should come and take it. I'd put to you that Ukraine is \"mature\" enough as a nation to make decisions for themselves on their relationship with Russia, and we know that because Russia has been attempting to conquer Ukraine for over a year and they are no closer to their goal than they were on March 1, 2022.\n\nFurther, any hope for a future relationship between Moscow and Kyiv is dead and buried along with thousands of Ukrainians. Either Ukraine will be with Moscow at gunpoint or Europe with sovereignty. And that's easy to see unless you're being a lazy realist and your theory-of-everything equation says that Ukraine is Russia's sphere and nobody in Ukraine gets a say about that.\n\nAnd don't discount economic factors here. Russia's economy has stalled out and economic development in Russian satellite states like Belarus is abysmal. Meanwhile even the Baltic states, former SSR's like Ukraine, have already caught and surpassed Western Europe in terms of development. It doesn't take an expert to understand why Kyiv would want to move into that sphere, and why such a decision would be logical and expected of a political entity directed by democratic consensus.\n\n>Idealism NEVER works in real life hence why this article is strictly seen from the Realism point of view and in my personal opinion it covers exactly that core   discrepancy between what we are doing and what we SHOULD be doing as the elder and powerful democracies.\n\nI'd counter that Europe's 80-year experiment with liberal Pan-European ideology is pretty damn successful. You can proclaim that it NEVER works but you'll get blindsided by all the times it does. Ideology drives nearly 100% of geopolitics these days and if you don't see that after two decades of global unrest about the rise of Islamism, a dedicated anti-statist ideology that rejects basic norms of the international system, I don't know if you will ever see.\n\nI'd also like to argue that the \"elder and powerful democracies\" have charted the best course. Forcing Ukrainian concessions would encourage nuclear blackmail, justify Russia's 2014 hybrid war a legitimate method of diplomacy, and call into question the unity of the NATO-EU axis against a rising Russia-China axis. Russia's rapid and unprovoked escalation of the Donbass dispute makes confrontation inevitable, and the West has determined that it's better to draw the line in Ukraine than in Poland or Estonia. Especially considering that Russia botched the invasion and is now flailing.\n\nAlso from a realist perspective, the United States and NATO have seized an opportunity to neutralize Russia's military as a threat for decades due to degradation in Ukraine and the knock on effects of economic sanctions. Why would they not seize the opportunity?\n\nBut more than that, Ukraine's last decade has been an international competition between European liberalism and Russian realism. Ideology works when underpinned by systemic and widespread confidence by national polities. Putin's core thesis, if you care to listen to him, is that the liberal west is decadent but also hypocritical, uninterested in a serious defense of their ideals. The best way to strengthen the ideological project of liberal democracy is to prove that presumption wrong with a staunch defense of those ideals in Ukraine. \n\n>For me this concept of diplomacy is the sole purpose of having an UN security council to begin with. The war should be a 24/7 discussion between its members on how to permanently resolve the situation. We had this approach in the past centuries with The Concert of Europe, why can\u2019t we be rational for a moment and counter the irrational Russians with some carrot not just the stick?\n\nI agree, that's the purpose of the UNSC. But Russia is not without agency here (unless you would also argue that Russia is not mature enough as a nation to have agency too). Moscow violated prior treaties, sabotaged attempts at diplomacy, and continues to insist at the UNSC and elsewhere that their \"SMO\" is an internal concern and that interference from the international community is unwelcome and uninvited. The reason why we don't have this conversation is because Russia is not having it, and once it became clear that they don't want the off-ramp, it became disadvantageous for Biden, Macron, or Schulz to offer one and weaken their own position.\n\nDo you remember how the concert of Europe ended? Or the events of 1848? The supposed peace of that period was fueled by iron and blood, not just in Europe but the unfettered imperial conquest and genocide of African and Asian peoples. And between conflicts over colonies, Schleswig-Holstein, and the Balkans the period is not nearly as peaceful and calm as realists tend to assume it was. To say nothing about the ideological factors of the period that do not exist anymore; I'd argue Monarchism that invests the sovereignty of the nation in a hereditary figure instead of a popular polity is much more conducive to a system in which peace and security is guaranteed thought backroom deals that draw lines on maps. It's a big complication for realists, as you've encountered, that Ukraine's democratic process hasn't produced the \"correct\" results.\n\nBut more, I'd put the question to you. Is there a single carrot to offer the Russians that does not undermine Ukrainian sovereignty or the NATO-EU negotiating position? I don't think there is.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine expects to get everything it demands without accepting any concessions to achieve their goals. They don\u2019t have the nuclear bargaining chip that the superpowers have so they MUST comply with them, sovereignty is not a physical state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, I really don&#39;t understand your framing of &quot;Ukrainian demands.&quot; What&#39;s their demand? The respect of their sovereignty as established under international law? What is the compromise here? That Russia only bomb <em>some</em> of their electrical grid, and only kidnap and deport some children? The fact is that Russia carried out a botched decapitation strike against the very existence of the Ukrainian state itself, and now that they have failed, Kyiv has no reason to believe compromise is possible without surrending their core interests. Framing this as &quot;Ukrainian demands&quot; presupposes that Russia always had a legitimate interest in Ukrainian domestic affairs in a way that contravenes the very notion of the sovereign state. As you mention, sovereignty is not a physical state. Sovereignty is the ability to exercise exclusive and legitimate dominion over domestic affairs as a person in the international legal system. Any realist interpretation that assumes Ukraine MUST (and allcaps doesn&#39;t make it truer) cede sovereignty to Russia against its own interests is flawed.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I&#39;d challenge your assertion that Ukraine does not have nuclear security. Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons, but the global understanding right now is that the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine by Russia will be met with kinetic NATO intervention in the conflict (as an aside, it&#39;s amazing what an effective foreign affairs ministry that can actually name redlines and consequences instead of flailing about nazis and biolabs can do for de-escalation). This makes sense; if NATO allowed Russian nuclear blackmail to overcome their support of Ukraine it would have ramifications across the Strait of Formosa and set up another potential confrontation over the Baltics.

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian government recognized the borders of the new Ukraine, and further guaranteed its sovereignty in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Ukraine is a sovereign state, entitled to political independence and territorial integrity. Russia\u2019s war of aggression is clearly a violation of international law.\n\nBut the matter is more complicated than that. One of the most far-reaching consequences of Wilsonian idealism has been to turn all international conflicts into primarily legal disputes in which the key question is who is right and who is wrong. The trouble with that approach is that the strategic and historical dimensions of those conflicts tend to disappear from the policy calculus, with baleful consequences.\nHow Ukraine Became Independent\n\nThe hard truth is this: Ukraine\u2019s 1991 borders were partly a subterfuge of Soviet propaganda and did not fully make sense for an independent country alongside Russia. Containing large swaths of historical Russia, millions of ethnic Russians, and a crucial Russian naval base at Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula (which was transferred to Ukraine only in 1954 and is home to few ethnic Ukrainians even now), those borders actually guaranteed Russian hegemony in the short term. They\u2019re why pro-Russia presidential candidates won almost every election in Ukraine from 1991 until the \u201cEuromaidan\u201d revolution of 2014. Indeed, Ukrainian-nationalist parties have ruled for the past decade partly because the electorate no longer includes residents of the Donbas or Crimea, the heavily Russian areas that either broke away or were seized by Russia after the pro-Russian government was deposed in 2014.\n\nHence, from Russia\u2019s point of view, the commitments of 1991 and 1994 were mostly a formality, because Moscow expected Ukraine to remain firmly in its orbit. But those guarantees only kicked an explosive can down the road, because if a strong Ukrainian-nationalist movement should ever arise, as it has now, oriented toward Europe and bent on independence from Russia, the 1991 borders would create a fatal conflict between Ukraine\u2019s nationhood and that of the Russians, many of whom view Ukraine\u2014especially east of the Dnipro River\u2014as an inseparable part of Russia.\n\nMax Abrahms: I teach international relations. I think we\u2019re making a mistake in Ukraine.\n\nRussia may be waging a war of aggression as a matter of law, but as a matter of history and strategy it is moving to forestall a grave deterioration in its strategic position, with stakes that are almost as existential for it as they are for Ukraine. And as former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said recently, \u201cNuclear powers have never lost major conflicts on which their fate depends.\u201d\n\nWhen the U.S. agreed to recognize Ukraine in 1991, it should have realized that Ukraine\u2019s borders could prove enormously destabilizing, like the nuclear forces and Black Sea fleet that Ukraine had also accidentally inherited and which the U.S. wisely insisted be transferred to Russia in 1993\u201394.\n\nThe U.S. should have treated the 1991 borders as provisional and encouraged Russia and Ukraine to agree on a peaceful adjustment. With Europe flourishing on one side and Russia a moribund kleptocracy on the other, Ukrainians\u2019 desire for independence from Russia was almost certainly inevitable. As Ukrainian nationalism gathered strength, Russia could perhaps have been persuaded to agree to a territorial adjustment.\n\nGovernor DeSantis was right on another score: The proximate cause of the war was definitely a territorial dispute, but of a very special kind. After the Euromaidan revolution, Russia felt it had no choice but to annex Crimea, because it couldn\u2019t risk losing Sevastopol. But it still did not annex the eastern Donbas, which it was also occupying, insisting instead on its reintegration into Ukraine under the terms of the Minsk Agreements of 2014 and 2015, which it saw as vitally necessary to restoring its control over the whole of Ukraine. For the same reason, Ukraine\u2019s nationalists soured on the Minsk Agreements: With those territories in limbo, the nationalists had been able to achieve a degree of independence that would have been impossible otherwise.\nAmerica\u2019s Blank Check\n\nAs tensions mounted in 2020 and 2021, Germany and France grew anxious to persuade Ukraine to implement the Minsk Agreements, in which all the major issues were territorial. But, with their customary professions of high moral and legal principle, the Americans undercut those diplomatic efforts, encouraging the Ukrainians to dig in their heels and dare Russia to do something about it. It was an implicit blank check and had the same effect as when the kaiser wrote one a century ago, namely to entice the recipient to risk a catastrophic war with Russia.\n\nIt is crucial to understand the dangerous role that America is playing. The sheer scale of U.S. aid to Ukraine has become a decisive factor in the course of the war. Don\u2019t be deceived by President Joe Biden\u2019s claims that we are helping Ukraine without getting involved in the conflict ourselves. Even according to the Defense Department\u2019s own Law of War Manual, the U.S. is already a de facto belligerent in the Ukraine war.\n\nThe lack of strategy behind the deluge of American missiles and tanks flowing into Ukraine is frightening. The U.S. is giving Ukraine enough aid to prevent a Russian victory, but the stated aim of liberating all of Ukraine\u2019s territory, \u201cas long as it takes,\u201d isn\u2019t remotely plausible and is contradicted by other aspects of U.S. policy. This is not the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, where the Soviets could afford to cut their losses. Even a return to the status quo ante of January 2022 would likely be unacceptable to the Russians. The Russians are almost certainly prepared to lose\u2014and kill\u2014millions of people before giving up the territory they have now. And because the U.S. has thus far insisted that the weapons donated to Ukraine not be used inside Russia, U.S. strategy is currently optimized for making the war last as long as possible without a decisive result.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even if Ukraine\u2019s war aims could be achieved, what would Ukraine do then? It could either reintegrate the Russian populations and risk once again becoming a Russian puppet, or disenfranchise them through repression or wholesale expulsion, which, besides violating international humanitarian law, would likely trigger another war. Hence, Ukraine\u2019s stated war aim\u2014the complete liberation of its 1991 territory\u2014might not even be desirable from Ukraine\u2019s point of view.",

                "body": "Full Text Part 2:\n\nAmerica\u2019s Vital Interests\n\nThe overriding priority of U.S. foreign policy in the century ahead will be to tame the rising power of China. DeSantis\u2019s observation that \u201cthe Biden administration\u2019s policies have driven Russia into a de facto alliance with China\u201d is a crucial one. One might add that U.S. policy is accomplishing that quite against Moscow\u2019s will, because a brief glance at the map suffices to see that China\u2019s increasing control over its \u201cnear abroad\u201d puts it on a collision course with Russia along a roughly 6,000-mile front, if you include buffer states. In the century ahead, Russia\u2019s only alternative to domination by China is very likely an alliance with the United States, and that is an alliance the U.S. cannot afford to forfeit. Allowing Russia to slip into China\u2019s orbit would bring Chinese power into the very heart of Europe.\n\nEliot A. Cohen: The shortest path to peace\n\nTo be sure, there is a \u201crealist\u201d case for supporting Ukraine in its stated war aims. The linchpin of that argument is an analogy to 1938: If Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t stopped now, then, like Hitler, he will only try to seize more territory. That argument is creditable but misses a key difference between the two situations. In the 1930s, Czechoslovakia was the central pillar of the Allies\u2019 entire defensive strategy. It had to be defended at any price\u2014otherwise the correlation of forces would shift overwhelmingly in Germany\u2019s favor, and Hitler\u2019s conquest of Europe would become unstoppable. By contrast, even if Russia can overcome its surprising military weakness and defeat Ukraine, it will be no closer to realizing Putin\u2019s impossible dream of reincorporating the Baltic states, which, while small, are firmly under NATO\u2019s nuclear umbrella. Putin surely knows that every inch of NATO territory is hopelessly beyond his reach, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky must know that as well, his warnings to the contrary notwithstanding.\nEnding the War\n\nBefore Woodrow Wilson left his dubious stamp on international relations, wars typically ended in peace treaties. Many of those treaties involved territorial settlements, reparations, and other inducements to stop fighting.\n\nScholars have noted the vertiginous decline in peace treaties in the era of the United Nations. Part of the reason is that modern international law penalizes compromise. For example, international criminal prosecutions have gravely complicated truth-and-reconciliation processes, whose amnesties are often not recognized outside the country where they were granted. Similarly, although Putin surely knew that he was committing a war crime by invading Ukraine, the International Criminal Court\u2019s recent issuance of an arrest warrant for him can only make the stakes of the war even more apocalyptic for the Kremlin.\n\nWilsonian professions of high moral and legal principle can be an obstacle to compromise, particularly when they become inflexible policy positions. But they also represent what is best in Americans\u2019 view of themselves and of the world\u2014pacifism and benevolence tempered by the instinct to stick up for the underdog and stand up to the bully. Presidents like Ronald Reagan succeeded by finding the balance of idealism and realism, tapping into deep wellsprings of democratic sentiment to give compelling force to their realpolitik. The most important part of DeSantis\u2019s comments signaled a similar approach: \u201cWithout question, peace should be the objective.\u201d\n\nPeace should be the overriding objective now, but it will require a willingness to compromise.

DeSantis\u2019s observation that \u201cthe Biden administration\u2019s policies have driven Russia into a de facto alliance with China\u201d is a crucial one. One might add that U.S. policy is accomplishing that quite against Moscow\u2019s will, because a brief glance at the map suffices to see that China\u2019s increasing control over its \u201cnear abroad\u201d puts it on a collision course with Russia along a roughly 6,000-mile front, if you include buffer states. In the century ahead, Russia\u2019s only alternative to domination by China is very likely an alliance with the United States, and that is an alliance the U.S. cannot afford to forfeit. Allowing Russia to slip into China\u2019s orbit would bring Chinese power into the very heart of Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Eliot A. Cohen: The shortest path to peace</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, there is a \u201crealist\u201d case for supporting Ukraine in its stated war aims. The linchpin of that argument is an analogy to 1938: If Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t stopped now, then, like Hitler, he will only try to seize more territory. That argument is creditable but misses a key difference between the two situations. In the 1930s, Czechoslovakia was the central pillar of the Allies\u2019 entire defensive strategy. It had to be defended at any price\u2014otherwise the correlation of forces would shift overwhelmingly in Germany\u2019s favor, and Hitler\u2019s conquest of Europe would become unstoppable. By contrast, even if Russia can overcome its surprising military weakness and defeat Ukraine, it will be no closer to realizing Putin\u2019s impossible dream of reincorporating the Baltic states, which, while small, are firmly under NATO\u2019s nuclear umbrella. Putin surely knows that every inch of NATO territory is hopelessly beyond his reach, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky must know that as well, his warnings to the contrary notwithstanding.\nEnding the War</p>\n\n<p>Before Woodrow Wilson left his dubious stamp on international relations, wars typically ended in peace treaties. Many of those treaties involved territorial settlements, reparations, and other inducements to stop fighting.</p>\n\n<p>Scholars have noted the vertiginous decline in peace treaties in the era of the United Nations. Part of the reason is that modern international law penalizes compromise. For example, international criminal prosecutions have gravely complicated truth-and-reconciliation processes, whose amnesties are often not recognized outside the country where they were granted. Similarly, although Putin surely knew that he was committing a war crime by invading Ukraine, the International Criminal Court\u2019s recent issuance of an arrest warrant for him can only make the stakes of the war even more apocalyptic for the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>Wilsonian professions of high moral and legal principle can be an obstacle to compromise, particularly when they become inflexible policy positions. But they also represent what is best in Americans\u2019 view of themselves and of the world\u2014pacifism and benevolence tempered by the instinct to stick up for the underdog and stand up to the bully. Presidents like Ronald Reagan succeeded by finding the balance of idealism and realism, tapping into deep wellsprings of democratic sentiment to give compelling force to their realpolitik. The most important part of DeSantis\u2019s comments signaled a similar approach: \u201cWithout question, peace should be the objective.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Peace should be the overriding objective now, but it will require a willingness to compromise. As the great Cold War game theorist Thomas Schelling observed, parties to a conflict are always negotiating, even if tacitly. If we get beyond their maximalist positions to what each side really needs, a compromise may be possible.</p>\n\n<p>The 1991 borders created a painful dilemma for Ukrainian nationalists.
