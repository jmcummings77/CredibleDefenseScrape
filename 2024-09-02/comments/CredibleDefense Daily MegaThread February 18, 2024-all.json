I see no reason why they can't fix it within 6-12 months.\n \nI already mentioned this once before but\n\nnot all Ukrainians care about their state enough to sit in a trench and wait for either an FPV or an artillery shell to blow them up. Especially because if you're a young Ukrainian today you can just decide \"f*ck it, let Putin have the country, I'll just emigrate to <European country>, either through the normal route or as a refugee\". This isn't like WW2 where if you don't fight you have nowhere else to go. \n\nToday almost every single Ukrainian has seen the horrifying reality of what being a frontline soldier in this war means and a lot of them are understandably scared shitless of it. I'm reminded of \"All quiet on the western front\", where the young boys were at first very excited to go fight because all they knew about the war and the front was from propaganda on the radio and thought it would be a fun adventure. Every nationalistic Ukrainian has already signed up so you're left with a pool of men who weren't very keen on fighting in the first place, let alone now when the war is a gruesome static stalemate. \n\nPersonally because of that I highly doubt that the manpower issue can be solved even with huge signup bonuses/salaries like some folks here have suggested. Just put yourself in a 25 year old Ukrainian shoes and ask yourself \"after all I've seen, what would it take to make me go to the frontline?\"\n\n\nAs for the Russians, it's different there. \n\n* You have no choice but to go if you're summoned. Ukrainians have a wide border they can use to illegally cross into the EU and seek asylum. As a Russian your options are very limited.\n\n* Russia has A LOT of extremely poor areas with little work so men there see joining up as a calculated risk, especially with how high the bonuses/salaries are. They also don't have access to the literal terabytes of frontline footage Ukrainians have to scare them away. \n\n* Propaganda is strong within Russia. A lot of them see it as The Great Patriotic War v2. [Ekaterina Schulman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_0E9IzXT34), a Russian political scientist who left Russia just a few years ago, mentions the interesting dynamic about how mothers push their sons to go \"because it's their duty\". \n\n* Right now Russia is grabbing PR victories so more and more will be willing to sign up. The opposite goes for Ukraine.",

This isn&#39;t like WW2 where if you don&#39;t fight you have nowhere else to go. </p>\n\n<p>Today almost every single Ukrainian has seen the horrifying reality of what being a frontline soldier in this war means and a lot of them are understandably scared shitless of it. I&#39;m reminded of &quot;All quiet on the western front&quot;, where the young boys were at first very excited to go fight because all they knew about the war and the front was from propaganda on the radio and thought it would be a fun adventure. Every nationalistic Ukrainian has already signed up so you&#39;re left with a pool of men who weren&#39;t very keen on fighting in the first place, let alone now when the war is a gruesome static stalemate. </p>\n\n<p>Personally because of that I highly doubt that the manpower issue can be solved even with huge signup bonuses/salaries like some folks here have suggested. Just put yourself in a 25 year old Ukrainian shoes and ask yourself &quot;after all I&#39;ve seen, what would it take to make me go to the frontline?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As for the Russians, it&#39;s different there. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You have no choice but to go if you&#39;re summoned. Ukrainians have a wide border they can use to illegally cross into the EU and seek asylum. As a Russian your options are very limited.</p></li>\n<li><p>Russia has A LOT of extremely poor areas with little work so men there see joining up as a calculated risk, especially with how high the bonuses/salaries are. They also don&#39;t have access to the literal terabytes of frontline footage Ukrainians have to scare them away. </p></li>\n<li><p>Propaganda is strong within Russia. A lot of them see it as The Great Patriotic War v2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_0E9IzXT34\">Ekaterina Schulman</a>, a Russian political scientist who left Russia just a few years ago, mentions the interesting dynamic about how mothers push their sons to go &quot;because it&#39;s their duty&quot;. </p></li>\n<li><p>Right now Russia is grabbing PR victories so more and more will be willing to sign up. The opposite goes for Ukraine.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

There is truly no way to spin this. </p>\n\n<p>I think worst case for him he will turn this into another Afghanistan and prolong it for so long that the people get tired and start asking to leave which he can use as a convenient off-ramp.</p>\n</div>",

Gen. Michael Loh told reporters Tuesday at the Air & Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium.\n\n>The U.S. is training 12 Ukrainian pilots in fiscal 2024\u2014all of whom are set to graduate between May and August, according to Arizona National Guard spokesperson Capt. Erin Hannigan.\n\n> The pilots are already \u201cflying F-16s solo every day,\u201d but the requirements for these pilots have changed and training is taking a bit longer because the pilots need to be able to operate a \u201cfull range of missions\u201d beyond wartime scenarios, Loh said. \n\n>However, the U.S. won\u2019t be able to keep this effort going and train more pilots beyond the first cohort if Congress doesn\u2019t authorize more funding.\n\nAdditionally, Sweden continues to reaffirm its willingness to discuss the Gripens with Ukraine if they can achieve NATO accession (note that this doesn\u2019t mean a deal is purely contingent on the latter):\n\n>[Swedish minister reaffirms willingness to send jets to Ukraine after finalizing NATO bid](https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-minister-open-to-jets-for-ukraine-once-sweden-enters-nato/)\n\n\n> Sweden is open to providing Ukraine with modern fighter jets, but the Nordic country first needs a full-fledged NATO membership, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson told the Kyiv Independent during an interview on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 16.\n\n>As Ukraine seeks to bolster its Air Force with modern Western jets, Ukrainian officials have shown interest in Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen aircraft. Stockholm has previously said it would consider supplying Gripens to Ukraine only once the Nordic country enters NATO.\n\n>\"For us to make a decision, we have to be full-fledged members of NATO and be part of Article 5. This is also a decision that has to be done in collaboration with others,\" Jonson told a Kyiv Independent reporter.\n\n>\"Ukraine needs fourth-generation and fifth-generation fighter aircraft. If we, one way or another, can help you (Ukraine), we are open to that,\" the minister said.\n\nLastly, the latest on where Hungary is regarding Sweden form the NYT:\n\n\n>[Hungary Snubs U.S. Senators Pushing for Sweden\u2019s Entry Into NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/world/europe/hungary-us-senators-nato-sweden.html)\n\n> Hungary, the last holdout blocking Sweden\u2019s entry into NATO, thumbed its nose over the weekend at the United States, declining to meet with a bipartisan delegation of senators who had come to press the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban to swiftly approve the Nordic nation\u2019s entry into the military alliance.\n\n>The snub, which Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, described on Sunday as \u201cstrange and concerning,\u201d represented the latest effort by Mr. Orban, a stalwart champion of national sovereignty, to show he will not submit to outside pressure over NATO\u2019s long-stalled expansion.\n\n> Speaking a day earlier in Budapest, Hungary\u2019s capital, Mr. Orban restated his previous commitment \u2014 so far reneged on \u2014 to let Sweden into the alliance as soon as possible. \u201cWe are on course to ratify Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO at the beginning of Parliament\u2019s spring session,\u201d he said.\n\n>Mr. Orban, whose party has a large majority in Parliament and controls when it meets and how it votes, gave no date, but legislators are expected to reconvene at the end of the month after a winter break. Fidesz legislators boycotted a session of Parliament called earlier this month by the opposition to ratify Sweden\u2019s NATO membership.\n\n>After more than 18 months of foot-dragging, Hungary has come under intense pressure from the United States and other members of the 31-nation alliance to accept Sweden, whose military is far bigger and more sophisticated than that of Hungary.",

Erin Hannigan.</p>\n\n<p>The pilots are already \u201cflying F-16s solo every day,\u201d but the requirements for these pilots have changed and training is taking a bit longer because the pilots need to be able to operate a \u201cfull range of missions\u201d beyond wartime scenarios, Loh said. </p>\n\n<p>However, the U.S. won\u2019t be able to keep this effort going and train more pilots beyond the first cohort if Congress doesn\u2019t authorize more funding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, Sweden continues to reaffirm its willingness to discuss the Gripens with Ukraine if they can achieve NATO accession (note that this doesn\u2019t mean a deal is purely contingent on the latter):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/swedish-minister-open-to-jets-for-ukraine-once-sweden-enters-nato/\">Swedish minister reaffirms willingness to send jets to Ukraine after finalizing NATO bid</a></p>\n\n<p>Sweden is open to providing Ukraine with modern fighter jets, but the Nordic country first needs a full-fledged NATO membership, Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson told the Kyiv Independent during an interview on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 16.</p>\n\n<p>As Ukraine seeks to bolster its Air Force with modern Western jets, Ukrainian officials have shown interest in Swedish-made Saab JAS 39 Gripen aircraft. Stockholm has previously said it would consider supplying Gripens to Ukraine only once the Nordic country enters NATO.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;For us to make a decision, we have to be full-fledged members of NATO and be part of Article 5. This is also a decision that has to be done in collaboration with others,&quot; Jonson told a Kyiv Independent reporter.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ukraine needs fourth-generation and fifth-generation fighter aircraft. If we, one way or another, can help you (Ukraine), we are open to that,&quot; the minister said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lastly, the latest on where Hungary is regarding Sweden form the NYT:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/world/europe/hungary-us-senators-nato-sweden.html\">Hungary Snubs U.S. Senators Pushing for Sweden\u2019s Entry Into NATO</a></p>\n\n<p>Hungary, the last holdout blocking Sweden\u2019s entry into NATO, thumbed its nose over the weekend at the United States, declining to meet with a bipartisan delegation of senators who had come to press the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban to swiftly approve the Nordic nation\u2019s entry into the military alliance.</p>\n\n<p>The snub, which Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, described on Sunday as \u201cstrange and concerning,\u201d represented the latest effort by Mr. Orban, a stalwart champion of national sovereignty, to show he will not submit to outside pressure over NATO\u2019s long-stalled expansion.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking a day earlier in Budapest, Hungary\u2019s capital, Mr. Orban restated his previous commitment \u2014 so far reneged on \u2014 to let Sweden into the alliance as soon as possible. \u201cWe are on course to ratify Sweden\u2019s accession to NATO at the beginning of Parliament\u2019s spring session,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Orban, whose party has a large majority in Parliament and controls when it meets and how it votes, gave no date, but legislators are expected to reconvene at the end of the month after a winter break. Fidesz legislators boycotted a session of Parliament called earlier this month by the opposition to ratify Sweden\u2019s NATO membership.</p>\n\n<p>After more than 18 months of foot-dragging, Hungary has come under intense pressure from the United States and other members of the 31-nation alliance to accept Sweden, whose military is far bigger and more sophisticated than that of Hungary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It seems Patriot is doing a lot of the most spectacular work now, particularly the (one) highly mobile battery given to them by Germany. This is likely because S-300 and BUK shots are on the decline. What that means, who can say. Perhaps S-300 is now being used in an anti-missile role, perhaps the stocks are genuinely at or near zero. BUK, on the other hand, is likely still playing a more important role as western missiles have been integrated into the launchers with apparently some success. Which missiles, I again dont know. And then of course you have the unsung heroes like the SA-8 providing tactical air coverage, and Igla/Stinger providing MANPAD coverage. Its very probable these weapons remain plentiful but also that they fundamentally lack the range and targeting capabilities to provide effective tactical AD. \n\nBut its also clear that IRIS-T, NASAM, HAWK, and Gepard are doing a HUGE amount of work these days in all tiers of Ukraine's AD network. These weapons provide a day-to-day shootdown capability that Ukraine can constantly replenish from western stocks. Again, we dont know what % of missiles fired are from the missile systems, or what targets theyre shooting at. We know Gepards are mainly used in defense of static positions, probably HAWK as well in an anti-drone/Saheed role. IRIS has been used in at least some missile shoot downs, IIRC so has NASAM. \n\nThe problem for Ukraine remains having plentiful AD in the tactical role. They probably need a good number of systems which are highly mobile and can operate in that 10-20mi zone which was what the BUK covered. Something a bit shorter and more flexible than an S-300/Patriot, but with a longer reach than the SA-8 or -9. This zone is where the KA-52s liked to operate during the summer offensive (too close, low, and slow for long range AD, but too far and fast for something like an SA-9 mounting a Strela MANPAD system). At the outer limit, a 20-30mi range would also hurt the ability of RUAF aircraft to deliver accurate glide bombs, to some of them have a pretty significant range. If you could combine LRAD with MRAD (that is, an S-300-type system with a BUK-type system) there might be a way to counter glide bomb attacks. AD is a persistent issue though, not just for Ukraine but for most of the west. Not only that, but Patriot aside the west is like right in the middle of a major generational shift from older AD to newer and so system numbers overall are lower. \n\nI personally wonder if something might be done with South Korea to get some of their newer AD systems. They have recently completed their own buildup of a new AD platform, and now seems like a good moment to try and shift from domestic production to export-focused. But if it were that easy it would have already been done, the Korean MIC clearly is exported minded and would love some of those sweet sweet Ukraine dollars.",

This are inherently good venues for money laundering and the inorganic way that this pop up all around Europe, usually in huge commercial spaces is suggestive of a connection to the Chinese mafia. There are also many burning questions regarding the import and distribution of this Chinese goods into Europe. </p>\n\n<p>Recently, there&#39;s been a very inorganic surge of huge 200+ seats) Chinese buffets all around Europe as well, usually with lavish (although tacky) architecture and very similar branding and offerings. Needless to say, those are also prime venues for money laundering.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the obvious fact that the Chinese mafia is responsible for a significant part of production and distribution of narcotics in Europe, their presence presents additional risk for Europe as their well stabilized infrastructure and networks can be used by the Chinese police apparatus for repression of Chinese and foreign nationals overseas.</p>\n</div>",

Let's start with what I think are the Russian and Ukrainian short-term goals.\n\n**Russia**: The Russian short-term goal is most likely to continue applying pressure along the front to inflict sufficient casualties upon Ukraine to aggravate its acute manpower crisis. However, while all sectors are very likely to be instructed to (continue to) apply pressure, Russia will probably choose one axis for its main effort.\n\n**Ukraine**: Their short-term goal is to maintain the defensive integrity of the front while suffering as few casualties as possible. In other words, defend until the manpower issue is at least somewhat resolved. This is probably their mid-term goal, too, since the first serious influx of manpower cannot occur before summer's end even if the problem is resolved now. In the meantime, Ukraine will maintain morale with highly visible strikes on Russia's prestige targets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Russia's next main target**\n\nIdeally, Russia would want an objective that is Avdiivka 2.0 - a place Ukraine has to defend, which has a significant propaganda value and is already in a bad operational situation (semi-encircled or with bad access roads). All this *within the depth of 10km*, which is the maximum the Russian army can hope to advance in one operation. Unsurprisingly, such ideal places are few and Russia will have to settle for a compromise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing north to south clockwise:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Belarus-Ukraine and Russia-Ukraine border*\n\nUnlikely to be reactivated for multiple logistics and strategic reasons before 2025. It is not impossible that a local attack from Russia along the Oskil river might be attempted but the axis is unpromising. (2 out of 10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Kupyansk direction*\n\nA relatively promising direction. The Ukrainian transport across Oskil could be disrupted, and the front is close to Russia but at the end of the Ukrainian logistical tether. The problem is there is little worth fighting for on the eastern bank of Oskil and nothing to prevent Ukraine from withdrawing across the river once it inflicts enough losses. (5 out of 10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Siversk bulge*\n\nEasier for Ukraine to supply than Kupyanks. Contains nothing of particular significance. Taking it at least brings the Russians closer to Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, their likely goals in 2025. (4 out of 10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Chasiv Yar - Konstantinivka*\n\nImpossible to encircle, impossible to disrupt Ukraine's supply. However, the direction is strategically important as it leads deeper into the Donetsk oblast and the southern flank of the Slavyansk-Kramatorsk line. (6 out of 10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Zaporozhye*\n\nNothing of significance within the 10km advance limit.
