As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The second article details new armored vehicles that Ukraine is producing and currently supplying to its forces.\n\n[Russians Doubled Drones on Front Line in Past 3 Months \u2013 Ukrainian Pravda | Kyiv Post | April 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/31658)\n\n*Over the past three months, the Russians have at least doubled the number of drones they\u2019re using on the Russo-Ukrainian front line, [Ukrainian Pravda (UP)](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2024/04/25/7452816/) reported Thursday, April 25.

The parliament has recently passed a new law on mobilisation, which lowers the age at which men can be called up from 27 to 25.*  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>*On Wednesday, the foreign ministry announced that it would suspend consular services for men subject to the draft who were living abroad. There were angry scenes at consular offices and agencies in Poland later in the day, where men who had booked appointments to pick up documents were told they could not do so.*  \n>  \n>  \n*Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the Guardian on Wednesday that it was unacceptable for Ukrainian men outside the country to \u201csit down in restaurants\u201d while others were dying, and said the move was partly about demonstrating fairness to those who were at the front. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand why the government is not trying to bring more people into the war effort,\u201d he said.*  \n>  \n>*Thousands of men are believed to have crossed Ukraine\u2019s western borders illegally since the war began, sometimes paying bribes to make it across. However, many other Ukrainian men have lived outside the country for years. Some returned after the war started, but many have lives and families outside the country and do not wish to return. There are also many Ukrainian men in Europe from war-torn eastern areas of the country who left their homes via Russia in the early stages of the war as it was the only way out.*  \n>  \n>  \n*Igor Lisin, vice-president of Foundation Ukraine, an organisation working with Ukrainians in Poland, said that while there were no official figures for how many men of military age were currently living outside the country, as a \u201cvery rough estimate\u201d he believed about 300,000-400,000 were currently in Poland.*  \n>  \n>  \n*Tadeusz Ko\u0142odziej, a lawyer with the Ocalenie Foundation, a Polish NGO, said there was no mechanism by which Polish authorities could deport Ukrainian men to Ukraine, and no current plans to declare their presence in the country illegal.*  \n>  \n>  \n*But the Polish parliament is due to consider new regulations next week that would require all Ukrainians to show a valid passport to be able to access benefits in Poland. Previously, Ukrainian refugees had been able to do so by showing any other documents proving their identity.*  \n>  \n>  \n*\u201cThe draft text we have seen would cut around 80% of benefits for people without passports,\u201d Ko\u0142odziej said. In time, there may also be questions about whether people without a passport can work legally. \u201cIf it will be impossible to get a passport, many of these people may ask for asylum,\u201d Ko\u0142odziej added.*  \n>  \n>*Exactly how the new regulations will work may not be clear until the new law on mobilisation comes into force in mid-May. It is possible that men will be able to update their records in the military register using an app from outside the country, rather than returning home to do so.*  \n>  \n>  \n*\u201cOf course, they want people to come back, but there is no legal instrument to force them,\u201d said Lisin. However, he said the recent messaging had caused stress and fear among many in Poland\u2019s Ukrainian community, partly because of the uncertainty over how it would work in practice. \u201cThe less people know, the more people fear,\u201d he said.*  \n>  \n>  \n*Poland drew plaudits for the way it opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees in the first months of the war and the Polish government remains one of Ukraine\u2019s most vocal backers in the EU. However, there has been evidence of increasing \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d in Polish society as the war drags on. Protests by Polish truckers over transit access for their Ukrainian counterparts blocked the border between the two countries for several weeks, while surveys show attitudes to Ukrainian refugees are becoming gradually less welcoming.*  \n>  \n>  \n*\u201cI think many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine,\u201d said Kosiniak-Kamysz.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is the chance of this happening? And what views do you have on this, over on r/worldnews people are not happy, not that their takes are credible but their thoughts might say something about how people in Ukraine feel about this.",

However, many other Ukrainian men have lived outside the country for years. Some returned after the war started, but many have lives and families outside the country and do not wish to return. There are also many Ukrainian men in Europe from war-torn eastern areas of the country who left their homes via Russia in the early stages of the war as it was the only way out.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>Igor Lisin, vice-president of Foundation Ukraine, an organisation working with Ukrainians in Poland, said that while there were no official figures for how many men of military age were currently living outside the country, as a \u201cvery rough estimate\u201d he believed about 300,000-400,000 were currently in Poland.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>Tadeusz Ko\u0142odziej, a lawyer with the Ocalenie Foundation, a Polish NGO, said there was no mechanism by which Polish authorities could deport Ukrainian men to Ukraine, and no current plans to declare their presence in the country illegal.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>But the Polish parliament is due to consider new regulations next week that would require all Ukrainians to show a valid passport to be able to access benefits in Poland. Previously, Ukrainian refugees had been able to do so by showing any other documents proving their identity.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe draft text we have seen would cut around 80% of benefits for people without passports,\u201d Ko\u0142odziej said. In time, there may also be questions about whether people without a passport can work legally. \u201cIf it will be impossible to get a passport, many of these people may ask for asylum,\u201d Ko\u0142odziej added.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>Exactly how the new regulations will work may not be clear until the new law on mobilisation comes into force in mid-May. It is possible that men will be able to update their records in the military register using an app from outside the country, rather than returning home to do so.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cOf course, they want people to come back, but there is no legal instrument to force them,\u201d said Lisin. However, he said the recent messaging had caused stress and fear among many in Poland\u2019s Ukrainian community, partly because of the uncertainty over how it would work in practice. \u201cThe less people know, the more people fear,\u201d he said.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>Poland drew plaudits for the way it opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees in the first months of the war and the Polish government remains one of Ukraine\u2019s most vocal backers in the EU. However, there has been evidence of increasing \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d in Polish society as the war drags on. Protests by Polish truckers over transit access for their Ukrainian counterparts blocked the border between the two countries for several weeks, while surveys show attitudes to Ukrainian refugees are becoming gradually less welcoming.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cI think many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine,\u201d said Kosiniak-Kamysz.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What is the chance of this happening? And what views do you have on this, over on <a href=\"/r/worldnews\">r/worldnews</a> people are not happy, not that their takes are credible but their thoughts might say something about how people in Ukraine feel about this.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "An article that gives details about the UAF under Syrsky's command.  It expands on the changes in how UAF leadership is reacting to certain situations (like the 67th).  It gives also gives some specific numbers on drone production and Russian losses to drones.  \n\n[The Syrsky War: Ukraine\u2019s Supreme Commander Is Betting on Drones, Patience and Discipline | Kyiv Post | April 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/31637)\n\n*Three months after General Syrsky took overall command Ukraine\u2019s soldiers are still fighting backfooted, hitting Russia with fierce losses but losing ground. That may be the plan.*\n\n*Ukraine\u2019s strategy of military counterpunching and making the Kremlin pay in blood for every meter gained seems to have become less crisis management, and more the basic structure of the Syrsky plan.*\n\n*An ethnic Russian with a background in artillery, and old enough (59) to have fought in Afghanistan for the Soviet Union back in the 1980s, General Oleksander Syrsky on Feb. 8 took over the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) under siege. He replaced Valery Zaluzhny, a general popular with troops and the public.*\n\n*Artillery ammunition had run catastrophically short. Russia had total air superiority. Defeat was staring Syrsky in the face, particularly, in the battleground city of Avdiivka, where battered Ukrainian troops have struggled to hold positions against relentless Russian attacks.*\n\n*At the same time, relations between the AFU leadership and President Volodymyr Zelensky had, if not broken down, been badly damaged by news reports that Zaluzhny was possibly considering a run for the Presidency. For the past year, Zelensky\u2019s office had been bypassing Zaluzhny and issuing orders to about half the forces the AFU had in the field.*\n\n*Fast forward 85 days and Oleksander Syrsky has already made some military history. He commands the first military, ever, that is not just waging a conventional ground war with drones \u2013 rather than tanks or artillery or bombs \u2013 but also a fighting organization that has turned robot aircraft carrying explosives into the main weapon used to kill and wound the enemy and destroy his equipment. In past major wars artillery and mortar shells have dominated the battlefield and have typically been responsible for 80-90 percent of losses.*\n\n*In the first quarter of 2024, according to statements by Syrsky\u2019s command group, first-hand accounts by drone operators to Kyiv Post reporters, and an April 9 article in the Foreign Policy journal, fully two-thirds of the Russian tanks lost to the Kremlin, in recent months, were put out of action by drones. According to Russian POW accounts, every second Russian soldier wounded or killed in combat in Ukraine, at least, was targeted and hit by a Ukrainian drone.*\n\n*According to Zelensky\u2019s office, Ukrainian engineers and volunteers working in garages and underground factories are assembling an astounding 60-80,000 cheap FPV drones a month. In some veteran AFU brigades like the elite 36th Marines and the Kyiv-raised 3rd Assault, for every two battalions of infantry the formation fields, now a full battalion of drone operators also is in the field.*\n\n*Syrsky in March threw the 3rd Assault into a spoiling attack around Avdiivka to push Russian forces back temporarily and allow another, badly damaged brigade to break contact and avoid encirclement. Then Syrsky pulled the 3rd Brigade back and Russian forces captured the city and declared a victory. The fight was tough, but drone swarms and infantry did the job.*\n\n*It was one of the first times in nearly nine months the AFU had launched an entire brigade into combat, and then managed to extricate it, to preserve another fighting formation.*\n\n*Discipline in less well-commanded units has, on Syrsky\u2019s watch, become a staff focus, and sometimes previously untouchable heads have rolled. According to reports first published by the major Ukrainian news magazine Ukrainska Pravda, in early April portions of the 67th Brigade \u2013 a unit formed mostly from politically connected fighters from the nationalist Right Sektor group \u2013 abandoned positions in the Chasiv Yar sector under heavy Russian pressure.*\n\n*This posed Syrsky and his staff with a typical AFU command problem: By AFU common practice neither the soldiers nor commanders would be held accountable because they all were patriotic volunteers, and the AFU was chronically short of troops.*\n\n*Confronting politically influential volunteers in a way Zaluzhny never did, Syrsky dissolved the brigade without further ado. In peacetime, the decision might have triggered angry protests in the capital. In April 2024, the 67th was stricken from AFU unit rolls and the war went on.*\n\n*Russian military observers are reporting the AFU they face now seems laser-focused on waiting for the right moment to pile up Russian bodies and cares less about holding ground. The pro-Kremlin milblogger Vault 8 in an April 14 post, citing combat information from the front, wrote:*\n\n*\u201cThe [Ukrainians] leave a position then they start hitting it with everything possible. Between battles, they don\u2019t shoot much at all and that gives the impression they have nothing to shoot with. But if we come out and attack one of their positions everything pours down, from 120mm [mortars] to 155mm [NATO-standard howitzers]. And many FPV drones \u2013 from two to four attack each of our soldiers, to get a sure kill. And when the [Ukrainians] observe us trying to pull back, they counterattack immediately, to recover what they lost.\u201d*\n\n*Syrsky in an extensive March 29 interview with the state Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform said that his goal with maximum drone use is not just to reduce Ukrainian casualties but to cut troop numbers needed on the front lines, and to gain breathing space so soldiers sometimes serving on the front lines for two years can get rest and leave.*\n\n*The Russian air threat, although not defeated, has been degraded significantly, Syrsky said in a March 29 interview with the state-run Ukrinform news agency. Taking a calculated risk of placing air defense weapons along the front line at an unexpected site able to attack Russian aircraft paid dividends, AFU missile operators shot down 13 Russian planes in a matter of days including a pair of irreplaceable A-50 AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) surveillance and air command and control planes, he said.*\n\n*A longer-term goal, Syrsky said, is to change the shape of military planning from something like a fire brigade racing from crisis to crisis, to a professional organization where a chain of command functions and fighting efficiency is the priority. Higher echelons of the AFU will see replacements by combat-experienced officers, he said.*\n\n*\u201cIn some cases, when the commander is not in control of the situation, and the actions and commands directly pose a threat to the life and health of subordinates, I am forced to make personnel decisions,\u201d Syrsky said in part.*\n\n*In early April comments, Syrsky estimated that Russian artillery firepower is likely to outgun Ukraine\u2019s by six to one for months to come notwithstanding Western commitments to deliver shells. Russian air strikes will continue until Ukraine gets real air defenses or an effective air force of its own. Syrsky said his objective until summer at least is to rebuild the AFU, induct thousands of new soldiers, give veterans a chance to rest and take leave, and train the lot.*\n\n*In the official policy interview on AFU policy and plans, Syrsky never used the word \u201cvictory\u201d \u2013 not even once.*\n\n*Zelensky named Zaluzhny Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Britain on Monday.*",

            "body": ">Just curious how hardware is valued when giving it to Ukraine. \n\nThe bookkeeping on the value of donations to Ukraine is a weirdly touchy subject and has already been the subject of internal audits. And, of course, it varies by what the legal mechanism of donation was. USAID (United States Agency for International Development), PDA (Presidential Drawdown Authority), or a specific piece of legislation.\n\nUSAID isn't really relevant to retired military gear, so we'll focus on the others.\n\nPDA, as I understand it, uses the price when new of the item delivered. So if some hypothetical M60s were found in a warehouse, they would be valued at $480k to $1.2m, depending on variant.\n\nSome Congressional aid packages have extended the PDA's usual $100m/yr (for all countries) but only for Ukraine. These would follow the PDA accounting.\n\nOther Congressional aid packages instead do things like authorizing sending an old hypothetical M60 and funding purchase of a brand new one. These kind of packages seem to have better support as it means that a bigger percentage of the dollar value of the package is spent in the US to replace the hardware. They also imply a bigger donation than reality, since the US sends a used, older model, bit of hardware and buys are new, modern, replacement.\n\nedit: (continuing answering the sub-questions)\n\n>Doesn't USA have old obsolete hardware that arguably has no value (to America)? Might be a poor example but something like the m60 tank, can't we just give Ukraine all of them for free and not even count it?\n\nThat is the gist of why so many M113s and HMMWVs have been sent. However, the catch is that stuff that is that obsolete also is old. The US may have 1000's of M113s sitting out in the desert, but it is an open question about how many still run.

Also, in theory, the US will save money in the long run because it doesn't have to keep maintaining these stockpiles of old vehicles.\n\nOn the other hand, the stockpiles are there in case things turn badly for the US. So there is a non-monetary cost to the US in reducing its readiness for crisis that might happen to the US.\n\n>Or maybe old hardware is worse than no hardware.\n\nFor most purposes, yes.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Just curious how hardware is valued when giving it to Ukraine. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The bookkeeping on the value of donations to Ukraine is a weirdly touchy subject and has already been the subject of internal audits. And, of course, it varies by what the legal mechanism of donation was. USAID (United States Agency for International Development), PDA (Presidential Drawdown Authority), or a specific piece of legislation.</p>\n\n<p>USAID isn&#39;t really relevant to retired military gear, so we&#39;ll focus on the others.</p>\n\n<p>PDA, as I understand it, uses the price when new of the item delivered. So if some hypothetical M60s were found in a warehouse, they would be valued at $480k to $1.2m, depending on variant.</p>\n\n<p>Some Congressional aid packages have extended the PDA&#39;s usual $100m/yr (for all countries) but only for Ukraine. These would follow the PDA accounting.</p>\n\n<p>Other Congressional aid packages instead do things like authorizing sending an old hypothetical M60 and funding purchase of a brand new one. These kind of packages seem to have better support as it means that a bigger percentage of the dollar value of the package is spent in the US to replace the hardware. They also imply a bigger donation than reality, since the US sends a used, older model, bit of hardware and buys are new, modern, replacement.</p>\n\n<p>edit: (continuing answering the sub-questions)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Doesn&#39;t USA have old obsolete hardware that arguably has no value (to America)?

Its a non NATO neighbouring country that was (other than Belarus) the one most firmly inside Russian sphere of influence in the post Soviet years and the one with , by far, the most cultural/ethnic/linguistic overlap with Russia proper. Based on the latter it had notable ,boardering to Russia, regions with strong if not dominant \"Russian-friendly\" elements that allowed either for straight up non violent anexation (Crimea) or the initiation of viable low-mid intensity civil war against the Ukrainian state for years up until the invasion (given Russian material support). And a big,chaotic and controversial globaly and regionaly within Ukraine political crisis that gave immense opportunity to kickstart those processes and involvement with minimized geopolitical risks at the time. Those regions also are  relatively rewarding to annex from a geopolitical, geographical and even natural resource perspective.\n\nGiven those realities, risk reward assessments and Russian self percieved military prowess before the invasion it was neither crazy nor suicidal for them to invade for what they precieved as achievable non maximalist goals (annexing those 3-4 oblasts, forcing a Russian friendly puppet government and demilitarization onto the rest of Ukraine).

Sending a million Russian soldiers in conflcts involving tens of thousands of stationed US and NATO troops and hardware from day one in order to do what? occupy Poland or Finland or the Baltics?

The Russian Invasion of Ukraine, no matter how horrible, surprising or in hindsight a long term mistake for Russia did and does have real material and geopolitical realities, conviniencies and historical development leading up to it and had a risk-reward ratio, goals and military feasibility that doesnt require a \"Putin wants to become rulling Tsar of all of eastern europe\" type analysis to explain.",
