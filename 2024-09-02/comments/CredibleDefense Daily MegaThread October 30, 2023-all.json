Two variants of these improvised air defenses \u2014 one pairing Soviet Buk launchers and American Sea Sparrow missiles, the other marrying Soviet-era radars and American Sidewinder missiles \u2014 have been tested over the past several months on military bases in the United States and are set to be delivered to Ukraine this fall, officials said.\nA third, the Cold War-era Hawk missile system, was displayed on Ukraine\u2019s battlefield this week for the first time, in an example of what Laura K. Cooper, a senior U.S. defense official, had described this month as a FrankenSAM \u201cin terms of resurrection\u201d \u2014 an air defense relic brought back to life.\n\n>Together, the FrankenSAMs are \u201ccontributing to filling critical gaps in Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, and this is the most important challenge that Ukraine faces today,\u201d said Ms. Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia policy.\n\n>Almost since the start of the war, Ukraine has tinkered with commingling offensive weapons \u2014 its aging Soviet-era stockpiles and the ones it has gotten from the West \u2014 in unexpected but, in many cases, successful ways. American military officials spoke admiringly last year of Ukraine\u2019s ability to \u201cMacGyver\u201d its arsenal, a metaphor for the 1980s TV show in which the title character uses simple, improvised contraptions to get himself out of sticky situations.\n\n> The FrankenSAMs project is now trying to do the same for Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.\n\n>Over the past 20 months, the West has supplied a range of air defenses to Ukraine, including state-of-the-art Patriot and IRIS-T systems, tanks fitted with antiaircraft guns and more than 2,000 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles.\n\n>This past week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany announced that his government would provide Ukraine with three more batteries of sophisticated air defenses, including another Patriot system, as part of what he called a nearly $1.5 billion \u201cwinter package.\u201d\n\u201cAs winter approaches, we are putting up a protective shield against renewed Russian attacks on energy, water and heating infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Scholz said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is because it is becoming apparent that Russia will once again use cold and energy shortages as a weapon against the civilian population.\u201d\n\n>The air defenses are part of the close to $100 billion in military aid that Ukraine has received from allies since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The United States, which has already sent more funding for weapons than any other single nation, is considering donating $60 billon more as part of a new Biden administration emergency spending plan.\n\n>On Thursday, the administration announced another $150 million in military aid for Ukraine, a package of weapons that included additional munitions for three kinds of air defense systems \u2014 including Sidewinder missiles for one of the FrankenSAMS.\n\n>Now that it has Western tanks, armored vehicles, air defenses and long-range attack missiles in its arsenal, and with fighter jets on the way, officials said Ukraine largely needs more of the same weapons it has already received as opposed to systems that have yet to be sent.\n\n>FrankenSAMs are a mix of both. The program\u2019s origins date to late last year, when Ukrainian officials asked the allies to help them find missiles for around 60 Soviet-era Buk launchers and radars that were sitting idle in Kyiv\u2019s arsenal. Knowing it would be difficult for the West to obtain Russian-manufactured munitions to fit the Buk systems, the Ukrainians instead suggested refitting the launchers to use NATO-caliber antiaircraft missiles donated by the United States.\n\n>\u201cWe realized we needed to come up with some solutions,\u201d said Oleksandra Ustinova, the chairwoman of a commission in Ukraine\u2019s Parliament that oversees arms transfers from the West. She said Ukrainian officials offered to jury-rig the weapons themselves, in the interest of time, \u201cbecause for the winter period we need desperately the air defenses, and this is what is going to be used.\u201d\n\n>But American engineers insisted on doing the work, and they needed more than seven months to test and approve the mash-up after the Pentagon agreed in January to provide Sea Sparrow missiles for the project. The first few refurbished Buk launchers and missiles arrived in Ukraine only recently, Ms. Ustinova said.\n\n>She said Ukraine was prepared to send 17 more Buk launchers to the United States to be refitted, but American engineers had been able to turn around only five each month.\n\n>Ukraine has also had to wait for the older Hawk systems to get up and running after they were initially pledged by Spain in October 2022. A month later, the United States said it would pay to refurbish older Hawk missiles for the donated Spanish systems. But at least some of them were delivered to Ukraine without the necessary radar equipment. That took another nine months to arrive.\n\n\n>By Monday night, the Hawks were fully operational, shooting down targets alongside more modern air-defense systems, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s air forces, Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk, said on Telegram. Hitting 100 percent of the targets \u201cis not easy, but we will get closer to it every day, strengthening our air defense,\u201d General Oleshchuk wrote.\n\n>Another creation \u2014 an improvised ground launcher that uses Soviet-era radars to fire old American missiles that are usually used on fighter jets \u2014 was revealed in tandem with a $200 million security assistance package that the Pentagon announced on Oct. 11.\n\n>That FrankenSAM uses American-made supersonic AIM-9M Sidewinder missiles, which were developed in the 1950s and are used on F-16 and F-18 fighter jets. They are now part of the improvised ground-launching system, which Ms. Cooper previewed in Brussels as \u201ca real innovation\u201d that she said would help speed air defenses to Ukraine, \u201cinstead of it being, you know, years and years of development time.\u201d It is not clear precisely when it will arrive in Ukraine.\nAmerican defense officials and engineers are also still testing what may be the most powerful FrankenSAM yet: a Patriot missile and launching station that operates with Ukraine\u2019s older, domestically made radar systems.\n\n>A Pentagon official said on Wednesday that a test flight of the system this month, conducted at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, successfully hit the drone it had targeted. The system is scheduled to be sent to Ukraine this winter, the official said, accompanied by donated missiles and other Patriot parts from multiple allies.\n\n>Can Kasapoglu, a defense analyst for the Hudson Institute in Washington, praised the idea of integrating the Soviet-era equipment with more sophisticated Western missiles as a way to help Ukraine \u201cmaintain its arsenal for the long war ahead.\u201d\nIt also \u201cprovides an opportunity to put weapons that are collecting dust on NATO capitals\u2019 shelves,\u201d Mr. Kasapoglu said, \u201cinto practical use.\u201d",

It does apply to a wide range of topics and those include security and national defense.  \n\nIt builds on [voluntary commitments the White House previously secured](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/21/white-house-secures-voluntary-pledges-from-microsoft-google-on-ai.html) from leading AI companies and represents the first major binding government action on the technology. It also comes ahead of the an [AI safety summit hosted by the U.K](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-introduction/ai-safety-summit-introduction-html) and a couple months after the Pentagon [launched a generative AI taskforce](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2023/08/defense-department-just-launched-generative-ai-task-force/389298/).\n\n[White House unveils executive order on AI safety, competition | Defense One | October 2023](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2023/10/white-house-unveils-executive-order-ai-safety-competition/391599/)\n\n*The order lays out some basic safety rules to prevent AI-enabled consumer fraud, requires red-team testing of AI software for safety, and issues guidance on privacy protections. The White House will also pursue new multilateral agreements on AI safety with partner nations and accelerate AI adoption within the government, according to a fact sheet provided to reporters.*\n\n*The order comes amid growing public concern about the effects of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence tools on public life, the future of employment, education, and more. Those concerns are at odds with warnings from key business leaders and others that China\u2019s growing investment in AI could give it an economic, technological, and military advantage in the coming decades. The new executive order attempts to address concerns about the use of AI in dangerous settings and the misuse of AI while simultaneously encouraging its advancement and adoption.*\n\n*White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed called the order \u201cthe next step in an aggressive strategy to do everything on all fronts to harness the benefits of AI and mitigate the risks.\u201d*\n\n*On safety, the order directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, to draft standards for red-team exercises to test the safety of AI tools before they\u2019re released.*\n\n*\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security will apply those standards to critical infrastructure sectors and establish the AI Safety and Security Board. The Departments of Energy and Homeland Security will also address AI systems\u2019 threats to critical infrastructure, as well as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks,\u201d according to the White House fact sheet.*\n\n*The order also stands up a new cyber security program to explore how AI could lead to attacks, requires that the developers of \u201cthe most powerful AI systems\u201d share safety test results with the government, and it calls on the Department of Commerce to develop practices for detecting AI-generated content that could be used for fraud or disinformation.*\n\n*It calls on the National Science Foundation to further develop cryptographic tools and other technologies to protect personal and private data that could be collected by AI tools, and it sets guidelines to prevent organizations and institutions from using AI in discriminatory ways. It also calls on the government to do more research on AI\u2019s effects on the labor force.*\n\n*Additionally, a large portion of the order looks at how the government can better embrace AI and form new bonds and working strategies with like-minded democratic nations to do so.*\n\n*\u201cThe administration has already consulted widely on AI governance frameworks over the past several months\u2014engaging with Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE, and the UK,\u201d the fact sheet said. The order calls on the State and Commerce departments to \u201clead an effort to establish robust international frameworks for harnessing AI\u2019s benefits and managing its risks and ensuring safety.\u201d*\n\n*Still, according to the fact sheet, \u201cMore action will be required, and the administration will continue to work with Congress to pursue bipartisan legislation to help America lead the way in responsible innovation.\u201d*",

Those concerns are at odds with warnings from key business leaders and others that China\u2019s growing investment in AI could give it an economic, technological, and military advantage in the coming decades. The new executive order attempts to address concerns about the use of AI in dangerous settings and the misuse of AI while simultaneously encouraging its advancement and adoption.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed called the order \u201cthe next step in an aggressive strategy to do everything on all fronts to harness the benefits of AI and mitigate the risks.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>On safety, the order directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, to draft standards for red-team exercises to test the safety of AI tools before they\u2019re released.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe Department of Homeland Security will apply those standards to critical infrastructure sectors and establish the AI Safety and Security Board. The Departments of Energy and Homeland Security will also address AI systems\u2019 threats to critical infrastructure, as well as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks,\u201d according to the White House fact sheet.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The order also stands up a new cyber security program to explore how AI could lead to attacks, requires that the developers of \u201cthe most powerful AI systems\u201d share safety test results with the government, and it calls on the Department of Commerce to develop practices for detecting AI-generated content that could be used for fraud or disinformation.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It calls on the National Science Foundation to further develop cryptographic tools and other technologies to protect personal and private data that could be collected by AI tools, and it sets guidelines to prevent organizations and institutions from using AI in discriminatory ways. It also calls on the government to do more research on AI\u2019s effects on the labor force.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Additionally, a large portion of the order looks at how the government can better embrace AI and form new bonds and working strategies with like-minded democratic nations to do so.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe administration has already consulted widely on AI governance frameworks over the past several months\u2014engaging with Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE, and the UK,\u201d the fact sheet said. The order calls on the State and Commerce departments to \u201clead an effort to establish robust international frameworks for harnessing AI\u2019s benefits and managing its risks and ensuring safety.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Still, according to the fact sheet, \u201cMore action will be required, and the administration will continue to work with Congress to pursue bipartisan legislation to help America lead the way in responsible innovation.\u201d</em></p>\n</div>",

Israeli strikes have already killed more than 7,000 Palestinians in the enclave, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to get bogged down there without achieving our goal of dismantling Hamas,\u201d says Naftali Bennett, who served a one-year stint as prime minister until June 2022.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

At some point, though, supplies will run out: a lack of fuel for generators would mean no fresh air or lights underground, which would force Hamas to surface. \u201cHamas doesn\u2019t expect this at all. It expects a ground invasion for three to six weeks,\u201d Mr Bennett argues.\n\n> Israel\u2019s tactics are constrained already by the more than 220 hostages abducted on October 7th by Hamas and other factions. Their families have put pressure on the Israeli government to prioritise their release. So have foreign governments: at least 41 countries have citizens in captivity (around a quarter of the hostages are thought to be migrant farm workers from Thailand). Hamas has released just four women thus far. There are ongoing talks, mostly via Qatar, the Gulf state which is one of Hamas\u2019s patrons, to free more.\n\n>\nOne Israeli official says the limited size of the ground campaign is an effort to balance competing priorities: to show that Israel is prepared to attack, while leaving room for a hostage deal. Still, even the incursion on October 27th was enough to anger the families. They called it \u201cthe worst of all nights\u201d in a statement the next morning, which bemoaned the \u201ccomplete uncertainty regarding the fate of the abductees who are being held there and are also subject to the heavy bombardment\u201d.\n\n> The presence of so many Palestinian civilians is another constraint. On October 13th the idf told the residents of northern Gaza, more than 1m people, to flee south. Around two-thirds of the civilian population is thought to have heeded that order\u2014which still leaves a vast number of people in the area Israel is encircling. The mobile-phone outage during the October 27th bombardment made it impossible to call ambulances. Witnesses in Gaza say people brought the dead and wounded to hospitals on tuk-tuks.\n\n> Even in the \u201csafe\u201d zone, conditions are intolerable. Israel has continued air strikes in the south (though they are less intense than those in the north). It has not allowed any supplies to enter Gaza via its border. Aid began to trickle across from Egypt on October 21st, after Israel lifted a veto on the deliveries, but it is woefully inadequate. Just 84 lorries of food, water and medicine have entered in the past week; the United Nations says 100 lorries a day are needed.\n\n> Israel still refuses to allow fuel into Gaza. The idf said this week that Hamas\u2019s underground headquarters is located beneath Shifa hospital, Gaza\u2019s largest, and that the same generators which provide electricity for medical treatment also power ventilation systems and communication networks in the tunnels below (Hamas denies these claims). For Israel, then, the blockade on fuel is a military necessity.\n\n> For civilians, though, it is a source of growing misery. Gaza\u2019s sole power station shut down on October 11th. Overcrowded hospitals rely on generators for electricity (several have run out of fuel). There are hours-long queues for meagre supplies of bread at the few bakeries that still have fuel for their ovens. Israeli politicians insist they will not send any aid to Gaza until all of the hostages are freed. Army officials have begun to acknowledge this position is untenable, saying a prolonged war will require them to oversee a humanitarian effort.\n\n> On October 27th the un General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution that called for an immediate \u201chumanitarian truce\u201d. The vote was 120-14, with 45 abstentions. America, which rejects any talk of a ceasefire, was one of the \u201cno\u201d votes. \u201cWe\u2019re not drawing red lines for Israel,\u201d said John Kirby, a White House spokesman, on October 27th. Still, it has started pushing Israel for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d, temporary lulls that would allow more aid to enter and let people with foreign citizenship leave Gaza through Egypt. Josep Borrell, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, has also endorsed the idea.\n\n> Army officials also hope a more gradual war will keep other fronts quiet. Iran continues to make threats\u2014and not only to Israel. \u201cIf the us continues what it has been doing so far, then new fronts will be opened up against the us,\u201d said Hossein Amirabdollahian, the foreign minister, in an interview with Bloomberg on October 27th. Iranian-backed militias have already carried out at least 19 drone or missile attacks against American bases in Syria and Iraq. On October 26th the Pentagon said it had conducted retaliatory air strikes against Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (irgc) in Syria.\n\n> None of this is unusual, however. Those militias have been attacking American bases for years, although such attacks had subsided since March with an undeclared truce linked to prisoner-swap talks between America and Iran. The events of the past few weeks are a reversion to the norm, in other words, not a major escalation.\n\n> Worries about a second front in northern Israel have also subsided. In the days after the Hamas attack Israel called up 360,000 reservists, many of whom were sent to reinforce the border with Lebanon amid fears of a similar assault by Hizbullah, the Shia militant group and political party. Though tensions remain high, Israel believes Hizbullah and Iran, its patron, are wary of broadening the conflict. Both Israeli and Arab officials say Hizbullah has suffered more casualties than expected\u2014it admits around 50 of its militants have been killed so far\u2014and may be reassessing its tactics. The Israeli army may consider sending home some of its reservists, whose mobilisation is a heavy burden on the economy.\n\n> A slower war, coupled with a serious effort to provide humanitarian aid, could ease some of the pressure on Israel. But it would not solve the strategic dilemma of how to uproot Hamas or what to replace it with\u2014questions which Israeli officials admit they have yet to answer. And it is little comfort to civilians in Gaza, who would be fated to endure months of displacement and despair. \u25a0",

        "body": "Here is a recently published article by TIME on the challenges Zelensky is currently facing: \"\u2018Nobody Believes in Our Victory Like I Do.\u2019 Inside Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s Struggle to Keep Ukraine in the Fight\"\n\nLink: [https://time.com/6329188/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-interview/](https://time.com/6329188/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-interview/)\n\nImportant points:\n\n**Waning Support for Ukraine:**\n\n**Public support for aid to Ukraine has been in decline for months in the U.S., and Zelensky\u2019s visit did nothing to revive it.** Some 41% of Americans want Congress to provide more weapons to Kyiv, down from 65% in June, when Ukraine began a major counteroffensive, according to a Reuters survey taken shortly after Zelensky\u2019s departure. That offensive has proceeded at an excruciating pace and with enormous losses, making it ever more difficult for Zelensky to convince partners that victory is around the corner. With the outbreak of war in Israel, even keeping the world\u2019s attention on Ukraine has become a major challenge.\n\nThis time around, the atmosphere had changed. Assistance to Ukraine had become a sticking point in the debate over the federal budget. One of Zelensky\u2019s foreign policy advisers urged him to call off the trip in September, warning that the atmosphere was too fraught. Congressional leaders declined to let Zelensky deliver a public address on Capitol Hill. His aides tried to arrange an in-person appearance for him on Fox News and an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Neither one came through.\n\nInstead, on the morning of Sept. 21, Zelensky met in private with then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy before making his way to the Old Senate Chamber, where lawmakers grilled him behind closed doors. Most of Zelensky\u2019s usual critics stayed silent in the session; Senator Ted Cruz strolled in more than 20 minutes late. The Democrats, for their part, wanted to understand where the war was headed, and how badly Ukraine needed U.S. support. \u201cThey asked me straight up: If we don\u2019t give you the aid, what happens?\u201d Zelensky recalls. \u201cWhat happens is we will lose.\u201d\n\nThe usual sparkle of his optimism, his sense of humor, his tendency to liven up a meeting in the war room with a bit of banter or a bawdy joke, none of that has survived into the second year of all-out war. \u201cNow he walks in, gets the updates, gives the orders, and walks out,\u201d says one longtime member of his team. Another tells me that, most of all, **Zelensky feels betrayed by his Western allies. They have left him without the means to win the war, only the means to survive it.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Zelensky's convictions:**\n\nBut his convictions haven\u2019t changed. Despite the recent setbacks on the battlefield, he does not intend to give up fighting or to sue for any kind of peace. On the contrary, **his belief in Ukraine\u2019s ultimate victory over Russia has hardened into a form that worries some of his advisers. It is immovable, verging on the messianic.** \u201cHe deludes himself,\u201d one of his closest aides tells me in frustration. \u201cWe\u2019re out of options. We\u2019re not winning. But try telling him that.\n\n\u201dZelensky\u2019s stubbornness, some of his aides say, has hurt their team\u2019s efforts to come up with a new strategy, a new message. As they have debated the future of the war, **one issue has remained taboo: the possibility of negotiating a peace deal with the Russians**. Judging by recent surveys, most Ukrainians would reject such a move, especially if it entailed the loss of any occupied territory.\n\n**Zelensky remains dead set against even a temporary truce.** \u201cFor us it would mean leaving this wound open for future generations,\u201d the President tells me. \u201cMaybe it will calm some people down inside our country, and outside, at least those who want to wrap things up at any price. But for me, that\u2019s a problem, because we are left with this explosive force. We only delay its detonation.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**On the issue of conscription:**\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not moving forward,\u201d says one of Zelensky\u2019s close aides. **Some front-line commanders, he continues, have begun refusing orders to advance, even when they came directly from the office of the President.** \u201cThey just want to sit in the trenches and hold the line,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can\u2019t win a war that way.\u201d\n\nIn some branches of the military, the shortage of personnel has become even more dire than the deficit in arms and ammunition. One of Zelensky\u2019s close aides tells me that even if the U.S. and its allies come through with all the weapons they have pledged, \u201cwe don\u2019t have the men to use them.\u201d\n\nSince the start of the invasion, Ukraine has refused to release official counts of dead and wounded. But according to U.S. and European estimates, the toll has long surpassed 100,000 on each side of the war. It has eroded the ranks of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces so badly that draft offices have been forced to call up ever older personnel, raising the average age of a soldier in Ukraine to around 43 years. \u201cThey\u2019re grown men now, and they aren\u2019t that healthy to begin with,\u201d says the close aide to Zelensky. \u201cThis is Ukraine. Not Scandinavia.\u201d\n\n**Now recruitment is way down.** As conscription efforts have intensified around the country, stories are spreading on social media of draft officers pulling men off trains and buses and sending them to the front. Those with means sometimes bribe their way out of service, often by paying for a medical exemption. Such episodes of corruption within the recruitment system became so widespread by the end of the summer that on Aug. 11 Zelensky fired the heads of the draft offices in every region of the country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**On the issue of corruption:**\n\nIn recent months, the issue of corruption has strained Zelensky\u2019s relationship with many of his allies. Ahead of his visit to Washington, the White House prepared a list of anti-corruption reforms for the Ukrainians to undertake. One of the aides who traveled with Zelensky to the U.S. told me these proposals targeted the very top of the state hierarchy. \u201cThese were not suggestions,\u201d says another presidential adviser. \u201cThese were conditions.\u201d\n\nAmid all the pressure to root out corruption, I assumed, perhaps naively, that officials in Ukraine would think twice before taking a bribe or pocketing state funds. But when I made this point to a top presidential adviser in early October, he asked me to turn off my audio recorder so he could speak more freely. \u201cSimon, you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d he says\\*.\\* **\u201cPeople are stealing like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u201d**\n\nAs news of these scandals spread, the President gave strict orders for his staff to avoid the slightest perception of self-enrichment. \u201cDon\u2019t buy anything. Don\u2019t take any vacations. Just sit at your desk, be quiet, and work,\u201d one staffer says in characterizing these directives. **Some midlevel officials in the administration complained to me of bureaucratic paralysis and low morale as the scrutiny of their work intensified.**\n\nWhen I asked Zelensky about the problem, he acknowledged its gravity and the threat it poses to Ukraine\u2019s morale and its relationships with foreign partners. Fighting corruption, he assured me, is among his top priorities. **He also suggested that** **some foreign allies have an incentive to exaggerate the problem**, because it gives them an excuse to cut off financial support. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he says, \u201cfor them to cover up their failure to help Ukraine by tossing out these accusations.\u201d\n\n**But some of the accusations have been hard to deny**. In August, a Ukrainian news outlet known for investigating graft, Bihus.info, published a damning report about Zelensky\u2019s top adviser on economic and energy policy, Rostyslav Shurma. The report revealed that Shurma, a former executive in the energy industry, has a brother who co-owns two solar-energy companies with power plants in southern Ukraine. Even after the Russians occupied that part of the country, cutting it off from the Ukrainian power grid, the companies continued to receive state payments for producing electricity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies for such a long summary, but the article itself is long and goes over quite a bit. I recommend reading it for yourself as it offers some rare insight on how top Ukrainian leadership perceive the war.",

Fighting corruption, he assured me, is among his top priorities. <strong>He also suggested that</strong> <strong>some foreign allies have an incentive to exaggerate the problem</strong>, because it gives them an excuse to cut off financial support. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he says, \u201cfor them to cover up their failure to help Ukraine by tossing out these accusations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>But some of the accusations have been hard to deny</strong>. In August, a Ukrainian news outlet known for investigating graft, Bihus.info, published a damning report about Zelensky\u2019s top adviser on economic and energy policy, Rostyslav Shurma. The report revealed that Shurma, a former executive in the energy industry, has a brother who co-owns two solar-energy companies with power plants in southern Ukraine. Even after the Russians occupied that part of the country, cutting it off from the Ukrainian power grid, the companies continued to receive state payments for producing electricity.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Apologies for such a long summary, but the article itself is long and goes over quite a bit.

Yet, Russia not only has no real free press, but it's also been illegally detaining the few Western journalists that do dare to travel there.\n\n[Kurmasheva's ](https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-court-extends-detention-us-journalist-dec-5-2023-10-23/) detention has been extended and [Gershkovich's](https://apnews.com/article/evan-gershkovich-russia-appeal-9ea3f342d8969319a46fe6b92115915c) court proceedings are nothing but a farce. What this means is that while structural issues are laid bare in Ukraine, the country that would like to capture it, is not only substantially worse but has become adept at hiding it. Take for example the anecdote of wanting to fire the general in charge of the counteroffensive. Seems imminently reasonable even if a bit sensationalized. Yet, Russia has had a veritable revolving door of leaders throughout the war, with the only consistent faces belonging to two highly incompetent holdovers who are only retained due to their fealty to the emperor. Just over the weekend, two more generals were removed from their posts. \n\nSimilarly, while there are major issues with graft, there's been detailed reporting that they seem to be at least somewhat committed to making systemic changes. But corruption is endemic, and it takes years to eradicate foundationally. It's not going to happen overnight. The U.S. can still experience episodic periods of [major graft](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/biggest-fraud-generation-looting-covid-relief-program-known-ppp-n1279664). However, if one were to look at even Russia's private sector (let alone the completely divorced from reality public sector,) and the inherent corruption within the edifice, where every major corporation is owned by an oligarch who has to pledge loyalty to Putin over the state or risk excommunication, it's very inherently clear that these two systems are not equivalent today.",

Many officials oversee industries or manage government services that very directly affect their close relatives. The government provides services to everyone, so it's literally inevitable that such connections will occur. I mean, just think about it. The Director of the EPA has many relatives that drive cars and breathe air. That doesn't preclude them from overseeing the regulation of vehicle emissions. You can extend that same logic to literally every government function. So even if the embezzlement charges are valid and Shurma is himself implicated, that would not mean it is generally a problem for people to hold government office with powers that could affect their families' business. Yet Shuster slyly presents it as a foregone conclusion that it *should* trouble Shurma that he oversees an industry his brother works in.\n\nIt doesn't help that the embezzlement charges really do smack of trumped up political mudslinging. It seems like a valid subsidy payment that was just on auto-deposit and no one in the government thought to cancel it when the solar plants were cut from the grid. Maybe the company should have proactively returned the money, but it seems like a really thin charge with only an extremely indirect connection to Shurma himself, even if his brother did something shady. Yet Shuster leaps to the assumption that the investigation will reflect negatively on Shurma and almost scoffs at the idea that it's just political mudslinging.\n\nWorse yet, he is so naive he utterly fails to recognize what Shurma meant when he said, \u201cIf we do that, tomorrow everybody on the team would be targeted. Politics is back, and that\u2019s the problem.\u201d With corruption so rife in Ukraine, political opponents of the administration can tie any given government official indirectly to corruption via their families and personal connections with comparable allegations. If the administration acts on such weak information as soon as someone slings dirt, they will be flooded with spurious claims designed to paralyze the administration. Thus, Zelensky and his staff will wait until an official investigation shows some guilt or complicity before removing Shurma, and likely will adopt the same policy for other officials facing similar weakly substantiated allegations.\n\nAnd there are other stupidities I don't have the time to go into, but crap like this:\n\n> The cold will also make military advances more difficult, locking down the front lines at least until the spring. But Zelensky has refused to accept that. \n\nShuster just concludes, entirely on his own, with no citation to a credible defense analyst (which he decidedly is not), that winter will freeze the lines and that Zelensky is wrong. Shuster is dishonestly presenting his own opinion as if it is indisputable fact. \n\nBottom line, the guy is a terrible journalist and he is just doing someone's (I'm sensing Arestovich's grimy little paws behind some of these anonymous quotes) political dirty work by trying to paint Zelensky as the main obstacle to peace.",

Sinwar is accutely aware that Hamas as a government is hurting its standing as a militant group. Hamas is aware that it is likely not popular in Gaza, and more popular where it does not rule (in the West Bank). Sinwar has been exploring two tracks: (1) a \"Hudna\" (long-term truce) with Israel that would allow more investment in Gaza or even (2) a return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. Option (2) is what I would call a \"Hezbollah\" scenario, in which Hamas relinquishes civilian control of Gaza, but keeps its military capabilities.

Hamas (obviously) refused. After October 7, Abbas and the PA have conditioned any return to Gaza to the resumption of a peace process. The PA knows that it is unpopular, and that going back to Gaza is risky. It won't do it if Israel does not recommit to peace. In Israel, Netanyahu has participated greatly in marginalizing Abbas, and many people view Abbas as complicit. This is the wrong policy, one that led us to where we are.

In some form or another practically all Western leaders, as well as NATO, vowed that Ukraine must win this, or alternatively Russia lose, or at least not being allowed to succeed. They've nailed themselves. Dropping Ukraine now like a hot potato would be tantamount to admitting Western defeat to Russia. Impossible. Outrageous. Even more so given what has been invested, not to mention the costs in human life and well-being, destruction, that could've been reduced on a tremendous scale by surrendering (sic) to Russia's \"conditions\" just earlier. Or right away. If you're a Western government this is the one route you can't go. And I don't have another explanation for why we keep Ukraine caught up in our own lies and self-deception, and let the dying just continue. Right in Europe. Miserable, pointless deaths in the multi-thousands, seas of blood, no end, no hope, no way out. One of the most devastating, tragic situations, also historically I believe, is when a defeated side just couldn't admit it.

We can no longer defeat Russia; as we're unwilling, if indeed capable, to pay what Russia is willing to sacrifice. Even half-intelligent people, as you put it, saw this coming for a long time, as always basic arithmetics paid off. But it's not about sounding better or nicer. This isn't a beauty contest, something you could just talk yourself out of. We're talking overthrow of the North Atlantic/Euro security order and of political certainties of a near century, we're talking defeat.\n\nI guess the \"thinkers\" you're alluding to are basically the same people (left/right populists) who were rooting for Russia's case all along, though with very disparate motivations. No wonder they're seeing their light now. It'll be one of the sad ironies of this war that those who were wrong in the beginning end up with the arguments on their side. Only because we botched it in the meantime, big time.\n\nI'm with you also on Israel, only in that case the smug calls for ceasefire are even cheaper since there's really no one on the other side who could assert significant demands.

I get the feeling the Russian border isn't mined much at all, judging by the success of the Russian separatist attacks into Russia proper prior to the counteroffensive. It likely would've seen less success than I would've hoped, given the lack of coordination we've seen with the Ukrainian offensive brigades, but it would've likely resulted in one hell of a disruption of Russian lines. And perhaps serious territory being exchanged.\n\nAttacking south into Zaporizhzhia was the highest risk, but highest reward. It was a gamble, but it was a mistake. I think they banked on Russian mobiks pissing themselves and fleeing in terror. It's weird that Ukraine didn't understand Russia's culture of resigned misery. You'd think they'd be familiar with it.\n\nAnother aspect is that I think the West did demand some operational-level.success in exchange for aid. That's the rumbling we've been hearing under the surface for quite some time, and I think there's more truth to it than we'd like to admit. The West offered remarkably anemic support while requesting lofty results. Taking some farmland in the steppes of Luhansk wouldn't exactly change the calculus of the war, but it would've certainly been more successful than Zaporizhzhia. And Ukraine needed another morale win. But I think the West wouldn't have seen that sort of offensive as being worth investing in, or perhaps that was the perception of the Ukrainians. Who knows.\n\nI'm less pessimistic about things than others here. Wars ebb and flow. Sometimes it's hard to see a path forward, but then it emerges. No one really had Kharkiv on their radar prior to it happening. I remember being highly skeptical in Summer 2022 that Ukraine could pull off any offensive at all, but they did. This war hasn't even hit the two year mark. World War II lasted for six years. If Ukraine can somehow rekindle its fighting spirit and re-inspire its allies, I think they have a lot more fight left in them.

It was a puff piece written very early in the war. Unfortunately it wasn't true. \n\nThere are some sources of evidence that Zelensky was involved in tactical decision making since the very beginning of the war, [like this](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-i-told-ukrainian-defenders-of-mariupol-they-can-leave-the-city-they-refused/), where he admitted he was giving permission to units to retreat from Mariupol (which he claims was ignored).

Foreign countries seem more unwilling to help than last year, and most except the US seem to run out of actual things to give.

I can't speak to Russian banking, but in a lot of Western banking institutions a fixed term loan requires that you have a reason for borrowing. By comparison, a credit card is just a general line of credit, which is why they are often treated differently.

No one showed up. No one protected us. And we, innocent civilians, civilians who pay taxes to the State of Israel, are in captivity under horrible conditions.\n\n\"You are killing us,\" she continued. \"You want to kill us all? Do you want to use the IDF to kill us? Have you not slaughtered enough [people]?\"\n\nShe also said to \"let their people go. Let their prisoners go\"\u2014referring to Hamas.\n\nThis message echoed the sentiments expressed by Hamas.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a senior Hamas official told NBC News that they would release all civilian hostages in exchange for a cessation of IDF strikes on the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, in various statements and interviews, Hamas has articulated its intention to secure the release of all its prisoners in return for the hostages.\nWeighing 'the fate of the kidnapped'\n\nIn 2011, Israel released 1,027 prisoners in exchange for a single Israeli soldier, Gilad Schalit, which included Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre. Hamas likely anticipates a similar outcome this time.\n\n\"Maybe someone held a gun to her head or someone else's head.

Gaunt and exhausted, the recently released hostage told the press she had received medical care and food while in captivity.\n\nWhile Lifshitz spoke from Tel Aviv, her husband remained in captivity, and one can only imagine the anxiety she felt, knowing that Hamas held her husband. In such a distressing situation, every word Lifshitz uttered had to be considered in that context.\n\nAs counterterrorism expert Lt.-Col. (res.) Dr. Anat Berko said, \"Even if they did not threaten her with words, she knows they have her husband.\"\n\nAnd Lifshitz is well aware that Hamas is closely monitoring her actions.\n\nAccording to Yotam, Monday's video is unlikely to be the last of its kind.\n\nWhat will the content of the following video be?\n\nThat will likely depend on the internal and external pressure Hamas faces.",

House Republicans want to only pass Israel funding and offset its cost by dollar for dollar defunding the IRS (most hill observers and some Senate Republicans note this would increase the deficit by reducing tax revenue). In contrast, the minority leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell wants to pass every dollar. \n\nThe general rule in DC is that the party who is in the minority is losing, and after that the party that is divided is losing. Republicans are both of those in each chamber. Add to this the shaky leadership situation in the House - whatever your opinion of Mike Johnson is, he is not a leader with a reputation (or fundraising capacity) on par with Mitch McConnell. One example of House division is that conservatives like Joe Wilson (famous for yelling \u201cyou lie\u201d during Obama\u2019s State of the Union\u201d has [signed on to a letter to neither delink or offset aid](https://x.com/AndrewSolender/status/1719157192048120235?s=20). Wilson is no moderate, and this is telling how out on a limb the days-old House Speaker is on the issue. \n\nIn a sane world one would predict that the House GOP are going to have to swallow the full aid package because events, public opinion, and the political balance of power more or less demand it. That said, the House GOP is in a weak position precisely because they (collectively) are not sane, and it is hard to predict what their actions would be. I could see this going through by discharge petition - in which a small number of Republicans cross over with all Dems to fund aid. Conservative reps like Joe Wilson saying aid shouldn\u2019t be decoupled or offset is a huge indicator for the success of this effort. That said, House Republicans could also see this as a dangerous moment for their new Speaker and decide his tenuous power is more important than Israel or Ukraine and ride against public opinion and the rest of DC. They would do a lot of damage to themselves and their fundraising prospects (they need Johnson to be hitting the phone with donors, not picking a fight with Senate Republicans), but they seem oblivious to the idea of external pressure. \n\nSo long answer is aid will probably pass much closer to the Senate\u2019s framework than the House\u2019s. But at the same time anyone should be reticent to make predictions about House GOP behavior. They are deep in unusual and unprecedented behavior. A Speaker has never been removed the way McCarthy has. \n\nTo watch which way the wind is blowing, either more Republicans will indicate that Israel aid should not be a messaging bill (ie impossible to pass but signals coalition values), or they will declare that any effort to pressure Speaker Johnson to change course is a betrayal of the caucus. Right now the former group is ascendant.",

If at that point NATO responded, and Russia actually started moving troops into offensive postures inside a NATO country and war was declared:\n\nIt would most likely look like Russia losing all bases outside of Russia, losing its naval fleet unless in port, and then Russia threatening nuclear annihilation if any NATO troops cross the border. \n\nI imagine NATO would undergo a conventional bombing campaign and ground offensive on Russian troops within the invaded NATO country, and probably also within occupied Ukraine.

I asked it this question:\n\n\"Can you give me an overview of the strategies, tactic, systems, platforms used by NATO countries to engage in a combined arms breaching operation of heavily fortified static defensive lines\"\n\nThe answer for the brief overview:\n\n>Certainly! Combined arms breaching operations are complex and require the synchronization of multiple assets to ensure success. NATO countries have a range of strategies, tactics, and systems in their arsenals to address such challenges. Here's a brief overview:\n\n>1. **Strategies and Doctrine**:\n   - **Combined Arms Maneuver**: This involves the synchronized and simultaneous application of various arms (infantry, armor, artillery, engineers, and aviation) to exploit enemy weaknesses.\n   - **Decentralized Execution**: Senior commanders provide intent and end-state objectives, but decentralized execution allows junior leaders to make decisions on-the-fly based on their assessment of the situation.\n\n>2. **Tactics**:\n   - **Obscuration**: Smoke, usually generated by artillery or smoke generators, is used to blind enemy observers and weapon systems.\n   - **Suppression**: Artillery, mortars, and close air support can be employed to suppress or neutralize enemy defensive positions, especially anti-tank and machine gun emplacements.\n   - **Secure a Foothold**: This usually involves infantry, supported by armor, establishing a position inside the enemy defensive line which can then be exploited.\n   - **Follow-on Forces**: Once a breach has been secured, reserve forces move through the breach to exploit the gap and pursue deeper objectives.\n\n>3. **Systems and Platforms**:\n   - **Main Battle Tanks (MBTs)**: Such as the M1 Abrams or Leopard 2, provide direct fire support.\n   - **Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs)**: Like the Bradley or Puma, support infantry and can provide suppressive fire.\n   - **Combat Engineering Vehicles**: These vehicles, such as the U.S. M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle or the German Leopard 2-based Kodiak, are equipped to clear mines, obstacles, and even lay down a temporary road or bridge.\n   - **Artillery Systems**: Such as the M109 Paladin or the Panzerhaubitze 2000, deliver suppressive and destructive fire.\n   - **Attack Helicopters**: Like the AH-64 Apache, can provide reconnaissance, target acquisition, and direct fire support.\n   - **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**: These provide real-time intelligence and reconnaissance.\n\n>4. **Other Considerations**:\n   - **Electronic Warfare (EW)**: Jamming enemy communications, sensors, and detonating IEDs remotely.\n   - **Cyber Operations**: Disrupting enemy networks and systems.\n   - **Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)**: Gathering information on enemy positions, strength, and intent, often using satellites, drones, or special operations forces.\n   - **Counter-IED Techniques**: Various tactics and tools to detect and neutralize improvised explosive devices.\n\n>5. **Joint & Multinational Operations**: \n   - NATO operations involve cooperation between multiple nations and often multiple branches of service (e.g., army, navy, air force). This demands intricate coordination, communication, and planning to ensure everyone is aligned in purpose and action.\n\n>6. **Training and Rehearsals**: \n   - Breaching operations are complex and dangerous. Regular, realistic training and detailed rehearsals are critical to ensure every element understands its role and can execute under pressure.\n\n>Keep in mind that this is a generalized overview. The specifics of a combined arms breaching operation would be dictated by the unique circumstances of the battlefield, the capabilities and intentions of the enemy, the available forces, and other strategic and tactical considerations. Additionally, with technological advancements, new systems and tactics continue to emerge that could be integrated into such operations.",
