      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

On top of that, the Ukrainian war reporter Andriy Tsaplienko gave the names of the allegedly deceased (Tsaplienko/31711).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At approximately one o&#39;clock today, the Ukrainians struck the location of the occupiers in the village of Klishchiivka.</p>\n\n<p>Enemy casualties: Colonel Makarenko, commander of the 4th OMSR, Colonel Mazur, Chief of Staff of the 4th OMSR, Colonel Tretyak, deputy commander of the 2nd Army Corps from the MPZ, call sign &quot;Leader&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>There is also information that in Klishchiivka, the 2nd battalion of the 124th OMSR demanded that the brigade commander personally lead them into position, and he died during the shelling.</p>\n\n<p>Wounded deputy commander of the 4th omsbr with the call sign &quot;Yastrub&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given that the colonels named by the Russian and Ukrainian sources are completely different, either Tsaplienko has gotten their names wrong, or there are even more dead colonels than those disclosed.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Some more Discord leaks published in the WP about Zelensky, alleging he has been much more hawkish in private over military strategy than his public statements might suggest, although a caveat is that it's not clear how serious some of his proposals were.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/05/13/zelensky-ukraine-war-leaked-documents/\n\n>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has won the trust of Western governments by refusing to use the weapons they provide for attacks inside Russia and prioritizing the targeting of Russian forces inside Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\n>But behind closed doors, Ukraine\u2019s leader has proposed going in a more audacious direction \u2014 **occupying Russian villages to gain leverage over Moscow, bombing a pipeline that transfers Russian oil to Hungary, a NATO member, and privately pining for long-range missiles to hit targets inside Russia\u2019s borders**, according to classified U.S. intelligence documents detailing his internal communications with top aides and military leaders.\n\n>The documents, which have not been previously disclosed, are part of a broader leak of U.S. secrets circulated on the Discord messaging platform and obtained by The Washington Post. They reveal a leader with aggressive instincts that sharply contrast with his public-facing image as the calm and stoic statesman weathering Russia\u2019s brutal onslaught. The insights were gleaned through intercepted digital communications, providing a rare look at Zelensky\u2019s deliberations amid Russian missile barrages, infrastructure attacks and war crimes.\n\n>The Pentagon, where senior U.S. military leaders were briefed on the matters outlined in the leaked documents, did not dispute the authenticity of the materials.\n\n>In some cases, Zelensky is seen restraining the ambitions of his subordinates; in several others, he is the one proposing risky military actions.\n\n>In a meeting in late January, **Zelensky suggested Ukraine \u201cconduct strikes in Russia\u201d while moving Ukrainian ground troops into enemy territory to \u201coccupy unspecified Russian border cities,\u201d according to one document labeled \u201ctop secret.\u201d The goal would be \u201cto give Kyiv leverage in talks with Moscow,\u201d** the document said.\n\n>In a separate meeting in late February with Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander, Zelensky \u201cexpressed concern\u201d that \u201cUkraine does not have long-range missiles capable of reaching Russian troop deployments in Russia nor anything with which to attack them.\u201d **Zelensky then \u201csuggested that Ukraine attack unspecified deployment locations in Rostov,\u201d a region in western Russia, using drones instead,** according to another classified document.\n\n>In a meeting in mid-February with Deputy Prime Minister Yuliya Svrydenko, **Zelensky suggested Ukraine \u201cblow up\u201d the Soviet-built Druzhba pipeline that provides oil to Hungary. \u201cZelenskyy highlighted that \u2026 Ukraine should just blow up the pipeline and destroy likely Hungarian [Prime Minister] Viktor Orban\u2019s industry, which is based heavily on Russian oil,\u201d** the document says.\n\n>In detailing the conversation, **intelligence officials concede that Zelensky was \u201cexpressing rage toward Hungary and therefore could be making hyperbolic, meaningless threats,\u201d** a qualification that does not accompany the other accounts of Zelensky suggesting bold military action. Though Hungary is nominally part of the Western alliance, Orban is widely considered Europe\u2019s most Kremlin-friendly leader.\n\n>When asked if he had suggested occupying parts of Russia, Zelensky, during an interview with The Post in Kyiv, dismissed the U.S. intelligence claims as \u201cfantasies\u201d but defended his right to use unconventional tactics in the defense of his country.\n\n>\u201cUkraine has every right to protect itself, and we are doing it. Ukraine did not occupy anyone, but vice versa,\u201d Zelensky said. \n>\u201cWhen so many people have died and there have been mass graves and our people have been tortured, I am sure that we have to use any tricks.\u201d\n\n>The use of long-range missiles to hit inside Russia is a particularly sensitive topic for the White House, which has long worried that the Ukraine conflict could escalate out of control and force a catastrophic standoff between the United States and Russia, the world\u2019s largest nuclear powers.\n\n>Though Washington has given Zelensky billions of dollars\u2019 worth of advanced weaponry, President Biden has steadily rebuffed the Ukrainian leader\u2019s request for long-range ATACMS, shorthand for the Army Tactical Missile System, capable of striking targets up to 185 miles away. Since the start of the war, Biden has said the United States is \u201cnot encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders.\u201d\n\n>When asked about the intelligence indicating he had weighed the use of long-range missiles to hit Russia, Zelensky said it is not something Ukraine is entertaining. \u201cNo one in our country has given orders for offensives or strikes on Russian territory,\u201d he said.\n\n>It is unclear whether the United States has shared accounts of Zelensky\u2019s plotting with allied nations, but the Ukrainian president continues to enjoy the strong support of Western governments, which have provided him with an increasingly sophisticated array of weaponry.\n\n>This past week, Britain became the first Western country to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles. The Storm Shadow, a cruise missile system with stealth capabilities, has a range of 155 miles, far exceeding the 50-mile range of the U.S.-provided HIMARS launchers.\n\n>British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said Friday that the missile would give Ukraine \u201cthe best chance\u201d to defend itself and would be for use only \u201cwithin Ukrainian sovereign territory.\u201d A spokesman with the British Embassy in Washington declined to comment on whether Zelensky\u2019s leaked remarks might give London pause about its decision.\n\n>The Biden administration says Zelensky\u2019s intercepted comments are not the cause for withholding ATACMS.\n\n>\u201cUkraine has repeatedly committed to employ U.S.-provided weapons responsibly and strategically when needed to counter Russian aggression, and we are confident that will continue to be the case,\u201d said a U.S. defense official who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.\n\n>Since last year, Zelensky has promised that Ukraine would never use U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia, a pledge the White House says he has fulfilled.\n\n>\u201cPresident Zelensky has kept the promises he has made to President Biden, and we do not believe that that will change,\u201d said a senior administration official.\n\n>One reason for not providing the long-range missiles is the \u201crelatively few ATACMS\u201d the United States has for its own defense needs, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Defense One in March.\n\n>Zelensky, however, said he believes the United States isn\u2019t sending the weapons because it doesn\u2019t trust Kyiv.\n\n>\u201cI think they are afraid that we might use them on the territory of Russia,\u201d Zelensky told The Post. \u201cBut I would always tell our partners \u2026 \u2018We have a priority target for which we are spending the ammunition packages we receive, and we spend it on the deoccupation of purely Ukrainian territories,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n>While there is no indication that Ukraine has used Western missiles to strike into Russian territory, the same cannot be said for Kyiv\u2019s use of armed drones.\n\n>Explosions caused by unmanned aerial vehicles have become a regular occurrence in Russia, including in Rostov, where a drone crashed into an oil refinery this month. Ukrainian officials are often coy about the incidents, hinting that they\u2019re responsible without directly taking credit.\n\n>Two drone attacks in December on Russia\u2019s Engels air base in Saratov, more than 370 miles from the Ukrainian border, showed \u201cthat we have the ability to reach many kilometers farther than they could expect,\u201d Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, said in an interview earlier this year.\nRussia this month accused Ukraine of staging a drone attack intended to kill President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. Videos circulating on social media and verified by The Post show two drones streaking toward the Kremlin at about 2:30 a.m. local time. The allegation was forcefully denied by Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky.\n\n>One document describes a plan developed by Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency last year to **conduct covert attacks on Russian forces in Syria using secret Kurdish help.** The detailed plot would have opened a new battlefield thousands of miles from Ukraine, but in December, **Zelensky directed his aides to \u201ccease planning for operations against Russian forces in Syria,\u201d the document says, without explaining why the plan was aborted.**\n\n>Zelensky, in the recent interview, said he reserved the right to explore a range of military options.\n\n>\u201cI have a lot of generals with whom I work,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cAnd these are my personal conversations.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe war is about the occupation of Ukraine,\u201d he added. \u201cUkraine must win.\u201d",

The UN definition states that genocide is an attempt to physically annihilate a people. It then lists four possible acts that are part of genocide, *if they are part of a plan to physically annihilate the group in question*.\n\nHowever, recently, a misreading has been circulating online that claims that any of those four acts are themselves genocide, even if they're not part of a plan to physically annihilate a people.
