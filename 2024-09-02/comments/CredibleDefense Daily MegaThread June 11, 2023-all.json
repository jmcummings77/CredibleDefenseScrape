They're already demonstrated it making it deep into occupied territory, so between their low observability and NATO intel helping plan a less dangerous route for the missile, they could probably make most of the trek undetected. Then you have the range question; I don't know if Ukraine can launch them very close to the front since they have to be air-launched from Su-24s, and based on current frontlines I believe they would have to be launched very close to the front to make it all the way to the bridge with the 300km limitation on the export version (however I don't believe it was ever explicitly confirmed that they received the export versions, perhaps Ukraine did get longer range ones). And if air-launched close to the front, but at very low altitude to avoid detection of the Su-24, would they even have 300km range anymore? Finally, I suspect Russia may have set up more layers of AA around the bridge, such as SPAAGs specifically to stop Storm Shadow in its final approach (it is a slow-moving cruise missile after all -- even if undetectable by radar, gun-based AA ought to have a shot, no?). \n\nAlso: does Storm Shadow have the targeting capability to strike the bridge directly? I believe it uses some sort of imaging-based targeting for its terminal phase, doesn't it?",

On which of these points have we reached results today? Not one.\"\n\nZatulin's spokesperson did not respond to requests for further comment.\n\n\"The mood is very gloomy among the elite,\" said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R-Politik, a political analysis firm. \"They don't understand what Putin's plans are and doubt whether he is adequately dealing with the situation. This has been going on for a long time, but the worry is building up.\"\n\nThe well-connected member of Russian diplomatic circles who remains in contact with government officials said the mood turned gloomier last week after Western proposals emerged for long-term security agreements for Ukraine. That would provide Kyiv with guaranteed arms supplies over a multiyear period as an alternative to immediate NATO membership.\n\n\"This determines the main worry of the Russian leadership,\" this person said. \"If contemporary weapons will be supplied and the Ukrainian army will be modernized, then \u2014 even without formal membership \u2014 Ukraine in this form can represent an existential threat for Russia.\"\n\n\"It seems to me this is further stimulus for Russia to continue the military operation,\" he added.\n\nPutin had appeared to count on diminishing Western resolve to support Ukraine, especially with a presidential election in 2024 in the United States, where a minority of Republicans have argued against continuing high levels of assistance to Ukraine. **In Moscow, that assumption is eroding, insiders say.**\n\n\"Modest signals\" have emerged that Russia could be willing to make some compromises, the well-connected member of Russian diplomatic circles said. Margarita Simonyan, the usually hawkish head of RT, the Russian state propaganda TV channel, this month called for the conflict to be frozen at the current front lines with referendums to be held in the seized territories on whether the residents there want to be part of Russia or Ukraine. Otherwise, she warned, Ukraine was certain to use the long-range weapons it was receiving from Western allies to hit Russian territory.\n\n\"This is already a certain revision of the official Russian position,\" the member of Russian diplomatic circles said.\n\nBut others cautioned that Simonyan's words represented no more than a fresh propaganda ploy by the Kremlin because any attempt to freeze the conflict at the current lines was only aimed at acquiring more time for the Russian army to rearm to attack again.\n\n\"Everyone in the Kremlin understands the danger of the Ukrainian counteroffensive,\" Stanovaya said. \"Freezing the situation is very convenient, as this is exactly what will give Putin the time he needs for Ukraine and the West to lose their military zeal and unity.\"\n\nEven as Russian border regions such as Belgorod have come under intensified shelling and drone attacks in recent days, the Kremlin has sought to downplay the impact of the incursions and has kept to a minimum any coverage of the attacks on state television. Still, resentment is bubbling up.\n\n\"How long will this go on!!! First, the border areas \u2026 now the outskirts of Belgorod,\" said one area resident in online comments. \"We supported the Special Military Operation because we believed that it would push this evil spirits away from our borders, but the complete opposite has happened.\"\n\nAnother resident asked, \"What does Putin think? What does he decide?\"\n\nThe drone attacks in Moscow targeting plush residential compounds housing members of the Russian elite are starting to \"impact people very seriously psychologically,\" one Russian businessman said, especially because in the capital, the war had until recently often seemed like no more than background noise. The spate of attacks could strengthen the position of hawks calling for martial law and the closure of Russia's borders, and increase squabbling among those seeking to secure their positions and wealth, he said.\n\nPublic tirades by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the boss of the Wagner mercenary group and close Putin ally, against Russian army leadership for the failings of the war serve to \"let off steam\" and take place with Putin's permission because the criticism is channeled through someone who presents himself as a patriot, Stanovaya said.\n\nBut \"at some moment,\" said Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected political consultant, infighting among factions in the elite around Putin \"could spiral out of control.\u201d\n\n\"If Russia loses the corridor to Crimea, it will be a very serious blow,\" she said. \"Everyone understands how important it is for Putin, and it will mean Putin has again not calculated the situation correctly and again not managed the situation. It will mean a very serious failure.\"",

Russians assert that if Ukraine develops an army robust enough to resist willy-nilly invasions by Russia, this fact then presents an existential risk to Russia. Say what?

Once Ukraine actually has a modernised army, it's really only the Ukrainian command which gets to decide what to do with them. And they've already shown willingness to strike Russian territory when it makes tactical sense, regardless of any written stipulations from arms suppliers. \n\nUkraine does not need to stage a ground invasion of Russia to scare the Kremlin shitless. If unable to directly retake some territory (e.g. the Crimean peninsula is famously hard to take from a prepared defender) then it's extremely plausible that Ukraine could pressure the Russians into abandoning it at the negotiating table by striking the Russian heartlands. They're years away from doing so effectively, but the Russians do not want to sit around and let them get there.\n\nIf nukes were all that were needed to guarantee a country's security, then why do all the world's nuclear powers maintain large conventional armies?",

From the article, \"the firm belief among most of the Moscow elite that Russia cannot lose because it has nuclear weapons...\" To me that means Russian elites feel they can't lose because they have access to the ultimate trump card, but that also means they'd have to use the ultimate trump card.

Most of obstacles are covered firstly by massive volumes of indirect fire.

There is little doubt the new military drive will influence discussions of future support for Ukraine as well as debates about how to guarantee its future. What remains unclear, though, is exactly what the United States, Europe and Ukraine view as a \u201csuccessful\u201d counteroffensive.\n\nPublicly, American and European officials are leaving any definition of success to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. For now, Mr. Zelensky has not laid out any public goals, beyond his oft-stated demand that Russian troops must leave the whole of Ukraine. He is known as a master communicator; any perception that he is backing off that broad ambition would risk undermining his support at a critical moment.\n\nPrivately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia\u2019s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Still, two themes emerge as clear ideas of \u201csuccess\u201d: that the Ukrainian army retake and hold on to key swaths of territory previously occupied by the Russians, and that Kyiv deal the Russian military a debilitating blow that forces the Kremlin to question the future of its military options in Ukraine.\n\nSuccess is not guaranteed. Throughout the war, the Ukrainian army, with deeply motivated troops, creative military operations and advanced Western weaponry, has outperformed Russia\u2019s  military. But the Ukrainians have also found it difficult to dislodge the Russians from their entrenched defensive positions in the last few months, with the front lines barely moving.\n\nNevertheless, Ukraine has shown it can launch successful offensives, like the one last year in which it took a large amount of territory east of Kharkiv and, after a long fight, regained the southern city of Kherson.\n\nSeizing the nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia would be both a symbolic and strategic victory, putting one of the world\u2019s largest nuclear plants and an important source of electricity back in the hands of Ukraine.\n\nAmerican and European officials say it is key for Ukraine to cut off, or at least squeeze, the so-called land bridge: the large swath of territory Russia seized between its border and the peninsula of Crimea, which has become a main supply route for the military stronghold it has built there.\n\nKyiv wants to reclaim its southeastern coast on the Sea of Azov. If Ukraine can drive its forces to the coastline, cutting off Crimea, Mr. Zelensky could count that as a huge win. But even if Ukrainian forces did not reach the sea, and instead took midsize cities in southern Ukraine, that would effectively narrow the land bridge.\r  \n\r  \nFrom those positions, Ukrainian forces could use medium-range artillery to threaten Russian command posts on Crimea and any military supply convoys Russia sends along the coastline. While the Russian forces in Crimea are currently well supplied, American officials said, laying siege to the land bridge would make the winter difficult for them.\r  \n\r  \nRetaking land is one thing, but what is crucial, American officials said, is for Ukrainian forces to hold on to it.\r  \n\r  \n\rA strong showing by Ukraine will have the added benefit of further eroding Russian troops\u2019 morale. Right now, the Russian army faces critical shortages of weapons and personnel \u2014 Moscow was forced to take decades-old tanks out of storage to use in fighting and has relied on barely trained conscripts. Those shortages should prevent Russia\u2019s forces from capitalizing on any Ukrainian missteps or mounting their own offensive in the coming months.\r  \n\r  \n\rStill, Russian forces are beginning to get better \u2014 they are improving their tactics and practicing better defensive operations. War always favors the defenders, something the entrenched Russians may be able to use to their advantage during Ukraine\u2019s counterattack.\r  \n\r  \nFor now, the Russian air force has been largely absent in the war, with Ukrainian air defense batteries threatening Russian bombers and fighter planes. The United States and its allies have tried to shore up the shortages in Ukraine\u2019s air defense equipment. But if Russia flies more aggressive bombing runs into Ukraine, it could pose a challenge during the counteroffensive.\r  \n\r  \nAmerican and European officials say a vital goal of the counteroffensive should be to weaken the Russian military further. Russian forces have taken huge numbers of casualties in fighting this year in Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Success, as one NATO ambassador put it, would be pushing Russia back and killing a lot of Russian troops.\r  \n\r  \nAnother potential scenario, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, is that the Russians make an error, for example by putting their troops in the wrong place or defending a trench line too lightly, which could allow Ukraine to punch through the lines and execute a devastating blow to Russian troops.\r  \n\r  \nOf course, some allied officials worry that Ukraine might be too successful. A huge loss of soldiers could force Mr. Putin to mobilize a broader swath of his population to build up his army.\r  \n\r  \nAnd while U.S. officials have said the risk of Mr. Putin\u2019s using a nuclear weapon have receded, American intelligence agencies say total defeat in Ukraine or a loss of Crimea are two scenarios under which Mr. Putin could potentially order the use of a nuclear weapon.\r  \n\r  \nA failed counteroffensive is easier to measure. If battle lines stay relatively unchanged, or Ukraine is unable to recapture a significant city, some officials in allied capitals or Congress will likely raise doubts about the war, especially if Ukrainians lose too many troops and a lot of equipment is destroyed.\r  \n\r  \n\rDespite some early casualties, and tough Russian defenses in the east, American officials are optimistic that Ukraine will make enough gains, however incremental, to call the fighting a success.\r  \n\r  \nBoth Ukraine and Western allies have invested in the counteroffensive because, no matter the precise result, it will set the stage for the next phase of the war. The American and British plan to help secure Ukraine involves building support for robust security guarantees from the United States and NATO countries as well as pushing a plan to build closer economic ties between Kyiv and European countries.\r  \n\r  \nCrucially, if the counteroffensive leaves Russia weakened, it could be forced to engage in meaningful dialogue with a stronger Ukraine.\r  \n\r  \nBiden administration officials are careful to say their support for Ukraine will not hinge on the success of the counteroffensive.\r  \n\r  \nSpeaking with Rishi Sunak, the prime minister of Britain on Thursday, President Biden brushed aside questions of future funding for Ukraine\u2019s fight.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI believe we\u2019ll have the funding necessary to support Ukraine as long as it takes,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\r  \n\r  \nBut realistically, success or failure could have an impact on support inside a fractious U.S. Congress, which has to authorize any additional funding for Ukraine, as well as in Europe, where there are similar concerns about how long the war will last, how much it will cost and what it will do to the prices of energy and food in the longer run.\r  \n\r\n\nWhatever the outcome of the counteroffensive, American and European officials agree that for now, Mr. Putin is in no mood to negotiate. But Mr. Putin understands raw power, and that is what makes the counteroffensive so important.

            "body": "It comes down to strategy to end the war. \n\nManeuver warfare in this context refers to battle of annihilation, either directly destroying the enemy's ability to resist by destroying their military in decisive battles, or conquering enough important territory to force the enemy to capitulate because they have no choice. \n\nExamples of this is France 1940 and France 1944. The former saw the Germans attempting to beat France by destroying the French and British armies through a maneuver centric \"short and lively\" campaign focused on mobility. In 1944, the Allies invaded France when the goal to advance on and take the Ruhr industrial area of western Germany, which would destroy Germany's armament capabilities forcing them to surrender.\n\nAttrition is a strategy where the operational and tactical objectives are focusing on causing the enemy damage that they cannot sustain. That might be military manpower and equipment, or it could also come down to civil willpower and morale (the German military theorist Delbruk broke it down further of attrition and exhaustion). An example of attrition is US policy in the Korean War from early 1951 to the close of the war, where national politics forbade another invasion of North Korea or attacking the Chinese homeland due to fear of escalation, requiring a way to force the combined communist Chinese and North Koreans forces to capitulate due to heavy military losses (the first use of Kill Ratio math dictating military operations) and the total destruction of North Korean society by aerial bombardment.\n\nThe Russian-Ukraine War started off as a battle of annihilation when the Russians tried a maneuver centric campaign to take over the country. They limited their political objectives to take the Donbas but couldn't pull off a mobile campaign either as the Ukrainians put up a \"hold at all cost\" defense that largely stopped them while causing extremely heavy losses. \n\nIt appears the Russians have since adopted an attrition/exhaustion strategy to win, hence the broad front winter offensive that didn't seem capable of much besides forcing the UAF to fight hard throughout the winter, as well as the regular long range PGM attacks on Kyiv and other cities to include the power grid. The biggest problem with attritional strategy is the unknowns, not fully knowing enemy strength and production capacity, or making major assumptions usually underestimating the enemy to make them seem more vulnerable. This is especially true of any focus on willpower, fear, or other intangibles. Its a big gamble, and it's often failed.\n\nUkraine strategy also seems focused on attrition to a heavy degree, their general staff has demonstrated a great interest in talking up Russian losses when discussing the operational scheme of maneuvers of certain campaigns (like Bakhmut), though they also have obviously focused on mobility centric ops like last year's Kharkiv counteroffensive and maybe even this offensive. The US top brass is HEAVILY pressuring them to focus on a maneuver centric offensive, and there is some merit to that. They outnumber the Russians, have the quality edge, and better intelligence and some other enablers. However, the Russians heavily fortified occupied territory, which will make maneuver more difficult as it will require breaking out of positional warfare first, no easy feet considering the depth of Russian defenses in certain sectors is ~30 kilometers thick in 2-3 lines. Russia is struggling with sanctions and economic issues, the war is rather unpopular especially the idea of universal service for it, etc. \n\nAll that said, a combatant doesn't need to only pursue a single strategy. It can help with ensuring operations are coherent but often it's beneficial to not place all the eggs in one basket.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It comes down to strategy to end the war. </p>\n\n<p>Maneuver warfare in this context refers to battle of annihilation, either directly destroying the enemy&#39;s ability to resist by destroying their military in decisive battles, or conquering enough important territory to force the enemy to capitulate because they have no choice. </p>\n\n<p>Examples of this is France 1940 and France 1944. The former saw the Germans attempting to beat France by destroying the French and British armies through a maneuver centric &quot;short and lively&quot; campaign focused on mobility. In 1944, the Allies invaded France when the goal to advance on and take the Ruhr industrial area of western Germany, which would destroy Germany&#39;s armament capabilities forcing them to surrender.</p>\n\n<p>Attrition is a strategy where the operational and tactical objectives are focusing on causing the enemy damage that they cannot sustain. That might be military manpower and equipment, or it could also come down to civil willpower and morale (the German military theorist Delbruk broke it down further of attrition and exhaustion).

It&#39;d eliminate the uniqueness of some of the privileges from bilateral agreements negotiated before and in the wake of the war, eg. addressing economic migration - and countries such as Poland have their own demographic holes to fill in, with the common attitude being regarding young ukrainians as a preferred source. people It&#39;d threaten thwarting any attempts at institutional reform, by adding yet another veto-power-wielding head-of-state to deal with - with his vote bolstered by 5th or 6th member state population (for many of the issues not requiring consensus, a qualified majority of MSs representing at least 65% of EU Population decides) - further diluting the voice of the reformers (Netherlands, Nordics in particular). It&#39;d add in another bunch of MEPs elected by (by the European standards) conservative and nationalistic-minded populace. This will be exacerbated once the war veterans would enter politics at large in the 20s-30s. Finally, the scope of the investment in infrastructure required for convergence with EU climate policies would be tremendous even before the war. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, i think there are many other potential points of contention currently glossed over wrt. Ukrainian accession, but nonetheless real and in my opinion sufficient to prolong the process squarely into the 30s.</p>\n</div>",

The drone's speed is 150 km/h, while a fighter jet flies at a minimum of 400 km/h.\"\r  \n\r  \n>Ihnat added: \"And we can't get those drones during the night using ground forces' air defense equipment or mobile firing groups, either.\"  \n \n>The spokesman further claimed that Russia deliberately deploys the drones at night due to the difficulty they present, particularly in the hope that the tactic will result in Ukrainian forces wasting their anti-aircraft ordinances.

He and his European counterparts should have thought about this when they failed to provide Iran with an economic alternative after the US broke its word by cancelling the nuclear agreement and re-installed sanctions.\n\nIran doesn't take Europe seriously whatsoever.

When lots of them have been launched, they all fly along different routes, staying close to the ground, so that it&#39;s difficult to shoot them from a plane. The drone&#39;s speed is 150 km/h, while a fighter jet flies at a minimum of 400 km/h.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ihnat added: &quot;And we can&#39;t get those drones during the night using ground forces&#39; air defense equipment or mobile firing groups, either.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>The spokesman further claimed that Russia deliberately deploys the drones at night due to the difficulty they present, particularly in the hope that the tactic will result in Ukrainian forces wasting their anti-aircraft ordinances. This would also allow Russian forces to more accurately deduce where Ukraine&#39;s defense systems are located.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/why-russias-iranian-drones-are-real-headache-kyiv-air-force-1805813\">https://www.newsweek.com/why-russias-iranian-drones-are-real-headache-kyiv-air-force-1805813</a></p>\n\n<p>Macron should spare his efforts to pressure Iran from continuing to provide Russia with Shaheds and other equipment behind the scenes. He and his European counterparts should have thought about this when they failed to provide Iran with an economic alternative after the US broke its word by cancelling the nuclear agreement and re-installed sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>Iran doesn&#39;t take Europe seriously whatsoever. It has no strategic autonomy; is dependent on the Americans for its security and has no military clout in the Middle East anymore.</p>\n</div>",

The original plan was to revive the JCPOA, but now it&#39;s apparent that Iran isn&#39;t interested in a peaceful relationship with the West. A sanctions relief would just be used to rearm for the next proxy war, possibly even doubling down on helping Russia in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Plan B - Israel&#39;s preferred solution - isn&#39;t viable either. The US is busy helping Ukraine and Taiwan. Now is not the time for another military operation, as suggested in an article discussed yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>What remains is Plan C, essentially kicking the can down the road. One could perhaps hope that this solution will work until the Middle East loses relevance due to the energy transition. Then Iran becomes someone else&#39;s problem.</p>\n</div>",

Meanwhile, more than the rhetoric of Russian politicians, it is the course of events that has convinced them of this.\n\n...\n\nSociety today is divided almost equally into two opposing camps.

The event led to a jump in Prigozhin\u2019s standing in the eyes of ordinary people\n\n...\n\n*Attacks on Russian territory*\r  \n\r  \nOther events in May could also have convinced people that the conflict was dragging on and needed to be continued: attempts by Ukrainian sabotage groups to penetrate Russian territory, the barrage against Belgorod and Shebekino, the bombing of Zakhar Prilepin\u2019s car, who is much more known than Vladlen Tatarsky, who had died earlier, drone attacks on Moscow and other Russian cities.\r  \n\r  \nIndividually, no such event greatly affects public sentiment. Thus, during one of the last focus groups with young Muscovites, the participants very briefly expressed only general concern about the latest drone attack and quickly moved on to discussing everyday problems.

As one participant said, \u201cif they can get to Putin,\u201d what can we, mere mortals, expect. Older people are generally more attentive to such events and are thus somewhat more likely to project the risks onto themselves. Still, there were no particular emotions this time either: they talked, complained about \u201ca gap in our defense,\u201d remembered how \u201cat one time a Cessna landed on Red Square\u201d \u2013 in other words, this had all happened before \u2013 and moved on to discussing other events.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, taken together, such events gradually blend into a disturbing backdrop, creating a feeling of suspense, uncertainty about the future, and fear. This anxiety remains diffuse, unfocused, often unspoken and not reflected on \u2013 positive moods still prevail. Anxious moods seem typical, first and foremost, for the most well-informed Russians. As they say, the less you know, the better you sleep.\r  \n\r  \nThe companion of this anxiety is gradually increasing bitterness, which spills over into focus groups: \u201cwhy are we pulling our punches with them (Ukrainians, Europeans, Americans);\u201d \u201cwe\u2019re still messing around with them;\u201d \u201cit\u2019s time to bang.\u201d Thus, the lobby for a \u201cdecisive response\u201d to the enemy is finding new supporters.\n\n...\n\nThe further path of public sentiment and the readiness to continue adapting to the realities of a protracted military conflict will directly depend on the ability of the authorities to maintain socio-economic stability and avoid direct involvement of ever larger segments of the population in the conflict for as long as possible.

The insensitivity of public opinion to bad news, as well as the high levels of support for the regime and the military, is due not to our national character, but to the fact that huge resources have been devoted to maintaining public calm.\n\nLevada notes several examples of this: pensions, salaries of state employees and social benefits were indexed, various bonuses and social guarantees were paid by the local authorities to the families of mobilised personnel (in addition to the rather generous pay), and greater resources have been devoted to encouraging volunteering in order to ensure a steady stream of personnel without the social shocks of the previous mobilisation campaign.\n\nThe article goes on to note that:\n\n> The further path of public sentiment and the readiness to continue adapting to the realities of a protracted military conflict will directly depend on the ability of the authorities to maintain socio-economic stability and avoid direct involvement of ever larger segments of the population in the conflict for as long as possible. Otherwise, the hitherto unfocused anxiety and anxiety, latent in many Russians, may crystallize and find a way out at the most inopportune moment for the regime.\n\nMy big takeaway from this is that Russian authorities have so far maintained the current levels of support not through some massive North Korean dystopian scheme, but largely by:\n\n* Confining the social effects of mobilisation to population segments where they can be adequately managed (geography helps a lot here, too), both socially and economically\n* Shielding population segments that can easily organise (state employees) or are economically vulnerable (seniors) and can assemble in high-profile, high-impact demonstrations (Russia has some scars about railway workers' strikes, for example, and it's also likely that special forces firing tear gas at the crowds and dragging people to police stations will have more impact if they're beating grandmas, rather than young workers)\n* Ensuring that those who support the war can channel their efforts towards support it (e.g. by volunteering) while those who don't support it are mostly shielded from the effects of the war\n\nAll of these depend on capabilities that are susceptible to errosion. They require ample economic resources. It's not propaganda alone.\n\nSo on the one hand, it's certainly wrong to think the relative stability the Russian government has endured is solely due to the social and political culture of post-Soviet Russian society. *Some* of it has enabled these measures, for sure -- relative uninvolvement in local and national politics, proneness to posturing and grand statements, vulnerability to conspiracy theory and so on -- but the Russian government has had to actively nurture this stability. That means it's possible to undermine these efforts. Any active efforts are prone to being undermined, either by combating their effects directly or by denying the resources they require.\n\nBut on the other hand, focusing on \"soft\" propaganda alone is not going to cut it. High-profile assassinations or border incursions won't have the desired impact as long as the government can spin them their way. So IMHO things like border incursions aren't a bad idea per se, but they need to be part of an ampler information campaign, or they need to be better targeted, otherwise they're just going to provide entertainment value and propaganda fodder for the likes of Simonyan.\n\nEdit: FWIW, I encourage everyone, always, to read the articles being linked to, not just here but everywhere. Even when the poster has the best intentions, truncating a text can subtly change the relative weight of the points it's making, if not obscure its meaning all the way.

Therefore, we regularly observe how the Russian Armed Forces lose entire units from mortar shelling, how artillery destroys long-term firing points, how soldiers go to their positions or flee from them through bare fields, how they move between trenches not in the course of communication, but by running and in open areas.</p>\n\n<p>This has given now (once again) the ratio of losses of the coming (AFU) and defending (Russian Armed Forces) as 1 to 1.5 and in some places 1 to 2.</p>\n</div>",
