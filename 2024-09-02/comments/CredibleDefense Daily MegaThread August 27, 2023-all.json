      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

            "body": "Disclaimer: I'm not an Air Force pilot, was medically DQd during my flight physical and am a mere inactive ready reserve lieutenant waiting to go active duty as a developmental engineer. That said, I have a decent amount of SME relevant to the subject based on my own research and conversations with various people in the career field. There are no real shortage of people attracted to the idea of flying military jets. The main issue is getting them all commissioned, getting them all into training, and then keeping them in the military once they have experience.\n\nFirst of all, a lot of talk about the military pilot shortage doesn't discriminate about rank or seniority in the career field. For some background on how the AF pilot pipeline works, the USAF has a 10-year service commitment for pilots which starts as soon as they finish their ~1.5 year-long undergraduate pilot training (UPT). After that, pilots on the fighter/bomber track start training in the T-38 and those on the cargo/tanker track study on the T-1, which is ostensibly a small business jet. Pilots who were competitively accepted to the T-38 pipeline during UPT might choose or be forced to go to aircraft available on the T-1 pipeline, but not vice versa. Generally, pilots who went to T-38 school but went to cargo/tankers *might* have some opportunities to track back into fighters/bombers, but T-1 guys AFAIK basically never have the chance to crossflow into fast pointy-nosed planes. For pilots in both categories, as their 10-year commitment comes up they come at a crossroads where they have the option of staying in the military or jumping to airlines. The AF has wiggled some big bonuses (think 500,000 disbursed over an additional 5-10 years) in front of pilots, but even with that the temptation of raking in legacy airline cash often still outweighs the temptation of advancing in pay from O-4 to O-6 as a field grade officer (FGO).\n\nSecond, the previous issue of retaining FGOs was turned completely on its head 3 years ago by the pandemic. FGOs in aviation who were still in (but not in position for so long that they might be forced out) decided to re-up their contracts since every airline froze hiring in 2020. The military has congressionally mandated limits on the number of officers it can bring aboard. Because our beloved brain trust in the senate and house decided not to adjust the numbers, it meant that the air force all of a sudden was retaining a ton of officers and had to cut its future projections on commissions. The 3 main commissioning sources for the AF are the Air Force Academy (USAFA), Air Force ROTC (AFROTC), and Officer Training School (OTS). Each source gives out allocations for officer commissions, i.e. enrollment allocations (EAs) at different stages in the process. An EA is basically a coupon which says \"finish your commissioning program at the time you say you will, and we guarantee you a gold bar\". USAFA does so to their cadets as soon as they're admitted, so USAF can plan out some commissions 4 years in advance before USAFA cadets even enter the academy. AFROTC makes its cadets compete for commissioning spots spring of there sophomore years, 2-3 years in advance of their graduation date.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not an Air Force pilot, was medically DQd during my flight physical and am a mere inactive ready reserve lieutenant waiting to go active duty as a developmental engineer. That said, I have a decent amount of SME relevant to the subject based on my own research and conversations with various people in the career field. There are no real shortage of people attracted to the idea of flying military jets. The main issue is getting them all commissioned, getting them all into training, and then keeping them in the military once they have experience.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, a lot of talk about the military pilot shortage doesn&#39;t discriminate about rank or seniority in the career field. For some background on how the AF pilot pipeline works, the USAF has a 10-year service commitment for pilots which starts as soon as they finish their ~1.5 year-long undergraduate pilot training (UPT). After that, pilots on the fighter/bomber track start training in the T-38 and those on the cargo/tanker track study on the T-1, which is ostensibly a small business jet. Pilots who were competitively accepted to the T-38 pipeline during UPT might choose or be forced to go to aircraft available on the T-1 pipeline, but not vice versa. Generally, pilots who went to T-38 school but went to cargo/tankers <em>might</em> have some opportunities to track back into fighters/bombers, but T-1 guys AFAIK basically never have the chance to crossflow into fast pointy-nosed planes. For pilots in both categories, as their 10-year commitment comes up they come at a crossroads where they have the option of staying in the military or jumping to airlines. The AF has wiggled some big bonuses (think 500,000 disbursed over an additional 5-10 years) in front of pilots, but even with that the temptation of raking in legacy airline cash often still outweighs the temptation of advancing in pay from O-4 to O-6 as a field grade officer (FGO).</p>\n\n<p>Second, the previous issue of retaining FGOs was turned completely on its head 3 years ago by the pandemic. FGOs in aviation who were still in (but not in position for so long that they might be forced out) decided to re-up their contracts since every airline froze hiring in 2020. The military has congressionally mandated limits on the number of officers it can bring aboard. Because our beloved brain trust in the senate and house decided not to adjust the numbers, it meant that the air force all of a sudden was retaining a ton of officers and had to cut its future projections on commissions. The 3 main commissioning sources for the AF are the Air Force Academy (USAFA), Air Force ROTC (AFROTC), and Officer Training School (OTS). Each source gives out allocations for officer commissions, i.e. enrollment allocations (EAs) at different stages in the process. An EA is basically a coupon which says &quot;finish your commissioning program at the time you say you will, and we guarantee you a gold bar&quot;. USAFA does so to their cadets as soon as they&#39;re admitted, so USAF can plan out some commissions 4 years in advance before USAFA cadets even enter the academy. AFROTC makes its cadets compete for commissioning spots spring of there sophomore years, 2-3 years in advance of their graduation date. Lastly, OTS candidates compete a year or less before their class date. Ideally, this means that the USAF can allocate officer commissions on an as-needed basis as the last possible date to send in a new year group of 2nd Louies draws ever closer. This also creates a sliding scale of predictability for numbers of commissions per commissioning source which goes USAFA&gt;AFROTC&gt;OTS. Unfortunately, during COVID this backfired. EAs for USAFA had been rubberstamped long before they were even duolies. During my sophomore year in 2019-2020, my AFROTC detachment had been selected for EAs before the pandemic hit at a typical accessions rate of like 85%.

And those jobs are actually a pretty big deal first for the officer if they want to get up to that Col. rank and a decent pension, and second for the USAF. First as a rule officers dont stay in combat units their entire career. Thats just a fact. They will instead do one or two year rotations in and out of units to build different skills. Typically youll do one in a combat unit, one on a staff, and then back. Part of that is to prevent burnout, part is to learn new skills, part is so the person in the billet can lead some kind of normal-ish life. The other factor here thats super important is Goldwater Nichols which regulates how officers get promoted AND how the services assign officers to staff positions. Joint staffwork has to be the priority for each service, not their own provincial staffs. AND GN requires the services send their best, very often joint staff experience is a prereq for higher command levels. Because its a requirement of the law. Because if the law didn't put careers on the line over this shit, the USN would never send an officer to do joint staff duty.\n\nThe result is thus: Staffs are created at need by the JCS to support combatant commanders and domestic based operations. The JCS sets the manning levels for each joint staff based on the consensus view of each service. Now say a service has a hotshot Maverick type pilot they want to promote to squadron command. That guy has to go through the staff system on a prestigious staff to get their promotions. They may also be in competition not just with other USAF officers, but also other service officers as well. So you send your best to get the position, to fulfill the requirements for further promotion, to get the guy you want eventually into the right position.\n\nBut the result is that you sent good pilots, along with good submariners, good armor officers, etc. into desk jobs for a year or two before you get them back for use in a combat unit. Its something people will complain about (oh well soldiers should just FIGHT they shouldnt be TIED to a DESK). But the problem is a lot more complicated than that. And if the USAF is trading combat postings today in exchange for staff work, it *could* mean an officer shortage in the future. Or, in reality, they'll get exemptions to shuffle guys around and the USAF will instead lose a little bit of its pull in the bureaucratic DoD for a few years. Such is the way.",

It\u2019ll take a while, bear with me.\n\nNow there's a lot of fixation on the Surovikin line and OSINT satellite imagery, with a lot of people here **not really acknowledging more inherent issues** with the method itself, and **furthermore extrapolating** Russian \"local level of defence at any given point\" from these relatively limited data sets. This is simply not the reality on the ground.\n\nNow, in this particular example there is a certain dose of incongruity between situation on the ground and what we might infer if we only use satellite imagery. I am referring to tweets (3 and 4) from the chain. Note how just much author allows these particular fortifications to shape his list of proposals for the rest of the thread. Yes, this is speculative, it's not meant to inform the decisions of UA command or something similar, but it's still something I see people do here a lot, on a lot larger scale where I believe the error becomes **compounded**. He then goes on to list a number of issues with advancing using the main route from Robotyne to Tokmak, using **the level of observed fortifications** and ongoing constructions efforts **to infer a certain level of Russian preparedness** in this general direction. He then goes on to offer a different example to the contrary - Verbove, noting all the apparent advantages for UAF if they choose to pursue this avenue of attack (a noted difference in the observed level of fortifications, lack of ongoing construction efforts on the axis, etc.) and then goes onto **again inferring** a certain level of Russian preparedness in this general direction. Now to deal with this particular example, then maybe offer a few things to consider in the future.\n\nFirst, the fortifications in tweet 3 and 4 have been abandoned by the Russians almost immediately after the fall of Robotyne or even ever so slightly before they completely ceded the settlement. This is important for a couple of reasons - first, what we observe as \"current\" lines require a significant amount of work to secure, by the time they are secured the vast majority of **defensive enablers** that Russian relies on have either been suppressed or pushed significantly further behind, ie. ATGM operators, drone operators, artillery coverage, counter battery systems, CW/Jamming assets, AD systems and in this particular sector we've even quite a bit of aviation. In such a **slow-moving scenario** as we are dealing with here, it's simply a given that before an area is secured all these enablers have long been pushed relatively (bearing in mind the general pace of this offensive) far behind or are unable to perform their tasks to a satisfying degree. Remember, lines on the map and people manning them **do not matter as much** as those more trained enablers do, without them there is simply no way to put up an organised defence within the observed positions. Now, by the virtue of getting hung up on this particular fortification, he discarded almost immediately Ukrainian perspectives moving South and/or West. These particular fortifications in Tweets 3 and 4 have not only since been abandoned, but **were a key fortification** in controlling the entry point into the ridge-line extending to Kopani. I am not claiming Ukraine will pursue those, but both of these are **a lot more open** than a cursory look at the map would suggest.\n\nSecond, let's deal with the suggested Verbove advance (Tweets 10 and 11). I will make a few assumptions here that I think have some basis in reality. For example, after everything we've observed we can safely conclude Ukraine is reluctant to enter another \"mine field belt.\" There is obviously a relatively deep minefield belt all along the frontline, but it seems that in this general area, from what we've seen, there is a particularly dense minefield belt. We cannot know how \"deep\" those belts are, but I think we can relatively safely assume they are likely at least 1-2 kilometres deep, at least the UAF is working with some similar assumption. UAF likely lacks enough trained sappers, engineering equipment, the only type of demining they do in the \"secured\" areas is likely just a bare minimum to open up more logistical routes, they simply need to prioritize the most pressing issues as well as maintain the ability to demine areas they intend to advance through - so **protecting these assets is key for UAF**. This is likely why we are seeing them being reluctant to \"open up\" new axes of advance from the pre-offensive lines. Now, let's take an example of the high ground between Robotyne-Verbove road and Polohy Highway, so just North of where UAF is currently in the Verbove direction. If we take a note of **only the observed fortifications on that single \"Hill\"** (I am using DeepState overlay for this example, but for what's it worth ISW has a roughly similar map for this area) we can see they are positioned roughly 1 mile south off the Highway, the Highway itself roughly marking where the pre-offensive line lied. We have seen UAF struggling to take it from North and now even from the West, it's likely there is a significant mine belt that's currently still plaguing their local efforts. Now, if it was **just a matter** of two observed trenches and a minefield belt, the Hill would've been secured a long time ago, but it's not - **it comes down to** all the **unobserved positions** that are either hidden in tree lines, concealed in some other manner or are simply too small to even be properly observed from commercial satellite imagery and in addition to that - all of the assorted **enablers** I've already mentioned. I'll also make one additional assumption - Russians do know what they are doing. It's very likely that, except for the hillside that I've mentioned, the rest of the low grounds have been purposely left demined and with an apparent lack prepared positions. There is **possibly** a lot of well-prepared unobserved positions further East that still haven't been discovered by UAF and it's quite possible Russians simply feel, given that their defence hinges on the enablers which, locally, possibly haven't been as worn-out (it's a relatively new avenue of advance for UAF) as they have been in the Robotyne direction, their local level of unobserved/untested positions are currently sufficient to offer a proper resistance - and if they are not and they do give way, they are diluting UAF efforts from the main axis and are especially tying up sappers and engineering equipment and other key offensive enablers. Remember, in such an environment, given all their previous experiences, they simply need to take their time with making sure they don't get stuck in a minefield and to furthermore push back and/or significantly suppress all the defensive enablers so that they don't get another mass-casualty event publicized all over the news. So, **using this type of data to infer local abilities** of RuAF to put up a defence **is a rather massive leap**. What he immediately pointed out as a possible sign of weakness, **might actually** be quite a strong sign of the opposite.\n\nNow to return to a more \u201cgeneral\u201d perspective in order to sum up my caveats \u2013 again just to acknowledge them. \n\nFirstly, **the imperfection of the method itself** \u2013 the fact is **the vast majority of positions** that UAF and RuAF have fought over (and this is especially the case in Velyka Novosilka direction) **have not been observed** by this method. This does not mean they do not exist or have been built up ad-hoc since then, it simply means we lack a huge chunk of the data. Ask any soldier what\u2019s the most important thing tactically \u2013 concealment, both offensively and defensively. Russians last summer spent a lot of resources \u201cdefoliating by fire.\u201d Both sides consider this to be a precious commodity. There is likely some amount of well dug-in and concealed small supply depots, which might explain why RuAF is able to keep defending certain positions long after their GLOCs have been severely compromised (see: Rivnopil, Pryutne, Novodonetske).",

            "body": "Leopard 1 timelines\n\n\nJust going to give an overview as it's a bit easier.\n\n\n**NUMBERS**\n\n\nIn February, Germany approved the export of up to 178 Leopard 1s. Rheinmetall was said to be approved for 88 and FFG 99 ([source](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/leopard-1-to-arrive-in-ukraine-already-at-the-beginning-of-june)). Half of those will be the Danish version (1A5DK). However, there also was a picture of an 1A5 being repaired at [KMW](https://twitter.com/nicholadrummond/status/1627089956777893888?t=CFxmIlzqCAEQ5GNcrs5dyA&s=19) so it's not just those two companies repairing them. Also, the state of the tanks determined how many could be refurbished, with the number 135 being thrown out.\u00a0\n\n\nA few weeks ago, [another 50 1A5BE were purchased from the Belgian company OIP by Rheinmetall](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/08/dozens-of-secondhand-leopard-1-tanks-bought-by-eu-country-for-use-in-ukraine), though some [report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/08/08/belgium-just-found-another-30-old-leopard-1-tanks-for-ukraine/?sh=1030cb3a521) that they'll only get 30 due to cannibalization of parts.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are also 95-100 formerly Italian 1A5s in the stocks of the Swiss company RUAG that infamously blocked from being sold to Rheinmetall. Yesterday, media reported how they were [sitting outside in the open](https://news.yahoo.com/media-nearly-100-leopard-1-025748123.html) in a bit of an obvious ploy to pressure the Swiss government. Today it was reported that German company Ghmb [bought 25 of them in 2019](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/affaere-zieht-weitere-kreise-deutsche-firma-erhebt-anspruch-auf-25-ruag-panzer) but never picked them up, and now want them. Which is why the Swiss government announced it was investigating RUAG last week.\u00a0\n\n\nAs of right now, only 10 have been reported delivered by the German government. Supposedly 100 are to be delivered this year, with the remaining number (between 35-65) delivered over next year.\u00a0\n\n\n**MODERNIZATION**\n\n\nI've not seen any modernization of the vehicles passed anything that was already carried out; so no extra armor. The variants that are known to be sent are the 1A5DK and 1A5BE. Here's a Twitter thread that talks about the [differences](https://twitter.com/KampfmitKette/status/1689589698270769153) in the variants (check the pictures).\u00a0\n\n\n**TRAINING**\n\n\nPolitico had an [article showcasing their training](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-military-course-germany-ukraine-russia-war-soldiers-training/).

Rheinmetall was said to be approved for 88 and FFG 99 ([source](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/leopard-1-to-arrive-in-ukraine-already-at-the-beginning-of-june)). Half of those will be the Danish version (1A5DK). However, there also was a picture of an 1A5 being repaired at [KMW](https://twitter.com/nicholadrummond/status/1627089956777893888?t=CFxmIlzqCAEQ5GNcrs5dyA&s=19) so it's not just those two companies repairing them. Also, the state of the tanks determined how many could be refurbished, with the number 135 being thrown out. \n\nA few weeks ago, [another 50 1A5BE were purchased from the Belgian company OIP by Rheinmetall](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/08/dozens-of-secondhand-leopard-1-tanks-bought-by-eu-country-for-use-in-ukraine), though some [report](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/08/08/belgium-just-found-another-30-old-leopard-1-tanks-for-ukraine/?sh=1030cb3a521) that they'll only get 30 due to cannibalization of parts. \n\nThere are also 95-100 formerly Italian 1A5s in the stocks of the Swiss company RUAG that were infamously blocked from being sold to Rheinmetall. Yesterday, media reported how they were [sitting outside in the open](https://news.yahoo.com/media-nearly-100-leopard-1-025748123.html) in a bit of an obvious ploy to pressure the Swiss government. Today it was reported that German company Ghmb [bought 25 of them in 2019](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/affaere-zieht-weitere-kreise-deutsche-firma-erhebt-anspruch-auf-25-ruag-panzer) but never picked them up, and now want them. Which is why the Swiss government announced it was investigating RUAG last week. \n\nAs of right now, only 10 have been reported delivered by the German government. Supposedly 100 are to be delivered this year, with the remaining number (between 35-65) delivered over next year. \n\n**MODERNIZATION**\n\nI've not seen any modernization of the vehicles passed anything that was already carried out; so no extra armor. The variants that are known to be sent are the 1A5DK and 1A5BE. Here's a Twitter thread that talks about the [differences](https://twitter.com/KampfmitKette/status/1689589698270769153) in the variants (check the pictures). \n\n**TRAINING**\n\nPolitico had an [article showcasing their training](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-military-course-germany-ukraine-russia-war-soldiers-training/).

The summer has been frustrating and, in some ways, disappointing for Ukraine and its Western backers. But rather than look for a quick diplomatic exit ramp, most senior U.S. officials appear more convinced than ever of the need to stand fast with Kyiv. The United States, in their view, cannot be seen to abandon its ally.\n\nWell that's good?\n\n> American commanders have long believed that the Ukrainians waste artillery fire in crushing barrages that emulate Soviet tactics. By one U.S. estimate, the Ukrainians have fired 2 million rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition since the war began, nearly exhausting Western stockpiles. \n\nLook, I know the West doesn't prioritize artillery as a weapon, but *surely* our artillery stockpiles were not so low that extracting 2 millions rounds \"nearly exhausts\" our stockpiles?\n\n>Pentagon officials have also urged Ukraine to rely less on drones for battlefield awareness and more on ground reconnaissance forces, which can assess Russian positions better. \n\n....What?  \n\n> And they have pressed Kyiv to give junior officers more latitude to exploit opportunities along the sprawling front. On all these points, U.S. officials believe the Ukrainians are responding positively. But the discussion has been prickly in recent weeks.\n\nThere has been a lot of criticism that the western training focused on entirely the wrong things (e.g. map + compass navigation over GPS) and was getting people killed.  With advice like \"use less drones and more ground reconnaissance\", I'm not surprised that they might be a bit prickly.  \n\n\n[Tatarigami_UA responds](https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1695867428247396359)\n\n>3/ Should we accept this statement at face value, it is arguably one of the worst statements I have encountered recently. The statement raises doubts regarding the authenticity of the statement itself. Drones play a pivotal role in minimizing the risk to servicememebers lives\n\n>4/ The majority of frontlines are heavily mined and under constant surveillance by drones, maximizing the risk of reconnaissance missions. Opting to jeopardize human lives over the loss of a drone not only lacks compassion but is also imprudent and devoid of logical rationale.\n\n>5/ Whether it's just an inaccurate reporting or an unreliable source, I hope that this statement is a misrepresentation of someone's remarks, rather than an actual viewpoint originating from within the Pentagon. This argument just doesn't hold water\n\nAnd [Michael Kofman](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1695874366922187168)\n\n> When I see this kind of advice being given by officials it reinforces that we have issues understanding the operating environment, and we\u2019re going to have to have many more conversations on lessons learned from this war.\n\nAndrew Perpetua throwing shade\n\n>Contrary to the opinions of Washington Post writers, Constantine and Liberty Ukraine delivers drones to those who need them. Drones with thermal cameras that can easily spot people walking around from a great distance.",

But rather than look for a quick diplomatic exit ramp, most senior U.S. officials appear more convinced than ever of the need to stand fast with Kyiv. The United States, in their view, cannot be seen to abandon its ally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well that&#39;s good?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>American commanders have long believed that the Ukrainians waste artillery fire in crushing barrages that emulate Soviet tactics. By one U.S. estimate, the Ukrainians have fired 2 million rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition since the war began, nearly exhausting Western stockpiles. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Look, I know the West doesn&#39;t prioritize artillery as a weapon, but <em>surely</em> our artillery stockpiles were not so low that extracting 2 millions rounds &quot;nearly exhausts&quot; our stockpiles?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pentagon officials have also urged Ukraine to rely less on drones for battlefield awareness and more on ground reconnaissance forces, which can assess Russian positions better. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>....What?  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And they have pressed Kyiv to give junior officers more latitude to exploit opportunities along the sprawling front. On all these points, U.S. officials believe the Ukrainians are responding positively. But the discussion has been prickly in recent weeks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There has been a lot of criticism that the western training focused on entirely the wrong things (e.g. map + compass navigation over GPS) and was getting people killed.  With advice like &quot;use less drones and more ground reconnaissance&quot;, I&#39;m not surprised that they might be a bit prickly.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1695867428247396359\">Tatarigami_UA responds</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>3/ Should we accept this statement at face value, it is arguably one of the worst statements I have encountered recently. The statement raises doubts regarding the authenticity of the statement itself. Drones play a pivotal role in minimizing the risk to servicememebers lives</p>\n\n<p>4/ The majority of frontlines are heavily mined and under constant surveillance by drones, maximizing the risk of reconnaissance missions. Opting to jeopardize human lives over the loss of a drone not only lacks compassion but is also imprudent and devoid of logical rationale.</p>\n\n<p>5/ Whether it&#39;s just an inaccurate reporting or an unreliable source, I hope that this statement is a misrepresentation of someone&#39;s remarks, rather than an actual viewpoint originating from within the Pentagon. This argument just doesn&#39;t hold water</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1695874366922187168\">Michael Kofman</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I see this kind of advice being given by officials it reinforces that we have issues understanding the operating environment, and we\u2019re going to have to have many more conversations on lessons learned from this war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Andrew Perpetua throwing shade</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Contrary to the opinions of Washington Post writers, Constantine and Liberty Ukraine delivers drones to those who need them. Drones with thermal cameras that can easily spot people walking around from a great distance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Why is that important? We were THE dominant global artillery army in WW2 and  into the Cold War.\n\nWhy don't we add more artillery now? Because we can't logistically support it. It's not because air support is guaranteed, it never was. We don't have more arty for the same reason we don't double the number of LMGs in an infantry squad: we can't resupply it.\n\nEven into the 1980s, tactical nukes down to 155mm were part of war planning, and that wasn't because air support. Even now, when training and planning for large scale conventional combat ops, air support isn't viewed as mandatory and often isn't even included in training. That's why we have the best artillery in the world, why WE created Excalibur and PGK, why WE created M270 MLRS with DPICM and then GMLRS, why WE created ATACMS, etc. And why WE have the most capable logical system in the world, which we know will still barely perform under high intensity combat. \n\nWhy does Russia and Ukraine have so much tube and rocket artillery? Because both are successor militaries to the Soviet Armed Forces, a military force who loves the idea of destructive fires (literally destroying what they're shooting at) versus suppression and neutralizing, which is what most Western militaries try for, as it's cheaper and more effective for maneuver warfare.\n\nThe Soviet Ground Forces didn't even have remotely the amount of organic artillery inside the division or brigade level as they do now, they instead had LOTS of higher level separate artillery brigades and even divisions. \n\nAfter the Russians made their reforms in the late 2000s, they got rid of most of their separate artillery brigades, minus one per CAA, so used extra tubes and rockets to beef up brigade level fires capabilities as part of their ridiculously shitty BTG doctrine, which was supposed to be able to overwhelm a larger NATO force in a fragmented battlefield with long range fires before the close fight started.\n\nThe Ukrainians also had a crap ton of artillery pieces leftover after the Dissolution. 3x artillery divisions, and 8 artillery brigades. But they got rid of all maneuver command levels above the brigade level, kept some of the separate artillery brigades, scrapped the artillery divisions, then pulled a crap ton out of storage after the Donbas War started and after getting walloped by the Russians, whose fires heavy doctrine helped win quite a few battles where the rather inept UAF came in a distant second (mostly because they entered that war grossly, criminally unprepared to fight it). \n\nPlus, and let's be real, this war is showing what happens to militaries with too many artillery pieces with a destruction focus, they run out of ammo before achieving offensive success, especially when they neglect logistics.

It&#39;s pretty clear that Ukraine but also NATO/West/US have severely underestimated how mined and fortified those defensive lines are and how much effort it would take to breach them, so now as is tradition finger-pointing begins. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, Ukraine also has a fair share of blame in setting expectations extremely high and also painting Russians as total morons doesn&#39;t help when they&#39;re in fact fighting a fairly competent defensive.</p>\n</div>",

So it's definitely something to worry about, but worrying about it is pretty basic military tactics, so I'm sure the Ukrainians are prepared for it.\n\nInterestingly, this could very well be a situation where Russia's extremely heavy use of mines could be limiting their own options.
