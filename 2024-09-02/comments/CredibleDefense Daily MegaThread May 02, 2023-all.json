Not one of the 20 self-propelled howitzers Italy provided to Ukraine earlier this year was battle ready, one adviser to Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry told us. Kyiv has still not persuaded the US to provide long-range precision guided missiles or F-16 fighter jets and there are longstanding concerns about whether it will have sufficient artillery ammunition and barrels.  \n>  \n>Ukraine is assembling eight new assault brigades combining experienced troops and volunteers, know as the \u201coffensive guard(opens a new window)\u201d, and several other brigades of new recruits for its attack. Nine of the new brigades, which typically have 2,000-5,000 troops, are being trained and equipped by western armies. But we know little about their real capabilities.  \n>  \n>What is Ukraine\u2019s objective? Many analysts, Ukrainian and western, assume it is a thrust southwards through Zaporizhzhia province all the way to the Sea of Azov, cutting Russia\u2019s occupying forces in two and severing the land bridge between Russian territory and occupied Crimea. That would be a crushing blow for President Vladimir Putin and a huge undertaking for Kyiv.  \n>  \n>But Ukraine\u2019s forces would have to overcome entrenched Russian forces in layered fortified defences (see this Reuters graphical piece(opens a new window)) and then avoid being outflanked and encircled as they push south.  \n>  \n>The counter-offensive is unlikely to have such a single focus, especially in its early stages.

There will also be feints and deceptions to keep the Russians guessing \u2014 like the excited reports this week of a Ukrainian \u201cbeachhead\u201d on the left bank of the Dnipro river. \u201cBecause we cannot be sure what the offensive will look like we might not know when it has started,\u201d Freedman says.  \n>  \n>If it is going to be hard to call the start of the counter-offensive, it will be even harder to judge its success.

The political fallout would overshadow any possible military gain.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not to say Ukraine can&#39;t attack certain legitimate military targets in Russia like airfields in certain ways (like sabotage or drone attacks). But Ukrainian brigades rolling over the (internationally recognized) Russian border would not end well.</p>\n</div>",

Putin isn&#39;t in power at their whim or their sufferance, they&#39;re actually at his mercy as far as their status and wealth goes.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Hi everyone, I would like to raise a question that I don't know if it has ever been addressed and I think this is the best sub for it.\n\nWe know about the [list](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fu5nC2tX0AAzknr?format=jpg&name=large) of armaments allegedly received by Wagner PMC for April and May.\n\nIn the past few days I was reading from a translated Russian forum (Top War) a complaint about the fact that during past summer/autumn Russia lost huge amounts of ammunition after the arrival of GMLRS missiles and today a certain quantity of the artillery shells provided to front-line units would instead be made up by HEAT ones, such as the 152 mm BP-540 (which weighs much less than a 152 mm HE, for obvious reasons too), suitable for direct fire against armoured targets. The Russians call \"cumulative\" this type of shells.\n\nYesterday, coincidentally, the pro-Russian Twitter user \"Zoka\" posted a [video](https://twitter.com/200_zoka/status/1653092456924078092) testifying to the use of HEAT projectiles from a 2S1 Gvozdika, calling such an event \"rare\". We don't even know if they were actually firing HEAT shells, as Russian SPHs generally do carry 4/5 of such shells inside them, together with 35/45 HE-Frag shells, and the howitzer is in an indirect fire mode in the video. But at this point, we could ask ourselves how rare the use of HEAT shells actually is or whether it is rather beginning to be a widespread trend, lately.\n\nIs the use of this type of ammunition getting bigger, as far as you guys know? It would mean that the Russians have a relevant shortage of  152/122 mm OF-family HE-Frag shells. Good news for the Ukrainians if that's the case, as this type of ammo is much less dangerous for infantry. But I wonder - for an effective use they have to be within a few kilometres from the target, which would even expose them to ATGM fire.",

Transcribing the body of European law into national law is the most arduous and time-consuming task, and often times is deliberately delayed either by the Commission or the national government (often for political reasons).

        "body": "People (here and elsewhere) are debating where and how the Ukrainian summer offensive will come and what are the objectives. The predictions ranging from \u201ejust take Tokmak to get the land bridge within HIMARS range\u201c to \u201edecisive battle that will win the war for Ukraine\u201c. So I felt like speculating myself as well.\n\n\r  \nIn short: \r\n\n* I think the offensive will start with a \u201ebang\u201c and try to achieve major mobile breakthroughs.\n* I think UAF has decisive objectives in mind, but would pursue them only if the situation develops very favorably and the prime objective is achieved.\n* Prime objective is to break the land bridge, reach the sea of Azov and secure flanks.\n* Ultimate decisive objective is the successful invasion of Crimea (I know, bear with me).\n* Minor objective is to make Russian usage of the land bridge too expensive and hopefully impossible.\n\n\r  \nIn a longer form:\r  \n\n\n**Framework of the war, \u201cwargoals\u201d and objectives to win the war.**\r  \n\n\nIt is my amateur opinion, that this war has 4 main ways it can progress and end.\r\n\n* a)\tDecisive Russian victory - Ukraine utterly fails the summer offensive, becomes exhausted from personnel, equipment and materiel losses, in conjuncture with the total collapse of Ukrainian economy and society. Russia finds some new strength: additional mobilizations, air force starts properly working after the exhaustion and destruction of Ukrainian air defense, direct military aid from China. Russia starts pushing Ukraine back and Ukraine agrees to cede South-Eastern Ukraine directly to Russia and cede ultimate sovereignty to Russia, meaning no Western integration, Russia veto in Ukrainian politics, Russian military bases in Ukraine. Likelihood extremely low (1%). I won\u2019t expand on this any further.\r\n* b)\tMajor Russian victory \u2013 Ukraine fails to make more than minor operational advances in their offensive and exhausts future offensive combat power. Russia likewise is incapable of restoring offensive capability and the war settles to a reduced intensity stalemate-state. Results in a short-term de facto annexation of occupied territories to Russia and either eventually develops into a forever stalemate, Ukraine eventually agrees to formally cede the territories to achieve peace to integrate with the West or maybe it will eventually flame up again in some future state when Russia feels like going again. Likelihood \u2013 moderate (30%).\r\n* c)\tUkrainian defensive victory / status quo ante 24th of February / Minor Russian victory \u2013 a conglomeration of scenarios that entail a Ukrainian liberation of Southern Ukraine (land bridge), while Russia maintains Crimea and some parts of Donbas. Ukrainian offensive is successful in breaking the land bridge. Eventually rolling Russia out from Kherson oblast, but Russia manages to solidify the front before Crimea and in the Donbas. It is unlikely that the war would end this year, as Ukraine would still hope for further gains in the future and Russia has no plans in giving up what they still occupy. As both sides struggle to reconstitute offensive power, the war eventually settles into a stalemate, that either finds a diplomatic solution akin to scenario b (but more beneficial to Ukraine) or remains in a frozen state. Likelihood high (65%).\r\n* d)\tDecisive Ukrainian victory \u2013 Ukrainian offensive is vastly successful, forcing the Russian army into a rout. Ukraine pours reserves towards a push into Crimea and the Russian army still in disarray is unable to stop Ukraine from entering Crimea and establishing overland supply routes. The loss of Crimea, along with the destruction of Russian army in the south is a humiliating \u201ccan not hide\u201d loss to Putin and his prestige. The victory is so substantial that Ukraine\u2019s allies unanimously stand behind a \u201crestore Ukraine\u2019s 1991 sovereign borders\u201d objective, continuing to supply the necessary aid to Ukraine to achieve that.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>People (here and elsewhere) are debating where and how the Ukrainian summer offensive will come and what are the objectives. The predictions ranging from \u201ejust take Tokmak to get the land bridge within HIMARS range\u201c to \u201edecisive battle that will win the war for Ukraine\u201c. So I felt like speculating myself as well.</p>\n\n<p>In short: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I think the offensive will start with a \u201ebang\u201c and try to achieve major mobile breakthroughs.</li>\n<li>I think UAF has decisive objectives in mind, but would pursue them only if the situation develops very favorably and the prime objective is achieved.</li>\n<li>Prime objective is to break the land bridge, reach the sea of Azov and secure flanks.</li>\n<li>Ultimate decisive objective is the successful invasion of Crimea (I know, bear with me).</li>\n<li>Minor objective is to make Russian usage of the land bridge too expensive and hopefully impossible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In a longer form:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Framework of the war, \u201cwargoals\u201d and objectives to win the war.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is my amateur opinion, that this war has 4 main ways it can progress and end.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a)    Decisive Russian victory - Ukraine utterly fails the summer offensive, becomes exhausted from personnel, equipment and materiel losses, in conjuncture with the total collapse of Ukrainian economy and society. Russia finds some new strength: additional mobilizations, air force starts properly working after the exhaustion and destruction of Ukrainian air defense, direct military aid from China. Russia starts pushing Ukraine back and Ukraine agrees to cede South-Eastern Ukraine directly to Russia and cede ultimate sovereignty to Russia, meaning no Western integration, Russia veto in Ukrainian politics, Russian military bases in Ukraine. Likelihood extremely low (1%). I won\u2019t expand on this any further.</li>\n<li>b)    Major Russian victory \u2013 Ukraine fails to make more than minor operational advances in their offensive and exhausts future offensive combat power. Russia likewise is incapable of restoring offensive capability and the war settles to a reduced intensity stalemate-state. Results in a short-term de facto annexation of occupied territories to Russia and either eventually develops into a forever stalemate, Ukraine eventually agrees to formally cede the territories to achieve peace to integrate with the West or maybe it will eventually flame up again in some future state when Russia feels like going again. Likelihood \u2013 moderate (30%).</li>\n<li>c)    Ukrainian defensive victory / status quo ante 24th of February / Minor Russian victory \u2013 a conglomeration of scenarios that entail a Ukrainian liberation of Southern Ukraine (land bridge), while Russia maintains Crimea and some parts of Donbas. Ukrainian offensive is successful in breaking the land bridge. Eventually rolling Russia out from Kherson oblast, but Russia manages to solidify the front before Crimea and in the Donbas. It is unlikely that the war would end this year, as Ukraine would still hope for further gains in the future and Russia has no plans in giving up what they still occupy. As both sides struggle to reconstitute offensive power, the war eventually settles into a stalemate, that either finds a diplomatic solution akin to scenario b (but more beneficial to Ukraine) or remains in a frozen state. Likelihood high (65%).</li>\n<li>d)    Decisive Ukrainian victory \u2013 Ukrainian offensive is vastly successful, forcing the Russian army into a rout. Ukraine pours reserves towards a push into Crimea and the Russian army still in disarray is unable to stop Ukraine from entering Crimea and establishing overland supply routes. The loss of Crimea, along with the destruction of Russian army in the south is a humiliating \u201ccan not hide\u201d loss to Putin and his prestige. The victory is so substantial that Ukraine\u2019s allies unanimously stand behind a \u201crestore Ukraine\u2019s 1991 sovereign borders\u201d objective, continuing to supply the necessary aid to Ukraine to achieve that. Possible developments diverge substantially (from an actual coup/civil war in Russia to nuclear weapon use to god knows what), but this would provide the options for a decisive Ukrainian victory. Likelihood very low (5%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This leaves us with two general objectives/wargoals for each side.</p>\n\n<p>The land bridge \u2013 as long as Russia holds that, Russia wins.

Now, I believe their objective is more modest, but they maintain a significant military presence as a precautionary measure. This is because during the offensive in Kharkov, they were taken by surprise when Russia unexpectedly collapsed. They had to halt their advance to avoid overextending their forces.\n\nIn my opinion, Ukraine has proven themselves deserving of some benefit of the doubt regarding their ability to achieve their objectives.

Ukrainian officials have indicated that they aim to prolong the time it takes for Russia to realize that the offensive is underway.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, their primary objective has become less ambitious compared to what it was in November. Since January, they seem to have reassessed the situation and adjusted their goals accordingly. Now, I believe their objective is more modest, but they maintain a significant military presence as a precautionary measure. This is because during the offensive in Kharkov, they were taken by surprise when Russia unexpectedly collapsed. They had to halt their advance to avoid overextending their forces.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, Ukraine has proven themselves deserving of some benefit of the doubt regarding their ability to achieve their objectives. While they haven&#39;t always emerged victorious, they have shown success when it truly mattered. However, I must admit that I am not entirely convinced about the current offensive. It appears rushed and overly ambitious in nature. Personally, I have a feeling that they might be setting themselves up for failure. Nevertheless, I remind myself of the significant failures Russia has displayed (and ukrainian success), which prevents me from doubting Ukraine too much. It&#39;s just my feeling that&#39;s off with this offensive. In other words, I simply have reservations about the offensive based on my own feelings but ulimately think Ukraine will get the job done.</p>\n</div>",
