They lost at least a few officers  during this attack from several directions but managed to repel the RSF. Baraa Bin Malik Brigade a Islamist group lost one of their top commanders in the battle.\n\nOther news seems the e African Union and the East African bloc are trying to arrange dialogue between the RSF and Junta with some civilian parties boycotting it with the exception of the Islamists ones  feeling they are just acting as a rubber stamp for the army. As a demonstration of how these talks are a charade for both sides to the outside world  Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo leader of the RSF has fired his political advisor, Youssif Ezzat for making a positive comment about the last conference bringing peace. Both the army and RSF are very sensitive  to their base at least when it comes to the idea of this  war being anything other than all or nothing. \n\nIn more depressing news Doctors Without Borders announced its decision to withdraw its staff from the Turkish Hospital in in RSF Khartoum after facing a lot of abuse. It's hard to say if it was the RSF though given the rise of criminal gangs as the state has collapsed.\n\nSeems the RSF have been keeping the pressure up they launched a attack on Babanusa which killed at least 2 SAF soldiers but lost a couple more men. Army is bragging about this but the purpose of this is less to take the city but make sure they don't try to send relief forces out to try and aid the other army garrisons under siege.\n\nhttps://sudanwarmonitor.com/p/5a7\n\n\n\n>A video clip from a member of the Rapid Support Militia, showing their fighting vehicles stuck in the mud due to the heavy rains that some areas in central Sudan witnessed.\n\nhttps://x.com/sudan_war/status/1811859401545785837\n\n> Drones target the southeast of the city of Kosti in White Nile State.\n\nhttps://x.com/missinchident/status/1811836292461666569\n\nRSF shaking down the locals in AL Jazeera.\n\n> The Abu Qouta Resistance Committees reported that the Rapid Support Militia imposed on the citizens of the city of Abu Qouta in the state of Al Jazeera an amount of 70/90 thousand pounds per day under the pretext of protecting the city from \u201ctransparency,\u201d as they put it, meaning thieves, and in the event of non-payment or inability to pay, it threatened them. By leaving protection.\n\nhttps://x.com/sudan_war/status/1811836397793477117\n\nTo further highlight how the term Islamist is thrown around as pr by the RSF they've recently incorporated one from Bashir's government as he's the right type of Arab.\n\n>Hemedti has appointed Hasbou Abdelrahman the former Vice President of Sudan under Bashir and the former Secretary General of the Islamist movement in Sudan as an advisor. Any claim that the RSF is fighting Islamists at this point is beyond ridiculous. Hasbou and Hemedti come from the same nomadic Arab ethnic background that is what binds them; the RSF is an ethnic militia fighting for ethnic dominance and control. It has never had an issue with Islamists in fact the militia existed for more than a decade as the principle violent enforcers for Bashir\u2019s deposed Islamist regime!\n\nhttps://x.com/MohanadElbalal/status/1812035979747774500\n\nHe sided with the RSF when they launched their coup attempt, rumours state he wants to be the governor of Darfur when they take Al fisher. \n\n>The Port Sudan Administration announced on Saturday that it is now ready to hold indirect talks on humanitarian issues with the RSF in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nhttps://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1812103893918048557\n\nCan't imagine that going well but probably a pr exercise for both factions. \n\nSome good news for Sudan one a national level.\n\n>The return of electrical power in some neighbourhoods of Khartoum State after an interruption that lasted for more than one hundred and twenty days.\n\nhttps://x.com/sudan_war/status/1811847782153809970\n\n>Vice chairman of Sudan's Sovereign Council announces that the flow of crude oil from South Sudan to the terminal in Port Sudan will resume at the end of this month, ahead of schedule.\n\nhttps://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1811630558037868738\n\nThis means Sudan can use this money from this oil to help pay for the war and in turn South Sudan has a less a chance of complete financial collapse.",

Unfortunately it&#39;s in ukrainian only. I&#39;ll keep an eye out if he posts something interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Here is <a href=\"https://learn-to-control-yourself.com/blog-ua/\">his blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: some of the highlights. My understanding is he is currently at a military base waiting for military medical commission </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/s/xbW6k9JdNe\">His </a> thoughts and attempts to find a way to not be mobilized. He thought that maybe his eyesight issues could make it so that he would only serve in the rear but no.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/s/YehZp3bYVw\">Here</a> he is talking about his options and in the end he decided to look for a contract position with the AFU as this might allow him to choose his military occupation. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/s/OQABsQoGX3\">Here</a> he talks about meeting a convict. It seems that at least here convicts are mixed with regular mobilized people.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/s/C6J4aRUJq3\">Here</a> he talks about his friends experience with the medical commission. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/s/ujMEBd5zoT\">He</a> talks about how there were rumors about how brutal training centers are however how people who actually went through training said that these were false.</p>\n</div>",

This is probably a dumb question so mods feel free to remove it if need be.\n\nI was tracking the war in Ukraine quite consistently but due to some issues at work I\u2019ve been keeping my head down and haven\u2019t really come across any infos recently about the war since about March or so.\n\nCould anyone kindly summarize anything big that I\u2019ve missed since? From the UAmap it looks like it\u2019s still quite a grind on the front but has there been any real progress from either side? Any new problems whether it be logistical or weapons sales?",
