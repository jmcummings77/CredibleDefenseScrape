What compounds this problem for Ukrainian units is how reliant they are on the crowdsourcing of drones. The majority of Ukrainian units get their drones through crowdfunding rather than from the Ukrainian Armed Forces.*\n\n*Lt Col Pavlo Kurylenko stated that \u201cthe only thing preventing Russia\u2019s breakthrough on all fronts is FPV (first-person view) drones, 90% of which are being provided by volunteers or military divisions themselves.\u201d*\n\n*On the frontline, every drone matters, and soldiers will often do whatever it takes to retrieve the drone, including walking through minefields.*\n\n*The work of aerial reconnaissance depends on the number of drones available in the unit. \u201cThe more drones we have in reserve, the more complex tasks we can perform without fear that our infantry will be left without visual support at a critical moment,\u201d said Shyshola.*\n\n*Despite the best efforts of his pilots, losses are inevitable, particularly since most downed drones were in high-risk areas like the gray zone or near enemy lines. \u201cRetrieving drones on foot was not an option because it contradicts their purpose\u2014preserving lives. So, we decided to find a way to evacuate our drones,\u201d he said.*\n\n*Initially, the team experimented with a drone equipped with a release mechanism.*\n\n*\u201cBut frankly, this plan didn\u2019t work. The lifting capacity of the Mavic and the weight of a drone equipped with a battery were incompatible. We had to drop the hook because it got firmly attached to the drone,\u201d Shyshola said, outlining the early failures that led to further innovation.*\n\n*With time pressing and potential reassignment looming, the team couldn\u2019t delay their efforts. \u201cWe took another drone and taped about two meters of rope to it, with a triple hook at the end made from grenade rings, which we regularly used against the enemy,\u201d he described.*\n\n*Their first successful recovery was a drone just 500 meters away, in a mine-laden area in front of the enemy\u2019s former front positions, in fields mined with everything from anti-tank to anti-personnel mines. After locating the drone in the grass and determining the wind direction, \u201cwe made the first attempt to hook the drone by one of its legs,\u201d Shyshola noted.*\n\n*Shyshola highlighted the challenges of flying with the additional weight of another drone, especially under windy conditions and the drone\u2019s battery limits. \u201cBut flying with such weight was very challenging, as the wind and inertia swayed the rescued drone in all directions. We managed to secure it and had to land along the way, but already in a safe place for us.\u201d*\n\n*This success led to further missions where all previously known lost drones were retrieved in just a few hours. \u201cThe excitement couldn\u2019t be stopped,\u201d he noted, describing how they continued to recover drones throughout the daylight hour. However, they still faced numerous challenges. \u201cSome drones were so damaged they literally fell apart in the air once we were able to lift them off the ground.\u201d*\n\n*There were other times where the drone was struggling to carry the weight and they needed to free the hook to protect the main working drone.*\n\n*Nonetheless, Shyshola and his unit were able to rescue 16 drones, 10 of which were completely intact, including 6 equipped for night operations. The 6 drones that were damaged and not working were sent to volunteer organizations to repair.*\n\n*Shyshola noted that it\u2019s most common for units to have one or a few Mavic drones at once. To have such a large quantity of drones collected for one unit was unprecedented.*\n\n*These efforts are not without their challenges, as electronic countermeasure systems continue to improve, making drone rescue missions increasingly difficult.*\n\n*\u201cThese drones are irreplaceable in modern warfare. Unfortunately, collecting them in such quantities on the battlefield is no longer possible due to the radio horizon, which does not allow descending to such low altitudes at a distance of about 4km,\u201d Shyshola concluded. He further remarked that his unit will continue to innovate and figure out new ways to retrieve fallen drones from the battlefield.*",

However, they still faced numerous challenges. \u201cSome drones were so damaged they literally fell apart in the air once we were able to lift them off the ground.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>There were other times where the drone was struggling to carry the weight and they needed to free the hook to protect the main working drone.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Nonetheless, Shyshola and his unit were able to rescue 16 drones, 10 of which were completely intact, including 6 equipped for night operations. The 6 drones that were damaged and not working were sent to volunteer organizations to repair.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Shyshola noted that it\u2019s most common for units to have one or a few Mavic drones at once. To have such a large quantity of drones collected for one unit was unprecedented.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>These efforts are not without their challenges, as electronic countermeasure systems continue to improve, making drone rescue missions increasingly difficult.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThese drones are irreplaceable in modern warfare. Unfortunately, collecting them in such quantities on the battlefield is no longer possible due to the radio horizon, which does not allow descending to such low altitudes at a distance of about 4km,\u201d Shyshola concluded. He further remarked that his unit will continue to innovate and figure out new ways to retrieve fallen drones from the battlefield.</em></p>\n</div>",

Two Ukrainian colonels accused of participating in the plot have been arrested on suspicion of treason.\n\nThe Ukrainian domestic intelligence agency, the S.B.U., said in a statement that the plot had involved a network of agents \u2014 including the two colonels \u2014 that was run by Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor agency to the K.G.B. According to the Ukrainian agency, the agents working at Russia\u2019s direction were tasked with identifying people close to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s security detail who could take him hostage and later kill him.\n\nThe agency\u2019s statement said the other top Ukrainian officials targeted in the plot included Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the S.B.U., and Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified.\n\n...\n\nThe services said the two colonels accused in the plot belonged to the State Security Administration, which protects top officials. They had been recruited before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to the statement, which identified three F.S.B. members \u2014 Maxim Mishustin, Dmytro Perlin and Oleksiy Kornev \u2014 as running the operation from Moscow.\n\nThe assassination of General Budanov, the services said, was planned to take place before Orthodox Easter, which was celebrated on May 5. The F.S.B.\u2019s network of agents in Ukraine was tasked with observing and passing on information about General Budanov\u2019s whereabouts, the Ukrainian security services said. Once his location had been confirmed and communicated, he would have been targeted in a rocket and drone attack.\n\nWeapons for the attack were provided to one of the colonels, including attack drones, ammunition for a rocket launcher and anti-personnel mines, according to the security services and Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general.

For weapons designed to penetrate the hull of a ship, they utilize a shaped charge that detonates just prior to impacting the ship with the intent of generating plasma to punch a relatively small hole the hull of the ship. The resulting expanding plasma, gasses, and vaporized material within the hull is what really does the damage and results in more effects than just detonating an explosive outside of the hull. Anti-tank weapons do the same thing on a smaller scale and the reactive armor on a tank is meant to explode outwards and disrupt the focus of the shaped charge. Keep in mind, different warheads can be used depending on the goal. A shaped charge detonated at the waterline might be aimed at causing flooding while an omni-directional charge detonated against the superstructure may be aiming for a mission kill.\n\nFor hitting fixed, somewhat hardened targets, or really taking out a building, you want an omni-directional charge that can penetrate an outer layer or two(that is not made of steel) and then detonate. That means engineering a penetrating cap on the tip. You can do this because your target is not a moving metal floaty thing(technical term) with a well defined radar cross-section but instead, a building with a non-metal shell and uncertain metal innards. \n\nThis all means it needs a different navigation and guidance system for it's different flight profile, a different head for the penetrator, and a different kind of ordinance. You can build it on a Neptune platform but there are existing cruise missiles that will do the same job. On the other-hand, there might not be much need for anti-ship missiles at the moment given that the Russian Black Sea Fleet has been keeping their distance so it makes sense to modify and use what you got.",
