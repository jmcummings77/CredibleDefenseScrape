It can still get you angry, but you would be a fool to escape into a simple narrative that relies on a lack of intelligence or empathy.

After the return to Ukraine, the brigade received equipment and ammunition and was fully staffed. During the summer, the 32nd brigade was deployed alongside the 92nd brigade, which had been fighting for the past nine months in the Svatove axis in the northeast of Ukraine.\n> \n> The deployment quickly became problematic and resulted in heavy casualties, eventually forcing the command to reconsider.\n> \n> The training:\n> \n> I\u2019ve spoken to one of the sergeants in the brigade with the call sign \u201cNestor\u201d about the training they received abroad.\n> \n> Overall, the training included basic infantry, reconnaissance, and assault tactics.\n> \n> **Nestor said the most interesting and useful part was the reconnaissance training. \u201cWe learned how to get close to the enemy and build secure observation posts. It was essential.\u201d They also learned how to adjust artillery and navigation. \u201cNavigation was useful; spotting was interesting, but it was not particularly useful on the battlefield so far.\u201d**\n> \n> **However, his overall verdict of the training was mixed: \u201cIt was like the instructors were in a vacuum. We received training in infantry tactics, while this war is a war of artillery and drones.\u201d.**\n> \n> **On one occasion, Nestor\u2019s commander asked if trainers would at least consider the presence of drones on the battlefield. The answer was a damning \u201cNo.\u201d.**\n> \u201cYou didn\u2019t take your drones with you, and the only drone we have available is DJI Phantom 4, but we can\u2019t even use it for bureaucratic reasons.\u201d he recalls them saying. So they continued the training as is.\n> \n> Western-provided training fell short of considering current realities on the battlefield. The brigade\u2019s first deployment in Ukraine was to hold the defense in the Svatove direction. However, Nestor commented: **\u201cOur battalion received zero defensive combat training. It was all assault oriented.\u201d**\n> \n> On a positive note, the sergeant says that our infantry learned to move and storm buildings and trenches. \u201cIf you consider this basic infantry training, it was good.\u201d The infantry companies spend seven days practicing assault combined arms operations, storming different objectives. One day, it was a small town. Another day, it was an enemy trench. \u201cWe went through swamps, mud, and cold nights. Once, our instructor said that living through it on the battlefield would be easier if we experienced these conditions now. He was right.\u201d\n> \n> **But the companies received too little training on surviving the battlefield: \u201cThere was no camouflage training. The infantry didn\u2019t learn how to conceal positions, build bunkers, and no defensive combat training.\u201d**\n> \n> **In the end, Nestor adds that one of the things that they needed was EOD awareness and training. \u201cYou must understand the battlefield is littered with booby traps, mines, and explosive ordinance. We knew it before the deployment. Everyone in Ukraine knows it. We asked trainers if we could get any training on the topic.\u201d But for some reason, the trainers refused to even discuss it. It was a taboo. \u201cWe regret the lack of EOD training specifically. It could have saved lives.\u201d**\n> \n> The deployment:\n> \n> After the training in Germany by a NATO country was complete, and after a short period in Ukraine, they were sent to reinforce Svatove direction.\n> \n> Problems appeared immediately. Nestor\u2019s battalion was deployed shoulder to shoulder with one of the battalions of the 92nd brigade. The 92nd brigade soldier with the call sign \u201cZero\u201d explains, \u201cIt appears that they were trained on another planet. What was obvious to us was a terra incognito for them.\u201d He continues with a story of one of their first encounters with 32nd infantry: \u201cWe were driving 15km from the front line, and I noticed a military Ural (truck), with a full platoon clustered around near one of the small local grocery stores. They acted like they didn\u2019t know it was a war zone. We had to stop and tell them that ZALA (russian) drone was reported around. The platoon commander did not know the enemy had such capabilities.\u201d.\n> \n> **A grave mistake in NATO training was that a company commander stayed in the trenches with the company. While it sounds heroic and may work when facing a poorly equipped enemy, russia is well-equipped and has hundreds of drones. This costly mistake was corrected after they lost a couple of positions. \u201cThe company commander has to have the eyes in the sky. He has to have his own drone stream and communicate with platoon or group commanders.\u201d - It was a costly lesson for Nazar\u2019s unit; \u201cIt cost us lives.\u201d**\n> \n> **I asked why a company commander couldn\u2019t stay in the trench. My friend from the 92nd Brigade explained that when the company commander is in the trench, he becomes another link in the chain of command: \u201cPlease understand controlling 100 soldiers in combat is a hard task. The higher-level commander watches a drone stream and makes decisions. He gives an order to the company commander over the radio. The company commander has to understand exactly what is going on to make decisions and pass orders to the platoons. For that, you need to observe the battlefield from the top. Try sitting under tank shelling and yelling over the radio while being yelled over the radio yourself. It is much more efficient when the company commander has his own command and control room with drone streams coming in. He can make calm and weighed decisions looking at the battlefield instead of listening to what is happening, and it is no longer a game of telephone.\u201d**\n> \n> **\u201cIn the current battlefield, even the group or a platoon commander has to have a tablet with our special map application to be effective, and you can not rely on a stupid enemy anymore. They evolved.\u201d summarizes Nestor, \u201cWe knew none of that, and no one could share the experience and knowledge with us. Now we are smarter, but the price was terrible.\u201d**\n> \n> **Another capability that was undertrained might surprise: driving. It might sound absurd to some, but those familiar with the battlefield know how hazardous and costly even a simple drive toward or away from the front can be. Our drivers must be more experienced in driving at night; driving during the day is too dangerous. Training for night driving operations is critical to avoid casualties and the loss of valuable equipment. It is also emblematic: It may not seem a top priority for NATO training personnel with a shortened schedule. However, its importance must be communicated just like any other discrepancy mentioned here and elsewhere.**\n> \n> Conclusion:\n> \n> **The disconnect of the NATO training leads to a brigade being unprepared on the battlefield. Specifically, the lack of UAV, defensive, mine awareness, and EOD training has led to unnecessary casualties on the battlefield.**\n> \n> **To avoid a similar situation in the future, Ukraine needs to treat NATO training as basic infantry training instead of a complete cycle of brigade/battalion-level preparation. We need to perform post-training exercises and adapt the units to the newest technologies and tactics on the battlefield.**\n> \n> Ultimately, the brigade has gained enough experience to be effective, but the cost could have been much smaller.",

He was right.\u201d\n\nThe three things they learn are basic infantry skills, reconnaissance skills including artillery spotting, and assault skills. And those assault skills training take up \u2153 of their time. To your point, they are learning the advance, the infantry skills and the artillery piece of the advance-hold-repeat. \n\nSo what part is taken out - in whole or partial - for teaching them how to dig and cover a trench, or using a drone for spotting, or teaching EOD awareness? \n\nAnd is it better to teach them there, giving up live fire practice time, or is it better to teach them in Ukraine by their own fellow soldiers? \n\nThis is what I meant by not actionable. It wasn't the right term for it, and that's my bad. I meant: is it the best use of time and resources when both are constrained? And I don't think it is. Once these troops get back to Ukraine and sent wherever they are needed, they can be taught how to build a trench and cover it, build bunkers, use drones, etc. But they won't have the same freedom to train their rifle and assault skills. \n\nThat's the biggest issue with all of this. NATO 3-5 week training is viewed as a solution to Ukraine's force generation problems when really it's just a first step. It's Infantry 101 plus donations (as they go home with their gear). The problem is that Ukraine's Infantry 201, 301, 401, etc. is missing. As far as I read, they're not doing more systematic training either in reserve groups or once they're assigned to a post.\n\nIf Ukraine knows these gaps with the NATO training exist, they should be having a dedicated training course - say 3 weeks for symmetry reasons - to address them. Like I said, you can teach how to build defensive works or use camouflage, or use drones anywhere. Then when they get shipped to their units or stations, they should have additional training from any experienced units there. That way they get that additional conflict and area specific training without having to worry about the basics.",

Maybe there&#39;s been poor communication between NATO member states and Ukraine about what&#39;s actually being taught. Or maybe Ukraine is just too starved for soldiers or don&#39;t have the the capability to provide further training. But I doubt the trainers have designed a course to turn a civilian into a combat-ready soldier in 5 weeks, because the trainers believe that&#39;s not possible anyway.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[The Con-Man Realism of Vivek Ramaswamy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/05/the-con-man-realism-of-vivek-ramaswamy/)\n\n>If a politician wants to convey a sense of gravitas and sound like a serious foreign-policy thinker, they are apt to declare that they are a \u201crealist.\u201d Genuine realists may still be an endangered species in the Western foreign-policy community\u2014not extinct but definitely outnumbered by liberals, neoconservatives, and other idealists\u2014but embracing the realist label is intended to convey a certain tough-minded sophistication about the complex world of international politics. But caveat emptor: Experience suggests that such claims need to be viewed with considerable skepticism.  \n>  \n>Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described his policies as based on realism and restraint, for example, even though he is more accurately described as a faith-based fabulist (and one of the least successful secretaries in living memory). One of his predecessors, Condoleezza Rice, used to write essays extolling a \u201cnew American realism,\u201d but the policies she helped implement and defend (e.g., the war in Iraq, the \u201cFreedom Agenda,\u201d etc.) violated most realist precepts and were opposed by most genuine realist thinkers. Former President Barack Obama called the realist theologian Reinhold Niebuhr his favorite philosopher and occasionally displayed a realist\u2019s sense of prudence, but he never challenged the non-realist strategy of liberal hegemony that had repeatedly backfired before, during, and after his presidency. The moral: Some politicians want you to think they are realists; they just don\u2019t want to act as realism prescribes.  \n>  \n>Given this tradition of misrepresentation, it should not surprise you that Vivek Ramaswamy\u2014the latest slick neophyte to say that he knows how to set U.S. foreign policy right\u2014has claimed the realist mantle for himself. Writing in the American Conservative, Ramaswamy advances what he calls a viable doctrine of \u201cRealism and Revival.\u201d He embraces George Washington\u2019s 18th-century warnings about \u201centangling alliances,\u201d associates himself with the supposedly \u201ccold and sober realism\u201d of Richard Nixon, and defends the principle of hemispheric dominance first espoused by James Monroe in the 1820s. A cursory read of his article might lead the unwary to see him as the answer to a realist\u2019s prayer.  \n>  \n>Indeed, you might think I\u2019d be giddy about Ramaswamy\u2019s shtick, insofar as some of what he seems to be proposing sounds like what I and other realists/restrainers have been advocating for some time. He thinks foreign policy should be designed to advance the national interest (though he never tells us what that interest is). He wants U.S. allies to do more for their own defense (a view shared by every U.S. president since Dwight D. Eisenhower), would like to minimize the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East, and says he\u2019ll drive a wedge between Russia and China. When I read him calling for the U.S. to be a \u201cbalancer of last resort\u201d but not a first responder all over the world, I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s been reading my stuff.  \n>  \n>So why am I not clamoring to get a spot on his team, sending his campaign a nice fat contribution, and writing a column praising his remarkable insights?  \n>  \n>Let\u2019s start with the basics. Foreign-policy realism begins by trying to comprehend the political world as it really is, not as we might like it to be, and that requires an accurate understanding of history and a clear sense of what is politically feasible. Ramaswamy\u2019s article fails on both counts: His analysis and recommendations are glib, shallow, and rest on some dubious historical assertions. Moreover, his confident claim that he can achieve swift and sweeping foreign-policy successes at little or no cost is as dependent on magical thinking as the policies of the neoconservatives and liberal internationalists he repeatedly criticizes.  \n>  \n>True realists see the world differently. In a world of separate states that lacks a central authority, ambitious schemes rarely go exactly as planned or as easily as their architects predict. For realists, foreign policy is a complex realm of chance, contingency, and unintended consequences, and even the most powerful states often find their efforts thwarted by open opposition, foot-dragging, unforeseen accidents, their own mistakes, and the inherent limits of knowledge. For this reason, realists emphasize the need for prudence and warn against efforts to remake distant societies that are very different from our own. Ramaswamy, by contrast, thinks it will be child\u2019s play to get other countries to reorient their foreign policies and restructure their societies according to his dictates.  \n>  \n>His ignorance is also apparent in his choice of historical role models. Invoking Washington is a safe move, of course, and Washington\u2019s famous \u201cFarewell Address\u201d does contain some useful cautionary advice for us today. But an approach to foreign policy that was appropriate for a weak and still-vulnerable republic at the end of 18th century can hardly be applied mutatis mutandis to the strategic decisions that confront the world\u2019s most powerful state today.  \n>  \n>His next role model is Nixon, whom he calls \u201cthe president I most admire,\u201d but his grasp of Nixon\u2019s policies and achievements is spotty at best. The 37th president was no idealist, but Nixon\u2019s \u201crealism\u201d also contained plenty of gaps, limitations, and avoidable errors. The opening to China was classic balance-of-power politics, but Ramaswamy overstates its importance and its overall impact on the Cold War. China and the Soviet Union had been at odds before Nixon went to Beijing, and China was too weak to shift the global balance of power just by making nice with Washington. His claim that Nixon \u201cgot us out of Vietnam\u201d is risible; in fact, Nixon and Henry Kissinger ignored the advice of realists like Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, and George Kennan and prolonged the war to no good purpose for an additional four years. Ramaswamy says he\u2019ll implement his own version of the Nixon Doctrine\u2014which called for the United States to shift security burdens to key regional allies\u2014but he seems unaware that this rhetorical declaration had little impact on U.S. commitments or defense burdens. And some of the key elements of that doctrine\u2014such as a growing reliance upon regional allies like the shah of Iran\u2014ultimately backfired badly. It is also worth remembering that Nixon and Kissinger greatly expanded the overall U.S. role in the Middle East, which is the opposite of the direction that Ramaswamy says he wants to go.  \n>  \n>Ramaswamy\u2019s departure from true realism is perhaps most apparent in his discussion of Latin America. He wants the United States to \u201cre-embrace the Monroe Doctrine\u201d and announce to the world that \u201cour hemisphere is not to be encroached\u201d upon. As an offshore balancer, I don\u2019t have a big problem with that general idea, but what exactly does Ramaswamy mean here? Will Washington bar Chinese investment in South America or tell Brazil not to trade with Beijing? Good luck with that. Is he going to use the 82nd Airborne to tackle drug gangs or punish left-wing regimes? Taken literally, Ramaswamy\u2019s recommendations would entrap the United States in local quagmires for which we have no ready solution. He\u2019s worried about Latin American \u201cleftism,\u201d \u201cunstable states,\u201d drug cartels, and migrants, but his only answers to these challenges are a chest-thumping warning that other states must keep their distance (or they \u201cwill be made to regret it\u201d), to place greater reliance on the U.S. Navy (to do what?), and to propose a bunch of new trade deals. This is foreign policy by bumper sticker, not a serious analysis of the region\u2019s challenges and the different ways the United States might respond.  \n>  \n>Magical thinking is also evident in Ramaswamy\u2019s ideas for remaking the global chessboard. Driving a wedge between Russia and China is a desirable goal, but he seems to think that all he must do to achieve that aim is declare an end to NATO enlargement and concede the occupied portions of Ukraine to Russia. Halting further NATO enlargement would be a good first step, but at this point separating Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping is going to be a lot more difficult than Ramaswamy thinks. Putin has little reason to trust U.S. assurances at this point, no matter who makes them, and what would prevent him from pocketing Ramaswamy\u2019s concessions and then resuming Moscow\u2019s mutually beneficial partnership with Beijing?\n\npart 2 below:",

The moral: Some politicians want you to think they are realists; they just don\u2019t want to act as realism prescribes.  </p>\n\n<p>Given this tradition of misrepresentation, it should not surprise you that Vivek Ramaswamy\u2014the latest slick neophyte to say that he knows how to set U.S. foreign policy right\u2014has claimed the realist mantle for himself. Writing in the American Conservative, Ramaswamy advances what he calls a viable doctrine of \u201cRealism and Revival.\u201d He embraces George Washington\u2019s 18th-century warnings about \u201centangling alliances,\u201d associates himself with the supposedly \u201ccold and sober realism\u201d of Richard Nixon, and defends the principle of hemispheric dominance first espoused by James Monroe in the 1820s. A cursory read of his article might lead the unwary to see him as the answer to a realist\u2019s prayer.  </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, you might think I\u2019d be giddy about Ramaswamy\u2019s shtick, insofar as some of what he seems to be proposing sounds like what I and other realists/restrainers have been advocating for some time. He thinks foreign policy should be designed to advance the national interest (though he never tells us what that interest is). He wants U.S. allies to do more for their own defense (a view shared by every U.S. president since Dwight D. Eisenhower), would like to minimize the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East, and says he\u2019ll drive a wedge between Russia and China. When I read him calling for the U.S. to be a \u201cbalancer of last resort\u201d but not a first responder all over the world, I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s been reading my stuff.  </p>\n\n<p>So why am I not clamoring to get a spot on his team, sending his campaign a nice fat contribution, and writing a column praising his remarkable insights?  </p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the basics. Foreign-policy realism begins by trying to comprehend the political world as it really is, not as we might like it to be, and that requires an accurate understanding of history and a clear sense of what is politically feasible. Ramaswamy\u2019s article fails on both counts: His analysis and recommendations are glib, shallow, and rest on some dubious historical assertions. Moreover, his confident claim that he can achieve swift and sweeping foreign-policy successes at little or no cost is as dependent on magical thinking as the policies of the neoconservatives and liberal internationalists he repeatedly criticizes.  </p>\n\n<p>True realists see the world differently. In a world of separate states that lacks a central authority, ambitious schemes rarely go exactly as planned or as easily as their architects predict. For realists, foreign policy is a complex realm of chance, contingency, and unintended consequences, and even the most powerful states often find their efforts thwarted by open opposition, foot-dragging, unforeseen accidents, their own mistakes, and the inherent limits of knowledge. For this reason, realists emphasize the need for prudence and warn against efforts to remake distant societies that are very different from our own. Ramaswamy, by contrast, thinks it will be child\u2019s play to get other countries to reorient their foreign policies and restructure their societies according to his dictates.  </p>\n\n<p>His ignorance is also apparent in his choice of historical role models. Invoking Washington is a safe move, of course, and Washington\u2019s famous \u201cFarewell Address\u201d does contain some useful cautionary advice for us today. But an approach to foreign policy that was appropriate for a weak and still-vulnerable republic at the end of 18th century can hardly be applied mutatis mutandis to the strategic decisions that confront the world\u2019s most powerful state today.  </p>\n\n<p>His next role model is Nixon, whom he calls \u201cthe president I most admire,\u201d but his grasp of Nixon\u2019s policies and achievements is spotty at best. The 37th president was no idealist, but Nixon\u2019s \u201crealism\u201d also contained plenty of gaps, limitations, and avoidable errors. The opening to China was classic balance-of-power politics, but Ramaswamy overstates its importance and its overall impact on the Cold War. China and the Soviet Union had been at odds before Nixon went to Beijing, and China was too weak to shift the global balance of power just by making nice with Washington. His claim that Nixon \u201cgot us out of Vietnam\u201d is risible; in fact, Nixon and Henry Kissinger ignored the advice of realists like Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, and George Kennan and prolonged the war to no good purpose for an additional four years. Ramaswamy says he\u2019ll implement his own version of the Nixon Doctrine\u2014which called for the United States to shift security burdens to key regional allies\u2014but he seems unaware that this rhetorical declaration had little impact on U.S. commitments or defense burdens. And some of the key elements of that doctrine\u2014such as a growing reliance upon regional allies like the shah of Iran\u2014ultimately backfired badly. It is also worth remembering that Nixon and Kissinger greatly expanded the overall U.S. role in the Middle East, which is the opposite of the direction that Ramaswamy says he wants to go.  </p>\n\n<p>Ramaswamy\u2019s departure from true realism is perhaps most apparent in his discussion of Latin America. He wants the United States to \u201cre-embrace the Monroe Doctrine\u201d and announce to the world that \u201cour hemisphere is not to be encroached\u201d upon. As an offshore balancer, I don\u2019t have a big problem with that general idea, but what exactly does Ramaswamy mean here? Will Washington bar Chinese investment in South America or tell Brazil not to trade with Beijing? Good luck with that. Is he going to use the 82nd Airborne to tackle drug gangs or punish left-wing regimes? Taken literally, Ramaswamy\u2019s recommendations would entrap the United States in local quagmires for which we have no ready solution. He\u2019s worried about Latin American \u201cleftism,\u201d \u201cunstable states,\u201d drug cartels, and migrants, but his only answers to these challenges are a chest-thumping warning that other states must keep their distance (or they \u201cwill be made to regret it\u201d), to place greater reliance on the U.S. Navy (to do what?), and to propose a bunch of new trade deals. This is foreign policy by bumper sticker, not a serious analysis of the region\u2019s challenges and the different ways the United States might respond.  </p>\n\n<p>Magical thinking is also evident in Ramaswamy\u2019s ideas for remaking the global chessboard. Driving a wedge between Russia and China is a desirable goal, but he seems to think that all he must do to achieve that aim is declare an end to NATO enlargement and concede the occupied portions of Ukraine to Russia. Halting further NATO enlargement would be a good first step, but at this point separating Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping is going to be a lot more difficult than Ramaswamy thinks. Putin has little reason to trust U.S. assurances at this point, no matter who makes them, and what would prevent him from pocketing Ramaswamy\u2019s concessions and then resuming Moscow\u2019s mutually beneficial partnership with Beijing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>part 2 below:</p>\n</div>",

Lots of other interesting stuff in the article posted below.\n\n[China Is Honing Runway-Repair Teams: A new report from BluePath Labs reveals how the PLA has been investing heavily in the ability to get its own airfields back up and running following a strike. | DefenseOne | 2023](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2023/09/china-honing-runway-repair-teams/389988/)\n\n[Full Report Here](https://www.bluepathlabs.com/uploads/1/4/1/8/141831836/2023-06-26_rapid_runway_repair.pdf)\n\nMuch like the U.S. military, the PLA is also experimenting with alternative basing methods in case an airfield can\u2019t be restored in time. PLA Army Aviation appears to focus on establishing ad-hoc aviation support points for its helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, and logistical support aircraft. For example, after one joint strike training exercise, a helicopter brigade landed at pre-established remote and dispersed helipads with refueling and refitting capabilities. A temporary base, established with civilian militia support, can sustain between three and ten helicopters at a time. According to the brigade\u2019s chief of staff, this method is being explored because previously the brigade had to make multiple trips to and from their training bases for their supply needs, slowing the exercises and lowering overall efficiency. \n\nPLA Army Aviation is also training for more difficult situations that may come up during a Taiwan conflict. For example, one brigade organized a training operation in which nearly a dozen helicopters practiced flying to an island and landing in a field without ground support. This mimics a situation where they fly out for an operation, their base is struck while away, and they are forced to land at an unfamiliar location.  \n\nPerhaps most interestingly, the PLA also has been training to use a 50,000-metric ton semi-submersible vessel for emergency landings at sea. The ship has three helipads in the mid-section and has been advertised as useful for both civilian emergencies and military cross-regional exercises. This parallels in many ways the concepts behind the U.S. Navy's Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) ships, flexible platforms that can be used in a variety of operations. \n\nFor its part, the PLA Air Force is also exploring alternative options, including landing at civilian airports and even using public roadways as emergency airstrips for fixed-wing aircraft. Nearly a decade has passed since China\u2019s first successful highway landing, at Henan Province\u2019s Zhengmin Expressway. In that 2014 experiment, a fighter, a large transport aircraft, and a helicopter landed on a pre-prepared length of the highway, garnering praise from Chinese media.\n\nAlthough the PLA Air Force has attempted this maneuver at least once more, in 2018, this capability still appears to be rudimentary. Foremost, the Zhengmin Expressway was reportedly built to \u201cClass A Standards,\u201d with support facilities, proper surface standards, and appropriate clearance for aircraft. However, according to Zhu Hongda, former Director of the PLA Air Force Logistics Department, the number of highways built to this standard is woefully insufficient. (Zhu was subsequently removed from a position in the ceremonial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, although the reason was unclear.)\n\nThe issue of rapid runway repair and other basing alternatives mirrors those commonly found in the PLA. Although the organization is building up new capabilities, especially in areas of wartime needs, the PLA still suffers from serious shortcomings in training realism and logistical support.",

The most probable scenario is RU likely pressing or seizing part of the Suwa\u0142ki gap to secure a land corridor to Kaliningrad (see the land corridor to Crimea).\n\nOne might argue, \"Given that PL is a NATO member and considering RU is currently mired in UA, it doesn't pose a genuine threat to PL; thus, the spending is a waste of money.\" However, circumstances can shift. For instance, if Trump were to be re-elected, he might abandon Ukraine, pushing Kyiv into a position where capitulating to Putin becomes the only feasible option. There's also the potential threat of Trump pulling out of NATO (something he hinted at during his time in office). Furthermore, we might be overlooking how Poland's political leadership interpreted their private discussions and the collective response of FR and DE to the invasion of Ukraine. The takeaway for Warsaw from its conversations with Berlin and Paris might be a concerning one: if NATO were to disintegrate and Ukraine were to fall to Putin, and should the Kremlin lay its claim on the Suwa\u0142ki gap, Warsaw believes that neither Berlin nor Paris would stand by Poland. Instead, they might pressure Warsaw to acquiesce to Russia's demands \"to prevent bloodshed\" or for similar nonsense.\n\nSo Warsaw doesn't feel as secure as it might look from the outside. An invasion or territorial annexation by Russia would be extremely costly for PL, prompting Poland's commitment to ensuring that Kyiv never falls to Putin. I'm fairly confident that the majority of the military hardware Warsaw is rapidly purchasing is intended for potential donation to Ukraine should the need arise. This equipment will likely be stored for the long-term. Poland's intention is to be prepared, so that if the US were ever to abandon Ukraine, Warsaw could independently support Ukraine. It's far more cost-effective to continuously pour military equipment into Ukraine to stem Putin than to face the threat of a Russian annexation or invasion of Poland.\n\nIt's worth noting that almost no Poland's kit is of European origin. This is likely because if it were, it would be simpler for France and Germany to pressure Poland into complying with Russia's demands (or not helping Ukraine), should such a scenario arise.",

        "body": "[**Inside Ukraine\u2019s assassination programme** *Its agents have become expert in dark revenge. But some worry a clear strategy is absent*](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/05/inside-ukraines-assassination-programme)  \n\n> THE OPERATION was a month in the making. Yevhen Yunakov, the mayor of Velykyi Burluk, in the Kharkiv region, had been identified as a collaborator with the Russians. \u201cCaucasus\u201d, a special-forces commander, and a group of local officers were given the job. His men watched their target meticulously for days: when he shopped; when and where he moved; the extent of his security. Once they detonated their bomb, from a distance, they disappeared to safe-houses inside occupied territory. The group would return to Ukrainian-controlled territory only weeks later, after the town had been liberated. Yunakov\u2019s body has never been found.\n> \n> Over 18 months of war, dozens of people like Yunakov have been targeted in clinical operations across occupied Ukraine and inside Russia itself. They have been shot, blown up, hanged and even, on occasion, poisoned with doctored brandy. Ukraine is tight-lipped about its involvement in assassinations. But few doubt the increasingly competent signature of its security services. The agencies themselves drop heavy hints. \u201cAny person who betrays Ukraine, shoots at Ukrainians or fires missiles on Ukrainians should understand that they are being watched and will be brought to justice,\u201d says Andriy Cherniak, an officer of HUR, Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence agency. In an interview in July his boss, General Kyrylo Budanov, went further: \u201cIf you are asking about [creating a version of] Mossad\u2026We don\u2019t need to. It already exists.\u201d\n> \n> \n> Mention of the Israeli spy agency animates Ukrainians, desperate for justice. In fact, the origins of political assassination are a little closer to home. Mossad learned much of its craft from the Soviet-era secret police and its founding practitioner, Pavel Sudoplatov, who was born in Melitopol in now-occupied southern Ukraine. In a quirk of history, Sudoplatov spent the 1930s infiltrating Ukrainian nationalist groups, and personally blew up one of their leaders with a chocolate-box bomb.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/05/inside-ukraines-assassination-programme\"><strong>Inside Ukraine\u2019s assassination programme</strong> <em>Its agents have become expert in dark revenge. But some worry a clear strategy is absent</em></a>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>THE OPERATION was a month in the making. Yevhen Yunakov, the mayor of Velykyi Burluk, in the Kharkiv region, had been identified as a collaborator with the Russians. \u201cCaucasus\u201d, a special-forces commander, and a group of local officers were given the job. His men watched their target meticulously for days: when he shopped; when and where he moved; the extent of his security. Once they detonated their bomb, from a distance, they disappeared to safe-houses inside occupied territory. The group would return to Ukrainian-controlled territory only weeks later, after the town had been liberated. Yunakov\u2019s body has never been found.</p>\n\n<p>Over 18 months of war, dozens of people like Yunakov have been targeted in clinical operations across occupied Ukraine and inside Russia itself. They have been shot, blown up, hanged and even, on occasion, poisoned with doctored brandy. Ukraine is tight-lipped about its involvement in assassinations. But few doubt the increasingly competent signature of its security services. The agencies themselves drop heavy hints. \u201cAny person who betrays Ukraine, shoots at Ukrainians or fires missiles on Ukrainians should understand that they are being watched and will be brought to justice,\u201d says Andriy Cherniak, an officer of HUR, Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence agency. In an interview in July his boss, General Kyrylo Budanov, went further: \u201cIf you are asking about [creating a version of] Mossad\u2026We don\u2019t need to. It already exists.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mention of the Israeli spy agency animates Ukrainians, desperate for justice. In fact, the origins of political assassination are a little closer to home. Mossad learned much of its craft from the Soviet-era secret police and its founding practitioner, Pavel Sudoplatov, who was born in Melitopol in now-occupied southern Ukraine. In a quirk of history, Sudoplatov spent the 1930s infiltrating Ukrainian nationalist groups, and personally blew up one of their leaders with a chocolate-box bomb. (He also masterminded the assassination of Leon Trotsky in 1940.)</p>\n\n<p>In modern Ukraine, assassinations date back to at least 2015, when its domestic security service (SBU) created a new body after Russia had seized Crimea and the eastern Donbas region. The elite fifth counter-intelligence directorate started life as a saboteur force in response to the invasion.

It's still up in the air whether Azov has truly been depoliticized through this, and I think that individual variance in the political views of its current members could explain this. Maybe there are a lot of people who do truly espouse fascist or antisemitic views, or joined Azov out of patriotism while not knowing or willfully ignoring the meaning behind the symbols they use, or somewhere in between. Another factor is that as shown by Russia itself, Nazism in the Soviet/post-Soviet legacy generally downplays antisemitism in favour of anti-Russian or anti-Slavic connotations in these countries. Some people might call themselves \"Nazis\" in opposition to Russian colonial dominance, rather than the belief system that a neo-Nazi in Germany or the US might attest to. So I think the characterization of Azov as a far-right militia endorsed by the Ukrainian state is blurry at best.\n\nOf course, complicating this is that Azov members are well aware of the stigma their movement carries, so they will describe their views on the Azov movement and symbolism differently towards Westerners such as English speakers compared to towards other Ukrainians.

So now that is too blatant, so it&#39;d evolve another way i.e. extorting mobiks for a billet not at the front.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a bizarre read when coming from a western military understanding, as they keep fighting even though the corruption resulted in a form of tortured existence for them.</p>\n\n<p>To your question it would doubtful that corruption is diminished. The stated shortage of officers plus whole swaths of infantry being labelled expendable or the large pay discrepancies between them only enforces it further.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "First of all, it's wrong to assert that any of these decisions were mistakes until we know the full results. Especially since we do not have much if any insight into what alternative courses of action were truly viable for the GenStab when they made the decisions in the first place. So your questions are already starting from a misleading premise there.\n\nBut even more importantly, I don't think you are framing the questions correctly because you haven't really defined or understood what a \"mistake\" in this context means. Specifically, a negative outcome does not necessarily mean you have made a mistake in the context of operational planning, which is necessarily a risk-based analysis offering few if any certainties. [The US military defines joint planning in JP-05](https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp5_0.pdf) as, \"[T]he deliberate process of determining how to implement strategic guidance: how (the **ways**) to use military capabilities (the **means**) in time and space to achieve objectives (the **ends**) within an acceptable level of **risk**.\" Thus, planning an operation is inherently a risk-based analysis. JP-05 further specifies, \"Risk is the probability and consequence of an event causing harm to something valued.\" You can express this definition mathematically as `Risk = Probability of Harm x Magnitude of Harm`. \n\nThus, these types of operational decisions are probabilistic and risk-based, with outcomes that are sensitive to random variables, making the process much more akin to poker than to chess. You can look at a poker player's decisions in retrospect and say that they were wrong to make a big bet even though they had a strong hand because the other player had a stronger hand, but that's not really a meaningful criticism in the context of poker where the player quite explicitly has to make the betting decision in the absence of information about the other player's hand. [Hence the classic Star Trek quote Redditors love so much.](https://imgur.com/naSBSMR)\n\nFurther, any probabilistic analysis needs to consider the entire universe of possible outcomes, not just the particular negative outcome with which you are concerned. The decision to keep experienced troops on the line might have been a mistake if you only consider the possible consequences to the spring/summer counteroffensives, but it might not be a mistake when also considering the possible effects on Ukraine's winter defense and a bevy of other issues of concern had those troops been pulled from the line. \n\nA salient consequence of the probabilistic risk-oriented framing is the observation that not all outcomes are weighted the same way in the analysis. A high magnitude of harm risk may warrant a large amount of resources to mitigate, even if it has a low probability of occurrence. If the Ukrainian leadership assessed that the magnitude of harm from a potential collapse on the eastern front during the winter was much greater than the harm of the counteroffensive failing, they could quite rationally have allocated greater resources to avoiding that outcome than appears necessary in hindsight.\n\nSo armed with these definitions, would a risk-based analysis premised on the information available to the Ukrainian GenStab when they made these decisions around December of 2022 definitively show that withdrawing the troops from the line would be the better decision? I would guess not, but we probably won't know for sure until well after the war when the histories are being written.\n\nThe basic premise for the offensive was that western equipment and some brief training would be enough to provide Ukrainian troops with the capabilities of organizing brigade-level maneuvers to conduct combined arms breaching assaults against hardened fortifications held by Russian troops of questionable competence. They accepted two risks beyond the risk that giving the western equipment to green formations would lead to sub-optimal use compared to veterans. First, the risk that the Ukrainians lack many of the enabling capabilities that are essential to NATO operations (e.g. tactical air defense, CAS, medevac, large quantities of de-mining gear, etc.) and the Russians might exploit the resulting weaknesses. Second, the risk that the Russian troops might turn out to be capable of at least performing a reasonably doctrinally sound elastic defense. In retrospect, both those risks may have been a bad bet. In light of those two outcomes, I don't think having veterans in the western tanks and IFVs would have made much of a difference. Some of the initial mishaps that Lee and Kofman describe might not have happened or would have resulted in fewer losses, perhaps, but the overall outcome for the offensive would have been the same. Ukraine simply lacks the organizational and technical capabilities needed to overcome a stiff, well-prepared Russian defense as of yet, at least not without first conducting a long period of shaping operations to attrite the Russian units defending in Zaporizhzhia. \n\nIn any case, I think there was reason to hope back in December that the Russians would mess up the defense as badly as they've messed almost everything else up during this war, and that perhaps the unwise winter offensives would take a serious toll on Russian reserves, so it wasn't a totally bad bet. And it might still turn out not to be a bad bet, when and if the Ukrainians are able to inflict sufficient attrition on the Russians in Zaporizhzhia to achieve a breakthrough, so any conclusions are premature for now.",
