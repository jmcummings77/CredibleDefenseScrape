The military situation in Ukraine necessitates the use of these munitions to aid in the offensive against Russian aggression. By denying Ukraine this vital support, we risk further prolonging the conflict and jeopardizing the safety of innocent lives, as Russian continues its campaign of terror in Ukraine.\n\nThe use of cluster munitions against entrenched troops has proven to be more efficient compared to conventional rounds. By reducing the total number of rounds required for a given battlefield effect, Ukraine would be able to sustain the fight for a longer period, alleviating critical ammunition shortages and barrel constraints. This is absolutely essential, lest Russia reclaim the battlefield initiative and further jeopardize Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity as well as the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians.\n\nThe objections raised regarding the alleged indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and potential harm to Ukrainian civilians are unfounded. Ukraine intends to exclusively employ cluster munitions against Russian field fortifications in open countryside, which is already full of unmarked minefields and unexploded Russian munitions. Ukraine is also committed to marking areas where cluster munitions are used, which would greatly aid future cleanup efforts.\n\nMost importantly, it is clear that Ukraine wants cluster munitions. Russia is Ukraine\u2019s greatest and most immediate threat, as well as the one country that is actually bombing Ukrainian cities and actively killing civilians.\n\nThe reality of war is unclean. We are sitting here, looking on from afar and in comfort, while Ukrainians fight and die for their freedom. We cannot let western self-righteousness interfere with Ukraine's war effort.\n\nI encourage you to support all future efforts that are in support of Ukraine, no matter the cost.",

The gruesome effects of uncontrolled use of cluster munitions are well documented but they still make fewer civilian victims than Russian occupation.

Meanwhile, [there are almost 450 documented cases](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/12/un-report-details-summary-executions-civilians-russian-troops-northern) of violent civilian deaths (summary execution, torture etc.) from six weeks of Russian occupation in just three regions of Ukraine alone. The yearly casualty figures from active and remnant cluster munition worldwide is comparable to the *weekly* mortality rate in occupied Mariupol ([source](https://kyivindependent.com/civilian-mortality-rates-increase-in-mariupol/)) -- not all of which can be directly attributed to Russian reprisals, but much of which *can* be attributed to the reprisals and lack of access to medical care that the Russian occupation has brought. Yearly cluster munition figures worldwide are lower (25%) than occupation figures for a month and a half, from just three regions.\n\nThe idea that unexploded ordnance in areas that can -- yes, imperfectly -- be cordoned off and cleaned up is somehow more dangerous than extrajudicial detention centres (we were just talking about this [yesterday](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-prisons-civilians-torture-detainees-88b4abf2efbf383272eed9378be13c72)) is pretty ridiculous.

The thing I wanted point out, and which I definitely borked, is that, based on the evidence we have so far, the impact of the occupation regime has over civilians' lives is not significantly less catastrophic than that of use of cluster munitions. Consequently, I think that opposing the transfer of cluster munitions out of concern for the well-being of civilians, while simultaneously opposing the transfer of any materiel that could remove a threat of at least comparable magnitude to civilian well-being (i.e. Russian occupation) doesn't make much sense.\n\nEdit: just to expand on that, while it was not my intention to use those figures as an indication of long-term impact, you are absolutely right that estimating long-term impact is a lot more complicated than just that. \n\nAt the same time, it's worth bearing in mind that this is true of the long-term impact of occupation, too. Both historical evidence and recent experience suggest that even an immediate peace along the current line would not be the end of civilian sufferring in occupied areas -- in fact, it would effectively permanently place them under the Russian judiciary system, with no means of legal recourse.

The thing I wanted point out, and which I definitely borked, is that, based on the evidence we have so far, the impact of the occupation regime has over civilians&#39; lives is not significantly less catastrophic than that of use of cluster munitions. Consequently, I think that opposing the transfer of cluster munitions out of concern for the well-being of civilians, while simultaneously opposing the transfer of any materiel that could remove a threat of at least comparable magnitude to civilian well-being (i.e. Russian occupation) doesn&#39;t make much sense.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: just to expand on that, while it was not my intention to use those figures as an indication of long-term impact, you are absolutely right that estimating long-term impact is a lot more complicated than just that. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, it&#39;s worth bearing in mind that this is true of the long-term impact of occupation, too. Both historical evidence and recent experience suggest that even an immediate peace along the current line would not be the end of civilian sufferring in occupied areas -- in fact, it would effectively permanently place them under the Russian judiciary system, with no means of legal recourse. This isn&#39;t exactly a war between the US and Canada; the idea that immediate peace would bring immediate relief anywhere except on the immediate frontline is pure fantasy.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not trying to strawman your argument here, I know this isn&#39;t what you&#39;re saying -- this is a tangent to your point, not an attempt to challenge it.

Then he got discharged, walked from Paris to Spain on a nature walk and documented the whole thing. Then he wrote a book about his wartime experiences.  Did I mention he got a [movie made about himself too?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21990036/). He was a major figure on Instagram, Telegram, etc, before the war started. After it started, it only grew from there.\n\nThe 47th literally wouldn't even exist as a battalion if not for Markus, who used his influencer clout to help get it stood up in April 2002, along with a 25 year old captain who would go on to serve as its CO as a battalion and then XO of the brigade (the same officer Markus described in his resignation letter as immoral).\n\nMarkus then used his internet clout to get the 47th Battalion (I think it was a separate Bn, as I can't find any Bde it belonged to) turned into a regiment in June 2002, with added battalions of tanks and artillery. Then then used his internet clout to get it turned into a full separate brigade later in 2022, with the help of Zaluzhny, who seems to be Markus' sugar daddy (no surprise, since I also recently found out [Zaluzhny is responsible for the UAF's outstanding information operations campaign](https://jamestown.org/program/first-strike-the-political-consequences-of-ukraines-bayraktar-drone-attack-on-russia-backed-forces-in-donbas/)).\n\nAnd then Markus used his internet clout to get it assigned to the strategic reserve as the premier Ukrainian Ground Forces brigade in order to get the absolute very best equipment issued to it that NATO gave to Ukraine: 3x battalions of M2A2 ODS Bradleys and what appeared initially to be as Slovenian M-55S tanks but later those were switched out to Leopard 2A4s and A6s. Plus the best breaching equipment too. Best in the entire country. \n\nWhy did the 47th have such a good reputation even though it apparently didn't see ANY combat higher than battalion level until June 2023? Why was it touted as an all volunteer unit with an excellent NCO corps at NATO standards? Why was it given so much support? Because Chief Sergeant Markus said so on social media, and he had a lot of followers. \n\nAnd the very thing he used to build up the reputation of the 47th, he used to destroy it too, his giant ego. Not the first time an Influencer imploded. \n\nSure, they got mauled in a poorly planned assault. Okay that sucks, but that has happened to some of the very best units in military history. Many of the best UAF units have suffered similar in this war, but managed to keep it silent. Unfortunately, the 47th couldn't keep it silent, their negative exploits were recorded and publicized. Despite not taking his own advice that he [gave to his own troops who were posting on social media after the failed assaults](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/145d1y0/ua_pov_just_shut_up_so_you_dont_have_to_apologize/), he then made the situation infinitely worse and poured gasoline into the fire, Markus went and did his thing, blamed the whole thing on the Bde chain of command. Which utterly destroyed the unit's reputation, likely requiring a total command relief in order to fix it (which is surely what Markus wanted, he knew Zaluzhny is one of his followers who routinely jokingly replies on his fucking [facebook posts](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/06/28/7408922/)).\n\nAt a minimum, he's essentially started a social media civil war in the unit, with followers and haters both commenting now. Awesome job for the senior enlisted professional who is supposed to be responsible for ensuring good order and discipline in the unit. \n\nPeople are in awe of the Ukrainians for their use of information operations in tandem with allowing their servicemen to carry cell phones and record and post at will. However, there is a reason that many western countries and even Russia don't allow this, the juice isn't worth the squeeze because it just takes a single post to cause major screwups. Like taking pictures or posting about barracks. Or criticizing the unit you built in a way that is far more destructive than any Russian propaganda effort could ever match.\n\nAnd to end it all, Markus is STILL in the 47th, he is STILL apparently a chief sergeant meaning he is still responsible for good order and discipline (though not of the whole brigade anymore), and he's STILL posting on goddamn Telegram wishing himself a happy 30th birthday.\n\nHappy Birthday Markus, I hope your wish came true. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://militaryland.net/news/ukrainian-army-forms-a-new-brigade/](https://militaryland.net/news/ukrainian-army-forms-a-new-brigade/)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/04/27/in-1973-israeli-tanks-and-personnel-carriers-worked-together-to-defeat-a-powerful-egyptian-force-ukraines-strangest-brigade-could-borrow-the-israelis-tactics/?sh=47abab8c7b5a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/04/27/in-1973-israeli-tanks-and-personnel-carriers-worked-together-to-defeat-a-powerful-egyptian-force-ukraines-strangest-brigade-could-borrow-the-israelis-tactics/?sh=47abab8c7b5a)\n\n[https://ukrainetoday.org/2023/07/01/47th-mechanized-brigade-path-to-the-breakthrough/](https://ukrainetoday.org/2023/07/01/47th-mechanized-brigade-path-to-the-breakthrough/)\n\n[https://medium.com/@Stefan.Korshak/june-29-day-491-csm-markus-and-messaging-infantry-and-grenades-wo-ist-razman-3d8f7f4594d4](https://medium.com/@Stefan.Korshak/june-29-day-491-csm-markus-and-messaging-infantry-and-grenades-wo-ist-razman-3d8f7f4594d4)",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disclosed the \u201copen and frank\u201d dialogue with Russian officials in a closed-door hearing with Israeli lawmakers on June 13.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems like Iran might not get those promised Russian planes anytime soon, if at all.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iranintl.com/en/202307131696\">Iran Is So Weak, Russia And China Ignore Its Interests - Ex-Diplomat</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He added that the odd stance by Russia is an outcome of Tehran&#39;s imbalanced foreign policy. This was a reference to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei&#39;s \u2018Looking East\u2019 foreign policy which totally ignores the West and pins all hopes on Russia and China.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russia is treating Iran like China is treating Russia. Perhaps that&#39;s what one should except from dictatorships...</p>\n</div>",

Just the other day I was posting about Russia is creating issues with African states by treating them dismissively/jerking them around. Now today we get a story about how Russia is treating their weapons supplier Iran dismissively/jerking them around. For a country in desperate need of support from the global south, they seem to be doing an awfully poor job of getting the global south on side. That's not to say the West is doing any better per se, but one of Russia's key relationship pillars with the global south is their arms industry. If they can't fulfill those obligations or even worse, if they are dismissive about those obligations, then they're not going to be able to rally support from anyone. Other countries looking to support Russia here are obviously going to see this story and balk. Honestly, I sometimes cannot believe that Russia, one of the world's \"great powers\" is doing such a poor job of handling this conflict and its impacts on so many levels. When it comes to diplomacy, I feel like they literally cannot shed this hard-baked mindset that countries come calling to Russia, not the other way around. They act like they're still the Soviet Union, like they can treat these countries like quasi-vassals and just expect them to march to their tune and come calling with tributes, but this isn't the Cold War any more and they're not the Soviet Union. Really highlighting those underlying Tsarist/imperialistic undercurrent of the current Russian admin's worldview and attitudes towards everyone. Fascinating and exasperating at the same time.",

            "body": "Some random thoughts about the topic.\n\nRussia and Iran have had disagreements even during the height of the Syrian civil war. And in most of the cases of disagreement I can remember, Iran was the one that had to shut up and continue the cooperation. I remember there were moments where Iran and Turkey had positions that were not in accordance with Russian interests but I can't give sources about that now. In general, realpolitik, is a thing, so we aren't necessarily seeing something new.\n\nThere is the question of whether disagreements in one direction will mean the stop of cooperation in another. I lean towards the idea that it won't but in certain places, maybe Iran can ask Russia for concessions. Syria maybe one such place.\n\nIn my opinion the Russian position in Syria is reliant on Iran and Iranian assets in Syria itself, Iraq and Lebanon, among other things.  If the Russians do not continue that cooperation with Iran in Syria, I think that this will pave the way for them being kicked out of Syria. Depending on the Turkish position, it might also mean more disagreements between Russia and Turkey. The results of Russia leaving Syria will be against Iranian interests in several directions, too. The fate of Lebanon, Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian minorities in Syria, the Shia crescent, the confrontation with Israel. Again, the Turkish position will also be important here.\n\nI think that Russo-Iranian relations will also stay the same in Central Asia because the Iranians can destabilize the region by arming the ongoing insurgencies there which would put them against Russia and China, assuming that the Russo-Chinese cooperation continues. A small edit: I do not even know what would happen if the powder keg in Central Asia explodes. Russia also probably cannot divert resources to deal with anything big happening there.\n\nWhen I read about the Russian position on these islands, it actually makes sense because I can't remember Russia ever assisting Iran in the Persian Gulf. I have even reached the point where I automatically assume that Russia will work against the Iranian interests in the Gulf or just stay out as a whole based on their actions in the last decade. During the Syrian civil war, the Russians never created enemies in the Gulf even though they were fighting factions in Syria armed by Gulf countries. Some Gulf states themselves have had flexible positions regarding cooperation with Iran (Qathar, UAE sometimes) which I think is relevant because the question of these islands may not be as crucial as we think it is. Also, the current Russo-Chinese policy seems to be the stop the conflicts in the Gulf as a part of their policy towards the US so it makes sense to create a disagreement with Iran, if that disagreement has an acceptable impact but achieves a higher goal.\n\nIn general, I think it is normal that Iran has a very narrow lane where they can operate, especially when you compare them to Russia and China. And this is not something unique with the Russians and the Chinese or with dictatorships, as you said. I can mention a few situations in the past 5-6 years where my country in Eastern Europe was a victim of the realpolitik conducted by France, Germany and the US but maybe I'm mistaken. After all, our allies are partners while the enemy's allies are vassals and puppets.\n\nEdit: something came to my mind regarding Gulf countries foreign policy. Lebanon is a country where both Iranian and Gulf state interests exist among the political elite even though the country is usually discussed only as the base of Hezbollah. As far as i recall from like 3-4 years ago, there were discussions that politicians in Iraq like Muqtada Sadr cooperated with certain Gulf countries.",

Phil explains that the reason why the offensive is stalling is relatively simple: a Ukrainian column assemble for the breach, the Russian Air Force swoops in with Ka-52s and SU-25s and start hitting them with rockets, bombs, and even strafing. Just in 6 months of 2023, the Russians flew around 2300 bombing sorties on Ukraine. \n\nWhy? The Patriots are defending the large cities and the middle and short-range AD are defending the Patriots. What does that leave the front line brigades? \"6 air defence units for the whole front\".\n\nFinally, the previous successful \"counteroffensives\" by the Ukrainians, according to Phil, weren't true \"breakthrough and exploit\". The Russians were thinly stretched and they withdrew or withdrew with good defensive and rear guard actions. He mentioned that while the Russian Air Force may not be that good at responsive CAS on the attack, on the defence, they are doing pretty OK. What's the F-16s will be good for? To chase away the SU-25s; so that the SU-25s can only launch standoff munitions or perform \"one pass, haul ass\" bombing instead of loitering and strafing.\n\nBTW, the link included Phil's report, which was asked to be drafted by the Ukrainian government in order to explain to NATO at Vilnius what Ukraine needs.

Those people described having seen video of a dramatic explosion that destroyed the engine and heavily damaged the test stand infrastructure.\n\n>The company noted it \u201cimmediately\u201d made its customer ULA aware of the incident.

Big companies have to meet their buyer's requirements, and those are usually extensive. The DoD likes its weapons to be highly robust and capable and reliable, and that takes substantial amounts of money.\n\nI'll give an example in the Tomahawk. The DoD wanted a missile that can be fired from surface and submarine platforms, which meant meeting some tight requirements for storage in Los Angeles-class subs (plus having underwater launch capability). They wanted very long range to keep the launch platforms safe. They wanted everything electronic to be rad-hardened (a significant expenditure, mind you). A TERCOM for low level flight. A GPS system with anti-spoofing/jamming. A high grade IMU with low drift over lengthy flight times for redundancy against jamming. An autopilot and actuator system capable of low level terrain hugging. Multiple possible terminal flight paths (dive, horizontal, etc). Target verification scheme (acronym escapes me) to prevent collateral.\n\nUkraine cares about almost none of these requirements. Further, the Tomahawk was made in the 80s. Today we have off-the-shelf products that would make an engineer's jaw drop forty years ago.\n\nCould Ukraine build a budget V-1 rocket? Absolutely. It won't hit the broad side of a barn, but it's probably not meant to. The specifics you mentioned (400km/hr, gas engine, etc), I'd have to evaluate their design. Instinct says they're probably inflating its capabilities more than a tad. But if they want a cheap flying dorito of their own that can hit Moscow and soak up GBAD missiles, then sure, this is doable.",

            "body": "Putin's regime itself has been preserved quite well. Yes, there was the Wagner coup, but there is still no evidence that 1) Wagner could have even made it to Moscow, and 2) that Wagner truly had independence as an autonomous PMC rather than an extension of Russian state operations itself. With Prigozhin either finessed or threatened into submission, there is pretty much no viable successor to Putin, war performance aside. Gerasimov and Shoigu are still in their posts, and the FSB, while clearly penetrated by US intelligence, has successfully suppressed dissenting oligarchs and politicians. In that sense, Putin is probably willing to accept the current state of affairs, even if the special military operation has lasted for longer than he intended.\n\nRemember, the purpose of anything Putin does is to maintain his own power. The prospect of a formerly important Russian province developing the strong civil society capable of ousting corrupt leaders and joining Europe is extremely dangerous to Putin. If Ukraine can do it, why can't Belarus, or even parts of Russia proper? Irredentism is only a convenient way to justify military action against such a province undergoing this - this is why the Ukraine \"issue\" only began after they ousted Yanukovych, and why official Russian communications do their best to this day to deny Ukraine's agency.\n\nFor the above reasons, I think it is of Putin's interest to keep the war going, even if it leads to a stalemate.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Putin&#39;s regime itself has been preserved quite well. Yes, there was the Wagner coup, but there is still no evidence that 1) Wagner could have even made it to Moscow, and 2) that Wagner truly had independence as an autonomous PMC rather than an extension of Russian state operations itself. With Prigozhin either finessed or threatened into submission, there is pretty much no viable successor to Putin, war performance aside. Gerasimov and Shoigu are still in their posts, and the FSB, while clearly penetrated by US intelligence, has successfully suppressed dissenting oligarchs and politicians. In that sense, Putin is probably willing to accept the current state of affairs, even if the special military operation has lasted for longer than he intended.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the purpose of anything Putin does is to maintain his own power. The prospect of a formerly important Russian province developing the strong civil society capable of ousting corrupt leaders and joining Europe is extremely dangerous to Putin. If Ukraine can do it, why can&#39;t Belarus, or even parts of Russia proper? Irredentism is only a convenient way to justify military action against such a province undergoing this - this is why the Ukraine &quot;issue&quot; only began after they ousted Yanukovych, and why official Russian communications do their best to this day to deny Ukraine&#39;s agency.</p>\n\n<p>For the above reasons, I think it is of Putin&#39;s interest to keep the war going, even if it leads to a stalemate. The prospect of a successful Ukrainian state in the EU/NATO, even if it has lost four regions, would still be extremely hazardous. This is also why Russia is fine with blowing up a dam that ensures a stable water supply to their own territory.

Russia has deep richness of natural resources that it can't exploit in its own land. So, you're trumpeting the win of the two things that Russia already has an extreme overabundance of: land and natural resource wealth. If there were arguments to be made about Sevastopol, or the Crimean Peninsula, from a strategic military perspective, Montreux gave Turkey the keys to the Bosporus. And while I'd argue that Erdogan's 'pivot' to the West is nothing but opportunism and no true pivot, it'd be a foolish bet that Turkey would want an alliance with a failing autocracy. Let's also not forget, both Erdogan and Putin will die someday. \n\nAnd what was the cost of this insanity? Becoming the most sanctioned country in the world, their major banks losing access to SWIFT, export controls, the loss of NS1/2, loss of soft power and areas of influence, becoming a vassal state to China, losing much of its military equipment sway over India, Western firms exiting, long-term economic malaise, oil price caps, decaying capital markets, the mass emigration and brain drain of its populace (putting aside demographic issues) and its military reduced to a 2^nd rate power.",

They of course talked about it, but they never brought the issue to UN, they never blamed the government in Ukraine directly, etc. Leonid Ivashov makes a good point on this. [This](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/did-russias-general-staff-miss-warnings-hard-campaign-ukraine) is a good read in general(I also recommend reading both original source, just use translate tool since they're in Russian) but the relevant point for this discussion is this part from Ivashov's open lette. Also worth keeping this was said almost 2 months before invasion. \n\n>The leadership of the Russian Federation has not yet recognized the results of the referendum on the independence of the DPR and LPR, while at the official level more than once, including during the Minsk negotiation process, emphasized the belonging of their territories and population to Ukraine.\n\n>It has also been said more than once at a high level about the desire to maintain normal relations with Kiev, without singling out special relations with the DPR and LPR.\n\n>The issue of the genocide perpetrated by Kyiv in the southeastern regions was not raised either in the UN or in the OSCE. Naturally, in order for Ukraine to remain a friendly neighbor for Russia, it was necessary for it to demonstrate the attractiveness of the Russian model of the state and the system of power.\n\nSo the overall point is that Russia for close to 8 years in its eyes saw genocide being committed, yet did not act in any political/diplomatic way to raise the issue, or to stop it. Why? Because it still saw a political solution to the problem, that I think very much proves that the state had no actual ethical considerations in mind, and were merely used as pretext. \n\nJust to restate for any passerby, this is simply from Russian POV and even Ivashov who is otherwise anti-Putin is a staunch nationalist who puts Russia first sees this. \n\n\"Nazis\" in Ukraine appeared over night for Russia when they invaded, even though by their own accord they were supposedly always there; but yet there was never anything said, or done about it, not in official capacity. \n\nAnother point I'd make is that this is simply looking at it from Russian POV and it makes very little sense, if you look at the events and what Girkin said in 2014 and given his history; you can see that the whole conflict and \"civil war\" was completely manufactured by Russia-supported agitators and even state actors. If you want to get into that, we can do that too; but let's focus on the first point right now.",

Also worth keeping this was said almost 2 months before invasion. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The leadership of the Russian Federation has not yet recognized the results of the referendum on the independence of the DPR and LPR, while at the official level more than once, including during the Minsk negotiation process, emphasized the belonging of their territories and population to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>It has also been said more than once at a high level about the desire to maintain normal relations with Kiev, without singling out special relations with the DPR and LPR.</p>\n\n<p>The issue of the genocide perpetrated by Kyiv in the southeastern regions was not raised either in the UN or in the OSCE. Naturally, in order for Ukraine to remain a friendly neighbor for Russia, it was necessary for it to demonstrate the attractiveness of the Russian model of the state and the system of power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the overall point is that Russia for close to 8 years in its eyes saw genocide being committed, yet did not act in any political/diplomatic way to raise the issue, or to stop it. Why? Because it still saw a political solution to the problem, that I think very much proves that the state had no actual ethical considerations in mind, and were merely used as pretext. </p>\n\n<p>Just to restate for any passerby, this is simply from Russian POV and even Ivashov who is otherwise anti-Putin is a staunch nationalist who puts Russia first sees this. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Nazis&quot; in Ukraine appeared over night for Russia when they invaded, even though by their own accord they were supposedly always there; but yet there was never anything said, or done about it, not in official capacity. </p>\n\n<p>Another point I&#39;d make is that this is simply looking at it from Russian POV and it makes very little sense, if you look at the events and what Girkin said in 2014 and given his history; you can see that the whole conflict and &quot;civil war&quot; was completely manufactured by Russia-supported agitators and even state actors. If you want to get into that, we can do that too; but let&#39;s focus on the first point right now.</p>\n</div>",

This, just, is normal - we use this statistics in calculations - but, I repeat: high cost and shortage. And we are working on it - it was with this priority goal that we created the fund. It turns out that the same Lancet can be ten times cheaper. Maybe the statistics will change a little in favour of misses due to simpler solutions, but the number of uses will increase by an order of magnitude - and there are already ready-made prototypes that will have to go into series.

Maybe the statistics will change a little in favour of misses due to simpler solutions, but the number of uses will increase by an order of magnitude - and there are already ready-made prototypes that will have to go into series. This direction is only developing and in the future will occupy its stable niche.</p>\n\n<p>https://t .me/aleksandr_skif/2789</p>\n</div>",
