That's comparable to the week of February 26, 2024 (1011 people) and March 4, 2024 (1019 people), i.e. when the obituaries of the KIAs in the (very bloody) final phase of the battle of Avdiivka began arriving. MIA notices aren't included in my table to avoid double counting in case they are later discovered as dead; in recent weeks they have stopped counting in a separate category the Wagnerites who are now discovered as KIA, over a year later (around a couple of dozen a week). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b5gmzq/comment/kt6zf4y/) I had elaborated more on the matter.\n\nhttps://t. me/poisk_in_ua/57775\n\nThe coming weeks will tell whether this was a temporary spike or a further upward trend, following sustained Russian attacks in multiple sectors along the frontline. In any case, the amount of Russian losses has never been as high as in 2024, with an average of identified fatalities close to 800 per week. This confirms assessments that the war has never been as bloody as in recent months, which were in all likelihood even bloodier than the Donbas offensive of spring/summer 2022 and the Bakhmut/Soledar campaigns of fall/winter 2022/23. \n\nA few days ago the French Foreign Minister [stated](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240503-france-estimates-that-150-000-russian-soldiers-have-been-killed-in-the-ukraine-war) that according to their estimations, the Russian KIAs during the war were 150,000 so far, which coincides exactly with my personal \u201ceducated guess\u201d as of early May 2024 (as long as the figure also includes the MIAs, as well as those who fought for Russia in any rank: PMCs, convicts, mobilized men from D/LPR etc). That means an average of 190 per day since the beginning of the war. A death toll released by \u201cPoisk in UA\u201d close to 1000 per week (while the weekly average since the weekly amounts began getting published in January 2023 is about 600) is consistent with a daily number of KIAs + MIAs being between 300 and 350. I find it very likely that irretrievable losses according to Soviet jargon (KIAs, MIAs, WIAs unable to serve anymore, POWs - the last category being of very limited size in a historical comparison) are around or even a bit more than 20,000 per month, over the past three months. Which is in turn consistent with Ukrainian estimates of the Russian grouping deployed in Ukraine growing by an average of a handful of thousand servicemen per month over the past few months + a few thousand more, per month, going into the operational-strategic reserves being created in Russia; with Russia recruiting, through contracts, around 30 thousand men per month - a figure supported by both Russian and Ukrainian sources. Russia's ability to absorb and sustain losses is undoubtedly better than Ukraine's, due to the capability of recruiting a multiple amount of people per month, which allows it to replenish its ranks and also to create several new formations. But the amount of \"spare\" men at the end of each month isn't that high, in spite of the undoubtedly generous monthly recruitment figure, because of the very high number of casualties.",

Real objective ratio of KIA is really hard to (impossible really) to know while at war but looking at the effects while at war is the only good metric in my opinion and right now Ukraine is losing the war of attrition.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: My very personal guess is that right now since like beginning of the year Ukrainian casualties have been around 10000 irretrievable while Russian is 20000 does it fall in line with your own estimates?</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with the article at its core (the core being that the cap can be better enforced,) but there are a few issues with the details. For example, the price graph is as of October, at the point where crude prices peaked, and from a less than perfect source. \n\nThe cap was supposed to achieve contrary but simultaneous dual objectives: lower revenue from oil sales, and keep oil flowing through global markets. Personally was against the cap because it seemed like a high risk low reward scenario especially because oil is ubiquitous in the modern world. However, the implementation was well managed to emphasize the second goal, which was/is to keep oil flowing. When you have two contrary goals, you\u2019re inevitably going to have to prioritize one over the other.\n\nAs an example, in October, the U.S. sanctioned two Russian oil tankers, increasing the spread between Urals and Brent and pushing India to reduce its imports from [Sovcomflot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/india-stops-taking-russian-oil-delivered-on-sovcomflot-tankers), the state owned tanker company, down to zero. This stressed the company, reduced the price Russia was receiving for its oil, and decreased Russia\u2019s market share in the oil marketplace. But, with election season upon us, they completely [reversed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-02/india-s-top-refiner-resumes-russia-oil-trade-on-sovcomflot-ships) this pressure in April:\n\n> Indian refiners, however, started feeling more at ease with purchasing Russian crude, even on Sovcomflot tankers, since US officials visited New Delhi earlier last month and said that they never expected the country to stop buying Russian oil, as it was in Washington\u2019s interest to keep energy flowing to prevent supply shocks.\n\nThis follows a well-worn pattern at this point. [This](https://ibb.co/ygzTJHP) is a chart of Iranian oil production, which had crashed under the previous administration, and has now risen to levels last seen almost 6 years ago. Similarly, this admin dithered with Venezuela despite Maduro reneging on the deal for free and fair elections, only recently reimposing oil [sanctions](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-signals-venezuela-oil-sanctions-relief-risk-deadline-looms-2024-04-17/). \n\nNow, the cap is still working in reducing the revenue Russia earns. Urals trade at a ~$14/bbl discount to Brent. That\u2019s above the $60/bbl cap, hence the outrage expressed in that article, but Urals traded at a small premium before the war started, so it\u2019s still a fairly decent discount given how lackadaisical enforcement has been.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with the article at its core (the core being that the cap can be better enforced,) but there are a few issues with the details. For example, the price graph is as of October, at the point where crude prices peaked, and from a less than perfect source. </p>\n\n<p>The cap was supposed to achieve contrary but simultaneous dual objectives: lower revenue from oil sales, and keep oil flowing through global markets. Personally was against the cap because it seemed like a high risk low reward scenario especially because oil is ubiquitous in the modern world. However, the implementation was well managed to emphasize the second goal, which was/is to keep oil flowing. When you have two contrary goals, you\u2019re inevitably going to have to prioritize one over the other.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, in October, the U.S. sanctioned two Russian oil tankers, increasing the spread between Urals and Brent and pushing India to reduce its imports from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/india-stops-taking-russian-oil-delivered-on-sovcomflot-tankers\">Sovcomflot</a>, the state owned tanker company, down to zero. This stressed the company, reduced the price Russia was receiving for its oil, and decreased Russia\u2019s market share in the oil marketplace. But, with election season upon us, they completely <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-02/india-s-top-refiner-resumes-russia-oil-trade-on-sovcomflot-ships\">reversed</a> this pressure in April:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indian refiners, however, started feeling more at ease with purchasing Russian crude, even on Sovcomflot tankers, since US officials visited New Delhi earlier last month and said that they never expected the country to stop buying Russian oil, as it was in Washington\u2019s interest to keep energy flowing to prevent supply shocks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This follows a well-worn pattern at this point. <a href=\"https://ibb.co/ygzTJHP\">This</a> is a chart of Iranian oil production, which had crashed under the previous administration, and has now risen to levels last seen almost 6 years ago. Similarly, this admin dithered with Venezuela despite Maduro reneging on the deal for free and fair elections, only recently reimposing oil <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-signals-venezuela-oil-sanctions-relief-risk-deadline-looms-2024-04-17/\">sanctions</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, the cap is still working in reducing the revenue Russia earns. Urals trade at a ~$14/bbl discount to Brent. That\u2019s above the $60/bbl cap, hence the outrage expressed in that article, but Urals traded at a small premium before the war started, so it\u2019s still a fairly decent discount given how lackadaisical enforcement has been. Most of this discount is down to Chinese and Indian refiners demanding discounts, and leveraging the cap to their benefit. And it\u2019s important to remember that revenue doesn\u2019t equal what Russian companies actually receive in cash for these sales and how much is taxed. There are a variety of issues with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/russia-struggles-collect-oil-payments-china-uae-turkey-raise-bank-scrutiny-2024-03-27/\">clearing</a> trades due to secondary sanctions, and the Russians are taxing the companies at much higher levels, limiting reinvestment, which will have a cumulative effect with time. O&amp;G companies require a lot of capex and general upkeep to retain their profitability. </p>\n\n<p>In general, the West has done a poor job of enforcement across the board. The WSJ reported as recently as March last year that the OFAC was staffed with 4 dedicated employees to monitor sanctions on <em>all</em> countries. For oil, sales of oil tankers still haven\u2019t been curtailed fully, which is the easiest way to stop the dark trade.

Especially as, since you remarked, they already have plenty on their plate with Pakistan, who have close ties with China and plenty of grievances with India.\nFighting for those mountains if that were relevant? Sure. Starting a war out of the blue? You're talking about strategy, where is India's interest in that scenario?

In cases such as the 110th Mechanized Brigade in Avdiivka during the fall/winter, all its maneuver battalions were in battle. Generally, Ukrainian brigades (especially those engaged in the most difficult sectors) have 2/3 separate rifle battalions or territorial defense battalions attached to them (in some cases even more, as in the current case of the 47th Mechanized Brigade - in some cases battalions from a mech/tank brigade might be attached to other brigades too), to strengthen their combat capabilities and infantry endowment. The state border with Russia/Belarus is covered by TDF and separate rifle battalions, protection units of the National Guard, detachments of Border Guards, and some regular units (e.g. the new 13th Jager Brigade should be on the border with Belarus). But in general the amount of forces deployed there is not that large and they are often there for R&R purposes.

It appears that the US is using military aid as leverage for Israel to reach a ceasefire agreement. Essentially saying \"No peace?

Land based anti ship missiles have become too dangerous, and the strait is far too shallow for us submarines to operate in. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278434315301175\n\nI believe the u.s surface and submarine fleet is far more likely to hang around the area behind the first island chain. The water is far deeper and there is more maneuver space to deter the Chinese fleet from leaving the coast. \n\nAs for Taiwan, its two biggest ports today are kaohsiung and Keelung, both of which lie in the deeper water areas. But kaohsiung faces china directly, and will be the focus of Chinese missile attacks. Keelung is in a better situation, but who knows how much they can use the port in the event of war. That leaves the three eastern ports of Yilan, hualien, and taitung. These small cities are on the east coast and should be far more survivable for blockade runners (it also helps that the Japanese island of Yonaguni is only 67 miles to the east of Taiwan\u2019s east coast). However, most of them are poorly connected with the rest of Taiwan, with only Yilan having a major highway to Taipei that could be susceptible to Chinese missile attacks as well. \n\nhttps://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&context=cmsi-maritime-reports\n\nI firmly believe that the Taiwan strait is a complete no go in the event of war. Taiwan has to treat its eastern ports as a matter of national survival. The geographical constraints are enormous, but if Taiwan can find ways to improve on its eastern-western connection, then it will make them far more secure against a blockade",

Land based anti ship missiles have become too dangerous, and the strait is far too shallow for us submarines to operate in. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278434315301175\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278434315301175</a></p>\n\n<p>I believe the u.s surface and submarine fleet is far more likely to hang around the area behind the first island chain. The water is far deeper and there is more maneuver space to deter the Chinese fleet from leaving the coast. </p>\n\n<p>As for Taiwan, its two biggest ports today are kaohsiung and Keelung, both of which lie in the deeper water areas. But kaohsiung faces china directly, and will be the focus of Chinese missile attacks. Keelung is in a better situation, but who knows how much they can use the port in the event of war. That leaves the three eastern ports of Yilan, hualien, and taitung. These small cities are on the east coast and should be far more survivable for blockade runners (it also helps that the Japanese island of Yonaguni is only 67 miles to the east of Taiwan\u2019s east coast). However, most of them are poorly connected with the rest of Taiwan, with only Yilan having a major highway to Taipei that could be susceptible to Chinese missile attacks as well. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=cmsi-maritime-reports\">https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&amp;context=cmsi-maritime-reports</a></p>\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the Taiwan strait is a complete no go in the event of war. Taiwan has to treat its eastern ports as a matter of national survival. The geographical constraints are enormous, but if Taiwan can find ways to improve on its eastern-western connection, then it will make them far more secure against a blockade</p>\n</div>",
