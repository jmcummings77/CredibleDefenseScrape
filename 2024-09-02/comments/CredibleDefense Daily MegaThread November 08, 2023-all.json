As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Unfortunately, I can't find the whole slide set. It lists the issues Ukraine has had with IRIS-T, NASAMS, Crotale, and more general conclusions, which includes concerns about UAVs. There are some basic problems like bad connectors, lack of full technical documentation in Ukrainian, as well as some that are bigger hurdles. A couple that stick out to me are that IRIS-T's TMRL-4D radar takes 15-30 minutes to enter combat mode, and the limit of 9km between command post and launchers. It's an interesting peek into how equipment usage in an actual war can improve those systems, and is surely the tip of the iceberg. I guess we don't hear much about it because no one wants the weaknesses of their equipment broadcasted to potential enemies and purchasers.",

The third design, called \u201cFlight III Combatant\u201d aims to fill the perceived need for a Tier 1-design with substantial missile capacity and reserves to integrate future technologies including laser weapons and drones.</em></p>\n\n<p>And like all modern navies they are expanding their unmanned fleets.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navalnews.com/event-news/indo-pacific-2023/2023/11/what-to-know-about-sea-1905-australias-future-mine-counter-measures-system/\">What to know about SEA 1905; Australia\u2019s Future Mine Counter Measures System | Naval News | November 2023</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navalnews.com/event-news/indo-pacific-2023/2023/11/c2-robotics-speartooth-luuv-hits-capability-milestones-at-navys-autonomous-warrior-event/\">C2 Robotics Speartooth LUUV Hits Capability Milestones at Navy\u2019s Autonomous Warrior Event | Naval News | November 2023</a></p>\n\n<p>Mostly future possibilities, but technology and the options it provides continue to expand.

        "body": "I was hoping to better understand a recommendation I've seen frequently made that purports to be based on an analysis of Palestinian perception of their leaders & how Israel might maximize the likelihood of achieving peace.\n\nThis recommendation involves advocating for Israel to unilaterally attempt to resurrect a peace process by declaring a ceasefire and making concessions to the Palestinian people (they vary, but often pair an unconditional ceasefire with some sort of reckoning around Israel's occupation of the West Bank, to include, depending on the proponent, various ideas ranging from \"stop settlement expansion\" to \"evacuate most West Bank settlements\" to \"end the occupation\", etc)\n\nThere are many reasons folks state for recommending this outcome: moral outrage, questioning of Israel's motives in its response to 10/7, a belief that Israel's current strategy cannot work, etc.But the one I wanted to discuss here is the argument that says, *roughly*:\n\n* Israel finds itself in a position wherein there is no representative of the Palestinian people that both enjoys sufficiently wide support and that is likely willing to serve as a rational partner with whom they could negotiate (1)\n* Israel's behavior (official support for some settlements, insufficient enforcement against other informal settlements & their settlers, generally unfair treatment of the inhabitants of the West Bank, etc) has undermined the credibility of Palestinian leaders who who ostensibly maintain a willingness to negotiate rationally and who otherwise might enjoy popular support (2)\n* By acting in a manner that undermines the credibility of relatively peaceful actors, Israel's behavior empowers other leaders (like Hamas) by lending credence to their narrative: that peaceful negotiations fail to achieve results; that, instead, violent acts are the only mechanism that can achieve Palestinian goals (3)\n* Therefore, if Israel wishes to achieve a lasting peace, they must provide concessions to the Palestinian people which the relatively peaceful actors (e.g., PLO) can then point to as evidence that negotiations with Israel can achieve their goals, which will build their credibility and enable serious negotiations (4)\n\nFor the sake of discussion, let\u2019s set aside the theoretical question of the applicability of this line of reasoning to a pre-Oct7 world. Let's also leave aside the many other arguments one might make in favor of a unilateral ceasefire and Israel\u2019s granting of significant concessions to the Palestinian people.\n\nInstead, I'd like to focus on assessing the above stated argument on its own terms and as it relates to a post-Oct7 world, i.e., a world wherein a little over a month ago Hamas (et al) successfully executed the most deadly terroristic act in Israel's history (and one of the most deadly terrorist attacks in any nation in modern history)\n\nPeople making the argument above suggest that (4) to build the credibility of Palestinian leaders who would support peaceful coexistence, Israel should now make those concessions. But if Israel were to declare a unilateral ceasefire and make long-desired concessions around West Bank policy, wouldn't that have precisely the opposite effect on the Palestinian population's perception of the utility of leaders who advocate for negotiation when compared to leaders who advocate for armed struggle? Were they to leave Hamas largely intact and make those concessions, wouldn't they risk the perception that they have simply confirmed the accuracy of Hamas\u2019 worldview?\n\nOn the other hand, if Israel were to continue in its action, and IF they can successfully significantly degrade Hamas' ability to militarily project power, then following a period of *relative* peacefulness, couldn't they offer concessions to the less militant Palestinian leaders and narratively justify it by pointing to the reduction in violence?\n\nI fail to see how leaving Hamas intact *and* giving long-sought concessions to the Palestinian people in the immediate aftermath of a successful terrorist attack could avoid supporting the narrative that violence is the only practical means for the Palestinian people to achieve their goals. Again, I realize there are many other arguments folks might make to justify advocating for Israel to take those actions. But I don\u2019t understand why the specific argument listed above is considered convincing.\n\nAm I misunderstanding / mischaracterizing it?",

The only thing that changes this reality is if Israel acts in good faith and works towards an actual solution with a tenable Palestinian partner, but instead of doing that Israel has repeatedly undermined the PA to the point where its distrusted. What Israel is doing right now is not going to fix the problem. It's revenge, plain and simple. This isn't a long term solution. You ask why would Israel reinforce violence is the answer, and I would respond that's all they've been doing since Likud took power by taking away any other avenue for negotiation. And anyway, committing mass civilian casualties and burning down what little the people of Gaza have left isn't going to suddenly make negotiations easier.

It was never intended as a concession, quite the opposite.\n\nIsrael evacuated the Gaza Strip because it was not able to adequately defend the settlements in it. Furthermore, the purpose of the withdrawal was not to restart a peace process, but to end the need for one (from an Israeli perspective). To quote from Bernard Avishai's obituary of Ariel Sharon (worthwhile reading regarding this issue) in the [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ariel-sharons-dark-greatness):\n\n>I was in the audience at the Herzliya Conference, in December, 2003, when he announced his intention to evacuate Gaza. Like many others, I was encouraged, if not moved. He had begun using the term \u201coccupation\u201d: if the reality principle could catch up with Sharon\u2019s pleasure principle, it could catch up with anyone\u2019s. Now, after his death, it seems useful for peace advocates in Israel and Palestine to try to mobilize his posthumous reputation as a belated peacemaker to encourage Benjamin Netanyahu to co\u00f6perate with John Kerry. This rehabilitation has already begun.\n>\n>But the evidence that Sharon would have made peace had he remained in control after 2006 is, let us say, weak. His decision to disengage from Gaza and to build the \u201cseparation wall\u201d was not meant to precede a negotiated settlement of any kind but to obviate the need for one. Sharon\u2019s idea was to annex all of Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, the major settlements, Ma\u2019ale Adumim, Ariel, and so on, and to isolate West Bankers on less than half the territory beyond the Green Line.\n>\n>Sharon, in other words, aimed to leave in place most of what he had built\u2014the bypass roads, the towns, the bases, the network of informers\u2014and to hunker down. In effect, his idea was to cut Israel\u2019s losses, its most exposed targets, and simply take what he wanted. He couldn\u2019t care less what the Palestinian Authority wanted. He worried only about what he could sell to the Bush Administration. He said that he would offer the Palestinians an \u201cinterim\u201d deal.\n\nThat interim deal naturally never surfaced. In a sense the pogrom that Hamas enacted against civilians could be seen coming from a mile away. Here we have a city of two million people isolated, economically and politically, from the rest of the world, with no way of ever improving the living standards of its citizens. The deterioration leads to extremists seizing power. The extremists use violence to try and garner attention for their cause (like many other independence movements), but see that over time their cause is gaining less and less traction from others. Even the most erstwhile allies do not really see the point of continuing to promote their cause. \n\nFinally, the straw that broke the camel's back - Israel looks to normalise relations with Saudi Arabia, protector of the two holiest sites in Islam. For a nationalist movement steeped in fundamentalist Islam, it shouldn't have been surprising that the radical wing of Hamas would take action against this happening. The surprising thing is that apparently the Israeli intelligence services completely overlooked this rather sensible geopolitical truth.",

However, I think the bigger influence was at the time most states were admitted there wasn't any fear of loss of independence. \n\nThe first point I noted that the US Federal government got stronger was during the Civil War. At its start, 34 states were admitted into the Union. That's two-thirds of the total today. As you noted, the big issue was Free versus Slave, which was a proxy for who would hold the Federal government branches. And some states did linger for some time before getting admitted. The 14th Amendment really was the first big incursion into states' independence. \n\nThe second point I noted that the Federal government really started to strengthen was the Great Depression and WW2. This was due to the enlargement of social programs that continued through to the Civil Rights era and the Great Society. By that time, 48 states had been admitted with Arizona in 1912 being the 48th. \n\nFor reference, the size of the US House of Representatives also increased (almost) every apportionment until 1911 when it was set at 435. So not only were most of the states admitted, most weren't losing any significant power in the lower House. Interestingly in 1920, reapportionment didn't happen because although the House would have grown, population shifts meant a lot of current members would have lost seats. This led to the Reapportionment Act of 1929, which sets how we do it today, with a small amendment making it automatic in 1940. As an aside, in 1911 the population per representative was 210k. If that were the case today, the House would be roughly triple in size (1,500 members). \n\nSo overall most of the US's expansion was done when the States wielded considerable independence, and admission didn't threaten many other states' influence. They were also less interconnected than today, meaning they weren't threatened as much economically; the main caveat is slavery, which a war was fought over. There were no real social programs until the Great Depression and post-WW2 Great Society, so states weren't worried about a lot of \"their\" money going to support more economically disadvantaged states. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that US States are equivalent to current EU countries. To your point, they were highly culturally similar (or their ruling classes were when inducted), speak all the same language (or their ruling classes did at induction), and generally don't have as strong of self-identity as EU countries. My point was that the US States did value their independence for most of US history, and many still do now, but two critical points in history led to a centralization of power into the Federal Government.",

            "body": "I'm late to the party but I'm familiar with ship tracking and detection avoidance and it can be done via a number of ways. \n\nThe primary means of tracking a ship is via radio-frequency emissions. If the ship is utilizing a radar, it's basically broadcasting its position. This means that passive, omni-directional RF sensors can pick it up and report on its position very quickly. Same with most forms of RF communication. There are some frequencies that are low probability of detection but not that many. This all means that a ship's best way to avoid detection is to enforce RF emissions control. \n\nWithout RF emissions broadcasting its position to the world, you have to shift to active means to find a ship. IR works well when you're 10-20 miles from a target but the sensitivity requirements for the sensors make them fairly unusable for orbital platforms (they're better with in-atmosphere platforms). Satellite based IR has trouble with fine grain resolution for forest fires where the temperature differential is 1000+ degrees F. Military satellite based IR is primarily used for missile launch detection(an even higher temperature differential). The temperature difference between the ship and the water may be 40-80 degrees F, which means it essentially blends into the background of the ocean to satellite based IR. You can get a drone in and see the ship but at that point, you can just identify the ship via electro-optical means.\n\nIn clear skies, you can certainly utilize an electro-optical satellite based sensor but there are a few catches. Sat based EO can only take usable resolution photos of relatively small plots of ocean so you have to know generally where to look to begin with. They also have to be in a very low orbit which limits their sight. They basically have to look directly down through the atmosphere because if they try to look up towards the horizon, the amount of atmosphere between it and the surface increases pretty dramatically and obscures the image. The satellite also has to wait to get to a position were it can transmit the image to a ground station and the images are massive so it takes time to transmit them. This all adds a significant time lag from when the picture was taken to when it can be put in the hands of analyst. From there, it has to be searched. Computers have come a long way with regards to image analysis but the processing time of an image this size is non-trivial. By the time you have a lat/long for the target ship (if it was in the image to begin with), it can be 30-90 minutes time late.\n\nThere are some other direct imaging processes like synthetic aperture radar but there is a reason it's imagery analysis is known as \"blob-ology\".\n\nYou can also use long range HF radar with atmospheric skips to try and find vessels but that can't identify a vessel, only tell you something is there.\n\nThe way you find a ship that doesn't want to be found is you use the HF radar to find a vessel in a (large) patch of ocean that is not running a radar and use that data to task electro-optical and synthetic aperture radar systems to image the vessel for identification. The problem with all this is that at every point all along this path, those sensors can be attacked (spoofed, jammed, shot down, just plain miss the ship).\n\nTLDR: Large ships have options for hiding in the open ocean and the US has been thinking a lot about it for a long time.",

Boston Dynamics is doing important work and their robots are getting GREAT, but theyre in rarified air with some pretty proprietary (and experimental) shit. \n\nThe problem is you can remote control gross motor movements, but honestly gross motor movements are a pretty easy problem to solve. Fine motor movements linked not just to manipulation, but upright stabilization and coordination are the killers. Put another way, the hard part isn't moving your arms. Its your legs, glutes, back, shoulders, and neck keeping you upright, your spine in alignment, and providing a stable platform for your arm liftoff thats the real miracle in human biology. And that is controlled in a TON of different, mostly passive, ways. Your inner ear, for example, is basically a biological gyroscope which keeps you oriented towards up and down without A) using any electricity B) with a minimum of 'moving' parts, and C) while weighing only a few ounces and fitting into a space smaller than the palm of your hand. And thats just one tool. Your muscles also coordinate in ways you arn't even aware of to stand, walk, run, and do fine motor tasks, and all in very complicated ways. \n\nSo yeah I'm sure BD *could* make a robot that is operated in this way, but its not going to really simplify the technology challenge (as the operator wont be providing the most important data inputs) and thus the cost wont be there. Let alone the scalability issue, because again BD's best designs still dont even come close to human capabilities AND are fantastically expensive.",

February 2022 was Ukraine's 3rd time being invaded by Russia in less than a decade. Where the hell was the Ukrainian missile program?

I second TheObviousDilemma's recommendation to read it. The attitude that it's the West's *fault* for a lack of Ukrainian success isn't helpful for Ukraine in the short term (ignores fixable problems) nor the long term (worse relationships with Western officials, grating to the ears of Western public). After all, it's largely thanks to the West that Ukraine has anything to shoot at all.

(I think I've seen higher estimates elsewhere but they were still below 5% each year). The success of Neptun anti-shipping missiles shows it was feasible to develop missiles for other purposes with higher priority.
