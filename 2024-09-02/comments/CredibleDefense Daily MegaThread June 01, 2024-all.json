        "body": "Here we are for the second part of my analysis on the tactical situation of the front line in Ukraine, after the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1d4twji/comment/l6jmx4o/) yesterday.\n\nBakhmut sector. On the northern flank, the 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps is attacking Kalinina. They have had successes in the forest belts to the north-east of the settlement, trying to approach the cattle breeding buildings north of the village, located around Hill 228. As it seemed like yesterday, the Russians have not been able yet to enter the built-up area of Kalinina by attacking from the east, which is defended by the 56th Motorized Brigade and a battalion each of the 24th and 93rd Mech Brigades. Today, however, a very interesting video came out, released by the 56th Motorized Brigade. When I do full updates like this time I don't put links for space reasons, but I will make an exception (NSFL).\n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/15561\n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/15562\n\nA Russian MT-LB crosses the road over the Donets-Donbas Canal to the part of Kalinina to the west of the canal, unloads stormtroopers and leaves. The stormtroopers are later attacked by FPV drones, then there is another video showing the same MT-LB passing over some Russian soldiers. According to the channel that geolocated the video, the MT-LB (which was later reportedly destroyed) allegedly took a wrong turn and got lost, ending up right against Ukrainian positions. It is, in any case, the first geolocation so far showing Russians west of the canal. While the attack actually seems very random, this explanation doesn\u2019t clarify how a Russian vehicle could have crossed the canal in first place: it would imply that Kalinina may have been abandoned by the Ukrainians, at least if the soldiers defending this village were not all having lunch at the same time. We will know more about the situation in the coming days.\n\nFurther south, the 98th VDV Division managed to record another small advance along the Bakhmut - Chasiv Yar railway and capture almost the entire area of the holiday cottages between the railroad and the Kanal District of Chasiv Yar. As a reminder, Chasiv Yar is defended by a quite large grouping: the 41st Mech Brigade, the 225th Separate Assault Battalion, elements of the \u201cKraken\u201d Special Detachment of the HUR (and other units of the latter), elements of the Separate Presidential Brigade (1st Mech Battalion and 23rd Special Purpose Battalion), elements of the 4th Tank Brigade, separate rifle battalions and territorial defense battalions (e.g. a battalion of the 126th TDF Brigade). \n\nAttacks against the Kanal District by Russian paratroopers continued, with numerous mechanized attacks using T-90Ms and BMDs. They succeeded not only in occupying the buildings east of the intersection of Zelena Street with Horbatoho Street, but also the high-rise south-west of the intersection, as well as the one to the north. The Russians have also approached the Kanal District from the south, taking control of the forest belt that goes up to the garages south of the high rises, including the garages themselves. Violent urban clashes are currently taking place in the area of the Vocational School No. 77. The goal of the Russians here is simple: to try to get as many men as possible into the district, more and more, and have them entrenched inside the high rises, making it very difficult for the Ukrainians to attempt counterattacks and regain control of them. In the southern area of the district, the situation is not extremely clear; it is likely that the Russians entered some high-rise buildings, were subsequently pushed back and so on. The Russians' objective in this area is to approach the Kindergarten No. 32 and thus the central part of the district. \n\nThe fighting is really hard, on the Ukrainian side often the positions in the high-rises are held by HUR operatives, who are the ones counterattacking against the buildings under Russian control. Although the bridge over the Donets-Donbas Canal on Koshovoho Street has been destroyed, the Ukrainians have filled the bottom with earth and created an embankment over which even armored vehicles can pass. Ukrainian tanks often enter the district to provide support for their troops and fire at the high-rise buildings where the Russians are, as well as APCs/MRAPs bringing in new troops and supplies and evacuating the wounded. The Russians shell the district with every means at their disposal, but at the same time they complain that Ukrainian drones are hampering their efforts, as well as becoming much more active over the past week.\n\nAccording to Kir Sazonov, a military blogger and soldier in the 41st Mech Brigade, the situation is difficult but the district is holding; the 98th VDV Division has reportedly lost much of its fighting capability and elements of it have been moved to the rear for recovery. Per the observer Mashovets, battalions of the \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\" were attached to the 98th VDV Division to lead the assaults against Chasiv Yar. In the area of Chasiv Yar, for instance, the Assault and Recon Brigade \"Vostok-V\" is active; Boris Nizhevenok, former commander of an assault detachment of PMC Wagner, recently became commander of this brigade. The CVAC has attracted many former Wagnerites, at least in a part of its brigades. The quality of the servicemen of this corps is very diverse: there are indeed very experienced veterans, but also elders who volunteered on an ideological basis.\n\nThe 5th Assault Brigade and elements of the 67th Mech Brigade are defending the terrain south-west and south of Ivanivske, trying to prevent the Russians both from gaining further ground along the Donets-Donbas Canal in the direction of Stupochky and from flanking Ukrainian positions in the heights north-west of Klishchiivka. There are some Russian advances - according to a geolocation published today, the Russians (units of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA are active in this area: the 102nd Motorized Regiment and elements of the 68th Tank Regiment) have advanced about 600 meters along a forest belt south of Ivanivske. As far as I could find, from a MIA notice, a battalion of Ukraine\u2019s new 151st Mech Brigade may have been deployed in this area during May. In addition, the 11th VDV Brigade has consolidated its gains along the canal in both the forest area in the nature reserve south of the Kanal District and around Road T0504, further south. From the forest, they are attempting to cross the canal (which passes underground and into overground pipes in that point) in the direction of the Novy District - currently without success, although Russian sources state that they managed to cross the canal. This area is being defended by the 18th \"Sloviansk\" Brigade of the National Guard. The Kanal District is progressively being surrounded on three sides, and as a result, its future holding is at risk.\n\nOn the southern flank, the Russians have succeeded over the past few weeks in occupying much of Klishchiivka (with the exception of the southern end, which remains a grey area). The forward Ukrainian positions are now in the forest (or what remains of it) west of the village, as well as in the forest belts to the south-west. According to reports from Russian channels, the Ukrainians abandoned their positions in Klishchiivka during the first half of May, firstly near the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway and later in what\u2019s left of the settlement.\n\nThe return to battle of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps allowed to achieve these tactical successes and occupy the ruins of Klishchiivka. The 89th Tank Regiment, a unit of the Territorial Forces, appears to be part of this division, which is also formed by the 1008th, 1194th and 1307th Regiments of the Territorial Forces (in addition to the 57th Motorized Regiment, which should be in the Marinka sector, and the 54th Motorized Regiment, which is being formed). The 4th, 85th and 88th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Corps are attacking from the north, both towards the village and the heights north-west of it - which remain in Ukrainian hands at the moment, including Hill 215. No Russian advances are reported in the direction of Hill 227, further west. In the Klishchiivka area on the Ukrainian side there\u2019s the bulk of the 93rd Mech Brigade, the 22nd Mech Brigade, the 2nd Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade, to which elements of the 5th \"Slobozhansk\" Brigade of the National Guard are attached, as well as TDF units. \n\nThe Russians have consolidated control in the area of the ponds between Klishchiivka and Andriivka and over the \"Alabaster\" railway station, a little further south. The situation in Andriivka, defended by elements of the 92nd Assault Brigade, is not entirely clear. I believe it\u2019s a grey area at the moment, but certainly the two \u201clatitudinal\u201d forest belts (where Hill 220 is) between the canal and the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway are in Ukrainian hands. The village is attacked by the 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps and by the 7th Military Base of the 49th CAA. The 83rd VDV Brigade, as seen yesterday, should have been moved to the Kharkiv sector. There are no Russian advances in Kurdyumivka, where the 177th Separate Naval Infantry Regiment is deployed. In the area, on the Ukrainian side, there are most of the 28th Mech Brigade and the \"Pomsta\" Brigade of the Border Guards.\n\nHorlivka sector. Nothing to write about. Second part below.",

In the Klishchiivka area on the Ukrainian side there\u2019s the bulk of the 93rd Mech Brigade, the 22nd Mech Brigade, the 2nd Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade, to which elements of the 5th &quot;Slobozhansk&quot; Brigade of the National Guard are attached, as well as TDF units. </p>\n\n<p>The Russians have consolidated control in the area of the ponds between Klishchiivka and Andriivka and over the &quot;Alabaster&quot; railway station, a little further south. The situation in Andriivka, defended by elements of the 92nd Assault Brigade, is not entirely clear. I believe it\u2019s a grey area at the moment, but certainly the two \u201clatitudinal\u201d forest belts (where Hill 220 is) between the canal and the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway are in Ukrainian hands. The village is attacked by the 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps and by the 7th Military Base of the 49th CAA. The 83rd VDV Brigade, as seen yesterday, should have been moved to the Kharkiv sector. There are no Russian advances in Kurdyumivka, where the 177th Separate Naval Infantry Regiment is deployed. In the area, on the Ukrainian side, there are most of the 28th Mech Brigade and the &quot;Pomsta&quot; Brigade of the Border Guards.</p>\n\n<p>Horlivka sector. Nothing to write about.

            "body": "Avdiivka sector. In the second half of May, the Russians resumed offensive actions against Ukrainian positions, achieving several successes over the past week. After consolidating control west of Arkhanhelske up to the ponds, the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA is attacking in the direction of Kalynove, while the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps is concentrating its efforts further east, along the H20 Highway, in the direction of Oleksandropil. This area is being defended by the 109th TDF Brigade, along with a battalion of the 129th TDF Brigade, as well as separate rifle battalions. At the moment the Russians have no advances, partly due to the fact that there are numerous Ukrainian trenches in the area. \n\nThe Russians are attacking Novooleksandrivka very heavily - the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA is active in this area (probably some of its battalions are in R&R), recently reinforced by the 137th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA, which returned to battle after around a month and a half of recovery. At the same time, the Ukrainians are defending themselves vigorously: Russian sources report that the volume of Ukrainian fires in the area has increased significantly in the recent days, including with regard to 122mm rockets, in addition to very high drone activity.\n\nRussian units and their armored vehicles succeeded several times in reaching the eastern end of Novooleksandrivka, but proving unable to gain control of the houses there. At the same time, the Russians managed to advance about 1 km northwards, north-east of Novooleksandrivka, along a forest belt. This could also endanger some Ukrainian positions in the area between Kalynove and Arkhanhelske. The Novooleksandrivka area is defended by the 110th Mech Brigade, which is doing a good job after returning to battle, and is supported by the 100th Mech Brigade and by elements of the 111th TDF Brigade as well as separate rifle battalions.\n\nSouth of Novooleksandrivka, near the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway, the 433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA is active, and it recently succeeded in capturing a forest belt south of Novooleksandrivka and a Ukrainian fortification just south of the railway, in the direction of Sokil. According to Mashovets, an additional regiment of the 27th Motorized Division was committed. We are probably talking about the 589th Motorized Regiment, which has some MIA notices in Russian social media. \n\nThe 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA was recently removed from the front line according to Russian sources. Today it\u2019s the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA, back in the battle, attacking towards Sokil. With clear Russian advances: they have succeeded in taking control of the \u201clongitudinal\u201d forest belt east of Sokil, where battles against the 47th Mech Brigade took place last week (that saw extensive use of Bradleys), as, a little further south, of the \"L\" shaped trench along the road between Sokil and Soloviove. The Russians are now able to threaten Sokil directly. Elements of the 90th Tank Division (at least of its units not engaged in the southern flank of the Avdiivka sector) provide support (both armored and infantry) to the other units engaged in action.\n\nLet\u2019s recall that the 47th Mech Brigade, reinforced by separate rifle and TDF battalions, is defending the section of the front between Sokil and Novopokrovske. The Russians over the past week have also advanced about 800 meters along the Balka Ocheretina (a small stream), thus approaching Novopokrovske from the north-east.\n\nThe 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA is attacking towards Novoprokovske from the south-east, with an advance of about 1,5 km in the last two weeks along the forest belts west of Semenivka. The area between Novopokrovske and Umanske is defended by the 68th Jager Brigade, which is conducting rear-guard battles with the aim of slowing the Russian advance in the direction of Novoselivka Persha.\n\nThe 114th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps has managed to fully capture Umanske, on both sides of the Durna River. It is now attacking northwards in the direction of Novoselivka Persha, with limited successes. According to Russian social media reports, some \u201cbatches\u201d of servicemen of the 201st Military Base have been transferred to the 114th Motorized Brigade and to units of the 90th Tank Division to replenish their ranks.\n\nElements of the 90th Tank Division and the 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps are engaged in attacks against Yasnobrodivka: they have occupied most of the Umanske-Netailove Road and are a few hundred meters from the first village. However, the forest belts south and south-east of Yasnobrodivka, including the one close to the road, should still be in Ukrainian hands. Elements of the 71st Jager Brigade are active between Umanske and Yasnobrodivka, while the 25th Airborne Brigade defends the area between Yasnobrodivka and Netailove, along with the 78th Air Assault Regiment. The 53rd Mech Brigade, as far as I could find, has been moved for R&R to cover the border in Sumy Oblast.\n\nThe 9th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps entirely captured Netailove last week. It is now attacking both northwards (in the direction of Yasnobrodivka) and westwards (in the direction of Karlivka). In the last direction, the Russians managed to capture the shore in the eastern end of the Karlovske Reservoir. Currently, therefore, the Ukrainians in Yasnobrodivka are in a \u201cV\u201d shaped strip of land between the two arms of the reservoir. Elements of Ukraine\u2019s 1st Tank Brigade should have arrived in Karlivka as a reserve.\n\nThe Russians are also advancing southwards, capturing the entire area of the industrial zone south of Netailove as far as the course of the Balka Domakha. The situation thus becomes even more complicated for Nevelske, which is almost surrounded on three sides. This area is defended by the 59th Motorized Brigade.\n\nMarinka sector. The situation in Krasnohorivka is very difficult. The Russians control about half of the town. The 5th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps attacks from the south and the 110th Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) from the east. In the last week the Russians have reached and occupied the town hall and the High School No. 2 (in the area north of the brick factory), as well as making advances in the \"Solnechny\" and \"Eastern\" districts (that of the high rises). The situation is unclear for the area of the high rises in the eastern part of the town: over the last two weeks there have been very harsh urban clashes in this area; very likely the Russians control most of them, although at the moment they cannot advance further west. In the north-eastern part, the Russians have arrived near the Central Hospital, which should still be in Ukrainian hands. In the southern part of the town, the Russians control most of the houses, with the exception of the south-western end of the town. \n\nIn the first half of May there had been counterattacks with some Bradleys (and according to Russian sources, with Abrams as well) of the 47th Mech Brigade - subunits of this brigade are not engaged in the town, but the 47th Brigade has never made it a secret that it\u2019s willing to employ its vehicles to support the infantry of nearby brigades if case of need. The Ukrainians also frequently carry out counterattacks inside the town, but mainly with the aim of \u201cextinguish the fires\" and stemming Russian advances, which are in fact slow, though relentless. In April the 21st Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade arrived in Krasnohorivka, and in the last month the 425th Separate Assault Battalion \"Skala\" arrived too, in addition to the units already there (3rd Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade, elements of TDF and of the Border Guards). In general, Russian progress in the town is slow, but in case of loss of the town the Ukrainians would have serious issues maintaining the area around it.\n\nThe situation in Heorhiivka is not clear at all \u2013 it\u2019s actually one of the most \"mysterious\" places on the frontline, more for lack of geolocations than anything else. As far as we know at the moment, the Russians control the village up to the western end of the reservoir where the Osikova River flows. Some Russian channels in recent weeks have reported rumors of advances towards the center of the village, others even to the western part, but this finds no evidence (barring DeepState putting the center in the grey area, back in mid-May). A few Ukrainian channels have been stating that the Russians have increased the intensity of attacks in this direction. The village is defended by the 46th Airmobile Brigade (which is also active south of Krasnohorivka) and attacked by the 103rd Motorized Regiment and the 163rd Tank Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA.\n\nThe situation is stable in Pobjeda, where counterattacks by the 33rd Mech Brigade stopped the advances by the 255th and the 242nd Motorized Regiments of the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA.

                "body": "There have been Russian advances in Paraskoviivka: in the second half of May the Russians captured the eastern half of the small village, defended by the 79th Air Assault Brigade. Interestingly, it\u2019s the 33rd Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA (previously active in Pobjeda, further north) that has made these advances. The 10th Tank Regiment of the same division should also be in the area. Presumably, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade or at least a large part of its subunits may be recovering after the battle for Novomykhailivka. \n\nSouth of the Sukhi Yaly River, the Russians are trying to approach Kostyantynivka (where the Ukrainian 214th Special Battalion OPFOR has arrived), recording some small advances. The 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps, together with the 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th CAA, is attacking in this area, as well as further south, in the direction of Vodiane and the Kostyantynivka-Vuhledar Road (with support from detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade). In the latter direction, the Russians managed to make an advance of about 1 km last week. Other mechanized attacks in the area were repelled by the 72nd Mech Brigade.\n\nVuhledar sector. Nothing to write about.\n\nVelyka Novosilka sector. At the moment, the most difficult in the entire southern area. The 394th Motorized Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division of the 5th CAA, together with the 60th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA, managed to capture most of Staromaiorske, which was liberated by the Ukrainians in late July 2023. Today there remains an Ukrainian presence only in the northern part of the village. Staromaiorske is defended by the 21st Brigade of the National Guard, the 128th TDF Brigade, elements of the 129th TDF Brigade and of the 1st Tank Brigade. Elements of the 11th Brigade of the National Guard recently arrived in the area from the Kherson sector.\n\nIn the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly, Urozhaine is holding better. The village is defended by the 31st Brigade of the National Guard, the 58th Motorized Brigade, elements of the Separate Presidential Brigade (3rd Mech Battalion and 20th Special Purpose Battalion) and the 762nd Guard Brigade of the State Transport Special Service. The Russians control the farms in the southern end of the village; for the time being their mechanized attacks northwards are repulsed by the Ukrainians. At least one battalion of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade is in action in Urozhaine, where units of the 36th CAA (37th Motorized Brigade and 5th Tank Brigade) are also active, supported by detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade.\n\nIn any case, it's unclear what the Russians' goal in this area is, beyond keeping Ukrainian resources engaged. Probably every Russian group of forces has to attack somewhere and try to achieve results, and the GoF \u201cVostok\u201d chooses to do it here, I see no other explanation. The area has pretty much no strategic meaning for the Russians: from the current Russian forward positions inside Staromaiorske to the lines of early June 2023 near Velyka Novosilka there are still more than 8 kms, by the way.\n\nPolohy sector. The Russians (units of the 35th CAA) recorded an advance in the dachas north of Marfopil, in the western bank of the Haichur River, in the direction of Huliaipole; as well as an advance north-west of Myrne, in the direction of Huliaipilske.\n\nOrikhiv sector. Attacks by the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th CAA against Robotyne continue. There should be no more Ukrainian presence in the village, which area is defended by the 65th Mech Brigade, the \"Spartan\" Brigade of the National Guard (subunits of which are being transferred to the Kharkiv sector) and the 141st Infantry Brigade. It seems that some elements of the 11th Brigade of the National Guard have recently arrived here as well. It is difficult to say how much of the village is actually under Russian control - most likely the southern and the western part, and the rest of the village should be a grey area, occasionally reached by Russian assault groups. The Ukrainians are now positioned in trenches just north and east of the village. The latters in particular (in the area of the hazel forest) are being attacked by the Russians very intensely, but at the moment without success.\n\nThe situation in the area east of Robotyne is stable. The 76th VDV Division should have been transferred, at least for the majority, elsewhere. According to rumors from Russian channels, in the future the same fate may befall the 7th VDV Division, at the moment still (at least in its overwhelming majority) deployed in the Orikhiv sector - although Russian rumors reported the 247th Air Assault Regiment of this division being transferred to the Polohy sector, probably for R&R (there are recent MIA notices of its servicemen in the Verbove area, though). Personally, I think the Russian goal is to eliminate at least most of what remains of the Robotyne salient and at that point transform the sector into a relatively quiet one, like Kamyanske, with the 58th CAA deputed to cover these two sectors. But if that\u2019s the case, the Ukrainians will also be able to move several brigades elsewhere: there are still numerous brigades engaged in the Orikhiv sector. \n\nKamyanske sector. West of Nesteryanka, DeepState yesterday notified a Russian advance of about 2 kms along some forest belts. In this area the 19th Motorized Division of the 58th CAA is active; on the Ukrainian side the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade and some minor units. The circumstances of this advance are unclear, but it might be a readjustment of lines, which in this area are not very clear, particularly due to lack of geolocations. \n\nKherson sector / Dnipro River. The situation in Krynky is not entirely clear due to the recent lack of geolocations of Ukrainian positions in the village. However, Russian channels report of attacks against the Ukrainians in Krynky, and Russian artillery continues to attack Ukrainian marines on their way through the marshy islands towards Krynky, which suggests that there is still a Ukrainian presence in Krynky - the Ukrainians should be present in an area near the central part of the village as well as in the eastern periphery, where they had increased the area under their control in April. The 104th VDV Division and the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th CAA are active in operations against the Ukrainian bridgehead in Krynky. In May they were joined by elements of the 76th VDV Division (at least its 234th Air Assault Regiment), which arrived in Korsunka and is taking part in assaults against Ukrainian positions from the west. Let\u2019s also recall that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade is deployed near Kozachi Laheri. Probably the relocation of part of the 76th VDV Division is due to the need for recovery of the assault units of the 104th VDV Division that have been attacking Krynky for months and months, but also to a potential Russian willingness to close the bridgehead issue altogether. At the same time, the Ukrainians are scaling back the Krynky operation in a major way, with fewer and fewer resources committed to it and with elements of the Marine Corps beginning to be transferred elsewhere, such as the 36th Marine Brigade in the Kharkiv sector.\n\nThat's all!",

Elements of the 11th Brigade of the National Guard recently arrived in the area from the Kherson sector.</p>\n\n<p>In the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly, Urozhaine is holding better. The village is defended by the 31st Brigade of the National Guard, the 58th Motorized Brigade, elements of the Separate Presidential Brigade (3rd Mech Battalion and 20th Special Purpose Battalion) and the 762nd Guard Brigade of the State Transport Special Service. The Russians control the farms in the southern end of the village; for the time being their mechanized attacks northwards are repulsed by the Ukrainians. At least one battalion of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade is in action in Urozhaine, where units of the 36th CAA (37th Motorized Brigade and 5th Tank Brigade) are also active, supported by detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, it&#39;s unclear what the Russians&#39; goal in this area is, beyond keeping Ukrainian resources engaged. Probably every Russian group of forces has to attack somewhere and try to achieve results, and the GoF \u201cVostok\u201d chooses to do it here, I see no other explanation. The area has pretty much no strategic meaning for the Russians: from the current Russian forward positions inside Staromaiorske to the lines of early June 2023 near Velyka Novosilka there are still more than 8 kms, by the way.</p>\n\n<p>Polohy sector. The Russians (units of the 35th CAA) recorded an advance in the dachas north of Marfopil, in the western bank of the Haichur River, in the direction of Huliaipole; as well as an advance north-west of Myrne, in the direction of Huliaipilske.</p>\n\n<p>Orikhiv sector. Attacks by the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th CAA against Robotyne continue. There should be no more Ukrainian presence in the village, which area is defended by the 65th Mech Brigade, the &quot;Spartan&quot; Brigade of the National Guard (subunits of which are being transferred to the Kharkiv sector) and the 141st Infantry Brigade. It seems that some elements of the 11th Brigade of the National Guard have recently arrived here as well. It is difficult to say how much of the village is actually under Russian control - most likely the southern and the western part, and the rest of the village should be a grey area, occasionally reached by Russian assault groups. The Ukrainians are now positioned in trenches just north and east of the village. The latters in particular (in the area of the hazel forest) are being attacked by the Russians very intensely, but at the moment without success.</p>\n\n<p>The situation in the area east of Robotyne is stable. The 76th VDV Division should have been transferred, at least for the majority, elsewhere. According to rumors from Russian channels, in the future the same fate may befall the 7th VDV Division, at the moment still (at least in its overwhelming majority) deployed in the Orikhiv sector - although Russian rumors reported the 247th Air Assault Regiment of this division being transferred to the Polohy sector, probably for R&amp;R (there are recent MIA notices of its servicemen in the Verbove area, though). Personally, I think the Russian goal is to eliminate at least most of what remains of the Robotyne salient and at that point transform the sector into a relatively quiet one, like Kamyanske, with the 58th CAA deputed to cover these two sectors. But if that\u2019s the case, the Ukrainians will also be able to move several brigades elsewhere: there are still numerous brigades engaged in the Orikhiv sector. </p>\n\n<p>Kamyanske sector. West of Nesteryanka, DeepState yesterday notified a Russian advance of about 2 kms along some forest belts. In this area the 19th Motorized Division of the 58th CAA is active; on the Ukrainian side the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade and some minor units. The circumstances of this advance are unclear, but it might be a readjustment of lines, which in this area are not very clear, particularly due to lack of geolocations. </p>\n\n<p>Kherson sector / Dnipro River. The situation in Krynky is not entirely clear due to the recent lack of geolocations of Ukrainian positions in the village. However, Russian channels report of attacks against the Ukrainians in Krynky, and Russian artillery continues to attack Ukrainian marines on their way through the marshy islands towards Krynky, which suggests that there is still a Ukrainian presence in Krynky - the Ukrainians should be present in an area near the central part of the village as well as in the eastern periphery, where they had increased the area under their control in April. The 104th VDV Division and the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th CAA are active in operations against the Ukrainian bridgehead in Krynky. In May they were joined by elements of the 76th VDV Division (at least its 234th Air Assault Regiment), which arrived in Korsunka and is taking part in assaults against Ukrainian positions from the west. Let\u2019s also recall that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade is deployed near Kozachi Laheri. Probably the relocation of part of the 76th VDV Division is due to the need for recovery of the assault units of the 104th VDV Division that have been attacking Krynky for months and months, but also to a potential Russian willingness to close the bridgehead issue altogether. At the same time, the Ukrainians are scaling back the Krynky operation in a major way, with fewer and fewer resources committed to it and with elements of the Marine Corps beginning to be transferred elsewhere, such as the 36th Marine Brigade in the Kharkiv sector.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all!</p>\n</div>",

The author argues for de-centralized solution and against repairing the TPPs, as russia can put damage them again at any given time.

But let's be fair, once you're in a war-time blackout you need (very) short-term solutions, fast, as this is an emergency by definition. De-centralizing in itself won't make you invulnerable either (until anyone basically has to generate for their own cooking) and simply trying to \"outbuild\" against an enemy apparently blessed with near infinite ammunition and determination is never going to long-term solve anything.

In a separate poll...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/05/30/israeli-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/#:%7E:text=A%20new%20Pew%20Research%20Center,it%20has%20gone%20too%20far.\">A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 39% of Israelis say Israel\u2019s military response against Hamas in Gaza has been about right, while 34% say it has not gone far enough and 19% think it has gone too far.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Israelis seem unconcerned with isolation or pending genocide charges and are happy with Netanyahu and his current approach, despite it arguably driving extremism in the Palestinian territories and possibly/maybe impacting Israel&#39;s long term security.  Of course, parallels to the American public&#39;s reaction after 9/11 abound.</p>\n</div>",

In Xinjiang, the Uighur population is far less concentrated, there are 11+ million of them, and there's also an almost equal number of other Chinese spread throughout Xinjiang.

At that point it's a matter of corralling the Gaza population, maybe establishing some heavily defended checkpoints between population centers that are well supported by the aforementioned network. Use drones to surveil the population centers and coordinate with checkpoints to make it very difficult for insurgents to build up weapons caches.\n\nThe horrible aspect is that the more isolated Israel becomes, the more likely they are to adopt heavy-handed tactics with regard to Palestine.",

Therefore I don't see a downside for the Egyptian government to having Israeli troops on the border, unless they don't actually want Hamas to be unable to rebuild it's military.",

        "body": "There was a comment that was asking something along the lines of \u201cwhy does it seem that mounted machine guns aren\u2019t as prominent in Ukraine as they seemed like during trench warfare in WW1\u201d by the time I finished typing my response the original comment was deleted. I spent enough time that I figured I would try and still post my response.\n\nJust anecdotally I would agree that they are much less prominent in footage I have seen. I think there\u2019s several reasons for this that are impacted by why a tripod is used (which is what I assume you mean by mounted MGs) and the current environment in Ukraine. To start the primary reasons why tripods are used are:  -they massively extend your range and accuracy. A medium MG like a m240 can effectively hit point and area targets a little under 50% further out when mounted on a tripod. You can also keep that same hold relatively easy with a tripod also as long as you apply the same pressure, from bipods it requires more actual skill in gunnery. -a gunner can receive from a spotter/team leader/assistant gunner more precise corrections or make his own. With a tripod you can say go 5 mils up or 20 mils right and know you\u2019re doing that pretty closely with a flick of your wrist. When firing from bipods the corrections are more something like \u201ccome up a little bit\u201d or \u201ccome up a lot and left a little\u201d. In theory a trained gunner who knows how to use the T&E(traversing and elevation mechanism) on a tripod can gun while blindfold or visually incapacitated if he has someone giving them corrections. -finally in a defensive position you can have tripods set up so that you can essentially fire without thinking. You can set the tripod up so that if you slid it on the traversing bar of the tripod all the way to one side you can be firing directly in front of your line. This is an FPL (final protective line) which is fired during the FPF(final protective fires). Think broken arrow we\u2019re about to be overrun type stuff. FPLs are generally directly in front of your line just outside hand grenade range. I won\u2019t link it because it was so long ago and I could never find it but I remember watching a video of a Ukrainian defense operating a mounted M2s in this fashion with the gunner applying pressure to take the \u201cslack\u201d out of the gun and tripod with the gun \u201cmaxed out\u201d on the far edge of the traversing bar while in compete cover in the trench.  Now during a large chunk of the combat footage I\u2019ve seen from Ukraine the mounted MGs haven\u2019t been as much of a thing as you would picture in things like WW1, WW2, or Korea. There\u2019s probably a lot of reasons for that so I\u2019ll just give my opinions as a machinegunner or observations I\u2019ve read from soldiers fighting over there and think tanks. I think one big reason that someone has already mentioned is the prevalence of drone dropped grenades and FPVs(as well as drones acting as spotter for artillery). MGs aren\u2019t the juiciest targets compared to SAMs, tanks, or SPGs but are generally the most powerful direct fire asset organic to a rifle platoon or company. Remember we are generally seeing the highlights of these drones taking out tanks and a 240 or PKM doesn\u2019t look as good blowing up on Twitter. For a platoon in the defense the juiciest target is often going to be that MG so they are big targets. A MG that\u2019s mounted would need to be incredibly well camouflaged and probably only unmasked via firing during a decisive engagement. This is likely further complicated by the small dismounted attacks that have been effective for both sides. MGs may be having to reveal themselves by firing during attacks that 5 years ago wouldn\u2019t have been thought of as a decisive engagements or meet the engagement criteria for a platoon or company\u2019s MMGs(medium machine guns). Again just personal observations and no stats to back this up but the lines in the war aren\u2019t 100% continuous or fully manned in all areas at all times. These two factors combined likely hampers much of the tripod mounted MGs. Another drastic difference from past major wars like WW1 that you mentioned is the portability of MGs now. If you are tripod mounted and an attack comes from a little different vector and hits your defense in a different way than planned for you can easily rip a modern MG off the tripod and run down a trench line to set up and fire in a different direction. Modern MMGs with optics weigh under thirty pounds. In a platoon defense you could displace from a mounted defensive position and emplace on bipods on the opposite end of the defense in a different direction within 30 seconds or however long it takes you to run. You weren\u2019t gonna do that with a water cooled M1917 or a Maxim gun. That means that some of these videos especially footage from the defense may be guns that were mounted but had to displace to cover a different avenue of approach or fall back to supplementary position. Finally this is extremely anecdotal but in my time working with foreign militaries former eastern block countries on average just seemed to use tripods way less even in training than the U.S. did. This included Ukrainian troops but I also haven\u2019t worked with any Eastern European countries since 2017 or so and have read some after actions from the fighting in the Donbas prior to 2022 that seemed like they actually started using them a lot more especially for defilade fires with grenade launcher MGs which is very common to see now.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There was a comment that was asking something along the lines of \u201cwhy does it seem that mounted machine guns aren\u2019t as prominent in Ukraine as they seemed like during trench warfare in WW1\u201d by the time I finished typing my response the original comment was deleted. I spent enough time that I figured I would try and still post my response.</p>\n\n<p>Just anecdotally I would agree that they are much less prominent in footage I have seen. I think there\u2019s several reasons for this that are impacted by why a tripod is used (which is what I assume you mean by mounted MGs) and the current environment in Ukraine. To start the primary reasons why tripods are used are:  -they massively extend your range and accuracy. A medium MG like a m240 can effectively hit point and area targets a little under 50% further out when mounted on a tripod. You can also keep that same hold relatively easy with a tripod also as long as you apply the same pressure, from bipods it requires more actual skill in gunnery. -a gunner can receive from a spotter/team leader/assistant gunner more precise corrections or make his own. With a tripod you can say go 5 mils up or 20 mils right and know you\u2019re doing that pretty closely with a flick of your wrist. When firing from bipods the corrections are more something like \u201ccome up a little bit\u201d or \u201ccome up a lot and left a little\u201d. In theory a trained gunner who knows how to use the T&amp;E(traversing and elevation mechanism) on a tripod can gun while blindfold or visually incapacitated if he has someone giving them corrections. -finally in a defensive position you can have tripods set up so that you can essentially fire without thinking. You can set the tripod up so that if you slid it on the traversing bar of the tripod all the way to one side you can be firing directly in front of your line. This is an FPL (final protective line) which is fired during the FPF(final protective fires). Think broken arrow we\u2019re about to be overrun type stuff. FPLs are generally directly in front of your line just outside hand grenade range. I won\u2019t link it because it was so long ago and I could never find it but I remember watching a video of a Ukrainian defense operating a mounted M2s in this fashion with the gunner applying pressure to take the \u201cslack\u201d out of the gun and tripod with the gun \u201cmaxed out\u201d on the far edge of the traversing bar while in compete cover in the trench.
