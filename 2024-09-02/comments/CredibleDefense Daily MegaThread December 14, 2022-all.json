By force if necessary. It is actually quite easier than you think. Most of the believers here are tied to their own parish first, their local priest second, and their local church community third. The intricacies of the church governance are not even tertiary in importance to them. If the priest can be convinced to switch it goes extremely smooth, if not then he can be replaced, and the parish will mostly conform, and within a few years most will forget the issue.

The Biden administration also had asserted previously that \u201cdozens\u201d of Iranian technicians went to Russian-occupied Crimea, and Russians were sent to Iran, for instructions on use of the drones.\n\n>\u201cWe are concerned that Russia intends to provide Iran with advanced military components,\u201d Kirby said. He declined to specify what those components were but agreed \u201cthat could include air defense.\u201d Russia\u2019s S-400 air defense system is considered one of the world\u2019s most capable.\n\n>British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, referring to the U.S. statements, said in London that \u201csordid deals\u201d between Tehran and Moscow posed an increasing threat to global security. Britain, he said, \u201cwill continue to expose this desperate alliance and hold both countries to account.\u201d\n\n>The Biden administration announced sanctions Friday on three entities within the Russian military that it said were involved in training and transfers related to the Iranian drones.\n\n>The administration also announced its 27th drawdown of weaponry from Defense Department arsenals to send to Ukraine. The $275 million package includes additional 155mm artillery shells and ammunition for HIMARS, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that have been particularly effective in striking command and logistics posts behind Russian front lines, as well as unspecified \u201ccounter air defense\u201d and \u201ccounter-unmanned aerial systems\u201d equipment.\n\n>Systems to counter drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can include jamming devices that interrupt directional and operational radio signals sent to the aircraft, as well as munitions to destroy them in flight.\n\n>Total U.S. military assistance since Russia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine is nearing $20 billion.\n\n>The Washington Post reported last month that Moscow and Tehran had agreed in secret to begin manufacture of Iranian-designed drones on Russian soil. But with Russia\u2019s stockpile dwindling, and the start of production still many months away, Iran has committed in recent weeks to substantially increase its supply of UAVs to Moscow for the war in Ukraine, U.S. and allied officials said in interviews.\n\n>The sale of additional drones was discussed during at least two meetings between military and diplomatic officials from Russia and Iran in the past month, security officials from NATO and other U.S.-allied countries said. One senior military official briefed on details of the exchanges said Iran had agreed to supply up to 6,000 aircraft, mostly Shahed models of the type used by Russia in attacks on Ukraine\u2019s civilian infrastructure since the summer.\n\n>The military official agreed to discuss the matter on the condition that his identity and nationality not be revealed, citing the sensitive nature of intelligence-collection efforts involved. A second official, from a NATO member state, confirmed that Iran had agreed to supply \u201cthousands\u201d of drones. Both officials also confirmed that Iranian ballistic missiles also were acquired by Russia.\n\n>Russia has relied increasingly on relatively cheap Iranian attack UAVs to supplement its dwindling stockpile of precision weapons. Drones such as the Shahed-136 \u2014 renamed the Geran-2 by Russia \u2014 can travel more than 1,000 miles and deliver small payloads of high-explosives in self-detonating attacks.\n\n>Iran has acknowledged selling drones to Russia but has claimed that was only before the Ukraine invasion. Multiple reports have found fabrication stamps on drone wreckage that appear to indicate dates of component manufacture that would belie those claims.\n\n>The senior military official, citing intelligence intercepts, said Iran agreed to supply designs as well as technical supervision for the planned Russian drone factory, which is expected to be located in the Tatarstan region. Iran is to receive payments of up to $1 billion, in addition to other, still unknown inducements, the official said.\n\nNot sure if Ukraine did shoot down all 14 of 14 Shaheds today, but their competency against the drones does seem to be increasing substantially. Secondly, this brings into question Israel and what their view of this growing partnership is going to be. Israel has shown the ability and desire to strike Iranian targets almost at will. Third, while ATACMS is always the area where focus turns to whenever this issue comes up, do wonder if the U.S. will be pressured to provide other offensive weapons to Ukraine, namely in the form of the stripped-down Gray Eagle (yes, we get all the issues with it, no weapon is bereft of drawbacks).",

Both systems are meant to be deployed as whole battalions (controlling one battery or \u201csystem\u201d at a minimum). \n\nThe requirements are thus the same as for S-300. It is a lot of different people you need to train (several hundred at least) but all of that can be done in parallel. If the manuals could be translated fast enough, then the training would be relatively straightforward, especially for S-300 veterans (unfortunately for some other weapons we\u2019ve received, none of that has been done, and we were forced to make translations of them ourselves). Of course it\u2019s not the same as operator level training for tanks or artillery, and would probably take months at a minimum. I don\u2019t expect them to be ready at least until spring, which is not too great but okay - this business will last for some time after.\n\nI will end with saying that it will also depend a lot on which Patriot it is going to be. PAC-2 are just somewhat worse S-300P (objectively), at least without integration with AWACS and other air/ground surveillance assets.

But considering that even S-300V were able to intercept Iskanders (not 100% obviously), they could strengthen the perimeter significantly and allow shifting other assets where they perform better.\n\nBut all in all both are essential for long-term stability of the air defence system.
