They don't, broadly speaking, have any real interest in relinquishing Taiwan's de facto sovreignty and have, for the most part, strongly opposed a Hong Kong-style \"one country, two systems\" merger with the CCP (especially after seeing how well that went for Hong Kong). Its more of a matter of that they are more uniformly opposed to \"killing the dream\", so to speak, of a unified China than the DPP and TPP are.\n\nOverall, this makes  KMT-affiliated officials less likely to test the limits on topics such as discussing Taiwan's de jure independence.

Eg. airstriking a command post and then striking again if it turns out the enemy general is injured but not killed?\r  \n\nAbsolutely legal. Same principle as whether you can keep shooting to sink an enemy ship despite already hit it and having wounded many of the crew. \n\n>An infantry soldier losing a leg is obviously hors de combat?\r  \n\r \nAn Infantryman might still be capable of fighting even if losing a leg. I personally know of soldiers who suffered traumatic amputations and still continued doing their jobs, to include holding a weapon.\n\n>Is it legal to \"double check\" that enemies are dead by continuing to shoot at enemies who were wounded but not killed in the initial attack?\n\nIt's called many names, dead check, double tap, anchor shots, security shots, etc. Legal in certain circumstances.\n\nOne popular example to serve as a legal test is \"assaulting an objective,\" that is a dismounted attack through an enemy position, killing them as you advance. \n\nIt's regularly taught unofficially in US military infantry training (you won't find it in any field manual) that it's fine to kill everyone you can see during the first sweep, but if you go back afterwards and kill the wounded then that's murder. \n\nDuring both of my Iraq deployments I was unclear on this. Based on my understanding of Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and our Rules of Engagement (ROE), the training lesson seemed fishy, it didn't sound right, it sounded like the \"The Geneva Convention bans the use an M2 .50 call against people, so aim at their belt buckle and claim you're aiming at government property.\" Horseshit, but repeated **a lot** in the US military, especially before the GWOT started, which was the point we were regularly shooting lots of people with .50 call and nobody cared.\n\nHowever years after I got out of the Army I got a chance to speak to a retired lieutenant colonel who was a lawyer and advisor on LOAC to senior military commands in Iraq and Afghanistan who finally clued me into how the law really works. \n\nLegal custom is based on the need to provide proof, so killing the wounded isn't a crime unless a statute was violated, and there is proof. So it becomes a war crime when there is evidence that the wounded individual is incapable of fighting back. But what does that even really mean? There is no crystal clear definition, it's a legal gray area, because the answer is \"it depends.\"\n\nSo unless a wounded enemy makes it blatantly obvious to a potential shooter (and witnesses) that they are hors de combat, then it's okay to kill them because they are still technically a threat unless it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that they aren't. \n\nCan the shooter articulate and give a good reason why they shot them? If so, that's that. \n\nHence why when assaulting across an objective you can kill all identified combatants on your first sweep across. But if you see them and go past them without killing them but later come back to kill them, how was it that they weren't a threat enough to warrant killing them when you passed them the first time? That alone creates doubt, and doubt can lead to charges and sometimes convictions.",

I personally know of soldiers who suffered traumatic amputations and still continued doing their jobs, to include holding a weapon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it legal to &quot;double check&quot; that enemies are dead by continuing to shoot at enemies who were wounded but not killed in the initial attack?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s called many names, dead check, double tap, anchor shots, security shots, etc. Legal in certain circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>One popular example to serve as a legal test is &quot;assaulting an objective,&quot; that is a dismounted attack through an enemy position, killing them as you advance. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s regularly taught unofficially in US military infantry training (you won&#39;t find it in any field manual) that it&#39;s fine to kill everyone you can see during the first sweep, but if you go back afterwards and kill the wounded then that&#39;s murder. </p>\n\n<p>During both of my Iraq deployments I was unclear on this. Based on my understanding of Laws of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and our Rules of Engagement (ROE), the training lesson seemed fishy, it didn&#39;t sound right, it sounded like the &quot;The Geneva Convention bans the use an M2 .50 call against people, so aim at their belt buckle and claim you&#39;re aiming at government property.&quot; Horseshit, but repeated <strong>a lot</strong> in the US military, especially before the GWOT started, which was the point we were regularly shooting lots of people with .50 call and nobody cared.</p>\n\n<p>However years after I got out of the Army I got a chance to speak to a retired lieutenant colonel who was a lawyer and advisor on LOAC to senior military commands in Iraq and Afghanistan who finally clued me into how the law really works. </p>\n\n<p>Legal custom is based on the need to provide proof, so killing the wounded isn&#39;t a crime unless a statute was violated, and there is proof. So it becomes a war crime when there is evidence that the wounded individual is incapable of fighting back. But what does that even really mean? There is no crystal clear definition, it&#39;s a legal gray area, because the answer is &quot;it depends.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So unless a wounded enemy makes it blatantly obvious to a potential shooter (and witnesses) that they are hors de combat, then it&#39;s okay to kill them because they are still technically a threat unless it&#39;s clear beyond a reasonable doubt that they aren&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>Can the shooter articulate and give a good reason why they shot them? If so, that&#39;s that. </p>\n\n<p>Hence why when assaulting across an objective you can kill all identified combatants on your first sweep across. But if you see them and go past them without killing them but later come back to kill them, how was it that they weren&#39;t a threat enough to warrant killing them when you passed them the first time? That alone creates doubt, and doubt can lead to charges and sometimes convictions.</p>\n</div>",

Requiring WAY more than what Ukraine has allocated (two beaten up Marine brigades who have been on the offensive since June). \n\nThat economy of force defense is why the Ukrainian cross river \"bridgehead\" has succeeded so far. There were barely any Russians in the area, the ones there weren't good, not many in reserves either to counterattack. \n\nBut at the same time the Ukrainians don't even have a bridge for their bridgehead, they moved maybe a battalion of mostly dismounted troops, supposedly with one BTR and a couple Humvees, the more they bring across the harder it is to resupply, and they can't lay a pontoon bridge due to Russian PGMs. So small boats and maybe some pontoon ferries down the road, but that's it. \n\nThey now have a toehold into the town of Krynky, but still need to take the whole town, then the big ass forest surrounding it. Then advance west to take the only real road leading out of it, to then reach the main road (which is what their operational axis will need to follow as follow on supply lines), which then leads to the aforementioned Russian prepared strongpoints that were built in depth all the way to the Isthmus of Perekop, 75 kilometers away as the crow flies. That'll require a full corps, with all their artillery over, AFVs, and they'll all need to be well supplied to advance.\n\nThe Russians are holding back because the Krynky Bridgehead is currently useless for everything minus UA information operations, the more they talk it up, the more embarrassing it is that the Ukrainians crossed the river and established a bridgehead. But it's the bridgehead to know where. There are no strategic reserves to reinforce the area even if they can carve a legit operational lodgement, the UAF are nearly entirely committed at this point. And they've already proven they can't break through legit Russian defenses when their supply lines are fully secured and they're massed (Tokmak axis all summer and fall), so as soon as the Russians do reinforce it, they'll hold.\n\nWhich is probably why the Ukrainians are doing this operation now.\n\nWell, in all honesty it could be that Zelensky's administration, who desperately crave victory for their counteroffensive which they declare isn't over, are legitimately trying to reach Crimea by a river crossing. \n\nBut giving them the benefit of the doubt that they're not braindead, this is a more likely a diversion meant to force the Russians to shift forces from somewhere else, as well as a good opportunity to kill Russians and destroy their equipment while the UAF has the tactical advantage for the time being.

The fighting in their part of the front had already reached stalemate conditions after UAF's failure to reach Russia's major fortifications in that area (for what was some speculate, a feint in the first place that was over committed to). This was well before Ukraine gave up pushing in Robotyne. \n\n[This map has accurate geolocations for most of Ukraine's units, present and past](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=180u1IkUjtjpdJWnIC0AxTKSiqK4G6Pez&hl=en_US&ll=47.402393609600104%2C35.850847225019585&z=9).
