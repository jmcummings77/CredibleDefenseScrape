I cannot imagine how the US would go to war with China outside of an invasion of Taiwan, nor have I seen any indication that Washington does, either. The defense of Taiwan provides the political justification for a conventional conflict and also greatly complicates the PLA's operational objectives. If China takes Taiwan before the US can muster a proper response then there's little domestic incentive to continue the conflict. Just look at how contentious the matter of funding and arming Ukraine has been, and that's neither a direct conflict for the US nor has Ukraine been completely taken.

I cannot imagine how the US would go to war with China outside of an invasion of Taiwan, nor have I seen any indication that Washington does, either. The defense of Taiwan provides the political justification for a conventional conflict and also greatly complicates the PLA&#39;s operational objectives. If China takes Taiwan before the US can muster a proper response then there&#39;s little domestic incentive to continue the conflict. Just look at how contentious the matter of funding and arming Ukraine has been, and that&#39;s neither a direct conflict for the US nor has Ukraine been completely taken. Had Russia succeeded in besieging Kyiv and forcing their conditions within the first month of the conflict, the US would have left Ukraine to its fate.</p>\n</div>",

Unlike its predecessors, China is [not ceding ground in manufacturing](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/china-worlds-sole-manufacturing-superpower-line-sketch-rise) as it moves up the value chain, but rather [retaining it](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-factory-floor-is-movingbut-not-to-india-or-mexico-dbd9fd69) in lieu of following the established path of shifting to a more service-based economy. Instead of shrinking, its [share of manufacturing is growing](https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-record-manufacturing-surplus). This creates all sorts of problems, for developing countries [seeking to industrialize themselves](https://rhg.com/research/how-chinas-overcapacity-holds-back-emerging-economies/) but can't because China is making everything, for developed countries [seeking to reindustrialize themselves](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-01-07/china-risks-triggering-new-trade-war-with-xi-jinping-s-latest-economic-plan) but can't because China is making everything, and for China itself whose [people will remain perpetually less wealthy](https://www.ft.com/content/879f5de7-cd9b-4987-9c2b-8b23cf0f3800) then they would otherwise be. Needless to say, I could go on about this for a long time. \n\nIt does, however, have one very large advantage. The overwhelming focus on the production of real, tangible, material assets means that economic output is correspondingly real, tangible, and material. It can be measured, divided, regulated, reallocated, and so on. It retains intrinsic value regardless of whatever people think it should be worth. And unlike paper wealth, it can be repurposed for war. Not coincidentally, a population which consumes far less than it produces is correspondingly far less likely to run out of stuff despite wartime shortages. And of course, as we are seeing in Ukraine right now, war is the ultimate consumer of overcapacity. It's entirely fair to characterize the current trajectory of the Chinese economy as horribly imbalanced, mercantilist, and racing to the bottom (and many economists have). But there are very compelling reasons for it to be so. \n\nCurrency is its own subject, and one which I think is massively overhyped. At the end of the day, it's paper. It's the exact opposite of what the Chinese development plan is currently prioritizing. It can and will be weaponized, it can and will cause considerable economic pain to both China and the world. It probably isn't exaggerating to say the global economy will be so badly damaged it never be the same. It's still ultimately just paper. As demonstrated by Russia, there are ways around it, inefficient and inconvenient though they might be. If you care to dig, there is also considerable evidence of PBOC swap lines and hidden transfers and mBridge and all the other sanction-proofing measures underway. Not to replace the USD outright, just to deny its ability to dictate Chinese commercial activity. That being said, I regard all of that as incidental to the bigger picture. \n\nIn the event of war, the USD will undoubtedly cause untold financial destruction. But China is gearing up to cause untold physical destruction, and I have to say, I favor the odds of that strategy prevailing. \n\n> Glancing through it, I don't really see it painting a definitive picture. \n\nI thought this line halfway through was particularly bleak. \n\n> In sum, qualitative and quantitative indicators tell the same story: Since\n1600, international politics has seen no comprehensive cases of national renewal after a period of striking relative decline. We turned to a related\nconcept, the idea of anticipatory renewal, as an alternative focus.\n\nIt's rather telling when your investigation turns up zero examples of what you set out to find, and you need to hastily amend your thesis so you still have something to publish. \n\n> In short, everything is changing and we should all strap in for a wild ride. We're looking at unprecedented shifts that have no answer from the past 300 years.\n\nI agree with this conclusion. From what I can tell, the highest levels of Chinese leadership also agrees (Xi: Changes unseen in a hundred years), and is preparing like the world's biggest doomsday prepper.

This creates all sorts of problems, for developing countries <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/how-chinas-overcapacity-holds-back-emerging-economies/\">seeking to industrialize themselves</a> but can&#39;t because China is making everything, for developed countries <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-01-07/china-risks-triggering-new-trade-war-with-xi-jinping-s-latest-economic-plan\">seeking to reindustrialize themselves</a> but can&#39;t because China is making everything, and for China itself whose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/879f5de7-cd9b-4987-9c2b-8b23cf0f3800\">people will remain perpetually less wealthy</a> then they would otherwise be. Needless to say, I could go on about this for a long time. </p>\n\n<p>It does, however, have one very large advantage. The overwhelming focus on the production of real, tangible, material assets means that economic output is correspondingly real, tangible, and material. It can be measured, divided, regulated, reallocated, and so on. It retains intrinsic value regardless of whatever people think it should be worth. And unlike paper wealth, it can be repurposed for war. Not coincidentally, a population which consumes far less than it produces is correspondingly far less likely to run out of stuff despite wartime shortages. And of course, as we are seeing in Ukraine right now, war is the ultimate consumer of overcapacity. It&#39;s entirely fair to characterize the current trajectory of the Chinese economy as horribly imbalanced, mercantilist, and racing to the bottom (and many economists have). But there are very compelling reasons for it to be so. </p>\n\n<p>Currency is its own subject, and one which I think is massively overhyped. At the end of the day, it&#39;s paper. It&#39;s the exact opposite of what the Chinese development plan is currently prioritizing. It can and will be weaponized, it can and will cause considerable economic pain to both China and the world. It probably isn&#39;t exaggerating to say the global economy will be so badly damaged it never be the same. It&#39;s still ultimately just paper. As demonstrated by Russia, there are ways around it, inefficient and inconvenient though they might be. If you care to dig, there is also considerable evidence of PBOC swap lines and hidden transfers and mBridge and all the other sanction-proofing measures underway. Not to replace the USD outright, just to deny its ability to dictate Chinese commercial activity. That being said, I regard all of that as incidental to the bigger picture. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of war, the USD will undoubtedly cause untold financial destruction. But China is gearing up to cause untold physical destruction, and I have to say, I favor the odds of that strategy prevailing. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Glancing through it, I don&#39;t really see it painting a definitive picture. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I thought this line halfway through was particularly bleak. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In sum, qualitative and quantitative indicators tell the same story: Since\n1600, international politics has seen no comprehensive cases of national renewal after a period of striking relative decline. We turned to a related\nconcept, the idea of anticipatory renewal, as an alternative focus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s rather telling when your investigation turns up zero examples of what you set out to find, and you need to hastily amend your thesis so you still have something to publish. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short, everything is changing and we should all strap in for a wild ride. We&#39;re looking at unprecedented shifts that have no answer from the past 300 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree with this conclusion. From what I can tell, the highest levels of Chinese leadership also agrees (Xi: Changes unseen in a hundred years), and is preparing like the world&#39;s biggest doomsday prepper. And those guys don&#39;t stock up on dollar bills.</p>\n</div>",

A setup which creates a tremendous amount of tension internationally as well as domestically, and really doesn't help an already-tense environment.\n\nI actually don't think it's as much Beijing's explicit strategy as it is Beijing having to work within the economic realities of both post-2008 global trade and their own domestic economic and political situation. The post-2008 infrastructure and real-estate binge in China was necessary to keep the Chinese growth engine afloat after foreign demand fell off a cliff due to the financial crisis. This binge also helped buoy global economic \"recovery\" while the US engaged in multiple rounds of QE to inject liquidity into the global economy. However, what it left us with was an immense private Chinese debt growth in a short span of time and a US monetary regime of continual expansion with near-zero interest rates.\n\nThe US is also a victim of economic circumstance alongside Beijing. I personally consider the USD reserve status to be something like a financial drug addiction. Check out the **A financial Dutch disease** section of [this article](https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-class-politics-of-the-dollar-system/) for an overview of the idea. [This article on the history of the international gold standard](https://tontinecoffeehouse.com/2023/06/05/the-gold-standard-between-the-wars-part-i/) is also a great prelude to the subject. Michael Pettis (I see you linked one of his articles) has also provided a lot of fascinating writing on this subject.\n\nRemember when I mentioned a \"beast\" earlier? I really meant that. The global economy has become a beast unto itself over the course of the past ~200 years and we're all just along for the ride, even Beijing and Washington.\n\n>I don't think war is a solution consciously sought after; I think the fear of that black swan is what drove them to make the systemic choices they did. And the result could very easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy because the cost of waging a war might perversely be \"lower\" (relatively speaking, in the sense of losing less from war) than the cost of not waging it.\n\nI was more speaking to your proposal of war being a possible solution to China's consumption deficit. It's not that war is technically a consumption sink (albeit not in the same sense as peacetime consumption), but US-China war would basically redefine the global economy and both US and China's respective economies. It's like suggesting that a hurricane could be the solution to a city's zoning issues.\n\nI definitely agree with you that it's not consciously sought after by the Chinese government. However, I don't think it's a fear of a black swan event that is driving the decision-making. As I alluded to earlier in this post, I think it's driven primarily by the contours of the global and Chinese economies, combined with the one-party, democratic centralist nature of a Marxist-Leninist state. Micheal Pettis has written quite a bit about the idea that domestic political considerations limit the degree to which the CCP can abdicate economic power (and thus purchasing power and domestic consumption) to non-CCP Chinese entities.\n\nI believe the crackdown on Chinese tech in ~2018-2019 was a confirmation of this idea; one could also view the crackdown on \"shadow financing\" in the later 2010s as another confirmation, although there was also a legitimate concern of financial instability and speculation getting too out of hand. IMO, that \"shadow financing\" and the general dominance of Chinese real estate investment in aggregate Chinese savings are signs of insufficient investment opportunities for the Chinese population, but that's an entirely different topic for which I lack the experience and financial acumen to do justice.\n\n>I think is is optimistic to imagine a war on the proposed scale will not affect the entire planet.\n\nI certainly believe it will affect the entire planet, if only by virtue of the global economic interconnectedness. Regarding my comment on US manufacturing, the caveat here is that the US is the largest consumer market on the planet, by a significant margin. US consumption does not necessarily care where stuff is produced; it could be in the US, Mexico, South America, EU, etc. however, the source of production necessarily determines the cost, which drives inflation.\n\nI am not suggesting this as a silver bullet. I'm fully aware of all the complications and downsides involved, particularly with the aforementioned inflation. I'm only bringing this up to give you an idea of the parameters that I'm considering. And this is speculation of suboptimal situations; I'm not trying to present some kind of geopolitical \"gotcha\" to claim that the US can just do its own thing unscathed.\n\n>But US manufacturing will never be globally competitive so long as the USD maintains its status as the reserve currency.\n\nWell, it's competitive enough to hold second spot but I get what you're saying and I agree. In addition to the reserve currency status the cost of labor in the US is also a major headwind, followed by municipal zoning and environmental protections. There's also the low unemployment rate in the US. Where will the industrial workers come from? China has been urbanizing for a while but it still has a sizeable rural population; mechanizing agricultural labor (and possibly consolidating it into industrial agriculture) frees up labor to be absorbed by industrial and service sectors. Suffice to say, the US hasn't had that surplus labor capacity in over a century.\n\n>For the exact same reasons Chinese manufacturing is so competitive and their consumers so poor, just flipped. Can't have your cake and eat it too.\n\nEhh, cost of labor and open-market operations by the BoC help keep Chinese manufacturing cost competitive, but there's also a significant factor of economic agglomeration and talent concentration. Regarding the former, the colocation of so much of the supply chain within the same country (even within the Pearl River Delta for a lot of electronics manufacturing) provides a logistical advantage. Regarding the latter, economic agglomeration and economies of scale lead to a domestic concentration of engineering talent that enables these industries. For instance, materials engineers and industrial engineers. Not even degreed workers, but also steelworkers, shipwrights, etc. All of that manufacturing provides an inertia of its own that incentivizes domestic talent formation. Credit where credit is due, the Chinese people have accomplished an immense amount.\n\nIn addition to all of this, there are the political pressures to maintain domestic employment as well as the profits of SOEs.\n\n>Right, but they have plenty of real stuff to spend it on. Too much, in fact, hence the deflation.\n\nI was responding to your comment about having \"bullets than money\" but I think we were speaking past one another on this. The US and China both \"have money\". What the US has is a greater services:industry labor ratio than the US. I think both our points are irrelevant and misplaced. A lot of Chinese M2 is probably tied up in real estate and other sectors because China has a different mechanism for handling monetary policy. The Chinese government effectively controls Chinese banking, so it has different avenues through which to implement monetary policy. [This is an article on Chinese monetary policy](https://jipengliu.com/post/china-m2/) that I just dug up with some Googling, but I know I've found much better ones in the past. I've tried a variety of search terms to find the research paper that I saw in the past, but I can't find it :(\n\nSetting aside M2, the US doesn't have \"money\".

A setup which creates a tremendous amount of tension internationally as well as domestically, and really doesn&#39;t help an already-tense environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s as much Beijing&#39;s explicit strategy as it is Beijing having to work within the economic realities of both post-2008 global trade and their own domestic economic and political situation. The post-2008 infrastructure and real-estate binge in China was necessary to keep the Chinese growth engine afloat after foreign demand fell off a cliff due to the financial crisis. This binge also helped buoy global economic &quot;recovery&quot; while the US engaged in multiple rounds of QE to inject liquidity into the global economy. However, what it left us with was an immense private Chinese debt growth in a short span of time and a US monetary regime of continual expansion with near-zero interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>The US is also a victim of economic circumstance alongside Beijing. I personally consider the USD reserve status to be something like a financial drug addiction. Check out the <strong>A financial Dutch disease</strong> section of <a href=\"https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-class-politics-of-the-dollar-system/\">this article</a> for an overview of the idea. <a href=\"https://tontinecoffeehouse.com/2023/06/05/the-gold-standard-between-the-wars-part-i/\">This article on the history of the international gold standard</a> is also a great prelude to the subject. Michael Pettis (I see you linked one of his articles) has also provided a lot of fascinating writing on this subject.</p>\n\n<p>Remember when I mentioned a &quot;beast&quot; earlier? I really meant that. The global economy has become a beast unto itself over the course of the past ~200 years and we&#39;re all just along for the ride, even Beijing and Washington.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t think war is a solution consciously sought after; I think the fear of that black swan is what drove them to make the systemic choices they did. And the result could very easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy because the cost of waging a war might perversely be &quot;lower&quot; (relatively speaking, in the sense of losing less from war) than the cost of not waging it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was more speaking to your proposal of war being a possible solution to China&#39;s consumption deficit. It&#39;s not that war is technically a consumption sink (albeit not in the same sense as peacetime consumption), but US-China war would basically redefine the global economy and both US and China&#39;s respective economies. It&#39;s like suggesting that a hurricane could be the solution to a city&#39;s zoning issues.</p>\n\n<p>I definitely agree with you that it&#39;s not consciously sought after by the Chinese government. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fear of a black swan event that is driving the decision-making. As I alluded to earlier in this post, I think it&#39;s driven primarily by the contours of the global and Chinese economies, combined with the one-party, democratic centralist nature of a Marxist-Leninist state. Micheal Pettis has written quite a bit about the idea that domestic political considerations limit the degree to which the CCP can abdicate economic power (and thus purchasing power and domestic consumption) to non-CCP Chinese entities.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the crackdown on Chinese tech in ~2018-2019 was a confirmation of this idea; one could also view the crackdown on &quot;shadow financing&quot; in the later 2010s as another confirmation, although there was also a legitimate concern of financial instability and speculation getting too out of hand. IMO, that &quot;shadow financing&quot; and the general dominance of Chinese real estate investment in aggregate Chinese savings are signs of insufficient investment opportunities for the Chinese population, but that&#39;s an entirely different topic for which I lack the experience and financial acumen to do justice.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think is is optimistic to imagine a war on the proposed scale will not affect the entire planet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I certainly believe it will affect the entire planet, if only by virtue of the global economic interconnectedness. Regarding my comment on US manufacturing, the caveat here is that the US is the largest consumer market on the planet, by a significant margin. US consumption does not necessarily care where stuff is produced; it could be in the US, Mexico, South America, EU, etc. however, the source of production necessarily determines the cost, which drives inflation.</p>\n\n<p>I am not suggesting this as a silver bullet. I&#39;m fully aware of all the complications and downsides involved, particularly with the aforementioned inflation. I&#39;m only bringing this up to give you an idea of the parameters that I&#39;m considering. And this is speculation of suboptimal situations; I&#39;m not trying to present some kind of geopolitical &quot;gotcha&quot; to claim that the US can just do its own thing unscathed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But US manufacturing will never be globally competitive so long as the USD maintains its status as the reserve currency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, it&#39;s competitive enough to hold second spot but I get what you&#39;re saying and I agree. In addition to the reserve currency status the cost of labor in the US is also a major headwind, followed by municipal zoning and environmental protections. There&#39;s also the low unemployment rate in the US. Where will the industrial workers come from? China has been urbanizing for a while but it still has a sizeable rural population; mechanizing agricultural labor (and possibly consolidating it into industrial agriculture) frees up labor to be absorbed by industrial and service sectors. Suffice to say, the US hasn&#39;t had that surplus labor capacity in over a century.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the exact same reasons Chinese manufacturing is so competitive and their consumers so poor, just flipped. Can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ehh, cost of labor and open-market operations by the BoC help keep Chinese manufacturing cost competitive, but there&#39;s also a significant factor of economic agglomeration and talent concentration. Regarding the former, the colocation of so much of the supply chain within the same country (even within the Pearl River Delta for a lot of electronics manufacturing) provides a logistical advantage. Regarding the latter, economic agglomeration and economies of scale lead to a domestic concentration of engineering talent that enables these industries. For instance, materials engineers and industrial engineers. Not even degreed workers, but also steelworkers, shipwrights, etc. All of that manufacturing provides an inertia of its own that incentivizes domestic talent formation. Credit where credit is due, the Chinese people have accomplished an immense amount.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to all of this, there are the political pressures to maintain domestic employment as well as the profits of SOEs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Right, but they have plenty of real stuff to spend it on. Too much, in fact, hence the deflation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was responding to your comment about having &quot;bullets than money&quot; but I think we were speaking past one another on this. The US and China both &quot;have money&quot;. What the US has is a greater services:industry labor ratio than the US. I think both our points are irrelevant and misplaced. A lot of Chinese M2 is probably tied up in real estate and other sectors because China has a different mechanism for handling monetary policy. The Chinese government effectively controls Chinese banking, so it has different avenues through which to implement monetary policy. <a href=\"https://jipengliu.com/post/china-m2/\">This is an article on Chinese monetary policy</a> that I just dug up with some Googling, but I know I&#39;ve found much better ones in the past.

That would make them a particularly vicious enemy. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a mirror of the stugna-p, which was an indication, at least to me, that Ukraine was extremely serious about their own defense. An unmotivated force would not develop their own weapons from scratch, and Taiwan has A LOT of weapons developed from scratch. </p>\n\n<p>Again, indicators, but no hard evidence.</p>\n</div>",

The 3:1 number can be confirmed with the captured Russian maps shown in the Stormbreak report. The map showed down to platoon level positions and one can see that for every Russian company-level line of 4 platoons, they could locate 3 lines of Ukrainian companies with the individual platoons.

Well, the more serious problem is now confirmed:\n\n>The offensive plan envisaged Ukraine fielding 12 brigades. [...] The brigades for the offensive comprised three brigades of the National Guard \r\nof Ukraine (the 3rd, 14th and 15th Brigades) and three tactical groups of the AFU. \r\nThe latter were called corps (the 9th Corps, the 10th Corps and the \u2018Maroon\u2019 Corps), \r\neven though they were definitely not corps, by neither NATO nor Ukrainian \r\nstandards, lacking corps echelon troops or the cohesion to function as formations. \r\n[...] Rather than being full armoured and mechanised brigades, \r\nthe tactical groups consisted of two to three mechanised battalions each, with \r\nadditional unmechanised units. The subordinate brigades fielded few critical \r\nenablers. The original scheme of manoeuvre had been for 9th Corps to be \r\nresponsible for the initial break-in through the Russian disruption belt, for 10th\r\nCorps to penetrate to Tokmak, and for the Maroon Corps to then exploit towards \r\nMelitopol.\n\nSo turned out, a \"Corp\" that should be consisted of multiple brigades instead had multiple brigades having a battalion each. So much for the fanfare of \"NATO trained brigades\" and in the process, they raised a third to half of authorised strength. On the defending side was 6 regiments. 12 brigades vs. 6 regiments would be OK COF, but in reality, it was more like 4-6 vs. 6. Unless the skill differentials were that of the Germans vs. The Soviets in June 1941, this COF will not work. The three National Guards brigades were not examined for actual troop strengths but it's notable that the 3rd Brigade was previously the Azov battalion, which was renamed a regiment then 3rd Assault and now the 12th brigade. Is it likely that Azov could instantly expand their ranks 3 times after they were surrounded in Mariupol? It's not that Ukrainian brigades couldn't scale their offensives beyond companies, companies were all they had.\n\n\"Nearly all failures can be traced back to the lack of mass at the LD\".

        "body": "*I'm going to try something new, not debate, and just post my thoughts on a given subject. Enjoy...*\n\nMy Thoughts on Krynky\n\nPart 1\n\nI think the UAF cross Dnieper operation, be it at Krynky or somewhere else, was originally planning as a cross river operation to be included with their spring counteroffensive but it was cancelled when the Kakhovka Dam was destroyed (I won't get into how I think that happened, as that really doesn't matter, but immediately after June 6 it wasn't really possibly).\n\nAs originally designed, I doubt the river crossing operation would have been big, especially since most of the UAF Marine brigades that would later be used in Krynky were attacking in the Velyka Novosilka sector as part of the supporting effort in the 2023 counteroffensive. \u00a0\n\nHere's what I think happened.\n\nBy late summer it was obvious that the Orikhiv push, Tokmak to Melitipol, the main effort of the counteroffensive, was not going to work unless the UAF got more forces and priority logistics, so Zelensky authorized the Velyka Novo. attacks to halt, which ends around Sept 1-ish. It wasn't going anywhere, and was consuming manpower, equipment, and supplies at a heavy rate that could be used elsewhere.\n\nLtGen Sodol was both commanding the UA Marine Corps but also the UAF operational grouping of forces Donetsk commander, he was running the Velyka Novosilka operation, but then his HQ is freed up along with his three marine brigades. They could use those forces elsewhere in UA. Where? Why not try the cross Dnieper operation again?\n\nWhat else is happening in September-October in Ukraine?\n\nUkraine was still on the attack in Orikhiv and Bakhmut. Russia was counter attacking a bit in Kupyansk but it's big Avdiivka push didn't start until mid October, about the same time the initial incursions across the Dnieper started, which means the UA plan was in effect already.\n\nA cross Dnieper operation wasn't really that terrible of a plan, at least in theory, as long as it was done for the correct reasons and at limited scale. In fact, I'd even argue it has the potential to be a brilliant way to conduct an active defense, which is what the Ukrainians should have gone to since summer 2023, in between offensives.\n\nA lot of the flooded water caused by the dam's collapse had dried up or receded during the summer. The Russians were heavily committed elsewhere defending Tokmak especially. UAF SOF were already probing the area, reporting back that it was barely defended, which was likely confirmed by drones, NATO satellite IMINT, HUMINT, etc. There was barely anything defending the river edge, so the Russians would need to rush reserves there, competent ones too of they get nothing done. Plus they'd need to be prioritized with logistics too. The more priority they put on Kherson Oblast, the more it would pull off the Russians elsewhere, especially where the UAF wanted to make gains at that point, Tokmak at a minimum and liberating Bakhmut was important for Zelensky.\n\nPlus, they have the freed up veteran Marine/TDF units who have some amphibious training, along with an existing pipeline for replacement troops.\n\nI'm pretty sure the UAF General Staff planned it as some grand attrition battle. They'd only need to commit minimal number of Marines to bite and hold the eastern bank, not even a full battalion's worth at a time, which would trigger major Russian counterattacks. Holding the higher western bank, with the Russians forced to use a very limited number of avenues of approach through overwatched routes by lots of the top tier drone strike and artillery units supporting, the UAF had the possibility of achieving an extremely costly butchers bill on the Russians.\n\nAnd that especially coincides with UA strategic policy (win the war by attrition) and their operational mindset, electing to fight attritional battles where they go into them thinking they'll cause massive losses to the Russians (though often times it backfired, like Severondonetsk-Lyschansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, etc).\n\nElite drone units like Magyar's Birds were committed to the cross Dnieper operation, who according to Mike Kofman are unbelievably good with drones and at regimental size at this point. I've got no evidence to back it up, but I think the UAF strike drone contingent might have been THE reason the cross river operation was authorized at all, they were probably the main effort. Their mission: take advantage of the Russian counterattack to the UAF Marine crossing and enact the most lopsided exchange ratio possible. Operation Tethered Goat, with the strike drone units in particular being the hunter in the hide site with rifle waiting to shoot the tiger as it approaches the goat.\n\nAll the talk of going further, using it as a jump off point to take the rest of Kherson and Crimea, I never took that seriously and giving the benefit of the doubt to the UA leadership, I think the overt talk was part of a deception plan. After all, bait only works if the prey wants to eat it. Politically, it would be difficult for Putin to ignore the crossing without an aggressive effort to stop it and retake the river edge. But militarily, a UAF foothold across the Dnieper is even more dangerous as it can expand to a lodgement and then subsequent threat increases to Crimea.\n\nI bet the PowerPoint slides and accompanying presentation for OP Tethered Goat led to applause even. Overall, it's not even that wild of an idea. Gaining a foothold over the Dnieper means extending the strategic frontage by attacking a weak enemy location, that's a very sensible approach to the economy of force. Done right. \u00a0\n\nDone badly it can be very costly and stupid.\n\nContinued in Part 2",

            "body": "Part 2\n\nHere's where OP Tethered Goat gets grounded in reality.\n\n- Sodol was in charge. That dude is a butcher, cut from the cloth of the obvious Soviet heritage of the UAF, he doesn't give two shits about friendly losses, soldiers aren't humans to him, they're just pawns, assets to be used no different than ammo or fuel. He was apparently a butcher of his own troops in every battle he fought in this war previously, most notably at Velyka Novosilka, where there were numerous complaints of units forced to repeatedly attack despite knowing the attacks would fail, then doing it again and again, with no sense.\n\nAn operation like at Krynky would always be costly, it's just too hard to support logically, casualty evacuation would be difficult or impossible, it was going to be rough on the UA Marines however well they performed. But Sodol was the very last person that should have been in charge, having him in charge was bad news for the UAF Marines, it meant they would be treated as Meat for the grinder, which is exactly how it played out.\n\n- The Battle of Krynky started as the UAF mobilization crisis was starting to gather significant traction in the Pro-UA media, domestic and global. As the mobilization crisis got worse, winter of 2023-24, and as the overall strategic situation deteriorated especially in late winter-spring 2024, the Krynky operation got noticeably bloodier for the Ukrainians.\n\nIt didn't matter that the Ukrainians were winning the attritional battle against the Russians when it became grossly apparent by way of reporting from the UAF Marines that the way they were doing it was just shy of a suicide mission for the poor Ukrainian bastards sent to the far side. The Russians couldn't have come up with a better propaganda campaign to make the UAF manpower crisis worse than by doing what the Ukrainians did.\n\n- It only works if the Russians take the bait and keep charging. If they hold back and use their own recon fires complex against the UAF Marines and the fire support/logistics on the western bank, the UAF takes more losses than planned. And that seems to have been the case since early 2024 when even Putin was joking on TV that he was going to take advantage of the UAF Marines being easy targets for fires (or something like that).\n\n\n- Like TOO MANY other operations that went south, and likely for equally stupid reasons, Zelensky et al refused to shut down the operation when it should have been. They seemed to minimize it over the late spring and into the summer, pulling most of the beachhead out and leaving only a token force that had enough supporting fires from the west bank to keep them alive, but they waited until summer 2024 to finally end the operation that should have ended no later than Dec 2023.\n\nWhy end it at all?\n\nI think it's because the UAF General Staff really needed those units elsewhere. Sure, over the previous 10 months those extra 3-4 Marine brigades and all their supporting units would have been more useful elsewhere than Krynsky. But the cupboard is pretty bare right now, they really do need those freed up combat units elsewhere.\n\nMy guess was the loss of the supporting enablers that were so critical in the Krynky operation was what caused it to get shut down. Specifically the strike drone units like Magyar's Birds, they were needed to reinforce Kharkiv (where Michael Kofman confirmed their location). But without those strike enablers, nothing about Krynky works anymore, they were outright critical to cause the attrition against the Russians making their way to the eastern bank to try to drive off the UAF Marines.\n\nUltimately, my opinion is that the UA govt and general staff were focused too much on numbers and not on people. This is not the first time that's happened either. It can now be seen again, just like past battles they became too enamored with kill ratios, they are reporting on Krynky hyping a lopsided exchange rate, because that's what drives their operational mindset, drives their strategy, and is used as a political weapon to drum up western support and try to exhaust Russian willpower.\n\nBut whose willpower was really hurt worse?\n\nBack in the day, military commanders would commonly ask for volunteers when desiring a combat force to perform a mission defined by misery and high casualties, and then throw medals and glory at those who survived. That's how Krynky should have gone down. Krynky was an operation MADE for disposable troops that were volunteers, be they convicts wanting a pardon, nationalist ideologues willing to die for their cause, desperate men chasing monetary rewards or glory. \n\nBut using regular troops, especially mobiks serving involuntarily, was a mistake regardless of the body count win against the Russians, that was a psychological defeat for the Ukrainians as much as a military one. Krynky was a PR disaster for the Ukrainians, one they refused to address, which definitely made the UA military leadership look more callous, ruthless, uncaring, at the exact same time they were trying to motivate more Ukrainians to serve in the military, especially in the infantry.",

With Russia firing 30.000-50.000 rounds a day, it means that **Russia is losing 10-16 barrels a day** without any enemy interference, likely far more when reflecting the low quality of North Korean shells. \n> \n> With **Russia only being able to produce 100-200 barrels per year** (!), it is nowhere near to balance this out. It means that we already know that the critical path of the artillery segment is only what Russia has inherited from the Soviet Union and those supplies are burning down fast. Depending on the analyst the end will be reached in 2-3 years. Then Russians have to either decrease the amount of fired shells (probably far earlier), or find other means to replace their gap. \n\n\nCan anyone confirm that Russia is only able to produce 100-200 artillery barrels per year?

With Russia firing 30.000-50.000 rounds a day, it means that <strong>Russia is losing 10-16 barrels a day</strong> without any enemy interference, likely far more when reflecting the low quality of North Korean shells. </p>\n\n<p>With <strong>Russia only being able to produce 100-200 barrels per year</strong> (!), it is nowhere near to balance this out. It means that we already know that the critical path of the artillery segment is only what Russia has inherited from the Soviet Union and those supplies are burning down fast. Depending on the analyst the end will be reached in 2-3 years. Then Russians have to either decrease the amount of fired shells (probably far earlier), or find other means to replace their gap. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can anyone confirm that Russia is only able to produce 100-200 artillery barrels per year?  That can&#39;t be right, can it?</p>\n</div>",

Netanyahu\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on that question, while the Israeli defense ministry declined to comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Knesset also voted today with a <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-810774\">strong majority</a> against a Palestinian state as popular opinion in Israel remains against that step until hostages are returned and the current conflict is brought to an end</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Knesset issued a declaration opposing Palestinian statehood in advance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s highly publicized trip to Washington next week.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe will not succeed in convincing our friends in the world if we do not speak clearly against the establishment of a Palestinian state, which is a threat to the State of Israel,\u201d New Hope - United Right Party head MK Gideon Sa\u2019ar told the plenum on Wednesday after the 68-9 vote on the text.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe need to go back to talking about [former prime minister] Menachem Begin\u2019s idea of [Palestinian] autonomy,\u201d said Sa\u2019ar whose party is in the opposition.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cForeign sovereignty to the west of the Jordan River, cannot exist,\u201d Sa\u2019ar said as he warned against any Israeli withdrawal from that territory.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEvery area we withdrew from becomes a terror zone,\u201d he stressed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The two declarations have no practical implications, but they provide a roadmap with regard to the political will of Israeli politicians, who would in the future, have to vote on the issue. </p>\n\n<p>Of particular note, was the position taken on Wednesday by National Unity Party head Benny Gantz, who voted to oppose Palestinian statehood, along with three parliamentarians from his party, Michael Biton, Pnina Tameno-Shete, and Chili Tropper.</p>\n\n<p>Gantz has been consistently polling higher than Netanyahu and is considered at this point to be his leading political rival in the next elections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Russia's firepower advantage results in more Ukrainian casualties when the front lines are static. \n\n6. 5% of the time (possibly less) is spent on offensive actions (mainly by the Russians but the Ukrainians counterattack occasionally). Remaining entrenched results in fewer Ukrainian casualties when the Russians go on the offensive. \n\n7. Long-range fighting results in fewer casualties per hour than offensive operations.
