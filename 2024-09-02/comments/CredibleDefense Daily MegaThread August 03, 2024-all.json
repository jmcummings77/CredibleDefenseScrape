        "body": "An article from Naval News that gives a good breakdown of the capabilities of the best USN air wing and how the USN wants to grow those capabilities into the 2030s.  With any Pacific conflict featuring large distances the range of missiles and EW measures and all the platforms you launch them from needs to keep increasing.  It's always fun to wonder what the actual distances/ranges are in a real conflict situation.  \n\n[America\u2019s \u2018Air Wing Of The Future\u2019 Takes Shape In The Pacific | Naval News | August 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/08/americas-air-wing-of-the-future-takes-shape-in-the-pacific/)\n\n*The USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70), based out of San Diego, California, operates with the U.S. Navy\u2019s most advanced air wing, CVW-2, operating the F-35C Lightning II, F/A-18E/F Block III Super Hornet, E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, EA-18G Growler, and MH-60R/S Seahawk. This year, the Carl Vinson deployed with a number of new capabilities, showcasing them for the first time at the bi-annual Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2024 exercise.*\n\n*Naval News was offered an opportunity to embark on the carrier to observe the Air Wing Of The Future (AWOTF) on July 15th, and got an up-close look at day-to-day operations with Rear Admiral Michael S. Wosje, Commander, Carrier Strike Group One, and Captain Matthew C. Thomas, Commanding Officer, USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70).*\n\n*CVW-2 is the first known air wing to field the long-range AIM-174B air-to-air missile, carried by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and adapted from the surface-launched SM-6 Block IA. Naval News recently broke the story of its operational capacity aboard the USS Carl Vinson, and has now learned of its operational presence onboard the carrier during RIMPAC 2024, seen on Super Hornets during launch and recovery operations.*\n\n*The AIM-174B allows CVW-2 to cover a significantly larger area in carrier defense, bringing back the Outer Air Battle concepts of the Cold War that made use of the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix. With a range almost certainly exceeding the traditional SM-6 published range of 130 nmi (240 km), the AIM-174B offers a significant boost in range and kinematic performance over the AIM-120D P3I.4 (86 nmi, 160 km) and even AIM-120D-3, the newest AMRAAM variant that has broken records for the longest air-to-air kill.*\n\n*VAQ-136 \u2018Gauntlets\u2019 operates the EA-18G Growler with a mix of AN/ALQ-99F-V and is set to receive AN/ALQ-249(V)1 electronic warfare (EW) pods as they are delivered to the U.S. Navy. The AN/ALQ-249(V)1 is the mid-band pod of the Next Generation Jammer trio of systems, refreshing the electronic warfare capabilities for EA-18G aircraft through the 2020s and into the 2030s. The new pods have six AESA antennas capable of complex electronic attack, including cyber warfare capabilities that can insert code into remote systems from the air and a power capability ten times that of the legacy ALQ-99F-V.*\n\n*CVW-2 is also likely to receive the AARGM-ER (AGM-88F) as it begins deliveries to the U.S. Navy in FY2024, the latest missile in the series of HARM anti-radiation missiles which brings improved standoff capability to the air wing. The AARGM-ER also features a multi-mode seeker and GPS targeting capability for strikes against surface targets, moving targets, and fixed sites.*\n\n*This is the Carl Vinson\u2018s second deployment with the Air Wing of the Future concept, according to Captain Thomas, who mentioned that the various advanced capabilities are already in the fleet. An example of this capability expanding across the U.S. Navy is the recent deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) with VMFA-314 and their F-35C Lightning IIs. The Abraham Lincoln is the second carrier flying with the Air Wing of the Future concept.*\n\n*The U.S. Navy is pushing hard to deliver Advanced Air Wing capabilities to the entire fleet, and the USS Carl Vinson is the carrier to set an example for years to come as dozens of new capabilities are added. Between non-kinetic capabilities in the F-35\u2019s Tech Refresh 3 (TR-3) and EA-18G AN/ALQ-249 NGJ-MB, and kinetic capabilities like the AGM-88F AARGM-ER and AIM-174B ALC, the Carl Vinson is pushing the envelope in advanced capabilities that are being fielded in the Pacific, completing another keystone of the United States in its pivot to the Indo-Pacific.*",

                "body": "The talk about competitive advantages imo is not appropriate in the modern context between massive market countries, it really only makes sense in the context of raw materials, which are the tiniest fractions of cost, it has next to no bearing on manufacturing. Where manufacturing expands has much more to do with agglomeration, trade policy, and ultimately national priorities than anything else.\n\nWhen people talk about the US converting the industrial base to wartime exigencies they really miss the point, when a war between superpowers breaks out it is really too late. The real catastrophe of US production right now is that we are ill equipped to supply the necessary elements of defense before the war breaks out. When you don't have a significant hand in making something commercially then the government ends up procuring it for stratospheric costs, to the point where it can't be made in useful numbers and most of the knowledge is used in an inefficient \"one-off\" manner. Pretending higher tech items are a solution misses the reality that even high-tech stuff requires manufacturing know how better gained from producing things in large quantities, and the US has certainly lost manufacturing experience there too.\n\nThe real reason manufacturing declined in the US (and it very much did in real terms, if not in velocity of money) is because the political consensus starting in the 1970's was a kind of apathy towards it, and a naive belief in free markets that doesn't stand up to the barest scrutiny.

Where manufacturing expands has much more to do with agglomeration, trade policy, and ultimately national priorities than anything else.</p>\n\n<p>When people talk about the US converting the industrial base to wartime exigencies they really miss the point, when a war between superpowers breaks out it is really too late. The real catastrophe of US production right now is that we are ill equipped to supply the necessary elements of defense before the war breaks out. When you don&#39;t have a significant hand in making something commercially then the government ends up procuring it for stratospheric costs, to the point where it can&#39;t be made in useful numbers and most of the knowledge is used in an inefficient &quot;one-off&quot; manner. Pretending higher tech items are a solution misses the reality that even high-tech stuff requires manufacturing know how better gained from producing things in large quantities, and the US has certainly lost manufacturing experience there too.</p>\n\n<p>The real reason manufacturing declined in the US (and it very much did in real terms, if not in velocity of money) is because the political consensus starting in the 1970&#39;s was a kind of apathy towards it, and a naive belief in free markets that doesn&#39;t stand up to the barest scrutiny.

The estimated number used is 40.\n18 drones managed to reach the target, the rest were destroyed/suppressed by air defense systems.\n\nAs a result of the strike:  \n\u2022 A Su-34 fighter was destroyed;  \n\u2022 A warehouse with aircraft weapons was destroyed;  \n\u2022 A strike was carried out on a flight control point;  \n\u2022 The airfield's engineering equipment was slightly damaged.\n\nAlso, in the context of the attack on the Morozovsk airfield, it is worth emphasizing the following - the previous significant drone attack was carried out in early April 2024. Then more than 50 drones were sent to Morozovsk. None of them managed to reach the target, due to the deployment of modern electronic warfare equipment along the perimeter of the airfield. The drones fell on the approach to the airfield, and the damage that was caused that day - two drones fell on the runway.\nApparently, the Armed Forces of Ukraine re-equipped their drones, making them more resistant to the effects of electronic warfare systems.\u00bb\n\n\nThe big news here is that Ukraine managed to bypass Russia's EW systems. This could have strategic implications. Reportedly, last month Ukraine fired [more long-range drones](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/08/01/ukraine-launched-more-long-range-attack-drones-than-russia-in-july/) than Russia. Without appropriate defenses, the damage will be huge.\n\n\nInterestingly, and also dangerously, there were [nuclear warheads](https://x.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1819744083847295094) on that airbase, but they weren't damaged.

The estimated number used is 40.\n18 drones managed to reach the target, the rest were destroyed/suppressed by air defense systems.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the strike:<br/>\n\u2022 A Su-34 fighter was destroyed;<br/>\n\u2022 A warehouse with aircraft weapons was destroyed;<br/>\n\u2022 A strike was carried out on a flight control point;<br/>\n\u2022 The airfield&#39;s engineering equipment was slightly damaged.</p>\n\n<p>Also, in the context of the attack on the Morozovsk airfield, it is worth emphasizing the following - the previous significant drone attack was carried out in early April 2024. Then more than 50 drones were sent to Morozovsk. None of them managed to reach the target, due to the deployment of modern electronic warfare equipment along the perimeter of the airfield. The drones fell on the approach to the airfield, and the damage that was caused that day - two drones fell on the runway.\nApparently, the Armed Forces of Ukraine re-equipped their drones, making them more resistant to the effects of electronic warfare systems.\u00bb</p>\n\n<p>The big news here is that Ukraine managed to bypass Russia&#39;s EW systems. This could have strategic implications. Reportedly, last month Ukraine fired <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/08/01/ukraine-launched-more-long-range-attack-drones-than-russia-in-july/\">more long-range drones</a> than Russia. Without appropriate defenses, the damage will be huge.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, and also dangerously, there were <a href=\"https://x.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1819744083847295094\">nuclear warheads</a> on that airbase, but they weren&#39;t damaged. Still, people like Sullivan probably won&#39;t like this.</p>\n</div>",

There are people who have grown up under democratic Taiwan all their lives and still identify as Chinese. Less, sure, but it's an issue\n\nAround 2017 I remember a poll going around about what Taiwanese would like to happen; completely deadlocked of course but I remember it saying that 5-8% of Taiwanese would back \\*immediate\\* reunification. Isn't that nuts?

If we're looking at an international legal consideration of a \"blockade\", then I don't see how China's operation could be considered a blockade because they would just be positioning naval forces around their own territory. Within this context, the US has already met the preconditions for war. China would be \"allowed\" to shoot down existing flights, but they do not. Flying supplies through a *de facto* blockade would just be a continuance of this behavior, and thus the prerogative for initiating open conflict would still lie with China. In short, if China is already \"allowed\" to shoot down US flights through Taiwanese airspace, and they were to exercise this right today, would the US just shrug and let it happen? If not, why would this change in a blockade situation?\n\nQuite frankly, I don't really care to split hairs over the legal specifics unless we can get an actual legal expert involved in the discussion. If it came down to a blockade situation without a wider conflict, the conditions have effectively been met for a US-China war. It just becomes a matter of who wants to fire the first shots. We're not talking about a situation in which the US and China are participating in a clear joint governance agreement a la the Allied Control Council, in an immediate post-war situation of joint occupation of a defeated nation. Taiwan was a *de jure* recognized country up until 45 years ago and the entire world has been freely conducting trade and *de facto* diplomatic relations with Taiwan independent of the PRC government for longer than that.",
