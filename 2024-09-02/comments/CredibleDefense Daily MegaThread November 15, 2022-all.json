Funny enough, that was the only shot that hit someone where he didn't aim at the head.\n\nOf the rest:\n\n- One got hit in the frontal lobe of the brain and was essentially lobotomized.\n\n- Another got Joker'd, through and through both cheeks, missing his teeth but left with a really cool scar\n\n- Another got a radio headset ear piece and about 2/3 of his ear shot off, and permanently deaf in that ear \n\n- Another had his chin strap severed by a bullet\n\n- Another had the rear chinstrap screw in the back of the helmet deflect the bullet\n\nDelta Force caught him a year later, but he had previously been hunted unsuccessfully by them, Ranger Recon Company, SEAL, SAS, CIA SAD, and my whole battalion.

Imagine you are the United States, and at this point have built up a stored knowledge of the bases Russians uses for these kinds of attacks, and the weapons used during them. U.S. intelligence is wildly overrated in this conflict on certain parts of reddit, but this is the one area where it is actually really good and has the tools and capabilities to make this kind of thing easy. The U.S. has even alerted Ukrainian pilots to incoming strikes before they hit the exact spots their planes were in early in the war (saving Ukraine's Migs and keeping their airforce afloat). \n\nAnyway, imagine you are the U.S., you know that Russia incessantly launches cruise missiles from these slow moving planes, you know the bases they come from, U.S. assets were already assigned to all of this long ago. Finally those assets see the activity, Russia is planning the attack, and you watch this plane slowly... and I mean slowly... fly from some god forsaken base in Russia to a position in the Caspian Sea. It moves at the speed of a global hawk, ~390mph.\n\nDo you know how long does it take for a fully loaded Russian prop plane to fly from a Russian base to a position over the Caspian Sea? I sure as hell don't, but in 2022 it's the equivalent of extreme time dilation in modern warfare. Time just slows down. I'm guessing watching this thing move and waiting for it to fire was interminable. It's probably the secret to living a long life, just live your entire life on that plane.\n\nMy guess is that flight length - in other words the minimum time - is the time of lift off to the time of positioning over the Sea. Ukraine had that time to rustle their operators and make sure their crews were alerted to the inbound before the strike occurred, then an alert to the actual launch, then the length of the cruise missile trip back to Ukraine... which is long. That minimum time is assuming the U.S. literally ignored all the other signs of heightened: political conditions, signals intelligence in the Black Sea, cruise missile delivery, (loading and unloading - including for the Black Sea vessels), fuel loading on the tarmac plane, etc.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ukraine is saying they fired from the Caspian sea. Imagine you are the United States, and at this point have built up a stored knowledge of the bases Russians uses for these kinds of attacks, and the weapons used during them. U.S. intelligence is wildly overrated in this conflict on certain parts of reddit, but this is the one area where it is actually really good and has the tools and capabilities to make this kind of thing easy. The U.S. has even alerted Ukrainian pilots to incoming strikes before they hit the exact spots their planes were in early in the war (saving Ukraine&#39;s Migs and keeping their airforce afloat). </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, imagine you are the U.S., you know that Russia incessantly launches cruise missiles from these slow moving planes, you know the bases they come from, U.S. assets were already assigned to all of this long ago. Finally those assets see the activity, Russia is planning the attack, and you watch this plane slowly... and I mean slowly... fly from some god forsaken base in Russia to a position in the Caspian Sea. It moves at the speed of a global hawk, ~390mph.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how long does it take for a fully loaded Russian prop plane to fly from a Russian base to a position over the Caspian Sea?

And with Russia\u2019s foreign minister sitting there we highlighted both the illegality and barbaric nature of Russia\u2019s war, and also the devastating impact it\u2019s having on people around the world through higher food and energy prices.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to work with our G20 allies to fix the global economy, to grip inflation, but also to safeguard and preserve the international order, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nMost of the world leaders who spoke at the opening session of the gathering made a direct reference to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, although a number of them are officially neutral on the conflict. The G20 is working on a joint statement which would include a call for peace, although any direct condemnation of the Kremlin could be vetoed by Russia\u2019s representatives.\n\nDuring his own speech to the summit, Mr Sunak paid tribute to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his address, during which he pointedly ignored Russia and made repeated references to the \u201cG19\u201d instead.\n\nThe Prime Minister added: \u201cRussia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine has profound implications for us all, because it has undermined the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. We all depend on these principles. They are the foundations of the international order. They must be upheld.\n\n\u201cIt is very simple \u2013 countries should not invade their neighbours, they should not attack civilian infrastructure and civilian populations and they should not threaten nuclear escalation. Surely these are things on which we can all agree.\u201d\n\nMr Sunak concluded: \u201cOne man has the power to change all of this. It is notable that Putin didn\u2019t feel able to join us here. Maybe if he had, we could get on with sorting things out. Because the single biggest difference that anyone could make is for Russia to get out of Ukraine and end this barbaric war.\u201d\n\nOn the summit\u2019s first day, the Prime Minister held a one-on-one meeting with Muhammad bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, in which he asked for the country to pump more oil in order to bring down the global price of energy.",

        "body": "*For Western Weapons, the Ukraine War Is a Beta Test. Though the battle for Ukraine remains largely a grinding artillery war, new advances in technology and training there are being closely monitored for the ways they are starting to shape combat.*\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/world/europe/ukraine-weapons.html\n\nThree months ago, as Ukrainian troops were struggling to advance against Russian forces in the south, the military\u2019s headquarters in Kyiv quietly deployed a valuable new weapon to the battlefield.\n\nIt was not a rocket launcher, cannon or another kind of heavy arms from Western allies. Instead, it was a real-time information system known as Delta \u2014 an online network that military troops, civilian officials and even vetted bystanders could use to track and share desperately needed details about Russian forces.\n\nThe software, developed in coordination with NATO, had barely been tested in battle.\n\nBut as they moved across the Kherson region in a major counteroffensive, Ukraine\u2019s forces employed Delta, as well as powerful weaponry supplied by the West, to push the Russians out of towns and villages they had occupied for months.\n\nThe big payoff came on Friday with the retreat of Russian forces from Kherson City \u2014 a major prize in the nearly nine-month war.\n\nDelta is one example of how Ukraine has become a testing ground for state-of-the-art weapons and information systems, and new ways to use them, that Western political officials and military commanders predict could shape warfare for generations to come.\n\nThe battle for Ukraine, to be sure, remains largely a grinding war of attrition, with relentless artillery attacks and other World War II-era tactics. Both sides primarily rely on Soviet-era weapons, and Ukraine has reported running low on ammunition for them.\n\nBut even as the traditional warfare is underway, new advances in technology and training in Ukraine are being closely monitored for the ways they are changing the face of the fight. Beyond Delta, they include remote-controlled boats, anti-drone weapons known as SkyWipers and an updated version of an air-defense system built in Germany that the German military itself has yet to use.\n\n\u201cUkraine is the best test ground, as we have the opportunity to test all hypotheses in battle and introduce revolutionary change in military tech and modern warfare,\u201d said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s vice prime minister and minister of digital transformation.\n\nHe was speaking in October at a NATO conference in Norfolk, Va., where he publicly discussed Delta for the first time.\n\nHe also emphasized the growing reliance on the remote-controlled aircraft and boats that officials and military experts said have become weapons of choice like those in no previous war.\n\n\u201cIn the last two weeks, we have been convinced once again the wars of the future will be about maximum drones and minimal humans,\u201d Mr. Federov said.\n\nSince last summer, Ukraine and its allies  have been testing remote-controlled boats packed with explosives in the Black Sea, culminating in a bold attack in October against Russia\u2019s fleet off the coast of Sevastopol.\n\nMilitary officials largely have declined to discuss the attack or provide details about the boats, but both the United States and Germany have supplied Ukraine with similar ships this year. Shaurav Gairola, a naval weapons analyst for Janes, a defense intelligence firm, said the Black Sea strike showed a sophisticated level of planning, given the apparent success of the small and relatively inexpensive boats against Russia\u2019s mightier war ships.\n\nThe attack \u201chas pushed the conflict envelope,\u201d Mr. Gairola said. He said it \u201cimposes a paradigm shift in naval war doctrines and symbolizes an expression of futuristic warfare tactics.\u201d\n\nThe use of remote-controlled boats could become particularly important, military experts said, showing how warfare at sea might play out as the United States and its allies brace for potential future naval aggressions by China in the East and South China Seas, and against Taiwan.\n\nInevitably, the Russians\u2019 increased use of drones has spurred Ukraine\u2019s allies to send new technology to stop them.\n\nLate last year, Ukraine\u2019s military began using the newly developed drone-jamming guns known as SkyWipers to thwart Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The SkyWipers, which can divert or disrupt drones by blocking their communication signals, were developed in Lithuania and had been on the market for only two years before they were given to Ukraine through a NATO security assistance program.\n\nNearly nine months into the war, the SkyWipers are now only one kind of drone jammer being used in Ukraine. But they have been singled out as a highly coveted battlefield asset \u2014 both for Ukrainian troops and enemy forces that hope to capture them.\n\nIt is not known how many SkyWipers have been sent to Ukraine, although Lithuania reportedly sent several dozen in October 2021.

Though the battle for Ukraine remains largely a grinding artillery war, new advances in technology and training there are being closely monitored for the ways they are starting to shape combat.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/world/europe/ukraine-weapons.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/world/europe/ukraine-weapons.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Three months ago, as Ukrainian troops were struggling to advance against Russian forces in the south, the military\u2019s headquarters in Kyiv quietly deployed a valuable new weapon to the battlefield.</p>\n\n<p>It was not a rocket launcher, cannon or another kind of heavy arms from Western allies. Instead, it was a real-time information system known as Delta \u2014 an online network that military troops, civilian officials and even vetted bystanders could use to track and share desperately needed details about Russian forces.</p>\n\n<p>The software, developed in coordination with NATO, had barely been tested in battle.</p>\n\n<p>But as they moved across the Kherson region in a major counteroffensive, Ukraine\u2019s forces employed Delta, as well as powerful weaponry supplied by the West, to push the Russians out of towns and villages they had occupied for months.</p>\n\n<p>The big payoff came on Friday with the retreat of Russian forces from Kherson City \u2014 a major prize in the nearly nine-month war.</p>\n\n<p>Delta is one example of how Ukraine has become a testing ground for state-of-the-art weapons and information systems, and new ways to use them, that Western political officials and military commanders predict could shape warfare for generations to come.</p>\n\n<p>The battle for Ukraine, to be sure, remains largely a grinding war of attrition, with relentless artillery attacks and other World War II-era tactics. Both sides primarily rely on Soviet-era weapons, and Ukraine has reported running low on ammunition for them.</p>\n\n<p>But even as the traditional warfare is underway, new advances in technology and training in Ukraine are being closely monitored for the ways they are changing the face of the fight. Beyond Delta, they include remote-controlled boats, anti-drone weapons known as SkyWipers and an updated version of an air-defense system built in Germany that the German military itself has yet to use.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUkraine is the best test ground, as we have the opportunity to test all hypotheses in battle and introduce revolutionary change in military tech and modern warfare,\u201d said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s vice prime minister and minister of digital transformation.</p>\n\n<p>He was speaking in October at a NATO conference in Norfolk, Va., where he publicly discussed Delta for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>He also emphasized the growing reliance on the remote-controlled aircraft and boats that officials and military experts said have become weapons of choice like those in no previous war.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn the last two weeks, we have been convinced once again the wars of the future will be about maximum drones and minimal humans,\u201d Mr. Federov said.</p>\n\n<p>Since last summer, Ukraine and its allies  have been testing remote-controlled boats packed with explosives in the Black Sea, culminating in a bold attack in October against Russia\u2019s fleet off the coast of Sevastopol.</p>\n\n<p>Military officials largely have declined to discuss the attack or provide details about the boats, but both the United States and Germany have supplied Ukraine with similar ships this year. Shaurav Gairola, a naval weapons analyst for Janes, a defense intelligence firm, said the Black Sea strike showed a sophisticated level of planning, given the apparent success of the small and relatively inexpensive boats against Russia\u2019s mightier war ships.</p>\n\n<p>The attack \u201chas pushed the conflict envelope,\u201d Mr. Gairola said. He said it \u201cimposes a paradigm shift in naval war doctrines and symbolizes an expression of futuristic warfare tactics.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The use of remote-controlled boats could become particularly important, military experts said, showing how warfare at sea might play out as the United States and its allies brace for potential future naval aggressions by China in the East and South China Seas, and against Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>Inevitably, the Russians\u2019 increased use of drones has spurred Ukraine\u2019s allies to send new technology to stop them.</p>\n\n<p>Late last year, Ukraine\u2019s military began using the newly developed drone-jamming guns known as SkyWipers to thwart Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The SkyWipers, which can divert or disrupt drones by blocking their communication signals, were developed in Lithuania and had been on the market for only two years before they were given to Ukraine through a NATO security assistance program.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly nine months into the war, the SkyWipers are now only one kind of drone jammer being used in Ukraine. But they have been singled out as a highly coveted battlefield asset \u2014 both for Ukrainian troops and enemy forces that hope to capture them.</p>\n\n<p>It is not known how many SkyWipers have been sent to Ukraine, although Lithuania reportedly sent several dozen in October 2021. In a statement to The New York Times, Lithuania\u2019s defense ministry said it sent 50 SkyWipers in August after Ukrainian officials called it \u201cone of the top priorities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dalia Grybauskaite, who was Lithuania\u2019s president when the SkyWipers were being designed, said her country\u2019s defense industry made a calculated turn toward producing high-tech equipment during her time in office, from 2009 to 2019, to update a stockpile of weapons that \u201cwere mainly Kalashnikovs\u201d and other Soviet-era arms.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re learning in Ukraine how to fight, and we\u2019re learning how to use our NATO equipment,\u201d Ms. Grybauskaite said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd, yes, it is a teaching battleground.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She paused, then added: \u201cIt is shameful for me because Ukrainians are paying with their lives for these exercises for us.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

Germany\u2019s own military has not yet used the updated version of the systems, which were shipped to Ukraine last month. Additional missiles were delivered last week.\n\nRafael Loss, a weapons expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that by themselves the upgraded air defenses do not \u201crepresent a game-changer.\u201d But he said their use in Ukraine showed how the government in Kyiv had evolved beyond Soviet-era warfare and brought it more in line with NATO.\n\nSenior NATO and Ukrainian officials said the Delta network was a prime example.\n\nMore than an early alert system, Delta combines real-time maps and pictures of enemy assets, down to how many soldiers are on the move and what kinds of weapons they are carrying, officials said.\n\nThat is combined with intelligence \u2014 including from surveillance satellites, drones and other government sources \u2014 to decide where and how Ukrainian troops should attack.\n\nUkraine and Western powers determined they needed the system after Russia instigated a separatist-backed war in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014. It was developed by Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry with NATO assistance and first tested in 2017, in part to wean troops off Russian standards of siloing information among ground units instead of sharing it.\n\nIt has been included in training exercises between Ukraine\u2019s military and other NATO planners in the years since.\n\nInformation sharing has long been a staple for American and other NATO forces. What NATO officials said was surprising about the Delta system was that the network was so broadly accessible to troops that it helped them make battlefield decisions even faster than some more modern militaries. In Kherson, Delta helped Ukrainian troops quickly identify Russian supply lines to attack, Inna Honchar, commander of the nongovernment group Aerorozvidka, which develops drones and other technology for Ukraine\u2019s military, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cBridges were certainly key points,\u201d Ms. Honchar added. \u201cWarehouses and control points were damaged, and the provision of troops became critical\u201d as Russians became increasingly isolated, she said.\n\nDelta\u2019s first real test had come in the weeks immediately after the February invasion as a Russian convoy stretching 40 miles long headed toward Kyiv. Ukrainian drones overhead tracked its advance, and troops assessed the best places to intercept it. Residents texted up-to-the-minute reports to the government with details that could have been seen only up close.\n\nAll the information was collected, analyzed and disseminated through Delta to help Ukraine\u2019s military force a Russian retreat, Ukrainian officials said.\n\n\u201cThat was the very first moment when Delta capabilities were realized at max,\u201d the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said in a statement. It said Delta had since helped identify 1,500 confirmed Russian targets across the country on any given day \u2014 with \u201chundreds of them being eliminated\u201d within 48 hours.\n\nThe test runs in Ukraine are helping senior officials and defense planners in the United States and its allies decide how to invest military spending over the next two decades.\n\nEven routine missions in Ukraine \u2014 like how to get fuel to missile-toting vehicles on the edge of enemy territory \u2014 have set off discussions in American commands over how to design equipment that is not dependent on supply lines.\n\nAnd longer-term strategy about how to coordinate and communicate among allied troops, which officials now say was a challenge during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is being developed as the battle against Russia continues to unfold.\n\nSuch strategic military reforms were being discussed before Ukraine was invaded, said Gen. Philippe Lavigne of France, who leads NATO\u2019s Allied Command Transformation, but \u201cour early observations of this war is that those assumptions are still valid.\u201d\n\nHe said Ukraine had shown how future warfare was likely to be fast-paced and highly contested not just on the ground or in the skies, but also, most important, in cyberspace.\n\n\u201cThis is the future operating environment,\u201d General Lavigne said",

First was Kiev in 3 days, then ok we have a ton of arty and donbass is a smaller area to attack, then ok we&#39;ll cut gas to EU so they&#39;ll give up on ukraine, then ok let&#39;s create an artificial famine and now ok, let&#39;s strike ukrainian infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>These attacks are made to please fascists at home, but also because probably he think these could be a turn for his war.</p>\n\n<p>But he needs to win on the battlefield, not to hope in some 8D chess play every 2 months, imho.</p>\n</div>",

So it made the choice clear for the Vietnamese: give up on some fringe concessions to stop the bombing, or hold out and suffer a worse consequence than what was being asked. Russia, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have combined these strikes with clear signaling on what they want Ukraine to do. What is the ultimate ask here? To surrender? To give up the offensives? The infrastructure strikes dont really put Ukraine in a situation where the damage is worse than the occupation of the contested territories. That is, it doesn't really seem realistic. These strikes would make a lot more sense in the context of ongoing negotiations, where Russia maybe was trying to get Ukraine concede on one diplomatic point. But what they wont do is translate civilian infrastructure damage into battlefield success. What *has* been disproven is the idea that strategic bombing undermines regime popularity in a general sense, that bombing leads to surrender.

The Gauss-Kruger coordinate system is apparently divided into 6-degree zones along meridians from the prime meridian (0), which means that Lviv (Long: ~24 deg) and Kyiv (Long: ~30 deg) would be at the extreme, opposite edges of a zone. Not sure whether that makes mistakes more or less likely, actually. Would need to know more about Russia's equivalent to the US MGRS. \n\nEdit: Actually Kyiv has a long of about 30.5 deg., which places it outside of the zone that the center and east of Lyiv is in. That *should* make such a slip-up in an MGRS-like system not possible, but both cities being on the edges of Gauss-Kruger zones has me curious.\n\nEdit 2: Using only lat/long to investigate - and thus a very crude method - using the alleged coordinates of the strike location - 50.474589, 23.923253 - something does theoretically line up. That coordinate is in the Gauss-Kruger 6deg zone with a Center Meridian (CM) of 21E. The next zone (east half of Lviv's zone) has a CM of 27E; the zone after that (Kyiv's zone) has a CM of 33E. The boundary meridian between the CM 21E and CM 27E zones is 24E; the boundary meridian between the CM27E and CM33E zones is 30E. The incident in Przewodow, Poland was 0.07 deg longitude west of the 24E boundary meridian; at the same latitude, a point 0.07 deg longitude *east* of the 30E meridian is nearly directly on the right-of-way of a high-voltage power line northeast of Mykolaivka, Kyiv Oblast. In MGRS, Przewodow's target would be 34UGA 07 95, while the corresponding spot at power lines near Mykolaivka would be 36UTA 92 95.\nHowever, flipping the coordinate like that is not really how things should work for an MGRS-like system; plus, there's the issue of the small edge grid squares along the boundaries of MGRS zones (which may be different in the Russian system, even if it's MGRS-like). So, this power-line finding is probably a big coincidence.\n\nStill, overall, there's the possibility of the larger geographic coincidences being of use. Something seems odd, though \"seems\" isn't very strong evidence. Regardless, good excuse to refresh on MGRS, I guess.\n\n---\nAlternatively, the Russians are using  lat/long for targeting, for some reason.

The following information is based off my understanding of the underlying concepts of the S-300. \n\nIt is certainly possible.\n\nThe variants of the S-300s that Ukraine uses work off the principle that the launcher launches the missile towards the target using command guidance and when the missile is sufficiently close to the target it either uses semi-active radar homing (SARH) or track-via-missile (TVM) for terminal guidance. \n\nWith SARH, a tracking radar illuminates the target and is received by a radar receiver on the tip of the missile. The missile proceeds to make the appropriate calculations and corrects it course. This is done continuously until the target is neutralized, when the tracking radar cannot illuminate the target, or when the missile cannot intercept the target. After that it should explode.\n\nTVM works off a similar principle. A search radar illuminates the target and the reflected signal is received by the missile. However, the missile instead sends the data of where the target is relative to the missile to the launcher. It then compares the location of the target as seen by the search radar and that relative to the missile. It then calculates the position of the missile overall and sends the trajectory corrections to the missile. In short, it\u2019s basically SARH but the targeting calculations are done by the launcher and not the missile.\n\nTo clarify things, the listed range of the S-300 (depends on variant) is not the absolute range but rather the engagement envelope. It is the range at which the S-300 can reasonably intercept an airborne target. It should be noted that missile *is not* propelled by the rocket for the entirety of the flight.  After that burn phase, the missile will still be guided but every maneuver the missile takes will decrease its speed and maneuverability until it becomes impossible to intercept the target. As an aside, that is actually one of the principles that the SR-71 used to avoid getting intercepted by SAMs. By the time the missile reaches the same altitude as the SR-71, the burn phase has likely already ended. This means that the missile is slow and cannot maneuver well. At that point, the SR-71 is either too far and too fast for the missile or straight up faster than the missile. But I digress.\n\nAt that point, the missile should have blown up automatically. This is to maximize the chance of interception just in case the target is still within the blast radius. As a side effect, it also helps to reduce collateral damage and the chances that whatever remains of the missile is not retrieved by the enemy. However, that obviously did not happen. Whether by poor maintenance or pure malice, the component that governed this action failed. So instead of an explosion, we get nothing. The missile is now a glorified unguided projectile. After all, the missile guidance system thinks that the missile has \u201cblown up\u201d. Who is going to program what happens to the missile after the missile is already gone? Regardless, where the missile lands is now a matter of aerodynamics. And as we already know, that just so happened to be in Poland.\n\nThe S-300 crew likely thought that the missile was operating as usual and simply missed, launching a new missile shortly after. They don\u2019t have much of a way of telling if the missile had exploded or not aside from noticing an additional blip on the search radar among the other blips of Russian missiles or hearing an explosion from inside a vehicle while air raid sirens are going off and the multitude of other explosions.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nEdit: SARH and TVM are used as terminal guidance. Otherwise the missiles would start losing their speed early by correcting their course.",

Moreover, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a will in society to do so, and PiS&#39; hands are tied by popular support as we are approaching an election year.</p>\n</div>",
