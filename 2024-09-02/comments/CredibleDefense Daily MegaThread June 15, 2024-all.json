As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

So there's less incentive to get your phone out. Operations on the front also usually have spotting drones these days, that's where most of the Bradley footage comes from.

The problem is not that it continues, it&#39;s that they eventually got bored themselves. And set fire.</p>\n</div>",

This story is being used by pro CCP actors and I know many people have chosen to forget the beginnings of the pandemic or it seems like it was a century ago but Chinese disinformation and the CCPs desire to suppress the news about the disease in its early stages helped make it possible for it to become a global pandemic in the first place. I don\u2019t think the Chinese ever intended to weaponize the spread but the spread was largely in thanks to their attempts to suppress the news about the disease. That was the first few months but they continued to spread conspiracy theories and misinformation about the disease through the globe. This US campaign was also in response to multiple Chinese campaigns to blame the US for the virus which caused all sorts of disinformation to be spread around the world.

This story is being used by pro CCP actors and I know many people have chosen to forget the beginnings of the pandemic or it seems like it was a century ago but Chinese disinformation and the CCPs desire to suppress the news about the disease in its early stages helped make it possible for it to become a global pandemic in the first place. I don\u2019t think the Chinese ever intended to weaponize the spread but the spread was largely in thanks to their attempts to suppress the news about the disease. That was the first few months but they continued to spread conspiracy theories and misinformation about the disease through the globe. This US campaign was also in response to multiple Chinese campaigns to blame the US for the virus which caused all sorts of disinformation to be spread around the world.

The US House Freedom Caucus was trying to derail the Ukrainian aid bill with riders about protections for the language rights of Transcarpathian Hungarian minorities in Ukrainian schools. And it worked! The House Freedom Caucus scared the Speaker of the House for *months* away from bringing the bill to the floor. This had direct effects on the war. \n\nLook at where the House Reps in the House Freedom Caucus are from. Look at their districts. I joke about flyover country, but they represent some of the most backwoods, rural districts in the US. Where people couldn't find Europe on a map, let alone Transcarpathia. \n\nSo what are the policy effects?

            "body": "Most peoples' perception of misinformation derives from the innate human need to caricature tribal opponents. It's just easier for us mentally for people who disagree to be discounted than to cope with the idea that human beings can have radically different priorities and opinions than ourselves. In the past, the acceptable way to do that was by labeling the outgroup as less than human. In the enlightened present, its to label them as unwitting dupes being fooled by the cunning enemy. All the objective research into this stuff shows mis- and disinformation is a smaller and less impactful part of information diets than is commonly perceived. I don't have time to fully break down the science, but here's a pretty good summary:\n\nhttps://akademie.dw.com/en/disinformation-people-arent-as-gullible-as-we-think/a-67774216\n\n>I don't agree that there has been an increase in information pollution. People think that conspiracy theories and misinformation are on the rise, and that we live in the golden age of misinformation. But the best evidence suggests that conspiracy theories aren't on the rise, that we idealize the past, and that the past wasn't better than the present.\n\n>If anything, exposure to untrustworthy websites decreased between 2016 and 2020 in the US. In some countries, media ecosystems are very likely flooded with misinformation. However, it isn't clear to me that in most Western democracies, media ecosystems are indeed flooded with bad content. For instance, in most countries people mostly turn to trustworthy and established news outlets to learn about the world. And these news outlets often do a pretty decent job.\n\n>Mis- and disinformation are bad for our societies, and it would be better if there was less of it. But there is little evidence that disinformation campaigns like the ones conducted by Russia in the US are very successful. Again, it's an empirical question, but persuasion is difficult. And while it's possible to influence people's beliefs, it's much harder to influence their attitudes or behaviors.\n\n>We should be mindful of influence operations and take them seriously. But we shouldn't assume that they are successful by default and not cover them as such. The goal of many influence operations is to erode trust in democratic institutions. Yet, covering these operations as if they are working, in the sense of having an impact, may do just that \u2014 lead people to lower their support in democracy because they think others have been brainwashed, or that the results of the election aren't legitimate because it has been significantly influenced by foreign actors.\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/04/22/dont-believe-what-theyre-telling-you-about-misinformation\n\n>The evidential gap is all the trickier because little research exists in the first place showing that misinformation affects behavior by changing beliefs. Berinsky acknowledges this in \u201cPolitical Rumors\u201d when he writes that \u201cfew scholars have established a direct causal link\u201d between rumors and real-world outcomes. Does the spread of misinformation influence, say, voting decisions? Van der Linden admits, \u201cContrary to much of the commentary you may find in the popular media, scientists have been extremely skeptical.\u201d\n\n>So it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ve been misinformed about how to fight misinformation. What about the social conditions that make us susceptible?

However let's look at the Russian perspective.\n\nIf your goal is to take Ukraine or otherwise subjugate it, you need to consider what happens if you wait 10 or 20 years. In the case of Ukraine, it was becoming clear that the government that came into power after 2014 was pro-West and started cooperating immediately with the West.\n\nYou give it 10 or 20 years and it would have become more integrated, perhaps even establishing membership in NATO or the EU. Even if not membership, definitely would have received Western support in military matters, intelligence, etc.\n\nSince Russia is not as strong as the West, they needed to act immediately because they would get weaker with every passing year. So, they invaded immediately in 2014 after that government came to power.\n\nWhat about China v Taiwan?\n\nWell, China is only getting stronger with time. Due to their large population and rapid modernization over the last 100 years, they are able to increase their economic weight and slowly dominate their regional area. \n\nThey are also to produce more ships, more tanks, more airplanes, etc than the US simply by the nature of their size. In addition, as the US makes up a smaller and smaller % of military spending as the world becomes less unipolar, they get stronger relative to the US and the US has a progressively harder time projecting power in the South China Sea.\n\nTherefore China only gets better with time. There's no reason to attack now... the best move is simply to wait.\n\nThat's the fundamental difference between Ukraine and Taiwan. I don't think China will invade Taiwan unless aggressive moves are made by the US (For example recognizing Taiwan as an independent country)",
