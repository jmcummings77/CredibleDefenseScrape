Modern US politics uses it quite oddly and pejoratively.\n\nLiberalism is an enlightenment idea concerned with individual rights and consent, and imposing limitations and obligations on those as necessary to create a healthy society. For a few centuries it was the rational opposition to hierarchical/traditionalist systems (monarchism then fascism/authoritarianism) and later to communism as well.

At that point the unit is certified as combat ready. \n\nThe training is different for every unit type, infantry, tank, artillery, even SOF.

That meant as soon as a unit returned to home station it lost most of their enlisted personnel (who returned to civilian life though were part of inactive ready reserve), while limited number of NCOs but pretty much all their officers stayed in the unit. At that point they'd be refilled with enlisted coming from initial training and either do their own trainup or get sent to one run by the US, UK, Canada. \n\nThe justification for restarting might be that the Ukrainians are prioritizing high unit readiness over absolute bare minimum individual training before sending units in combat, or it's being done in conjunction with issuing of western equipment, to ensure units aren't just trained on bare minimum of usage before going into battle. \n\n\n, which is a unit plus because this type of training is a luxury in comparison to focusing on initial training.

The Abrams has a high performance jet engine, where as diesels are brutally simple. Just because the turbine has fewer moving parts doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t need more maintenance. Moreover, working on the Abrams power plant is a specific skill, which most recruits arnt bringing into boot camp. Meanwhile at my high school, the diesel tech track was filled with kids who, let\u2019s say, wouldn\u2019t get into college. Diesel engines are simple and reliable, often even better than your normal gasoline car. It\u2019s just they\u2019re dirty. So very dirty. </p>\n\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t know about the loudness of the Abrams, having never been next to one. This was just anecdotal evidence passed on to me by other smarter people.</p>\n</div>",

But if you got through this summer&#39;s battles without saying &quot;hey, maybe we should start rehabbing those tanks in storage, who <em>knows</em> who we might end up giving them to&quot; why are you a defense minister? </p>\n\n<p>This whole story is mind bogglingly incomprehensible to me. Moreover, just two years ago people were publishing think pieces about Germany becoming the new leader of Europe, Germany taking a leading role, Germany setting itself and Europe apart from the US &amp; Russia. Where is European unity now? The UK beat even the US to the punch, and they dont <em>want</em> to be in Europe. Germany is so slow, as I read this, that they are saying they arn&#39;t capable of even participating in ring swap deals with other countries, let alone supplying heavy weapons to Ukraine. Madness.</p>\n</div>",

Wartime laws also give the authorities sweeping powers to dictate company operations, from what is produced to how much it costs.\n\n>With public calls for tycoons who aren\u2019t enthusiastic enough in their support of the invasion be stripped of their assets, some of Russia\u2019s richest now worry they could see their holdings seized by rivals seen as more loyal or even nationalized, according to people familiar with their thinking. The Kremlin\u2019s public reassurances that business interests will be respected ring hollow with the Russian president\u2019s attention focused on the war, not business, these people said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\n>The growing fears highlight how the invasion, which the Kremlin initially hoped would deliver a lightning victory, has become a campaign without end that\u2019s transforming all aspects of Russian society irreversibly. The lifestyle that came to be known as \u2018dividend aristocrats\u2019 \u2013 tycoons who lived richly in recent years on huge profits from their companies \u2013 is gone forever, top executives said.\n\n>Big business will have to feel the same shock as the war hits home as the rest of the country is, said a person close to the Kremlin, speaking on condition of anonymity. While Putin opposes widespread nationalization as a failed strategy, he said, the time when tycoons could reap the benefits of high commodity prices are over. Wartime, the person added, demands sacrifices from all.\n\n>That attitude has some tycoons fearing that the business outlook is getting much dimmer fast. Some executives have commissioned confidential studies on the experiences of big business in situations they worry are likely to prove analogous: the pre-World War II regimes in Axis countries like Italy, where once-powerful industrial giants were ultimately taken over by the state and subjugated entirely to the war effort. Others draw parallels to the mobilization of German corporate giants under the Nazis.\n\n>The budget deficit is already growing as spending on the war rises and sanctions and other limits squeeze revenues. \u201cThis is to a certain extent a mobilization budget,\u201d Sofya Donets, economist at Renaissance Capital said. Even the current amendments to the plan \u201ccall for a further increase in the tax burden, thought it\u2019s not clear yet when this will happen,\u201d she said.\n\n>Russia's Budget Deficit is Growing as War Spending Mounts. Rising spending for the invasion of Ukraine is adding to fiscal pressures\n\n>So far, the government hasn\u2019t publicly acknowledged using the sweeping powers it gave itself last summer to force business to support the war effort. But tycoons and executives worry they will have little alternative but to comply with any requests for manpower, production or cash.\n\n>The state will take whatever it thinks it needs for the war effort, said a longtime business lobbyist. If in the past, tycoons could work the phones and their contacts in government to protect their interests, those tools now don\u2019t work, he said. \n\n>Among the most vulnerable are those perceived to be insufficiently loyal, according to people familiar with the tycoons\u2019 thinking.\n\n>Legislators have proposed stripping those who have left and criticize the war of their assets and even citizenship. Dmitry Medvedev, the former president who is now a senior Kremlin official known for his angry social-media posts, in December called for designating them \u201cenemies of the state.\u201d\n\n>Putin hasn\u2019t gone that far in public, but he makes no secret that he believes Russians with too much of their wealth abroad are a security risk.\n\n>>\u201cIf a person doesn\u2019t link his life with this country but just takes money out and keeps everything outside, then he values not the country he lives and earns money in but the good relations in the one where he keeps his property and accounts,\u201d Putin told reporters on Dec. 22. \u201cThis kind of person poses a danger to us.\u201d\n\n>Any expropriation will start with those who\u2019ve left Russia, said one tycoon who hasn\u2019t returned to the country since the war started. He cited the examples of Yandex, the tech giant whose founder \u2013 now in Israel \u2013 has sought to negotiate with the Kremlin for an exit that allows him to retain some key businesses, and Oleg Tinkov, who has said he was forced to sell his bank at a deep discount after becoming one of the only wealthy Russians to publicly denounce the war.\n\n>Putin remains opposed to sweeping nationalization, according to people familiar with internal discussions, but that\u2019s little reassurance to tycoons who worry that rivals with better connections to the leadership will be able to take control of their holdings.\n\n>In the fertilizer sector, where surging prices have yielded a bumper crop of profits, Uralchem founder Dmitry Mazepin, the only tycoon to have publicly met Putin one-on-one twice last year, has sought to portray himself as the only big shareholder focusing on the state\u2019s interests, according to several executives at industry rivals. That\u2019s alarmed some others in the sector who\u2019ve stayed out of Russia since the war started, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n\n>Mazepin, who heads the fertilizer committee at Russia\u2019s biggest business group, said he didn\u2019t see consolidation in the industry as likely now. \u201cNo one has a competitive advantage - political or otherwise - that would lead to any serious changes,\u201d he said.",

There's been a lot of debate on tanks lately, with commentators even including Elon Musk. Some think they're still the elite calvary of WW2, to be used en masse; others think they ought to be retired and replaced with air power. In truth, this debate has been going on since we invented planes--and we will likely still be debating it a hundred years from now.\n\nThat being said, I think what Rybar says is mostly correct: that Russia foolishly used tanks at the start, that they are forced to innovate new tactics, and that correct application of said tactics is leading to advances on the ground. \n\nThe next question we have to ask is: how can Ukraine counter this? Well, I am certainly no expert, but the simplest solution is often best: give them more tanks and give them more drones. While we debate how useful a tank really is in the grand scheme of costs versus utility--we know tanks work. We can see them working for the Russians and the Syrians, day in and day out. Could every Abrams we send end up getting destroyed--or worse, captured? Possibly. \n\nBut the cost of victory in war is always high. People sacrifice their lives, and we ought to be able to do the same to our heavy equipment. And if a tank can help save lives, all the more reason to send it on. I know one thing: if I was a soldier in Ukraine right now, I'd rather be in a unit with tank support than in one without.",

In truth, this debate has been going on since we invented planes--and we will likely still be debating it a hundred years from now.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I think what Rybar says is mostly correct: that Russia foolishly used tanks at the start, that they are forced to innovate new tactics, and that correct application of said tactics is leading to advances on the ground. </p>\n\n<p>The next question we have to ask is: how can Ukraine counter this? Well, I am certainly no expert, but the simplest solution is often best: give them more tanks and give them more drones. While we debate how useful a tank really is in the grand scheme of costs versus utility--we know tanks work. We can see them working for the Russians and the Syrians, day in and day out. Could every Abrams we send end up getting destroyed--or worse, captured? Possibly. </p>\n\n<p>But the cost of victory in war is always high. People sacrifice their lives, and we ought to be able to do the same to our heavy equipment. And if a tank can help save lives, all the more reason to send it on. I know one thing: if I was a soldier in Ukraine right now, I&#39;d rather be in a unit with tank support than in one without.</p>\n</div>",

In response, Iranian forces in Syria begin to intermittently strike Turkish military targets with missiles, including some on the Turkish side of the border.\n\n1. Is NATO obliged to take action to help Turkey defend itself against these missile strikes?\n\n2. Is NATO obliged to *escalate* in response to these missile strikes?\n\n3. Regardless of obligation, would NATO take military action against Iranian forces in response to these missile strikes?\n\nAs far as actual legal obligations go, Article 5 is deliberately vague. It obliges each party to take \"such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area\". \n\nMy answers are, respectively: I don't know, probably not, and yes. In other words, NATO's actual collective action, and its individual members' actions, reflect its policy priorities, not the legal interpretation of the North Atlantic Charter - because that's how the Charter is designed. In that case, I think NATO politics would lean more toward a military response - for example, striking Iranian military installations in Syria - even though the Charter doesn't legally compel such a response.\n\n-----\n\nI think the answer to your question is similar. A Russian military response against Polish territory would be even less justified and more unprovoked than the hypothetical Iranian military response against Turkish territory, and legally there would be fewer questions about whether Article 5 applies.\n\nBut almost certainly, the rest of NATO would not \"deem it necessary\" to militarily escalate against Russian forces, because such an action would not \"restore and maintain the security\" of Europe.\n\nIf I had to guess the hypothetical response to a hypothetical response to a hypothetical action... I'd guess that NATO deploys additional ISR and air defense assets to eastern Poland, and engages any missiles or aircraft that appear to threaten Polish territory. (The alliance could tighten or loosen its criteria for which missiles or aircraft \"appear to threaten Polish territory\" as another lever to influence Russian behavior.)\n\nNATO aside, I'm not sure why Russia would want to escalate against Poland. If its impotent missile strikes bring in Poland as a belligerent alongside Ukraine, it seems to me that it would reduce Russia's chances of achieving its military objectives from \"very low\" to \"actually zero\".",

In response, Iranian forces in Syria begin to intermittently strike Turkish military targets with missiles, including some on the Turkish side of the border.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is NATO obliged to take action to help Turkey defend itself against these missile strikes?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is NATO obliged to <em>escalate</em> in response to these missile strikes?</p></li>\n<li><p>Regardless of obligation, would NATO take military action against Iranian forces in response to these missile strikes?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As far as actual legal obligations go, Article 5 is deliberately vague. It obliges each party to take &quot;such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>My answers are, respectively: I don&#39;t know, probably not, and yes. In other words, NATO&#39;s actual collective action, and its individual members&#39; actions, reflect its policy priorities, not the legal interpretation of the North Atlantic Charter - because that&#39;s how the Charter is designed. In that case, I think NATO politics would lean more toward a military response - for example, striking Iranian military installations in Syria - even though the Charter doesn&#39;t legally compel such a response.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I think the answer to your question is similar. A Russian military response against Polish territory would be even less justified and more unprovoked than the hypothetical Iranian military response against Turkish territory, and legally there would be fewer questions about whether Article 5 applies.</p>\n\n<p>But almost certainly, the rest of NATO would not &quot;deem it necessary&quot; to militarily escalate against Russian forces, because such an action would not &quot;restore and maintain the security&quot; of Europe.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to guess the hypothetical response to a hypothetical response to a hypothetical action... I&#39;d guess that NATO deploys additional ISR and air defense assets to eastern Poland, and engages any missiles or aircraft that appear to threaten Polish territory. (The alliance could tighten or loosen its criteria for which missiles or aircraft &quot;appear to threaten Polish territory&quot; as another lever to influence Russian behavior.)</p>\n\n<p>NATO aside, I&#39;m not sure why Russia would want to escalate against Poland. If its impotent missile strikes bring in Poland as a belligerent alongside Ukraine, it seems to me that it would reduce Russia&#39;s chances of achieving its military objectives from &quot;very low&quot; to &quot;actually zero&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

Western sourced Soviet MBT\u2019s will eventually run out and there needs to be a way to pivot towards a different design.\n\nThey made the case for the K2 or K1 being the taboo answer. There are roughly 1000 K1\u2019s in service and 500 K2\u2019s in the South Korean army. It is my opinion that these systems are almost certainly not going to be used in a conflict anytime soon, the Korean Peninsular conflict has been frozen for decades and theres been no indication of any major rises in tension. The Chinese aren\u2019t going to view this as escalatory. With the South Korean and Polish deal being worked on the SK MIC is going to firing on all cylinders for a while now meaning they can probably replace these donations relatively shortly.\n\nThe talk of donating Leopards and Challenger\u2019s is good and I support the need for more heavy, offensive weaponry for Ukraine but it feels like we are placing cones around a pothole on this issue. With huge stockpiles of Bradleys in storage, the Zaluzhnyi figure of 300 MBT\u2019s and 600IFV\u2019s can be met (even if this figure is OTT and they only need half of that figure).",

They've been relatively consistently (but slowly) pushing forward on the southern pincer and are now consistently pushing forward on the northern pincer too, so with the status quo I think it's inevitable they'll get there.

Russia can round up a million or two Syrians at gunpoint and bring them to Belarus and Kaliningrad. Half of them can be released into Poland in order to cause confusion and chaos. The other half can be dosed with meth, PCP, Krokodil, and whatever other drugs are on hand, armed with machetes, hammers, axes, knives, sharpened sticks, etc., and forced to charge at Kyiv in order to waste the Ukrainians\u2019 ammunition and cause more confusion and chaos (of course, soldiers with machine guns will be behind them to shoot any who don\u2019t charge).\n\nNext, a series of amphibious landings will be performed in southern Ukraine. Russia has 1.4K cargo ships, I think. 200 of these can be loaded with 2000 mobiks each. They will be armed with any available Kalashnikovs, PPSh-41s, Mosin-Nagants, and any other available guns, as well as Molotov cocktails. They will be dressed in civilian clothing, and given a decent supply of ammunition in their ships. These ships will sail from Crimea, beach themselves along Ukraine\u2019s southern coast, and unload their soldiers into Ukraine. Ukraine does not have enough missiles to sink all these ships. These soldiers will attack Odessa, Mykolaiv, and all the smaller cities in the region. More soldiers will cross into Kherson via rowboats, motorboats, and rafts to do the same thing. Even more soldiers can cross the Dnieper at other points. They will blend into the civilian population and go on an uncontrolled rampage of raping, looting, and murdering. No attempt will be made to organize them in any way or to resupply them (they can capture supplies from Ukrainian civilians). This will cause great confusion and chaos, so that it will take Ukraine lots of time and lives to kill all these mobiks (because they aren\u2019t wearing uniforms, have no command structure and thus cannot be made to surrender en masse, are mixed with civilians and thus must be cleared out by infantry instead of artillery, and as the atrocities they have committed will make the Ukrainians not want to offer them any mercy).\n\nAfter that, some Spetsnaz will be sent to Hungary and infiltrate into Ukraine from the west. They will sow confusion and chaos by ambushing random civilians, massacring small villages at night, planting land mines and IEDs everywhere, starting fires, destroying infrastructure and sniping the people who come to fix it, etc. A bunch of Russia\u2019s most deranged criminals and asylum inmates will be sent with them, to create as much mayhem as possible. This will also make the European countries hesitate to take in Ukrainian refugees, as doing so might allow these criminals into their countries.\n\nFinally, the knockout blow will come in the form of an armored thrust from the western part of Belarus. They will set out from Brest and push south to Moldova. It will involve most of Russia\u2019s available artillery, armor, and experienced soldiers, as well as maybe a million mobiks to absorb fire and overwhelm the Ukrainian defenders using a tidal wave of bodies (commissars, blocking troops, and drugs will be used to motivate the mobiks). Russia\u2019s current positions in South and East Ukraine will be abandoned to provide manpower and equipment for this push (if Ukraine tries to exploit this weakness, it will only spread their forces out more), though some prisoners or Syrians can be chained to bunkers overlooking minefields and equipped with a Mosin-Nagant to slow the Ukrainian advance and inflict casualties.\n\nWestern Ukraine has largely been unaffected by the war other than by some missiles, so Ukraine probably does not have a lot of ground forces here and will find it hard to resist this push. Once the push reaches Moldova, Ukraine will find it impossible to get resupplied from the west, and will probably bleed out in a few months at most. \n\nRussia will probably take under 3 million losses (2 million Russians and 1 million Syrians). If more warm bodies are needed, Russia can always just grab some more prisoners (currently 558k prisoners in Russia), kidnapped Ukrainians, Syrians, or Africans, give them a gun or knife if available, a pointy stick if not, and throw them at Ukraine.\n\nWhat do you think about this plan?",

It wouldn't.\n\nA few things why not and please note that at the end the percentages are just a gut feeling then anything else, but I would say they are close enough to the real chance. They can be off ofc.\n\n\"The Herd\"\n\n* \"Gathering\" 1-2 million of Syrian refugees is not something that is easy and can be done without being noticed. (Remember, the \"same\" trick was tried a bit back at the Belarus-Polish border and it failed)\n* Getting 1 million people drugged and armed at the same time is, also difficult. Also many substance you mention does not just make ppl blindly follow orders, even if you manage to \"herd\" these people towards the defensive lines without them being killed, run in every which way, shooting at your people etc. (they will still be detected way before). It wouldn't do much. They would be slaughtered and I an tell you that a drugged human without any incentive that can choose between the artillery fire and dug in position or to go against their \"herders\" will choose probably against the herders. \n* Overall chance of success is lower then 1-2% \n\n\"The Discount Normandy\"\n\n* Civilian ferries cannot be used in opposed landings, you need some kind of defense at least, they are obvious day before the operations and can be taken out with \"minimal effort\". Even if they arrive to the shores, they are probably are moved down by a few IFVs and defenders on the beaches, but even before that, kamikaze boats, ant-ship missiles etc. several hundred-thousands dead, tons and tons of war material loss and even if they are older stuff, you had to manage their logistics up until this point. Meaning all of your other forces are significantly under supplied.  Even if they do manage to land, what are they gonna do? Russia would need to keep supplying them for at least a few days by see under constant enemy fires and counterattacks. It wouldn't be a threat at all basically.\n* russian navy have around 5 surface ships and probably similar number of subs. The military ships don't dare to go near to the shores and you think a mass of civilian boats would do the trick? Ukraine coastal defenses would have the easiest and most glorious moment of their life (glorious as in defending their homeland, it would be hardly called a battle and more like a slaughter). \n* Overall chance of success is lower then 4%.  \n\n\"The blitz from Hungary\"\n\n* Overall this has the most probable success chance, but also would pretty much cause only more outrage. Both in Ukraine, in the west and even with neutral countries. You can say you are targeting civilian infra for strategic reasons, you can say that according to your intel that hospital was a military target, that civilian tower was a malfunctioning missile etc etc. You cannot sell this as anything but a terror operation. The West would follow by the largest uptick in aid, popular support would be impossible to break down for at least half a year. Ukrainians spirit would double down, probably with unwanted consequences.\n* The Hungarian angle of attack might even work out for a very small number of agents. Deep behind enemy lines waiting to be killed and for what? Some killed civilian and some damaged infrastructure in an area that overall does not matter much in the defense of Ukraine. If anything is the target, it is the Polish-Ukraine border. Even more restricted as actual military gear is flowing there. In Hungary I can see a few (5-50) SOF soldier slipping through but it is a risk, but only with shitty equipment very close to the border etc. The criminals would be more likely to kill their jailors and get the hell out then follow your imagined operation. Maybe from Moldova, the enclave can try to do something like that, but it would just be a reason to crush it. Both Moldova and Ukraine would take it out after this within days.\n* It is kind of easy to identify people, it wouldn't effect Ukrainian refugees (who are already left the country or are actually COMING BACK). \n* Overall chance of success is lower then 10%. (and by success here, I mean getting into Ukraine and shoot up a few people and maybe mine a road, because they ran out of explosives, all they have what they might carry and even that had to be flow into Hungary, so its not like they are there fully equipped)  \n\n\"The tidal wave from the north\"\n\n* What you describe is way ahead of russian capabilities, meaning that weeks before it, it would be identified and maybe even more importantly, would make the entire Donbass and Crimea look like that Kharkiv Oblast was a heavily defended area. Literally UAF would be able to almost just walk in. Take positions and start to dig in.\n* Tidal wave of bodies, and I am sorry for my language here, is just retarded in modern warfare. It wasn't smart in WW1 and today is just that, retarded. The casualties inflicted would be so disproportionate that the entire offensive would by exhausted very fast. Currently the situation is that around 100 man is \"manning\" 3-5 kms of front, because if there are just a few soldier, they don't worth calling out artillery that gets discovered by artillery's radar and get counter fired on it if he can't run away fast enough) We are dispersing because the weapons we have as modern humans are way to destructive to be able to overwhelm by bodies. Have you seen the Avatar (bluealiens) movie? Have you ever saw what an old 50 cal can do? In reality, that \"mass of animals charging\" would have been a massacre the other way around. I don't care what kind of super strong bones you have, those weapons are designed against armored vehicles, troops etc. They would have killed them way faster then they can charge.\n* Just to add to the above mentioned issue, we see old, sometimes even WW1 Maxims? Well, I sit in a well dug in position at the end of a road with it and with 3 more soldiers. You and 50 of your pals are to charge us in a flat land, of around 1000-500 meters. You would hate that Maxim soooo very very much and even if you scatter, cover fire etc. might not have very good chances without artillery and any kind of supports.\n* The chained up soldiers defending the position is .... my god, why would they do that? Literally they can just sit down and wait for the Ukrainians to free them and then laugh at how retarded the russians were. \n* UAF would take a smaller amount of time to move then the russians, (shorter distance to start with) while keeping this hidden is basically impossible. UAF already have defensive positions and people expanding those just as they \"rest\".\n* Overall chance of success is lower then 3%\n\nThe entire thing that you offer is an almost sure way for russia to lose this war quick and painless basically. It cannot be taken seriously.",

It wouldn&#39;t be a threat at all basically.</li>\n<li>russian navy have around 5 surface ships and probably similar number of subs. The military ships don&#39;t dare to go near to the shores and you think a mass of civilian boats would do the trick? Ukraine coastal defenses would have the easiest and most glorious moment of their life (glorious as in defending their homeland, it would be hardly called a battle and more like a slaughter). </li>\n<li>Overall chance of success is lower then 4%.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&quot;The blitz from Hungary&quot;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Overall this has the most probable success chance, but also would pretty much cause only more outrage. Both in Ukraine, in the west and even with neutral countries. You can say you are targeting civilian infra for strategic reasons, you can say that according to your intel that hospital was a military target, that civilian tower was a malfunctioning missile etc etc. You cannot sell this as anything but a terror operation. The West would follow by the largest uptick in aid, popular support would be impossible to break down for at least half a year. Ukrainians spirit would double down, probably with unwanted consequences.</li>\n<li>The Hungarian angle of attack might even work out for a very small number of agents. Deep behind enemy lines waiting to be killed and for what? Some killed civilian and some damaged infrastructure in an area that overall does not matter much in the defense of Ukraine. If anything is the target, it is the Polish-Ukraine border. Even more restricted as actual military gear is flowing there. In Hungary I can see a few (5-50) SOF soldier slipping through but it is a risk, but only with shitty equipment very close to the border etc. The criminals would be more likely to kill their jailors and get the hell out then follow your imagined operation. Maybe from Moldova, the enclave can try to do something like that, but it would just be a reason to crush it. Both Moldova and Ukraine would take it out after this within days.</li>\n<li>It is kind of easy to identify people, it wouldn&#39;t effect Ukrainian refugees (who are already left the country or are actually COMING BACK). </li>\n<li>Overall chance of success is lower then 10%. (and by success here, I mean getting into Ukraine and shoot up a few people and maybe mine a road, because they ran out of explosives, all they have what they might carry and even that had to be flow into Hungary, so its not like they are there fully equipped)<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&quot;The tidal wave from the north&quot;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What you describe is way ahead of russian capabilities, meaning that weeks before it, it would be identified and maybe even more importantly, would make the entire Donbass and Crimea look like that Kharkiv Oblast was a heavily defended area. Literally UAF would be able to almost just walk in. Take positions and start to dig in.</li>\n<li>Tidal wave of bodies, and I am sorry for my language here, is just retarded in modern warfare. It wasn&#39;t smart in WW1 and today is just that, retarded. The casualties inflicted would be so disproportionate that the entire offensive would by exhausted very fast. Currently the situation is that around 100 man is &quot;manning&quot; 3-5 kms of front, because if there are just a few soldier, they don&#39;t worth calling out artillery that gets discovered by artillery&#39;s radar and get counter fired on it if he can&#39;t run away fast enough) We are dispersing because the weapons we have as modern humans are way to destructive to be able to overwhelm by bodies. Have you seen the Avatar (bluealiens) movie? Have you ever saw what an old 50 cal can do? In reality, that &quot;mass of animals charging&quot; would have been a massacre the other way around. I don&#39;t care what kind of super strong bones you have, those weapons are designed against armored vehicles, troops etc. They would have killed them way faster then they can charge.</li>\n<li>Just to add to the above mentioned issue, we see old, sometimes even WW1 Maxims? Well, I sit in a well dug in position at the end of a road with it and with 3 more soldiers. You and 50 of your pals are to charge us in a flat land, of around 1000-500 meters. You would hate that Maxim soooo very very much and even if you scatter, cover fire etc. might not have very good chances without artillery and any kind of supports.</li>\n<li>The chained up soldiers defending the position is .... my god, why would they do that? Literally they can just sit down and wait for the Ukrainians to free them and then laugh at how retarded the russians were. </li>\n<li>UAF would take a smaller amount of time to move then the russians, (shorter distance to start with) while keeping this hidden is basically impossible. UAF already have defensive positions and people expanding those just as they &quot;rest&quot;.</li>\n<li>Overall chance of success is lower then 3%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The entire thing that you offer is an almost sure way for russia to lose this war quick and painless basically. It cannot be taken seriously.</p>\n</div>",

It would take massive logistics that spans across borders. Even if you pushed, say half, into Poland (which may very well trigger Article V and bring NATO into the war), there is no way that Russia would voluntarily give another million small arms inside of Belarus or Russia. Not to mention that it strains Russia's logistics capability beyond its breaking point.\n\nAmphibious landings are currently not within Russia's capability in the Black Sea. They do not have enough ships and the coast is protected by ASM. Even if Russia was to land troops by just beaching cargo ships, it would still have to supply those troops that are cut off. Ukraine would see this coming from - literally - miles away and would properly respond. Remember that any amphibious assault is most vulnerable on landing before it gets significantly inland, and you must control the seas (remember the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal). If you do not control the sea lanes, then your ships are driven out and it is most likely you lose your entire amphibious assault force.\n\nSimply saying, \"we're not going to resupply them\" isn't realistic. Do you know what you call an airborne division that has been behind enemy lines for 3 days without resupply? You call them POWs. Resupply is necessary otherwise the force quickly becomes spent.\n\nThe Hungary \"infiltration\" would not work either and is impactable (not to mention that it would cause an international incident and may very well invoke Article 4). Having units larger than, say, 20 (to be generous) would be picked up by NATO. And as much as Hungary is spatting with NATO and the EU right now, it doesn't want Russia troops on its land and it doesn't want to so anger the EU / NATO that it may be severely sanctioned and/or booted out (I'm aware of the mechanisms or lack thereof, but mechanisms can be changed).\n\nThe armored attack you proposed must cross swamp grounds with few roads. It would be a disaster for Russia and Belarus (if Belarus even joins, and they have been trying to not get actively involved) because the armor would be forced to take a few smaller and well defended roads. It's prime tank hunting grounds, and light infantry would hold up and destroy columns of tanks using ATGMs.\n\nI think this plan is unrealistic, and quite frankly, terrible.\n\n(edit - nits)",

And as much as Hungary is spatting with NATO and the EU right now, it doesn&#39;t want Russia troops on its land and it doesn&#39;t want to so anger the EU / NATO that it may be severely sanctioned and/or booted out (I&#39;m aware of the mechanisms or lack thereof, but mechanisms can be changed).</p>\n\n<p>The armored attack you proposed must cross swamp grounds with few roads. It would be a disaster for Russia and Belarus (if Belarus even joins, and they have been trying to not get actively involved) because the armor would be forced to take a few smaller and well defended roads. It&#39;s prime tank hunting grounds, and light infantry would hold up and destroy columns of tanks using ATGMs.</p>\n\n<p>I think this plan is unrealistic, and quite frankly, terrible.</p>\n\n<p>(edit - nits)</p>\n</div>",
