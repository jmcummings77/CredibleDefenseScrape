Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The junta agreed to recognize MNDAA control over Kokang, and to divide customs proceeds (70% MNDAA/30% junta) from border trade through Chinshwehaw. Talks are ongoing for the details of trade fees through Muse (more complex, as the city is surrounded by the TNLA but remains under government control). Both sides pledged to withdraw troops from points of contact and to \"safeguard Chinese interests.\" More talks are scheduled for April. \n\nThe Chinese-brokered ceasefire from January has held, albeit with sporadic skirmishes, and it seems the MNDAA/TNLA have decided to cash in their gains, as it were. The AA has continued fighting in Rakhine. Interestingly, this statement was issued by the Northern Alliance (Brotherhood+KIA) rather than just the Brotherhood Alliance. The KIA has longstanding ties with the other ethnic groups, including arms and training, but did not formally participate in Operation 1027. It is currently fighting in Kachin, in coordination with PDFs, and is notable for having closer ties to the NUG than the Brotherhood. Some rumors even claim the KIA has served as intermediaries in the past. \n\nNeedless to say, Chinese fingerprints are all over this and they are clearly the biggest beneficiaries of the deal since a stabilized border means the resumption of lucrative semi-illicit trade in raw materials, alongside the new consensus towards disallowing scamming/smuggling. The junta has officially suffered a serious setback, but they'd already lost the territory and are just recognizing the reality on the ground. In practice, Kokang was always a restive border region and who governs it (BGF out, MNDAA in) has always been a tenuous thing subject to outside influence. Arguably the impetus for the whole offensive was the junta claiming that they couldn't control the BGF and get them to rein in the aforementioned scamming/smuggling, to which China said \"fine I'll do it myself.\" The biggest losers of this deal are the remaining anti-junta resistance forces, not only because the junta is no longer fighting the best-equipped resistance faction (ceasefire was in January), but rather because of the implications w.r.t. warlordism and fragmentation. An ethnic minority compelling the national government to effectively recognize its sovereignty by force is a very dangerous precedent to set, and a narrative the junta has [consistently deployed](https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/guest-column/disintegration-the-most-dangerous-myanmar-narrative-and-how-to-counter-it.html) in its efforts to rally support or at least grudging acceptance from the urban Bamar (ethnic majority) populace. The NUG has repeatedly attempted to promote the vaguely defined idea of a \"federal union\" to counteract this narrative, but the fact of the matter is that the bulk of the muscle behind the resistance is provided by ethnic armies, and it should come as no surprise that they have their own agenda.

But a ship anchor dragged in the general direction of the cable has a relatively higher probability of hitting the cable because it will cross a larger area of the sea floor, dragging over many potential cable positions rather than falling directly on top of a single, localized possible position. Meaning, it would take a lot of bad luck for the ship to happen to sink directly over the cable, but less bad luck for it to drag an anchor over the cable. For context, [something like 30-40% of incidents resulting in damage to submarine cables can be attributed to anchor dragging](https://www-geo.eng.cam.ac.uk/system/files/documents/2017MooreE.pdf), so anchor dragging poses a real danger to undersea cables even when the ship in question is not operating in a congested waterway that provides little buffer zone between the shipping channel and cable path, never mind when the ship also happens to be under missile attack by terrorists and thus unable to operate in a regular, cable-safe manner.",

It totally made possible the defense of the Donbas, as well as four counteroffensive performed in 2022 (April Kharkiv, May Kherson, September Kherson, Sept Kharkiv).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>and we spent the better part of the tail end of 2022 into the early months of 2023 training Ukrainian brigades.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was actually early 2023, and those were the new brigades meant for the counteroffensive that were going to be fully kitted out by various NATO countries, who also assisted them with their individual and unit training.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>2023 was also when we started supplying munitions like DPICM and ATACMS to Ukraine to support this goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the Ukrainian counteroffensive stalled and the 300k ROK arty shells weren&#39;t going to be enough, that&#39;s when DPICM was unlocked for Ukraine.

But it also doesn't mean that the *reason* for withholding the aid is because half the US government doubts Ukraine's prospects for defeating Russia on the battlefield. Much of the resistance to further aid is because of political realignment towards Russian favoritism.

But it also doesn&#39;t mean that the <em>reason</em> for withholding the aid is because half the US government doubts Ukraine&#39;s prospects for defeating Russia on the battlefield. Much of the resistance to further aid is because of political realignment towards Russian favoritism.

You can build it on a rudimentary assembly line mostly by hand, and you will get a few hundred per year. You can build it on a more sophisticated assembly line by hand, and get a few thousand per year. You can build it on a heavily automated assembly line, and you get a lot more units per year.\n\nThe costs fall drastically as you go down the steps, per unit. You have a very high up-front cost as you go down the steps, but that is the trade-off. But if you managed to actually go down the steps, you end up with some insane cost reductions; a car that is built on an assembly line is easily 10 to 20x cheaper than a car built by hand. Pretty much all western AFV procurement is on small enough batches that they are built by hand for all practical intents and purposes.\n\nBut if someone can order enough of the things to make building a proper assembly line worthwhile, and building them the way that a civilian company would, then costs can be lower, a lot lower. And if that is the goal, to build one proper assembly line to churn out *something* cheaply, and then use that something for everything, then that is a reasonable plan to me.

That means whereever the infantry are located, that is where the ATGMs will be located and used to support those units, especially on the defense (they are hard to use offensively). So if the infantry can see armor, they can kill armor. \n\nMeanwhile, dedicated military-grade \"loitering munition\", aka Kamikaze drones (like Switchblade or Lancet), were developed before this war and were also supposed to be mass issued to the infantry platoons and companies. And FPV drones started out this war largely with enterprising UAF troops at the company level figuring out better ways to kill Russian troops with cheap drones they were being issued primarily meant for ISR purposes, at which point they started rigging up various munitions to them. \n\nBut what has made FPV drones really stand out in terms of effectiveness was that since mid-2023 to today the FPV drone operators are largely being grouped into dedicated FPV drone strike companies that are tied into tactical commands, sometimes battalion but most often at the brigade/regimental level, where they are dedicated parts of a recon fires complex (system) kill chain. \n\nSimilarly, better ISR/ISTARS drones spot targets, and the tactical level commands, who are watching those feeds, work up immediate fire missions to destroy those targets. So now, besides dumb mortars, tube arty, or rockets, besides limited number of PGM arty or rockets, they have LOTS of FPV drones, which with the right weather, lighting conditions, and lack of EW, are quite lethal. \n\nAnd with lots of FPV drones at their disposal, the recon fires complex cells colocated at the tactical HQs can call on them more, effectively massing FPV fires no different than massing batteries of arty for concentrated artillery fire missions. Hence single AFV often ending up getting hit by multiple FPV drones until they are catastrophically killed. That's not left up to FPV drone operators, they're being assigned that target as part of an official fire mission. \n\nNot only is that tactic impossible to replicate with ATGMs, its not meant to be. The point of ATGMs is to give the infantry their own ability to kill armor at standoff ranges, with the benefit being that most can now compete with the max effective range of the tanks and IFV cannons. If the Ukrainians and Russians were using FPV drones that way, they'd be far less effective than they are. And yet they both still need to keep a dedicated anti-tank capability for the small unit infantry, for the same reason that they can't be assured they'll be prioritized with arty support let alone airstrikes, at this point they might not get drone support either, unless the tactical level commands task organize it to lower levels.",

Let's say that a left leaning, long lasting government did the semi-impossible and achieved all these peace-promoting steps *while being attacked daily by at least 3 different terror orgs*. A very optimistic timeframe for such an undertaking is 5-10 years (again, I imagine no government in any country has achieved this). \n\nNow, how did those steps bring Israel closer to peace with the Palestinians? What is your understanding of the various civilian and military factions and their purposes, that makes you think these steps are significant steps towards peace?\n\nAnd to add, what kind of conclusions do you think the Palestinian population, leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas, PIJ, Fatah, Houthis et. al arrive at, when they see major left-leaning policies being implemented in response to the Oct 7 massacre? What do they do with these conclusions, and what of their puppet masters?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nIsrael/Palestine is a topic I try to discuss exclusively in this subreddit. There are two reasons for that:\n\n1. This subreddit is somewhat narrow in focus (military) and moderation is strict. So the likelihood of running into insightful or at least not-garbage analysis of military operations and climate is much higher than other subreddits. Re Israel/Palestine discussion, even just for military, it is rare to find a good example of it outside of military academia so it is nice to find it here occasionally.\n\n2. The focus is specifically military. This is an important reason for me because the geopolitical aspect of Israel/Palestine is *much* more complex than its military one. Generally to understand the military realities of Israel you just need to have some military experience / scholarly knowledge, and be somewhat open minded.  This is a much higher bar than the general population, but a *much* lower bar than what it takes to be versed in the geopolitical aspect.\n\n\nIt is one of those cases where some random 16 year old in Israel is likely *less wrong* than a military versed 55 year old in most other countries. \n\nGood military analysis is somewhat achievable in a Reddit format when it comes to Israel/Palestine, you just need people who are patient enough to read & write extra long comments.  Not so with the geopolitical aspect. AskHistorians comes somewhat close and is normally x10 / x15 longer than here. This is why I cannot hope for your comment on Reddit to be anywhere near as extensive as it needs to be to argue your point, nor would I presume you to expect me to be as extensive. As you said, neither of us will submit a thesis here, and a meaningful discussion of the geopolitical aspect is a discussion of competing theses.\n\nIf you happen to know of any good ones, I'll be very interested to read anything like that.\n\nIn any case, I'll be happy to read your reply and I appreciate the discussion. Have a good one.",

What is your understanding of the various civilian and military factions and their purposes, that makes you think these steps are significant steps towards peace?</p>\n\n<p>And to add, what kind of conclusions do you think the Palestinian population, leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas, PIJ, Fatah, Houthis et. al arrive at, when they see major left-leaning policies being implemented in response to the Oct 7 massacre? What do they do with these conclusions, and what of their puppet masters?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Israel/Palestine is a topic I try to discuss exclusively in this subreddit. There are two reasons for that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This subreddit is somewhat narrow in focus (military) and moderation is strict. So the likelihood of running into insightful or at least not-garbage analysis of military operations and climate is much higher than other subreddits. Re Israel/Palestine discussion, even just for military, it is rare to find a good example of it outside of military academia so it is nice to find it here occasionally.</p></li>\n<li><p>The focus is specifically military. This is an important reason for me because the geopolitical aspect of Israel/Palestine is <em>much</em> more complex than its military one. Generally to understand the military realities of Israel you just need to have some military experience / scholarly knowledge, and be somewhat open minded.  This is a much higher bar than the general population, but a <em>much</em> lower bar than what it takes to be versed in the geopolitical aspect.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is one of those cases where some random 16 year old in Israel is likely <em>less wrong</em> than a military versed 55 year old in most other countries. </p>\n\n<p>Good military analysis is somewhat achievable in a Reddit format when it comes to Israel/Palestine, you just need people who are patient enough to read &amp; write extra long comments.  Not so with the geopolitical aspect. AskHistorians comes somewhat close and is normally x10 / x15 longer than here. This is why I cannot hope for your comment on Reddit to be anywhere near as extensive as it needs to be to argue your point, nor would I presume you to expect me to be as extensive. As you said, neither of us will submit a thesis here, and a meaningful discussion of the geopolitical aspect is a discussion of competing theses.</p>\n\n<p>If you happen to know of any good ones, I&#39;ll be very interested to read anything like that.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I&#39;ll be happy to read your reply and I appreciate the discussion. Have a good one.</p>\n</div>",

One side points to one thing as justification, the other side points to a past wrong to justify that thing, etc. etc. The plus side is that everyone gets to feel morally justified in their position, but the downside is once you go down that rabbit hole it's difficult to escape it. That's a big reason I'm emphasizing that the cycle needs to be broken, as it's a massive and fundamental roadblock to progress.\n\nIn the hypothetical- the benefit to those actions is it creates a foundation of trust. Obviously the other side needs to do similar things too, but *somebody* needs to go first and stick with it. The blame cycle just gets in the way of this obvious first step, as no negotiation can effectively proceed without trust. A political solution **must** be found eventually if the violence is to end or even be curtailed. Historically the only other method for resolving conflict is genocide, which is ultimately untenable for either side for a variety of reasons. After the past few months I don't think you can argue Hamas would be \"rewarded\" for Oct. 7 if Israel started taking these measures. Indeed as I understand it such actions would merely be enforcing existing laws Bibi's government has elected to not enforce. Hold the position they could be developed in the future depending on whatever negotiated settlement is achieved, but in the meantime Israel demonstrates its capability to be a good faith partner that honors its own laws and commitments.\n\nIn terms of military escalation, I think it's important to note the temperature dial is very far from the max even now. The IDF is not built for extended large scale operations- it needs to be quick and decisive because the country's smaller size and population makes sustaining manpower more difficult. If even the short term objectives are to be met, the IDF would need to take and hold significant portions of Lebanon to substantially degrade Hezbollah the same way they have Hamas. Gently speaking, the IDF did not have the best showing the last time it went into Lebanon, and the task would likely be even more difficult next time. Iranian support would flow in more than ever, and the current state of Syria means manpower and weapons can flow in and the IDF would be hard pressed to stop them. Politically, it gives a boost to Hezbollah and its ideologies as they will take on the mantle of defenders of Lebanese sovereignty given the state of the country's government. It's big risks to *maybe* curtail rocket attacks for a year or 2 at best if history holds, and that doesn't even get into the maritime woes Iran is likely to increase as a response. At what point do Israel's allies throw their hands up and determine their support causes too many headaches for their other interests to be worth it? That's a real risk, and I think pushing things in that direction is a core component of Hamas and Iran's overall strategy (and possibly quite effective the longer Bibi's government remains the POC for such aid).\n\nThe rocket attacks are terrible, tragic, and uncalled for, but ultimately not an existential risk to Israel. Loss or reduction of US aid could be. Frankly, Israel would get far better returns on investment for its security finding ways to increase stability in both Lebanon and Syria with some regional partners with mutual interests. Invading Lebanon is a surefire way to make sure Israel is bordering another completely failed state for decades to come, and all the terror risks associated with that.",

It's difficult to see where all of it would come from, especially these days, now that cities are mostly concrete and steel. \n\nBut, what's worse, is that they make absolutely **wild** assumptions about how much soot it would take to cause mass crop failures. The second linked study asserts that it would only take 5Tg (5 million tons) of soot to cause this. And they have models showing billions dead from a maximum estimated 50Tg, which might cause -4C of global cooling, according to them.\n\nMy problem with their models is they aren't even close to what we measurably know from observed volcanic winters, the closest comparable phenomena. \n\nTake the latest largest volcanic eruptions in recent history. Krakatoa and Pinatubo. Both ejected roughly ~20 million tons of soot. And keep in mind, this is mainly sulfur, which has more global dimming effect than carbon. In both eruptions, 20Tg of atmospheric soot was enough to produce roughly -0.5C of global cooling, and did not cause large crop failures anywhere in the world. This is especially relevant for Pinatubo as that was 30 years ago, during the age of our modern agricultural production model. No mass starvation at 20Tg, when this paper is insisting lots of death with as little as 5Tg. \n\nBut let's look at the WORST CASE scenario. Tambora. The last volcanic eruption to produce large climate change in recent human history, causing the \"Year without a winter\" that did lead to widespread famine. This eruption caused roughly -1.5C of global cooling (it should also be reminded that this was -1.5C in 1815, meaning a whopping -3C compared to 2022). We don't have a good fix on how much soot Tambora produced, but the upper estimate puts it above 100 million tons (100Tg). So being more generous to their study, if we assumed that Tambora was 60Tg (3x as big as Krakatoa and Pinatubo, going by the atmospheric effect) we can see that the model in this paper, which estimates -4C, is *wildly off*. I also want to point out, its estimated the eruption was equal in power to 33 gigatons (33,000 one megaton nuclear weapons in essence). \n\nThe effects of the year without a summer are hard to pin down, due to spotty record keeping, but even in europe, where we have better records, it was only 10s of thousands of dead. Of a population over 100 million. \n\nThe idea that a Tambora-like nuclear scenario would kill *billions* of people is non-credible.",

This is especially relevant for Pinatubo as that was 30 years ago, during the age of our modern agricultural production model. No mass starvation at 20Tg, when this paper is insisting lots of death with as little as 5Tg. </p>\n\n<p>But let&#39;s look at the WORST CASE scenario. Tambora. The last volcanic eruption to produce large climate change in recent human history, causing the &quot;Year without a winter&quot; that did lead to widespread famine. This eruption caused roughly -1.5C of global cooling (it should also be reminded that this was -1.5C in 1815, meaning a whopping -3C compared to 2022). We don&#39;t have a good fix on how much soot Tambora produced, but the upper estimate puts it above 100 million tons (100Tg). So being more generous to their study, if we assumed that Tambora was 60Tg (3x as big as Krakatoa and Pinatubo, going by the atmospheric effect) we can see that the model in this paper, which estimates -4C, is <em>wildly off</em>. I also want to point out, its estimated the eruption was equal in power to 33 gigatons (33,000 one megaton nuclear weapons in essence). </p>\n\n<p>The effects of the year without a summer are hard to pin down, due to spotty record keeping, but even in europe, where we have better records, it was only 10s of thousands of dead. Of a population over 100 million. </p>\n\n<p>The idea that a Tambora-like nuclear scenario would kill <em>billions</em> of people is non-credible.</p>\n</div>",

It doesn't require a lot of soot. \n\nAlso, if you think of the tests performed, even the big ones, the energy is not focused on the ground, but mostly wasted upwards.

When building a bomb, you are interested in the radius of destructive force, not the volume.  The radius of the destruction is a cube root function of the yield. In other words, to double the radius of destruction with one bomb, the yield needs to go up 8X. That means a 100Kt detonation has a destructive radius of 1/4 of a 50Mt bomb. So 20 100kt bombs (2Mt total) is roughly the same destructive force as one 50Mt bomb. \n\nIn other words, 500 100kt bombs is about 50X more destructive than one 50Mt bomb.

One bomb a month gives time for the soot to settle and have a smaller impact on weather. 100 bombs dispersed in 2 days means there will be a lot more soot over a short period of time, meaning a larger impact. \n\nI'd like to see the study and see what their thresholds are.",

Once it wasn't, they had to flip the script to some reason they weren't going to support it to prevent Biden from getting a \"win\".\n\n**Longer version**\n\nIn 2022, Democrats held the Presidency, the Senate, and the House. That's important for later. At the beginning of the 2022 invasion, though, it was really easy to focus on Russia as the bad guy. The invasion plus the atrocities they committed as they pulled out really made it easy for there to be consensus against them. That's the time frame for when the first aid builds were passed with overwhelming numbers. Americans supported the said in overwhelming amounts. \n\nSupport was also easier because Ukraine was taking back big swathes of territory with the pushback from Kyiv and later the Kharkiv offensive during summer and fall. However, in the November 2022 midterms, the House barely flipped to a Republican majority. Between the election and the official starting of the new House members, the House passed additional aid to Ukraine (as well as a budget). That was about $48bn that was thought would see Ukraine through September 2023.\n\nThis created the environment where Republicans could use Ukraine aid against Biden. When the vast majority supported it, they were using the line that Biden was not decisive enough or tough enough in deterring Russia. But it didn't matter what they said because the money was already there; they didn't need to support it more. They also didn't need to vote for aid since they knew it would pass by Democratic votes alone. \n\nWhen aid was needed to be replenished, that's when they would have to put political capital into getting it passed. With some Americans tuning out the status of the war, and the war becoming less \"exciting\", support dropped. The Republicans would have to use some of their own sway to pass aid that their party base wasn't enthusiastic about, and would give a \"win\" to Biden, something they don't want at almost all cost. \n\nAt that point, many began to turn away from it because of any reason they could find. It needed better tracking reporting, the US didn't need to spend money it didn't have, something something Hunter Biden, and that the US should focus on the Border first. The Border was the only thing that caught traction, so that's why aid eventually got entwined with that. Which took five months to get a pretty good deal for Republicans, only for them to shoot it down. Which is where it's at now.\n\nSo to answer your question: it stopped being heavily supported when the \"easy bad guy\" of Russia stopped being so prevalent, and when Republicans lawmakers actually had to do something to get it done.
