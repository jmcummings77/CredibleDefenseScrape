        "body": "After five long days since the news that the city of Moscow was offering a 1,9 million Rubles bonus upon signing a contract for serving in the \u201cSMO\u201d... this bonus [has already become 2,1 million Rubles](https://i.imgur.com/ZGjJIgH.jpeg). Further details [here](https://i.imgur.com/d1V0Ndu.png).\n\nThis offer is currently the best in all of Russia. The basic salary of 210 thousand Rubles per month for a private is increased by additional 50 thousand Rubles per month, funded by the city of Moscow. To this must be added (this doesn't apply just to this offer, actually) a bonus of 8 thousand Rubles for each day of combat operations and 50 thousand Rubles for each kilometer of advance as part of an assault (Storm) detachment, as well as rewards in case of destruction of Ukrainian equipment (e.g. 100 thousand Rubles for a tank).\n\nI think it would be no exaggeration to start calling a bubble what has been happening for the past two months. I bring the example of an offer by the city of Saint Petersburg. By November 2023, this had reached a 1,1 million Rubles bonus (the first time above a million in Russia), in addition to the usual 210,000 Rubles salary and the potential ministerial awards. Until two months ago, the offer had remained exactly the same. At the end of May, the bonus became 1,3 million Rubles. On July 24, an offer by the municipality was published which signing bonus had become 1,7 million Rubles. The day later the Telegram post mentioning this offer was deleted and another one was published where the bonus was 1,8 million Rubles. \n\nhttps://t. me/ordenbat/133\n\nToday the bonus offered by the city of Saint Petersburg [became 1,9 million Rubles](https://i.imgur.com/B1JoOKC.png) (I saw it on VK - on that Telegram channel the new offer hasn't been posted yet).\n\nWealthier federal subjects (outside the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which have always provided the highest bonuses) are also adapting. Yesterday a contract offer was published by the Moscow Oblast, for recruitment into the 2nd Motorized Division and the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA. The bonus was 1,7 million Rubles. Today the bonus provided by the Moscow Oblast has reached 2,1 million Rubles! In general, it seems that by now the threshold of 2 million has already been passed and bonuses are being adjusted to that amount (at this pace who knows which figures we will be seeing in September). Often there is the involvement of private sponsoring companies that make it possible to reach those figures.\n\nNote that there are also young influencers behind the publication of these offers, I imagine paid by the federal subjects. You are also likely to be shown contract ads by browsing e.g. Russian news websites - the offers are highly publicized. Let's recall that, as is specified in almost all offers, the contract offered by a given federal entity is signable by Russian citizens from any region of the country, with travel and accommodation expenses in Moscow, Saint Petersburg or wherever else fully reimbursed (upon presentation of receipts) whether the contract is signed. So it's the highest offers the ones that matter and the benchmarks for the rest of the country, as people interested in serving will naturally go to the places that pay the most to sign a contract. This is very important for the success of the contract offer, as relatively few Muscovites are interested in serving compared to other places - like some Siberian and Far Eastern regions, although in absolute terms the plurality of volunteers come from the regions of Ural and Volga Federal Districts.\n\nThe bonus is usually paid in one or a few installments within 30 days of signing the contract. Those who want to do conversions should keep in mind that the current USD to RUB exchange rate is 1 = 86, although I personally don't like to be writing in USD terms as it makes the figures too susceptible to the exchange rate. What matters to the average Russian is the domestic price level (when the Ruble two years ago had appreciated by 1/3 against the USD, versus 2021 values, certainly the average Russian paid in Rubles was not 1/3 richer). Hence I would rather adjust the figures to the country's inflation, which is relatively high, but certainly not to the level to make these bonus increases any less crazy when adjusted in real terms.\n\nAs for the duration, the contracts usually last only 1 year on paper (some 2 or 3 years), but according to the provisions of the Decree 647 of Sept. 21, 2022, all contracts are automatically extended until the end of the SMO. The only exceptions: those who turn 65, those who are recognized as unfit for service as a result of injury or illness, and those who are convicted as a result of criminal proceedings. The contract can only be terminated by mutual consent between the parties (the serviceman and the MoD).\n\nAn exception seems to be the contracts signed with \"Akhmat\", which allow the serviceman to go home after 4 months if he doesn't want to renew the contract (but logically the bonus is only 100 thousand Rubles). They are sent to Ukraine after 1/2 weeks of training in the \"Russian Special Forces University\" in Gudermes near Grozny (note that 2 weeks of training is the standard, overall: I have come across I don't know how many hundreds of cases of people who had signed a contract and died or went missing within 3/4 weeks after signing). \n\nhttps://t. me/dobrovolci_chechnya/604\n\nWeapons and uniforms are provided by the MoD, but there are many cases of recruits buying better military gear with a part of the bonus money (which is the reason why there is often a lot of heterogeneity in clothing etc. among Russian soldiers in the same unit).\n\nContracts are signable by men from 18 to 60 or 65 years of age, depending on the contract offer (there are also many invitations, at best, or pressures, at worst, to have conscripts sign contracts - not coincidentally quite some MIA notices of boys born in 2006 are beginning to come out). There are no physical requirements other than the absence of transmissible diseases such as HIV or hepatitis. Those with criminal records can join without any issues, as long as they are not for sex offenses against a minor.\n\nThere are also other privileges such as the suspension of property tax payments, access to state-subsidized mortgages, veteran status after the war (which entitles the veteran to monthly payments, tax benefits, priority in medical services, free travel). Last but not least, ongoing criminal and administrative proceedings against the man signing the contract are suspended. The corollary to this is that there are many people who sign a normal contract to avoid jail time in case they are charged for crimes they committed. This is a framework that Ukraine too has since the beginning of the war and is not to be confused with the enlistment of convicts from penal colonies. \n\nIn case of injury, compensation ranges from 350,000 Rubles to 3 million Rubles. In the event of death, the family is entitled to 12 million Rubles, a reversionary pension, cancellation of any loans taken out by the deceased before February 2022; the children will be entitled to access to universities without admission tests and without paying tuition fees. From a poor Russian's point of view, it's understandable that all this money and bonuses can be tempting. What one takes in the first year of a contract signed e.g. with the city of Moscow is probably as much as a Russian from a very poor region could aspire to see in his entire working life (in real terms). \n\nHowever, the current exponential-like growth of bonuses suggests that... there may be difficulties with achieving the recruitment goals which had been set. There are several reasons for this, which we will be analyzing below.",

            "body": "Firstly, we cannot forget the relative strength of the Russian labor market. Unemployment is at an all-time low; the average salary in the defense industry sector has passed 100 thousand Rubles. \n\nhttps://t. me/milinfolive/126908\n\nFor specialized roles it easily touches 150 thousand Rubles. With these figures, the salary of a soldier in the \u201cSMO\u201d is no longer that attractive, considering the risks. That is why the MoD has to compensate by letting the federal subjects offer increasingly insane bonuses.\n\nToday I've come across, in VK, an offer for signing a contract with the Rosgvardia (specifically, for security duties in a shopping mall in Novosibirsk). The signing bonus is 200 thousand Rubles. That is the amount that in the summer 2022 was given as a bonus for those who signed a contract to go to Ukraine. For a job that includes free housing but also the possibility of sleeping in one's own home, as well as the absence of mandatory \"business\" travel to other Russian cities or abroad. The base salary is 40 thousand Rubles, but it comes with numerous state-provided privileges (among others, retiring after 20 years of service for those who want to stay), and it's something that doesn't require any skill other than being a man between 18 and 34 men with a clean criminal record.\n\nIn addition, the growth in bonuses could be due to the willingness by the Russian MoD to increase the grouping in Ukraine (as announced by Syrsky a few days ago, which actually finds me very skeptical), and get the manpower to build the new formations and units being created, which is something that as [we saw](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1dy74ie/comment/lc9vh5d/) a few weeks ago... has some difficulties (note: the 46th and 47th Motorized Divisions of the Southern MD in all probability no longer exist, or rather they were \"on paper\" formations, made up of regiments of the Territorial Forces).\n\nThere could also be a competition between federal subjects, among those who can bring as many men as possible to Ukraine. But there is of course the fourth reason, which is the elephant in the room. The losses of the existing grouping in Ukraine. Which needs to be constantly replenished. The losses are many and there are always more of them.\n\nI have [updated my chart](https://i.imgur.com/DpJMTcN.png), which shows the Russian losses released every week by the \u201cPoisk_in_UA\u201d Telegram channel. This week, too, nearly 1000 identified deaths were recorded (the week represents the date of the discovery/release of the obituary and not the date of actual death, as Mediazona does). \n\nhttps://t. me/poisk_in_ua/69017\n\nThe last times I had given more details on this as well as on the methodology behind my estimates, but I find the current pace of recorded losses to be consistent with an actual figure of Russia's KIAs + MIAs between 300 and 350 per day. I am also personally convinced that their irretrievable losses (KIAs + WIAs permanently out of the war + MIAs + POWs) are at least 20,000 per month, despite the Russian habit (I could bring dozens of examples) of sending men back to the front who would actually need other weeks of rehabilitation, if not a total discharge from service. Just two instances:\n\nhttps://t. me/ne_zhdi_novosti/567\n\nhttps://t. me/ne_zhdi_novosti/590\n\nGoes without saying that the overwhelming majority of the losses happens in the infantry, with the problems it entails in terms of misallocation between specialties; although for the Russians that's a very relative problem: when necessary, it often happens that inside a unit support personnel, mortarmen etc. are sent to the infantry. I had mentioned the case of the 1219th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, manned by mobilized men from Bashkortostan and Penza Oblast, which according to relatives of its servicemen was disbanded, with the men sent to other units as stormtroopers. According to several MIA notices published lately, the men were sent to the 5th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, which is active in the battle for Krasnohorivka. There is [a case](https://i.imgur.com/aQlo5DI.png) (note: North Military District is a mistranslation of the acronym of \"Special Military Operation\") of a missing man who from the engineer-sapper company of the 1219th Regiment who had become a stormtrooper. That actually happens often on the Ukrainian side as well, but this is justified by quite a different situation as to the importance of the war and considering the bigger manpower-related problems.\n\nAs for the enlistment of convicts: this has reduced very sharply compared to late 2022 and much of 2023, for obvious reasons. Last year a very high share of the losses in the infantry were convicts, today this is no longer the case. However, Russia is a large country and with a very large prison population, which is constantly being renewed too. Consequently, the flow of volunteers continues, albeit in a reduced pace (and although today, in \u201cStorm-V\u201d units, the convicts shall serve until the end of \u201cSMO\u201d and no longer for only 6 months). Russian sources, supported by Ukrainian ones, report that the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th CAA, which is active in the Robotyne area, receives up to 400 convicts per month to continue its offensive operations.\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3199\n\nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/3320\n\nOverall, despite some misconceptions, the war has never been as intense as it is now. Since the final phase of the battle for Avdiivka, the war has entered its bloodiest phase ever. Far worse than the times of the Bakhmut campaign or the spring 2022 Donbas offensive. This is not because there's a single sector where a major portion of the losses are concentrated, like e.g. 18 months ago. But because it had never happened that there were so many hot sectors at once. Pokrovsk, which is the bloodiest. Chasiv Yar. Kurakhove. But also all the others, apart from Kamyanske and Huliaipole which are, relatively, the quietest. In May the Kharkiv sector was activated, which has now become a very high intensity sector; in June it was the turn of Toretsk. The Russian offensive pace is very, very high. But so are their losses. Goes without saying that the Ukrainians are also heavily affected by this, and logically their casualties are proportional to the intensity of the fighting, leading to the problems we know. But we are talking about Russia right now, which, as we have seen, is by no means in an optimal situation as far as manpower is concerned.\n\nLast year Russia managed to recruit around 35,000 men per month, and the losses were on average far lower. In fact, it's likely that 2024 will have +50% higher losses, for the Russians, compared to the last year. In 2023, the Russians were able to increase the size of their grouping in Ukraine every month because of that, finding manpower to staff new formations, created from scratch. In 2024, the situation is far worse. At the moment being, I don't consider it possible that Russia's net gain between recruits and irretrievable losses is more than a handful of thousand men per month. [Per Kofman](https://x.com/KofmanMichael/status/1815880938200686910), Russia has been recruting less than 30,000 men per month during this year, confirming the hypothesis that therefore these very large increases in bonuses are due to a declining amount of recruits colliding with increasing losses.\n\nNow, a legit question could be, will Putin order a new mobilization wave, or will he wait for a new emergency (if there will be one)? I don't know. As long as it works, maybe they will continue with contracts + bonuses. It's likely that the figures reached by the latters will give an upswing in the number of volunteers, at least in the short term. But in doing so, they are creating an expectation that the bonuses are going to grow more and more, prompting people to wait. What I can say is that if I were a pro-war adviser to Putin, I would advise him to carry out a mobilization wave in September, passing it off as something needed to \"relieve our heroes\" - i.e. those mobilized in the fall 2022, whose families are increasingly wondering on social media, but also in certain squares, when their loved ones will return home. In December Putin [said](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/12/14/putin-says-over-600k-russian-servicemen-in-ukraine-a83429) that out of the 300,000 initially mobilized men, there were still 244,000 in Ukraine. Let's say (randomly) that the real number today is 150,000 and pretending that no one wants to stay. Putin can say there are 210,000 mobilized left in Ukraine as of today and they have consequently to mobilize 210,000 men to replace them, which would then result in a net gain of 60,000 men. This would be very beneficial to the Russian Armed Forces while making the mobilization way more acceptable to the public. But again, I'm just saying. At the moment there is no indication that a new mobilization wave is planned.",
