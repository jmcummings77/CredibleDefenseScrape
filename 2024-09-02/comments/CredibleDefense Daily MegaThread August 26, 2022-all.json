You have to see it compared to the baseline (GDP without the trade agreement or in this case sanctions) after like 10-15 years or in the long run. The problem is that it's difficult to take that into account with the war (taxation, loss of labor force, higher political uncertainity). Same thing that Andrew Bailey said about measuring the impact of Brexit, its hard to say what percentage of that was a result of Brexit or unrelated global shocks(war, china lockdowns, supply chain, COVID, etc.).",

Would the hull void between the top and the bottom prevent the rocket from breaking through to the bottom? If they are able to punch holes in solid reinforced concrete, I would imagine they would make mincemeat of this, but what are the stats for GMRLS vs steel plates with some standoff? Would the hull void actually be worse, because it is a confined space?\n\nAlso, what happens if the barges are all linked together by steel cable I wonder. Would it be better, because they can support one another, or would they run the risk of pulling each other to the bottom? A single barge filled with water would have more than the total buoyancy of the void in an unfilled one, but if they are tightly bound enough a hole in the bottom might not actually start filling, since it is held up, and the long chain will have a greater total buoyancy.",

        "body": "Russia is trying to seek help from Iran to evade sanctions and get weapons.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/24/russia-iran-drones-sanctions/\n\n> Beware the emerging Tehran-Moscow alliance: Russia has begun using Iranian-made drones in the Ukraine war and Iran has offered to share its financial networks to help Russia evade sanctions, according to Western intelligence officials.\n\n> For Russia, struggling to maintain momentum in Ukraine after six months of brutal conflict, the new Iranian assistance could be a game changer, the intelligence officials warn. \u201cThis is not just a tactical alliance,\u201d explained one official. With China and India refusing to sell weapons to Russia, Iran could become an essential pipeline for weapons and money.\n\n>\u201cThey know all the tricks in the book,\u201d in terms of evading sanctions, the intelligence official said of Iran. Iran can tap its existing infrastructure network of shell companies and other financial institutions in this sanctions-busting campaign. Iranian financial aid for Russia would be even easier if sanctions against Tehran are lifted as part of a renewal of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the intelligence officials warned.\n\n> To bolster Russia\u2019s depleted weapons inventory, Iran has begun delivering \u201chundreds\u201d of suicide drones, according to the intelligence officials. These drones would probably be part of the \u201cShahed\u201d series, about the size of a U.S. Predator, which Iran has used successfully in Iraq and Syria.\n\n> U.S.-Iran tensions have been escalating sharply, even as the two countries appear to be nearing a deal to revive the nuclear agreement. Iranian-backed proxies staged a complex drone strike Aug. 15 on a U.S. base in al-Tanf, in southern Syria. No Americans were killed or wounded. But it was a bold attack, and the U.S. Central Command announced Tuesday that the United States had retaliated with \u201cprecision airstrikes\u201d on a base near Deir-ez-Zor used by groups associated with Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n>\u201cWe are going to protect our people and strike those responsible, including the IRGC, if they keep this up,\u201d a senior administration official said Wednesday\n\n> The Biden administration has been warning for more than a month about the danger that Iran would supply drones to Russia. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN on July 15 that Iran was \u201cpreparing to provide Russia with several hundred UAVs, including weapons-capable UAVs,\u201d and that a Russian delegation had examined a \u201cshowcase\u201d of drones at an Iranian airfield. Iran promptly assured Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister that the U.S. reports were false\n\n> The Russians have, in fact, been rushing to put the Iranian drones over the battlefield. \u201cDuring the last several weeks, Russian officials conducted training in Iran as part of the agreement for UAV transfers,\u201d an NSC spokeswoman told me Wednesday. She also noted that Russia this month had launched an Iranian \u201cKhayyam\u201d satellite, which has \u201csignificant spying capabilities.\u201d\n\n>To expand Russian-Iranian economic ties \u2014 and build a framework for evading sanctions \u2014 Russia has sent executives from Gazprom and other companies to Tehran, according to an article Tuesday in Politico. Iranian economic officials have also visited Moscow. \u201cUnder what traders call a \u2018swap\u2019 arrangement, Iran could import Russian crude to its northern Caspian coast and then sell equivalent amounts of crude on Russia\u2019s behalf in Iranian tankers leaving from the Persian Gulf,\u201d Politico noted.\n\n> The budding Moscow-Tehran alliance adds a new obstacle to renewing the 2015 nuclear agreement. U.S. officials remain convinced that its limits on Iranian enrichment of uranium would bolster the security of both the United States and Israel. But Tehran has demanded concessions, outside the framework of the agreement, that the Biden administration has so far refused to make.\n\n>The most important Iranian demand is that the United States press the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna to halt its investigation of undeclared nuclear sites. \u201cNo deal will be implemented before the IAEA Board of Governors PERMANENTLY closes the false accusations file,\u201d a spokesman for the Iranian negotiating team tweeted Tuesday.\n\n>IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi had said the day before that his agency wouldn\u2019t halt the probe unless Iran cooperated. \u201cGive us the necessary answers, people and places so we can clarify the many things needed for clarification,\u201d Grossi said.\n\n>The United States apparently isn\u2019t willing to budge on the IAEA investigation issue. \u201cWe have communicated to Iran, both in public and private, that it must answer the IAEA questions. ... Our position on that is not going to change,\u201d White House National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby said Wednesday.\n\n>Iran\u2019s other two demands also appear to be nonstarters. Tehran had asked Washington to remove the IRGC from its list of terrorist groups, but the Biden administration flatly refused. And the Iranians want assurance that a subsequent U.S. administration wouldn\u2019t withdraw from the deal, as President Donald Trump did. Biden obviously can\u2019t commit a subsequent president, and Congress wouldn\u2019t pass such a pledge.\n\n>Russia\u2019s drone deal with Iran is a sign of how serious Moscow\u2019s weapons-supply problems have become after six months of war in Ukraine. Intelligence officials say that Moscow was initially hesitant to reach out to Tehran, whose leaders it mistrusts and whose nuclear ambitions it has consistently opposed. Russia likes to think that it\u2019s a superpower that doesn\u2019t need help from a troublesome neighbor.\n\n>\u201cIt shows a lot of desperation on the Russians\u2019 part that they\u2019re dependent on the Iranians here,\u201d the senior administration official said.\n\n>Right now, struggling to match the flow of weapons from the United States and its NATO allies into Ukraine, Russia can\u2019t afford to be so picky. That serves a short-term need. But it puts Russia in an even more isolated and dangerous place.",

Our position on that is not going to change,\u201d White House National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby said Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Iran\u2019s other two demands also appear to be nonstarters. Tehran had asked Washington to remove the IRGC from its list of terrorist groups, but the Biden administration flatly refused. And the Iranians want assurance that a subsequent U.S. administration wouldn\u2019t withdraw from the deal, as President Donald Trump did. Biden obviously can\u2019t commit a subsequent president, and Congress wouldn\u2019t pass such a pledge.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s drone deal with Iran is a sign of how serious Moscow\u2019s weapons-supply problems have become after six months of war in Ukraine. Intelligence officials say that Moscow was initially hesitant to reach out to Tehran, whose leaders it mistrusts and whose nuclear ambitions it has consistently opposed. Russia likes to think that it\u2019s a superpower that doesn\u2019t need help from a troublesome neighbor.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt shows a lot of desperation on the Russians\u2019 part that they\u2019re dependent on the Iranians here,\u201d the senior administration official said.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, struggling to match the flow of weapons from the United States and its NATO allies into Ukraine, Russia can\u2019t afford to be so picky. That serves a short-term need. But it puts Russia in an even more isolated and dangerous place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The accounts heavily criticized Russia in particular for the deaths of innocent civilians and other atrocities its soldiers committed in pursuit of the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cimperial ambitions\u201d following its invasion of Ukraine in February this year. A portion of the activity also promoted anti-extremism messaging.\n\nQuite interesting. Is this the turning point where we stop pretending that 'hybrid warfare' is some unique thing that 'the bad guys' do?\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nE: Some examples\n\n- One example was a tweet from March 11, 2022, which claimed that\nrelatives of deceased Afghan refugees had reported bodies being returned from\nIran with missing organs\n\n- Another anti-Iranian narrative claimed in late 2021 and early 2022 that the IRGC\nwas forcing Afghan refugees to join militias fighting in Syria and Yemen and that\nthose who refused were being deported\n\n- The Shorts were captioned in Pashto, English, and Urdu and\ncommented that \u201cThere is no difference between IRGC and ISIS\u201d and \u201cPeople\nlooting shops in Iran, but the Iranian government is still interfering in other\ncountries.\u201d\n\n- Beginning in February this\nyear, these accounts tailored content to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and designed\nanti-Russian messaging to appeal to Arabic-speaking audiences in the Middle\nEast. In addition to reports of Russian soldiers killing civilians, the accounts\namplified the narrative that Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to induce\na global food crisis that would hit less economically developed countries the\nhardest\n\n- Accounts also criticized the Quds Force\u2019s activities abroad and particularly its\nformer leader Soleimani, calling him a murderer and saying that his values were\ninconsistent with Islam. The tweet in Figure 36 is from just after the Taliban\nseized control of Afghanistan in 2021. It says that Quds Force personnel were\npretending to be journalists and going to Afghanistan to squash the country\u2019s\nopposition.\n\n- These accounts\u2014a fake persona and sham media outlet\u2014mainly\nfocused on the genocide of Uighurs and Muslim minorities in \u201cre-education\u201d\ncamps in Xinjiang. Posts described alleged organ trafficking, forced labor, sexual\ncrimes against Muslim women, and suspicious disappearances of ethnic Muslims\nin Xinjiang. The assets also posted about the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP)\npoor treatment of women\n\n- Other assets in the group also posted about China but asserted that Chinese\nauthoritarianism and financial imperialism threatened Central Asia and other\nregions of the world. The assets frequently referred to China\u2019s cooperation with\nRussia, especially on military issues, and said Beijing should be held responsible\nfor Russia\u2019s invasion ofUkraine because the CCP had secretly supplied the Kremlin\nwith weapons\n\n- Assets in the group heavily promoted narratives supportive of the U.S. on\nFacebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram. These posts primarily\nfocused on U.S. support for Central Asian countries and their people, presenting\nWashington as a reliable economic partner that would curb the region\u2019s\ndependence on Russia. Other posts argued that the U.S. was the main guarantor\nof Central Asia\u2019s sovereignty against Russia, frequently citing the war in Ukraine\nas evidence of the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cimperial\u201d ambitions. Interestingly, the assets also\npromoted U.S. humanitarian efforts, mentioning the United States Agency for\nInternational Development 94 times on Twitter and 384 times on Facebook in\nthe respective datasets.\n\n[The Iranian Octopus](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/805436493438779464/1013044843330670664/unknown.png)",

Is this the turning point where we stop pretending that &#39;hybrid warfare&#39; is some unique thing that &#39;the bad guys&#39; do?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>E: Some examples</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>One example was a tweet from March 11, 2022, which claimed that\nrelatives of deceased Afghan refugees had reported bodies being returned from\nIran with missing organs</p></li>\n<li><p>Another anti-Iranian narrative claimed in late 2021 and early 2022 that the IRGC\nwas forcing Afghan refugees to join militias fighting in Syria and Yemen and that\nthose who refused were being deported</p></li>\n<li><p>The Shorts were captioned in Pashto, English, and Urdu and\ncommented that \u201cThere is no difference between IRGC and ISIS\u201d and \u201cPeople\nlooting shops in Iran, but the Iranian government is still interfering in other\ncountries.\u201d</p></li>\n<li><p>Beginning in February this\nyear, these accounts tailored content to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and designed\nanti-Russian messaging to appeal to Arabic-speaking audiences in the Middle\nEast. In addition to reports of Russian soldiers killing civilians, the accounts\namplified the narrative that Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to induce\na global food crisis that would hit less economically developed countries the\nhardest</p></li>\n<li><p>Accounts also criticized the Quds Force\u2019s activities abroad and particularly its\nformer leader Soleimani, calling him a murderer and saying that his values were\ninconsistent with Islam. The tweet in Figure 36 is from just after the Taliban\nseized control of Afghanistan in 2021. It says that Quds Force personnel were\npretending to be journalists and going to Afghanistan to squash the country\u2019s\nopposition.</p></li>\n<li><p>These accounts\u2014a fake persona and sham media outlet\u2014mainly\nfocused on the genocide of Uighurs and Muslim minorities in \u201cre-education\u201d\ncamps in Xinjiang. Posts described alleged organ trafficking, forced labor, sexual\ncrimes against Muslim women, and suspicious disappearances of ethnic Muslims\nin Xinjiang. The assets also posted about the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP)\npoor treatment of women</p></li>\n<li><p>Other assets in the group also posted about China but asserted that Chinese\nauthoritarianism and financial imperialism threatened Central Asia and other\nregions of the world. The assets frequently referred to China\u2019s cooperation with\nRussia, especially on military issues, and said Beijing should be held responsible\nfor Russia\u2019s invasion ofUkraine because the CCP had secretly supplied the Kremlin\nwith weapons</p></li>\n<li><p>Assets in the group heavily promoted narratives supportive of the U.S. on\nFacebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram. These posts primarily\nfocused on U.S. support for Central Asian countries and their people, presenting\nWashington as a reliable economic partner that would curb the region\u2019s\ndependence on Russia. Other posts argued that the U.S. was the main guarantor\nof Central Asia\u2019s sovereignty against Russia, frequently citing the war in Ukraine\nas evidence of the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cimperial\u201d ambitions. Interestingly, the assets also\npromoted U.S. humanitarian efforts, mentioning the United States Agency for\nInternational Development 94 times on Twitter and 384 times on Facebook in\nthe respective datasets.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/805436493438779464/1013044843330670664/unknown.png\">The Iranian Octopus</a></p>\n</div>",

Elaborating on the reasons for a particular event allows recipients to form a mental model that can later bias processing of new information and make undercutting the initial belief difficult (Hart et al., 2009). Therefore, the media and policymakers should report about an incident of misinformation (e.g., a retraction report) in ways that reduce detailed thoughts in support of the misinformation.\n\n>Recommendation 2: create conditions that facilitate scrutiny and counterarguing of misinformation Our findings highlight the conclusion that counter-arguing the misinformation enhances the power of corrective efforts. Therefore, public mechanisms and educational initiatives should induce a state of healthy skepticism. Furthermore, when retractions or corrections are issued, facilitating understanding and generation of detailed coun-terarguments should yield optimal acceptance of the de-bunking message.\n\n>Recommendation 3: correct misinformation with new detailed information but keep expectations low The moderator analyses indicated that recipients of misinformation are less likely to accept the debunking messages when the countermessages simply label the misinformation as wrong rather than when they debunk the misinformation with new details (e.g., Thorson, 2013). A caveat is that the ultimate persistence of the misinformation depends on how it is initially perceived, and detailed debunking may not always function as expected.\n\nI wanted to next take a look at some of the examples he cites as examples of misinformation presented as debunking misinformation, one of which is an article he wrote published by RT, and I literally cannot find it in the [US State Department report on the subject of intentional Russian disinformation regarding Ukraine](https://www.state.gov/report-rt-and-sputniks-role-in-russias-disinformation-and-propaganda-ecosystem/) so I can't verify if the context he's presenting is accurate. I will say this report is well-argued and transparently sourced, unlike this Paul Robinson piece and the one he published in RT about Ukraine's Nazi problem.\n\nI've spent the last 45 minutes digging through this piece trying to substantiate his claims and only managed to get this far - I'd encourage someone else to examine the rest if they have some spare time. \n \nIronically Paul helps make one of the most convincing arguments as to why countering disinfo is so difficult - it takes just a few minutes to manufacture an easily digestible narrative, and it can take hours to properly debunk it.",

That may change in the future, but for the moment, he is popular.\n\nPopularity in a controlled media environment is irrelevant to the underlying moral argument. If they believed that their policies carry the mandate of the people they would not need to suppress any and all opposing views.
