Bellingcat and the BBC note that the craters and the videos shot around the time the explosion happened appear to be inconsistent with 500, 1000, 2000 lb bombs typically used in JDAM's. Instead the synthesis between these two articles point out that:\n\n1. People were tightly packed inside and outside the hospital, notably in the courtyard where the events mainly took place.\n   1. [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/17/israel-hamas-gaza-hospital-anglican-church/) states that the hospital has 80 beds, and typically handles 300 surgeries and 3500 outpatient visits a month.\n   2. With the conflict raging in Gaza, the BBC quoting the Anglican dean in Jerusalem, that the hospital was sheltering 1000 people in the courtyard, with further 600 staff and patients inside during the time of the explosion.\n   3. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-10-2023-who-statement-on-attack-on-al-ahli-arab-hospital-and-reported-large-scale-casualties) reported the hospital was operating when the attack occured.\n2. The crater and video of the explosion appears to be inconsistent with the type of bombs used by the JDAM.\n   1. From Bellingcat:\n      1. Marc Garlasco, a Military Advisor at PAX for Peace\u2019s Protection of Civilians team, the impact point does not appear to be consistent with the 500, 1000 or 2000-pound bombs used in Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs).\n   2. From the BBC:\n      1. J Andres Gannon, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, in the US, says the explosion appears to be small, meaning that the heat generated from the impact may have been caused by leftover rocket fuel rather than an explosion from a warhead.\n      2. Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in the UK, agrees. While it is difficult to be sure at such an early stage, he says, the evidence looks like the explosion was caused by a failed rocket section hitting the car park and causing a fuel and propellant fire.\n   3. ~~Separately the~~ [~~Episcopal/Anglican Church~~](https://afedj.org/ahli-hospital-struck-by-rocket-fire/) ~~in the area states that the strike struck the hospitals two uppermost floors, causing four nurses to be injured.~~\n      1. Edit: That particular strike was on Oct. 14 not the recent attack, and was attributed to Israeli rockets. That is my own error.\n\nThe obvious disclaimer should be that this is hardly definitive, both articles note that much more work is undergoing and events are still ongoing. Notably neither reports outright points fingers at either the IDF or the PIJ/Hamas, though the current evidence increasingly leans on the IDF not being behind this attack; at least it seems the hospital was not bombed. Interestingly the BBC notes that missile fragments are missing and not present when they sent their reporter onto the grounds.\n\nEdit: For grammar, clarity and accuracy.",

And when the truth eventually comes out (we <strong>still</strong> dont know enough), it won&#39;t change the opinion of someone who doesn&#39;t want to believe it.</p>\n\n<p>Defending the amorphous concept of the media is not really common, because it&#39;s pretty easy to shit on them, but I find a lot of the comments on Reddit to be lazy and making a bigger deal than necessary.</p>\n</div>",

Bibek wanted to return to his mother successful, and now he calls Putin Hitler.</p>\n\n<p>Nepalese people flocked to the Russian army for contract work after Russia simplified access to citizenship after a year of military service in May. Some left the Nepalese army for this purpose. It is not necessary to know Russian - English is enough.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

He thinks the next few weeks might feature some interesting developments still, but didn't clarify what that means exactly. \n\n* Kofman says that Russia is already acting as if they believe the Ukrainian offensive has culminated, their attack at Avdiivka is an attempt to retake the initiative from Ukraine. \n\n* While many are comparing the attack to Vuhledar, Kofman thinks it's more similar to what we saw the Russians attempting in Spring 2022 -> it was an ambitious attack featuring a large mechanized force attempting a localized breakthrough. Russians scraped together many subunits into task-oriented company tactical groups. The attack still failed, showing that Russia is struggling to rebuild offensive potential, but also shows that Russia is learning and adapting. Russia needs another round of mobilization to rebuild this offensive potential. \n\n* Kofman sees it as evidence that maneuver operations are much harder to pull off in this war than many Western commentators and analysts think. He expects that if Ukraine had tried to mass more units for its offensive in the South after the initial failures, the outcome would've looked like this -> high losses in men and materiel for minimal gains. \n\n* Kofman thinks its telling that the Russians launched such a major attack and suffered so many losses. It suggests that the Russians have more reserves than many have claimed in recent months, and that they're confident in their ability to keep holding Ukrainian offensive at bay. \n\n* As he's said previously, he thinks it's really important for Ukraine to maintain pressure on Russia over the Winter to prevent them from resting and rebuilding offensive potential, and retaking the initiative. \n\n[Active Ukrainian servicemember Kriegsforcher shared a brief thread showing previously unseen heavy Russian losses around the slag heap.](https://twitter.com/OSINTua/status/1714604462159835285?t=VzoqxiTovJabxPDL4I50MA&s=19) In the comments he also notes that most Russian losses were from ATGMs and artillery, not mines. \n\n[Finnish analyst Emil Kastehelmi posted a thread discussing the Russian attack at Avdiivka.](https://twitter.com/emilkastehelmi/status/1714715790153248909?t=ZO1r9iCTZp_Ur14s9dn5vQ&s=19) It's a good overview of the action, why it's important, and what it says about Russian forces. His takeaways are very similar to Kofman's: \n\n>Russia proved two things. It tried to take the initiative in a relatively fresh direction. Secondly, it still has reserves to do it, even though many have claimed the opposite.\n\n>Even though it seems Russians have learned some lessions from previous offensives, for example from Vuhledar, the tactical outcome of the offensive in Avdiivka was still a failure.

He expects that if Ukraine had tried to mass more units for its offensive in the South after the initial failures, the outcome would've looked like this -> high losses in men and materiel for minimal gains. \n\nThis seems to be more pointed at a precise criticism Kofman and Watling both brought up recently on his Russia Contingency podcast, though I don't know what the source is:\n\nAnonymous western defense officials supposedly said that the UAF quit too early in the June-July attacks, were casualty averse, and should have kept attacking with more forces to press the attack and achieve the breakthrough. Supposedly, the wargaming simulations that DOD ran to help UF GenStab with planning forecasted the breaching operations would take heavy losses but would need to keep the pressure to achieve a breakthrough. Instead, after the UAF took heavy casualties the units stopped attacking, for weeks or totally, and changed tactics from company sized combined arms breaches to small unit dismounted attacks.\n\nWatling's counter on the RC podcast was that the Ukrainian battalions only have around two platoons that are actually offensively capable (out of approx nine), so if their commander keeps up the pressure and take the losses they'd lose their offensive capability afterwards. \n\nNow Kofman is trying to use Russian bungling at Avdiivka as another reason the US was wrong. \n\nBut, I don't buy either argument.\n\nFirst, Watling's counter falls apart when considering most of those two platoons per battalion of offensively capable troops would be casualties in the first month, almost assuredly after four months. By saving them when it was still theoretically possible for an early breakthrough, by the time they recorded the podcasts there is no way those units didn't since have a major turnover in personnel, not for the better (elements of the 47th just mutinied because they're being pressing specialized infantry and other combat arms and support troops into makeshift infantry, not a good sign their replacement system is keeping up with losses). \n\nFor Kofman's recent claim, I don't buy it because I don't think the Russians actually massed that much forces at Avdiivka for each assault axis. Based on what Larelli posted yesterday describing units and different axes, the Russians attacked along something like a half dozen or more different tactical locations on both sides of the salient and all around it. At the shoulders, the salient point, around the corners, etc. So more broad front. But they also supposedly had elements from the same regiments supposedly involved in attacks on 2-3 locations each, which means only a battalion or less at each specific attack point, likely company level operations. So still dispersed.  \n\nMassed doesn't just mean lots in an overall sector attacking at once on line, it also means echeloned. Deep. Waves. \n\nI'm not trying to say the Ukrainians or Russians would have succeeded had they done that. But the better argument as to why they shouldn't follow DOD advice would be that they'd be reinforcing failure due to a highly flawed plan. \n\nBut let's be real, while they can say that about the Russians they can't say that much at all about the Ukrainians without getting wrecked on social media and potentially burning their relationships with the Ukrainian govt and MOD, who they require to do their job. AFAIK, Watling never outright criticizes UAF generaling. Kofman has done it a few times but only in situations where it was pretty obvious they'd screwed up, where it was already a pretty controversial and highly talked about subject among the Ukrainians too, including public social media infighting (like Bakhmut). If any credible OSINT analysts starts taking a crap on Tarnavsky or Zaluzhny, they're going to get blacklisted.

                "body": "> Anonymous western defense officials supposedly said that the UAF quit too early in the June-July attacks, were casualty averse, and should have kept attacking with more forces to press the attack and achieve the breakthrough. Supposedly, the wargaming simulations that DOD ran to help UF GenStab with planning forecasted the breaching operations would take heavy losses but would need to keep the pressure to achieve a breakthrough. Instead, after the UAF took heavy casualties the units stopped attacking, for weeks or totally, and changed tactics from company sized combined arms breaches to small unit dismounted attacks.\n\nFrom the Perun video he breaks down which units were brought into the fight and the above text isn't accurate if what Perun said is true.  Ukraine was on the verge of a breakthrough but Russia committed a unit sitting in reserve that is normally used for harder offensive operations.  When Russia did this, Ukraine then did the same.\n\nRussia became focused on not losing territory (and at times fighting before their heavily fortified lines) and Ukraine switched to fighting for territory that gave them a tactical advantage and otherwise fighting a war of attrition.  In order to make gains from attrition you have to keep pressure while you hammer the logistics in the rear.\n\nSo there had been some data I had seen about equipment losses of Russia vs Ukraine and despite being \"on the offensive\" Russia was losing more (I don't think the fights around Kupiansk were to blame for the disparity).  I would suspect the casualty ratios would be similar for personnel.\n\nWith all that said Ukraine seems to have made the choice to not bet the house going all in for a massive push and instead learned from the battle of Bakhmut that small units moving with fire superiority can win the day.  If Ukraine had F16s, more AA, ATACMs, the glide bomb rockets I can't remember the acronym for, I suspect they would have been more willing.\n\nWhen you start an offensive/defensive/operation you have goals.  You then develop a plan to reach those goals.  When the battles start, that plan will have to change to reflect the realities on the field.  When that plan changes you might have to change your goals if those goals are now either unachievable or success endures a cost you cannot bear.\n\nLooking at the south, could you say if Ukraine lost most of its offensive fighting forces and equipment getting to Tokmak would that have been a strategic success?  The only way you could say that is if you know for certain that offensive fighting force and equipment can be replaced and you can hold the ground you have once you take it.  Ukraine is far too reliant on outside support to be able to really bet everything on an offensive that won't win the war.  Taking Tokmak won't end the occupation in Donetsk.  Verbove and Novapropovika are not the Alamo.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Anonymous western defense officials supposedly said that the UAF quit too early in the June-July attacks, were casualty averse, and should have kept attacking with more forces to press the attack and achieve the breakthrough. Supposedly, the wargaming simulations that DOD ran to help UF GenStab with planning forecasted the breaching operations would take heavy losses but would need to keep the pressure to achieve a breakthrough. Instead, after the UAF took heavy casualties the units stopped attacking, for weeks or totally, and changed tactics from company sized combined arms breaches to small unit dismounted attacks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the Perun video he breaks down which units were brought into the fight and the above text isn&#39;t accurate if what Perun said is true.  Ukraine was on the verge of a breakthrough but Russia committed a unit sitting in reserve that is normally used for harder offensive operations.  When Russia did this, Ukraine then did the same.</p>\n\n<p>Russia became focused on not losing territory (and at times fighting before their heavily fortified lines) and Ukraine switched to fighting for territory that gave them a tactical advantage and otherwise fighting a war of attrition.  In order to make gains from attrition you have to keep pressure while you hammer the logistics in the rear.</p>\n\n<p>So there had been some data I had seen about equipment losses of Russia vs Ukraine and despite being &quot;on the offensive&quot; Russia was losing more (I don&#39;t think the fights around Kupiansk were to blame for the disparity).  I would suspect the casualty ratios would be similar for personnel.</p>\n\n<p>With all that said Ukraine seems to have made the choice to not bet the house going all in for a massive push and instead learned from the battle of Bakhmut that small units moving with fire superiority can win the day.  If Ukraine had F16s, more AA, ATACMs, the glide bomb rockets I can&#39;t remember the acronym for, I suspect they would have been more willing.</p>\n\n<p>When you start an offensive/defensive/operation you have goals.  You then develop a plan to reach those goals.  When the battles start, that plan will have to change to reflect the realities on the field.  When that plan changes you might have to change your goals if those goals are now either unachievable or success endures a cost you cannot bear.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the south, could you say if Ukraine lost most of its offensive fighting forces and equipment getting to Tokmak would that have been a strategic success?

This was his exact quote: \"I think maneuver is grossly overestimated, and are very optimistic about the ability to achieve breakthroughs against a well prepared defense, and this war consistently shows that to be a problem\".\n\nIt was literally in the episode of the Kofman and Watling's Russian Contingency podcast episode of \"Fires And Observation: A Conversation With Jack Watling.\" \n\nBoth Kofman and Watling spoke about Western criticisms about the offensive (which I don't agree with either, BTW) and how they felt the criticisms weren't warranted and were harmful, with Kofman specifically saying the claim of casualty aversion was unfounded, which then caused Watling to bring up the astonishing admittance that only two platoons in a whole UAF battalion are offensive capable (which I also don't fully buy, I think it's unit dependent).. \n\n>If anything it's connected to his and Watling's theories in the same podcast episode that NATO does not know how to breach Russian lines at the scale we see in Ukraine, because that was never gonna be a situation NATO would end up in while defending Europe. \n\nWatling brings up a \"NATO doctrine\" for breakthroughs and says it's based on 80s era motor rifle division on the pause defenses. \n\nFirst, that's just stupid because every NATO military is different and definitely didn't ever follow the same doctrine. US were different than UK and Germans, let alone everyone else. \n\nSecond, Ukraine has had since November when they started pitching this offensive to plan for it and didn't. Nobody should get pissy about NATO not knowing what it's doing when the Ukrainians didn't even know most of the Russian defenses even existed because they didn't do any recon. \n\nF'ing 9th Corps didn't even legitimately train for the offensive but NATO doesn't know what it's doing. Yeah right..\n\n>We would counter-attack advancing formations of the Soviet army, but breaching heavily prepared and defended lines at the scale we see in Ukraine where never in the cards. We never trained for it and didn't really develop doctrine for it. \n\nYeah, we developed MICLIC, multiple generations of engineer vehicles based on tank chassis, and had one mine plow ready to be issued to every platoon, and were doing combined arms breaching FTX routinely since the early 80s at NTC but we didn't really develop doctrine...\n\nJust because I know you're full of it I did a quick Google search to find the first old manual, aka doctrine, to prove you wrong: \n\nFM 90-13-1, Combined Arms Breaching Operations, dated **28 February 1991** with a chapter labeled \"Deliberate Breaching\" that says this, \"The Soviets\u2019 rapidly placed minefield consists of\rthree or four 200- to 300-meter-long rows spaced 20 to 40\rmeters apart with mines spaced to 6 meters apart. As a rule,\rthe minefield covers the depth of a football field. Table A-l\rgives more details on the dimensions of. the standard Soviet\rAT and AP minefields.\"\n\nIt's not surprising you didn't know that. But it's also not surprising Watling didn't know either. Why do I believe that? \n\n[This is his doctoral thesis, from 2018](https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/id/eprint/40372/) \"Attitudes towards civil war among British officials, 1900-1924\"\n\nFun fact, my BA history capstone paper was on breaching operations in the second battle of Fallujah. \n\nI'm sure Watling learned a bunch more since 2018, but armored warfare obviously isn't his forte, especially since it would never have come up in his academic studies or profession until this war started. And he obviously didn't learn much in this war, his analysis is pretty clearly written by someone who can write very well especially using popular defense jargon (and wow he's a really good public speaker), but he definitely isn't a subject matter expert either on this topic either. \n\nKofman is way better, much more experienced, but even he's more a generalist about the Russian defense system, not an actual ground warfare expert who gets into the weeds about tactics and doctrine.  \n\n>Him and Watling gave examples from Orihiv where Ukrainian company sized formations had to have up to 3km combat width to avoid being rendered combat ineffective from russian fires\n\nWatling has been saying that since the start of the war, it was literally in his first report. And many many many previous campaigns in this war show its bunk. There is no way in hell they had one platoon per kilometer (that's about 36 men per 1000 meters) and held the line anywhere defensively. And they definitely didn't do that offensively. Go look up any of these maps, [this one](https://militaryland.net/maps/deployment-map/) or [this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8tPY8wWMAAzzkS?format=jpg&name=large), and look how many brigades they have crammed in that salient.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>No, it was general remark by Kofman. This was his exact quote: &quot;I think maneuver is grossly overestimated, and are very optimistic about the ability to achieve breakthroughs against a well prepared defense, and this war consistently shows that to be a problem&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was literally in the episode of the Kofman and Watling&#39;s Russian Contingency podcast episode of &quot;Fires And Observation: A Conversation With Jack Watling.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Both Kofman and Watling spoke about Western criticisms about the offensive (which I don&#39;t agree with either, BTW) and how they felt the criticisms weren&#39;t warranted and were harmful, with Kofman specifically saying the claim of casualty aversion was unfounded, which then caused Watling to bring up the astonishing admittance that only two platoons in a whole UAF battalion are offensive capable (which I also don&#39;t fully buy, I think it&#39;s unit dependent).. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If anything it&#39;s connected to his and Watling&#39;s theories in the same podcast episode that NATO does not know how to breach Russian lines at the scale we see in Ukraine, because that was never gonna be a situation NATO would end up in while defending Europe. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Watling brings up a &quot;NATO doctrine&quot; for breakthroughs and says it&#39;s based on 80s era motor rifle division on the pause defenses. </p>\n\n<p>First, that&#39;s just stupid because every NATO military is different and definitely didn&#39;t ever follow the same doctrine. US were different than UK and Germans, let alone everyone else. </p>\n\n<p>Second, Ukraine has had since November when they started pitching this offensive to plan for it and didn&#39;t. Nobody should get pissy about NATO not knowing what it&#39;s doing when the Ukrainians didn&#39;t even know most of the Russian defenses even existed because they didn&#39;t do any recon. </p>\n\n<p>F&#39;ing 9th Corps didn&#39;t even legitimately train for the offensive but NATO doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s doing. Yeah right..</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We would counter-attack advancing formations of the Soviet army, but breaching heavily prepared and defended lines at the scale we see in Ukraine where never in the cards. We never trained for it and didn&#39;t really develop doctrine for it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, we developed MICLIC, multiple generations of engineer vehicles based on tank chassis, and had one mine plow ready to be issued to every platoon, and were doing combined arms breaching FTX routinely since the early 80s at NTC but we didn&#39;t really develop doctrine...</p>\n\n<p>Just because I know you&#39;re full of it I did a quick Google search to find the first old manual, aka doctrine, to prove you wrong: </p>\n\n<p>FM 90-13-1, Combined Arms Breaching Operations, dated <strong>28 February 1991</strong> with a chapter labeled &quot;Deliberate Breaching&quot; that says this, &quot;The Soviets\u2019 rapidly placed minefield consists of\nthree or four 200- to 300-meter-long rows spaced 20 to 40\nmeters apart with mines spaced to 6 meters apart. As a rule,\nthe minefield covers the depth of a football field. Table A-l\ngives more details on the dimensions of. the standard Soviet\nAT and AP minefields.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not surprising you didn&#39;t know that. But it&#39;s also not surprising Watling didn&#39;t know either. Why do I believe that? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/id/eprint/40372/\">This is his doctoral thesis, from 2018</a> &quot;Attitudes towards civil war among British officials, 1900-1924&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact, my BA history capstone paper was on breaching operations in the second battle of Fallujah. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure Watling learned a bunch more since 2018, but armored warfare obviously isn&#39;t his forte, especially since it would never have come up in his academic studies or profession until this war started. And he obviously didn&#39;t learn much in this war, his analysis is pretty clearly written by someone who can write very well especially using popular defense jargon (and wow he&#39;s a really good public speaker), but he definitely isn&#39;t a subject matter expert either on this topic either. </p>\n\n<p>Kofman is way better, much more experienced, but even he&#39;s more a generalist about the Russian defense system, not an actual ground warfare expert who gets into the weeds about tactics and doctrine.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Him and Watling gave examples from Orihiv where Ukrainian company sized formations had to have up to 3km combat width to avoid being rendered combat ineffective from russian fires</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Watling has been saying that since the start of the war, it was literally in his first report. And many many many previous campaigns in this war show its bunk. There is no way in hell they had one platoon per kilometer (that&#39;s about 36 men per 1000 meters) and held the line anywhere defensively. And they definitely didn&#39;t do that offensively. Go look up any of these maps, <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/maps/deployment-map/\">this one</a> or <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8tPY8wWMAAzzkS?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">this one</a>, and look how many brigades they have crammed in that salient.

Where Ukraine are stuck now you have no less than the equivalent of a russian brigade able to put direct fires on any Ukrainian breaching attempt.\n\nIt's FM 3-34.2, not .1.\n\nAs for scale, the manual is meant for battalion and brigade level operations, since they are the ones who execute the breaching operations. Did you think they'd write separate manuals on combined arms breach ops from the viewpoint of a corps, then another from the viewpoint of a division, and then finally one for BCT level operations? Nope, that's not how it works. Divisions and higher already know their role in those ops because nothing really changes for them, it's just supporting an attack providing C4I, logistics and other support during those operations. \n\nSame goes for Urban Operations manual too, which also focuses on battalion-brigade level, despite all being able to scale up because many urban ops are division sized or higher. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>No, i think Kofman's argument is that it's the attacker that suffers unsustainable losses when they mass without being able to suppress the defenders weapons and optics. Hyperbole nonsense, again.\n\nThis is the problem with generalist, they don't understand that massing doesn't just mean assault units, it means everyone involved in the attack.\n\nFor instance, one can \"mass fires,\" by cramming the AO with as many tubes and rockets and everything else so in a very short period they can throw maximum weight downrange. Ukraine has something like ten separate artillery brigades, most are in the East, not supporting their strategic main effort. That's not massing.\n\nWhen it comes to massing, defenders can do that too. When Ukraine started the offensive off around Orikhiv they had only two brigades attacking, they now have something like 8-10 in that sector. At what point could Russian defenders more easily mass resources to stop an attack? When it was only two brigades attacking them (each with only 2 companies per brigade attacking at once, as reported by Kofman)? Or when elements from two full corps were all attacking together?\n\nKofman's overall argument was developed months ago back in July when he first started blaming the West. Suggesting the UAF were pushed into doing a maneuver warfare centric combined arms breach for this offensive by NATO, trying to press their mode of fighting on the UAF, who prefer slow, fires driven incremental advances. Kofman repeatedly said this in multiple podcasts, that the US in particular tries to shoehorn its mode of fighting on others when we need to just accept their own way and support that.\n\nThat opinion is very problematic for many reasons. One, while NATO surely promoted their way of warfare during the training they provided, the UAF were already focusing on mechanized combined arms breaching operations and maneuver warfare all through their counteroffensives in 2022, they succeeded in Kharkiv twice doing them but failed while trying them twice in Kherson. How did NATO pressure them into a mode of warfare they already preferred?\n\nSecond, slow, incremental fires driven advances are too slow to be politically reliable (hence why the UAF Plan A was an attempt at a lightning breakthrough) and its extremely supply intensive, to the degree the West can't support them literally defeating the Russians by outshooting them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Almost as ridiculous as that they are limited to 2 offensive platoons per battalion\n\nWatling said that, after being traveling to Ukraine and visiting the front lines something like 4-5 times in this war so far.\n\nOr when Kofman recently said that only 2-3 companies per battalion could attack at any given time due to issues with command and control. I agree with you, these are probably untrue, at least in the sense that they aren't universal.\n\nI ripped on claims from Tom Cooper's blog for this about a year ago for doing the same thing (him claiming every UAF unit was using 80% of their own drone flight time checking the camouflage of their own positions).\n\nI think many of these analysts are hearing anecdotes relating to specific units in specific locations, situations and times, and applying those anecdotes to the larger force structure as if they are sharing SOPs, despite the UAF being pretty well known for its lack of standardization.\n\nThe problem is these analysts are pretty much the only ones talking about the UAF at the tactical level besides a very few revolutions from their troops breaking OPSEC. If we're kept in the dark and fed only horse crap, the analysis isn't going to be good. And yet there is enough leaking out to suggest things aren't going well with the UAF, which isn't surprising since they have over a million troops under arms and most are barely trained for the roles they are supposed to perform.",

I agree with you, these are probably untrue, at least in the sense that they aren&#39;t universal.</p>\n\n<p>I ripped on claims from Tom Cooper&#39;s blog for this about a year ago for doing the same thing (him claiming every UAF unit was using 80% of their own drone flight time checking the camouflage of their own positions).</p>\n\n<p>I think many of these analysts are hearing anecdotes relating to specific units in specific locations, situations and times, and applying those anecdotes to the larger force structure as if they are sharing SOPs, despite the UAF being pretty well known for its lack of standardization.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is these analysts are pretty much the only ones talking about the UAF at the tactical level besides a very few revolutions from their troops breaking OPSEC. If we&#39;re kept in the dark and fed only horse crap, the analysis isn&#39;t going to be good. And yet there is enough leaking out to suggest things aren&#39;t going well with the UAF, which isn&#39;t surprising since they have over a million troops under arms and most are barely trained for the roles they are supposed to perform.</p>\n</div>",

But while he said he understood the \u201call consuming rage,\u201d and said it was much like that Americans felt more than two decades ago, he warned against making the same mistakes that the United States did by letting it drive bad decisions.

If you can't come up with those, don't, or you'll likely regret it just like we did with Afghanistan and Iraq.\"\n\nIn short, he's trying to talk them out of an unfocused ground invasion with unobtainable broad objectives like \"destroy Hamas once and for all\" that will almost certainly not achieve a productive political/security result for the Israelis.\n\nRelated NYT: [Biden Pledged Solidarity in His Visit to Israel.

But I caution this \u2014 while you feel that rage, don\u2019t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Biden did not elaborate, but he presumably was referring to the invasion of Iraq, which he voted for as a senator and later came to regret. Nor did he explain what he meant in Israel\u2019s case, but the meaning was clear enough. As Israel seeks to destroy Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people and took nearly 200 hostages, his message was that it should not give into excesses that cause unnecessary loss of innocent life \u2014 and in the process, squander the world\u2019s sympathy the way the United States eventually did two decades ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

That's a century old tactic that is a key requirement for successfully offensive ops, especially when visual spotting of assaulting units is what's leading to them getting hit. If the defender can't see, they especially can't use precision fires.\n\nSmoke is on an order of magnitude harder to pull off now since the drones in the air easily peek over standard type screens. Very deep and thick smoke screens require more smoke ammo than usually immediately available for either side.

Constant drone coverage, minus heavy EW use or bad weather, doesn't just screw with getting spotted during the approach march, breach and assault, the attacking AFV can't remain near the enemy objective afterwards unless they can disperse and all find clever concealment when they're parked and waiting between missions or part of a defense. If they're exposed, then the FPV or targeted arty goes after them. The only way to make it work just for an attack is to create a gap where the drones cant fly (EW or SHORAD) or can't see (obscuration, night). \n\nI think that's why dispersed infantry attacks are working so well in this war when they shouldn't. The forward line of friendly troops and forward line of enemy troops are often pretty close by. Both sides are in dug in trenches so even if they are spotted they're hard to successfully neutralize or destroy. It doesn't take too long to launch the attack, breach obstacles as fast as possible taking the risk (Watling says they probe for mines standing up to be faster), then close on the objective. If they take heavy fire, they retreat back to cover and concealment. If they take the objective they either take over existing cover and concealment occupying enemy positions or they quickly dig in. Being dispersed and small unit makes it harder for drones to spot them and enemy fires to hit them, and it allows the attacker to do it more often from many locations similar to swarm attacks. They're still taking frightful losses, but easier to plan, faster, less effective enemy weapon systems can hit them in the time they're out of cover and concealment, and afterwards they can disappear easier.\n\nFor a mechanized attack to work, they need to assemble and start the approach march from longer distances, breach and assault, then drop off dismounts to hold the objective against a counter attack as the AFV retreat to predesignated hide sites, all without getting spotted by drones, who direct in an the defensive fires (arty, FPV drones, ATGMs, helicopters, long range glide bombs, GMLRS, etc). \n\nThe only way to keep pressing forward with AFV is to continuously have successful TTPs to blind or down the drones. \n\nAnd that is the part that baffles me. They don't like using smoke or night, because it screws with their own C3. They don't push SHORAD up front.

If I was a European procurement official/officer in the current climate I would have the tried and true albeit more dated transport airframe I can have now over the potentially better airframe years from now which may have unforeseen issues and delays. Someone has to take the first adopter risk but I&#39;m not sure if that risk is justified on a transport for the countries of a politically warming European continent.</p>\n\n<p>(I promise I am not paid by Lockheed)</p>\n</div>",

I assume current training regime is still significantly longer than learning to fly a Mavic, but much shorter and less developed than what was the norm (here they say 2.5 to 4 months for people with piloting experience: https://www.techinsider[dot]ru/weapon/230301-kak-v-rossii-treniruyut-operatorov-voennykh-bespilotnikov/).\n\nSee: https://www.gazeta[dot]ru/army/2022/10/17/15625231.shtml",

Satellite imagery shows numerous choppers still near the impacted area, which likely indicates they've been damaged. How damaged they are will be difficult to ascertain, but it's clear that Russia's attack helicopter fleet was devastated by the five missiles launched. \n\nRussia will need to relocate its fleet. I believe the only realistic airfield in the South is in Dzhankoy, over 200 km from Ukrainian positions in the Tokmak direction. ~~With Ka-52 combat range being around 470 km, that is a pretty tight squeeze.

Satellite imagery shows numerous choppers still near the impacted area, which likely indicates they&#39;ve been damaged. How damaged they are will be difficult to ascertain, but it&#39;s clear that Russia&#39;s attack helicopter fleet was devastated by the five missiles launched. </p>\n\n<p>Russia will need to relocate its fleet. I believe the only realistic airfield in the South is in Dzhankoy, over 200 km from Ukrainian positions in the Tokmak direction. <del>With Ka-52 combat range being around 470 km, that is a pretty tight squeeze.

The video from Be'eri is like 9 in the morning.\n\nShould I find the video of Hamas terrorist entering a home and before he even clears it, he loots an ipad?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do I really need to explicitly type out that murder is bad?\n\nYes, you really do. Because thus far all you've done is made excuses for murderers. Only Palestinian ones, of course.\n\n>I'm not sure how you are so sure these \"ordinary civilians\" aren't also Hamas operatives, either. The video where the two guys with guns and body armour kill the person under the car shows them wearing normal clothes too. Either way,\n\nIt's bloody hell amazing that even now, after all these videos clearly show civilians, you still deny reality and try and make excuses that perhaps these are Hamas.\n\nHey genius. Hamas is on a murderous raid throughout Israeli territory would carry guns. Honestly, at this point this conversation is getting ridiculous.\n\nYou are truly living in your own little world where Hamas is only kinda sorta the bad guy, and \"innocent Gazan civilians\" are definitely all good people. Nothing I can say or do or link could prove to you otherwise.\n\nHopefully anyone else that seen the videos I linked can understand the things you won't. Gazan civilians willfully and gleefully participated the massacre and looting of 7/10. There's a couple dozen more at least of these types of videos.\n\nSo, **this is my last response in this thread to you**. You will never get it, and I won't try any further.",

But it's unlikely that Israel achieves all the theoretical goals it sets for itself. So they'll perform the ground invasion and from that point forward find the path of least resistance towards an objective while keeping the pulse of global, regional and national opinion.\n\nPersonally, I wonder if they aren't going to take another page out of older playbooks. We're already talking about a siege, so why not take inspiration from Haussmann? With much of Gaza destroyed already and more set to be destroyed during the invasion, Israel could occupy Gaza until reconstruction according to their future military needs, after which they'll maintain this layout from the air with air strikes on unsanctioned construction sites.\n\nClearly separate hospitals, schools and UN facilities from other buildings and house them in compounds at the edges of towns facing Israel. Separate areas of large urban sprawl with either very wide empty land or a fortified military access road for the IDF. Reshape the entire Gaza strip by strictly managing the Palestinian reconstruction. In the end, the IDF should have a much easier time conducting air strikes or a full invasion, special forces should have easier access and escape routes deep into Gaza and Hamas and other terrorists should be less able to use the urban sprawl and buildings of international interest to cover their own activities.",

So they&#39;ll perform the ground invasion and from that point forward find the path of least resistance towards an objective while keeping the pulse of global, regional and national opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I wonder if they aren&#39;t going to take another page out of older playbooks. We&#39;re already talking about a siege, so why not take inspiration from Haussmann? With much of Gaza destroyed already and more set to be destroyed during the invasion, Israel could occupy Gaza until reconstruction according to their future military needs, after which they&#39;ll maintain this layout from the air with air strikes on unsanctioned construction sites.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly separate hospitals, schools and UN facilities from other buildings and house them in compounds at the edges of towns facing Israel. Separate areas of large urban sprawl with either very wide empty land or a fortified military access road for the IDF. Reshape the entire Gaza strip by strictly managing the Palestinian reconstruction. In the end, the IDF should have a much easier time conducting air strikes or a full invasion, special forces should have easier access and escape routes deep into Gaza and Hamas and other terrorists should be less able to use the urban sprawl and buildings of international interest to cover their own activities.</p>\n</div>",

By the time they started seriously attacking it would be well into April, giving them about a month and a half until the Ukraine spring offensive season starts, which is going to largely wrap up their campaign because Wagner can't afford to be stuck in offensive posture if they get attacked in force (which is what Prigozhin repeatedly complained about).\n\nAnd those timelines don't consider Wagner needing to be relieved in place first around Bakhmut, then execute a RIP with another Russian formation wherever it moves to, with likely a few additional weeks of rest, relaxation, reconstitution in the rear areas before Wagner goes back into the fight. By the time they were ready to go on the offensive, they'd basically have maybe a few weeks before seriously expecting to receive a UAF counteroffensive.

By the time they started seriously attacking it would be well into April, giving them about a month and a half until the Ukraine spring offensive season starts, which is going to largely wrap up their campaign because Wagner can&#39;t afford to be stuck in offensive posture if they get attacked in force (which is what Prigozhin repeatedly complained about).</p>\n\n<p>And those timelines don&#39;t consider Wagner needing to be relieved in place first around Bakhmut, then execute a RIP with another Russian formation wherever it moves to, with likely a few additional weeks of rest, relaxation, reconstitution in the rear areas before Wagner goes back into the fight. By the time they were ready to go on the offensive, they&#39;d basically have maybe a few weeks before seriously expecting to receive a UAF counteroffensive. Which is definitely something Wagner wasn&#39;t set up for, they are an assault unit not meant to hold the line defensively.</p>\n</div>",

I was pretty shocked to learn that Iron Dome was something they were importing from the US, but it makes sense. Of course the big elephant in the room are the F- series fighters Israel has/wants to buy. I believe a big chunk of US-Israel military aid goes to keeping those birds in the sky and armed with the latest US weaponry. Israel would be hurt for some things, eg. F-15 parts which may be otherwise hard to come by or expensive to acquire. But realistically the US may stop subsidizing Israel (honestly even that is pretty unrealistic) but it will never cut off Israeli access to US companies like LockMart. So really were talking about overall cost increases, not total loss of access. It all would mean Israel has to start paying a significant amount more for its defense, probably raising taxes or increasing deficit spending to do so. It would also probably mean a transition in the next generation away from American products to European or domestic. Israel has already done this in other areas.\n\nThe problem with the 'cut them off' plan, well this isn't necessarily a problem for people on the left but we here would recognize this as a problem, is that the US benefits a great deal from its aid to Israel. Israel buys parts and systems the US likes, F-15s, -16s, -35s, advanced missiles, advanced sensors, and the like. Israel is likely to field test these weapons, one wonders if Israel's F-35s are right now seeing service. If so they would be, AFAIK, the first of the F-35s to fly combat sorties of any kind. So Israel buys things which help subsidize costs back to the US for its own platforms (particularly in unit cost sensitive acquisitions like the F-35) and they produce important performance data which can be returned for future projects. Israel also has a strong habit of customizing, or ordering to be customized, many of its aircraft giving the US and its contractors a window into 'alternate worlds.' Importantly Israel also plays a vital role in military R&D, they either push for very unique capabilities and so explore unusual technologies or configurations, OR they develop weapons to meet very specific requirements which later have broad applicability worldwide. Iron Dome, as one example, was revolutionary when it first deployed. The Merkva, as another example, is a pretty unique vehicle which turned a lot of heads in the 80s and 90s though ultimately it has not proven itself as unique in combat as its early proponents thought it would be. But all this is to say that the US-Israel relationship profits both. Of course those who oppose US military aid to Israel, I would guess, also oppose more generally the overall American defense budget and so would be gland and willing to sacrifice those knock on R&D investments and question the importance of current acquisition plans as well. I think that is short sighted, but they would I'm sure disagree.",

            "body": "Well   \n\n\nA. How do you know Biden didn't? He clearly tried to talk the Israelis around on humanitarian stuff, he's already got the water turned back on, so obviously he's trying to mitigate their anger somewhat. But he's also not the President of Israel and he can only go so far in what to say.  For example, imagine if Tony Blair had come to the US after 9/11 and tried to talk us down from invading Afghanistan. It's a political impossibility for him to go to an extreme length to try and force Israel to back down, so his options are limited. I don't think there's a bone in Biden's body that wants Palestinians to die, but unfortunately political realities are often harsh compared to what we would ideally like to see.   \n\n\nB. I would really encourage people, not just OP but pretty much everyone, to be careful in using the term genocide so as not to devalue it. For context, I spent all of my undergraduate and graduate research writing in no small part about genocide, so I feel comfortable making statements regarding the nature of it. What's happening so far in Gaza is \\*close\\* to the line imo. There is a definitive case for ethnic cleansing on the part of Israel right now, though that in and of itself is not specifically codified under international law. But it's just a case and it's not open and shut. Similarly, if Israel does launch a ground invasion of Gaza, I think it would be definitively hard to prove genocidal intent unless we see some very specific evidence. I do not think you will see IDF soldiers just shooting random Palestinian civilians in the street or committing mass rape or anything like that. That said, the Netanhayu government has made a number of statements over the years that cleave very close to (or fall entirely into) genocidal rhetoric.

He clearly tried to talk the Israelis around on humanitarian stuff, he&#39;s already got the water turned back on, so obviously he&#39;s trying to mitigate their anger somewhat. But he&#39;s also not the President of Israel and he can only go so far in what to say.  For example, imagine if Tony Blair had come to the US after 9/11 and tried to talk us down from invading Afghanistan. It&#39;s a political impossibility for him to go to an extreme length to try and force Israel to back down, so his options are limited. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a bone in Biden&#39;s body that wants Palestinians to die, but unfortunately political realities are often harsh compared to what we would ideally like to see.   </p>\n\n<p>B. I would really encourage people, not just OP but pretty much everyone, to be careful in using the term genocide so as not to devalue it. For context, I spent all of my undergraduate and graduate research writing in no small part about genocide, so I feel comfortable making statements regarding the nature of it. What&#39;s happening so far in Gaza is *close* to the line imo. There is a definitive case for ethnic cleansing on the part of Israel right now, though that in and of itself is not specifically codified under international law. But it&#39;s just a case and it&#39;s not open and shut. Similarly, if Israel does launch a ground invasion of Gaza, I think it would be definitively hard to prove genocidal intent unless we see some very specific evidence. I do not think you will see IDF soldiers just shooting random Palestinian civilians in the street or committing mass rape or anything like that. That said, the Netanhayu government has made a number of statements over the years that cleave very close to (or fall entirely into) genocidal rhetoric. Any ground invasion is something the international community will need to watch very closely.</p>\n</div>",
