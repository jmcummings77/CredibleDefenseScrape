Piro is an American of Lebanese origin who speaks fluent Arabic.\n\n> Bergen: How long were you with Saddam? And, of course, you\u2019re communicating in Arabic throughout, right?\n\n> Piro: About seven months. Initially, I would see him in the mornings. I would translate for his medical staff. And then, the formal interrogations were once or twice a week for several hours. As time went on, I started to spend more and more one-on-one time with him because I could communicate directly and very quickly with him. I built that to about five to seven hours every single day, one-on-one, a couple of hours in the morning, a couple of hours in the afternoon and then a formal interrogation session or two a week.\n\n> And we talked about everything. So especially in the first couple of months, my goal was just to get him to talk. I wanted to know what he valued in life and what his likes, dislikes and thought processes were. So we talked about everything from history, art, sports to politics. We would talk about things that I knew he wouldn\u2019t have any reservations or hesitations to talk about. [...]\n\n> Saddam told me that he didn\u2019t like Osama bin Laden and that he didn\u2019t believe in al Qaeda\u2019s ideology because it aimed to create an Islamic state throughout the Arab world. Well, Saddam had no desire to turn over power or relinquish anything to someone else. Saddam would joke about Osama bin Laden, saying, \u201cYou really can\u2019t trust anybody with a beard like that.\u201d",

He was recently on the [Carnegie Connects show with Aaron David Miller.](https://www.youtube.com/live/mMgsg9vbYxY?feature=share)\n\nThere's a lot in this interview that Kofman has covered elsewhere, so here are some of my takeaways from this discussion that seemed new or particularly important to me. \n\n* The battles going on all over Ukraine differ greatly from one another. The character of the fight for Bakhmut is quite different from the fight around Vuhledar, and both are themselves different from the fights around Avdiivka and Vuhledar. Knowing one battle means exactly that, you know one battle. \n\n\n* **The biggest problem facing Ukraine right now isn't equipment, but force quality.** Ukraine has lost most of its best trained troops and it hasn't done a great job with training replacements, and Western training has been quite small with mixed reviews according to Ukrainian troops. Kofman claims that **most Ukrainian troops are mobilized personnel who have *no previous military experience* at this point.**\n\n\n* Kofman once again listed what he sees as Ukraine's greatest needs in order: artillery ammunition and the replacement of artillery barrels, air defense munitions/platforms, and armored fighting vehicles most importantly IFVs and APCs. Ukraine has a lot of manpower, but it needs more protected mobility to be able to conduct offensives. He also noted the need for more drones/ISR as well as communications equipment for Ukraine. \n\n\n* When he was in Bakhmut he saw a reinforcing tank platoon that was composed entirely of T-80s that were captured in Izyum from the 1st Tank Guards army. He also noted that the problem for Ukraine is that it doesn't have enough replacement parts to keep running all of the Russian vehicles its captured. \n\n\n* Once again reemphasized that providing Western planes will take a long time for their effects to be felt and their effects won't be worthwhile compared with their cost. There's a limited amount of funding available for Ukraine and providing planes will consume a lot of those funds with no effects during the upcoming decisive period of the war. \n\n\n* Ukraine still has a positive casualty ratio against Russia around Bakhmut, but the ratio is worse now than its been previously. It's a fight that doesn't play to Ukraine's strengths. \n\n\n* **Kofman thinks the decisive period of the war will be in Spring-Summer of this year.** There is the possibility that this offensive will have the effect of altering the future trajectory of the conflict, especially if Ukraine is able to sever the Russian GLOC between Crimea and the Donbas. Kofman thinks that whatever happens at Bakhmut is unlikely to be important longterm, but Ukrainian offensive could have a major impact on Russia's ability to sustain the war and potentially even cause a breakdown of cohesion like what happened during Kharkiv (though he's caveats this as being less likely). This doesn't mean the war would be close to being over though, Russia is really the one who decides when the war ends. \n\n\n* The next few months will have the greatest intersection of Western military equipment assistance with Ukrainian will to succeed, and preparations for an offensive that could change the trajectory of the war. \n\n\n* The upcoming Ukrainian offensive will likely not be a single huge thrust in one direction, but a series of offensives in different directions. Might look more like Kherson where it was fought in phases or pulses. \n\n\n* A strategic defeat for Russia is not the same thing as a victory for Ukraine. One could argue Russia has already lost this war from a strategic perspective, but what happens from here shapes how the war will end for Ukraine. \n\n\nThis was a longer video (~45 min) and I highly recommend it. The host actually asks some excellent questions, including follow up questions, which get Kofman to open up a bit and elaborate on things he doesn't always cover. It's a pretty wide ranging interview and cover the threat of nuclear escalation as well.",

Several times before the collision, the Su-27s dumped fuel on and flew in front of the MQ-9 in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner.

Several times before the collision, the Su-27s dumped fuel on and flew in front of the MQ-9 in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner.

Without orders, I won\u2019t produce anything,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Armin Papperger said in an interview. \u201cAny shortage of ammunition won\u2019t be the defense industry\u2019s fault. Industry can deliver what\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\n>Slow progress finalizing orders means Rheinmetall will produce shells at around two-thirds capacity this year, Papperger said. That\u2019s despite repeated warnings from Ukrainian and European officials that sufficient supply of artillery munitions will prove a decisive factor in the ongoing war.\n\n>Availability of 155-millimeter caliber ammunition, a type of NATO standard shell, are increasingly in focus as Ukraine looks to hold off a Russian offensive centered around the Donetsk region. Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has said the country\u2019s armed forces require more than 350,000 shells per month, more than three times the amount it\u2019s currently using. \n\n>Reznikov has asked the European Union to provide 250,000 shells per month, an amount Papperger said \u201cwould be difficult to produce.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe capacity in Europe would have to be doubled to achieve that rate,\u201d he said. \n\n>Rheinmetall can currently produce 450,000 artillery rounds per year globally and aims to increase to 600,000 rounds in the next two years with extra capacity at its Varpalota site in Hungary and a new powder factory in the east German state of Saxony, the CEO said. The company expects the Saxony government to approve plans for the factory, which would involve a \u20ac700 million ($750 million) to \u20ac800 million investment, in the next few weeks.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s a national security project.

Now US officials allege he\u2019s at the center of a suspected secret supply chain that prosecutors say used American technology to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\n>The son of a Siberian governor was arrested last year on charges that he and his associates defrauded the US and its companies and also violated sanctions by selling sensitive technologies from the US to Russia via intermediaries in non-sanctioned countries. He\u2019s the most politically connected Russian to be indicted by the US as Washington races to choke off Moscow\u2019s access to chips used in weapons systems. Uss has denied any wrongdoing and is now in the midst of an extradition battle in Milan.\n\n>Court documents from the Uss case and others like it show how Russia allegedly built a secret pipeline for years before the war to ensure the supply of semiconductors to the country despite US controls. Those well-honed tactics are now helping Russian operators rebuild dismantled networks and deceive publicly listed US tech companies, according to customs data, indictments and people familiar with the matter, who weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media.\n\n>American prosecutors haven\u2019t identified the semiconductor manufacturers who may have sold to Uss\u2019s team unwittingly, and he is now under house arrest in Milan. \n\n>Even so, US and EU officials say that Russia is still able to get chips and technology for military use through other networks. Customs data analyzed by the British think tank Royal United Services Institute and seen by Bloomberg also show that semiconductors made by large companies including Analog Devices Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., and Microchip Technology Inc. have been getting to Russia via third-party firms in other parts of the world for months after the war started. The companies say they follow the law, don\u2019t sell to Russia and they haven\u2019t authorized the sale of their products there.  \n\n>\u201cWe should be assuming that much of our sensitive technologies are making their way into the wrong hands,\u201d said Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner and chair of the national security practice at Washington-based law firm Wiley Rein LLP, who served as a senior official at the US Department of Commerce. \u201cThe third-party intermediary problem is a fairly easy and significant loophole.\u201d\n\n>Uss and his associates allegedly operated before and after the invasion, according to a US indictment. Prosecutors say they set up small shell companies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia  \u2014 essentially Trojan horses to convince chip-makers in California, Pennsylvania and New York that they were selling to non-sanctioned jurisdictions. \n\n>They fabricated certificates that falsified the end user, the charges allege. One front company they set up in Malaysia had several addresses, but only one had a visible sign and even that was located in an empty room in a strip mall, the prosecutors allege. The items were ultimately sent to customers in Russia, including US-sanctioned defense contractors, the indictment says. \n\n>The same indictment also accuses Uss\u2019s team of simultaneously profiting by selling sanctioned Venezuelan oil. The Russian defendants are also charged with defrauding US banks. \n\n>Uss, 40, says he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, isn\u2019t responsible for anything his associates may have allegedly done, and argues that he shouldn\u2019t be extradited because he risks being treated unfairly in the US, people familiar with his legal defense say, declining to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media. Dressed in a dark gray suit as he left his closed door hearing in Milan in February, he declined to comment. His lawyers also declined to answer questions.  \n\n>The US has had restrictions on Russian purchases of military-related technology for years, but it\u2019s been sharply accelerating those controls since Putin invaded Ukraine in February last year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia doesn\u2019t consider the restrictions placed by US \u201clegal from the point of view of international law.\u201d\n\n>\u201cSanctions are what has been decided on by the UN Security Council \u2014 these are nothing more than unilateral, illegal restrictions,\u201d Peskov said. \n\n>Semiconductors are becoming increasingly important to the outcome of the war. Russia has been ramping up its push to get chips, suggesting its stockpiles aren\u2019t deep enough and Moscow\u2019s efforts are unlikely to have resolved shortages, said Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s government has publicly urged tech giants including Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. to stop making microchips that it says support Russia\u2019s Glonass satellite navigation system. Representatives at Qualcomm and Broadcom declined to comment.\n\n>Analog Devices in a statement said that any post-sanctions shipments into Russia, the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine and Belarus is a direct violation of its policies \u201cand the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion of ADI products.\u201d The company has ramped up monitoring of gray market activities, it said.\n\n>Microchip also said in a statement that it doesn\u2019t sell to sanctioned regions and works on screening customers.\n\n>\u201cWe do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren\u2019t designed for,\u201d Texas Instruments said in a statement, adding that it doesn\u2019t sell into Russia or Belarus.",

Those well-honed tactics are now helping Russian operators rebuild dismantled networks and deceive publicly listed US tech companies, according to customs data, indictments and people familiar with the matter, who weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media.</p>\n\n<p>American prosecutors haven\u2019t identified the semiconductor manufacturers who may have sold to Uss\u2019s team unwittingly, and he is now under house arrest in Milan. </p>\n\n<p>Even so, US and EU officials say that Russia is still able to get chips and technology for military use through other networks. Customs data analyzed by the British think tank Royal United Services Institute and seen by Bloomberg also show that semiconductors made by large companies including Analog Devices Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., and Microchip Technology Inc. have been getting to Russia via third-party firms in other parts of the world for months after the war started. The companies say they follow the law, don\u2019t sell to Russia and they haven\u2019t authorized the sale of their products there.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe should be assuming that much of our sensitive technologies are making their way into the wrong hands,\u201d said Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner and chair of the national security practice at Washington-based law firm Wiley Rein LLP, who served as a senior official at the US Department of Commerce. \u201cThe third-party intermediary problem is a fairly easy and significant loophole.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Uss and his associates allegedly operated before and after the invasion, according to a US indictment. Prosecutors say they set up small shell companies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia  \u2014 essentially Trojan horses to convince chip-makers in California, Pennsylvania and New York that they were selling to non-sanctioned jurisdictions. </p>\n\n<p>They fabricated certificates that falsified the end user, the charges allege. One front company they set up in Malaysia had several addresses, but only one had a visible sign and even that was located in an empty room in a strip mall, the prosecutors allege. The items were ultimately sent to customers in Russia, including US-sanctioned defense contractors, the indictment says. </p>\n\n<p>The same indictment also accuses Uss\u2019s team of simultaneously profiting by selling sanctioned Venezuelan oil. The Russian defendants are also charged with defrauding US banks. </p>\n\n<p>Uss, 40, says he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, isn\u2019t responsible for anything his associates may have allegedly done, and argues that he shouldn\u2019t be extradited because he risks being treated unfairly in the US, people familiar with his legal defense say, declining to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media. Dressed in a dark gray suit as he left his closed door hearing in Milan in February, he declined to comment. His lawyers also declined to answer questions.  </p>\n\n<p>The US has had restrictions on Russian purchases of military-related technology for years, but it\u2019s been sharply accelerating those controls since Putin invaded Ukraine in February last year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia doesn\u2019t consider the restrictions placed by US \u201clegal from the point of view of international law.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSanctions are what has been decided on by the UN Security Council \u2014 these are nothing more than unilateral, illegal restrictions,\u201d Peskov said. </p>\n\n<p>Semiconductors are becoming increasingly important to the outcome of the war. Russia has been ramping up its push to get chips, suggesting its stockpiles aren\u2019t deep enough and Moscow\u2019s efforts are unlikely to have resolved shortages, said Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s government has publicly urged tech giants including Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. to stop making microchips that it says support Russia\u2019s Glonass satellite navigation system. Representatives at Qualcomm and Broadcom declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>Analog Devices in a statement said that any post-sanctions shipments into Russia, the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine and Belarus is a direct violation of its policies \u201cand the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion of ADI products.\u201d The company has ramped up monitoring of gray market activities, it said.</p>\n\n<p>Microchip also said in a statement that it doesn\u2019t sell to sanctioned regions and works on screening customers.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren\u2019t designed for,\u201d Texas Instruments said in a statement, adding that it doesn\u2019t sell into Russia or Belarus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

There is a world of difference between cultural understanding and communications in the 18th C and the 21stC. </p>\n\n<p>The two points above also argue that Scotland should be allowed independence from the UK (for example) but that &quot;whataboutism&quot; is beside this point, that Russia has it seems <strong>both</strong> an unquenchable desire for expansion and a track record of attempting cultural genocide through forced russification (Baltic states post WW2 in particular as well as Ukraine from Russian revolution through to date as examples, there&#39;s plenty more).</p>\n\n<p>A Russian federation broken up into nations that want to be grouped together (I am not arguing for any imperialist / colonial era imposition of borders) would both be less inclined towards forced Russification as those who are currently minorities and their languages and cultures would be stronger in many of those states, but also not have the force projection capability that the resources of this massive territory allow for the very small numbers of people who control that wealth. </p>\n\n<p>The geopolitical shift of a Russian break up would not only make Europe and Asia safer, it would be an opportunity for the peoples east of the Urals to have a greater level of control of their wellbeing and a greater share of the wealth found in their area (as opposed to it all being siphoned back to Moscow)</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "There's been a lot of increasing chatter about [the ICC and an alleged 'special tribunal'](https://kyivindependent.com/news-feed/minister-two-more-countries-join-core-group-on-special-tribunal-for-russian-crime-of-aggression) and it just doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n1. None of the key players are party to the ICC (Ukraine, Russia or the US more tangentially). I realise that it's in the statute for non-parties to 'grant jurisdiction' to the ICC (and ukraine has done so), but that in itself seems bizarre. Either you respect the ICC and its authority or you don't. The idea that you can do whatever you want and then turn around when it's convenient and say 'actually we really want your help.... but only on this one issue.... and then afterwards we don't want to be held to account any more' just seems ridiculous.\n\n2. 'The west' has no authority to set up a special tribunal. That is the prerogative of the UNSC. How is it possibly going to work without just being dismissed as performative and lacking any credibility?\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nAlso according to what i can see ([for example this website](https://www.pgaction.org/ilhr/rome-statute/ukraine.html)) Zelensky took over with the country primed to ratify ICC membership, but then he withdrew it despite stating that ratification was one of his key priorities. The rada then later passed legislation regarding crimes against humanity.... and Zelensky still hasn't signed that into law either (Bill no. 2689).\n\n>> Since 30 June 2019, with all remaining constitutional obstacles removed, the Ukrainian parliament may ratify the Rome Statute. The formal ratification of the RS is subject to an active act of approval, through a law adopted by the Verkhovna Rada and signed by the President, followed by a deposit of the instrument of ratification at the UN Secretary General.\n\n>> A large majority of Ukrainian officials, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of Justice fully support the ratification and have expressed informally several times to civil society and EU officials that the delay was a decision of the former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroschenko. In August 2019, then Deputy Head of President Zelenskyi\u2019s Office, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said that one of the President\u2019s priorities would be to ratify the ICC Rome Statute. The Ministry of Justice was ready to submit an existing draft law to the Parliament for the ratification of the RS. Such draft has been transmitted to the Office of the President in September 2019. However, it was withdrawn a year later.\n\nMaybe someone can fill me in, because none of this makes any sense\n\n>> On 20 May 2021, the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament of Ukraine) adopted the Bill no. 2689 \u201cOn amendments to certain legislative acts on the Enforcement of International Criminal and Humanitarian Law\u201d, with 248 votes in favour out of 363 Members present. However, months after its adoption, the law has yet to be signed and promulgated by the President of Ukraine in order to enter into force, or it will remain inoperative.\n\n>> Under Article 94 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the President should sign the Law within 15 days from its receipt or return it to parliament for reconsideration. In the absence of action by the President in that timeframe, the Law should be considered approved and must be signed and officially promulgated. However, the effects of this article have not been triggered and the law continues being inoperative.\n\nObviously this has been an issue that has been relevant and under discussion for years, yet nothing has happened. Why not just ratify ICC membership if it's so important? Why not sign into law the bill passed by the parliament specifically to deal with these issues? Am i missing something?",

I realise that it&#39;s in the statute for non-parties to &#39;grant jurisdiction&#39; to the ICC (and ukraine has done so), but that in itself seems bizarre. Either you respect the ICC and its authority or you don&#39;t. The idea that you can do whatever you want and then turn around when it&#39;s convenient and say &#39;actually we really want your help.... but only on this one issue.... and then afterwards we don&#39;t want to be held to account any more&#39; just seems ridiculous.</p></li>\n<li><p>&#39;The west&#39; has no authority to set up a special tribunal. That is the prerogative of the UNSC. How is it possibly going to work without just being dismissed as performative and lacking any credibility?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Also according to what i can see (<a href=\"https://www.pgaction.org/ilhr/rome-statute/ukraine.html\">for example this website</a>) Zelensky took over with the country primed to ratify ICC membership, but then he withdrew it despite stating that ratification was one of his key priorities. The rada then later passed legislation regarding crimes against humanity.... and Zelensky still hasn&#39;t signed that into law either (Bill no. 2689).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since 30 June 2019, with all remaining constitutional obstacles removed, the Ukrainian parliament may ratify the Rome Statute. The formal ratification of the RS is subject to an active act of approval, through a law adopted by the Verkhovna Rada and signed by the President, followed by a deposit of the instrument of ratification at the UN Secretary General.</p>\n\n<p>A large majority of Ukrainian officials, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and of Justice fully support the ratification and have expressed informally several times to civil society and EU officials that the delay was a decision of the former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroschenko. In August 2019, then Deputy Head of President Zelenskyi\u2019s Office, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said that one of the President\u2019s priorities would be to ratify the ICC Rome Statute. The Ministry of Justice was ready to submit an existing draft law to the Parliament for the ratification of the RS. Such draft has been transmitted to the Office of the President in September 2019. However, it was withdrawn a year later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe someone can fill me in, because none of this makes any sense</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On 20 May 2021, the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament of Ukraine) adopted the Bill no. 2689 \u201cOn amendments to certain legislative acts on the Enforcement of International Criminal and Humanitarian Law\u201d, with 248 votes in favour out of 363 Members present. However, months after its adoption, the law has yet to be signed and promulgated by the President of Ukraine in order to enter into force, or it will remain inoperative.</p>\n\n<p>Under Article 94 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the President should sign the Law within 15 days from its receipt or return it to parliament for reconsideration. In the absence of action by the President in that timeframe, the Law should be considered approved and must be signed and officially promulgated. However, the effects of this article have not been triggered and the law continues being inoperative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously this has been an issue that has been relevant and under discussion for years, yet nothing has happened. Why not just ratify ICC membership if it&#39;s so important? Why not sign into law the bill passed by the parliament specifically to deal with these issues? Am i missing something?</p>\n</div>",
