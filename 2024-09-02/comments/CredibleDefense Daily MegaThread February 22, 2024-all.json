Satellite imagery showed that the burning took place [over several days](https://x.com/Nrg8000/status/1760566077988417843?s=20) and recorded radio traffic captured Tat officers [explicitly calling for the town to be razed](https://x.com/nicholas6284/status/1760258972698001608?s=20).\n\nThe Junta appears to be embracing a scorched-earth policy with regards to urban areas they do not feel they can hold. Routinely, Tat columns, particularly the notorious Ogre Column, will burn down rural buildings and large sections of villages as a punitive measure. However, this seems different. My worry is that this will become a systematic action within resistance territory as the Junta consolidates its position and trains up more troops after a pretty brutal conscription law just got introduced. They\u2019ll hold onto power in their core areas while destroying the periphery of the country.\n\nThings are difficult, though resistance forces fight on regardless.",

Everything else is corvettes (small littoral ships), submarines, and support.\n\nThe last three German frigate classes were the *Brandenburg* class (F123), the *Sachsen* class (F124), and the *Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg* class (F126).\n\nThe *Brandenburg* class was commissioned in the mid-1990s, displaces about 3,600 tons (typical for most frigates), and featured various guns and 16 Mark 41 VLS. That's a relatively small number compared to other frigates, which traditionally sport VLS numbers in the 40s. There are also 8 harpoons.\n\nThe *Sachsen* class was commissioned in the mid-2000s, displaces 5,700 tons and rocks 32 VLS. Better, but not exactly a lot.\n\nThe *Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg* class, which I assume you referred to, entered service from 2019, and has no VLS at all, only guns, CIWS and 8 (!) Harpoon missiles (not launchers, single missiles), despite weighing in at a whopping 7,200 tons.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The *Saarland* class (F126) started construction a couple of months ago. It will displace 10,500 tons and see a return to VLS - a whopping 16! To put that into perspective, the latest version of the *Arleigh-Burke* class destroyers are somewhat lighter, and feature 96 VLS.\n\nSo there's another completely under-armed frigate (but actually destroyer) class in the works. It's only the F127 mentioned above that may see a return to true peer-to-peer capabilites, and it's in the early planning stages.\n\nAnd no, I am not selectively focusing on VLS only to hide some other advanced weapons systems. All of the classes have the usual guns and machine cannons, some CIWS, and that's it, with the exception of the older *Brandenburg* class with their torpedoes.\n\nSo contrary to your comment, we have two anemic classes unfit for peer-to-peer combat, another one in the works, and only the one after that may look better. The *Brandenburg* was the last somewhat capable design, which is impressive given it weight about 1/3 of what the *Saarland* class will displace.",

It&#39;s only the F127 mentioned above that may see a return to true peer-to-peer capabilites, and it&#39;s in the early planning stages.</p>\n\n<p>And no, I am not selectively focusing on VLS only to hide some other advanced weapons systems. All of the classes have the usual guns and machine cannons, some CIWS, and that&#39;s it, with the exception of the older <em>Brandenburg</em> class with their torpedoes.</p>\n\n<p>So contrary to your comment, we have two anemic classes unfit for peer-to-peer combat, another one in the works, and only the one after that may look better. The <em>Brandenburg</em> was the last somewhat capable design, which is impressive given it weight about 1/3 of what the <em>Saarland</em> class will displace.</p>\n</div>",

The Tu-160 was always a step above the Bone in strategic capabilities which isn't surprising considering the aircraft is absolutely massive and held a different role from the offset. This isn't to say the B1B is bad, they're both excellent aircraft, just that they're two different aircraft borne out of two different design philosophies and intended missions.\n\nOn the note of generational technology, whilst you're correct that the Russians are generationally behind, this is still a major milestone for Russia, not only have they rebuilt the tooling and machine process/knowledge to build large aircraft again which is something they've struggled greatly with since the collapse of the USSR but they have also re-pioneered several processes in the original construction techniques that were lost during the decades of stagnation. Those techniques such as electron welding and vacuum welding of titanium are generational leaps that can be applied to other modern aircraft and industrial processes. They are still a generation behind and it remains to be seen if they keep this pace, but they're no longer standing still and their capabilities continue to increase. The Russia we're seeing today is not the same Russia that in the early 2000s largely left its staggering military inheritance to rot on the decaying concrete of its airfields.\n\n\\-----------------  \nFeel free to ignore the rest of this, it's mostly just historical rambling about the ins and outs of these two aircraft, if anyone is interested then by all means  \n\\-----------------\n\nThe Tu160 was originally designed to lob primarily Nuclear (and conventional missiles) from standoff distances whilst at extreme range from the Soviet Union. All of its characteristics are geared towards an end game level nuclear exchange, right down to the paint of the aircraft which is where it gets its name \"White Swan\", the aircraft are all painted anti-flash white. All other considerations aside from \"get into the air fast, carry a lot of nuclear missiles, carry them far and fast\" were secondary, so whilst the B1B (after many upgrades) might be more capable in a conventional sense, it's not truly comparable because they do not share the same mission.\n\nThe B1 had a far messier design approach which led to some fundamental differences between the two aircraft both in terms of payload capacity and also speed. This isn't to say the B1 is bad, far from it, just that they're different and harder to compare.\n\nThe B1A was originally designed to be a supersonic (Mach 2) bomber (which would put it on par with the Tu160) but this was later revised with the removal of the variable inlets and much of its titanium reinforcement, largely to save cost. The Bone was then redesigned to focus on low level penetration, whilst retaining supersonic capability (around Mach 1.2). This ultimately ended up being the final design of the B1B although even during early production they knew that it would likely never truly fulfil that role.\n\nThe program was extremely contentious and several calls to scrap it entirely were answered and later reversed. To make matters worse the US realized that rapidly increasing Soviet interceptor capabilities (notably the incoming MiG-31) would make the low level penetration role extremely challenging if not impossible, even with the B1B's radar reduction measures, the true solution to this was a program launched just after the B1 was cancelled for the first time, the B2.\n\nThe B1B had its production total revised down to just 100 units from the originally planned 240. This was largely off the backs of questions regarding its capabilities and niche role. But the program was essentially in too deep at this stage and inertia brought us the Bone (and thank god it did, the B1B is a beautiful aircraft and after several upgrades a conventional powerhouse).\n\nThe reason its design process is important is because it gave us a very different aircraft. The B1B is significantly slower than the Tu160, it's a different design philosophy. One is an integral part of the Russian nuclear triad, the other is relegated to a conventional bomber after the abrupt end of its nuclear mission and the infeasibility of its design approach due to changing technology.\n\nThe Tu160 is significantly faster, has a longer range and its internal weapons payload is substantially larger. It also carries more mature nuclear weapons.\n\nThe B1B holds its own in two key respects, low radar cross section (although its new mission includes external payloads which negate this) and a much more diverse suite of fully integrated conventional weaponry.\n\nThey are visually similar and were both originally designed for nuclear missions, but their design approaches even considering that were very different. Russian and American aircraft frequently look very similar, born out of competition and a \"tit for tat\" approach, but there are still some very large differences. A great example of this is the F-15 and the MiG-25. A fundamental difference in design philosophy despite being somewhat similar on the surface of things (from the designers perspective) brought about the most successful fighter of all time.",

Or doomposting?\n\nBit of both, it's not bad doomposting though, these are all genuine concerns and particularly coupled with Ukraine's manpower issues could prove disastrous if we don't pull our collective heads out of our asses. Just this week there are EU countries veto'ing external ammunition purchases for Ukraine, despite the fact Ukraine is under extreme artillery rationing and EU production whilst increasing, also has to be divided amongst exports and internal replenishment...\n\nProduction ramp ups being what they are, 2025 but realistically closer to 2026, the pressure from a material perspective will lessen considerably, particularly when it comes to artillery ammunition.

It allows China to impose meaningful cost on west with a blockade, let alone if it an invasion succeeded.\n\nMy issue is that those advanced chips are mostly being exported to China where they're put into smartphones and other devices, then shipped to the West. So regardless of where the chips are made, China is still a vital link in the chain of production and so can impose an immense cost on the West. \n\nIt's true that the links China provides in the production chain are more replaceable than the link the Taiwanese chips provide, but replacing those Chinese links would still cause utter economic chaos in the West. \n\n> Your comment seemed to suggest that would automatically land in broader conflict with China (trade or hot) it it took action on taiwan, but I'm not sure that is the case with the america first wing wielding such clout.\n\nI apologise if that was the way my comment came across. I completely agree that it's no sure thing that the US would intervene if China invaded Taiwan. As long as Xi doesn't attack the US first, I expect there would be a strong sentiment in the US to only provide supplies to Taiwan and not engage directly.

So regardless of where the chips are made, China is still a vital link in the chain of production and so can impose an immense cost on the West. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s true that the links China provides in the production chain are more replaceable than the link the Taiwanese chips provide, but replacing those Chinese links would still cause utter economic chaos in the West. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your comment seemed to suggest that would automatically land in broader conflict with China (trade or hot) it it took action on taiwan, but I&#39;m not sure that is the case with the america first wing wielding such clout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I apologise if that was the way my comment came across. I completely agree that it&#39;s no sure thing that the US would intervene if China invaded Taiwan. As long as Xi doesn&#39;t attack the US first, I expect there would be a strong sentiment in the US to only provide supplies to Taiwan and not engage directly.

One uses a simple code that could help detect enemy drones. The other uses a simple code that could help detect enemy soldiers. Both apps could be deployed immediately\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/115181929/Aerial\\_Object\\_Detection\\_updated\\_for\\_combat\\_deployment\\_](https://www.academia.edu/115181929/Aerial_Object_Detection_updated_for_combat_deployment_)\n\n*Wait for the model to load before clicking the button to enable the webcam - at which point it will become visible to use. The app will beep when an aerial object is located. The longer an aerial object is hovering near you, the longer the beeping noise. For soldiers, this could mean that a drone is targeting them. Ideally, soldiers would use the app on their cell phones and attach the device to the top area of their vehicles or to their body while sleeping in the trenches. Keep mind that sim cards must be removed and cell phone wireless connectivity must remain \"off\" in combat environments. Before deployment, soldiers should connect to wifi and start the app. Once the app is started, a soldier can then disable wifi and leave the app running as he/she is deployed into a combat zone. For detecting aerial objects in combat, android phone should be mounted to the top of the backpack or top of the helmet. In civilian environments, the cell phone, with wireless turned on, could be placed on rooftops. With internet access, a user could view the aerial scene remotely with facebook live*\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/115225324/Intruder\\_Detection\\_App\\_urban\\_warfare\\_and\\_counter\\_insurgency\\_with\\_Javascript](https://www.academia.edu/115225324/Intruder_Detection_App_urban_warfare_and_counter_insurgency_with_Javascript)\n\n*Wait for the model to load before clicking the button to enable the webcam-at which point it will become visible to use. The app will beep when an intruder is detected. The app will also emit voice alert, saying \"intruder detected\" upon detection of an intruder. This app allows phones to be mounted in various places, to which it can detect when an intruder is in the area. This can be used in clearing and counter insurgency operations. This is also useful for the civilian population against thugs and other criminal elements in urban environments. The app can prevent ambush attacks. The phone could be placed in the cracks of walls and other discreet locations. With internet access, a user could view the scene remotely with facebook live and see when intruders have gained unauthorized access.*",

The app will beep when an aerial object is located. The longer an aerial object is hovering near you, the longer the beeping noise. For soldiers, this could mean that a drone is targeting them. Ideally, soldiers would use the app on their cell phones and attach the device to the top area of their vehicles or to their body while sleeping in the trenches. Keep mind that sim cards must be removed and cell phone wireless connectivity must remain &quot;off&quot; in combat environments. Before deployment, soldiers should connect to wifi and start the app. Once the app is started, a soldier can then disable wifi and leave the app running as he/she is deployed into a combat zone.
