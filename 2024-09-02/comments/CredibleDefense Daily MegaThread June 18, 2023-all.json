      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Anyone with experience following those conflicts will remember lots of footage of VBIEDs, both being destroyed and reaching their targets. The advantage of a VBIED is that thousands of pounds of explosives doesn't really care about trenches or hardpoints, anyone within a hundred meters (or more) is probably dead or disabled. ISIS used them to good effect in urban warfare, where they could spring up on small units and close to lethal distance before being destroyed. Bottom line, they can be effective weapons.\n\nFor two, VBIEDs can be a substitute for artillery, especially in an environment where munitions are scarce and counterbattery is common. Russia may not have a lot of 155mm shells laying around, but may have deep stores of plastic explosives or HE ammunition that they can stuff a tank with. Obviously the disadvantage is that it still needs to cross no man's land to get to a target, but VBIEDs are inherently a one way trip, so they don't need to advance carefully or slowly and can catch defenders off guard (and, again, by the time it's in RPG range it's probably close enough to kill or rattle defenders)\n\nFinally, a T-55 is actually *ideal* for this because it is both small arms proof and in great supply. IFVs/APCs, even old ones, still have use as troop carriers. Old MBTs are so outdated that they can only really serve as assault guns, and those need a crew of some kind (which means less manpower elsewhere). A remote controlled VBIED needs just one operator for each vehicle, and a vehicle lost does not mean a crew lost. If russia is stretched thin for vehicle crews, this relaxes that need while allowing them to tap into deep stocks of older tanks.\n\nSo I wouldn't call it an entirely untested or bizarre tactic.

It's a 1-8x scope with integrated laser range finder, ballistic computer, atmospheric sensors, and a automatically adjusting recital for range. This would significantly increase the ability of the shooter to get shots on target at longer ranges.\n\nAs a former USMC marksmanship instructor and shooting team member, and a US Army school trained sniper squad leader, I disagree. I wish it were that easy. \n\nForget rifles for a second. That Fire Control (FC) day optic would be useful in concept (though totally wrong magnification) for snipers, who already have access to all that data and more from separate techniques or devices, and maybe as-is for actual well trained designated marksman. \n\nBut the average Infantryman, cav scout, etc will get little practical use of it. If the price tag was only a bit more than an ACOG in price, but that's not the case (FC will rightly be super expensive and still pretty delicate due to untried technology). \n\nIntentionally hitting a man sized target at distance is hard, even when many of the variables have been taken into account. Let's look at which they try to help with:\n\n)- Range: Using a laser range finder, the FC can give accurate-ish range estimations so it can set elevation (though likely not angle, which totally changes the math). The lack of a LRF at the rifle squad has been an issue in the past that wasn't rectified in the US Army in particular, despite the relatively cheapness of decent commercial grade hunting LRFs for use inside effective range of existing small arm, and because of the tactical realities of the Afghan War, where engagement ranges where platoon level firefights were regularly 500-900 meters. So IMO this is the most useful feature. That said, without knowing angle formulas, elevation will never be on in those settings. Not only useful in mountains, but urban terrain, shooting from high ground to low. \n\n)- Atmospherics: the FC supposed can provide barometric reading, which means altitude and air pressure, both of which affect external ballistics, which means a shift in point of aim point of impact (POA/POI) for known zero. This is actually incredibly important for skilled snipers who have the skill to make long range shots on reduced sized targets. I'll be honest, the data helps but it's NOT foolproof. However, for reasons I'll get into later, the average combat arms Soldier will NEVER have the ability to take a 1 minute of angle shot, the skill is beyond them. Furthermore, and not many people realize this, but service rifles aren't re-zeroed on a regular basis, even in combat zones. Due to powder temps caused by outside temperature and amount of Sun light, and especially altitude changes, muzzle velocities change. Clean your barrel thoroughly enough, your zero changes. Move your optic, bang it too hard, change ammo lots (no to major POA/POI changes in between), accidentally slip the scope rings while messing around (happened to a fellow student at sniper school day of KD qual, he failed), and you lose zero. Without regularly confirming your zero, weekly by top tier SOF and the best snipers, there is a good chance your rifle won't hit POA/POI, which means knowing atmospherics is useless.\n\n)- Wind: I've heard FC can detect wind at the shooter's location but I don't buy it, that requires a wind meter that is capable of shifting with relation to direction. Even if it is accurate, that only detects wind at the shooter's location, whereas the wind most affecting the bullet is when it's on the downward part of the maximum ordinate/ballistic arc, which means about 2/3 the way to the target, so the shooter NEEDS to know that wind too (which is why wind calling is still seen as Voodoo and guessing, definitely not a science). Also, see other issues.\n\n)- Ballistics compensation reticle: the FC can apply the above variables into an equation that provides a digital aiming point for the shooter. It's calibrated by that specific weapon, barrel length, specific ammo load. However, older weapons had this feature too. The M16A2 had a ballistic calculator elevation target all the way out to 800 meters. And the ACOG had an etched reticle with the range drops built in. Snipers take all the data they have and apply it, either dialing scope turrets or using reticle tickmark holds. \n\nNow let's consider other variables that are even more important for making regular long range torso hits:\n\n)- The Fundamentals of Marksmanship: Without a doubt the most important parts of making hits with small arms. Not at all important for vehicles, like tanks, who have hydraulics and mechanical stabilizer equipment to keep everything rock solid and steady. The human body is a fluid filled bag of meat and bone, it sucks at naturally being stable. The Army listed fundamentals of marksmanship suck, they shortened them to make it easier to memorize only 3, so I'll use the USMC: aiming, stability of hold, breath control, trigger control and follow through. There are numerous facets of each, but \"stability of hold \" aka knowing how to build a stable firing position is the most important.\n\nBesides good optics, what device revolutionized modern sniping? Believe it or not, the modern bipod, namely Parker Hale and Harris. And even as those technologically improved they still have major limitations, hence the reason for advanced shooting tripods and other accessories including a [ridiculous assortment of \"must have\" support bags](https://wiebad.com/stability-bags/). No legit sniper or accomplished precision rifle series shooting competitor (who need to run and gun quickly to win) were seeking out anything like the FSC, they want normal optics just so high quality and rugged to the point they can withstand nearly everything. But what do already top level expert shooters, who already know all the tricks to try to stabilize a weapon, really want? More stability.\n\nFunny enough, despite the idiot top brass from Big Army who pushed to acquire the NGSW, the carbine doesn't come with a bipod. Which goes to show that the fools pushing for it (bunch of colonels and especially four star generals) know nothing about what actually goes into making long range hits. These idiots want to punch through chest ballistic plates at 600 meters but they don't have a damn clue how it happens. \n\nThis isn't the first time a committee of fools tried to push through a Wunderwaffen small arms replacement based on napkin ideas made by amateurs, it's just the first time it worked.",

In my experience I found shooting at targets silhouetted against their background at known distances to be great at practicing shooting fundamentals, but ultimately to be a very different ball game from trying to pick out an OPFOR who does not standout from their background and who is only partially visible for a short time.  My experience with a fire control system comes from using the SMAW Mod 2, which was a huge improvement over guessing the range or using the spotting rifle on the Mod 0.  The laser range finder and ballistic computer significantly improved my ability to hit targets first shot and at greater ranges. \n\nI really appreciated having a bipod on my M27 IAR for the added stability it offered for full auto bursts and engaging at longer ranges.",

I&#39;m interested on what your far more informed opinion is on the XM157 being used for designated marksmans is.</p>\n\n<p>During my short time in the Corps I found the physical aspect of fire and maneuver paired with my average marksmanship skills significantly reduced my ability to hit targets and any sort of longer ranges.  In my experience I found shooting at targets silhouetted against their background at known distances to be great at practicing shooting fundamentals, but ultimately to be a very different ball game from trying to pick out an OPFOR who does not standout from their background and who is only partially visible for a short time.  My experience with a fire control system comes from using the SMAW Mod 2, which was a huge improvement over guessing the range or using the spotting rifle on the Mod 0.  The laser range finder and ballistic computer significantly improved my ability to hit targets first shot and at greater ranges. </p>\n\n<p>I really appreciated having a bipod on my M27 IAR for the added stability it offered for full auto bursts and engaging at longer ranges.</p>\n</div>",

Though it's interesting that they didn't ask for it either.\n\nBeing that you were a Marine and know the USMC marksmanship system, let me fill you in on the utter shit show is the Big Army. You'll get a kick out of it and better understand my opposition to NGSW. \n\nFirst, Army Basic Training. You know how USMC DIs just march recruits around to actual experts who do the teaching, including legit PMIs and marksmanship coaches? Army Drill Sergeants, who get no real specialized training, do the training of their privates for pretty much everything, and it shows. It's not good. \n\nThen, when they get to their unit, it gets worse. The Army annual qualification is 1 day. Most units, including infantry, do little to no prep training before the unit goes to the range. If they do the training is squad or platoon level and varies immensely. \n\nThe process is, everyone starts at the 25 meter line, zero your rifle under the observation of NCOs from your unit (no 8531 coaches or anything like that), who tell the troops what sight adjustment to make (mostly guessing) because the troops are never taught how to adjust sights at Basic. They do 3 round grouping exercises at 25 meters using a sandbag for support until they shoot 5 shots inside a roughly 4 minute of angle circle. Then they're ready to qualify. If they can't, because they suck, they aren't removed from the line to receive quick remedial training (though some enterprising NCOs like me did it), they just give them more ammo to keep shooting, thinking that fixes everything.\n\nWhen they go to qualify, they stand in line at the pop up target range and receive almost no instructions, wire their name and unit (they don't do this in unit integrity, just the order they finish zero/grouping). Someone hands them preloaded magazines, usually unit mags that sit in the range box and of very dubious quality. Hurting that, the Army doesn't do alibis, so if you suffer a catastrophic malfunction midway through the course of fire, sucks to be you.\n\nThen you walk to your lane and fire [this ](https://soldiersystems.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/952E3B3E-504A-442D-A366-6EC3121E2DD3.jpeg) very confusing course of fire, that combines rapid acquisition of targets with marksmanship. It's all within 300 meters, so aiming is supposed to be center mass without any sight adjustment and no consideration for wind, which none are taught how to apply. \n\nFun fact about the Army range, the targetry sucks. A lot of the mechanical targets are broken and range control don't care. Many targets are utterly shot to shit from months or years of reuse so have giant gaping holes in the center so new shots don't even register as hits. You can tell range control that the 150 meter target on Lane 5 won't drop and hasn't all day, or even come up once, which means signifying misses, and they don't care. Also, they often don't mow the grass or trim the bushes or trees down range, so many targets are often not even visible to the shooter. Sucks to be you.\n\nIf you fail the first time (they call it Bolo instead of going Unk) you get right back in line and get more ammo and try again. To reintegrate, there is no standardized system to give remedial training on the spot by qualified coaches to unfuck them. They just keep doing the test hoping they'll pass.\n\nThat's it. That's Army marksmanship qualification training. Support units barely shoot besides that. Infantry and other combat arms do lots more shooting but not focused on long range or precision or fundamentals. \n\nScores are obviously low across the service, and the top brass have been upset about that for years. Instead of addressing the obvious problems they did the stupidest thing possible and made the test harder to pass, with the belief that unit commanders afraid of their unit doing bad, will be forced to train harder. Higher level commanders didn't open up the training schedule, increase ammo allocation, create Army wide courses to ensure every platoon had it's own well trained coach, or anything else. \n\nAnd now they're trying to buy their way to a fix. A high velocity rifle firing a big bullet, nevermind the recoil, will have a laser like trajectory so makes range and wind less a factor. And the optic makes it easy, point and shoot! \n\nI do agree with you that the  it could be useful with a well trained designated marksman (most Army ones aren't, they're a private given a DM rifle and told they're the DM). But is the built in range feature worth $10k? Or $500 LRF that they can pull out a pouch to quickly lase a far away target if they think it's far enough to adjust elevation? Me, I'd rather they spend the $10k on more ammo for better training. \n\nOverall, I have doubts about the designated marksman concept. I think it's hugely practical idea, but implantation in troubling, especially in the Army, between lack of training, almost no inclusion in doctrine, and overall too many specialized weapons in the rifle squad. [In the Army](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85d2db1c217295b7e2c4170fb6fe989f-lq), the lowest ranking and least experienced private gets the DM rifle, and that's the least likely to use it right.\n\nFor weapon systems looping trajectory like the SMAW, Carl Gustaf MAAWS, and even the M203/M320 40mm grenade all do much better with a laser range finder. Being off in range just a little bit can matter, so they need the LRF, though I'm not sure it needs to be built into the optic. Those weapons aren't meant for super fast target acquisition, their shot set up process is typically long enough they can separately lase the target first. That said, if they do go with an expensive optic with built in LRF and ballistic calculating reticle, those weapons use ammo that are both very expensive and they are force multipliers too, so that investment might be worth it.",

Thus, Sig designed the XM250 to have a barrel change system that can't be used when the gun is hot.  Part of this seems to be due to the Army not requiring a carry handle and Sig didn't incorporate one due to having to meet the weight requirements.  It's an interesting decision by the Army to move forward with adopting a machine gun without a quick change barrel, especially considering the 6.8 round.  I'm curious to see if the Army decides it wants a quick change barrel system for hot barrels once they start conducting more serious testing.  It would be a pretty small redesign if needed.\n\nBesides the XM157 optic, I'm not very impressed with the NGSW program either.  I think once the Army starts to really test these weapon systems in actual infantry units who are conducting fire and maneuver there will be a lot of issues brought up.",

There's guys in the same units running primary weapons that eat 5.56, 7.62x39, 7.62x51, 5.45, and it hasn't seemed to cause a major logistical issue.\n\nThat said, fighting on your home territory is a long way from an expeditionary war on the other side of the planet. But in the volumes US DOD does ammo procurement and is equipped and constructed to deploy resources, I'm now not convinced that a few pallets of this, and a few pallets of that, is materially different in difficulty to a single round. Especially because they're already supplying multiple calibers, and multiple variations on ammunition of the same caliber, to infantry units in the form of rifle, precision rifle, LMG, MMG, and HMG ammo.\n\n> The 5.56 has a bad reputation of lacking stopping power. One recent incident that comes to mind is a video about 3 or 4 months ago of Ukrainian troops stopping a Russia assault on their trench line. Russia troops got super close, the guy wearing the go pro got the drop on a couple of Russians in the trench in front of him. The Ukrainian unloaded about 3/4 of his magazine on two Russian troops in the trench and they were STILL moving.\n\nModern 5.56 is pretty good. The problem is that killing people is easy, killing them instantly is hard. It's not unusual for somebody who's been shot the hell up to be moving, squirming, talking, breathing long after they're unsalvageable even if it happened in a level 1 trauma bay.\n\nI think the interest the military has in the new round is due to:\n\n* advanced body armor defeat at distance\n* pushing out engagement ranges in concert with more advanced targeting systems\n* unifying a wider range of weapons systems around a single cartridge that can serve in multiple roles. Which may indicate that I'm wrong about the irrelevance of logistical considerations.",

This is BS.\n\nAgreed mostly, although I don't think it's wise to compare to the Z-driven telegrams. I think the issue here is that the author is arranging his language in a way that could imply that the Ukrainians are engaged in some kind of master strategy to destroy the Russian military by not attacking them. But read more charitably, I think it is also a pretty accurate description of what I have understood as a legitimate and flexible decision of the AFU. I think Obrien's reading of the situation is bad, but there is a big gap between military failure and a deliberate strategy to chip away at enemy defenses. This is my basic understanding of the situation:\n\n- Initial attacks have been basically successful in capturing a string of villages on approach to an important logistics point north of Mariupol, and that with the expectation of the Tokmak axis, Ukrainians have generally succeeded in avoiding major losses to do so.\n\n- At the same time, the Russians have thrown more reserves into the fight than expected and are more effective in mobile defense than expected, although that depends on knowing who actually expected what. Between that kink and bad weather, the AFU has generally paused the advance to conduct more shaping operations, which have included more intense of HIMARS to disrupt Russian supply to the area. \n\n- The AFU is still holding forces in reserve, likely waiting for more favorable battlefield conditions to launch the main thrust of the current offensive.\n\n- Depending on who you believe this is either (1) a flailing choice made amidst disaster for Ukraine's military which got too confident and ran right into a wall of Russian defense with green units, (2) a flexible choice by Ukraine to hold off on sending an all-out attack into non-ideal conditions in favor of continuing to probe for the best time and place to throw a haymaker while taking strategically valuable ground, or (3) the deliberate and planned measure of a steady and limited counteroffensive that bears no resemblance to the Battle of Kursk sequel Western media has been clamoring for. I tend to think the later two are the most credible. \n\nI don't think what Obrien is describing is necessarily implausible, and is basically a flowery description of a shaping or fixing operation. The Russian counterattack on Makarivka seemed to catch the AFU off guard specifically because the Russians were expected to retreat to their main defensive lines, although not to the extent that the counterattack succeeded. I have seen some speculation, although the fog of war is too thick to really tell, that the AFU has successfully goaded the Russians into committing more of their reserves than they likely wanted, and that the next stage of the fight is fixing those reserves while probing for the best place to attack.\n\nAdding to the credibility here is that this looks very similar to the battle for Kherson, down the the AFU taking heavy losses up front while in the process of understanding the most favorable approach path to the goal. Short, direct attacks along multiple axes that fix enemy units and force them to choose which approaches to defend, aimed at a choke point in Russian logistics, with the aim of pushing Ukrainian forces within arms reach of interdicting that point and putting the Russians on the brink of military catastrophe. In that case, the aim was to destroy the Antonovsky Bridge and get close enough to the dam in Nova Khakova that the Russians would withdraw rather than risk being cutoff. The current target is likely either the rail junction at Volnovakha, or the M14 between Mariupol and Berdyansk.

This group, the forward detachment, has three jobs. To hold the maximum amount of land for the defender, so they\u2019re typically dug in very closely to the enemy and very far forward of the next line. Second the forward detachment has the primary mission of slowing the attack down and breaking forward momentum by forcing the attacking force to enter into a lengthy dismounted clearing operation. Once boots hit the dirt from their carriers, the operation slows to a crawl and things become a soupy mess. Misplace one squad and your entire deployment can get fucked for half an hour while under artillery fire, or while the Forward Detachment skedoodles. The third mission of the detachment is to not get schwacked, they need to fight long enough to force the enemy to deploy, but not so long that a superior sized force envelops and destroys them. Which is to say they have a very tough mission and are expected to be hit hard and repeatedly. But if done right, the forward detachment will make the attacker stop and deploy to take one empty town after the next, waste artillery suppressing one hill after the next, every KM from the initial line of contact to the main line of resistance (MLR). \n\nThe second line is typically, but not always, the MLR. It\u2019s where the bulk of infantry will be deployed, where the densest defenses are built, where artillery is zeroed in, etc. Despite the name, there can be many MLRs. This is where Russian echelon deployments come into play. In WWII the Soviets deployed in huge depth across Eastern Europe and this was a big reason why the Germans couldn\u2019t beat them in 1941. By the time they advanced to the next obstacle, another Soviet front had established another set of defenses that had to be overcome. Today it\u2019s more likely that the Russian defenses are echeloned by BTG. Regardless, you can find maps of the general layout of these lines. People will draw all kinds of lines across all kinds of maps. But IRL these lines arnt really contiguous. Rather, Russian units will dig in on the tactical level just like their larger operational parent units. Instead of a World War One trench line, think of Russia\u2019s defenses as strong points. You may have a half KM network of disconnected trenches, each held by a different sub unit, and each backed  up by supporting weapons. For example two squads in two trenches up front, with an MG covering the sides and rear in a wooden or concrete bunker. The goal here isn\u2019t to draw a chain over the countryside that Ukraine can\u2019t cross, but to turn likely routes of advance into multilayered death traps. Mines play a very big role here, as they *should* be used to cover various routes of advance. Alone no one defensive measure does much against a determined attacker, but together in a layered and mutually supporting system you build a position that\u2019s very hard to break, but of course also represents a large investment in men, time, and material. So you best have put it in a place, and in a larger operational context, where the Ukrainians *will* have to take it. \n\nAs I said depending on how the defenses are layered there could be in the MLR several layers of strong points, and on an operational level several MLRs. Depending on how much manpower wants to invest in a certain area. Behind the MLR are two more zones. The last zone is the \u2018rear area\u2019 where you may see longer range artillery, supply depots, and HQs. If the enemy gets here, is very likely the defender is about to lose the battle. Before that, though, the Russians will usually deploy an intermediary set of positions based on fortified zones, cantonments, and strong points. Important cities may be turned into forces, the deployment zones of mechanized units may be dug in, stuff like that. Soviet/Russian doctrine sees the defensive battle as the prelude to a counterattack that leads to a general offensive. (Who doesn\u2019t think this) The mechanism for this is mobile units counter attacking and destroying the enemy thrusts. The scheme of the forward detachments + MLR are specifically to slow the advance of enemy thrusts and ensure that the only ones which really become dangerous are the very few that can fully break through. (This is different than western doctrine which emphasizes a far more fluid defense in which all attacks eventually defeated and repelled. The difference in outlook between fighting for your territory and liberating our own) When breakthrough locations are identified, they\u2019re pinned against the last line of strongpoints while mobile units move into the battle area, overwhelm the attacker, and destroy their thrust. The Russian forces then continue on to restore the MLR, and push back into the covering forces are turning a counter attack into a legit attack. So in this way, the last line of defense for them are the bastions from which fresh reserves will flow into the counter offensive. \n\nAs a caveat tho, Russian doctrine has likely evolved in ways that would be adoctrinal compared to 2022 or earlier thinking. Defensive warfare was the anathema of the Soviet way of war, it was not something most commanders chose to think about because a sustained defensive operation meant either local or overall failure. This is also why Soviet doctrine really heavily emphasizes the rapid resumption of a counter offensive. Russian doctrine evolved past this as it became clear that there was no longer a need to blitz West Germany. But the offensive bent still remained. This was likely only really stamped out in the defensive battles of last year, where Russia for the first time since, what, 1945?

Deeper has happened, like the Russian defenses at Kursk in 1943 that were around 80 miles deep. \n\nThe Russian defenses in this case are fairly thick, at around 10 miles in a lot of places. \n\n> Where is the real backbone of a defensive line: very tip of the spear or further back?\n\nIt depends what you mean by \"real backbone.\" There's usually a zone of observation and disruption on the forward edge of defenses that's meant to warn everyone about an attack and start disrupting it and the size of that zone varies. For a general idea, though, Germany's \"outpost zone\" in WW1 was often 500-1000 yards deep, then everything after that was ready to fight for real.\n\nFor me though I think the \"real backbone\" of a defensive position is probably its mobile reserve, which is not actually in the defensive line itself. Usually 20-50% of all defenders are held in the mobile reserve to launch counter-attacks against the disrupted attacker as they advance through the defenses. Even very deep defensive positions can be \"brittle\" unless you have that flexibility to send significant forces at the enemy wherever they happen to find success.",

For a general idea, though, Germany&#39;s &quot;outpost zone&quot; in WW1 was often 500-1000 yards deep, then everything after that was ready to fight for real.</p>\n\n<p>For me though I think the &quot;real backbone&quot; of a defensive position is probably its mobile reserve, which is not actually in the defensive line itself. Usually 20-50% of all defenders are held in the mobile reserve to launch counter-attacks against the disrupted attacker as they advance through the defenses. Even very deep defensive positions can be &quot;brittle&quot; unless you have that flexibility to send significant forces at the enemy wherever they happen to find success.</p>\n</div>",

We don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying their strategy is definitely Kill Ratio attrition, but we don&#39;t know. If attrition and exhaustion are both preeminent in Ukraine strategic thinking and operational planning, then an acceptable axis is anywhere they can hurt Russia physically or morally while preserving themselves. Which can mean they can attack anywhere and it would be strategically sound.</p>\n</div>",

Remember how the only real ground attacks on Russian territory was a Ukrainian backed Russian insurgent group? There's a reason for that- attacking Russia's home territory is very, very risky. Many weapons that Western countries give come with conditions. One of those conditions is that many of these weapons cannot be used to attack Russia's territory. Its why the very limited air/drone/missile attacks that Ukraine has done on Russian territory aren't using Western weapons. Its why even though Western Russia is dense of military and infrastructure targets, I'm unaware of even a single time a HIMARs has been used to strike on Russian territory. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom Russia's home territory they can effectively launch air interdiction/SEAD sorties, border skirmishes (or the threat of), and artillery strikes with near impunity. Ukraine would need even more air defenses and even more troops to guard against a permanent and ongoing threat which they cannot counter. Ukraine can do whatever the hell it wants on its own territory though. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAn offensive in Zaporizhzhia *shortens* the frontline, however. If the offensive goes as planned, successfully, it would cut the Russian forces in Southern Ukraine off from their supply routes along the coastline of the Sea of Azov, resulting in the only resupply rout through the narrow Perekop Isthmus from Crimea, which can easily result in a similar supply crisis to the Russians trying to hold Kherson city and the areas surrounding it while attempting to secure supplies across the Dnieper. If the Kherson & Zaporizhzhia Oblasts are secured, it would shorten the overall frontline and basically ensure no possible threat to the region again, since Russia lacks any meaningful amphibious assault & supply capabilities. It would also capture massive population and administrative centers, and reduce the overall number of limited western air defenses needed to secure the space. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThink of it like this comparison. In the 2003 Iraq War, ask yourself whether you would rather the US army attack from their positions in Kuwait and advance along the Tigris and Euphrates or attack the Western Anbar region? Well you could attack the West and maybe it's easier with less defenses, but what are you gaining? Its harder for your troops to resupply, you've captured no major population centers, you've put yourself in a position where the enemy is more easily able to attack you than the other way around, you're forced to spread your forces and air assets thinner, but for what?",

Air support often helps, a lot, but it's not a guarantee of successful ground operations.\n\nLikewise, a lack of air support doesn't negate success, especially when the enemy doesn't really possess it either. \n\nThe chief reason for stagnation is when enemy resistance is fiercer than anticipated. That could mean intel or high command grossly underestimated enemy abilities or resolve. Or it can just mean the fight is so severe that the difficulties can't be overcome. Anything that adds to enemy resistance can undermine the ability to attack. Likewise, anything that detracts can help achieve successful attacks.

Good read, but I'd like to know the ratio of hard sources vs kreminology that underlies it.\n\nUkraine launched a counteroffensive. In February 2022, when this war began, the Russian army was considered the second most powerful in the world. After a year and a half of combat this illusion has disappeared. Nevertheless, it is now interesting to analyze what the Russian army is like and how it has changed over the months of the war.The most important finding is that the Russian army lost twice. It is unmistakably inferior to the Ukrainian army. But she also suffered a domestic defeat: her reputation was destroyed and she was defeated by Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\n **As a result, the army has also lost the opportunity to exert a decisive influence on the power struggle in Russia after Putin.Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was one of the country's most popular figures before the start of the war - now he is the greatest anti-hero, a man whom the public blames for all failures.** \n\nA week ago, Shoigu tried to somehow reverse his position in the domestic political struggle and issued an order requiring all fighters from the so-called voluntary organizations, which also include the Wagner mercenaries, to sign a contract with the Defense Ministry from July.Prigozhin responded that the Wagner group would not sign any contracts with the Ministry of Defense because he considered cooperation with Shoigu \"criminal,\" and also suggested that all other formations should join Wagner rather than the Russian army.\n\nThis means that the financiers who fund Prigozhin and Wagner's activities (that is, Russia's largest state-owned companies like Rosneft and Gazprom) continue to support Prigozhin in the belief that he is not short of money and that he has no problems with those in power. Nor has anyone reprimanded him for his declaration of war on Shoigu.\n\nThis week, on Russia's National Day, Vladimir Putin met with a group of war correspondents from propaganda and TV channels - these have now become his favorite journalists - and answered their questions at length. This was probably Putin's longest interaction with journalists since the outbreak of war.\n\nMeeting between Putin and the war journalists\n\nAll these meetings are prepared according to the same pattern: the questions are agreed in advance, each participant receives a plan beforehand, according to which the conversation with the President will proceed. Of course, none of the military correspondents dared to ask Putin a difficult question about the confrontation between the army and Wagner.\n\nHowever, the question of Prigozhin sounded indirectly. A journalist asked Putin to comment on the situation that prisoners released by Prigozhin to take part in the war returned to their homeland after the fighting and continued to kill their own neighbors.\n\nPutin was very well prepared for this question. At first he said there was nothing wrong with it. And then he had a humorous quote ready for the occasion (recalling the words of Makar Nagulnov, the hero of Soviet writer Mikhail Sholokhov's Nobel Prize-winning novel Neuland unterm Pflug). But more importantly, he remembered the statistics - how many Wagnerians supposedly continue to kill once they've returned from the war.According to Putin, \"the recidivism rate among people who have served their sentences and returned to normal life is as high as 40 percent in some cases,\" while among the former Wagner fighters who fought in Ukraine, it was only 0.4 percent have committed crimes.\n\n The journalist-propagandist told Putin that this was still \"a spoonful of tar\" (Editor's note: a Russian proverb says: \"A spoonful of tar spoils a honey barrel\"). 'Well, that's life, it's complicated and multifaceted. And we can't do anything about it, it dictates its strict laws to us,\u201d Putin said cynically and meaningfully\n\n.Total militarization of society\n\nIn fact, a radical change in Russian society can be observed in the course of the war year - a total militarization of society has taken place. The masses of people have accepted the war and are ready to take part in it. The initial shock is over and murder is no longer taboo.At the same meeting with war correspondents, Putin proudly announced that a new Russian mobilization will not be necessary because Russians have finally started to volunteer for this war. And he even boasted about the number: Since February, 156,000 people had voluntarily gone to the front.\n\n'You know what they say: the Russian peasant harnesses his horse slowly, but he rides it quickly. People volunteer to defend their fatherland.\u00ab**However, \"voluntarily\" is a rather fraudulent description.** People go to war to make money. Given the total poverty in the Russian regions, the money offered for the war, not immediately, but only a year later, seduced many.\n\n76,000 euros for a killed soldier**The mathematics of the war are very simple: a volunteer immediately receives about 700,000 rubles (about 7600 euros), and then every month he receives a salary of about 200,000 rubles (about 2200 euros). Three million (almost 33,000 euros) are paid for a wounded soldier, and the family receives seven million (about 76,000 euros) for a killed soldier.Within a year, the government was able to convince the population that the system really worked - and people were lining up. The average salary in the regions is around 300 euros.** To receive tens of times more, albeit with a very high probability of death - the propaganda has finally convinced many men from the Russian provinces that this is a normal exchange.**Putin boasts that there is no need for mobilization. Another question is how much money he has. But it will definitely be enough for a year or several years - he doesn't have to win this war, he just has to continue it. It is precisely this state of society that is useful to him in order to stay in power.**What does this change mean for Russian society? Up until a year ago, there was practically no one at all willing to go to war, so Prigozhin had to go to prisons and recruit prisoners. But now the situation has reversed. Prisoners are no longer needed - for the money that is paid to them, free people are willing to go to war.\n\nIs a civil war coming?**It is obvious that as the standard of living deteriorates, this phenomenon will continue to spread - soon the only profitable occupation in Russia will be war.** This opens the real door to civil war \u2013 not even because of internal antagonisms, but because of the growing psychological willingness of the population to kill and live off it.At the same time, the monstrous decline in the authority of the army will, of course, turn Russia into a country of bandits. It was exciting that at the meeting with the propaganda correspondents, Putin remembered Makar Nagulnov from the novel Neuland unterm Pflug with appreciation.Nagulnov is a former soldier who fought in the Civil War, returned from there mentally ill, terrorized all the residents of his own village (some of them were murdered) and yet is fanatically loyal to Stalin.

If you imagine throwing an unspooled length of climbing rope off a very tall cliff, thats going to do about the same amount of damage hitting the ground as a basic space elevator.\n\nIf you start building it much bigger and thicker, so you can send 2100t or 21,000t up it at a time (rather than 210t).... you're going to want to install parachutes on it periodically as well in case of a break. To keep that terminal velocity low. But you're not talking equivalents of a 100t rocket at some fraction of 7 km/s. It just isn't moving very fast, and if it starts to be massive enough to acheive dangerous speeds you install parachutes on it to keep it the equivalent of \"lengths of climbing rope falling on the landscape\" levels of impact.

President Biden let Ukrainians take extreme casualties in Donbas before finally relenting and sending just four HIMARS launchers. I recall the DoD press conferences from May 2022. The journalists were incessant, asking about HIMARS every ten minutes, but the administration was consistently evasive/stonewalling.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I understand that pinning all the blame on Biden is a simple escape route. Perhaps if I were in Biden&#39;s shoes, I might have exhibited the same level of hesitation...</p>\n</div>",
