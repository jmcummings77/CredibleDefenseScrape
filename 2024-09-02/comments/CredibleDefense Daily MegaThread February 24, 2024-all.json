As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "Regarding the Royal Australian Navy I don\u2019t believe there has been discussion here of a recent anouncement on fleet \u201cexpansion\u201d and its strategic implications, so allow me to raise the following points:\n\nAccording to ADF press release: \u201c[Navy\u2019s enhanced lethality surface combatant fleet](https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/media-releases/2024-02-20/navys-enhanced-lethality-surface-combatant-fleet)\u201d The RAN will be composed as follows:\n\n26 major surface combatants consisting of:\n\n>Three Hobart class air warfare destroyers with upgraded air defence and strike capabilities  \n>  \n>Six Hunter class frigates to boost Navy\u2019s undersea warfare and strike capabilities  \n>  \n>11 new general purpose frigates that will provide maritime and land strike, air defence and escort capabilities  \n>  \n>Six new Large Optionally Crewed Surface Vessels (LOSVs) that will significantly increase Navy\u2019s long-range strike capacity  \n>  \n>Six remaining Anzac class frigates with the two oldest ships to be decommissioned as per their planned service life.\n\nThe Government has also accepted the independent analysis\u2019 recommendations to have:\n\n>25 minor war vessels to contribute to civil maritime security operations, which includes six Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs).\n\nThis is in addition to the various elements of the AUKUS submarine deal which as outlined by the White House in the [FACT SHEET:\u00a0 Trilateral Australia-UK-US Partnership on Nuclear-Powered Submarines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/13/fact-sheet-trilateral-australia-uk-us-partnership-on-nuclear-powered-submarines/) entailing:\n\n>Rotational basing at HMAS Stirling (Perth) of up to 4 American Virginia Class, and 1 UK Astute class subs  \n>  \n>The sale to Australia of 3 Virginia Class subs and the option to purchase another 2 for a total of 5 Australian Virginias (to base alongside the 4 American and 1 Astute)  \n>  \n>The acquisition of 8 SSN AUKUS class nuclear powered but conventionally armed attack submarines\n\nHidden within this announcement are some concerning details, namely that in real terms this is not a fleet expansion but a significant cut to the RAN\u2019s surface force of 5 \u201cTier 1\u201d ships, a cut which will allegedly be made good by the future acquisition of a host of unplanned, un-programmed, and until now unannounced designs that simply don\u2019t exist and haven\u2019t been budgeted.\n\nThis is in effect a large budget cut to the RAN surface fleet in order to pay for the genuinely massive expansion of the submarine service and other AUKUS elements like missile production.\n\nFirstly the Hunter Program is being reduced from an order of 9 to only 6 ships. The Hunter is Australia\u2019s component of the joint UK-Canada-Australia Type 26 Frigate program, and would have provided Australia with a class of 8,800 tons full load, with a 7000 nmi range, 32 VLS cells, and 8 canister launched AShMs. Compared to the ANZACs they replace they would be a significant improvement in capabilities and survivability, and be built domestically which while more expensive would maintain our shipbuilding industry. Given their domestic build, impact on the unit costs of UK and Canadian Type 26s would be minimal but I\u2019m sure there will still be an impact across shared subsystems and parts which ultimately add stress to the programs across these navies as well.\n\nThe reduction of Hunter Class numbers within the RAN will increase unit costs, reduce availability, reduce economies of scale on all components, and result in a more fragile ship building industry starving between less frequent builds. It also will complicate our logistical and training capacity further hampering the sustainment of high readiness rates without keeping personnel trained at greater expense across both ANZAC, Hobart, Hunter, and \u201cGeneral Purpose Future Frigate\u201d classes. (Not to mention our missile less, gun less, radar less, defenceless and utterly pointless \u201coffshore patrol vessels\u201d).\n\nAnd, for the most frustrating point of all which always seems to be constantly ignored by RAN: less ships equals less fully trained and qualified personnel at the start of a war, concentrating institutional knowledge into a smaller number of vessels, impeding career growth and professional development of officers and ratings at all levels, and increasing attrition risk. A larger fleet has more inbuilt redundancies across personnel and equipment that make it more survivable, more capable, and more flexible, and on the whole more able to deter, disrupt, and defeat an adversary.\n\nIt also impacts negatively on basing decisions between Sydney, Perth, and Darwin, and thus on response time and force composition.\n\nAs of the moment there is no news at all about the New General Purpose Frigate so far as I have seen, and it strikes me as smoke and mirrors.I continue to be baffled by the refusal to commit to the Hobart Class destroyer which is a mature design, highly capable, AEGIS equipped, has 48 VLS cells, and was successfully and recently built domestically with all of the infrastructure already in place, personnel already trained, and the navy already prepared to integrate ships and systems.\n\nJust as stupefying is the plan to build 25 \u201cminor war vessels\u201d of the patrol and minesweeping varieties yet provide them with nothing at all for defence equipment besides a 25mm bushmaster. It would be so easy to take some patrol boats, strap 8 Harpoons, or NSMs to it, and give it a Phalanx for defence. Build 50 of them and deploy to Darwin and Townsville, and just like that we would have our own equivalent of the Type 022 Houbei Class corvettes.\n\nThe reduction in ANZAC Class ships from 8 to 6 is not unexpected as these are entirely outclassed, but a blanket decommissioning is not helpful for the same reasons outlined above and would further a capability gap. The silver lining to the 2 ANZACs being decommissioned is that they could potentially be sold to New Zealand.\n\nAccording to ASPI: \u201cAustralia\u2019s \u2018tier-2\u2019 naval expansion opens the door for the Anzac frigate redux\u201d[https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/australias-tier-2-naval-expansion-opens-the-door-for-the-anzac-frigate-redux/](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/australias-tier-2-naval-expansion-opens-the-door-for-the-anzac-frigate-redux/)\n\n>Only last week, the possibility of New Zealand buying into a common hull design with Australia for the replacement to its two, aging Anzac frigates appeared remote. Australia\u2019s Hunter frigate programme, frequently castigated in the media for being overweight, overdue and overbudget, but now backed in by the surface fleet review, remains well beyond Wellington\u2019s more limited means and naval ambitions. Now, Canberra\u2019s commitment to buy an off-the-shelf frigate, of a more modest design has changed the calculus overnight, bringing the Anzac model of a synchronised warship acquisition back into play, after a long recess.\u2026  \n>  \n>That prize is a gifted opportunity to recapitalise New Zealand\u2019s surface force at an affordable price tag, with the potential for a modest expansion from 2 to 3 frigates, ensuring that the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) has at least one surface combatant available at any one time\u2014a minimal requirement given New Zealand\u2019s scale of maritime responsibilities.\n\nThe changed government in NZ may now appear willing to join in a next generation of frigates with Australia to begin rebuilding the New Zealand navy, however I do not think that this is very likely. I am no observer of NZ politics by any stretch, but given the decades of neglect inflicted upon the New Zeland defence forces (no air force, no armour, almost no artillery, and only 2 ANZAC class frigates \\[under armed MEKOs \u201cfitted for but not with\u201d\\]) I find it hard to imagine NZ jumping straight into a new off the shelf program with Australia whether this was a Hunter / Type 26 Program, or a FREMM / Constellation Program, or some other frigate. For the New Zealanders key issues with such recapitalisation are costs, infrastructure, and the rebuilding of a horribly atrophied naval service and support personnel, together with the institutional knowledge and training capacity lost in budget cuts.\n\nWhat I think could end up happening very easily is that NZ acquires from the 8 Australian ANZAC class frigates that we will be gradually decommissioning in our expansion / replacement with the Hunter and unnamed next genration frigate. As of this latest review our 8 will reduce to 6 with 2 to be decomissioned, and so it strikes me as a very sensible transition for NZ to buy both and comission 1, bringing NZ\u2019s total ANZAC class to 3 and using the 4th as scraps and training while the rebuild their institutional, personnel, and infrastructure capcity and wait for an off the shelf design to mature.This provides the benefit of allowing expansion to personnel numbers without burdening or complicating the logistics or redesigning the training system to accomodate a new class of ship and all subsystems and logistical components as the class is identical to the current NZ inventory. Concerns about under armnament of the ANZACs for Australia are not significant for New Zealand given its different strategic posture and environment, and it maintains the operational life of the class beyond Australian service meaning that in terms of the alliance we can actually achieve a real and immediate expansion rather than a paper \u201cexpansion\u201c of projected aquisitions that are decades away from operationalisation.\n\nOn the whole then the RAN is expanding, but far slower and more awkwardly than headline figures would indicate, and is continuing to suffer under a systematic inability to avoid capability gaps even when presented with proven technologies of already operationalised equipment supported by a matured domestic DIB",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Regarding the Royal Australian Navy I don\u2019t believe there has been discussion here of a recent anouncement on fleet \u201cexpansion\u201d and its strategic implications, so allow me to raise the following points:</p>\n\n<p>According to ADF press release: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/media-releases/2024-02-20/navys-enhanced-lethality-surface-combatant-fleet\">Navy\u2019s enhanced lethality surface combatant fleet</a>\u201d The RAN will be composed as follows:</p>\n\n<p>26 major surface combatants consisting of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Three Hobart class air warfare destroyers with upgraded air defence and strike capabilities  </p>\n\n<p>Six Hunter class frigates to boost Navy\u2019s undersea warfare and strike capabilities  </p>\n\n<p>11 new general purpose frigates that will provide maritime and land strike, air defence and escort capabilities  </p>\n\n<p>Six new Large Optionally Crewed Surface Vessels (LOSVs) that will significantly increase Navy\u2019s long-range strike capacity  </p>\n\n<p>Six remaining Anzac class frigates with the two oldest ships to be decommissioned as per their planned service life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Government has also accepted the independent analysis\u2019 recommendations to have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>25 minor war vessels to contribute to civil maritime security operations, which includes six Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is in addition to the various elements of the AUKUS submarine deal which as outlined by the White House in the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/13/fact-sheet-trilateral-australia-uk-us-partnership-on-nuclear-powered-submarines/\">FACT SHEET:\u00a0 Trilateral Australia-UK-US Partnership on Nuclear-Powered Submarines</a> entailing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rotational basing at HMAS Stirling (Perth) of up to 4 American Virginia Class, and 1 UK Astute class subs  </p>\n\n<p>The sale to Australia of 3 Virginia Class subs and the option to purchase another 2 for a total of 5 Australian Virginias (to base alongside the 4 American and 1 Astute)  </p>\n\n<p>The acquisition of 8 SSN AUKUS class nuclear powered but conventionally armed attack submarines</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hidden within this announcement are some concerning details, namely that in real terms this is not a fleet expansion but a significant cut to the RAN\u2019s surface force of 5 \u201cTier 1\u201d ships, a cut which will allegedly be made good by the future acquisition of a host of unplanned, un-programmed, and until now unannounced designs that simply don\u2019t exist and haven\u2019t been budgeted.</p>\n\n<p>This is in effect a large budget cut to the RAN surface fleet in order to pay for the genuinely massive expansion of the submarine service and other AUKUS elements like missile production.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly the Hunter Program is being reduced from an order of 9 to only 6 ships. The Hunter is Australia\u2019s component of the joint UK-Canada-Australia Type 26 Frigate program, and would have provided Australia with a class of 8,800 tons full load, with a 7000 nmi range, 32 VLS cells, and 8 canister launched AShMs. Compared to the ANZACs they replace they would be a significant improvement in capabilities and survivability, and be built domestically which while more expensive would maintain our shipbuilding industry. Given their domestic build, impact on the unit costs of UK and Canadian Type 26s would be minimal but I\u2019m sure there will still be an impact across shared subsystems and parts which ultimately add stress to the programs across these navies as well.</p>\n\n<p>The reduction of Hunter Class numbers within the RAN will increase unit costs, reduce availability, reduce economies of scale on all components, and result in a more fragile ship building industry starving between less frequent builds. It also will complicate our logistical and training capacity further hampering the sustainment of high readiness rates without keeping personnel trained at greater expense across both ANZAC, Hobart, Hunter, and \u201cGeneral Purpose Future Frigate\u201d classes. (Not to mention our missile less, gun less, radar less, defenceless and utterly pointless \u201coffshore patrol vessels\u201d).</p>\n\n<p>And, for the most frustrating point of all which always seems to be constantly ignored by RAN: less ships equals less fully trained and qualified personnel at the start of a war, concentrating institutional knowledge into a smaller number of vessels, impeding career growth and professional development of officers and ratings at all levels, and increasing attrition risk. A larger fleet has more inbuilt redundancies across personnel and equipment that make it more survivable, more capable, and more flexible, and on the whole more able to deter, disrupt, and defeat an adversary.</p>\n\n<p>It also impacts negatively on basing decisions between Sydney, Perth, and Darwin, and thus on response time and force composition.</p>\n\n<p>As of the moment there is no news at all about the New General Purpose Frigate so far as I have seen, and it strikes me as smoke and mirrors.I continue to be baffled by the refusal to commit to the Hobart Class destroyer which is a mature design, highly capable, AEGIS equipped, has 48 VLS cells, and was successfully and recently built domestically with all of the infrastructure already in place, personnel already trained, and the navy already prepared to integrate ships and systems.</p>\n\n<p>Just as stupefying is the plan to build 25 \u201cminor war vessels\u201d of the patrol and minesweeping varieties yet provide them with nothing at all for defence equipment besides a 25mm bushmaster. It would be so easy to take some patrol boats, strap 8 Harpoons, or NSMs to it, and give it a Phalanx for defence. Build 50 of them and deploy to Darwin and Townsville, and just like that we would have our own equivalent of the Type 022 Houbei Class corvettes.</p>\n\n<p>The reduction in ANZAC Class ships from 8 to 6 is not unexpected as these are entirely outclassed, but a blanket decommissioning is not helpful for the same reasons outlined above and would further a capability gap. The silver lining to the 2 ANZACs being decommissioned is that they could potentially be sold to New Zealand.</p>\n\n<p>According to ASPI: \u201cAustralia\u2019s \u2018tier-2\u2019 naval expansion opens the door for the Anzac frigate redux\u201d<a href=\"https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/australias-tier-2-naval-expansion-opens-the-door-for-the-anzac-frigate-redux/\">https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/australias-tier-2-naval-expansion-opens-the-door-for-the-anzac-frigate-redux/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only last week, the possibility of New Zealand buying into a common hull design with Australia for the replacement to its two, aging Anzac frigates appeared remote. Australia\u2019s Hunter frigate programme, frequently castigated in the media for being overweight, overdue and overbudget, but now backed in by the surface fleet review, remains well beyond Wellington\u2019s more limited means and naval ambitions. Now, Canberra\u2019s commitment to buy an off-the-shelf frigate, of a more modest design has changed the calculus overnight, bringing the Anzac model of a synchronised warship acquisition back into play, after a long recess.\u2026  </p>\n\n<p>That prize is a gifted opportunity to recapitalise New Zealand\u2019s surface force at an affordable price tag, with the potential for a modest expansion from 2 to 3 frigates, ensuring that the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) has at least one surface combatant available at any one time\u2014a minimal requirement given New Zealand\u2019s scale of maritime responsibilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The changed government in NZ may now appear willing to join in a next generation of frigates with Australia to begin rebuilding the New Zealand navy, however I do not think that this is very likely. I am no observer of NZ politics by any stretch, but given the decades of neglect inflicted upon the New Zeland defence forces (no air force, no armour, almost no artillery, and only 2 ANZAC class frigates [under armed MEKOs \u201cfitted for but not with\u201d]) I find it hard to imagine NZ jumping straight into a new off the shelf program with Australia whether this was a Hunter / Type 26 Program, or a FREMM / Constellation Program, or some other frigate. For the New Zealanders key issues with such recapitalisation are costs, infrastructure, and the rebuilding of a horribly atrophied naval service and support personnel, together with the institutional knowledge and training capacity lost in budget cuts.</p>\n\n<p>What I think could end up happening very easily is that NZ acquires from the 8 Australian ANZAC class frigates that we will be gradually decommissioning in our expansion / replacement with the Hunter and unnamed next genration frigate. As of this latest review our 8 will reduce to 6 with 2 to be decomissioned, and so it strikes me as a very sensible transition for NZ to buy both and comission 1, bringing NZ\u2019s total ANZAC class to 3 and using the 4th as scraps and training while the rebuild their institutional, personnel, and infrastructure capcity and wait for an off the shelf design to mature.This provides the benefit of allowing expansion to personnel numbers without burdening or complicating the logistics or redesigning the training system to accomodate a new class of ship and all subsystems and logistical components as the class is identical to the current NZ inventory.

Yes it is, however, they actually act quite a bit of independent from the control of the NUG. PDF is not really a highly centralized group across the country with a complete chain of command from the NUG. It is royal to the NUG of course and usually coordinates with it, but NUG also supplies to various other resistance groups across the country which has the common goal of resisting the Junta. NUG is like the administrative rebel group that supplies to resistent armies such as PDF and various other rebels. \n\nNUG and PDF are said to be pro-democratic and align more towards the west and anti-junta and military. I am not sure about the other rebel groups. But honestly, some of the \"other resistent armies\" such as KIA and AA doesn't really care much about overthrowing the Junta. They just want to form a totally free administrative region from Myanmar as a whole (They have been fighting way before the coup). So even if the rebels regained the control of the country, the civil war isn't gonna end anytime soon to be honest. \n\nFor the civilian suffering, it is a lot..Sometime entire villages were burnt down due to connections with the PDF or the rebels. There are so many people who are displaced by the fighting in the country. The economy is in ruined too. Normal civilians in the country sides are the one who got hit the most. War crimes are also very prominent in both sides where beheading becomes quite a rare but expectable occurrence. There is no famine though, our country is highly agricultural. It is probably the least possible thing that could happen. In the end, only the senior and highly ranked generals profit from the coup. Soldiers and lower ranking officers suffer from it and innocent civilians suffer from it. \n\nIt might be an unpopular opinion but government workers also suffer from it and are now really looked down upon, even though most of them joined way before the coup and generally don't support the coup at all. They are highly prosecuted in areas where the rebels took control and usually get tortured and murdered brutally (Especially if they work as a police officer) When i say police force, i am talking about like traffic controllers and building guards, not even any kind of special forces or secret police. The coup really has a profound effect for many people inside the army or just anyone who does the government work. Majority of the people i know inside the military doesn't support the coup at all at the start, but the amount of hate they receive from the population for just being related usually changes their stance for the worse. Even doctors who works with the government are looked down. The thing people need to know is 10-30 years ago, working in the military is looked up as a job and was sometime a preferred job because of the government system that time. When the coup happens,  people can't just leave the army or their respective government work. They are forced to work until they reach their retirement age (Same for the normal government workers).

China \"supports\" the current government as in the way they supported the democratically elected government, socialist government as well as older military junta in the past (Apart from the times where relationships were sour due to border skirmishes or some sorts). However, they also support the rebels, but i am not sure to what extent. But they do definitely support rebels near Shan state where it borders china and supports Chinese interests. It is a really complicated situation. As far as I know, they support the government, just like they used to in the past before the coup, and they also \"seem\" to support the rebels, just like they were accused of doing in the past. I really don't want to make any bold claims, but in summary, I believe that china is not supporting the Junta because it is \"Junta\", they don't really care much about whoever in charge. They just want to remain friendly enough to whatever defacto or official government in charge of the country. They just want to stabilize the region, do business and expand their influence.

                        "body": "Both sides have plenty of air support and especially ISR, that's the problem. They have all the pieces of air power:\n\n)- Strategic Air Power: The Father of modern Air Power, this is air strikes meant to win the war independently due to their target selection. Think US and UK especially in WW2, where Bomber Chiefs in England believed ground and naval campaigns were unnecessary because they alone would win the war targeting things like war production, oil, and especially morale. In this war we've seen plenty of both, no longer done by fixed wing bombers they're done by ballistic and cruise missiles and long range drones. And like every single previous war it's been done, the results are both controversial and inconclusive.\n\nTactical air power can be broken down into these missions and effects.\n\n)- Aerial recon: The original air power mission, everything else was originally an expansion on this role. Go over the front lines and especially into enemy held territory to get intelligence on the enemy. That's never been better than now with the prevalence of drones, to the point it's extremely hard to mass forces and move them forward and then conduct a combined arms breach, assault and consolidation without being spotted and engaged.\n\n)- Close Air support: Use of air strikes against enemy forces along the Forward Line of Own Troops in direct support, to provide additional fire support. Traditionally done by rotary and fixed wing ground attack aircraft, either dedicated or multirole, between glide bombs, lofting rocket strikes, and loitering munition/FPV drone attacks, this is being done plenty in this war. Ground Based Air Defenses (GBAD) limit the effects of fixed wing and larger drones, as does inefficiencies inherent in both Russian and Ukrainian air forces, who preware didn't doctrinally prepare to provide a heavy CAS support role. In addition, both sides in this war possess about 3x the amount of artillery as their Western peers to make up for that fact, possessing a number of PGMs especially that are rather new to warfare. Do you need to drop a large number of dumb bombs if GMLRS or PGM arty can strike the target with one shot? \n\n)- Air Interdiction/Deep Air Support: That is air strikes performed beyond the front lines, in the tactical rear areas (in this war, up to 100 km deep) and into the operational rear (home of the higher level HQ territory, corps and armies and military districts, 100-200 km from the front lines), where key targets are logistical hubs, command and control nodes, supply convoys, trains, bridges, and units in march formation on the roads. All of these are being targeted in this war using deeper flying ISR drone footage, HUMINT or other intel, satellite imagery, etc, and struck by GMLRS, cruise and ballistic missiles, and long range drones.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Both sides have plenty of air support and especially ISR, that&#39;s the problem. They have all the pieces of air power:</p>\n\n<p>)- Strategic Air Power: The Father of modern Air Power, this is air strikes meant to win the war independently due to their target selection. Think US and UK especially in WW2, where Bomber Chiefs in England believed ground and naval campaigns were unnecessary because they alone would win the war targeting things like war production, oil, and especially morale. In this war we&#39;ve seen plenty of both, no longer done by fixed wing bombers they&#39;re done by ballistic and cruise missiles and long range drones. And like every single previous war it&#39;s been done, the results are both controversial and inconclusive.</p>\n\n<p>Tactical air power can be broken down into these missions and effects.</p>\n\n<p>)- Aerial recon: The original air power mission, everything else was originally an expansion on this role. Go over the front lines and especially into enemy held territory to get intelligence on the enemy. That&#39;s never been better than now with the prevalence of drones, to the point it&#39;s extremely hard to mass forces and move them forward and then conduct a combined arms breach, assault and consolidation without being spotted and engaged.</p>\n\n<p>)- Close Air support: Use of air strikes against enemy forces along the Forward Line of Own Troops in direct support, to provide additional fire support. Traditionally done by rotary and fixed wing ground attack aircraft, either dedicated or multirole, between glide bombs, lofting rocket strikes, and loitering munition/FPV drone attacks, this is being done plenty in this war. Ground Based Air Defenses (GBAD) limit the effects of fixed wing and larger drones, as does inefficiencies inherent in both Russian and Ukrainian air forces, who preware didn&#39;t doctrinally prepare to provide a heavy CAS support role. In addition, both sides in this war possess about 3x the amount of artillery as their Western peers to make up for that fact, possessing a number of PGMs especially that are rather new to warfare. Do you need to drop a large number of dumb bombs if GMLRS or PGM arty can strike the target with one shot? </p>\n\n<p>)- Air Interdiction/Deep Air Support: That is air strikes performed beyond the front lines, in the tactical rear areas (in this war, up to 100 km deep) and into the operational rear (home of the higher level HQ territory, corps and armies and military districts, 100-200 km from the front lines), where key targets are logistical hubs, command and control nodes, supply convoys, trains, bridges, and units in march formation on the roads. All of these are being targeted in this war using deeper flying ISR drone footage, HUMINT or other intel, satellite imagery, etc, and struck by GMLRS, cruise and ballistic missiles, and long range drones. While air interdiction is routine in this war, it does seem to have trouble being responsive and especially hitting moving targets.</p>\n\n<p>)- Air Superiority: The traditional air-to-air role, where combat air patrols and dedicated strike packages of fixed wing aircraft only (I&#39;m not sure any UCAV has been fielded to perform this role), who can use tactics and technology to push their opponent back to open the skies allowing them to better do the rest of the above with fixed or rotary wing aircraft.

Now they are indeed 75 thousand at the beginning of January 2024. The figure excludes the MIAs and the over-50s - according to the latest estimate by BBC News Russian, which cooperates with Mediazona, Russian fatalities at the end of September 2023 were 86 thousand (I have not found confirmation, but the figure might include the MIAs, as well as the over 50s). Also according to other estimates of these two organizations, the KIAs/MIAs of the D/LPR were more than 23 thousand. The latter died largely between the spring and the autumn of 2022, and so we must be careful about the seemingly low number of Russian KIAs during that period, even during the costly (for both sides) Donbas offensive: simply, it was largely the personnel of the armies of the two self-styled autonomous republics that fell in action. At the same time we must be careful to say that, according to such calculations, 28 thousand Russians died in the last 7 months of 2023 (75 minus 47), as the more recent the month, fewer confirmations of deaths there are, and many deaths are included later. Over the last months, sometimes a dozen, other times 20ish and up to 40 obituaries of fallen servicemen from Wagner PMC (who fell largely in the Bakhmut/Soledar campaign) are still published every week.\n\nMoreover, by Mediazona's estimate the number of fallen convicts would rise from 8 thousand (confirmed) to 19 thousand (estimated). But if we recall that per Wagner sources 15 thousand convicts had died within their ranks, it's implausible that only 4 thousand convicts died over the last year in the ranks of Storm-Z/V units. Although convicts are indeed the category for which it's most difficult to find reports confirming their deaths. \n\nMy personal estimate is that Russia's irretrievable losses (dead, missing, wounded permanently unable to serve, POWs currently in Ukrainian hands), counting those who fought for Russia within any rank, are close to the Ukrainian estimate (about 400 thousand - which should in fact be the estimate of irretrievable losses, despite the fact that many people, including Ukrainian officials, keep claiming otherwise).\n\nAs for UALosses, I take a look at it sometimes. In general, it should be legit and the place of death of the fallen soldiers almost always reflect the location of deployment of a unit at a given time, and to a lesser extent also the geographic origin of soldiers based on the area brigades usually recruit from (this is particularly true for TDF brigades). However, there are several errors that undermine its full reliability; I recall finding a few duplicates or minor errors such as a KIA from the 42nd Motorized Battalion (57th Motorized Brigade) classified as a KIA from the 42nd Mechanized Brigade (if I recall correctly).",

Over the last months, sometimes a dozen, other times 20ish and up to 40 obituaries of fallen servicemen from Wagner PMC (who fell largely in the Bakhmut/Soledar campaign) are still published every week.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, by Mediazona&#39;s estimate the number of fallen convicts would rise from 8 thousand (confirmed) to 19 thousand (estimated). But if we recall that per Wagner sources 15 thousand convicts had died within their ranks, it&#39;s implausible that only 4 thousand convicts died over the last year in the ranks of Storm-Z/V units. Although convicts are indeed the category for which it&#39;s most difficult to find reports confirming their deaths. </p>\n\n<p>My personal estimate is that Russia&#39;s irretrievable losses (dead, missing, wounded permanently unable to serve, POWs currently in Ukrainian hands), counting those who fought for Russia within any rank, are close to the Ukrainian estimate (about 400 thousand - which should in fact be the estimate of irretrievable losses, despite the fact that many people, including Ukrainian officials, keep claiming otherwise).</p>\n\n<p>As for UALosses, I take a look at it sometimes. In general, it should be legit and the place of death of the fallen soldiers almost always reflect the location of deployment of a unit at a given time, and to a lesser extent also the geographic origin of soldiers based on the area brigades usually recruit from (this is particularly true for TDF brigades). However, there are several errors that undermine its full reliability; I recall finding a few duplicates or minor errors such as a KIA from the 42nd Motorized Battalion (57th Motorized Brigade) classified as a KIA from the 42nd Mechanized Brigade (if I recall correctly).</p>\n</div>",

After these militants killed three Americans in Jordan in January, the US carried out a strike inside Baghdad on February 7 that killed two key militia commanders. The attacks have since stopped entirely, the Pentagon has said. Officials also believe Iran instructed the groups to back off the attacks following the US strikes.\n\n\n\nBy reading some of the arguments here where people really expecting this to end in 6 weeks or 6 months?

After these militants killed three Americans in Jordan in January, the US carried out a strike inside Baghdad on February 7 that killed two key militia commanders.

But as long as they attack our ships (ours, meaning not Israeli), we have no choice but to defend ourselves.</p>\n</div>",
