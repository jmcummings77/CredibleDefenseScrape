This is an area that's been under the domination of two foreign empires (Austrian and Ottoman) for centuries, where people have moved around, or been forcefully displaced, on ethnic, religious, political and economic ground for generations. There are ethnic and religious enclaves all over the place; even in the nominally Serbian Republica Srpska you can find yourself in a largely Croatian village, and you walk to the nearest village which is like three kilometers away, and everyone's Bosniak. There is no way to draw a single line along ethnic boundaries, and even if you somehow draw it, there's always going to be a minoritary, but substantial amount of people of one ethnicity stuck on the other side of the line.\n\nThis is one of the things that made the Yugoslav wars so bloody and so difficult to control.

There are ethnic and religious enclaves all over the place; even in the nominally Serbian Republica Srpska you can find yourself in a largely Croatian village, and you walk to the nearest village which is like three kilometers away, and everyone&#39;s Bosniak.

Ukraine might need to bypass some defenses on Russian soil or strike some targets within Russia to gain an upper hand. By upping the strikes in Russia in a piece-meal fashion it potentially limits the backlash from both Russia and Ukraine's allies.

                            "body": "4000 is purely a paper figure for demonstration purposes, I'm not advocating that Russia actually build 4000 tanks or that they will ultimately build 4000, they could build 15,000 over 30 years, that would make it one of the most successful tank lines in history, it's also outlandish and extremely unlikely.   \n\n\nWhatever they choose to build, it's going to start off with small volume and a long period of ramping production, likely settling somewhere around 300-500 vehicles a year, that's reasonable if you take into account their existing capacity. \n\n  \nRather 4000 tanks is the figure I feel Russia is capable of producing between now and the next major conflict. Russia seems to go approximately 10 years between shitstorms and 4000 tanks produced over a 10 year timespan seems reasonable enough for a country coming off the back of a wartime MIC industrial boom that's already demonstrated it will funnel money into arms development and procurement at the expense of nearly everything else. This war has been a rude awakening for a country that happily sat on its \"great soviet arsenal\" at the expense of producing new equipment in any meaningful volume, that arsenal largely doesn't exist in the same manner it did pre-war (arguably it hasn't existed in the way they thought it had since the early 90s, many of these vehicles were scrapped in obscurity but remained \"on paper\" in the mindspace, but hey ho). Ontop of this foreign export orders of the T90 have all but dried up, so they will now have to switch gears if they want to keep those orders flowing.  \n\n\nI'm not entirely sure that 4000 tanks are necessary in the currently evolving battlespace as infantry and drone delivered arms are showing that heavy armour has more or less been outpaced by anti armour weaponry and tactics. Tanks still have a place on the battlefield, but that place has been significantly diminished since the heyday of the Soviet Union when a tank class would see 20,000 units produced without a sweat. \n\n  \nAlso 10-15 years of peacetime go by in a flash. We're assuming that their production capacity remains near constant here, which it wouldn't, it would ramp up and down based on procurement orders, they're demonstrating right now that they've got no problems surging the workforce to meet demands, if they're even half as focused on production in tertiary industries then keeping an assembly line supplied wouldn't be a problem. ***(The tanks might be rolling off with empty optics ports, missing thermals and computers, but that wouldn't exactly be the first time Russia rolled tanks off the line without half of the tank).***\n\n  \nYou're right that tooling is an issue, but it's not an insurmountable issue compared to the litany of other challenges they've had to face in prosecuting this war. Also whilst tooling is important, Russia isn't some hapless country, they're highly skilled in metal working, milling and machinery construction, it's one of their largest industries and whilst international sanctions will definitely make things difficult, it's not an impossible challenge and they've already shown they're capable of (atleast temporarily) evading these sanctions.  \n\n\nAs far as I'm aware they already had much of the tooling to produce T-14s but lacked the machinery and assembly line (apologies for the confusion, I was lopping it all under \"tooling\" but in hindsight it's probably better to refer to the latter as machinery) to produce the T-14 in any meaningful volume.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>4000 is purely a paper figure for demonstration purposes, I&#39;m not advocating that Russia actually build 4000 tanks or that they will ultimately build 4000, they could build 15,000 over 30 years, that would make it one of the most successful tank lines in history, it&#39;s also outlandish and extremely unlikely.   </p>\n\n<p>Whatever they choose to build, it&#39;s going to start off with small volume and a long period of ramping production, likely settling somewhere around 300-500 vehicles a year, that&#39;s reasonable if you take into account their existing capacity. </p>\n\n<p>Rather 4000 tanks is the figure I feel Russia is capable of producing between now and the next major conflict. Russia seems to go approximately 10 years between shitstorms and 4000 tanks produced over a 10 year timespan seems reasonable enough for a country coming off the back of a wartime MIC industrial boom that&#39;s already demonstrated it will funnel money into arms development and procurement at the expense of nearly everything else. This war has been a rude awakening for a country that happily sat on its &quot;great soviet arsenal&quot; at the expense of producing new equipment in any meaningful volume, that arsenal largely doesn&#39;t exist in the same manner it did pre-war (arguably it hasn&#39;t existed in the way they thought it had since the early 90s, many of these vehicles were scrapped in obscurity but remained &quot;on paper&quot; in the mindspace, but hey ho). Ontop of this foreign export orders of the T90 have all but dried up, so they will now have to switch gears if they want to keep those orders flowing.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure that 4000 tanks are necessary in the currently evolving battlespace as infantry and drone delivered arms are showing that heavy armour has more or less been outpaced by anti armour weaponry and tactics. Tanks still have a place on the battlefield, but that place has been significantly diminished since the heyday of the Soviet Union when a tank class would see 20,000 units produced without a sweat. </p>\n\n<p>Also 10-15 years of peacetime go by in a flash. We&#39;re assuming that their production capacity remains near constant here, which it wouldn&#39;t, it would ramp up and down based on procurement orders, they&#39;re demonstrating right now that they&#39;ve got no problems surging the workforce to meet demands, if they&#39;re even half as focused on production in tertiary industries then keeping an assembly line supplied wouldn&#39;t be a problem. <strong><em>(The tanks might be rolling off with empty optics ports, missing thermals and computers, but that wouldn&#39;t exactly be the first time Russia rolled tanks off the line without half of the tank).</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re right that tooling is an issue, but it&#39;s not an insurmountable issue compared to the litany of other challenges they&#39;ve had to face in prosecuting this war. Also whilst tooling is important, Russia isn&#39;t some hapless country, they&#39;re highly skilled in metal working, milling and machinery construction, it&#39;s one of their largest industries and whilst international sanctions will definitely make things difficult, it&#39;s not an impossible challenge and they&#39;ve already shown they&#39;re capable of (atleast temporarily) evading these sanctions.  </p>\n\n<p>As far as I&#39;m aware they already had much of the tooling to produce T-14s but lacked the machinery and assembly line (apologies for the confusion, I was lopping it all under &quot;tooling&quot; but in hindsight it&#39;s probably better to refer to the latter as machinery) to produce the T-14 in any meaningful volume. Uralvagonzavod was already partially paid for this which is why they have the existing demonstration and prototype units on-top of the additional training units that were seen out in Kazan (that are now currently hiding behind a building somewhere in Ukraine).  </p>\n\n<p>The Russian government only partly funded the production line, so they were left in a state of limbo, there was big talk of &quot;automation&quot; equipment leading from 2017 through till around 2020 but realistically speaking that was probably all propaganda-speak whilst the company was being kept in procurement hell by the RUAF.

They could always change up targets and avoid the very limited coverage of Patriot.   \n\n\nAnd each of those interceptions comes at a cost of $4.1M a piece, assuming a 100% effective interception rate, with only 250 of those missiles being produced yearly. (Production of PAC-3MSE is set to rise to 500 per year by 2025+, but this is with the backdrop of many other partners coming online with initial inventory requirements that will keep the production line busy for the next decade, let alone the immediate short term of this conflict).   \n\n\nWhilst they are incredibly effective, they're also too costly to be deployed in such a way as to completely negate Iskanders effectiveness across a country the size of Ukraine, they're limited to focusing ballistic protection around Kyiv for practicality reasons. Presuming production remains relatively constrained relative to the rate of interceptions (hard to tell if Russia will continue throwing shit at Kyiv at this heightened rate) we're going to gradually approach a point at which MSE availability in theater is also constrained.   \n\n\nUS has approximately 1600 PAC-3MSE's available in inventory, we do know that they have sent some of these MSE's to Ukraine although we don't know precisely how many. The existing inventory may have already been significantly impacted by donations. Wreckage fragments indicate it's been the MSE (cue Scooby doo unmasking) intercepting Khinzal.

        "body": "[Why Putin Is Right to Fear for His Life](https://time.com/6280869/vladimir-putin-russia-assassination/)  \n\n> Roman Emperor Domitian is remembered for only one joke. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing to be an emperor,\u201d Domitian said, \u201cbecause everything thinks your paranoia about being assassinated is groundless\u2014until you\u2019re actually murdered!\u201d Soon after Domitian was assassinated. Extreme vigilance is the essential mood of tyranny, which must inhabit that condition not just first because it is indeed in danger of overthrow and surrounded by enemies but also because it requires its people to be fearful and isolated, therefore conditioned for extreme solutions. President Vladimir Putin is living proof of this conundrum.\n> \n> The recent drone attack on the Kremlin may have been the work of Ukrainian or internal Russian factions, possibly within his own wider security organs, or a \u2018false flag\u2019 operation by the regime itself, but it was inevitable that the dictatorship would claim it was an assassination attempt on Putin. This is absurd since everyone knows that the president does not live in the Kremlin but outside Moscow in his gilded mansion, Novo-Ogaryovo. Yet Domitian would sympathize because Putin has every reason to fear assassination.\n> \n> It is a clich\u00e9 of the clich\u00e9-ridden Western press on Putin\u2014and his predecessors Stalin, Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible\u2014that they are paranoid to the extent of madness. It is a clich\u00e9 that ignores and misunderstands the nature of dictatorship particularly in Russia. All absolute systems in world history depend on coercion to crush opposition and maintain power, thereby creating internal enemies who can only use violence to overthrow the ruler. All such systems deploy war and xenophobia to inspire and control their own people which creates another legion of enemies. The Western press always emphasizes the omnipotence of the autocrat in a system without limits without seeing that a system without limits means the leader exists in a permanent state of carnivorous chaos without any real or lasting security. Systems without clear rules of succession grant enormous power to the ruler but also mean they have no means of retirement. In Russia\u2014whether under Tsars Ivan IV and Peter I , Stalin or Putin\u2014rulers could appoint their successors but could never do so without creating a potential present menace.\n> \n> In October 2011, during the Arab Spring revolutions, Putin spent hours watching the gruesome smartphone footage of longterm Russian ally, Colonel Gadaffi, who was sodomized with a bayonet before being shot. Putin resolved to save his ally, Bashar al-Assad in Syria. And himself. He no doubt reflected on the nature of Russian tsardom. He was aware of it from the start: when Yeltsin offered him the presidency in 1999, Putin hesitated, asking \u201chow will I protect my family?\u201d The answer? To establish a dictatorship and keep it for life.  \n> \n> Every wise tsar knows that his constant poise must be ferocious vigilance. Peter the Great set the standard of the all-talented emperor and supreme commander to which Putin\u2014along with every other Russian ruler\u2014aspires but he faced constant plots against his life which he handled himself by personally torturing and executing thousands of mutinous musketeers; he even tortured his own rebellions son Alexei to death. Peter invented modern Russia\u2014even its name Roosiya was coined by him\u2014as a new empire; he took the title imperator. The state has never developed from that vision. But this imperial self-image also sets a perilous standard for Peter\u2019s admiring successors: the tsar \u2013 whether president or general-secretary\u2014is also a military commander.\n> \n> If a Russian ruler cannot dominate the \u201cRussian world,\u201d he will disappoint history. Peter was overwhelmingly successful in his wars\u2014but even he was nearly captured and defeated by the Ottomans. Yet the dream of every Russian ruler is conquest. In 1904, Nicholas II\u2019s Interior Minister V.K. Plehve, supposedly advised, \u201cWhat this country needs is a short victorious war.\u201d Every ruler (even in our democracies) aspires to one of those. Nicholas II instead faced a disastrous defeat vs Japan; but Putin built his imperial presidency and garnished his swaggersome overconfidence with a run of three \u2018short victorious wars\u2019 in Chechnya, Georgia and Syria. But they were minor skirmishes; Ukraine is proving very different\u2026\n> \n> Out of the last twelve Romanov emperors, six died violently. Ivan the Terrible and Stalin died in their beds by wreaking such havoc around them that no one dared destroy them. Putin is a killer but not yet a mass killer on their scale.  \n> \n> In June 1762, the new young Emperor Peter III\u2014puny grandson of Great Peter\u2014threw away costly Russian gains against Prussia. His own Guards and his wife Catherine the Great overthrew him; the Guards strangled him. The press release announced he had died of haemorrhoids.

He is not an intellectual like Stalin but he reads historical biographies\u2014including a famous Russian biography of Paul and my own biography of Catherine the Great and Potemkin.

When I wrote that first book in 2ooo, Putin, waiting for it to be translated, asked for a one-pager on Potemkin\u2019s conquests and cities.

When his troops took Kherson, they captured Potemkin\u2019s tomb and when they retreated late last year, they stole the Prince\u2019s body.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://time.com/6280869/vladimir-putin-russia-assassination/\">Why Putin Is Right to Fear for His Life</a>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roman Emperor Domitian is remembered for only one joke. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing to be an emperor,\u201d Domitian said, \u201cbecause everything thinks your paranoia about being assassinated is groundless\u2014until you\u2019re actually murdered!\u201d Soon after Domitian was assassinated. Extreme vigilance is the essential mood of tyranny, which must inhabit that condition not just first because it is indeed in danger of overthrow and surrounded by enemies but also because it requires its people to be fearful and isolated, therefore conditioned for extreme solutions. President Vladimir Putin is living proof of this conundrum.</p>\n\n<p>The recent drone attack on the Kremlin may have been the work of Ukrainian or internal Russian factions, possibly within his own wider security organs, or a \u2018false flag\u2019 operation by the regime itself, but it was inevitable that the dictatorship would claim it was an assassination attempt on Putin. This is absurd since everyone knows that the president does not live in the Kremlin but outside Moscow in his gilded mansion, Novo-Ogaryovo. Yet Domitian would sympathize because Putin has every reason to fear assassination.</p>\n\n<p>It is a clich\u00e9 of the clich\u00e9-ridden Western press on Putin\u2014and his predecessors Stalin, Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible\u2014that they are paranoid to the extent of madness. It is a clich\u00e9 that ignores and misunderstands the nature of dictatorship particularly in Russia. All absolute systems in world history depend on coercion to crush opposition and maintain power, thereby creating internal enemies who can only use violence to overthrow the ruler. All such systems deploy war and xenophobia to inspire and control their own people which creates another legion of enemies. The Western press always emphasizes the omnipotence of the autocrat in a system without limits without seeing that a system without limits means the leader exists in a permanent state of carnivorous chaos without any real or lasting security. Systems without clear rules of succession grant enormous power to the ruler but also mean they have no means of retirement. In Russia\u2014whether under Tsars Ivan IV and Peter I , Stalin or Putin\u2014rulers could appoint their successors but could never do so without creating a potential present menace.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2011, during the Arab Spring revolutions, Putin spent hours watching the gruesome smartphone footage of longterm Russian ally, Colonel Gadaffi, who was sodomized with a bayonet before being shot. Putin resolved to save his ally, Bashar al-Assad in Syria. And himself. He no doubt reflected on the nature of Russian tsardom. He was aware of it from the start: when Yeltsin offered him the presidency in 1999, Putin hesitated, asking \u201chow will I protect my family?\u201d The answer? To establish a dictatorship and keep it for life.  </p>\n\n<p>Every wise tsar knows that his constant poise must be ferocious vigilance. Peter the Great set the standard of the all-talented emperor and supreme commander to which Putin\u2014along with every other Russian ruler\u2014aspires but he faced constant plots against his life which he handled himself by personally torturing and executing thousands of mutinous musketeers; he even tortured his own rebellions son Alexei to death. Peter invented modern Russia\u2014even its name Roosiya was coined by him\u2014as a new empire; he took the title imperator. The state has never developed from that vision. But this imperial self-image also sets a perilous standard for Peter\u2019s admiring successors: the tsar \u2013 whether president or general-secretary\u2014is also a military commander.</p>\n\n<p>If a Russian ruler cannot dominate the \u201cRussian world,\u201d he will disappoint history. Peter was overwhelmingly successful in his wars\u2014but even he was nearly captured and defeated by the Ottomans. Yet the dream of every Russian ruler is conquest. In 1904, Nicholas II\u2019s Interior Minister V.K. Plehve, supposedly advised, \u201cWhat this country needs is a short victorious war.\u201d Every ruler (even in our democracies) aspires to one of those. Nicholas II instead faced a disastrous defeat vs Japan; but Putin built his imperial presidency and garnished his swaggersome overconfidence with a run of three \u2018short victorious wars\u2019 in Chechnya, Georgia and Syria. But they were minor skirmishes; Ukraine is proving very different\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Out of the last twelve Romanov emperors, six died violently. Ivan the Terrible and Stalin died in their beds by wreaking such havoc around them that no one dared destroy them. Putin is a killer but not yet a mass killer on their scale.  </p>\n\n<p>In June 1762, the new young Emperor Peter III\u2014puny grandson of Great Peter\u2014threw away costly Russian gains against Prussia. His own Guards and his wife Catherine the Great overthrew him; the Guards strangled him. The press release announced he had died of haemorrhoids. When Catherine later invited the French philosopher d\u2019Alembert to Russia, he joked \u201cI must decline because I suffer from haemorrhoids which are a fatal disease in Russia.\u201d After midnight, on 11th March 1801, Russian Emperor, Paul, son of Catherine and Peter III, was awakened by footsteps on the stairs of his Mikhailovsky Castle; he hid behind a tapestry as the conspirators\u2014slightly drunk after a pre-homicidal champagne\u2014burst into his bedroom.</p>\n\n<p>The conspirators were let in by trusted servant; they were led by his chief minister &amp; top generals; and backed by his own son, who waited downstairs. What happened next was history\u2019s most savage liquidation of a Russian autocrat.</p>\n\n<p>Paul, inconsistent and menacing, was destroyed by war , capricious foreign policy\u2014including sending an army to attack British India.

This may take some time to explain but IMO is very relevant; you might want to spend some time making it more concise. Anyways, here's a domain-specific example:\n\n- Some border states such as Finland consider their electric grid maps as confidential security information [note: not just where the lines are, that part is possible to compile from open sources, but their capacities (which you can't practically measure w/o insider access because it is a little unsafe to stick a voltmeter in a 400kV line)].  Referencing the [latest RUSI report](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/preliminary-lessons-russias-unconventional-operations-during-russo-ukrainian-war-february-2022), it appears that such information was likely compromised in Ukraine due to Soviet legacy data and compromised electric/nuclear infrastructure leaders, and allowed Russia to better target the grid's power transfer bottlenecks in its winter campaign.\n\n- The EU is considering a data sharing platform that might pass this information between the different member states' grid operators.\n\n- For example Luxembourg's grid operator is [partially under Chinese ownership](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-encevo-m-a-cn-sthrn-pwr-idUSKBN1KL1V8) due to accepting Belt and Road investments.\n\n- China may have access to other forms of sensitive infrastructure data from BRI investments, and in general, intra-EU data sharing may result in access even from countries that have so far had a policy of confidentiality.\n\nSo: in light of China's \"unlimited partnership\" with Russia, how concerned do we need to be that Chinese investments result in sensitive European critical infrastructure data being shared with Russians and used for military planning? What kinds of policy changes are necessary for mitigating this risk? And (for the Confucius institute person) how can/will China address these concerns to maintain its level of investments?",

They will be the prefrontal cortices that control many other subsystems.</p>\n\n<p>Anecdotally you can easily imagine LLM and image/video uses for PSYOPs (think the fake Pentagon on fire image we saw recently). There are incredible near-term uses for training and cyber warfare as well.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone knows of good forums for discussing this in depth please let me know, as most of the subreddits I&#39;ve found are only scratching the surface of the broader implications of LLMs.</p>\n</div>",

There isn't a clear distinction between \"AI that helps with decisions\" and \"AI that does robot stuff.\" Most current ML functions as decision support ultimately, with many systems incrementally reducing the role of the human in the loop as the underlying algorithms improve from that human feedback. E.g., if you have a model that identifies S-300 systems in drone imagery, currently that might be used to reduce the burden on intel officers to review lots of drone imagery. But it's really only a small step from there to giving the drone fire authority to target S-300s on its own, taking the human out of the loop altogether. So on one end of the spectrum of AI autonomy, you could have a system where AI isn't used at all and everything remains under human control. In the middle you might have one where it is used to process raw information in larger quantities than humans reasonably could in order to highlight items of interest for human review. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, there might be a system where the AI plans and executes its own missions from launch to RTB.\n\nAs something of an aside, I would certainly say that there is a lot of understandable skittishness both in the DoD and the larger defense space around the ethics of taking the human out of the loop. It is quite dissimilar from finance in that poor decisions can result in the loss of innocent lives and may even constitute war crimes under some circumstances. So the stakes are higher to hand over the reins to a purely quantitative model.\n\nIn any case, I think you will see many small, niche applications for AI start to permeate DoD practices and procedures over the next few years. That will let the services build bottoms-up trust in the systems while giving commanders time to acquire fluency with the rapidly changing technologies in the space. Once a large number of these ML algorithms are in place, ensembling algorithms (basically meta-algorithms for combining multiple distinct models to a single problem) will build up an additional layer of abstraction over the discrete task algorithms like object detectors or predictive maintenance models to allow for more complex analyses. e.g., you could have a model for predicting force availability under a certain set of hypothetical conditions, and one of the inputs to or subcomponents of that model would be a predictive maintenance model for each of the force's major pieces of equipment, which can inform downtime estimates. Then you'll start to see real progress on the operational/strategic level with improved decision support algorithms that can be used in real world scenarios to help staff planning in actual combat while also being used to inform large scale simulations for peacetime wargaming.\n\nProbably worth noting that current wargaming practices are really not very structured. They are typically not video games, although they may be informed by software or quantitative models. They are conducted primarily as table top exercises refereed by experts. So it's going to be a long time until those processes are well-informed by real world data.\n\nNot least of all because unlike financial markets, wars are not (thankfully) daily activities for the most part. And they often occur under unique circumstances, making it hard to draw generalizable conclusions from data, simply because the underlying datasets are almost always extremely biased. To once again take the example of the S-300 detector, even if the US were able to develop one based on data collected from the current conflict in Ukraine, there is no guarantee that the detector would work on even slightly different terrain. Now take that minor discrepancy and apply it to the trillions of other dimensions needed to specify a battlespace. Look at how long it is taking to get self-driving cars working. And that's a much better defined problem set, with simple ways of generating or acquiring training data that don't require a war to break out somewhere.

If you are looking for truly complete answer you should read \"Taliban: Story of the Afghan Warlord\" by Ahmed Rashid and/or \"Ghost Wars\" By Steve Coll.\n\nThe very TL:DR answer is that nether \"the Mujahideen\" or \"the Taliban\" are united organizations but rather both are/were a loosely tied coalition of hundreds of milita groups divided across religious, culture, tribal, ethic and political lines. After the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan, the various milita groups which made up \"The Mujahideen\", almost immediately began fighting each other, as without a common enemy there was really nothing to unite them, and the whole country entered a full scale civil war in 1994.\n\nThe Taliban was founded in Pakistan during this period by ex-mujahideen fighters from\"Hezb-i Islami Khalis\" a milita group which was part of \"The Mujahideen\" ,most notably Muhammad Omar and Abdul Ghani Baradar. Some of the fighters they recruited were also ex-mujahideen who had fought the soviets, however most of them were recruited from camps for Afghan refuges who had fled to Pakistan during the Soviet- Afghan war. As one could guess this was a prime place to radicalize or find already radicalized Afghans as many of the people in those camps where young men who had been forced to flee Afghanistan when they were children. Remembering also that 7 million Afghans were made refuges by the Soviet-Afghan war, it becomes easy to see why they were able to gain so many followers.",

            "body": "The US never provided weapons to the Taliban. They provided weapons to the Mujahideen who were a loose network of competing anti communist, often Islamic fundamentalist, anti-soviet forces. The Mujahideen were the primary actors in the war against the Soviet Union, which they ultimately won in the early 1990s. As a fun fact, the Soviet backed government in Kabul outlived the Soviet government in Moscow. After the Soviet withdraw from Afghanistan, US aid stopped though Pakistani aid did not and often used similar channels, indeed the ISI had been the vector through which a good chunk of US aid had flown in the first place. After the collapse of the Kabul government, the Mujahideen splintered and a second civil war began over who would rule the aftermath. \n\nThe word Taliban literally means \u2018students,\u2019 highlight the groups origins. It was formed in the refugee camps located in Pakistan who attended a common madrassa, or school, run by Mullah Omar.  In 1992 Omar and his students are relocated to his home province of Kandahar where Omar became increasingly frustrated that, despite the collapse of the Communist government, the new Mujahideen government in his area had not implemented Islamic law. By 1994 he had recruited over 10k more students, nearly all of them teenagers, and had become an active belligerent in the civil war. Without American aid the other factions quickly exhausted themselves with their infighting, so the young, energetic, and traditionalist Taliban were able to roll right over the disparate factions. The Taliban were also clever, rather than trying to establish one centralized state they accepted local autonomy so long as the government shared the tradtionalist Islamic bent. This meant that, when they weren\u2019t killed, former Mujahideen were rehabilitated into the Taliban government, *in some places.* The northern alliance never bought into the Taliban regime, and successfully resisted for years before the American invasion. But everywhere else the Taliban were able to either break the disconnected resistance of their rivals, or co-opt them and force them into a client relationship. \n\nAfter the 2001 invasion the Taliban were removed from power, and many returned to Pakistan. The US campaign managed to kill much of the old leadership and imposed on Afghanistan a more or less secular dictatorship (quasi-democracy?) which ruled from Kabul at the point of an American rifle. The best way to think of Afghanistan, IMO, is a nation linked by their shared rejection of a common identity (unlike the other -stans, Afghanistan is also unique in that Afghani is a nationality, not an ethnicity). So at this point a domestic resistance to Kabul and the US/NATO arose which linked both resistance fighters and the Taliban together. Both groups shared aims and came to see eye to eye on many things, I clouding the fact that the Kabul government was too secular, liberal, and close to the Americans to be acceptable. The Taliban, who rule through decentralized fundamentalism, were much better. So as troops began to leave Afghanistan the Taliban was able to come in and assume much of the burden of resistance. There were sources of resistance to the Taliban, who are not in themselves especially popular (again, most Afghanis hate whoever is in Kabul), for example ISIS maintains a strong presence in Afghanistan and should highlight resistance to Taliban rule. But the US for obvious reasons could never tap this and other anti-Taliban resistance groups. Which only helped to consolidate their power. By 2015/2016 Afghanistan was set on the course of another major round of fighting, as US troops withdrew the Taliban infiltrated and conquered more and more territories making Kabuls ability to govern the whole pie tenuous. As the Taliban proved they could return, non-Taliban resistance consolidated behind them and was often rewarded with toleration and autonomy. What happened next, we\u2019ll I guess you\u2019d know.\n\nBut I want to stress one thing. By the timeline it should be obvious that the US never gave weapons to the Taliban. They may have took weapons, or been give them by the ISI using left over anti-Soviet funds (tho I doubt this). There has also been the claim I have seen, tho never substantiated, that some of their madrassas were funded with US humanitarian relief funds. But in terms of lethal aid, it\u2019s an impossibility because US lethal aid ended nearly half a decade *before* the Taliban formed. Mullah Omar was (likely) not even if Afghanistan when US aid ended.\n\n*quick edit:* Sorry I should say, Omar himself was a Mujahideen but a relatively minor player. Not even a regional commander, I think he legit had like fifty guys at his height. But he bailed on Afghanistan in the mid-80s to set up a school in Pakistan which is where he got plugged into the madrassa community there. It\u2019s hard to build a good timeline because so much of his life at this time was poorly recorded, because he lied about it repeatedly, and because his family and friends repeatedly contradicted him regarding those lies.",
