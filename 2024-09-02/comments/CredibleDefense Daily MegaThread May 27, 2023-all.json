The [engines in the Shahed](https://www.militarydrones.org.cn/md-550-engine-price-p00583p1.html) are indeed relatively simple 4 cylinder boxers, smallish, but everything in their casting and assembly line is going to be set up for much bigger units. That's a problem. Converting would involve a lot of retooling effort.\n\nThe engine is also just one part of the Shahed.

Microsoft said the hacking group, which it dubbed Volt Typhoon, had breached government, communications, manufacturing and IT organizations in the US and Guam, a crucial military post in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n>While the identities of most of the hacking victims remains unknown, US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told CNBC on Thursday that the Navy was impacted by the intrusions. The extent of the breach wasn\u2019t immediately known. A spokesperson for the US Navy declined to \u201cdiscuss the status of our networks.\u201d\n\n>Meanwhile, Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, told CNN Thursday that Chinese hackers could still have access to sensitive US networks that they\u2019ve targeted. Joyce said the intrusions stood out in how brazen they were in \u201cscope and scale.\u201d\n\n>A NSA representative declined to comment and referred instead to a release by the NSA and other US agencies on the Chinese hacking group. \n\n>Microsoft said it had \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d the breaches were carried out in preparation to upend communications in the event of a future crisis. The company\u2019s disclosure came amid mounting concerns that China might take military action to enforce its claim to the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n>Jon Darby, NSA\u2019s director of operations until his retirement after 39 years at the spy agency in August, said the operation matched a well-known way to infiltrate networks by accessing them at the edges rather than at what he called the bulls-eye and then staying undetected for years.\n\n>\u201cThe interesting thing is they got in from home routers all the way into the US Navy infrastructure,\u201d said Darby, who is not familiar with the details of this specific case. \n\n>\u201cThe scary thing is they could then launch disruptive or destructive attacks when things are hitting the fan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re in these networks they can wreak havoc. You\u2019ve got to identify and plug up the vulnerabilities that allowed them to get into these networks and eradicate them.\u201d\n\n>The NSA, along with intelligence agencies from the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada also shared more details on the hackers. Those countries are all part of a key intelligence alliance, which includes the sharing of cybersecurity information, known as the Five Eyes. \n\n>China has denied the hacking accusations.\n\n>\u201cWe noted this extremely unprofessional report \u2013 a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cApparently, this has been a collective disinformation campaign launched by the US through the Five Eyes to serve its geopolitical agenda. It\u2019s widely known that the Five Eyes is the world\u2019s biggest intelligence association, and the NSA the world\u2019s biggest hacking group.\u201d\n\n>The US has previously accused Chinese hackers for espionage and intellectual property theft, including a data breach of the Office of Personnel Management in 2015 and a hack of Equifax in 2017. In 2014, a Senate panel found that Chinese government-affiliated hackers accessed the data of military contractors including airlines and tech companies.\n\n>It\u2019s not clear why Microsoft, the US and its allies decided to shine a spotlight on the hacking group this week.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-26/us-navy-hit-by-chinese-hacking-campaign-in-pacific-report-says\">US Navy Hit by Chinese Hacking Campaign, Report Says</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>China denies \u2018unprofessional\u2019 accusation from US, Microsoft</li>\n<li>Hackers hit targets in US and Guam, a key military outpost</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An alleged campaign by Chinese state-sponsored hackers on targets in the US and Guam has raised fears that Beijing is preparing to disrupt communications in the Pacific in the event of a conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The hacking campaign was first identified by Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday and quickly confirmed by authorities in the US, UK and other allied nations. Microsoft said the hacking group, which it dubbed Volt Typhoon, had breached government, communications, manufacturing and IT organizations in the US and Guam, a crucial military post in the western Pacific Ocean.</p>\n\n<p>While the identities of most of the hacking victims remains unknown, US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told CNBC on Thursday that the Navy was impacted by the intrusions. The extent of the breach wasn\u2019t immediately known. A spokesperson for the US Navy declined to \u201cdiscuss the status of our networks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, told CNN Thursday that Chinese hackers could still have access to sensitive US networks that they\u2019ve targeted. Joyce said the intrusions stood out in how brazen they were in \u201cscope and scale.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A NSA representative declined to comment and referred instead to a release by the NSA and other US agencies on the Chinese hacking group. </p>\n\n<p>Microsoft said it had \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d the breaches were carried out in preparation to upend communications in the event of a future crisis. The company\u2019s disclosure came amid mounting concerns that China might take military action to enforce its claim to the self-ruled island of Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Darby, NSA\u2019s director of operations until his retirement after 39 years at the spy agency in August, said the operation matched a well-known way to infiltrate networks by accessing them at the edges rather than at what he called the bulls-eye and then staying undetected for years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe interesting thing is they got in from home routers all the way into the US Navy infrastructure,\u201d said Darby, who is not familiar with the details of this specific case. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe scary thing is they could then launch disruptive or destructive attacks when things are hitting the fan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re in these networks they can wreak havoc. You\u2019ve got to identify and plug up the vulnerabilities that allowed them to get into these networks and eradicate them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The NSA, along with intelligence agencies from the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada also shared more details on the hackers. Those countries are all part of a key intelligence alliance, which includes the sharing of cybersecurity information, known as the Five Eyes. </p>\n\n<p>China has denied the hacking accusations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe noted this extremely unprofessional report \u2013 a patchwork with a broken chain of evidence,\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cApparently, this has been a collective disinformation campaign launched by the US through the Five Eyes to serve its geopolitical agenda. It\u2019s widely known that the Five Eyes is the world\u2019s biggest intelligence association, and the NSA the world\u2019s biggest hacking group.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The US has previously accused Chinese hackers for espionage and intellectual property theft, including a data breach of the Office of Personnel Management in 2015 and a hack of Equifax in 2017. In 2014, a Senate panel found that Chinese government-affiliated hackers accessed the data of military contractors including airlines and tech companies.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not clear why Microsoft, the US and its allies decided to shine a spotlight on the hacking group this week. One reason may be to give private companies a head start on defending from this group of Chinese hackers long before a potential conflict with China over Taiwan, said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant Intelligence, a subsidiary of Google. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe burden of protecting critical infrastructure from serious disruptive cyberattacks lies with the private sector.

From Facebook photos and twitter posts, just about everyone is mobile, but there\u2019s a lot of hummers and militarized SUVs to go with the mish mash of tanks/BMPs and a lot of 100mm AT guns to flesh out the artillery. \nBoth of the new Marine brigades and both of the new Air Assault brigades are composed of smaller legacy units, fleshed out with returning alumni and various veteran well wishers, and armed with mostly western equipment . Neither service\u2019s veteran units will supply troops to the offensive, having seen serious service over the winter (all remain on the line). \n\n-For the RA, the 7 brigades organized from November to February armed directly by Nato (The 21st OMB, 32nd OMB, 33rd OMB, 47th OMB, 116th OMB, 117thO MB and 118th OMB) are well and truly integrated, trained and outfitted.   Of the 10 brigades organized January/February, 5 brigades (the 22nd OMB, 23rd OMB, 31st OMB, 88th OMB and 13th Jaeger) have completed training- One of the brigades returned from Scandinavia without their gear, but the kick ass Swedish (and possibly Finnish/Norwegian ) equipment which will arguably make them the most  formidably armed unit in the entire theater has been publicly  in transit over the last two weeks.  The  reconstituted 5th Armor  is also newly deployable. 4 brigades  (the 41st-44th OMB) are still in training and won\u2019t be available for deployment before July, and I can\u2019t discern either the purpose or status of the 142nd reserve infantry.  \n\n-Discerning the veteran army brigades available for offensive action is less exact. All 4 of the veteran armor brigades have been deployed, but primarily as sector reserve forces, behind the line of contact.  All are a near full strength, well organized and available.

Going over them, it's a surprise that anyone still thinks his analysis is worthwhile. A few examples:\n\nJuly 5, 2022 - [Russia\u2019s Brutal War in the Donbas Proves Ukraine Can\u2019t Win](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/07/russias-brutal-war-in-the-donbas-proves-ukraine-cant-win/):\n\n> Today Kyiv still controls Kharkiv, Odessa, and still large portions of the Donetsk region. If the fighting continues, however, it is possible that by the end of the summer, some or all of those territories could fall to Russia. As anguishing as it may be for Kyiv to negotiate with Russia from its current disadvantaged position, it could well prove to be the best chance Ukraine has to maintain control over the majority of its territory over the long term.\n\n> No one but the Ukrainian people and government can make such a choice, but the harsh reality is that the more the UAF keeps fighting, the more likely it is that Russia expands its territorial control. \n\nJuly 29, 2022 - [Ukraine\u2019s Big \u2018Million Man\u2019 Offensive Against Russia Is a Mistake](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/07/ukraines-big-million-man-offensive-against-russia-seems-like-a-mistake/):\n\n>Virtually the only way Ukraine could succeed in an offensive against Russia in Kherson region at this time would be if they pulled a page out of the Soviet playbook from July 1943. In the Battle of Kursk, for example, the USSR was willing to throw over two million men into the meat grinder against the German Wehrmaht in a massive tank battle. The Soviet Union sacrificed 800,000 troops lost, but inflicted upwards of 200,000 casualties on the Germans in the process. \n***\n> Unless Ukraine is willing to sacrifice upwards of a million men \u2013 something the Russians may not be able to match, regardless of how many planes, tanks, and rockets they have \u2013 Zelensky\u2019s forces have no valid shot at driving Russia out of Kherson. \n\nAugust 6, 2022 - [Ukraine Needs a Miracle to Drive Russia\u2019s Military Out of Kherson](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/08/ukraine-needs-a-miracle-to-drive-russias-military-out-of-kherson/):\n\n> Realistically speaking, it is as close to impossible for Ukraine to successfully pull off an offensive in Kherson as can be imagined. As this analysis demonstrates, Ukraine wouldn\u2019t just need one miracle to succeed, they would need three. Betting the integrity and security of a country on going 3-for-3 in the miracle department may not be the best course. \n\nSeptember 7, 2022: [In Ukraine\u2019s Kherson Offensive, an Echo of a U.S. Military Fiasco: The 1944 Battle of Rapido River](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/09/in-ukraines-kherson-offensive-an-echo-of-a-u-s-military-fiasco-the-1944-battle-of-rapido-river/):\n\n> On August 29, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, after months of preparation, launched an offensive to retake the Kherson region from occupying Russian troops.  As many had warned in the weeks preceding the attack, there was no viable military path to victory for the Ukrainian offensive. The Ukraine military launched its attack anyway. Early independent assessments indicate the attack has indeed failed, and at a high cost in troops lost. \n\n***\n\nHe now says he sees things shifting in Russia's favor. But if you look at his writings, he's always thought things were in Russia's favor, in before major Ukrainian victories.",

As anguishing as it may be for Kyiv to negotiate with Russia from its current disadvantaged position, it could well prove to be the best chance Ukraine has to maintain control over the majority of its territory over the long term.</p>\n\n<p>No one but the Ukrainian people and government can make such a choice, but the harsh reality is that the more the UAF keeps fighting, the more likely it is that Russia expands its territorial control. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>July 29, 2022 - <a href=\"https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/07/ukraines-big-million-man-offensive-against-russia-seems-like-a-mistake/\">Ukraine\u2019s Big \u2018Million Man\u2019 Offensive Against Russia Is a Mistake</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Virtually the only way Ukraine could succeed in an offensive against Russia in Kherson region at this time would be if they pulled a page out of the Soviet playbook from July 1943. In the Battle of Kursk, for example, the USSR was willing to throw over two million men into the meat grinder against the German Wehrmaht in a massive tank battle. The Soviet Union sacrificed 800,000 troops lost, but inflicted upwards of 200,000 casualties on the Germans in the process. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Unless Ukraine is willing to sacrifice upwards of a million men \u2013 something the Russians may not be able to match, regardless of how many planes, tanks, and rockets they have \u2013 Zelensky\u2019s forces have no valid shot at driving Russia out of Kherson. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>August 6, 2022 - <a href=\"https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/08/ukraine-needs-a-miracle-to-drive-russias-military-out-of-kherson/\">Ukraine Needs a Miracle to Drive Russia\u2019s Military Out of Kherson</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Realistically speaking, it is as close to impossible for Ukraine to successfully pull off an offensive in Kherson as can be imagined. As this analysis demonstrates, Ukraine wouldn\u2019t just need one miracle to succeed, they would need three. Betting the integrity and security of a country on going 3-for-3 in the miracle department may not be the best course. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>September 7, 2022: <a href=\"https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/09/in-ukraines-kherson-offensive-an-echo-of-a-u-s-military-fiasco-the-1944-battle-of-rapido-river/\">In Ukraine\u2019s Kherson Offensive, an Echo of a U.S. Military Fiasco: The 1944 Battle of Rapido River</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On August 29, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, after months of preparation, launched an offensive to retake the Kherson region from occupying Russian troops.  As many had warned in the weeks preceding the attack, there was no viable military path to victory for the Ukrainian offensive. The Ukraine military launched its attack anyway. Early independent assessments indicate the attack has indeed failed, and at a high cost in troops lost. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>He now says he sees things shifting in Russia&#39;s favor. But if you look at his writings, he&#39;s always thought things were in Russia&#39;s favor, in before major Ukrainian victories.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Some really interesting figures on China-Russia trade, and on the surge in the output of the Russian defence sector.\n\n[**A Dead End for Russia\u2019s War Economy**](https://russiapost.info/society/war_economy)\n\nby Vadim Grishin (George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs)\n\nEven though in April 2023, the IMF raised its forecast for Russia's GDP growth from 0.3% to 0.7%, many sources indicate that this projection reflects a low-base effect from the previous year (when the country\u2019s GDP dropped by 2.1%) and could be misleading in a way that camouflages negative economic trends. Meanwhile, Moscow\u2019s \u201canomaly\u201d \u2013 better than expected performance in the face of the most extensive sanctions applied in modern history \u2013 has likely come to an end.\n\n...\n\nunbalanced bilateral economic cooperation with Beijing, and the high probability that the country\u2019s economy will be \"satellited\" by China, whose GDP is 10 times bigger than Russia's.
