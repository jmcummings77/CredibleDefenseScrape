Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Let me repost a comment I made a few days ago:\n\nIt's important to remember that there's active equipment used by the standing army and then there are reserves.\n\nFor example, let's have a look at tanks. The Military Balance 2022 report estimated that Russia had in total 2927 **active** main battle tanks. And Oryx says that so far they had suffered 3309 visually confirmed tank losses in Ukraine.\n\nThis means that, in terms of tanks, more than their *entire* 2022 standing army has been wiped out. And that they have been frantically pulling and regenerating tanks from reserve storage.\n\nWe often refer to the tanks in storage as \"hulls\", because the tanks in long-term storage in many cases have to be thoroughly refurbished, they're basically hull donors. The vast majority of Russian tank production reuses these stored hulls. On good days stored T-72 hulls are turned into T-90s and T-72B3Ms, on bad days you get something like T-72B Obr. 2022/2023/2024, which is an informal designation for the most budget versions, created because of the war.\n\nAnyway, my point is that the standing army can be rebuilt fairly quickly (a few years) by regenerating the stored equipment, as long as it exists. But those reserves are finite and they will never come back. Russia isn't the Soviet Union. They're not going to suddenly produce thousands of tanks/IFVs/howitzers/whatever from scratch just to put them in storage.\n\nI couldn't find reliable figures about the production of new tank **hulls**. IISS [has an estimate](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/military-balance/2024/06/russian-t-90m-production-less-than-meets-the-eye/) of 90 T-90Ms annually.

There've been some modern 155mm rounds, but the bulk is again, fairly normal ammunition. Patriot is from the 80s - Israel is actually phasing it out for another system. IRIS-T is the example of a really modern system that has been supplied in maximum numbers. New ones are rolling out as they come. The RCH-155 will be the same, once the first lot is being delivered. The rest was donations of old equipment and some soviet surplus laying around. \n\n\nBut I agree, it's better than what the standard available to russia is.

He was working as a security guard in a small Israeli kibbutz, called Magen, near the Gaza border, when he was abducted, according to a post on X from President Isaac Herzog of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/27/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war\">NY Times</a></p>\n\n<p>Qaid Farhan al-Qadi is the eight hostage that has been rescued alive and the first Arab-Israeli hostage, with at least four other Bedouins remaining in Hamas&#39; hands.</p>\n\n<p>With the negotiations still not leading anywhere, it seems like Israel is keeping the pressure on.</p>\n\n<p>No specifics from the operation yet, but apparently <a href=\"https://x.com/michaelh992/status/1828416769230274659\">he has been rescued from a tunnel</a>. This would mark a milestone; all other operations to free hostages have been conducted exclusively above ground. I wonder what circumstances have led to this opportunity, the other hostages are expected to be kept in the tunnels as well.</p>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://x.com/michaelh992/status/1828422076497002771\">pictures</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/K0sher_C0ckney/status/1828413938985263328\">videos</a> of al-Qadi have already been release, so I assume we can expect to see some (very much cut down) footage of the operation in the coming days.</p>\n</div>",

There is uncertainty about why Pokrovsk is more significant than other recently lost towns. This thread aims to clarify this and other aspects:\n\n>Before falling to Russian forces in February 2024, Avdiivka was vital for Ukrainian troops, serving as a fortress, protecting key logistical routes in Donetsk Oblast, and a potential foothold for deoccupying Donetsk. Since 2022, Russia has invested heavily in capturing it\n\n>Pokrovsk, with a pre-war population of ~60,000, lies west of Avdiivka at a key railroad crossroads. It has become a key distribution hub, supporting Ukrainian forces along a broad frontline from Vuhledar to the north of Donetsk and beyond. The railways are highlighted in red.\n\n>Currently, only two places in the Donbas serve this vital function - Pokrovsk and Kramatorsk. The significance of Pokrovsk extends beyond its rail connections - it is also located at a key road juncture, serving a similar role in the transportation and distribution of supplies\n\n>The road linking Pokrovsk to Kostyantynivka has long been a Russian target. Cutting it off would worsen the resupply of troops in the Bakhmut-Horlivka sector. The potential loss of Pokrovsk poses an operational threat to logistics in the region, from Vuhledar to Horlivka \n\n>Another concern is the political one: Pokrovsk is just over 20 kilometers from the Dnipro Oblast border. Given Russia's re-entry into Kharkiv Oblast in May 2024, there's little reason to think Putin will stop at Donetsk and Luhansk borders.\n\n>Since July, the pace of Russian advancement in this area has quickened, allowing them to bypass most of the defensive lines Ukraine rapidly built after Avdiivka\u2019s fall. This is visible on the map by OSINT group @Black_BirdGroup, which used satellite imagery to map defenses\n\n>Satellite imagery of seized UA positions shows signs of artillery shelling, though less extensive than in Ocheretyne. This likely indicates that Ukrainian troops in the Pokrovsk area retreated multiple times due to insufficient forces and resources for an organized defense \n\n>While concerns about the lack of fortifications behind Avdiivka are valid, the major issue is the shortage of manpower and units to defend them. Regardless of how well-constructed the defenses are, if they are staffed at only 10-20% of capacity, they likely will be lost \n\n>Typically, both Ukraine and Russia redeploy forces to stabilize critical areas by moving units from quieter sectors. Ukraine\u2019s redeployment to Kharkiv, and then Sumy for the Kursk operation has reduced the available units for stabilization efforts. \n\n>Does this mean that the loss of Pokrovsk is imminent? No, but the likelihood is increasing due to the balance of forces. Despite Ukrainian efforts to draw Russian forces away with the Kursk incursion, Russian leadership is hesitant to redeploy significant forces from Pokrovsk \n\n>Ukraine has options to stabilize the line, including deploying new brigades, repositioning forces from Kursk and Kharkiv, or reallocating battalions from more stable fronts.

Its just that Ukraine never gave them a good enough reason to try it after the lessons they learned in Kharkiv and Kherson.\n\nWhy would the country who originally intended to overthrow the Ukrainian government and essentially annex the entire country and has supposedly minimalist war aims of annexing four Ukrainian regions which they are far from being able to do so at the moment need a better reason to engage in manoeuvre warfare?\n\nIf the Russians were actually capable of competent manoeuvre warfare, they would have employed it in order to annex the four Ukrainian regions which Putin himself has stated are Russia's minimalist war aims. They fact the Russians are still bashing their heads into fortifications and advancing at glacial speeds whilst incurring completely unsustainable losses to the point they need to increase recruitment bonuses to absurd levels tells me the Russians are completely incapable of doing anything other than what they're doing now.\n\n>But once the Ukrainians evaporated their lines of the best troops for the Kursk invasion, the reason presented itself.\n\nWhat Russia is doing in Povrosk is not manoeuvre warfare. They are still advancing at a relatively slow pace. They are still incurring high losses and they are not doing anything even resembling \"manoeuvre warfare\". If this is the best Russia can muster up when Ukraine has diverted their best troops, a lot of their ammunition and have yet to fill their ranks with additional recruits and conscripts from the mobilisation bill then I fear Russia has a *very* long path ahead of it.\n\n>As to the psychological aspect, it is something I only ever really hear as a viable strategy from Slavic, namely post Soviet Russian/Ukrainians.

Maybe there have not been enough power outages yet, that does not mean it isnt possible. There is a limit to how many cruise missiles you are willing to try and fight off until you accept demands.\n\nThe Ukrainians, Polish, Estonians, Latvians and so on endured decades of Soviet oppression and far worse living conditions without much of a fuss. We've seen countless times throughout history that when it comes to an existential war, breaking the public's will via terror bombing is absolutely not a winning strategy considering it has basically never worked.\n\nIs there a limit to how many cruise missiles you are willing to fight off? Or does Putin *hope* there is a limit because there's only so many Russia can produce a month?\n\nI'll take historical precedent over whatever reading of \"Slavic\" culture you are spouting. If it truly is a culture of sadness and melancholy then things that make would make people sad and melancholic like blackouts and the occasional cruise missile strike should just be another Tuesday.\n\nYour logic is completely inconsistent.\n\n>This was less a maneuver assault and more Russia taking advantage of knowing Ukraine could not stop them. There is nothing to show that Russia will not stop this. Ukraine is not mobilizing or training enough men. They do not have enough equipment.\n\nYou speak about Ukrainian equipment shortfalls and whilst the Ukrainians have always been at a disadvantage in this area, does Russia have enough equipment to \"take advantage\" of places where Ukraine cannot stop them? Russia does not have an infinite number of recruits lining up to fight in the war else there would be no need to increase recruitment bonuses to the level they are now. Russia does not have an infinite number of armoured vehicles to allow for forward assaults at the rate they are now.\n\nHow is Russia going to continue sustain this costly tactic of advance once Ukraine's mobilisation bill starts picking up steam and the troops exit training and join the frontlines?\n\n>I do not think its right to act like Russia\u00a0*isnt*\u00a0capable of punching through an exhausted Ukrainian line.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Yes they can. Its just that Ukraine never gave them a good enough reason to try it after the lessons they learned in Kharkiv and Kherson.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why would the country who originally intended to overthrow the Ukrainian government and essentially annex the entire country and has supposedly minimalist war aims of annexing four Ukrainian regions which they are far from being able to do so at the moment need a better reason to engage in manoeuvre warfare?</p>\n\n<p>If the Russians were actually capable of competent manoeuvre warfare, they would have employed it in order to annex the four Ukrainian regions which Putin himself has stated are Russia&#39;s minimalist war aims. They fact the Russians are still bashing their heads into fortifications and advancing at glacial speeds whilst incurring completely unsustainable losses to the point they need to increase recruitment bonuses to absurd levels tells me the Russians are completely incapable of doing anything other than what they&#39;re doing now.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But once the Ukrainians evaporated their lines of the best troops for the Kursk invasion, the reason presented itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Russia is doing in Povrosk is not manoeuvre warfare. They are still advancing at a relatively slow pace. They are still incurring high losses and they are not doing anything even resembling &quot;manoeuvre warfare&quot;. If this is the best Russia can muster up when Ukraine has diverted their best troops, a lot of their ammunition and have yet to fill their ranks with additional recruits and conscripts from the mobilisation bill then I fear Russia has a <em>very</em> long path ahead of it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As to the psychological aspect, it is something I only ever really hear as a viable strategy from Slavic, namely post Soviet Russian/Ukrainians. The culture is steeped in sadness and melancholy. It is a known mentality to &quot;deal with the worst so it doesnt get worser&quot; in these parts of the world. Maybe there have not been enough power outages yet, that does not mean it isnt possible. There is a limit to how many cruise missiles you are willing to try and fight off until you accept demands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians, Polish, Estonians, Latvians and so on endured decades of Soviet oppression and far worse living conditions without much of a fuss. We&#39;ve seen countless times throughout history that when it comes to an existential war, breaking the public&#39;s will via terror bombing is absolutely not a winning strategy considering it has basically never worked.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a limit to how many cruise missiles you are willing to fight off? Or does Putin <em>hope</em> there is a limit because there&#39;s only so many Russia can produce a month?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll take historical precedent over whatever reading of &quot;Slavic&quot; culture you are spouting. If it truly is a culture of sadness and melancholy then things that make would make people sad and melancholic like blackouts and the occasional cruise missile strike should just be another Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Your logic is completely inconsistent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This was less a maneuver assault and more Russia taking advantage of knowing Ukraine could not stop them. There is nothing to show that Russia will not stop this. Ukraine is not mobilizing or training enough men. They do not have enough equipment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You speak about Ukrainian equipment shortfalls and whilst the Ukrainians have always been at a disadvantage in this area, does Russia have enough equipment to &quot;take advantage&quot; of places where Ukraine cannot stop them? Russia does not have an infinite number of recruits lining up to fight in the war else there would be no need to increase recruitment bonuses to the level they are now. Russia does not have an infinite number of armoured vehicles to allow for forward assaults at the rate they are now.</p>\n\n<p>How is Russia going to continue sustain this costly tactic of advance once Ukraine&#39;s mobilisation bill starts picking up steam and the troops exit training and join the frontlines?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do not think its right to act like Russia\u00a0<em>isnt</em>\u00a0capable of punching through an exhausted Ukrainian line. Its chess. Its very in the realm of possibility in this war that somehow Ukraine has a section of front vacated of almost all anti armour capacity</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You ironically just described what Ukraine is doing right now in Kursk.
