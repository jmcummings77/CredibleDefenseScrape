As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "A report from the 3rd Assault Brigade was published today, and I take the opportunity to make a quick update about the situation in Avdiivka.\n\n>Update from Avdiivka: occupants' losses and intelligence data.\n\n>At least 15 thousand enemy troops are fighting against the forces of the Third Separate Assault Brigade in our section of the front in Avdiivka.\n\n>Our brigade inflicted critical damage on the 74th and 114th separate motorized rifle brigades of the Russian army. Both enemy units have been virtually wiped out.\n\n>The actual number of casualties is estimated at 4,200 enemy \"200s\" and \"300s\".\n\n>The 30th Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces is also suffering significant losses. Fighting is ongoing against the 35th and 55th brigades of the 41st Army, and against the 21st and 15th brigades of the 2nd Army.\n\n>According to the available data of the Third Assault Brigade, the enemy's forces in our section of the front are as follows: 35th; 55th and 74th separate motorized rifle brigades from the 41st Combined Arms Army.\nAlso: 15th, 21st and 30th separate motorized rifle brigades of the 2nd Combined Arms Army.\nIn particular, the 114th separate motorized rifle brigade, the former 11th separate motorized rifle regiment of the so-called \"DPR\", is fighting against Ukrainian forces.\n\n>Some tasks are performed by GRU personnel, who carry out night assaults using night vision equipment, conduct sabotage, and adjust air and artillery strikes.\n\n>Despite the fact that the occupiers suffer disproportionate losses, the situation in Avdiivka remains extremely difficult.\n\nhttps://t. me/ab3army/3652\n\nBeyond the declarations about Russian losses that might be exaggerated (this is normal), the statement about the units they are fighting against confirms what was already known about the Russian order of battle in Avdiivka; rather, the brigades they mentioned may give an insight about the current deployment area of the 3rd Assault Brigade.\n\nUkrainian military observer Miroshnikov wrote earlier that Ukrainian units have left the vast majority of Avdiivka and now remain in two spots: the Coke Plant and the 9th District. I believe both strongholds are defended by the 3rd Assault Brigade. He also reported that the situation near the Coke Plant is getting worse. The latter, the forest belts in the direction of Lastochkyne and the area of the Avdiivka railway station are being attacked by the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and the 30th and 21st Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Army of the Central MD. In particular, the 114th Brigade has recently occupied the area of the former \"Brevno\" restaurant and the intersection of O0542 Road with the Industrialny Prospekt. As I understand it, the 3rd Assault Brigade was deployed over the last week with a defensive purpose: holding these positions and allowing the Ukrainian garrison to withdraw from the urban area. They would also have carried out several counterattacks in order to drive the Russians away from the west side of the railway, but only managed to slow them down, without having been able to achieve stable successes.\n\nProbably the entire 110th Mechanized Brigade (which was severely attrited) has been or is being withdrawn along with other minor units that were inside Avdiivka. The 3rd Assault Brigade covers the area of the two strongholds mentioned above, while the 53rd Mech Brigade continues to cover the southern flank. It's not quiet either: today the Ukrainian military observer Kovalenko reported that for the first time the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army of the Central MD was brought into the battle (elements had already been involved before, mainly in November) in the direction of Sjeverne in order to put pressure, from the south, on the Ukrainian withdrawal.\n\nThe fact that the 3rd Assault Brigade mentioned that it had greatly damaged the 74th Motorized Brigade (41st Army) may confirm that the 9th District is garrisoned by the 3rd Brigade and is being heavily attacked, from the south, by the 74th Brigade. \n\nThe 1st Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps recently captured the \"Zenith\" as well as the other fortified area down there, \"Cheburashka\" (the intersection of the T-05-05 Road with the unfinished Donetsk ring road). Today they should be clearing up the area known as \"Vinohradsky-2\", i.e. the area of the dachas along the T-05-05 Road, north of Cheburashka. With the loss of these strongholds, it's possible that the Russians will be able to quickly approach the southern limit of the 9th District, towards which the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army is also involved.\n\nThe 87th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps, the 10th Tank Regiment of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps, the 1487th Regiment of the Territorial Forces and the \"Veterans\" Assault and Recon Brigade are advancing from Soborna Street and the industrial area (Promka) towards the private sector. The Russians likely have \"finally\" captured the holiday cottages in Skotovata and have taken up positions on Lisna Street. The \"Pyatnashka\" Battalion of the 1st Corps yesterday occupied the Donetsk Filtration Station, another Ukrainian stronghold. \n\nThe Russians report that the \"Hispaniola\" Assault and Recon Brigade is active in the \"beach of Avdiivka\" (the western shore of the Sand Quarry) in the direction of the Avdiivka's main cemetery, and there would also be in the area the 115th Special Brigade of the Rosgvardia, which includes former Wagnerites. I'm not aware of the current status of the terrikon south-east of the Sand Quarry; it's possible that it was recently abandoned by the Ukrainians.\n\nThe Ukrainian 47th and 116th Mech Brigades, along with other smaller units, continue to be active in the area north of the Coke Plant and in defending Stepove and Berdychi, towards which the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army is continuing to put pressure. Overall, many elements of SF/SOF units from both sides are also active in Avdiivka.\n\nMoreover, on the Russian side there are elements of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD, which is both being committed and is likely also a kind of Russian reserve / second echelon in the sector. All three of its tank regiments (239th, 80th, 6th) are around Avdiikva. Kovalenko had reported some days ago that several battalions of the 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Division have been withdrawn from the Serebrianka Forest (Kreminna sector), along with the 348th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, attached to it. Apparently for R&R, but I wouldn't rule out that they arrived in Avdiivka with all the rest of the division. In any case, the numerical disadvantage on the Ukrainian side is huge, especially considering the numerous Russian territorial regiments in the sector.\n\nThe last week has been extremely bloody for both sides, in relation to the average level of losses for each of the sides. I wouldn't be surprised if daily casualties were at the level of the days of urban clashes inside Soledar in early January 2023 or on the Bakhmut's flanks in February 2023.",

One of the episodes where they went into depth about how the UAF typically command and control an attack. Both had said in the past that the Ukrainians can't C2 more than 2-3x companies at a time, 2x to attack and 1x in reserve, but never went into detail until this podcast episode. And it was always confusing to me, as companies of 2x up, 1x back is the quintessential battalion attack. But why is a brigade with a minimum of 4x battalions only attacking with 1x at a time? \n\nWatling said because of command and staff issues at the battalion level. On the offense, the battalion HQ is essentially bypassed for mission planning and execution, as he said they hold a morale role (though I'm sure it's larger, at a minimum they'd still do admin and logistics too). Because the battalions can't organize a proper attack, the brigade (who have the larger staffs that are typically more competent) have to do it instead.\n\nMy interpretation of that is that they're effectively double hat'ing, doing the job of the battalion and brigade commanders. But even they can't do that, which means they're playing battalion commander when it comes to maneuver units, but brigade commander when it comes to delegating support assets, so a battalion attack gets the same level of fire support and other that would normally go to a whole brigade attack.\n\nWhat Watling also said said was the battalion command level only takes charge during defensive operations. Why? It's easier to command and control, there is less planning and coordination necessary, fires are likely decentralized already, etc.\n\nIn the case of defending Stepove, the most difficult aspect of launching what amounted to be platoon sized or smaller Bradley IFV counterattacks would be having them close enough to the front line, in a hide site, to start with. At the point the defending infantry outposts (which might not have even been from the 47th) report a Russian attack, or drones pick them up, the mech infantry platoon spins up, moves forward and lights up the Russians with usually long range cannon fires, usually forcing them to retreat because there is little to no cover in that area, supported by drone directed arty and FPV drones, and then falls back before Russian drones could spot and engage them. It's a pretty simple battle drill.\n\nA combined arms breach of a mined obstacle, followed by an assault against a well defended defensive positions under observation most of the time and taking incoming PGM fires, where perfect coordination and synchronization is needed, isn't simple at all, it's extremely complex and that assumes they even have tactical answers to the defensive problems, namely interrupting drone directed recon fires complex (something both sides do very well in this war).",

FBK, his \"organization\" turned government corruption into a source of entertainment and if anything helped normalize it.

Creating a solidified comprehension of the world with too-little input. An us-vs-them mentality. However you want to structure it\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, don't forget to inspect and question your own version of reality. Like, how do you think the average Russian/etc. views the situation & views how your country functions.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, I think if you fail to do that once in awhile, you wind up where a lot of us were feb 2022, saying, \"woe is us. how could this happen? what must be going through their minds?\" etc.\n\nI think a lot of people see a headline line, \"Navalny dies in prison\", and come to CD looking for interpretation of it. What I'm trying to say to those people is, consider (if you haven't already) that it isn't necessarily some outrageous occurrence. If you reacted to the headline emotionally, and failed to consider that corruption occurs in your government as well (regardless of whether you're American, German, Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese...) please take some time to reflect on how you felt about it happening in Russia (who's fault was it? how did they get to a place where political figureheads could be possibly assassinated in prison? who allows that to happen?) and contrast those feelings to your own situation (maybe you're ignorant, maybe you say something like, \"oh it isn't that bad where I live\", or, \"oh it happens everywhere\" etc.). Basically, why haven't you held yourself to the same standards?\n\nI think what I'm trying to shine some light on is the importance of basic values in a well-functioning democracy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom my personal perspective, do I think Navalny died naturally or was killed? I don't know, I assume more information will come out in a few months, similar to Prigozhin's death. I think speculation now is not useful; similar to the cycles of speculation we've been through for 2 years. I say that every time.\n\nDo I think Putin could/would kill Navalny? Absolutely, why not? But the question would also be why? And none of us can answer either; it's CD. Nor can we say with certainty what happened to Epstein.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, @sokratesz, in my opinion, this: \"Literally everyone thinks Epstein's death was suspicious. Nice attempt at Whataboutism troll.\" isn't appropriate for CD, and doesn't promote discussion. Anyone could have asked me to clarify or elaborate on what I wrote. Instead people chose to respond emotionally & build a strawman to hate.\n\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again, because I still believe it: I hope Ukraine takes back every inch of their country, including Crimea, by force if necessary. I hope they lose as little life as possible in that process. I hope they maintain control of their government, and tolerate no corruption from their politicians. I hope they receive the most effective military equipment available (which in my underinformed opinion are drones & advanced mines, but no one seems to care & shouts F16 + M1 instead). I wish the best for the Ukrainian men fighting for their territorial integrity. I think one of the most disrespectful things I/you/anyone could do would be to underestimate the severity or difficulty of what is required to achieve that, and the lifelong consequences hundreds of thousands of people will directly live with. My attempt to respect them, is saying some version of, \"hey, something like this has kind of happened before. shouldn't we take a moment to stop and reflect on XYZ, and try to break the cycle?\". IMO, the people who get upset, and try to create outrage over that, are why the cycle continues.",

Other Air Force officials also provided additional details at other roundtables and panel talks at the event today, all of which The War Zone attended.*\n\n*\"[CCA] increment two is moving forward,\" Kendall said. \"We're going to be awarding increment two efforts [contracts] in the next fiscal year, FY25 [Fiscal Year 2025], to do what we're doing now essentially with the original five contractors,\" which is \"concept definition, preliminary design\" type of work.*\n\n*Kendall further disclosed that increment two, which will be a second tranche of drones, will be the first segment of the CCA program to possibly include participation by foreign allies and partners. When asked to elaborate about which countries could be brought in, the Secretary said only that \"the tendency will be to [invite] our closest partners, our strategic partners\" and that this would be a \"natural\" decision for a program of this type.*\n\n*\"So, for increment two ... we'll be kicking off a process with industry to really start to narrow in on what is increment two going to be, what's it going to be able to do,\" Andrew Hunter, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, elaborated during a separate roundtable at the Warfare Symposium today. \"And because we're on the front end of that, that's why we think there's so much opportunity to to really bring partners and allies into the conversation very early on to make them part of that process as well.\"*\n\n*Hunter noted that international participation in increment two would not necessarily involve everyone working toward acquiring exactly the same air vehicles with the same capabilities, though it could. He drew comparisons to existing active Air Force collaboration with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps on their respective CCA-type programs.*\n\n*\"I talked about the architectures, and architectures can cut across increments. Well you can readily see then that we have our increments that are optimized for United States Air Force,\" Hunter said. \"The United States Navy and Marine Corps are also looking at collaborative combat aircraft systems\" and \"I think of them as their increments,\" but \"using this sort of common architectures that we've developed, and that they can contribute to.\"*\n\n*\"I could see it operating very much the same way with the partners and allies. So their system could be, you could think of it as an increment of CCA that's unique to them potentially, or that they could market to other capable partners around the world,\" he continued. \"But leveraging the architectures that have been produced through our collaborative combat aircraft program.\"*\n\n*Hunter pointed out that just gaining access to these kinds of shared technologies, and the U.S. vendor base that supports them, could be attractive to foreign allies and partners.*\n\n*\"So when we talk about the CCA vendors, we often talk about kind of the five that are working on increment one air vehicle[s]. But there is a another slew of contractors that are also part of the vendor base for CCA ... many of them working specifically on software,\" Hunter explained. \"That is independent of individual increments. That is a core capability. ... it is one of the foundational architectures of the CCA effort.\"*\n\n*\"And it's one of the things that once our crew discusses working with international partners, right, that's a capability that we can make available to them,\" he continued. \"So that's significant part of how we envision collaborating with allies and partners.\"*",

If an AFV is advancing alongside a T-90M (do you even know what that is?)\n\nYes, I do. I also know that it's not the most common vehicle in use in the Russian military. I don't doubt that an IFV accompanied by one is almost certainly Russian. But the T-72, for example, is one of the most commonly used Russian tanks and to my understanding we sent Ukraine more of that model alone than any one of our own designs (mostly Leopard Is and IIs on that front).\n\nDo I know they fudge numbers? No clue. Can I imagine they do, quite likely unintentionally? Sure. Or maybe the Russians inflict casualties moreso through bombs and indirect artillery fire, or maybe they just don't feel as inclined to release videos of them (though I doubt that). But with Ukraine somehow winning every battle yet losing the war I've grown very cynical of lofty claims like a 10:1 casualty ratio.\n\n> It's... a very large war. There are lots of lies about it out there, constantly. That's an even less convincing counterargument.\n\nWhich is why I've decided to not trust day to day reporting on individual battles and instead look at the bigger, more easily verifiable and objective picture. Maybe you can distinguish the fact from fiction, or maybe you just feel confident you can, but on my end all I'm seeing regardless of platform is supposedly very credible claims of Ukrainian success in every single battle that simply do not add up to the very unpleasant picture the conflict overall is painting. As such I think it's more reasonable for me to retain a high level of skepticism of such claims in general.\n\nIf we're to use this platform specifically as an example, I remember doing this exact same song and dance in the comments at Krynky where I was told that very credible sources were backing up the notion that Ukraine was somehow seriously degrading the Russian forces there and achieving massively lopsided casualties and I distinctly remember other people doing it at Bakhmut. I don't have the tools to reliably tell fact from fiction, plain and simple. But I don't see how I can take every single time where I thought Ukraine was doing well, where reputable outlets were reporting that Ukraine was doing well and match them up with the reality that they're not. As such I feel more secure in relying on things that I can confidently establish as fact such as ground gains and losses confirmed by both sides while being highly skeptical of things that sound a bit too good to be true. I'd be very happy if Ukraine actually managed to trade extremely well in Avdiivka, but between the frequent Russian bombardments and credible reports of constant ammunition shortages from the Ukrainian side themselves (which -I assume- wouldn't be lying to make their own situation look worse than it is) I just don't see how I'm not better off being skeptical.",

They also have their previous public debt payments to international holders suspended [until March 2027](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-western-creditors-sign-debt-suspension-agreement-through-march-2027-2023-12-21/). The issue is that no international debt holders will loan more (barring the EU and IMF) until debt payments restart. That means any additional borrowing would have to be from internal (Ukrainian) debt holders, which would be more difficult because of the economy not being that good. Ukraine's projected revenues are only $40bn for 2024. They would need a lot more than that in war bonds (or something similar) to keep them afloat this year as they project a deficit of about $40bn (though that was prior to the EU bill passage). \n\nIn the short term, money to buy supplies is more important than not money for no supplies. In the medium term (3-5 years), it starts to cause issues as debt payments come due whether Ukraine is still at war with Russia or not. Ukraine's debt to GDP ratio as calculated [by IMF is 98%](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/UKR) with a GDP of $186bn and running about a 19% deficit every year. The $62bn Ukraine aid as loans would essentially add another 33% of GDP to their debt. Now, not all of that goes directly to Ukraine, but I'm just hand waving that instead of the humanitarian aid used in the US/Europe would go to something like economic assistance. Also, that $62bn is more likely to be enough to maintain the status quo, but not provide a massive influx of equipment and ammunition. It would need to be double that. Looking at those numbers, it becomes apparent that loans would quickly consume over 200% of Ukraine's GDP in a year or two.\n\nNow, if as you said, they don't have to pay back the loans (or they're very generous terms like 25 years at 1%), it's much less of an issue. I couldn't find the rates for those loans, but did find a [think tank blog post](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/foreign-military-financing-program-loans-good-bad-and-potentially-very-ugly) that noted Foreign Military Financing loans had been forgiven in the past. However, purchase of military equipment is only a portion of Ukraine's expenditures, with a large amount being non-military equipment purchases as well. \n\nHigh Debt to GDP after the war will also hinder international private investment for rebuilding, a key complementary part to public international investment, because of increased risk of default. This is why one of the proposed methods for using frozen Russian assets is not to directly pay Ukraine, but offer them as a loan guarantee if Russia does not pay reparations. That way it frees up international investment now as it decreases the risk. However, any use of those funds has yet to move forward. \n\nThat's why grants are favored over loans. Also, Ukraine can always get more loans later if need be. Getting grants pushes that timeframe out, however, helping mitigate some of these issues.",

But at the same time, the Ukrainians were weakening too. However, the Russian strategic situation is MUCH better than the Ukrainians; while the Russians can't sustain this pace indefinitely and these losses are very likely going to bite them in the ass someday, the Ukrainians are currently suffering from a major manpower crisis, right now they can't sustain these losses. \n\nThe way that translated into reality was one of the key brigades defending the East eastern and southern side of the salient, who had been in the line nonstop at Avdiivka still March 2022, were effectively destroyed. But the cracks weren't sudden, the plight of the 110th was known for quite some time, as the troops themselves didn't try to hide it, they were routinely trying to warn their chain of command that they needed to be relieved. \n\nBut the UA political strategic leadership thought otherwise. Whether they didn't want to commit reserves for Avdiivka, or there were no ready reserves to relieve the 110th, they dawdled. And in that time a  breakthrough happened, the 110th took more losses, the local tactical reserves were committed, failed to retake lost ground, and then shortly afterwards another breakthrough happened, and at that point the whole situation collapsed.\n\nThere is lots of talk that there are no fixed defenses anywhere near the immediate rear of Avdiivka. That's indicative of the problem, and it's the result of poor allocation of forces and manpower. The UAF needs reserve units moved there who WON'T be used in the front lines, who will only dig in and then man the defenses. But they wouldn't allocate them, they wouldn't even allocate the reserves to reinforce the actual front lines.

Considering that the 110th Mech Brigade for its entire existence was in Avdiivka, the need of having tanks in first place was way lower than in other brigades. It seems that APCs were also lately given to other brigades: near Bohdanivka the Russian 200th Motorized Brigade of the Arctic Fleet captured a YPR-765 on which was written \"110 OMBr\". Considering that we are sure that the 110th Mech Brigade is not fighting up there, it seems quite clear that the brigade has transferred some of its armored vehicles to other brigades and could be basically a rifle brigade. Which makes sense, since it used to defend fixed positions in an urban context.\n\nMoreover, Tatarigami had written that the CAAs of the Central MD committed in Avdiivka received armored vehicles from the new 25th Army to make up for equipment losses. This was confirmed by visual evidence. Also, an update to what I wrote yesterday: according to evidence recently published by Russian sources, the assault detachments of the 41st Army have been involved in the attacks in the western side of the Sand Quarry since the last days of January; in the last few days elements of the 74th Motorized Brigade have been fighting in the area of the railway station (where there have been extremely bloody clashes with the 3rd Assault Brigade) and elements of the 55th Mountain Brigade have been spotted in the area of the station's hospital and of the city park. Hence elements of the brigades of the 41st Army along with elements of the 90th Tank Division (I imagine mostly their Storm battalions) have been involved in urban fighting from the north-east, besides from putting pressure on the southern flank. This could also mean that the 2nd Army, active in the same direction (from the north-east), is now considerably damaged.\n\nI agree that the ratio of equipment losses (with Russian losses over 10 times higher than Ukraine's) do not match at all the human losses. Russia lost so much armored vehicles because it carried out so many armored/mechanized attacks on the flanks and in general they can afford to lose more equipment. At the same time, this does not mean the human losses between the two sides are even. Zelensky today stated a ratio of 1:7. Yeah, this is likely very exaggerated and therefore an upper limit of the potential ratio. But I would still expect Russian human losses in Avdiivka since October 10 to be a multiple (though not close to Zelensky's level) of Ukrainian casualties, with the ratio worsening during 2024.",
