        "body": "Time for a new update about the tactical situation of the front in Ukraine and on the events of the last month. Today I will comment on the sectors from Kupyansk to Horlivka, and tomorrow on those from Avdiivka to the Dnipro River. As usual, my main sources are the Ukrainian military observators Mashovets and Kovalenko, several Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels (e.g. WarArchive for geolocations) and of course DeepState, in addition to social medias for MIA notices for both sides, which are very useful especially for locating units. I suggest having a map under eye while reading, for instance DeepState or Andrew Perpetua's. \n\nKupyansk sector. According to Mashovets, the bulk of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA (= Tank Army) of the Moscow Military District is being transferred here from the Kreminna sector, where it had been moved a couple of months ago, with the aim of replacing the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet and supporting the offensive actions of the 6th CAA (= Combined Arms Army) of the Leningrad MD. Elements of the 272nd Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division arrived in Tavilzhanka, with the task to be committed in action in the area near Lyman Pershyi, along with the 138th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA. Over the past week the 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA resumed attacks against Synkivka, which have been going on for months and months, but again without any success. Indeed, over the past month the Ukrainians have likely recaptured the northern end of the village. \n \nOn the Ukrainian side, the 32nd Mechanized Brigade was transferred to Synkivka from the area near Ivanivka, probably in order to replace the 115th Mech Brigade, which recently went to Avdiivka.\n \nThe 26th Tank Regiment of the 47th Tank Division and the 347th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to this division) were deployed between Pershotravneve and Yahidne. In the rear, the 744th Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment of the 47th Tank Division also arrived from Kreminna. At the moment it appears that, among the other units of this formation, the 153rd Tank Regiment may still be in Kreminna, while the 245th Motorized Regiment, currently along the state border in Belgorod, might arrive in the future. \n \nAs for the actions in Belgorod last month, those with the highest intensity were the work of the Russian Volunteer Corps and of the Siberian Battalion, from Velyka Pysarivka in the direction of Grayvoron. Today the raids have come to an halt and the (weak) intensity of the fighting along the border returned to the usual pace. As I wrote above, it\u2019s reported that additional elements of the 18th Motorized Division are being transferred along the state border in Belgorod Oblast, whereas in recent months this division has provided support to the 6th CAA in the Kupyansk sector. \n \nThe offensive actions of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st GTA in the area around Tabaivka were completely contained by the 103rd TDF Brigade together with the 17th Battalion of the 57th Motorized Brigade and elements of the 3rd Tank Brigade, which have replaced the 67th Mech Brigade (which halted the Russian breakthrough during February), which was transferred to Bakhmut. \n \nSvatove sector. The 423rd Motorized Regiment of the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA recently carried out attacks from Dzherelne towards Andriivka, against the positions of the 44th Mech Brigade, without success. A little further north, in the Novoselivske area, the 77th Airmobile Brigade recently arrived and replaced the 25th Airborne Brigade, which was moved to Avdiivka. The bulk of the 68th Jager Brigade was transferred to Avdiivka too, and it\u2019s unclear by whom they were replaced - potentially by elements of the TDF. In any case, the section of the front it covered (Nadiia/Novojehorivka), affected by the Russian offensive of the summer, is now very quiet, and on the Russian side there are minor units such as the 380th Regiment of the Territorial Forces. \n \nKreminna sector. The Russian offensive in the direction of Terny and Yampolivka continues, representing by far the largest Russian effort north of Bakkhmut. The entire 144th Motorized Division (20th CAA, MMD) is attacking in the direction of Terny, supported by the 252nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division (20th CAA), transferred here last month from the Svatove sector, and the assault detachments of the 752nd Motorized Regiment of the same division. Around a month ago, the Russians had managed to advance more than 1 km along the forested ravine (which the Russians call \u201cPike\u201d), i.e. the first of the series of ravines to the east of Terny. \n \nIn the directions of Yampolivka, elements of the 67th Motorized Division (25th CAA, CMD) are attacking, supported by several detached battalions of all the three divisions (2nd, 4th, 47th) of the 1st GTA. As I wrote last week, there is some evidence that servicemen of the 67th Motorized Division were sent to Avdiivka, possibly some assault detachments or to replenish the units deployed in Avdiivka - but there is no evidence yet to state that units from this division were transferred to Avdiivka. Russian sources indicate that in the last week the 20th CAA has taken over some positions from the 25th CAA along the ravine known to the Russians as \"Alligator\", the one south of the \"Pike\u201d.\n \nIn the past month, the Russians have made no progress towards Terny, other than a positional one, despite Russian rumors from time to time that they are entering Terny - which are denied by Russian channels that have contact with their soldiers in the field. The Russians never managed to take positions in the forested ravine known as \"Mitten\", south of \"Alligator\". The intensity of the fighting is very high, as are the human and material losses. The Ukrainians are offering valiant and stubborn resistance, despite the fact that they are fighting in topographically disadvantageous conditions (it\u2019s the Russians who have the elevation advantage here, as they\u2019re coming down from the watershed). The large Ukrainian grouping in this sector over the past month has been joined by the 2nd Mech Battalion of the 93rd Mech Brigade, the bulk of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, and elements of the \"Azov\" and \"Bureviy\" Brigades of the National Guard, which arrived from the Serebrianka Forest. The reason the Ukrainians are tenaciously defending this area is that losing it would probably mean losing the other positions east of the Zherebets and the Serebrianka Forest.\n \nIn the latter place, the intensity of clashes has decreased compared to 2023 and also to the past months, as both the Ukrainians and the Russians have removed numerous units from the forest in favor of other areas. The Russian units currently deployed in the forest are likely the 169th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA, the elements of the 201st Military Base that are deployed in Ukraine and several \"Akhmat\" units, such as the 204th Regiment of the \u201cAkhmat Special Forces\u201d, which have been moved to the forest over the recent months to partly make up for the relocation of other units elsewhere. Currently, \"Akhmat\" detachments are fighting in the Serebrianka Forest, Bilohorivka and Klishchiivka. \n \nSiversk sector. The 7th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps (8th CAA, Southern MD) recently had some successes in Bilohorivka, which is defended by the 81st Airmobile Brigade (along with a battalion of the 119th TDF Brigade). The Russians captured several Ukrainian trenches to the west and south of the chalk processing plant, and in recent days they have been geolocated climbing along the chalk quarry, the eastern part of which hosts a number of Ukrainian observation/ATGM points. Last week, the Russians also captured a tree line south of the chalk quarry, which is beginning to be surrounded on three sides. \n \nFrom what I have read from Ukrainian sources, Russian drone activity in this area is very high (including FPV drones) and as a consequence the rotations are difficult, with many movements being spotted. \n \nFurther south, the 6th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps attacked the Ukrainian positions along the heights east of Verkhnokamyanske, which are covered by elements of the 54th Mech Brigade and of the 118th TDF Brigade, reaching the trenches system halfway between Zolotarivka and Verkhnokamyanske. \n \nStill further south, during the current month there were Russian successes in the direction of Vyimka, which is the area covered by the Ukrainian 10th Mountain Assault Brigade. The 123rd Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps advanced more than 1 km along the Siversk-Nyrkove railway and east of it, approaching an Ukrainian trenches system; while, west of the railway, the 51st Airborne Regiment advanced about 1 km, capturing an Ukrainian trench located 2 kms north of Vesele, a village that is currently under Russian control up to the Sukha Plotva River. \n \nThe 137th Airborne Regiment of the 106th VDV Division is trying to advance towards Rozdolivka, but in this case with little success. In any case, it is clear that the liquidation of the Siversk salient is one of the Russian priorities in the long-term plan to approach the Sloviansk/Kramatorsk conurbation (and also Lyman).",

            "body": "Bakhmut sector. The 98th VDV Division continues its offensive in the direction of Chasiv Yar, advancing 2 kms in the last three weeks. A week ago its 331st Airborne Regiment succeeded in reaching the Kanal District (the neighborhood of Chasiv Yar located to the east of the Donets-Donbas Canal), with support from the 215th Separate Recon Battalion of the 98th VDV Division. Russian paratroopers reportedly took control of several buildings at the eastern end of the district. Chasiv Yar is defended by the 67th Mech Brigade, entirely transferred here during the second half of March.\n \nThe Russians also crossed the Bakhmut - Chasiv Yar railway, reaching the southern part of Bohdanivka and forcing the Ukrainians to abandon their positions in the center of the village in order to avoid a risk of encirclement, allowing the 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet, supported by the \"St. George\" Assault and Recon Brigade of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps, to seize the entire settlement. The Ukrainians (elements of the 56th Motorized Brigade and of the 142nd Infantry Brigade, plus one battalion each from the 24th and 93rd Mech Brigades) retreated to the trenches in the area of the farm, halfway between Bohdanivka and Kalinina. On the northern flank of Bakhmut the bulk of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps is concentrated, which encompasses numerous former Russian volunteer units or PMCs. Last month the \"Veterans\" Assault and Recon Brigade had been moved here from Avdiivka \u2013 now, per official brigade\u2019s sources, has been moved to the rear for R&R, being replaced by the \"Hispaniola\" Assault and Recon Brigade, which is back in action.\n \nThe 217th and 299th Airborne Regiments of the 98th VDV Division are advancing south of the Kanal District, in the nature reserve \u201cStupky-Golubovski 2\u201d, managing to occupy part of the forested area east of the canal. As I had written a few days ago, I believe the Russians' priority at the moment is to occupy the Kanal District and reach the canal over an area as large as possible. The 98th VDV Division has been conducting offensive actions since the beginning of November, and as much as it has proven to be a capable formation and among the most successful of the RuAF, I have my doubts that it will be able to continue offensive actions against the western bank of the canal in the future, and I believe that as much as the Russian grouping around Bakhmut is very large, there will be a need for reinforcements to directly target Chasiv Yar. \n \nThe 11th VDV Brigade is attacking from the northern part of Ivanivske with the goal of advancing along Road T0504 in the direction of Stupochky. In recent weeks the Ukrainians had been able to stem the Russian advance and stabilize the situation in Ivanivske, but with the Russian advance over the last week the situation in the village for the Ukrainians has become considerably complicated and it is possible that soon the area of the settlement may be abandoned altogether, with the Ukrainians withdrawing along the canal. The 102nd Motorized Regiment and elements of the 68th Tank Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division (8th CAA, SMD) are attacking the remaining Ukrainian positions in Ivanivske from the east. \n \nThe Ukrainian units that have defended and are defending the area east of the Kanal District and around Ivanivske in recent weeks are numerous: the 42nd Mech Brigade (with the the 214th Special Battalion OPFOR and the 114th TDF Brigade attached to it), elements of the 5th and 92nd Assault Brigades, a battalion of the 115th TDF Brigade and elements of the 241st TDF Brigade, the 17th Tank Brigade, elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade; recently elements of the 28th Mech Brigade arrived from Kurdyumivka, to which elements of the 112th TDF Brigade were attached. The 1st Mech Battalion of Separate Presidential Brigade has also arrived, joining the other three battalions of this brigade present in the area; along with the 225th Separate Assault Battalion, in this case from Avdiivka. In case of Russian success, it\u2019s likely that these units will withdraw to the Ukrainian trenches along the western bank of the canal. \n \nIn the heights north-west of Klishchiivka, the 4th and 85th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Corps are trying both to occupy Hill 215, along with the part of the extensive trenches system in Ukrainian hands, and to move up, further west, in the direction of Hill 227 - in both cases unsuccessfully.\n \nKlishchiivka is also being attacked from the side of the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway by the 88th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps, the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps (formed by the 1008th, 1194th and 1307th Regiment of the Territorial Forces), along with other regiments of the Territorial Forces Regiments such as the 1428th and the 1442nd, with support of the 83rd VDV Brigade and the 346th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade. No success is recorded for the Russians, thanks to the work of the bulk of the 93rd Mech Brigade, the 5th Assault Brigade, the 22nd Mech Brigade and elements of the 5th \u201cSlobozhansk\u201d Brigade of the National Guard. \n \nThe Russians, even the most optimistic channels, report a difficult situation around Klishchiivka, with Ukrainian FPV drones and artillery being very active. After all, the facts speak for themselves: virtually no significant Russian progress in recent months in the face of constant assaults, extremely costly in human terms. Should the Ukrainians lose the area around Ivanivske, however, it will not be easy for the Ukrainians to keep, and especially resupply, the area around Klishchiivka.\n \nRussian attacks towards Andriivka by the 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps and the 7th Military Base (49th CAA, SMD) also ended without success, thanks to the work of the 92nd Assault Brigade. \n \nHorlivka sector. Nothing to write.\n \nSee you tomorrow for the second part!",

The 98th VDV Division has been conducting offensive actions since the beginning of November, and as much as it has proven to be a capable formation and among the most successful of the RuAF, I have my doubts that it will be able to continue offensive actions against the western bank of the canal in the future, and I believe that as much as the Russian grouping around Bakhmut is very large, there will be a need for reinforcements to directly target Chasiv Yar. </p>\n\n<p>The 11th VDV Brigade is attacking from the northern part of Ivanivske with the goal of advancing along Road T0504 in the direction of Stupochky. In recent weeks the Ukrainians had been able to stem the Russian advance and stabilize the situation in Ivanivske, but with the Russian advance over the last week the situation in the village for the Ukrainians has become considerably complicated and it is possible that soon the area of the settlement may be abandoned altogether, with the Ukrainians withdrawing along the canal. The 102nd Motorized Regiment and elements of the 68th Tank Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division (8th CAA, SMD) are attacking the remaining Ukrainian positions in Ivanivske from the east. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian units that have defended and are defending the area east of the Kanal District and around Ivanivske in recent weeks are numerous: the 42nd Mech Brigade (with the the 214th Special Battalion OPFOR and the 114th TDF Brigade attached to it), elements of the 5th and 92nd Assault Brigades, a battalion of the 115th TDF Brigade and elements of the 241st TDF Brigade, the 17th Tank Brigade, elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade; recently elements of the 28th Mech Brigade arrived from Kurdyumivka, to which elements of the 112th TDF Brigade were attached. The 1st Mech Battalion of Separate Presidential Brigade has also arrived, joining the other three battalions of this brigade present in the area; along with the 225th Separate Assault Battalion, in this case from Avdiivka. In case of Russian success, it\u2019s likely that these units will withdraw to the Ukrainian trenches along the western bank of the canal. </p>\n\n<p>In the heights north-west of Klishchiivka, the 4th and 85th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd Corps are trying both to occupy Hill 215, along with the part of the extensive trenches system in Ukrainian hands, and to move up, further west, in the direction of Hill 227 - in both cases unsuccessfully.</p>\n\n<p>Klishchiivka is also being attacked from the side of the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway by the 88th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps, the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps (formed by the 1008th, 1194th and 1307th Regiment of the Territorial Forces), along with other regiments of the Territorial Forces Regiments such as the 1428th and the 1442nd, with support of the 83rd VDV Brigade and the 346th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade. No success is recorded for the Russians, thanks to the work of the bulk of the 93rd Mech Brigade, the 5th Assault Brigade, the 22nd Mech Brigade and elements of the 5th \u201cSlobozhansk\u201d Brigade of the National Guard. </p>\n\n<p>The Russians, even the most optimistic channels, report a difficult situation around Klishchiivka, with Ukrainian FPV drones and artillery being very active. After all, the facts speak for themselves: virtually no significant Russian progress in recent months in the face of constant assaults, extremely costly in human terms. Should the Ukrainians lose the area around Ivanivske, however, it will not be easy for the Ukrainians to keep, and especially resupply, the area around Klishchiivka.</p>\n\n<p>Russian attacks towards Andriivka by the 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps and the 7th Military Base (49th CAA, SMD) also ended without success, thanks to the work of the 92nd Assault Brigade. </p>\n\n<p>Horlivka sector. Nothing to write.</p>\n\n<p>See you tomorrow for the second part!</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "This week the Telegram channel of the 88th Mechanized Brigade is back active, writing that they are ready to perform combat duties in their assigned area, and claiming to have received Bradleys. I think this is the most mysterious brigade in the UAF - so many rumors about its deployment for a year now. It's not clear where it's being deployed, I am investigating. If I remember correctly it was formed on the basis of elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade.\n\nA month ago the Facebook page of the 13th Jager Brigade woke up from a months-long hibernation writing that soldiers from this brigade are covering the border with Belarus. It's unclear why these two brigades were never deployed to the front unlike the others formed in early 2023, but at least we have confirmation that they exist, which it's good enough.\n\nIn addition to them we have the five new mechanized brigades being created, which it seems will be in part reformed as infantry brigades due to the shortage of spare equipment, and the 5th Tank Brigade (its rifle battalion is in action in the Orikhiv sector), which is probably waiting for the delivery of the Leopard 1A5s. It was said to have received Slovenian M-55s to equip a tank battalion, but last month some of these tanks were seen in service with the 127th TDF Brigade (which might be reformed as a brigade of the Ground Forces in the future). Ukrainian sources complain that the new brigades have the men but it's equipment that is in short supply. \n\nThe 62nd Mechanized Brigade is a very mysterious unit, apparently no longer existing for some reason. The Consolidated Rifle Brigade of the Air Force is mysterious too - in theory it's formed and its social media are active, but I don't think it's deployed anywhere. I don't know if it was a rear unit that Syrsky might take to the front. \n\nAll the other brigades have a known sector of deployment, with elements of the TDF and several protection units of the National Guard covering the state border with Belarus and Russia together with the Border Guards (well, someone has to). \n\nThe 110th Mechanized Brigade is in the strategic rear in the process of restoration, which is likely to last several more weeks at least. Official channels of the brigade stated that new equipment will be received. A group of veterans of the Avdiivka campaign last month went on vacation in the Carpathians with their families - the veterans of this brigade certainly deserve as much rest as possible after what they have been through. The 116th Mechanized Brigade, according to the infos I have gathered, was moved back in the Orikhiv sector (from Avdiivka), yet it's not on the front line, but is digging fortifications in the rear.\n\nBut the way Ukraine usually sends reinforcements where it's needed is by transferring brigades to the hot sectors from quieter ones. Case in point being the 68th Jager Brigade, whose sector has been (relatively) quiet for all of the last 6 months, so we are talking about non-attrited brigades with good cohesion that can easily be moved to where they are needed. Let's note, however, the growing tendency towards fragmentation: battalions from the same brigade in different sectors + one battalion each from many brigades in the same area, which may mean that in such battalions there are too few infantrymen and therefore more battalions from different brigades are needed to have effective combat capabilities, and in the first case that battalions with full combat capabilities of a given brigade are forced to be detached and moved around to support combat actions in different sectors.",

The Taiwan Relations Act, which replaced it, doesn't contain defense guarantees.\n\nAnyway, it is a fallacy to think of geopolitics as it was a game of Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron. Alliances are not \"game events\" that automatically trigger when one country attacks another. There's no practical mechanism that can force a country to honor its alliance commitments. Moreover, the language in treaties is often vague; for instance, in the event of an attack, NATO's Article 5 only requires allies to take \"such action as \\[the member state] deems necessary.\"\n\nWhat alliances are really about is credibility. Look at Armenia and Russia. Russia is formally allied with Armenia, but Azerbaijan doesn't seem to be too worried about that. It isn't just Artsakh, Azerbaijan also occupies small parts of internationally-recognized Armenian territory.\n\nHow come Russia hasn't stopped Azerbaijan? Because the alliance is not credible, Russia has no intention of defending Armenia.\n\nBack to Ukraine. Western leaders have made many public statements showing their commitment to the defense of Ukraine. For example Biden:\n\n- [\"Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken.  We will stand for liberty and freedom today, tomorrow, and for as long as it takes.\"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/07/12/remarks-by-president-biden-on-supporting-ukraine-defending-democratic-values-and-taking-action-to-address-global-challenges-vilnius-lithuania/)\n\n- [\"I will not walk away from Ukraine, and neither will the American people\"](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3615637/biden-pledges-us-will-not-walk-away-from-ukraine/)\n\nThe Western leaders, according to their words, certainly want Ukraine to win and promised to help \"as long as it takes.\" And yet they have failed to deliver. This calls their credibility into question. And it gets worse when we look at *why* this happened.\n\nOne concern often expressed by Western politicians is the fear of escalation. Sending certain weapons to Ukraine, or allowing them to be used on Russian territory, was/is perceived as an unacceptable risk. Let me remind that we are having this discussion in the context of the US entering an actual shooting war with China, a country that appears to be more powerful than Russia. Now *that* would be an escalation.\n\nAnother concern was the cost of aid. \"We can't sacrifice our economy.\" As I said in my earlier comment, just sanctioning China, let alone going to war with them, would pose a much higher cost. Will that suddenly become acceptable?\n\nThen there's the GOP and some rogue European countries blocking the aid for political reasons. They have shown that they are willing to sacrifice foreign policy in order to score points at home. Why can't the same happen in other scenarios? And it's not like there aren't historical precedents for it, the US has had periods of political isolationism.",

Sending certain weapons to Ukraine, or allowing them to be used on Russian territory, was/is perceived as an unacceptable risk. Let me remind that we are having this discussion in the context of the US entering an actual shooting war with China, a country that appears to be more powerful than Russia. Now <em>that</em> would be an escalation.</p>\n\n<p>Another concern was the cost of aid. &quot;We can&#39;t sacrifice our economy.&quot; As I said in my earlier comment, just sanctioning China, let alone going to war with them, would pose a much higher cost. Will that suddenly become acceptable?</p>\n\n<p>Then there&#39;s the GOP and some rogue European countries blocking the aid for political reasons. They have shown that they are willing to sacrifice foreign policy in order to score points at home. Why can&#39;t the same happen in other scenarios? And it&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t historical precedents for it, the US has had periods of political isolationism.</p>\n</div>",

Who just did an hour and a half long podcast all about FPV drones on The Russian Contingency where he said on and on that FPV are a substitute for better weapons, specifically artillery, and that's straight from the mouths of the UAF drone operators.

The system is expensive because it's peace time and you are not acquiring that many so economies of scale doesn't kick in. DJI drones are cheap because they serve a civilian customer base. You can't acquire that many because it's peace time and the equipments are expensive. Also, you are likely to have a lot of outdated stuffs when a war actually breaks out (it may still worth something: see the flood of T-55s, T-62s, T-72s, BMP-1s and 2s, and MT-LB).

For this to work, the USMC needs a lot, like 50, of the simplest landing crafts that carry, perhaps 50 people, and they need it fast.

In order to completely remove key [provisions], in particular, demobilization,\u201d wrote Honcharenko.*\n\n*The military members, who have been serving since 2022, were waiting for this provision, wrote DPSU officer Maksym Nesmyanov.*\n\n*\u201cThis is a disaster...

Two [very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GsyYgTNAYM) [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWi32efwWI4) videos with a combined views of under 200. There's a more recent [FPRI one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RTaaGp0ug8) at \\~800 but it had nearly everything he said in the earlier church video.\n\nAnyway, one of Biddle's point is that while defensive line that is dug-in, with good cover and concealment, deeply-layered, fronted with mines, and backed with reserves are very difficult to break through cleanly and initiate the exploitation phase, said defensive lines still require supplies and ammunition and quite a lot of them. So it's feasible that if the ammunition stock and supplies for Ukraine is low enough, the Russians may be able to breakthrough. That will end the stalemate. Alternatively, a negotiated settlement will end the stalemate because the war is ended.\n\nHowever, the most likely end is still a negotiated settlement because even if either side achieve the maximalist goal: for Ukraine, it's the 1991 border and for Russia, it's the capitulation of the Kiyv government. Even if Ukraine reaches the old 1991 border, Putin doesn't have to end the war. He could just continue bombarding Ukrainian infrastructures, which while may not kill a lot of Ukrainians (today's missile strikes have pathetic bomb loads compared to WWII strategic bombings), can make investment into Ukraine very difficult and unlikely. Ukraine will get poorer and people will just leave; plenty of countries don't have missiles hitting them daily and people still leave. Even if Russia can topple the Kiyv government and destroy the Ukrainian Army, as the USA experienced in Iraq and Afghanistan, an insurgency will start and that doesn't end the war either.\n\nThe most likely end is both sides bleeding one another out until a negotiated settlement is preferrable for both.",

China already boasts the world\u2019s largest navy and could soon surpass the U.S. with the largest air force, Pentagon officials have projected.\n\nI mean, we said the same thing about Japan during the Cold War, but it kind of conveniently ignores the fact that \"in recent years\" China's economy has more or less grown by 7% every year. So even if the amount allocated to the military remains the same, that budget will naturally grow by that percentage.\n\nOverall, the balance of forces between the US and China still favors the US for the sole reason that we have such a massive head-start on China. The issues being brought up here by the various service branch heads have more to do with the fact that our forces don't enjoy the same lopsided advantages as we used to.\n\nThere's also budgetary fights between the branches for a whole host of new weapon systems. For example, there are currently three different contenders for the overall hypersonic budget, with each branch asking for a piece of the pie. \n\n> The U.S. needs a trillion dollar defense budget now.

But this is also a very outdated mode of thinking. Modern day America isn't 1945 America where industrial workers formed the backbone of the economy.

China already boasts the world\u2019s largest navy and could soon surpass the U.S. with the largest air force, Pentagon officials have projected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean, we said the same thing about Japan during the Cold War, but it kind of conveniently ignores the fact that &quot;in recent years&quot; China&#39;s economy has more or less grown by 7% every year. So even if the amount allocated to the military remains the same, that budget will naturally grow by that percentage.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the balance of forces between the US and China still favors the US for the sole reason that we have such a massive head-start on China. The issues being brought up here by the various service branch heads have more to do with the fact that our forces don&#39;t enjoy the same lopsided advantages as we used to.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also budgetary fights between the branches for a whole host of new weapon systems. For example, there are currently three different contenders for the overall hypersonic budget, with each branch asking for a piece of the pie. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. needs a trillion dollar defense budget now. Build a new shipyard on the West Coast ASAP. Write a blank check. Spend whatever is required. Grow the carrier fleet from 11 to 14, and build the docks and support infrastructure necessary to support them. Start cranking out 4 DDG and 3 SSN a year. Speed up DDG-X and Constellation. We should have at least three DDG-X hulls launched, in the water, commissioned, fitted out, crewed, certified and ready to deploy before 2029. If you need workers, draft high school graduates (yes, draft) and teach them the trade. If you need materials like steel and copper, use the Defense Production Act to prioritize military orders over civilian needs. Open more mines if you need to. If you need sailors, draft more high school graduates. Oh, and give every enlisted, warrant officer and commissioned officer a blanket 15% raise with immediate effect, and increase the appropriations topline to afford it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can have all the big ticket items you want, but if you&#39;re struggling to crew them, then what&#39;s even the point? But this is also a very outdated mode of thinking. Modern day America isn&#39;t 1945 America where industrial workers formed the backbone of the economy.

This is an issue in that Russian nuclear doctrine does not consider nuclear weapons in the tactical sense, but the *theater* sense. In that, if youre going to use them you use them against not just combat groupings but the ligaments which enable combat operations. That is, supply depots, HQs, and the like. Which are often colocated with civilian infrastructure, you start to see the problem.\n\nAnd then there is the environmental impact which is not zero. There is almost no true wilderness left in Europe, so places that are not urban areas are still vital to European ecology. Most open space isn't wilderness but crop production, for example. Dropping nukes on farmland will poison them for decades. Most major water bodies provide drinking water to millions (say the Dnepr). You quickly see how this problem expands in severity as you move from one bomb into dozens. The longterm loss of lives through food/water insecurity, destruction of civilian infrastructure, increased cancer and birth defects, etc. will be large. Millions, even in the rural regions of Ukraine, might also be in some way impacted by this even if they dont die. \n\nAll this is to say, in a place as densely populated as Europe there is basically no 'free' land an no tactical-only targets. Pay attention to how the fighting has gone in this war. Its fights from town to town, farmland to farmland. Bakhmut had a prewar population of over 200k. Adiviika was, IIRC, just over 100k. Thats not insignificant, and the use of a tactical weapon even on only combat formations would as collateral inflict massive damage on large population centers.",
