Kharkiv is a no, as that line was so poorly defended by the Russians it didn't take much to punch through it, not proof they can do it when the Russians are actually defending properly.\n\nWhen military theorists are talking about breakthroughs they're typically meaning getting through all tactical level defenses, so no more planned, prepared and manned defensive positions in the rear, allowing for a maneuver centric exploitation. To achieve that now, it's going to be done against a prepared defense in depth, probably with little to no surprise.\n\n>Nevertheless, I'm not even sure where this idea of a \" Russian Grand Offensive\" came from, 2 months ago were discussing the Ukrainian \"Winter Offensive\"...\n\nThe UA govt and many on social media haven't ever shut up about threats of Russian offensives. All through fall and winter they were talking up pending invasion from Belarus. Then Russians manage to reconstitute with the 150,000 Mobiks already sent to Ukraine and supposedly the other 150,000 going too, and Gerasimov is placed in charge of Ukraine (something not done to shore up defenses).

Probably Boeing was working with the Improved Fire Control System, since the GLSDB tests were in 2015, while the Ukrainians may have received upgraded M270A2s and HIMARS which have CFCS, which was only released in 2019 after the GLSDB project was more or less shelved.

The primary sized unit they raise is the brigade, though they have  about a dozen smaller units (battalions/regiments) acting as starter seeds for brigades, which grow like pearls until there is enough unit cohesion to form a brigade around them. They only 'grow' these brigades as they can outfit them as mechanized brigades, with full tank/ artillery battalions, as well as all the support companies organic to a brigade. In the early days of the war the army authorized several green brigades (because they had the vehicles/weapons to do so) before they had experienced smaller units- These units received longer training periods and were generally disappointing until they got enough combat experience, and in the current expansion cycle, this practice seems to have been de-emphasized. They also haven't repeated the process used in 2016-7 to raise the 4 motorized brigades, as they are seriously over matched without a normal brigade compliment of Tanks, artillery and IFVs.

The army has always used these brigades locally, but we are starting to see more TDBs away from their home locations as other militia and voluntary units assume the home guard function.  Either way, the units are full.\n\n- The regular army replacement pool is organized nationally, and replacements are provided to regular army units as needed, and slotted into existing unit structure.  The replacement pool is primarily filled by the best volunteers, sent to the UK or other countries for training and deployed with their full kit provided (removing the supply burden from the receiving units). There is anecdotal evidence that excess western trained recruits are available to fill out newly formed brigades. \n\n- The Interior ministry has access to anyone else, moving the best into their new formed units and the excess into local militias and volunteer units (militia).

        "body": "[New York Times: Pentagon Says It Detected a Chinese Spy Balloon Hovering Over Montana](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/02/us/politics/china-spy-balloon-pentagon.html)\n\n>\tThe revelation comes days before Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s visit to Beijing, where he is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping.\n\n>\tWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States has detected what it says is a Chinese surveillance balloon that has been hovering over the northwestern United States, the Pentagon said on Thursday, a discovery that comes days before Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken\u2019s visit to Beijing.\n\n>\tPresident Biden has chosen, for now, not to shoot down the balloon after a recommendation from Pentagon officials that doing so would risk debris hitting people on the ground, according to a senior defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n>\tThe decision to publicize the discovery appears to put China on notice ahead of Mr. Blinken\u2019s Beijing visit \u2014 the first by an American secretary of state in six years \u2014 during which he is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping. The sudden appearance of the balloon is bound to raise already escalating tensions between the two powers.\n\n>\tThe official said that while it was not the first time China had sent spy balloons to the United States, this one has appeared to remain over the country for longer. Still, a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the balloon did not pose a military or physical threat and added that it had limited value in collecting intelligence. Another defense official said the Pentagon did not think that the balloon added much value over what China could glean through satellite imagery.\n\n>\tPentagon officials said the balloon had traveled from China to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and through northwest Canada over the past few days before arriving somewhere over Montana, where it was hovering on Wednesday.\n\n>\tCanada\u2019s Department of National Defense said in a brief statement late Thursday that the movements of a high-altitude surveillance balloon were being \u201cactively tracked\u201d by the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which is part of the U.S.-Canada military partnership. It added that the country\u2019s intelligence agencies were working with American partners to \u201ctake all necessary measures to safeguard Canada\u2019s sensitive information from foreign intelligence threats.\u201d\n\n>\t\u201cCanadians are safe, and Canada is taking steps to ensure the security of its airspace, including the monitoring of a potential second incident,\u201d the statement said, without elaborating.\n\n>\tThe Department of National Defense did not explain where or when the balloon had been spotted, where it might be heading or whether it was the same balloon that appeared high above Montana. It also did not explain the reference to a \u201cpotential second incident.\u201d Officials with the department did not immediately respond to emails or phone calls seeking clarification.\n\n>\tAfter initially telling a news conference that it had to check on the claims about the balloon, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that it was an innocent mistake.\n\n>\t\u201cThe airship is from China. It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes,\u201d an unnamed spokesperson for the ministry said in a statement on its website. \u201cAffected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure,\u201d referring to a violation caused by forces beyond a party\u2019s control.\n\n>\tIt was unclear what China was looking for in Montana, but the state is home to the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, one of three American Air Force bases that operate and maintain intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n>\tBrig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters that the balloon was traveling \u201cwell above commercial air traffic,\u201d adding that \u201conce the balloon was detected, the U.S. government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.\u201d He did not specify what those measures were.\n\n>\tThe Pentagon sent F-22 fighter jets to track the balloon Wednesday, leading to flights being temporarily grounded at the Billings airport, the senior defense official said, but decided against shooting down the balloon.\n\n>\tSecretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III called a meeting of senior military and defense officials on Wednesday to discuss how to handle the situation, the officials said.\n\n>\tSenior Biden administration officials called their Chinese counterparts with urgency using multiple channels and conveyed the seriousness of the issue, the senior defense official said during a briefing at the Pentagon.\n\n>\tChina has several satellites that orbit around 300 miles above the earth. Like American spy satellites, the Chinese satellites can take pictures and monitor weapons launches, officials said. Both countries have a history of spying on each other; American officials visiting China on diplomatic missions routinely expect that their conversations will be monitored.\n\n>\tThe Pentagon assessed that the spy balloon \u201cdid not provide anything that \u2018other\u2019 Chinese collections did not already provide them,\u201d Michael P. Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, C.I.A. officer and Marine, said in a text message. \u201cThis was likely a reference to Chinese spy satellites.\u201d\n\n>\tThe revelation comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington have been on the rise. On Thursday, the Defense Department said the U.S. military was expanding its presence in the Philippines, as part of what military analysts said was an effort to constrain China\u2019s armed forces and bolster the United States\u2019 ability to defend Taiwan.\n\n>\tThe Biden administration has aggressively moved to check China\u2019s ability to further its technological and military ambitions, drawing fiery rebukes from Beijing. The Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and what U.S. officials view as China\u2019s permissive stance toward it \u2014 has also strained relations. But by far the most fraught issue between the two powers is Taiwan.\n\n>\tMr. Blinken has rallied allies and partners to denounce China\u2019s actions in Taiwan. At the same time, he is a proponent of Mr. Biden\u2019s goal of keeping open channels of communication with China to avoid a deterioration of the relationship.\n\n>\tLawmakers were swift to call for the Biden administration to forcefully counter any threat.\n\n>\t\u201cChina\u2019s brazen disregard for U.S. sovereignty is a destabilizing action that must be addressed, and President Biden cannot be silent,\u201d Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, said in a Twitter post.\n\n>\tIn a joint statement, Representatives Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said, \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party should not have on-demand access to American airspace.\u201d The two added that the incident showed that the China threat \u201cis not confined to distant shores \u2014 it is here at home, and we must act to counter this threat.\u201d\n\n>\tOn the ground in Montana, Jeffrey Sherlock, a retired state district court judge in Helena, agreed that the balloon was a \u201cprovocative\u201d move. But he also expressed wonder that the Chinese would have been interested in his part of the country.\n\n>\t\u201cI can\u2019t believe they are spying on Billings, Mont.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much there.\u201d",

They typically last for minutes, so they're continuously fired to turn night into day. \n It's basically how most militaries performed night fighting in the modern era, especially on the defense (there are pros but more cons to use them on the attack too). \n\nOn the defensive, they're typically fired them over or even behind the defensive position so the enemy are blinded by looking at their objective, the defenders can still see and the flare light highlights the frontal portions of those facing the defenders. On the attack, they  try to put them along the avenues of approach but higher up so attackers are not blinded looking directly at them. On the attack, if they aren't planned but the defenders use them, the drill is to stop and drop prone as soon as you hear or see the flare burst and remain utterly motionless, not moving again until the flare burns out. If a continuous flare stream goes up, either mission is scrubbed, everyone starts crawling to advance, or they all get up and move and just carry out the attack knowing they'll be seen while also partly blinded.\n\nIncendiary munitions are different, those are primarily designed to light things on fire. They explode and spread the bits on fire to land and light individual fires that spread.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>All mortars and cannon artillery can fire illumination rounds, magnesium flares that open at high altitude with an attached parachute that have a certain burnout time as they slowly float to earth doing a little rocking motion that creates spooky but beautiful shadows that dance on the ground. They typically last for minutes, so they&#39;re continuously fired to turn night into day. \n It&#39;s basically how most militaries performed night fighting in the modern era, especially on the defense (there are pros but more cons to use them on the attack too). </p>\n\n<p>On the defensive, they&#39;re typically fired them over or even behind the defensive position so the enemy are blinded by looking at their objective, the defenders can still see and the flare light highlights the frontal portions of those facing the defenders. On the attack, they  try to put them along the avenues of approach but higher up so attackers are not blinded looking directly at them. On the attack, if they aren&#39;t planned but the defenders use them, the drill is to stop and drop prone as soon as you hear or see the flare burst and remain utterly motionless, not moving again until the flare burns out. If a continuous flare stream goes up, either mission is scrubbed, everyone starts crawling to advance, or they all get up and move and just carry out the attack knowing they&#39;ll be seen while also partly blinded.</p>\n\n<p>Incendiary munitions are different, those are primarily designed to light things on fire. They explode and spread the bits on fire to land and light individual fires that spread. Sometimes they can be used for obscuration or marking because the smoke from the fires can be pretty substantial (white phosphorus especially). Russia is firing them to burn out military defenders or to terrorize civilian populations in urban areas hoping that will cause govts to surrender the cities or be willing to negotiate to stop it.</p>\n</div>",

For all the \"shoot it down\" folks out there, I'm curious what the difference is between a spy balloon in the stratosphere and a spy satellite: obviously altitude,\n\nBack in the 50s when the US had a near monopoly on being able to over pass the Chinese and Soviet skies (the British had had that ability early in the 50s with the Canberra but could not keep up), Eisenhower promoted an idea called Open Skies where the US and USSR could fly over each others territory to reduce tensions. \n\nThe Soviets were sort of against it but thinking about it. The US had a wild science project it had announced to the world to try to fly a lump of instruments over the world, something called an \"artificial satellite\". There was a lot of discussion over the legality of what the US was planning to do and if it would be seen as a violation of countries air space. However Sergei Korolev had other ideas and managed to get his R7 to launch one of these first. This settled the legal argument by default. Everyone agreed orbit is beyond national territory.\n\nBut orbit is not so much about altitude as speed. If you are not moving at 7kms a second you are coming back to the ground. This means anything below about 300km will have too much atmosphere to stay up more than a few days. This is why SpaceX release their megaconstellation at 250kms-ish. If its working the motor pushes it higher, if its not working, it falls in days. \n\nSo 20kms is the maximum altitude of a jet fighter like F15 and 350kms is really the lowest you can orbit at. In between there is no law saying where national territory ends but most uses arrive at the Karman Line, a theoretic point where thrust has to take over from aerodynamics at about 100km. The US sometimes uses 80kms but that is for Noddy things like awarding astronaut wings to tourists. \n\nSo orbit was agreed by default. But orbit is a speed not an altitude, though air sets a pretty hard limit on how low you can go at that speed. There is no agreed legal upper limit but any non orbital over flight can be seen as a violation, for example a missile test. Exception exist like Shuttle would not be orbital over Canada but Canadian air traffic control was not bothered as it would be something like 80kms and hurtling at 15 000kmh or something as it shot through. \n\nLong story short, everyone is going to say 24000m is national territory as its well below what SR-71 could achieve is sustained level flight.",

The issue is complex and some parts of the ruling coalition are more ardent than others, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\n>The internal tensions reflect the international community\u2019s broader struggle to forge a common position. If Berlin can resolve its own issues, it could provide fresh momentum for discussions in the European Union and put pressure on the US to seize assets, such as central bank reserves, that have been frozen in retaliation over Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n>Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wants Russia to pay for the damages caused in Ukraine. The former co-leader of Germany\u2019s Greens, who is a longtime advocate of a tougher stance on the Kremlin, insists that seizing at least some of the frozen assets needs to be an option, officials familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.\n\n>Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who heads the pro-business Free Democrats, is more cautious. He\u2019s concerned that confiscating Russian central-bank assets could create a dangerous precedent and lead European nations and their allies into a legal quagmire, the officials said.\n\n>The EU and partners from the Group of Seven club of rich countries have frozen some \u20ac300 billion ($311 billion) in Russian central-bank reserves. The EU has also blocked around \u20ac19 billion in assets held by sanctioned Russian businessmen, although these estimates aren\u2019t complete. The assets are in limbo and can\u2019t currently be distributed. \n\n>Instead of a blanket seizure, a more sold path in legal terms could be to target assets of individuals who have been proven to be involved in Russian war crimes, one of the people said. Such cases though could take years to make their way through courts, which could reduce such an initiative to mere symbolism.\n\n>The detail of the discussions shows how the potential for asset seizures is moving beyond a theoretical debate and toward implementation, but major hurdles remain. Scholz wants any move coordinated with allies and legally tight, the people said. \n\n>\u201cThe damage is dramatic, it will cost billions and will require the entire global community to develop reasonable solutions,\u201d the German chancellor told reporters in August. \u201cIt will be a big, big task that has little to do with the Marshall Plan. It will be bigger.\u201d\n\n>Similar discussions are going on elsewhere. The EU will \u201cfind legal ways\u201d to seize Russian assets to help fund Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said, adding that the bloc would seek to create a structure to manage those funds and invest them to benefit Kyiv.\n\n>During a summit in Brussels last month, EU leaders discussed several options for using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, according to the conclusions published after the meeting.\n\n>EU leaders called on the bloc\u2019s executive arm to come up with a detailed plan, but they also stressed that any asset seizure will have to be in line with international law. They noted that the prosecution of war crimes is a concern to the international community as a whole, a hint that the EU should seek common ground with the US. \n\n>EU officials have said the 27-nation bloc, which in June formally accepted Ukraine as a candidate for membership, will contribute the bulk of overall financial assistance for Ukraine\u2019s rebuilding. The sum could exceed \u20ac500 billion and will likely trigger a contentious debate over how to raise the money.\n\n>In the US, congressional lawmakers have pressed President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to consider seizing some Russian assets by introducing legislation to authorize it in certain cases. The US administration has so far resisted those entreaties out of concern about discouraging other foreign central banks from parking assets in the US.\n\n>Confiscating central bank assets from Russia would be a rare step, but not a first. In September, the US administration decided to put $3.5 billion in Afghanistan\u2019s central bank reserves under the control of a Swiss-based oversight board that\u2019s designed to ensuring the Taliban regime doesn\u2019t get access to the money.\n\n>The funds, which the US froze after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in 2021, will be held at the Bank for International Settlements and distributed with the consent of a four-member international board. Such a process could be a blueprint for using frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine.\n\n>The Kremlin has denounced the freezing of its reserves as illegal and said it would fight any effort to seize Russian assets and use them for other purposes. \n\n>>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an international act of thievery, in violation of everything,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Oct. 31.\n\n\n\nJust to contextualize, the U.S. has spent just shy of $30 billion in direct security aid to Ukraine since Feb 24, which would represent only 10% of Russia's assets that have been frozen.

These centrifuges produce high-enriched uranium up to 60% and are located at the Fordow Enrichment Plant.\nAs stated by the Agency, this unnotified change is inconsistent with Iran's obligations under its NPT-required Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. Such lack of required notification undermines the Agency\u2019s ability to maintain timely detection at Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The newly reported change in configuration of centrifuge cascades used to produce near-weapons-grade uranium underscores the need for Iran to meet all its safeguards reporting obligations and to accept whatever safeguards monitoring the IAEA sees as necessary in light of Iran\u2019s production of such highly enriched Uranium.\nIranian claims that this action was carried out in error are inadequate. We judge Iran\u2019s actions based on the impartial and objective reports of the IAEA, not Iran\u2019s purported intent.\nWe recall that the production of high-enriched uranium by Iran at the Fordow Enrichment Plant carries significant proliferation-related risks and is without any credible civilian justification.\nIran\u2019s actions are all the more concerning since it has stopped the implementation of its commitments on transparency and verification under the JCPOA, including implementation of its Additional Protocol, for close to two years. Iran has also offered no credible answer yet to the IAEA\u2019s outstanding questions as part of the IAEA\u2019s safeguards investigation, despite the adoption of two resolutions on this issue by the Board of Governors last year.\nWe call on Iran to comply with all its legally-binding international obligations under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA and to fully cooperate with the Agency in the application of effective safeguards at Fordow.",

If they're lucky they have a CROW remotely operated MG, which fixes some of that but, fun fact, isn't armored even against a pellet gun. The rest of the occupants are along for the ride, and if they stop they have to carefully climb down steps to get out of a single door to exit. \n\n4x4 MRAPs have absolutely terrible ground pressure and bad flotation in mud, snow, sand.

Landmines definitely are an *enormous* threat to the UAF in eastern Ukraine, and that's pretty widely recognized and discussed. It's probably second only to Russian artillery in terms of its effectiveness. The Ukrainians do not have a full complement of heavy assault engineering vehicles, so assaulting across minefields is often not an option or needs to be done with substandard/not-fit-for-purpose equipment. I don't think the Russians would have been able to stabilize the lines after Kharkiv and Kherson without having laid down massive numbers of mines to reinforce their defensive positions.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/russian-landmines-ukraine-psychological-warfare/",

During the call, Trump pushed Zelenskyy to investigate the son of then-candidate Joe Biden, Hunter, and his business ties in the country, and was accused of using U.S. military assistance as a lever.\n\n>As a private citizen over the past year, Vindman watched the slow Russian buildup along Ukraine\u2019s borders and, he said, became concerned about how Kyiv would support and sustain a long conflict. Vindman and his twin brother Yevgeny, also an Army officer, were born in Ukraine and immigrated to the U.S. as children.\n\n>**Since the invasion last year, the Biden administration has approved hundreds of Bradley fighting vehicles, Strykers, Humvees, mobile howitzer systems and now Abrams tanks for shipment to Ukraine. But those machines must be taken from Ukraine to Poland or other NATO countries for major repairs, costing Ukrainian forces weeks as they wait for their armored vehicles to come back.**\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ve got all sorts of resources going into depots and advanced bases in Poland, mainly, and inside Ukraine basically they\u2019re on their own,\u201d Vindman said in an interview. It\u2019s something he hopes to change in the coming weeks if the money, the support and the workers can be lined up.\n\n>**Right now, for minor repairs and basic maintenance, Ukrainian troops can call American troops on standby in Poland who can walk the Ukrainians through repairs via secure telephone and video links, a process the Pentagon says is working well.**\n\n>**But it\u2019s not a panacea for all the problems, with battle damage and wear and tear as howitzers and vehicles are ridden to their breaking points in hard combat.** The government in Kyiv has welcomed virtually all Western help, and with the new influx of more advanced equipment just before what is expected to be another spring and summer of brutal fighting, the experienced hands close to the front could help keep that equipment in the fight.\n\n>Vindman\u2019s group has secured enough private funding to launch a pilot project in March, and has some backing from at least one company, which declined to be named but confirmed to POLITICO their interest in getting parts and material to Ukraine for more rapid repairs.\n\n>**The plan is to find 100 to 200 experienced contractors who would travel to Ukraine and embed themselves with small units near the front lines. Under the project, called Trident Support, those contractors would in turn teach the Ukrainian troops how to fix their equipment on the fly.**\n\n>The Biden administration has long tried to dissuade Americans from going to Ukraine, but private efforts like this are still possible with the blessing of the Ukrainian government. There is also a pool of thousands of non-American mechanics qualified to work on U.S. and NATO equipment who could be recruited.\n\n>The presence of U.S. citizens on the ground providing military logistics support would likely be a new irritant to the Kremlin, and any injuries, deaths, or capture of Americans by Russian forces would be a black eye for the White House as it works to keep congressional support for arming Ukraine. Yet the amount of foreign equipment pouring into the country \u2014 with more expected \u2014 means taking some risks in order to keep that machinery humming.\n\n>\u201cThere is absolutely a way to do this and secure American contractors or Western defense contractors in-country,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cYou could do this using what we call \u2018third country nationals\u2019 where it\u2019s not American.\u201d\n\n>There are already a handful of contractors working on systems donated by their countries inside Ukraine, but those Polish and Czech mechanics are relatively few in number and go for short stints only.\n\n>\u201cThe biggest challenges are that the U.S. government currently is deeply reluctant to put defense contractors on the ground,\u201d Vindman said. \u201cThat means that people are getting paid to repair stuff in Poland, but that doesn\u2019t satisfy the warfighting capability of the Ukrainians. So this would be a kind of a policy change.\u201d\n\n>**There is no talk of trying to replicate the massive effort the U.S. ran in Iraq and Afghanistan, where at times there were more contractors fixing vehicles, cooking food and running communications systems than troops doing the fighting.**\n\n>**\u201cIf you\u2019re doing this smartly, and you\u2019re distributing five or six facilities [in Ukraine], you could do this for about 150 to 200 mechanics,\u201d spread out at various locations across the front, Vindman said.**\n\n>**Part of the reason for the smaller-scale operation is the fact that any large depot with a visible manufacturing capability would be an obvious target for Russian drones and artillery. Russian strikes hit the Ukrainian manufacturing sector hard in the opening weeks of the war, particularly plants focused on the defense industry.**\n\n>**Another is the simple problem of throughput. Material is stacking up in Poland at repair facilities, and it\u2019s much harder to get that equipment over the border in significant quantities on a regular basis, given the limits of trucking and rail capacity.**\n\n>One employee of a non-profit organization in Ukraine who has done similar work in other conflict zones said that in Ukraine, \u201cit\u2019s a really complex system and the structure for tracking logistics is spread very thin right now because they\u2019re fighting.\u201d\n\n>\u201cI do not see the large logistics companies that have had experience in other areas transporting stuff in and out, or really helping out on that level in Ukraine,\u201d said the person, who requested anonymity due to ongoing contracts in Ukraine.\n\n>Doing that work inside Ukraine could save time and start the process of getting the Ukrainians up to speed on fixing equipment that the country will likely need to maintain for years to come.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but not an intractable problem,\u201d said Ken Letcher, a retired Army colonel who specialized in logistics. The U.S. spent two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan supplying equipment across the globe and training locals to do the work for themselves.\n\n>**Letcher is helping on the project, which he said is seen as \u201ca fairly finite requirement of 12 to 18 months. At some point either after the Ukrainians are caught up on maintenance, this capability would stand down, or at some point after the war, it is then handed over.\u201d**\n\n>While some of the larger, more complicated work will still have to be done in large depots in Poland and the Czech Republic, \u201cin the meantime the Ukrainian army needs to create such a hub in Ukraine itself,\u201d said Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at Ukraine\u2019s National Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n>**\u201cSince we managed to create [Humvee] maintenance in Ukraine with the involvement of private funds, the next level of maintenance is something we might dare to do in future,\u201d with other vehicles and weapons systems, he said.**\n\n>Vindman, for his part, said that while the repair project is a philanthropic effort at the moment, \u201cthis may become a viable business with government support.\u201d\n\n>\u201cBut we aren\u2019t holding our breath or waiting for permission,\u201d he added.",

Material is stacking up in Poland at repair facilities, and it\u2019s much harder to get that equipment over the border in significant quantities on a regular basis, given the limits of trucking and rail capacity.</strong></p>\n\n<p>One employee of a non-profit organization in Ukraine who has done similar work in other conflict zones said that in Ukraine, \u201cit\u2019s a really complex system and the structure for tracking logistics is spread very thin right now because they\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI do not see the large logistics companies that have had experience in other areas transporting stuff in and out, or really helping out on that level in Ukraine,\u201d said the person, who requested anonymity due to ongoing contracts in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Doing that work inside Ukraine could save time and start the process of getting the Ukrainians up to speed on fixing equipment that the country will likely need to maintain for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but not an intractable problem,\u201d said Ken Letcher, a retired Army colonel who specialized in logistics. The U.S. spent two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan supplying equipment across the globe and training locals to do the work for themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Letcher is helping on the project, which he said is seen as \u201ca fairly finite requirement of 12 to 18 months. At some point either after the Ukrainians are caught up on maintenance, this capability would stand down, or at some point after the war, it is then handed over.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>While some of the larger, more complicated work will still have to be done in large depots in Poland and the Czech Republic, \u201cin the meantime the Ukrainian army needs to create such a hub in Ukraine itself,\u201d said Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at Ukraine\u2019s National Institute for Strategic Studies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cSince we managed to create [Humvee] maintenance in Ukraine with the involvement of private funds, the next level of maintenance is something we might dare to do in future,\u201d with other vehicles and weapons systems, he said.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vindman, for his part, said that while the repair project is a philanthropic effort at the moment, \u201cthis may become a viable business with government support.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut we aren\u2019t holding our breath or waiting for permission,\u201d he added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
