Here is an analysis that I have written about the battle of Lashio, which is a crucial moment in the Myanmar Civil war.\n\n# The First Major Climax of Operation 1027\n\nThe Battle of Lashio marks a critical moment in the Myanmar Civil War, highlighting the strategic significance of Lashio, a key city that serves as the gateway to northern Shan State and a vital military hub for the Tatmadaw. As the headquarters for the Northeastern Command, Lashio was central to overseeing military operations across a vast region stretching from the Mandalay Region to the Chinese border. It is notably the first regional command center to fall to rebel forces during the entire conflict.\n\nThe capture of Lashio by the Three Brotherhood Alliance dealt a significant blow to the junta, effectively cutting off its control over northern Shan State and crippling its ability to project power in the region. This defeat not only shifted the balance of power but also exposed the Myanmar military\u2019s vulnerabilities, despite its superior weaponry and resources.\n\nThe loss of Lashio has broader strategic implications for the junta, as it eliminates a crucial command and control center, weakening the military\u2019s hold on the northern part of the country. Regaining this territory will be challenging, if not impossible, for the foreseeable future. Casualty figures are still being assessed, but estimates suggest both sides suffered heavy losses, with fatalities likely in the hundreds and thousands more wounded. Additionally, approximately 4,000 Tatmadaw soldiers surrendered.\n\nThe fall of Lashio raises serious questions about the future viability of the military regime, particularly the leadership of SAC Chairman Min Aung Hlaing.\n\n# The Junta\u2019s Failed Strategy to Contain the EOAs\n\nThe Tatmadaw\u2019s strategy to contain the Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) in northern Shan State relied heavily on military force and attempts at diplomatic manipulation. The key objective of sowing division among the various armed groups failed entirely. Despite efforts to exploit potential rifts, the MNDAA, TNLA, and their allies remained working as an effectively unified front.\n\nTactically, the Tatmadaw\u2019s reliance on air superiority and heavy artillery proved ineffective against the guerrilla tactics and strong local support enjoyed by the EAOs. The fall of Lashio has left the military leadership in disarray, forcing a reevaluation of their strategies. In the mountainous regions of Myanmar, it is increasingly clear that the SAC\u2019s current approach is unlikely to yield any significant successes.\n\n# Strategic Impact on Ethnic Armed Organizations\n\nWith the fall of Lashio, the Tatmadaw's supply lines in Northern Shan State have been severely disrupted, making the fall of the encircled Muse appear inevitable. Given the junta's heavy pressure on multiple other fronts, any significant offensive in the Shan States is currently out of the question. We might be nearing the point where the SAC gives up the outer regions completely and concentrates it's defense on the Bamar heartland.\n\nThe MNDAA has emerged as the clear winner of the Battle of Lashio, now controlling most of the city and capturing valuable equipment. By securing Lashio, they have not only shortened and secured their own supply lines but also created opportunities for future offensives to the east and southeast, with Hsipaw likely to be the next target. The Mandalay region, already pressured from the north by PDF forces, has now a more open flank in the east. Pyin Oo Lwin is the last big layer of defense in that direction and TNLA forces are already staning in Nawnghkio, which is just 50km from Pyin Oo Lwin.\n\nBeyond the tactical advantages, the victory at Lashio is a major propaganda boost for the MNDAA. Their success has elevated their status among Myanmar's ethnic armed groups, increasing their influence in the region. This enhanced reputation will be crucial for recruitment and for future negotiations with both China and the SAC.\n\nThe TNLA also stands to benefit significantly from this victory. With Lashio no longer a threat, their frontline has been considerably shortened. Recent successes in Kyaukme and Kyauk Hle Bein have allowed them to expand their control and concentrate their forces more effectively. As mentioned above, the TNLA recently took Nawnghkio and is now standing approaching the border of the Mandalay region.\n\nIf either TNLA or MNDAA will ever move beyond the border of the Shan State remains to be seen. For decades, their leadership has been focused on specific Shan territories and it seems unlikely that they go beyond that even if an opportunity arises on the grounds. The most likely course of action is to fully expand their control up to the border and then either negotiate a cease-fire or freeze the line of contact. Either option will effectively achieve their long-term goals of establishing and administering independent states within a state.\n\nWith numerous armed groups operating in Shan State, attention is almost certainly increasingly turning to the post-SAC landscape. Internal conflicts over control and borders seem inevitable, and each organization will need to develop strategies to establish and defend their areas of interest.\n\n#",

While officially maintaining a stance of neutrality, the UWSA's actions during and after the battle reveal their strategic interests in the region. As the conflict intensified, the UWSA deployed troops into Lashio on July 29, likely to protect their significant economic and political interests in the city. This move also served to prevent potential damage to UWSA assets from ongoing military clashes and airstrikes.\n\nThe UWSA\u2019s intervention in Lashio demonstrates their growing influence and power in northern Shan State. By positioning themselves as mediators, particularly in the conflict between the TNLA and SSA-North, the UWSA managed to stabilize tensions and expand their control over key territories.\n\nThe military situation gives the UWSA a significant amount of leverage even though they're not actively fighting. For both, the 3BHA and the SAC it would be catastrophic to open a new front with the UWSA, so they avoid provoking them into a fight. The UWSA uses this leverage to make territorial gains without being directly drawn into the war.\n\nChina, which holds significant sway over the UWSA, likely welcomed their involvement in Lashio. The UWSA\u2019s actions align with Beijing\u2019s broader goal of maintaining stability in the region to protect Chinese investments and trade routes. As the conflict continues, the UWSA is expected to further consolidate its territorial control, potentially emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the shifting power dynamics in Myanmar. Their close ties with China and the Brotherhood Alliance position them well to navigate the complex and evolving landscape of Myanmar\u2019s civil war.\n\n# \n\nChina's Role in the Battle of Lashio\n\n    There is a separate and more detailed article about this topic .here\n\nChina\u2019s staregic interests in Myanmar can be distilled into three main goals: stabilizing border regions to prevent a refugee crisis, protecting its investments and economic interests, and preventing the emergence of a Western ally on its doorstep.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, China has engaged with both the State Administration Council (SAC) and Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) in Myanmar's border regions. Initially, Beijing focused on stabilizing the situation, frequently using its influence to broker ceasefires. During the Battle of Lashio, China reportedly pressured the MNDAA into a one-sided, four-day ceasefire in an attempt to halt the fighting.\n\nHowever, as the SAC continues to lose ground, China's strategy appears to be shifting. Beijing is increasingly building strong ties with key EAOs across the border, supporting them in stabilizing and administering their territories. In return, China secures a stable border, continued access to resources like timber, jade, and gold, and reduces the flow of drugs from Myanmar into China.\n\nThis evolving military situation in Myanmar also allows China to deepen the dependence of both the junta and the ethnic armies on Beijing's support, furthering China's long-term strategic goals in the region.",

They are not and have never been truly neutral. \n\n> Over the last decade, the UWSA has reportedly sold a variety of munitions to allies of the so-called Northern Alliance comprised of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), the Arakan Army (AA) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). \n\n> In addition to Chinese-designed Type-81 assault rifles that the UWSA manufactures and markets itself, these transferred weapons have included Chinese-manufactured 107mm rockets, Type-69 rocket propelled grenade launchers and 12.7 millimeter M-99 sniper rifles which have been used to lethal effect by the MNDAA and AA in particular.\n\n> In recent months, Asian intelligence officials and well-placed ethnic sources have confirmed to Asia Times that much of the Chinese weaponry purchased by the UWSA since 2011 has been channeled through neighboring Laos.

As a\u00a0<a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/w121KmzxzOzwCIMHF4JVLA\">MNDAA strategist</a>\u00a0noted in an online essay: If the MNDAA \u201cdoes not capture Lashio, Laukkai [Kokang] will never be safe.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The junta\u2019s moves also generated concerns for China and the most powerful of the EAOs, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which has long purported to remain neutral in conflicts in lower Burma. While the UWSA has cemented a strong security alliance with other northern EAOs, it also has significant economic ties with the military. Neither the Chinese nor the UWSA want to see major conflict erupt among the members of the FPNCC because of the possible effect on broader stability in the border region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Ukraine's annual electricity consumption is 85 TWh, that is on average 10 GW of power all across the year, with likely peaks of 20+GWs during the winter.\n\nTo cover 10% of that annual consumption with renewable energy would take an investment in the ballpark of 10 billion EUR. It takes years to get the necessary planning, permits, financing and construction. 7 years is what the best renewable projects take from conception to production (grid scale).\n\nAnd batteries cost at best around 1MEUR/MW, so in order to have 1hour of average consumption worth of batteries in the grid would take another 10 billion EUR. 1 hour!

Vital for the state to provide its services and to continue to exist.</p>\n\n<p>It is not a solution and can not be the solution to the general energy and power reserve deficit Ukraine is facing, especially in the short term (next few years i.e during the war). Ukraine&#39;s annual electricity consumption is 85 TWh, that is on average 10 GW of power all across the year, with likely peaks of 20+GWs during the winter.</p>\n\n<p>To cover 10% of that annual consumption with renewable energy would take an investment in the ballpark of 10 billion EUR. It takes years to get the necessary planning, permits, financing and construction. 7 years is what the best renewable projects take from conception to production (grid scale).</p>\n\n<p>And batteries cost at best around 1MEUR/MW, so in order to have 1hour of average consumption worth of batteries in the grid would take another 10 billion EUR. 1 hour! This is not a scalable solution.</p>\n</div>",

Because the Google Sheets the AFU uses publicly (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ajxXMyo-gClcmknxy2DxRNQ7ANE8KwJTNlsUuuH6Dp0/edit?gid=0#gid=0\">link for anyone interested</a>) has that comment and the math lines up almost perfectly (within 1k KIA) around that date. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to know how many KIAs the AFU estimates, you take the current published casualty count minus 63800 and divide by 3, then add the 63800 that was deducted. For the date Zelensky made the statement, that&#39;s 179 140 KIAs (like I said, within 1k of what he said). For today, it&#39;s 240 253 KIA.</p>\n</div>",

Is it fair to say that the Kursk offensive has so far been far more succesful than the Russian Kharkiv one, or is my reasoning flawed in comparing terrain controlled?</p>\n</div>",

They don't know everything. But nobody knows everything in this war.\n\nAs for drones, from our warped outside perspective, we would expect quadcopters flying all over the place. That's not how RU survalence works this far behind the front line. The average quadcopter doesn\u2019t have that kind of range. The drones that would be around Pokrovsky would be high altitude, fixed wing, Orlan/Zala drones. They are incredibly difficult to spot from the ground under the best of conditions. That's why both sides have been using them to such good effect.\n\nThe lack of caution is neither here nor there. The footage is geolocated in Pokrovsky which is relatively far from the front line, but is the attack vector for RU forces. Human beings are very bad at staying on high aleart for extended periods of time, especially when they are coming from areas of relatively higher danger. It takes a very high amount of training and discipline to keep soldiers vigilant on all areas of the front. UA\u2019s troop quality at this point in the war is inconsistent at best.\n\nIn any case, I don't need a reporter to tell me that the I situation is dire. I can see RU\u2019s momentum in this direction on Deepstatemaps. I can see that this critical position has already been subjected to heavy shelling/bombing.

But there is no strategic weakness that can be exploited for more gains now, unlike during the Kharkiv offensive when the Russians had a manpower problem.\n\nI agree in terms of anything really dramatic, but if it's within Ukraine's capabilities - and it probably isn't, but it might be - there would be real advantages to taking Rylsk and Korenovo, leaving a shortened, well connected, defensible front line running Ulanove-Rylsk-Korenovo-Sudzha.",
