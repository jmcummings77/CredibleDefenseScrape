Days later, the US president relented and agreed to let allies train Ukrainian pilots on F-16s and its array of weapon systems.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, The Telegraph reported that Mr Biden is lining up Ursula von der Leyen, the EU\u2019s top official, to replace Mr Stoltenberg.</p>\n\n<p>The report came as Mr Stoltenberg\u2019s mandate was extended until October 2024, a similar time to when the former German defence minister\u2019s term as the head of the European Commission ends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems like the US didn&#39;t like the UK taking the initiative on the F-16s, although I&#39;m sure Ukraine will be grateful for decades to come. Also, Stoltenberg might be succeeded by von der Leyen. At least the dates agree.</p>\n</div>",

Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime has also deployed those engines in its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear warheads to the US mainland.\n\n>The rocket failed when the second stage engine did not ignite, North Korea said. The third stage contained the spy satellite. Its recovery is likely to provide information on the resolution of a camera that it carried.\n\n>Last month South Korea released photos of a 14.5-meter (48 feet) portion of the North Korean rocket. The two pieces it recovered in waters about 70 meters deep were from the second stage and likely contained the engine that did not fire, weapons experts said.\n\n>Sejin Kwon, a professor of aerospace engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, said even though South Korea has discounted the technology of the salvaged satellite, the outside world shouldn\u2019t underestimate North Korea.\n\n>\u201cThis is the very first spy satellite Pyongyang has launched, and shortcomings are understandable,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cYet the fact that the North, which has no contacts with outside, has reached this level of space tech is worth appraising.\u201d\n\n>He added that it\u2019s a matter of time before North Korea raises its game with reconnaissance, \u201csince they have no other choice.\u201d\n\n>David Schmerler, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said if North Korea can launch and place an imaging satellite into orbit, it would likely use those images to refine its targeting list.\n\n>North Korea has said it wants to use spy satellites to keep an eye on military facilities in South Korea and Japan, where the US positions tens of thousands of military personnel.\n\n>North Korea is barred by United Nations Security Council resolutions from conducting ballistic missile tests, but Pyongyang has long claimed it\u2019s entitled to a civilian space program for satellite launches. The US and its partners have warned that technology derived from North Korea\u2019s space program could be used to advance its ballistic missiles.\n\n>Under Kim, North Korea has been increasing the domestic technology and components that go into its newest array of missiles.

We can&#39;t tally the score until the dust settles.</p>\n</div>",

However, allied planes are *not* completely within their rights to harras unauthorised aircraft. Ironically enough they are within their rights to \"and worse\", with prior warning, as the Syrian government is entitled to full control of their sovereign air space under international air law -- it's unsafe manoeuvres that are usually forbidden.\n\nFirst of all, within the Syrian theatre specifically, Russia and the US have coordinated flights based on special negotiated protocols for several years now. Things have been deteriorating at least since April, when Russian forces [stopped observing](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2023/04/russian-warplanes-are-trying-dogfight-us-jets-over-syria-general-says/385736/) these protocols. However, they have not denounced them so far -- they're still binding, but after an incident, Russia claims they don't apply in the particular area of that incident.\n\nThe fact that this is Syrian air space is quite clearly irrelevant for the Russian military command: Russia has observed these protocols, and coordinated flights through Syrian air space, for eight years now. They are certainly within their rights to denounce these protocols, but so far they haven't.\n\nSecond, even in the absence of these specific protocols, international legislation about intercepting a plane that enters a sovereign air space without authorisation prescribes a completely different course. The details vary with national legislation but generally, an intercepting airplane is supposed to establish contact with the unauthorised airplane and escort it out of the airspace. If it doesn't comply, depending on sovereign legislation, and under specific circumstances (i.e. when it's possible to guarantee the safety of civilian objectives, or when protecting them against an imminent threat is paramount) it can do a bunch of other things, including firing warning shots, or even shooting to take it down.\n\nThe closest thing that comes to \"harassing\" an unauthorised plane are some manoeuvres that are done once the plane has been intercepted. US legislation, which is sort of on the aggressive side, allows for direct course interception or firing flares, but requires that the airplane maintain a distance of at least 30 metres, so as not to impede the safety of the other aircraft or the pilot/operator's ability to fly out of the airspace they're violating.\n\nNational legislation applying in each country varies but harrassing -- firing afterburners right in front of the unauthorised aircraft, dropping parachute flares -- is absolutely off the table under basically every legislation, because it's impossible to control the general area where the unauthorised airplane is destroyed. \n\nSo actually, no, when American UAVs fly over Syrian territory, Russian Air Force airplanes are very much not within their rights to perform this sort of manoeuvre around it, because 1) the Russian military command in Syria has agreements in place with the US military command saying they aren't supposed to and 2) because it's unsafe (and I bet it's actually illegal under Syrian legislation; I can't find it anywhere but I'd be extremely surprised if it allowed this sort of thing which is forbidden practically everywhere). This isn't Top Gun. There's lots of boring bureaucracy in place precisely in order to ensure that encounters like these result in extremely boring outcomes rather than a sequel whose plot revolves around international nuclear war.\n\nThis is just more Russian impotent petulance. First off, they have agreements in place that they won't attack or interfere with American UAVs, which no one forced them to sign, and which they've gladly upheld for eight years. Presumably, they didn't just get the news that the Syrian government has sovereign rights over Syrian air space -- if it hasn't been a problem for eight years, it's clearly not a problem now. Furthermore, according to Syrian legislation they are in fact very much within their rights to destroy foreign UAVs. But they won't do it because they are very much afraid of the consequences. So instead they try to trigger various types of in-flight incidents so as to maintain some general plausible deniability about the nature of an eventual aircraft crash (\"we did not attack the drone, this was an accident, an in-flight collision\").",

Wang Yi telling Japanese and Koreans \u2018you can never become an American,\u2019 is that Japanese and Koreans become Americans every day,\u201d wrote Jeff M.

Again,\u201d Smith wrote.  \n>  \n>There are millions of U.S. citizens of Chinese, Japanese and Korean heritage.  \n>  \n>Some commentators also noted that Wang\u2019s comments were reminiscent of Japan\u2019s 20th century \u201cGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,\u201d essentially a front for its bid to conquer much of the continent and supplant Western influence.  \n>  \n>In his speech and in later comments, Wang papered over historical and current differences among the three countries. China fought against South Korea on behalf of North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, and still bears strong resentment toward Japan over its brutal World War II invasion and occupation of much of China.\n\nI am little high but checked several times and my senses are not lying to me. Let me say this as politely and credibly as I can, but why does China have the dumbest diplomats? Why are they so crude and bullying? Wang Yi is saying to them that any issues they have are basically fake and USA brainwashed them into thinking it. Like they can't think and have their own agency. How does he think this is helpful? How does a diplomat think lecturing others that they are brainwashed puppets is a smart strategy for achieving your goals? And this is at the meeting itself, they are already in the room with you. Why are you spiting in their face? Don't get me wrong, I understand that economic motivation is always the primary driver but negotiating team being extremely bad can also negatively affect these things.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, these is practically a weekly things with Chinese diplomats. I think Russian diplomacy is a poor replacement for that of Soviets but even they know when to use the carrot and when to use the stick, but all Chinese diplomats know is to insult and lecture someone when they have an issue with them. Like this is not rocket science (something which China is much better at), rarely you see such diplomatic incompetence from any country. I am mean one of the only figures I can think of that was this incompetent is Trump but his own diplomats never acted this way, they were always polite and goal-oriented.\n\nIt's amazing how history repeats itself. They act practically like late-era Ming Dynasty, expecting all the tributaries to kowtow to them. But China didn't used to be this way, a decade ago they had normal diplomats like everyone else. It's as if they bought into the inevitability of \"China's Rise\" so strongly that they think it's irrelevant if they act like Ming Dynasty or not. But China is not in that position, the world doesn't need to bow to them and acting this way only hurts the possibility of it happening in the future.\n\nI also want to highlight the polar opposite nature of American/Chinese politics. American politics is so farcical you sometimes feel like you are watching reality show but diplomatically America very measured and smart. In contrast Chinese politicians are extremely uncontroversial and dull, they have never said anything noteworthy or controversial since Deng, but the diplomats are these fire breeders that are at times indistinguishable from QAnon types. Idk, it's like a release mechanism for each country.",

Again,\u201d Smith wrote.  </p>\n\n<p>There are millions of U.S. citizens of Chinese, Japanese and Korean heritage.  </p>\n\n<p>Some commentators also noted that Wang\u2019s comments were reminiscent of Japan\u2019s 20th century \u201cGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,\u201d essentially a front for its bid to conquer much of the continent and supplant Western influence.  </p>\n\n<p>In his speech and in later comments, Wang papered over historical and current differences among the three countries. China fought against South Korea on behalf of North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, and still bears strong resentment toward Japan over its brutal World War II invasion and occupation of much of China.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am little high but checked several times and my senses are not lying to me. Let me say this as politely and credibly as I can, but why does China have the dumbest diplomats? Why are they so crude and bullying? Wang Yi is saying to them that any issues they have are basically fake and USA brainwashed them into thinking it. Like they can&#39;t think and have their own agency. How does he think this is helpful? How does a diplomat think lecturing others that they are brainwashed puppets is a smart strategy for achieving your goals? And this is at the meeting itself, they are already in the room with you. Why are you spiting in their face? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand that economic motivation is always the primary driver but negotiating team being extremely bad can also negatively affect these things.</p>\n\n<p>This is not an isolated incident, these is practically a weekly things with Chinese diplomats. I think Russian diplomacy is a poor replacement for that of Soviets but even they know when to use the carrot and when to use the stick, but all Chinese diplomats know is to insult and lecture someone when they have an issue with them. Like this is not rocket science (something which China is much better at), rarely you see such diplomatic incompetence from any country. I am mean one of the only figures I can think of that was this incompetent is Trump but his own diplomats never acted this way, they were always polite and goal-oriented.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s amazing how history repeats itself. They act practically like late-era Ming Dynasty, expecting all the tributaries to kowtow to them. But China didn&#39;t used to be this way, a decade ago they had normal diplomats like everyone else. It&#39;s as if they bought into the inevitability of &quot;China&#39;s Rise&quot; so strongly that they think it&#39;s irrelevant if they act like Ming Dynasty or not. But China is not in that position, the world doesn&#39;t need to bow to them and acting this way only hurts the possibility of it happening in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to highlight the polar opposite nature of American/Chinese politics. American politics is so farcical you sometimes feel like you are watching reality show but diplomatically America very measured and smart. In contrast Chinese politicians are extremely uncontroversial and dull, they have never said anything noteworthy or controversial since Deng, but the diplomats are these fire breeders that are at times indistinguishable from QAnon types. Idk, it&#39;s like a release mechanism for each country.</p>\n</div>",

The CPC finds it easier to give concessions as it believes Japan  and Korea will ultimately pick domestic growth over fighting against whatever the politburo's core geopolitical interest are at the time, whether its maintaining Taiwan ambiguity, or helping its semiconductor industry mature to state-of-the-art production. When the US leads any trade cooperative, due to its military strength and economic interests that runs contralateral to the CPC's, geo-politicking will be front-and-center of any negotiation which seriously affect the CPC's core geopolitical interests. It's a matter of China losing important economic partners that will slow its own economic growth and ability to enter advance technological fields that it views are critical for national security, economic stability and social stability.\n\nWang Yi's comment is a quiet critique of internal political discussion for the Japanese and Korean ambassadors; as both nations have had their own experiences being on the wrong end of \"\"economic coercion from the West\"\" >!(As per politburo view, not my personal)!< ; for Japan it was the effect of the Plaza Accord in 1985 forced upon them by the US government under threat of sanctions during the Reagan administration (many believe) triggered the Japanese financial crisis in the 1990's. For Korea its the lack of a real resolution for the Korean conflict and the immense control the chaebols have over the Korean government (and in turn, the US' political leverage over Korean affairs as US has a significant contribution to the Chaebol's power and wealth) >!(again, politburo view, not my personal)!<\n\nUnderstanding this context, Wang Yi's plead basically translates to this:\n\n*Westerners will never truly see you as equals, whenever you threaten their economic power they'll crush you through political coercion via trade pacts, sanctions, and talk about \"balancing trade deficits\" or use corporate interests to dominate your public policies. We'll never do that, because our secret wishes are open for all to see: we care about advancing our technologies, reuniting with Taiwan, and curtailing the America's control over us. Your best years of growth were when you worked with us and traded with us, and because of that we see you as equals. The Americans will only give enough to bait you in with a \"Chip act\" here, an \"inflation reduction act\" there. They'll never open their economy to you like we have. Lets return to peer-to-peer partnership without considering the Americans and we can all become wealthier nations because of it.*\n\nThat's at least what I understand after watching bits and pieces of the meeting.",

It&#39;s a matter of China losing important economic partners that will slow its own economic growth and ability to enter advance technological fields that it views are critical for national security, economic stability and social stability.</p>\n\n<p>Wang Yi&#39;s comment is a quiet critique of internal political discussion for the Japanese and Korean ambassadors; as both nations have had their own experiences being on the wrong end of &quot;&quot;economic coercion from the West&quot;&quot; <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">(As per politburo view, not my personal)</span> ; for Japan it was the effect of the Plaza Accord in 1985 forced upon them by the US government under threat of sanctions during the Reagan administration (many believe) triggered the Japanese financial crisis in the 1990&#39;s. For Korea its the lack of a real resolution for the Korean conflict and the immense control the chaebols have over the Korean government (and in turn, the US&#39; political leverage over Korean affairs as US has a significant contribution to the Chaebol&#39;s power and wealth) <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">(again, politburo view, not my personal)</span></p>\n\n<p>Understanding this context, Wang Yi&#39;s plead basically translates to this:</p>\n\n<p><em>Westerners will never truly see you as equals, whenever you threaten their economic power they&#39;ll crush you through political coercion via trade pacts, sanctions, and talk about &quot;balancing trade deficits&quot; or use corporate interests to dominate your public policies. We&#39;ll never do that, because our secret wishes are open for all to see: we care about advancing our technologies, reuniting with Taiwan, and curtailing the America&#39;s control over us. Your best years of growth were when you worked with us and traded with us, and because of that we see you as equals. The Americans will only give enough to bait you in with a &quot;Chip act&quot; here, an &quot;inflation reduction act&quot; there. They&#39;ll never open their economy to you like we have. Lets return to peer-to-peer partnership without considering the Americans and we can all become wealthier nations because of it.</em></p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s at least what I understand after watching bits and pieces of the meeting.</p>\n</div>",

According to Karl Hermann Frank&#39;s postwar testimony, Hitler knew Zelewski to be even harsher than Heydrich.[53] Hitler favoured killing 10,000 politically unreliable Czechs, but after he consulted Himmler, the idea was dropped because Czech territory was an important industrial zone for the German military, and indiscriminate killing could reduce the productivity of the region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This incurred costs for Germany.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, it&#39;s Russia itself that has to deal with the majority of the fallout from the dam&#39;s destruction. Shooting yourself in the foot is anything but.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It hurt the Ukranian plans to support their southern offensives as much as it hurt the Ru defences. It forced Ukraine to expend plenty of resources in rescue efforts and post disaster relief that the Russians didn&#39;t expend.  </p>\n\n<p>I think the chances of them keeping the canal running for another 3m let alone indefinitely were small in any case.</p>\n\n<p>The losses were small enough to make the strategic gesture, the &quot;even if you succeed, we will make sure you lose&quot; worth it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to send a message, it has to be unambiguous. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh, Ukraine absolutely has taken it onboard as an unambiguous message. Look at their concerns about the ZNPP now. They expect Ru to do the same there, and for the same reasons.... To show &quot;even if you beat us, you lose&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn&#39;t shooting themselves in the foot.</p>\n\n<p>It was a wounded soldier setting off a grenade and taking an enemy offering surrender with him.</p>\n</div>",

It smacks of an old-school \"Cold Warrior\" view of the Russians, which admittedly Hill is not, but that's what it reminds me of.

I imagine Hill is playing up the point for emphasis, but it still smacks of a sort of single-minded viewpoint that is not effective for explaining state or actor behavior. Mostly though I disagree because it seems to have been disproven in this conflict multiple times. Yes, Russia destroyed the dam but it took months for them to reach that point and it's not clear whether they did it out of spite or because of a half-cocked military strategy. Kherson was recaptured largely intact. The Russians gave up large amounts of ground in the Kharkiv offensive. They did not salt the earth or make it unlivable for the Ukrainians. And Hill's assessment ultimately runs up against a serious issue. It's one thing to blow up a dam, another thing entirely to trigger a nuclear catastrophe that could negatively impact you as well. If there's one thing Putin has demonstrated it's an obsessive survival instinct. At what point does spite outweigh that survival instinct?

What we can do is an exercise to guess who benefits more from the event.\n\n- Nordstream: \n\nRussia didn't want to cut the gas exports to Europe. At the time there was pressure on Germany to stop the imports. After the explosions, the exports of Russian gas to Europe go through Ukraine. And the explosions happened in Danish waters. If Russia wanted it destroyed, they wouldn't go to NATO waters to do it, they can do it closer to their coast. So, in this case, looks like Ukraine had more to win than Russia, and the latest evidence looks to point in that way.\n\n- Nova Kharkova dam: \n\nbenefits for Russia: civil&economic: cripples the Ukranian infraestrucure. From a military point of view: temporarily prevents any operations downstream.\n\nProblems for Russia: civil&economic: if they were planning to conquer the area, they just destroyed a large piece of infrastructure.\nFrom a military point of view: the flood destroyed the fixed positions prepared along the coast. In case of a major river crossing, the flooding would have been disastrous for the attacker, but when it happened nothing military important was lost for Ukraine\n\nBenefits for Ukrainie: civil& economic: none, it's a disaster. From a military point of view: the flood destroy the fixed positions downstream and also makes the river crossing much narrower in many km where the lake was.\n\nProblems for Ukrainie: civil & economic: it's a disaster. Military point of view: for a few weeks (months?) The area is not good for any heavy equipment operations.\n\nAlso, there is always the possibility of a FK up from the Russian side blowing up the mines by accident, or the dam just collapsing due to lack of maintenance due to the war. Also remember that previous to the dam collapse the upstream dams in ukranian control were releasing an unusual amount of water. As I said before, we don't know now. So far Ukrainie had more to win in a military sense but also a lot of to lose in an economic and civil, I don't know if the cost/benefit is worth it.\n\n\n- Nuclear plant attack: \n\nWhat could Russia win? Further destroying Ukranian infraestrucure, show of force in a way of saying \"See? we are not afraid of nuclear, maybe next time we rattle the nukes it will be for real\", negating a high value target for Ukraine in case of them taking the area.\n\nWhat could Russia lose? NATO triggers Article 5 (maybe a half way measure such as enforcing No fly zone? I don't know), Huge leap in western assistance to Ukraine, China  being very pissed and maybe starting to put a LOT of pressure on Russia, same with Turkey as they will be in part of the fallout. Also becoming a global pariah.\n\nWhat could Ukraine win? Well, all of the things that Russia could lose and bring the war to an end. At this stage of the war, would you trade a nuclear plant for winning the war before the end of the year? I don't know, only the Top brass and Zelensky could answer that.\n\nWhat could Ukraine lose? Well, besides THE BIGGEST NUCLEAR PLANT IN EUROPE, that we know are not particularly cheap, the fallout, the consequences of any radioactive release, and the possibility of things going out of control and a nuclear war starting, and today if even a limites nuclear exchange happens, some ukranian cities will be blasted.\n\nSo, for me, the only one who could make some sort of benefit would be Ukraine as after something like that they will promptly win the war (and I mean, pre 2004 borders), but it would be the gamble of the century. So many things can go wrong. Russia on the other hand, besides terrorism, doesn't have anything to win and a lot to lose. Again, a terrible gamble. That's why I think this will lead nowhere.",

                        "body": "Its not crying wolf, if there are wolves.\n\n**In your first link** Ukraine claimed there was a fire at the plant and it had been bombarded by Russia. So they were definitely claiming there was a wolf.\n\nIn the same article the head of the plant confirmed the fire, and the head of the IAEA said they had helped the plant \"after the attack\".\n\nGoogling it, this is the first para of an article by the \"Bulletin of Atomic Scientists\" \n\nhttps://thebulletin.org/2022/03/could-an-attack-on-ukrainian-nuclear-facilities-cause-a-disaster-greater-than-chernobyl-possibly-simulations-show/\n>As Russian military forces shelled the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in southern Ukraine on March 4, 2022, a fire broke out on the site. Among the six reactor units at the complex, auxiliary buildings attached to the Zaporizhzhya Unit 1 reactor were damaged. Fortunately, the damage did not threaten the safety of the unit.[1] \n\nSeems they cried wolf, and there was a wolf.\n\n**In your second link,** they circulated a report (which ISW believed was false) that the Ru commander of the plant \"Major General Valery Vasilev, stating that Russia had mined the Zaporizhzhia NPP and that the plant would be \u201ceither Russian land or a scorched desert.[1] \"\n\nand the ISW belief that\n\n>This likely misreporting distracts from the very real risks of Russia\u2019s militarization of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which may include mining the plant and almost certainly includes the unsafe storage of military armaments near nuclear reactors and nuclear waste storage facilities.\n\nSo, not sure they cried wolf on that occasion.... but the link itself is to ISW saying \"there are a lot of very wolfy things going on here that are extremely concerning that discussion of this, likely false,  statement detracts from\". They seem to agree the plant was in danger and may well have been mined.\n\n**In your third link** the Ukranians are saying that the Russians may destroy infrastructure as they retreat, which includes the ZNPP\n\n>It is highly likely that during the retreat, the enemy, in addition to mass evacuation, may resort to a series of terrorist attacks involving blowing up residential areas, turning the temporarily occupied territory into scorched earth and causing critical damage to the infrastructure of Ukraine\u2019s retaken territories.\n\n>Taking into account the Russian Federation\u2019s latest fake news about a so-called \u2018dirty bomb\u2019, it also cannot be ruled out that the occupiers may organise explosions at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant with the aim of finally putting it out of action and provoking a local man-made disaster, with Ukraine being accused of doing this.\n\nGiven they blew up the big Dam in Kherson, and several other smaller dams in Zapo, this does indeed seem to be what they are doing. Blowing up infrastructure as they retreat to deny areas to the enemy, and inflict maximum economic damage to territory they retreat from.\n\nSo its clear that the non-nuclear wolves they warned about in this statement were very much there. \n\nAs they have not retreated yet from ZNPP, you can't say the nuclear wolf wasn't there yet either. We will only know when they do retreat from ZNPP.\n\nSo I'm not these articles at all prove what you think they do..... if anything they 2 of 3 seem to confirm Ukraine has correctly called wolf when there were wolves, either fully or partially.... and in the 3rd one only that they were \"saying things that distracted from the real possibility Russia may mine or otherwise damage the plant\". So kinda \"Shouting lion, which detracts from the very real threat of wolves in this vicinity\".\n\nIn other \"Ukraine claiming wolf, and there actually being wolves\" incidents....\n\nIn late early 2023 Ukraine claimed Ru troops were fortifying the plant in unsafe way and placing troops in sensitive parts of the plant.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Its not crying wolf, if there are wolves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your first link</strong> Ukraine claimed there was a fire at the plant and it had been bombarded by Russia. So they were definitely claiming there was a wolf.</p>\n\n<p>In the same article the head of the plant confirmed the fire, and the head of the IAEA said they had helped the plant &quot;after the attack&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Googling it, this is the first para of an article by the &quot;Bulletin of Atomic Scientists&quot; </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/could-an-attack-on-ukrainian-nuclear-facilities-cause-a-disaster-greater-than-chernobyl-possibly-simulations-show/\">https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/could-an-attack-on-ukrainian-nuclear-facilities-cause-a-disaster-greater-than-chernobyl-possibly-simulations-show/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As Russian military forces shelled the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in southern Ukraine on March 4, 2022, a fire broke out on the site. Among the six reactor units at the complex, auxiliary buildings attached to the Zaporizhzhya Unit 1 reactor were damaged. Fortunately, the damage did not threaten the safety of the unit.[1] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems they cried wolf, and there was a wolf.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your second link,</strong> they circulated a report (which ISW believed was false) that the Ru commander of the plant &quot;Major General Valery Vasilev, stating that Russia had mined the Zaporizhzhia NPP and that the plant would be \u201ceither Russian land or a scorched desert.[1] &quot;</p>\n\n<p>and the ISW belief that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This likely misreporting distracts from the very real risks of Russia\u2019s militarization of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which may include mining the plant and almost certainly includes the unsafe storage of military armaments near nuclear reactors and nuclear waste storage facilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, not sure they cried wolf on that occasion.... but the link itself is to ISW saying &quot;there are a lot of very wolfy things going on here that are extremely concerning that discussion of this, likely false,  statement detracts from&quot;. They seem to agree the plant was in danger and may well have been mined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In your third link</strong> the Ukranians are saying that the Russians may destroy infrastructure as they retreat, which includes the ZNPP</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is highly likely that during the retreat, the enemy, in addition to mass evacuation, may resort to a series of terrorist attacks involving blowing up residential areas, turning the temporarily occupied territory into scorched earth and causing critical damage to the infrastructure of Ukraine\u2019s retaken territories.</p>\n\n<p>Taking into account the Russian Federation\u2019s latest fake news about a so-called \u2018dirty bomb\u2019, it also cannot be ruled out that the occupiers may organise explosions at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant with the aim of finally putting it out of action and provoking a local man-made disaster, with Ukraine being accused of doing this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given they blew up the big Dam in Kherson, and several other smaller dams in Zapo, this does indeed seem to be what they are doing. Blowing up infrastructure as they retreat to deny areas to the enemy, and inflict maximum economic damage to territory they retreat from.</p>\n\n<p>So its clear that the non-nuclear wolves they warned about in this statement were very much there. </p>\n\n<p>As they have not retreated yet from ZNPP, you can&#39;t say the nuclear wolf wasn&#39;t there yet either. We will only know when they do retreat from ZNPP.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m not these articles at all prove what you think they do..... if anything they 2 of 3 seem to confirm Ukraine has correctly called wolf when there were wolves, either fully or partially.... and in the 3rd one only that they were &quot;saying things that distracted from the real possibility Russia may mine or otherwise damage the plant&quot;. So kinda &quot;Shouting lion, which detracts from the very real threat of wolves in this vicinity&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>In other &quot;Ukraine claiming wolf, and there actually being wolves&quot; incidents....</p>\n\n<p>In late early 2023 Ukraine claimed Ru troops were fortifying the plant in unsafe way and placing troops in sensitive parts of the plant. More claiming existence of wolves.</p>\n\n<p>Which was confirmed in April when the UK MoD published satellite images of Ru troops having built sandbag fighting positions literally <em>on top of the reactors</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/uk-news/2023/04/27/russia-establishes-fighting-positions-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-reactors/\">https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/uk-news/2023/04/27/russia-establishes-fighting-positions-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-reactors/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cImagery shows that by March 2023, Russian forces had established sandbag fighting positions on the roofs of several of the six reactor buildings at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRussia has controlled ZNPP since March 2022.

If Beijing did at some point uses these new rules to restrict shipments and cut supply to other nations, prices would likely rise and make it more economical to boost output in Japan, Canada, the US or elsewhere.  \n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the tit-for-tat the PRC is playing with the US and its allies,\u201d said Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. He was referring to the country\u2019s formal name, the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cThere may be some initial shock to the markets and firms but over time, should these restrictions persist, markets and firms adjust.\u201d\n\n>The move underscores the dilemma facing President Xi Jinping as he seeks to counter US efforts to prevent China from accessing the chips needed to dominate technology like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Any reciprocal actions only give the US and Europe more ammunition to push for derisking, something Xi\u2019s government has sought to counter.  \n\n>That incident set off a race to find alternative supplies from China. Output in Australia and the US subsequently increased, pushing China\u2019s share of mining output down to 70% of global supply in 2022 from a peak of 98% in 2010, according to the US Geological Survey. \n\n>China currently accounts for about 94% of the world\u2019s gallium production, according to the UK Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre. Still, the metals aren\u2019t particularly rare or difficult to find, though China\u2019s kept them cheap and they can be relatively high-cost to extract.\n\n>\u201cImposing export restrictions risks reducing market dominance,\u201d researchers from Eurasia Group including Anna Ashton wrote in a note. \u201cIf implemented as is, China\u2019s new export mineral restrictions could offer fresh impetus for foreign manufacturers to shift production out of China, accelerating the trend of supply chain diversification.\u201d\n\n>The immediate effect of the changes seems to be limited, according to a statement from the Korean industry ministry on Tuesday, which noted that there are other supplies of the two metals.\n\n>However even if China doesn\u2019t use this new rule to limit exports at some point in the future, it arguably has more to lose than the US, particularly as its mounting economic challenges raise questions about whether it will ever take over as the world\u2019s biggest economy. \n\n>The two metals aren\u2019t particularly rare, but Chinese dominates processing.

If Beijing did at some point uses these new rules to restrict shipments and cut supply to other nations, prices would likely rise and make it more economical to boost output in Japan, Canada, the US or elsewhere.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the tit-for-tat the PRC is playing with the US and its allies,\u201d said Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. He was referring to the country\u2019s formal name, the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cThere may be some initial shock to the markets and firms but over time, should these restrictions persist, markets and firms adjust.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The move underscores the dilemma facing President Xi Jinping as he seeks to counter US efforts to prevent China from accessing the chips needed to dominate technology like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Any reciprocal actions only give the US and Europe more ammunition to push for derisking, something Xi\u2019s government has sought to counter.  </p>\n\n<p>That incident set off a race to find alternative supplies from China. Output in Australia and the US subsequently increased, pushing China\u2019s share of mining output down to 70% of global supply in 2022 from a peak of 98% in 2010, according to the US Geological Survey. </p>\n\n<p>China currently accounts for about 94% of the world\u2019s gallium production, according to the UK Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre. Still, the metals aren\u2019t particularly rare or difficult to find, though China\u2019s kept them cheap and they can be relatively high-cost to extract.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cImposing export restrictions risks reducing market dominance,\u201d researchers from Eurasia Group including Anna Ashton wrote in a note. \u201cIf implemented as is, China\u2019s new export mineral restrictions could offer fresh impetus for foreign manufacturers to shift production out of China, accelerating the trend of supply chain diversification.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The immediate effect of the changes seems to be limited, according to a statement from the Korean industry ministry on Tuesday, which noted that there are other supplies of the two metals.</p>\n\n<p>However even if China doesn\u2019t use this new rule to limit exports at some point in the future, it arguably has more to lose than the US, particularly as its mounting economic challenges raise questions about whether it will ever take over as the world\u2019s biggest economy. </p>\n\n<p>The two metals aren\u2019t particularly rare, but Chinese dominates processing. Japan, South Korea, Russia and Ukraine produce gallium, while the US, Canada, Belgium and Russia make germanium, according to the CRU Group, a metals industry intelligence provider. </p>\n\n<p>There are not many immediate alternatives for germanium supply, said SMM\u2019s Hu.

Fails to see this could be China&#39;s choice or explained by other reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Of all possible info he chose to ignore things that look vassal ish like selling oil below cost under very long term contracts, Russia ignoring China renaming Russian cities to Chinese names, yet going apeshit when Poland does it.</p>\n\n<p>Chooses some arbitrary criteria how a vassal relationship would look like, notes that China is interested in Russia not looking like a vassal, but fails to see how this defeats his own logic: Russia could be a vassal that it&#39;s master is interested in not looking like a vassal, so his previous superficial arguments are nullified.</p>\n</div>",

Their aircraft 80s Soviet standard. A large portion of their troops is lucky to get a 6 week boot camp in the UK, the ones doing the attacking often a couple of months training. \n\nThey are horribly short of artillery rounds, basic armoured vehicles like APCs, they just about scrape 200 modern (by modern new when Playstation One was new) IFVs such as the Bradleys, CV90s and Marders. They lack the widespread use of night vision kit that would be infantry standard, the heaviest land system they have that hits 4 figures is the hodge hodge of surplus MRAPs from the WOT. \n\nI understand that way too much hype was applied to some of this equipment. But the vintage and numbers really need to be looked at. With a few exceptions it is either surplus from stores or nearing end of life (only mobile artillery tended to be genuinely modern and in numbers).

Their aircraft 80s Soviet standard. A large portion of their troops is lucky to get a 6 week boot camp in the UK, the ones doing the attacking often a couple of months training. </p>\n\n<p>They are horribly short of artillery rounds, basic armoured vehicles like APCs, they just about scrape 200 modern (by modern new when Playstation One was new) IFVs such as the Bradleys, CV90s and Marders. They lack the widespread use of night vision kit that would be infantry standard, the heaviest land system they have that hits 4 figures is the hodge hodge of surplus MRAPs from the WOT. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that way too much hype was applied to some of this equipment. But the vintage and numbers really need to be looked at.
