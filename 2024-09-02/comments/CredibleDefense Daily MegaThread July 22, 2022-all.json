The level of logistics that would be involved in arranging that, with all the necessary materiel, personnel, space, and not to mention, permissions, if the British Army had to do that in, say, Poland, would be enormous. Not insurmountable, by any means - but certainly more expensive + difficult than just arranging for the Ukrainians to be flown into existing training sites in the UK.

Both of these aircraft carry sonobuoys for detection and generating a firing solution as well. Curiously enough the P-8 dropped the MAD boom in the US version.

The implementation of the draft is not centralized, each region's government has a quota to fullfil and everybody has their own methods, so the situation varies widely depending on the oblast. I want to emphasise that it's just my experience and may not reflect the situation elsewhere.\n\nThe region I live in basically has LDNR style mass mobilization. There are squads of policemen/soldiers that go around public spaces in the  town and hand out mobilization papers (no idea how they are called in english, but you are basically required to got to the draft office if you get one).

How much of this could effectively recuperate their forces into something capable of achieving serious offensive objectives? My guess is \"Not a lot.\" This compounds with problem #1.\n3. Manpower. Russia has something like 34,000 volunteers from Russia on the way from its \"charm offensive\" in poorer regions of the country; given the numbers for KIA and WIA that are floating around, this likely will not last past the year. However, the DNR/LNR are being thoroughly drained of men. Wagner's getting socked in the face, and the only progress of the Kadyrovites has been in the Tik Tok battlefield. These sources are drying up. Also, they can't do the same trick with the training battalions by calling them up because they already cannibalized them.

Morale. Slow, grinding warfare doesn't help anyone. But if morale was low when the initial Donbass offensive started, you can bet that it, at minimum, will not be that much better this time around. More units will likely be exhausted physically and mentally from the fighting, and just perform more poorly as a result.

            "body": "I think it's not accurate to say that Russia is losing. Frankly, from our perspective as relatively uninformed observers, the details are too scant for us to make objective pronouncements one way or another. Our information feed is almost entirely social media, speculation, and occasional tidbits from one state entity or another. In concluding whether one side is winning or not, we are essentially putting together a jigsaw puzzle without all the pieces and trying to call it complete. Russia still possesses the will to fight. Indeed, the desire of the Russian government to continue the conflict does not seem to have abated at all since the start of the war. The only thing that has shifted is their realistic goals (not necessarily their publicly stated goals, which remain exaggerated as per Lavrov's most recent statement), which have downsized, and those at least have been partially fulfilled at this stage (Luhansk is theirs, as is the land corridor to Crimea). In turn their military has been brutalized, their economy is troubled, and their reputation as a great power has certainly taken a hit. Ukraine meanwhile is suffering massive economic damage and troop losses, the latter almost as high as Russian losses if the recent statements of the CIA Director are to be believed. Ukraine is obviously not interested in negotiation or surrender and so will continue the conflict.   \n\n\nAt the end of the day, the most reasonable assumption we can make with the information available to us is that the war is close to a stalemate.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think it&#39;s not accurate to say that Russia is losing. Frankly, from our perspective as relatively uninformed observers, the details are too scant for us to make objective pronouncements one way or another. Our information feed is almost entirely social media, speculation, and occasional tidbits from one state entity or another. In concluding whether one side is winning or not, we are essentially putting together a jigsaw puzzle without all the pieces and trying to call it complete. Russia still possesses the will to fight. Indeed, the desire of the Russian government to continue the conflict does not seem to have abated at all since the start of the war. The only thing that has shifted is their realistic goals (not necessarily their publicly stated goals, which remain exaggerated as per Lavrov&#39;s most recent statement), which have downsized, and those at least have been partially fulfilled at this stage (Luhansk is theirs, as is the land corridor to Crimea). In turn their military has been brutalized, their economy is troubled, and their reputation as a great power has certainly taken a hit. Ukraine meanwhile is suffering massive economic damage and troop losses, the latter almost as high as Russian losses if the recent statements of the CIA Director are to be believed. Ukraine is obviously not interested in negotiation or surrender and so will continue the conflict.   </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, the most reasonable assumption we can make with the information available to us is that the war is close to a stalemate. Neither side is capable of making significant gains and as a result neither side is suffering significant territorial losses. It&#39;s possible something will shift that balance, maybe Western equipment or Russian reinforcements scraped from ethnic minority regions, but for now barring something that we can&#39;t really foresee, this stalemate appears to be the status quo.</p>\n</div>",

It's possible something will shift that balance, maybe Western equipment or Russian reinforcements scraped from ethnic minority regions, but for now barring something that we can't really foresee, this stalemate appears to be the status quo.\n\nI just want to chime in here with what I've maintained since February: this outcome really does amount to a loss for Russia. Their primary goal was to force a favorable political settlement and avoid a costly drawn out war. They've failed to avoid the war and they are no closer to a political settlement.\n\nThis is why the drive on Kyiv was so important. The only way to force a quick political settlement was to decapitate Ukraine's political leadership. Tactical or even strategic sucess in Donbass does not amount to a political victory unless Kyiv is somehow made to recognize those gains.\n\nIMO, it is a very baseline level of analysis to say that Russia is winning because they occupy a certain amount of Ukranians territory, or certain regional objectives. They are no closer to securing a political settlement today than they were on March 1st. The only path to a true victory for Russia would be if they can shift the strategic balance in their favor to the extent that Zelenskyy can either be removed, or forced to sign a favorable peace deal. It is very unclear whether Russia has the resources or willpower to do so.\n\nAs support, I'd compare this to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nobody would say that the US \"won\" those wars even though the US military defeated all conventional opposition and occupied 100% of territory. Why? Becuase the United States could not produce a favorable political outcome in either case. \n\nI understand the necessary obsession with battlefield-level outcomes, but anyone analyzing winning/losing without considering the geopolitical context is lacking credibility. Ukraine will not get a \"game over\" screen if Russia takes too many victory points. This is a decades long cultural conflict concerning trends that have been running away from Moscow since the USSR started failing in the 1980s. \n\nIt remains true that any true political win for Russia is so costly in men and material that it will likely be a phyrric victory. A stalemate frozen conflict with no political settlement likely does not qualify as a victory for the Kremlin even though they will declare victory. As with many wars, the cost to both sides means everybody really loses.",

Ukraine has made gains near Kherson, but a lack of a big prize (yet) or serious reserve commitments leaves the tactical initiative in Russian hands. Operationally both sides are in a tough spot. Russia did not achieve many of its more recent operational objectives, which included inflicting substantial casualties on the Ukrainians in the Donbas as well as creating a more fluid frontline. Casualties have been even, to my knowledge no large Ukrainian formations were destroyed, and the Ukrainians seem to have established a second echelon of positions which they will now fight over. But Ukraine is currently in its own tough spot, as Russia has reduced the Donbas salient they\u2019ve freed up forces for other regions or a new offensive. Meanwhile Ukraine has not show that it has the capacity to sustain a similarly large offensive. They have shown they can prevent a major breakthrough or a sudden defeat, but not that they can retake the captured territories. So that leaves the strategic picture as a big question mark. The outcome of the war almost certainly hangs on events and trends which we have not yet seen. If the war continues along this trajectory, the question is which side will break first. Neither Russia nor Ukraine seem willing to negotiate, both hold objectives that are oppositional. For Russia the best outcome is to refreeze the conflict and try again another day. For Ukraine this is the nightmare scenario. So those trends will push Ukraine, IMO, towards a counter offensive. Will it be successful? Will the western coalition hang tough that long? Will Russia? And is this conflict even \u2018freezable\u2019 or will the new Russo-Ukrainian border just bleed for the next few years?
