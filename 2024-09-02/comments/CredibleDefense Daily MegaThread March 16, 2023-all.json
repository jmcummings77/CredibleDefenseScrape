As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Out of 500 soldiers of the first formation, 100 were killed, almost 400 were wounded. In the \"Kupola\" battalion - the highest level of motivation, high trust in the commander, high-quality management - during the battles in Soledar, they had many frostbites and the soldiers had their toes amputated because they held positions until the last opportunity, without changes and even support, because such were the difficult conditions, it was from this battalion that one of the paratroopers lost 10 fingers from frostbite. They retreated on orders when the enemy actually surrounded Soledar. Therefore, to say that the \"Dome\" is looking for betrayal or is a person, which tries to evade responsibility is impossible - this officer takes responsibility upon himself. \"Kupol\" gave an interview to one of the most influential publications of the USA, \"Washington Post\", here are his quotes from the text about the organization and preparation of the Ukrainian army for the upcoming offensive:\n\n> \"We're just giving interviews and telling people we're doing our best. It's like all we're doing is giving interviews and telling people we've already won, just a little bit, two more weeks, and we will win.\n\n> I get 100 new soldiers. They don't give me time to prepare. They say: \"Lead them into battle.\" And these soldiers just drop everything and run. And that's all. Do you understand why? Because a soldier does not shoot. I ask him why, and he says: \"I'm afraid of the sound of a shot.\" And for some reason he never threw a grenade. ... We need NATO instructors in all our training centers, and our instructors need to be sent to the trenches. Because they did not cope with their task.\n\n> The most valuable thing in war is combat experience. A soldier who survived half a year of fighting and a soldier who came from the training ground are two different soldiers. This is heaven and earth. And there are very few soldiers who have combat experience. Unfortunately, many have already died or been injured.\n\n> There is always faith in a miracle. Either it will be a bloody meat grinder and corpses, or it will be a professional counterattack. There are two options. In any case, there will be a counteroffensive.\"\n\n> https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/?fbclid=IwAR2WkO0G5Ts6clc0GSR4hngQ-tW3vlO3g5Dval8inV0sCEYv9CFSCVZmzQA\n\n> All this is true. And all this is discussed in the army. This realism is necessary for the formation of an objective picture in Ukrainian and American society. We must realize the insufficiency of efforts to train and organize our troops.\n\n> Unfortunately, the reaction to these important words of a successful commander became unpleasant. \"Kupola\" is going to be removed from office.\n\n> For what? For the fact that the commander cares about the lives of the soldiers and requires changes in training in order to conduct a successful counteroffensive, because without changes in training, no words will break through the front? So this is the only possible way to win.\n\n> If the removal takes place, it means that the current army will lose a quality commander, the fighting capacity of the battalion and the brigade as a whole will be significantly reduced, a coherent team will be undermined, and instead of honest analysis and real changes, analysis of mistakes, the Russians will win in the army, where any fair comments are denied, and those who do them are oppressed, thereby making the necessary changes impossible.\n\n> I hope that the leadership will consider the situation, and \"Kupol\" will be kept in office, recognized for his combat path with the appropriate awards, and his words will receive a fair evaluation. We must defeat Russia both on the front and in our minds - and instead of keeping our mouths shut, we must start thinking and acting in order to improve ourselves daily.",

So this is the only possible way to win.</p>\n\n<p>If the removal takes place, it means that the current army will lose a quality commander, the fighting capacity of the battalion and the brigade as a whole will be significantly reduced, a coherent team will be undermined, and instead of honest analysis and real changes, analysis of mistakes, the Russians will win in the army, where any fair comments are denied, and those who do them are oppressed, thereby making the necessary changes impossible.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that the leadership will consider the situation, and &quot;Kupol&quot; will be kept in office, recognized for his combat path with the appropriate awards, and his words will receive a fair evaluation. We must defeat Russia both on the front and in our minds - and instead of keeping our mouths shut, we must start thinking and acting in order to improve ourselves daily.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Russia was considered perhaps the second or third most capable military, and they have made no significant gains in almost 9 months, while losing thousands of vehicles and tens of thousands of troops, all with virtually no casualties from those Western nations.

Or, at least, failure to have successes would certainly increase that opposition. And, again, in Europe as well as the US.\n\n>It won't change the raw calculus that the US and the West benefit from Russia being bogged down in a war\n\nNo. Thats true. But over that timescale they're going to need to see *more* than Russia being bogged down. All the stuff that could be given *with no effect on US/EU defence* has already been given. The Cold War surplus stores are now empty. Countries aren't going to continue to give *out of equipment that is active or semi-active* just for bogging Russia down.\n\nSure, they will give their surplus/stored equipment  to have that effect..... but no-one will want to give more than that for a stalemate.\n\n>why would the same people who seemed to plan on arming a Ukrainian insurgency, be opposed to arming a functional independent Ukraine?\n\nBecause to arm an insurgency they could empty out loads of stuff they had in excess/storage..... mostly man portable stuff too.\n\nIts different giving Javeliens, Stingers, mines and small arms from surplus stores..... to reaching into active fleets to give MBTs, IFVs, aircraft, SPGs and Anti-Air.... and the ammunition they require, which is now running low.\n\n>If anything, the more successful Ukraine is, the less eager the West will be to help push Putin into a corner.\n\nAgain, I don't think so. Or at least I don't think so as long as the war stays within Ukranian borders.\n\n>If the offensive fails, Russia won't be any more inclined to negotiate than they are now \n\nAbsolutely. I agree. If the offensive fails Russia will continue to push for the maximum it can get. As I said, thats likely to be current territory + the rest of Donetsk Oblast. Maaaaybe the rest of Zaporhizia Oblast. They will have no incentive to stop the war until they at least reach those minimal objectives, which Putin can sell as a win.\n\nIf the action is all \"Russia can continue to slowly take land up to the Dnipro\" and \"Ukraine can't take land back\"..... then Russia has no incentive for a ceasefire until they've reached the minimum Putin can sell as a win.\n\n>it doesn't make sense that the West would cut aid while Ukraine was pushed back and their independence was once more threatened.\n\nWhy wouldn't it ? They've already had everything we could spare without cutting into our own defence (and had a little bit of that). *In a year*.\n\nIf Ukraine can't take land back why would they spend the next year cutting into their active fleets ? And the year after that absolutely gutting all NATO militaries to keep the equipment flowing ?..... if all that UA are getting in return is slowing the russian advance ? \n\nThere is no \"all of the 2022/early 2023 equipment to be supplied again next year\" just sitting around. The T-72s are all gone. The L1s are all gone. The L2s and Challengers that could be spared are all gone. The BMPs are all gone. They're going to need to see an incipient/likely UA win to be incentivised to provide more.\n\n>Especially when the most impactful aid to Ukraine would be artillery munitions, munitions whose numbers should ramp up over time and be easier for the West to supply.\n\nWell, I don't doubt that they'll happily provide further shells. Its more the \"absolutely everything else we can spare\" that we're running out of. \n\nEven on the shell front. They're using 90k a month by latest reports, and will need 180k a month to conduct offensives..... and our production is somewhere around 30-50k a month, being ramped up to 90k a month. I think they'll happilly supply what we can produce whatever the results ammo wise..... but the large \"spare stocks\" are already drawn down a fair bit, and they won't want to draw down further unless they see its having results. \n\nIn any case we don't have any more easily spared 155 tubes to send. Ukraine is losing them, and (again) absent a willingness to denude the NATO militaries of active tubes, they won't be getting many more. NATO is going to want to see successes to go further in replacing 155mm tube losses.\n\nWhat do you think Ukraine is going to fire the shells out of ?\n\n>The only way this summer is decisive, is politically and that's just impossible to guess. Would a successful Ukrainian offensive push Putin to the negotiating table instead of a second mobilization?\n\nNo, I don't think so. I don't think we've got a situation here where russia will ever negotiate a loss. Putin wouldn't survive. I think we've got to consider a situation where the *russian army collapses* a la the 1917 French or Russian Mutinies as a neccessary precondition for any UA \"win\".\n\nTo do that UA has to be successful in their offensives.\n\n>Will Biden and others decide that Ukraine is a liability and cut funding, no matter what is happening in the war?\n\nNot if they're winning!....... But maybe, if they're losing... and a decision is made \"we can't pour active equipment into this endless sinkhole, and all the surplus and easy to spare stuff ran out in Nov 2022\".",

They will have no incentive to stop the war until they at least reach those minimal objectives, which Putin can sell as a win.</p>\n\n<p>If the action is all &quot;Russia can continue to slowly take land up to the Dnipro&quot; and &quot;Ukraine can&#39;t take land back&quot;..... then Russia has no incentive for a ceasefire until they&#39;ve reached the minimum Putin can sell as a win.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>it doesn&#39;t make sense that the West would cut aid while Ukraine was pushed back and their independence was once more threatened.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why wouldn&#39;t it ? They&#39;ve already had everything we could spare without cutting into our own defence (and had a little bit of that). <em>In a year</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If Ukraine can&#39;t take land back why would they spend the next year cutting into their active fleets ? And the year after that absolutely gutting all NATO militaries to keep the equipment flowing ?..... if all that UA are getting in return is slowing the russian advance ? </p>\n\n<p>There is no &quot;all of the 2022/early 2023 equipment to be supplied again next year&quot; just sitting around. The T-72s are all gone. The L1s are all gone. The L2s and Challengers that could be spared are all gone. The BMPs are all gone. They&#39;re going to need to see an incipient/likely UA win to be incentivised to provide more.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Especially when the most impactful aid to Ukraine would be artillery munitions, munitions whose numbers should ramp up over time and be easier for the West to supply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, I don&#39;t doubt that they&#39;ll happily provide further shells. Its more the &quot;absolutely everything else we can spare&quot; that we&#39;re running out of. </p>\n\n<p>Even on the shell front. They&#39;re using 90k a month by latest reports, and will need 180k a month to conduct offensives..... and our production is somewhere around 30-50k a month, being ramped up to 90k a month. I think they&#39;ll happilly supply what we can produce whatever the results ammo wise..... but the large &quot;spare stocks&quot; are already drawn down a fair bit, and they won&#39;t want to draw down further unless they see its having results. </p>\n\n<p>In any case we don&#39;t have any more easily spared 155 tubes to send. Ukraine is losing them, and (again) absent a willingness to denude the NATO militaries of active tubes, they won&#39;t be getting many more. NATO is going to want to see successes to go further in replacing 155mm tube losses.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think Ukraine is going to fire the shells out of ?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only way this summer is decisive, is politically and that&#39;s just impossible to guess. Would a successful Ukrainian offensive push Putin to the negotiating table instead of a second mobilization?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve got a situation here where russia will ever negotiate a loss. Putin wouldn&#39;t survive. I think we&#39;ve got to consider a situation where the <em>russian army collapses</em> a la the 1917 French or Russian Mutinies as a neccessary precondition for any UA &quot;win&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>To do that UA has to be successful in their offensives.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Will Biden and others decide that Ukraine is a liability and cut funding, no matter what is happening in the war?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not if they&#39;re winning!....... But maybe, if they&#39;re losing... and a decision is made &quot;we can&#39;t pour active equipment into this endless sinkhole, and all the surplus and easy to spare stuff ran out in Nov 2022&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

Unfortunately, that assumes the strategy is good. \n\nThe Ukrainians are doing the same thing in Bakhmut now that they did in Severodonetsk over the spring-summer, they're doubling down in a disadvantageous tactical location to make a political stand to the detriment of other locations. Had they retreated from Severodonetsk early and fell back across the Donets River and established defensive positions on the western high ground, their flanks would have been totally secure, fighting from two major terrain features, and their line much shorter, requiring far less units to defend it.

These types of large scale joint exercises are part dog and pony photo op opportunity, and part bonding experience between forces to better understand each other, especially allowing senior officers to bond with their peers from other militaries. \n\nIt's a mix of live fire exercises (shooting targets, often while moving) and some force on force, where units fight each other doing force on force but typically not a dedicated OPFOR. No MILES gear so no way to grade kills, they're just going through the motions. It's not actually about training, but putting everything together from planning, transportation, logistics, maneuver. The actual combat part is usually pretty tame compared to normal training, but it's not meant to test the squads and platoons, but everything higher than them. \n\n> I read that Russian exercises were little more than rehearsed theater where nothing was really learned\n\nRussia wasn't doing any legit force on force training. Basic stuff with blanks but nothing that could be considered valid where they know they're getting hit, and forced to use good tactics. Most of their training was very scripted live fire exercises, shooting at targets that didn't move, don't think, don't improvise, etc.\n\nIt's like McDojo or Kung Fu Karate doing kata, shadow boxing, bag or pad work but only extremely slow paced partner exercises where they don't resist much if at all. Then compare that to BJJ, Muy Thai, or just boxing, who regularly spare at half or full intensity. The latter fight constantly, so getting into a real fight isn't that different. The former dont actually fight until they get into a real fight, and often fall apart because it's so different from how they trained.\n\nNo training can fully replicate combat but good training comes close enough to give a major edge. Bad training can be worse than no training, as it can actually teach the wrong skills while giving misplaced confidence that they know what they're doing.\n\n[This is what bad training produces](https://youtu.be/HXETLzscI00)",

As stated in the article, it's a way of making a living for criminals who otherwise have no alternative.\n\nHowever, I can't help but feel like something else is at play; this is basically a promotion, and financial benefits are not the only reason people take promotions. These are the people who survived six months in an environment with very low odds of survival, and are now moving up the hierarchy. It's really not that big of a leap to see it as hazing, after which they've earned their place in Wagner.\n\nAlso, perhaps this comparison is somewhat clich\u00e9, but such loyalty of Wagner to their commander is giving me \"Marian reform\" Roman army vibes. As the generals were responsible for the livelihoods of their soldiers, these soldiers became very loyal to their generals, which was one of the reaons for the many roman civil wars in the 1st century BC.

As stated in the article, it&#39;s a way of making a living for criminals who otherwise have no alternative.</p>\n\n<p>However, I can&#39;t help but feel like something else is at play; this is basically a promotion, and financial benefits are not the only reason people take promotions. These are the people who survived six months in an environment with very low odds of survival, and are now moving up the hierarchy. It&#39;s really not that big of a leap to see it as hazing, after which they&#39;ve earned their place in Wagner.</p>\n\n<p>Also, perhaps this comparison is somewhat clich\u00e9, but such loyalty of Wagner to their commander is giving me &quot;Marian reform&quot; Roman army vibes. As the generals were responsible for the livelihoods of their soldiers, these soldiers became very loyal to their generals, which was one of the reaons for the many roman civil wars in the 1st century BC. I really can&#39;t shake the impression that such a dynamic is continuing to grow in scale with Wagner and Prigozhin, despite increasing attempts by the Kremlin to kneecap Wagner.</p>\n</div>",

I like to divide it into 4 tiers:\n\n**1 Towed howitzer** - eg M777, D-30. Because these need to be limbered and unlimbered they are very slow to move after firing and very vulnerable to counterbattery fire as well as getting spotted by drone and have a Lancet called on them these days. Has the advantage of being much cheaper than truck or self propelled howitzers. M777 is super lightweight and can be moved around by heavy helicopter, but even so towed guns have trouble keeping up with mechanized units during maneuver warfare.\n\n**2 \"Walking\" howitzer** - rare tier, only example that comes to mind is Haubits FH77. Nearly identical to towed howitzer and require a truck to move it long distance, but this uniquely has a small car engine integrated into the carriage which allows the carriage to be moved around at walking speed under its own power. This allows it to move to some degree after firing to avoid counterbattery fire.\n\n**3 Truck howitzer** - eg Caesar, PCL-181, Archer. Self propelled howitzer integrated into a truck chassis, these guns generally still need to deploy to fire with accuracy but are hydraulic powered and can deploy and undeploy much quicker than towed howitzer. Often have levels of automation for loading process (rammer, single loading arm for round, twin loading arm for round and charge, fully automated magazine and autoloader etc). Truck base allows them to have very good operational mobility in places where there's good road network.\n\nTruck howitzers due to using truck base is generally much cheaper than the next tier of spg that require tracked base, Archer is unique here because it has extremely high level of automation compared to the rest that allow much higher RoF, but it pays for this by being as expensive as next tier despite being truck based.\n\n**4 Self-propelled howitzer** - eg PzH2000, M109, 2S19 Msta. Uses heavy duty tracked chassis which means no need to deploy any stabilizer before firing. Generally protected by all round light armour which makes them much more survivable from shell fragments from near hits. Usually have autoloader. Tracked base allows it to have much better cross country ability than wheeled base. On the other hand as with other tracked vehicles they are a maintenance hog.
