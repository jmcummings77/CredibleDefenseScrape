Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Part 1/2:\n>\n> - These 8 years of war hardened us and taught us how to fight. The Russians did not expect this from us.\n>\n>- The strategic goal of the Russian Federation is to destroy the Ukrainian statehood, as such. Russians deliberately travel from the Russian Federation to Ukraine in order to absolutely deliberately kill Ukrainians, namely to kill.\n>\n>- The essence of this war is that if we do not destroy the enemy now, we will be destroyed.\n>\n>- Russia is a country where military science is developed at a fairly high level. And she planned this invasion comprehensively, carefully and thoughtfully. Even the groupings of troops that were preparing for the \"operation\" changed several times.\n>\n>- We analyzed all possible options, how to act when it is a superior enemy, and when the offensive will be simultaneously from almost all directions, and it will be powerful and swift enough.\n>\n>- Before the onset of the Russian Federation, our military units and brigades could move from Transcarpathia to the Kyiv region, from Kyiv to the Kherson region, and, in the end, end up in the Odessa region. We conducted a large-scale complex of exercises, and more than one, which allowed us to completely change the configuration of our air defense, and, as a result, preserve its potential.\n>\n>- When it all started, I called every commander who was responsible for a particular area, and talked to him.\n>\n>- No need to be superficial about the activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. After all, they have caused us significant damage and continue to do so, and our people are dying every day.\n>\n>- We had the only viable option that could work in this situation - to inflict maximum losses on the enemy in the shortest possible time, to bleed the enemy so that he refused to continue his actions on the greater territory of Ukraine. And it worked.\n>\n>- We were forced, even at the expense of leaving part of the territory, to \"pull out\" the enemy, pull back his rear, his reserves, and simply burn him in those cities where the equipment stopped in order to wait for refueling.\n>\n>- We count every projectile, every mine and every human life. They act like a horde. This is true.\n>\n>- Such losses, which the Russian Federation bears on the battlefield, would stop any country from further actions. 15 thousand losses in Afghanistan actually brought the Soviet Union to its knees. Now the number of Russian casualties is much, much higher - and this does not stop them.\n>\n>- The fact that we are holding on so far is the merit of Ukrainian people, Ukrainian soldiers, sergeants, officers who die and are maimed every day, but hold their combat positions. And today they are making this victory. And this is the only phenomenon that allows us to fight so far - this is our Ukrainian people.\n>\n>- We lost a lot of our people: many soldiers, sergeants, professional military leaders - those who had skills and experience. All the victories that we had - they were all won at the cost of human lives. But this is a war, and we will definitely win.\n>\n>- The sinking of the cruiser Moskva is, of course, of strategic importance to us. But we will definitely get to Grigorovich, and to Admiral Essen, and other ships.\n>\n>- These massive columns that were moving towards the Kyiv region - they had no fear of resistance, they could not even imagine that the \"second army of the world\" could be defeated.\n>\n>- Regarding Serpent's Island: the Russians made a huge mistake when they brought people, artillery and rockets there, and thought that they would organize a military garrison there and that it would exist there.\n>\n>- We, without a doubt, will return the Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. We will return everything. And we know what needs to be done for this, and we are doing it.\n>\n>- It is impossible to forgive and do some kind of indulgence to the enemy, because those who cannot defend themselves suffer: suffering Ukrainian children are pushing them to do their best and kill the enemy.\n>\n>- What Russia is doing in Ukraine is genocide.\n>\n>- I could not imagine that the Russians would turn our cities into a stone desert. Yes, I saw what was happening in Syria, I saw what happened to Chechnya, but I could not imagine that this would happen in Ukraine.\n>\n>- I tried to do the main thing - I tried to change the culture in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: so that each commander listens to the opinion of his subordinate, treats his subordinate as a person, so that normal relations are built between people in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n>\n>- I did not serve in the Soviet army, but the Soviet army lived in the Armed Forces of Ukraine for a very long time, and in some places has not yet completed its existence. If I find a representative of the Soviet army somewhere among us, I won't investigate for a long time.\n>\n>- There were cases when a sergeant who is on the front line called the commander in chief and said that it was necessary to deliver a fire strike at one point or another.\n>\n>My family has hardly seen me since 2014.\n>\n>- In Russia there is one military leader whom I read all the time. Now he does not publish anything fresh, but I am interested in his opinion, as a military man. This is General Gerasimov. He is cunning, he is unpredictable. This is a strong enemy that we, the military, must respect.\n>\n>- The Russian army had a good potential, and we must deprive them of this potential as soon as possible in order to destroy them as soon as possible.\n>\n>- The scale of this war is quite consistent with the First and Second World Wars. The front line for the Armed Forces of Ukraine is 3750 km and this is a lot. The amount of ammunition used by us and the enemy corresponds to those wars. I was sure that a war of this magnitude was impossible in the 21st century. And our Western colleagues did not believe that this was possible.\n>\n>- Our victory is, of course, the liberation of the entire occupied territory of Ukraine. And also - a powerful, ultra-modern, and perhaps huge, combat-ready Armed Forces that will not allow Russia to repeat what is happening now. And this must be implemented now, while we are still at war.\n>\n>- I would like to thank the Ukrainians. I am grateful that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are staffed with such people.

                    "body": "I think it's just much easier to get and spread information nowadays, unlike back then were people were certainly less likely to follow fighter/weapons development. There were still critiques coming out that were written reasonably but there were some that were outright doomposting.\n\nLike some examples:\n\nPeople questioned the [F-15 as it would never be a match against the MiG-25](https://twitter.com/scottmox/status/1381216578663034895/) (this was before it was found out that the latter wasn't actually a super fighter). People complained that **they're spending so much money** into the Eagle or that it was **already a write off**. America is doomed if the Eagle can't do Mach 3+ and if it can't pull high G maneuvers at such speed.\n \n[GAO questioned the USAF's decision [PDF]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/psad-78-36.pdf) to buy hundreds of F-16s, when it was still facing **engine problems and avionics issues**.

                                    "body": "> Secured to the extent of a single bridge supplying all of Crimea's needs.\n\nWell I agree that the large expense of supplying Crimea was probably a key motivator for the 2022 invasion. But that cost would take hundreds of years to add up to even the nominal cost of this war for Russia. And that's if it were to end in a negotiated peace in which Russia kept the land-bridge, which seems unlikely. Even in a frozen conflict the land bridge would not be a cost-effective way to supply Crimea because of the exponential cost of moving goods through a contested space.\n\n> Now they have a land bridge and can re-open the canal for water.\n\nNo, there's a reason the canal is still not running today. It was already quite dilapidated before 2014, losing more than half its water in transit, but now it's been damaged and probably is a loss. And the water source is right on the line of contact, so if they want to try to repair it (which would be a massive project), Ukraine can shell it whenever they want.\n\n> All the costs in men and material aren't things that Putin really cares about.\n\nThe fact that Putin doesn't care, which may be true, doesn't mean that they aren't damaging to him, and to Russia as whole. Its armed forces have incurred unfathomable losses to its most highly trained personnel. Training competent replacements would take a decade in the best of circumstances, but Russia has also lost most of the people capable of doing that kind of high-level training. So even if the war stopped today and every sanction was lifted, the RAF would take at least half a generation to replenish. \n\nThe mobiks who they throw to the meat grinder may be of less military value, but they're part of the labor force and demographically they're the most valuable part: Society has incurred the cost of raising and educating them but most of their productive years are ahead of them. But its not the dead mobiks, its emigration fleeing conscription which is the most costly. Even the most conservative estimates put the total population decline since Feb 2022 at over a million: largely of men in their 20s and 30s, with a disproportionate percentage of them being highly educated. For a country that already had profound demographic challenges, this represents a huge loss of economic potential. \n\nBut that's just the start: In 2022 Russia lost over $300 billion in currency reserves with a stroke of a pen, after painstakingly saving them up for over a decade. It's remaining currency reserves it is burning through at an unsustainable rate.\n\nRussia's main export is oil and they have been selling it at an astounding discount, fluctuating between 20 and 40 $/barrel discount, comparing Russia's Urals Crude to Brent Crude, the global benchmark. It's commonly joked that Russia only gets belligerent when the price of oil is high, but there's a good reason for it: Russia is one of the three biggest exporters of oil in the world, but its oil fields are comparatively expensive to run. So when the price is high Russia makes a ton of money, but when its not they don't make any. People make fun of sanctions, often with good reason, but the price-cap on Russian oil was a masterpiece, carefully designed to choke Russian revenue without impacting global oil production. For the foreseeable future Russia cannot count on oil revenues without serious concessions to the west.\n\nBut long term it gets worse for the Russian oil industry: Since the Soviet collapse, Russia has relied on western technology and know-how to maintain its oil wells. Many key components are only made in the west and cannot be import substituted (micro-chips are ubiquitous and highly interchangeable; oil-well components are unique and customized situationally.) Bringing new oil fields to market has relied on Western companies for exploration, installation and financing. So without rapprochement with the west, Russia's oil production capacity will decline. \n\nBut it's worse for Natural Gas, Russia's second biggest export. Russia made enemies of its biggest customers and Gas is not like oil, you can't just ship it anywhere. Replacing Europe as buyers for Russian Gas would require building new pipelines or new LNG production. Either of those would take a lot of time and enormous amounts of financing, which no one is currently offering Russia. Don't believe me? Where's the new pipeline to China they keep talking about? Over a year since their Gas exports started drying up, and the new pipeline looks no closer to starting construction.\n\nAnother critical Russian export was weapons, not just as a source of revenue, but of soft power. The sector was already declining before 2022, but appears in danger of collapsing altogether. In the short term Russia cannot make enough weapons to meet existing orders while replacing losses in Ukraine, but in the long term its worse: The global perception of its weapons platforms is cratering, as everyone sees how in real-world scenarios they fall short of their stated capabilities and are simply not a match for western weapons due to poor production quality.\n\nRussia's imports hurt too. They're good at import substitution, but this comes with a cost in lower quality components at a higher cost, which domestically drives inflation and internationally makes Russian products uncompetitive in the markets still available to them. \n\nI could keep going, but I think you get the point. This war's cost is incalculable to Russia's future, and it's only getting worse. \n\n> He wants to project an image of power and Russia has done enough for him to do that.\n\nThat's absurd. Before 2022 the common belief was that Russia was the second strongest military in the world. Now nobody believes that. Russia got pantsed on the biggest stage and showed everyone that it's military was all marketing. And that was pre-boondoggle, now, having expended all that material and personnel, Russia's combat potential is a fraction of even that low bar. For Putin, who seems to care so much about projecting power, this is a nightmare, worst-case scenario. \n\nRussia before 2022 was exerting outsized soft power for the actual size of its economy through energy exports that it has lost, arms exports which it is losing, and intimidation through muscular diplomacy that no one buys any more. The only tool it has which isn't in the process of collapse is propaganda, which loses power the farther your narratives stray from perceivable reality. Russia has no true allies of significance left; even China last week voted for a motion in the U.N. that called Russian aggression in Ukraine a threat to world order.\n\nAnd Putin is stuck in a cage of his own making. Domestically the war may seem to have popular support (depending on how much you believe polling in a totalitarian state), but losing a war is never popular. This was his decision, and as much as Russians can be manipulated into blaming generals or ministers to avoid saying they blame Putin, ultimately he owns the war, and thus he owns the cost it is incurring in Russian lives and economic hardship. Putin, like all strong-men cannot survive being seen as weak. He altered the Russian constitution to make four provinces of Ukraine an integral part of Russia, so anything less than the full conquest of those provinces would be a surrender. But they are nowhere near full control of those provinces and the winter offensive has made clear that the Russian Armed Forces have zero offensive potential left. Putin cannot hold out indefinitely, economic problems will continue to compound. Putin cannot surrender, as that would make him weak, and worse, it would make all the hardship he put the Russian people through for naught. And Putin cannot advance as his Army is spent, and every push just spends it further. He has no exit.\n\nWell you did it, you baited me into trying to list all the terrible costs to Russia from the idiotic blunder of 2022. Honestly, I really just scratched the surface.\n\nEdit: typo",

While being the attacker typically means you require three times the forces as the defender, and you take three times the casualties during an attack, being the attacker means you control the location and tempo. In a nutshell, only an attacker can win a war, because a defender cannot force an attacker to stop attacking, where a successful attack that captures the enemy's source of political power can end the conflict.\n\nTherefore, the Soviet Army post WW2 must be built for attack, with the defense being a transitional state before going over to the attack. The idea here is that the shorter the war was, the better it is in the long run; it's OK to assume a lot of casualties by being constantly on the offensive if you can decisively end the war in weeks or days vice months or years.\n\nThe second major lesson was related to the size of an army required to execute a successful attack, which can be broadly stated as \"How much combat power do I need per sq km of territory I must secure?\" Working out this formula meant that the Soviets could look at the distance between the East German border and the English Channel, count NATO noses, and compute exactly the size of army that would be required to capture this territory in one continuous attack.\n\nProblem: run that math, and the army size you compute is *huge* - far too large to sustain as a standing army.\n\nOK, then set up a system where every male enters service after finishing high school and is taught a military trade. Two years of training, then out into the workforce - but he can be mobilized for service and thrown into the breech whenever needed. Then you devise tactics (and optimize the weapons systems that support them) that are easy to learn, easy to execute, and easy to retain (such that a mobilized soldier who did his training a decade ago is still just as trained as someone who finished up last week).\n\nYou get rid of anything difficult - like logistics. Instead, you load up each unit with its allocated load of supplies, and you attack in echelons: first echelon pushes forward until it can no longer advance; it goes firm, and the second echelon takes over - repeat until English Channel, with the army sized with just enough echelons such that the final echelon reaches the final objective.\n\nEarlier echelons are not intended to be resupplied and put back in the fight as organic units; instead, you reconstitute new echelons by combining the remnants of the earlier echelons into new ones - and this happens well behind the line of battle because the advance is several echelons' worth of combat power down the trace.\n\nAnd finally, you build up enough equipment such that you have enough to execute this plan - meaning that every man called up for service has a personal weapon, uniform, and combat vehicle (tank or BMP) ready for him to use. This requirement means that the equipment be cheap and reliable, because you need to stockpile a lot of it and it may be sitting in depot for a long time.\n\nNow, if you are a tin-pot dictator looking to buy arms, this scheme of manouvre is very attractive: Soviet arms are cheap, reliable, and dont need much training to learn to use. Furthermore, they come with Soviet advisors and instructors who teach their system, and this system requires relatively few true professional soldiers (the formation leaders) who need expensive training (and who, once they are skilled enough, might start thinking about overthrowing you). So while this system was extensively tuned for the conquest of Europe, a lot of its attributes made for a great sales pitch.\n\nAnd this was helped by the fact that NATO was genuinely afraid of the Soviet conventional war machine, and they *were right to be so*, because *if it were executed properly* all the thought that had gone into building this army was completely legit. The Soviet Army circa 1980 could very well have achieved its objectives had it been unleashed (although the existence of tactical nukes is a factor - NATO relied on those for a long time as the bailout option).\n\nBut as good as this system is on paper, it relies on a couple of things:  those conscripts must have been properly trained, the equipment they are to fall in on once mobilized must be kept in good condition and must be sufficiently capable to give the latest Western equipment a good fight, and (most importantly) the full army must be mobilized, equipped, and sent into battle in the big continuous push that it was designed for; it is categorically not capable of doing Western-style distributed ops at smaller scales, because it doesn't have the integrated logistics.\n\nUkraine *should* have been an ideal place to do a \"proper\" Soviet attack. The whole invasion *should* have taken less than 24 hours had the Russians followed their own playbook. Instead, they either could not or would not commit to that level of effort, and attempted something at a reduced scale - which an army designed the way their built theirs is incapable of executing.\n\nThe lesson to all potential buyers is clear: unless you are willing to go all-in, and unless you are willing to build your army to the size that the numbers require such that going all-in will actually work against the enemy you face, the Soviet/Russian equipment/tactics package will be beaten by Western weapons and Western tactics.\n\nThis was first made apparent after Gulf War 1, when the Americans and British ROFLstomped the Iraqi Army, but the question was always open about how well the Iraqis executed (for example, they were defensive with an army designed for attack).But now that the Russians can't win an offensive war using their own weapons and tactics? Who is going to buy into that? Especially when Javelin and HIMARS are up for sale?",

The idea here is that the shorter the war was, the better it is in the long run; it&#39;s OK to assume a lot of casualties by being constantly on the offensive if you can decisively end the war in weeks or days vice months or years.</p>\n\n<p>The second major lesson was related to the size of an army required to execute a successful attack, which can be broadly stated as &quot;How much combat power do I need per sq km of territory I must secure?&quot; Working out this formula meant that the Soviets could look at the distance between the East German border and the English Channel, count NATO noses, and compute exactly the size of army that would be required to capture this territory in one continuous attack.</p>\n\n<p>Problem: run that math, and the army size you compute is <em>huge</em> - far too large to sustain as a standing army.</p>\n\n<p>OK, then set up a system where every male enters service after finishing high school and is taught a military trade. Two years of training, then out into the workforce - but he can be mobilized for service and thrown into the breech whenever needed. Then you devise tactics (and optimize the weapons systems that support them) that are easy to learn, easy to execute, and easy to retain (such that a mobilized soldier who did his training a decade ago is still just as trained as someone who finished up last week).</p>\n\n<p>You get rid of anything difficult - like logistics. Instead, you load up each unit with its allocated load of supplies, and you attack in echelons: first echelon pushes forward until it can no longer advance; it goes firm, and the second echelon takes over - repeat until English Channel, with the army sized with just enough echelons such that the final echelon reaches the final objective.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier echelons are not intended to be resupplied and put back in the fight as organic units; instead, you reconstitute new echelons by combining the remnants of the earlier echelons into new ones - and this happens well behind the line of battle because the advance is several echelons&#39; worth of combat power down the trace.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, you build up enough equipment such that you have enough to execute this plan - meaning that every man called up for service has a personal weapon, uniform, and combat vehicle (tank or BMP) ready for him to use. This requirement means that the equipment be cheap and reliable, because you need to stockpile a lot of it and it may be sitting in depot for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you are a tin-pot dictator looking to buy arms, this scheme of manouvre is very attractive: Soviet arms are cheap, reliable, and dont need much training to learn to use. Furthermore, they come with Soviet advisors and instructors who teach their system, and this system requires relatively few true professional soldiers (the formation leaders) who need expensive training (and who, once they are skilled enough, might start thinking about overthrowing you). So while this system was extensively tuned for the conquest of Europe, a lot of its attributes made for a great sales pitch.</p>\n\n<p>And this was helped by the fact that NATO was genuinely afraid of the Soviet conventional war machine, and they <em>were right to be so</em>, because <em>if it were executed properly</em> all the thought that had gone into building this army was completely legit. The Soviet Army circa 1980 could very well have achieved its objectives had it been unleashed (although the existence of tactical nukes is a factor - NATO relied on those for a long time as the bailout option).</p>\n\n<p>But as good as this system is on paper, it relies on a couple of things:  those conscripts must have been properly trained, the equipment they are to fall in on once mobilized must be kept in good condition and must be sufficiently capable to give the latest Western equipment a good fight, and (most importantly) the full army must be mobilized, equipped, and sent into battle in the big continuous push that it was designed for; it is categorically not capable of doing Western-style distributed ops at smaller scales, because it doesn&#39;t have the integrated logistics.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine <em>should</em> have been an ideal place to do a &quot;proper&quot; Soviet attack. The whole invasion <em>should</em> have taken less than 24 hours had the Russians followed their own playbook. Instead, they either could not or would not commit to that level of effort, and attempted something at a reduced scale - which an army designed the way their built theirs is incapable of executing.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson to all potential buyers is clear: unless you are willing to go all-in, and unless you are willing to build your army to the size that the numbers require such that going all-in will actually work against the enemy you face, the Soviet/Russian equipment/tactics package will be beaten by Western weapons and Western tactics.</p>\n\n<p>This was first made apparent after Gulf War 1, when the Americans and British ROFLstomped the Iraqi Army, but the question was always open about how well the Iraqis executed (for example, they were defensive with an army designed for attack).But now that the Russians can&#39;t win an offensive war using their own weapons and tactics? Who is going to buy into that? Especially when Javelin and HIMARS are up for sale?</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "Well, every one of them had some valid points when they were launched:\n\n- Germany Vs USSR was a given. It was just a matter of when. Germany just finished kicking France's rear and corner the British. They were running low on some resources needed for the war machine, in particular oil. The USSR had a terrible performance in Finland (+ the Germans surely remember that a few decades back the russians also had an abysmal performance agains the German army in WWI) and was still recovering from the Stalinist purges (many middle and high officials were killed due to not being aligned with the new management) and their industry was starting to grow. So it was a situation of Now or Never. \n\nJapan was, at leas in my opinion, a high stakes bet with a veeeery small chance of success. Their plan was to sink the US Pacific fleet. Fortify and make it so difficult to take it back that maybe they reach an agreement (hey, I give back all these islands, but I get to keep Korean and the parts of Chine I just took). \n\nVietnam: if the US helped Ho Chi Min when he was looking for help against France, they would have been the liberators against the colonial power and the American bastion in SEA.

It was just a matter of when. Germany just finished kicking France&#39;s rear and corner the British. They were running low on some resources needed for the war machine, in particular oil. The USSR had a terrible performance in Finland (+ the Germans surely remember that a few decades back the russians also had an abysmal performance agains the German army in WWI) and was still recovering from the Stalinist purges (many middle and high officials were killed due to not being aligned with the new management) and their industry was starting to grow. So it was a situation of Now or Never. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Japan was, at leas in my opinion, a high stakes bet with a veeeery small chance of success. Their plan was to sink the US Pacific fleet. Fortify and make it so difficult to take it back that maybe they reach an agreement (hey, I give back all these islands, but I get to keep Korean and the parts of Chine I just took). </p>\n\n<p>Vietnam: if the US helped Ho Chi Min when he was looking for help against France, they would have been the liberators against the colonial power and the American bastion in SEA.

In my opinion, this is a result of the rising yellow peril hysteria gripping the nation lately, but even if you disagree on the reasons, the program does not have a great track record and has certainly created alienation. It remains to be seen how this will effect the reputation of the United States as a destination for foreign-born researchers in the future.\n\n\n\nI don't know if anything similar is happening in the UK though, to be fair, so we can only speculate about this particular situation. I can say that if I were a Chinese American, especially one with dual-citizenship, I might not hesitate to take a more lucrative offer in China if my other home was actively persecuting colleagues of mine from my racial group.

In my opinion, this is a result of the rising yellow peril hysteria gripping the nation lately, but even if you disagree on the reasons, the program does not have a great track record and has certainly created alienation.

I can say that if I were a Chinese American, especially one with dual-citizenship, I might not hesitate to take a more lucrative offer in China if my other home was actively persecuting colleagues of mine from my racial group.

The Wall Street Journal leans right, anyway, so I'm really not sure what kind of point you're making. And I'm a rube for not buying anecdotes from a dude on reddit? I'm well aware that droves of people are applying to attend US universities, I live in Vietnam and have a business doing IELTS prep for said applicants. This thread and the articles linked refer to top-level researchers *employed* by American universities being harassed and driven off. \n\n\nThe rest of your butthurt rambling honestly doesn't make sense, but I gather you didn't much appreciate your hysterics being pointed out. I didn't say anything about \"people's suffering\" or Quinoa, lmao, I correctly pointed out that you've consistently refused to engage with the actual fact of what's going on, with ample citations, because you're credulously regurgitating yellow peril nonsense and incapable of applying critical thinking skills even when spoonfed information from uncontroversial sources. \n\n\nIt has nothing to do with either of our relative \"virtue\", but it does have a lot to do with *your* ability to examine and assimilate new facts when presented with them. \n\n\nVaguely stating that \"of course there's a nugget of truth, that's how narratives are crafted\" is absolutely useless because you're talking to me, here in this thread, about those actual truths. You implied that this shouldn't be taken seriously, via your vague reference to communist scheming, and when proven wrong you shift the goalposts and start getting emotional. Even if the CCP does use that information to craft \"narratives\" *you're not talking to the CCP*. You just keep bringing them up because you refuse to engage with the actual topic at hand. Am I supposed to give a shit that talking about actual events might somehow be considered an incredibly roundabout form of aid to the CCP? \n\n\nYour problem is that you started off trying to be coy, and because you weren't plain with your language and argument from the beginning you've got to grasp at any half-assed lifeline you can to deflect from the fact that you were just factually *wrong*. From \"I'm sure that's what the CCP wants to put out\" to \"well yeah of course there's truth to it that's how it works\" is a funny trajectory, though. You still haven't clarified what you meant by the ethno state thing, by the way. I suppose you're not interested in keeping to an ordered and coherent discussion though, given the way you childishly lashed out here, so I won't be holding my breath for clarification.\n\n\nI don't know why you think me saying the guy could have just accepted a better job offer disproves the things I said to *you*, I said those things to you because your comment clearly implied that it was some looney conspiracy theory that Chinese researchers are harassed in the United States. Two things can be true at the same time, we don't know this specific guy's motivations, but we certainly can't rule out unfavorable conditions in the United States for the aforementioned reasons, either. \n\n\nI can't say I'm very impressed with a supposed academic who has this much trouble following the thread of discussion, and I hope none of my students wind up crossing paths with you in the future.\n\n\nYour final paragraph is literally incoherent on the level of basic writing skills, not even touching on the content. I'm not sure what you're referring to yourself \"railing against\", here, but you seem to have a problem stating things directly so this is probably part of a pattern for you.\n\n\nAnyway, clearly you've become upset. Either it was the yellow peril bit or some kind of allergic reaction to citations I don't know, but it may be best for your blood pressure if we let this go, plus it's a waste of my time if you're going to post another unhinged comment like this one without substance, rather than engage in a good faith discussion of the facts. Even if you strenuously objected to my assertions of anti-Chinese sentiment, there must have been a more intelligent defense you could have come up with than flailing about like this.",

The Wall Street Journal leans right, anyway, so I&#39;m really not sure what kind of point you&#39;re making. And I&#39;m a rube for not buying anecdotes from a dude on reddit? I&#39;m well aware that droves of people are applying to attend US universities, I live in Vietnam and have a business doing IELTS prep for said applicants. This thread and the articles linked refer to top-level researchers <em>employed</em> by American universities being harassed and driven off. </p>\n\n<p>The rest of your butthurt rambling honestly doesn&#39;t make sense, but I gather you didn&#39;t much appreciate your hysterics being pointed out. I didn&#39;t say anything about &quot;people&#39;s suffering&quot; or Quinoa, lmao, I correctly pointed out that you&#39;ve consistently refused to engage with the actual fact of what&#39;s going on, with ample citations, because you&#39;re credulously regurgitating yellow peril nonsense and incapable of applying critical thinking skills even when spoonfed information from uncontroversial sources. </p>\n\n<p>It has nothing to do with either of our relative &quot;virtue&quot;, but it does have a lot to do with <em>your</em> ability to examine and assimilate new facts when presented with them. </p>\n\n<p>Vaguely stating that &quot;of course there&#39;s a nugget of truth, that&#39;s how narratives are crafted&quot; is absolutely useless because you&#39;re talking to me, here in this thread, about those actual truths.

When looked into further they were assault brigades under ministry of internal affairs. There was a good breakdown in a previous mega thread showing how bad it was but generally some units outside of active army were rushed into the fight.\n\nOtherwise with the Army, the training wasn't enough at first. That was acknowledged when the US training mission pivoted to provided large unit training to try and address.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There was truth to it though, it was in the details around if the units were Ukrainian Military or Internal affairs mostly but also army or TDF for Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>There are wide discrepancies but when media reported Ukrainian troops complaining that they were sent in green to Bakhmut, they just labelled them Ukrainian military soldiers. When looked into further they were assault brigades under ministry of internal affairs. There was a good breakdown in a previous mega thread showing how bad it was but generally some units outside of active army were rushed into the fight.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise with the Army, the training wasn&#39;t enough at first. That was acknowledged when the US training mission pivoted to provided large unit training to try and address.

Country\u2019s governments and their people very much don\u2019t like being threatened with nuclear annihilation, even if it is just bluster. Russia threw caution out the window when they started levelling cities in a non-aligned, non-nuclear state. One single attack on a NATO country would spell the end of their ill fated foray into Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",
