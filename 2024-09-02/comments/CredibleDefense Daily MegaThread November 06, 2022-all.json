        "body": "Russian Telegram accounts are reporting that the Russian offensive in Pavlivka went horribly wrong. I'm not clear on what exactly happened\u2014I heard the Russians took the town, then the Ukrainians quickly took it back. But the defeat sounds like it was notably disastrous.\n\n@Sladkov_plus:\n\n>URGENT!!!\n\n>THE GRAVE SITUATION IN PAVLOVKA (DNR). The marines of our 155th brigade turned to the Governor of Primorye Oleg KOZHEMYAKO.\n\n>I am not quoting the letter. Its essence was sent to the Ministry of Defense of Russia. The original is in Primorye. It says: great losses, the inability to convey to the top leadership the information about our high useless losses in men and equipment. I have the figures, but beyond that is a matter for the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\n>The marines ask Oleg Kozhemyako to address the Defense Ministry and request they send a commission to urgently analyze the situation. There are three loud names in the letter\u2014I know, but I do not quote them. However, I publish the post itself, because the situation in Pavlovka has been talked about at the top for several days, and the blood keeps pouring in and out. \n\n@wargonzo:\n\n>Things are objectively bad in Pavlovka.\n\n>The first joy at the fact that the Donbass Special Forces of the OBTF and Kaskad went there was replaced by extremely depressing news about the situation of the 155th Brigade of the TOF. Khodakovsky is openly attacking those who planned the operation (no names yet). A colleague and our military \"father\" Sladkov reports on painful losses and the appeal of Marines from 155 Brigade to the leadership of the Defense Ministry. We are waiting for specifics and conclusions.\n\n@swodki:\n\n>We are very often trying to figure out what is wrong. We are those who justifiably, or not, consider ourselves to be in a relationship of adequacy.

The marines of our 155th brigade turned to the Governor of Primorye Oleg KOZHEMYAKO.</p>\n\n<p>I am not quoting the letter. Its essence was sent to the Ministry of Defense of Russia. The original is in Primorye. It says: great losses, the inability to convey to the top leadership the information about our high useless losses in men and equipment. I have the figures, but beyond that is a matter for the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office.</p>\n\n<p>The marines ask Oleg Kozhemyako to address the Defense Ministry and request they send a commission to urgently analyze the situation. There are three loud names in the letter\u2014I know, but I do not quote them. However, I publish the post itself, because the situation in Pavlovka has been talked about at the top for several days, and the blood keeps pouring in and out. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>@wargonzo:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Things are objectively bad in Pavlovka.</p>\n\n<p>The first joy at the fact that the Donbass Special Forces of the OBTF and Kaskad went there was replaced by extremely depressing news about the situation of the 155th Brigade of the TOF. Khodakovsky is openly attacking those who planned the operation (no names yet). A colleague and our military &quot;father&quot; Sladkov reports on painful losses and the appeal of Marines from 155 Brigade to the leadership of the Defense Ministry.

Until when will such mediocrities as Muradov and Akhmedov plan the military actions for the sake of their reports and awards at the cost of so many people&#39;s lives. They do not care about anything just to show off. They call people meat. \nWe ask to appeal to the Supreme Commander, not to send a commission from the Defense Ministry, where Muradov is under Gerasimov&#39;s wing, but to send an independent one. Let them be asked about the purpose of such actions, their supply, and the results without any embellishments. \nHow much longer can this be tolerated!&quot;</p>\n\n<p><em>p.s.: when you can now understand that such messages are not tricks of the hohols, but the truth, in turn I will add that it is so everywhere, there are good commanders, but they are a minority, because they are eaten up by the system for the benefit of such f#ggots, as for Muradov (like Lapin), he was praised, defended, etc., when he behaved like a cuckold in Karabakh, when the Azerbaijani side shelled the Armenians and our peacekeeping contingent as much as they wanted</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                "body": "Thanks, missed that it was brought up yesterday. Though that comment selectively pasted parts of the article as well? Maybe in response to the OP. Here is the full:\n\n> KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 As they struggle to maintain an electricity grid heavily damaged by Russian missiles, officials in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, say they have begun planning for a once unthinkable possibility: a complete blackout that would require the evacuation of the city\u2019s approximately three million remaining residents.\n> \n> The situation is already so dire, with 40 percent of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed, that municipal workers are setting up 1,000 heating shelters that can double as bunkers while engineers try to fix bombed-out power stations without the needed equipment.\n> \n> To try to keep the grid from failing altogether, Ukraine\u2019s national energy utility said on Saturday that it would continue to impose rolling blackouts in seven regions.\n> \n> The tremendous strain on Ukraine\u2019s ability to provide power is the result of the widespread bombardment by Russian forces of critical energy infrastructure across the country, a tactic that analysts say President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has resorted to as his troops have suffered repeated setbacks on the battlefield.\n> \n> The damage caused by the Russian strikes has heaped new suffering on Ukraine\u2019s civilians and forced officials to reckon with the possibility that further damage could render them unable to provide basic services.\n> \n> \u201cWe understand that if Russia continues such attacks, we may lose our entire electricity system,\u201d Roman Tkachuk, the director of security for the Kyiv municipal government, said in an interview, speaking of the city.\n> \n> Officials in the capital have been told that they would be likely to have at least 12 hours\u2019 notice that the grid was on the verge of failure. If it reaches that point, Mr. Tkachuk said, \u201cwe will start informing people and requesting them to leave.\u201d\n> \n> For now at least, the situation is manageable, and there were no indications that large numbers of civilians were fleeing Kyiv, he said. But that would change quickly if the services that relied on city power stopped.\n> \n> \u201cIf there\u2019s no power, there will be no water and no sewage,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why currently the government and city administration are taking all possible measures to protect our power supply system.\u201d\n> \n> As winter approaches, the city is preparing 1,000 heating shelters that can also protect civilians from Russian missiles. Most are inside educational facilities, but the authorities have asked that their precise locations not be reported lest they become easy targets.\n> \n> In one school, the basement had been stocked with bottled water; makeshift classrooms had been set up; and a fire truck was stationed just outside the auditorium. Across the hall from a stack of disaster preparedness kits was a stark reminder of the normalcy the school once enjoyed: a large poster of Minnie Mouse.\n> \n> When Russia launched its latest barrage of more than 50 cruise missiles on Monday, most were shot down, Ukrainian officials said. But those that got through hit power plants and substations, immediately depriving thousands of people of power.\n> \n> On Friday, another Russian strike hit a facility run by the company that distributes power to people\u2019s homes. It was the 12th energy facility hit in the last month, the company said.\n> \n> Across the city, engineers were working to repair the damaged electricity infrastructure, despite having no easy way to obtain the hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment they would need to fully restore the network. To reduce the damage caused by future attacks, they were protecting power stations with blast walls.\n> \n> Ukraine\u2019s national electric utility, Ukrenergo, confirmed on Saturday the need to continue rolling blackouts, saying they were necessary to \u201creduce the load on the networks, ensure sustainable balancing of the power system and avoid repeated accidents after the power grids were damaged by Russian missile and drone attacks.\u201d\n> \n> The cuts would affect Kyiv and its environs, and the regions of Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr, the utility said.\n> \n> Ukraine\u2019s Western allies have stepped up their pledges to provide the country with more air defenses.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Thanks, missed that it was brought up yesterday. Though that comment selectively pasted parts of the article as well? Maybe in response to the OP. Here is the full:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 As they struggle to maintain an electricity grid heavily damaged by Russian missiles, officials in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, say they have begun planning for a once unthinkable possibility: a complete blackout that would require the evacuation of the city\u2019s approximately three million remaining residents.</p>\n\n<p>The situation is already so dire, with 40 percent of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed, that municipal workers are setting up 1,000 heating shelters that can double as bunkers while engineers try to fix bombed-out power stations without the needed equipment.</p>\n\n<p>To try to keep the grid from failing altogether, Ukraine\u2019s national energy utility said on Saturday that it would continue to impose rolling blackouts in seven regions.</p>\n\n<p>The tremendous strain on Ukraine\u2019s ability to provide power is the result of the widespread bombardment by Russian forces of critical energy infrastructure across the country, a tactic that analysts say President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has resorted to as his troops have suffered repeated setbacks on the battlefield.</p>\n\n<p>The damage caused by the Russian strikes has heaped new suffering on Ukraine\u2019s civilians and forced officials to reckon with the possibility that further damage could render them unable to provide basic services.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe understand that if Russia continues such attacks, we may lose our entire electricity system,\u201d Roman Tkachuk, the director of security for the Kyiv municipal government, said in an interview, speaking of the city.</p>\n\n<p>Officials in the capital have been told that they would be likely to have at least 12 hours\u2019 notice that the grid was on the verge of failure. If it reaches that point, Mr. Tkachuk said, \u201cwe will start informing people and requesting them to leave.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For now at least, the situation is manageable, and there were no indications that large numbers of civilians were fleeing Kyiv, he said. But that would change quickly if the services that relied on city power stopped.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no power, there will be no water and no sewage,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why currently the government and city administration are taking all possible measures to protect our power supply system.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As winter approaches, the city is preparing 1,000 heating shelters that can also protect civilians from Russian missiles. Most are inside educational facilities, but the authorities have asked that their precise locations not be reported lest they become easy targets.</p>\n\n<p>In one school, the basement had been stocked with bottled water; makeshift classrooms had been set up; and a fire truck was stationed just outside the auditorium. Across the hall from a stack of disaster preparedness kits was a stark reminder of the normalcy the school once enjoyed: a large poster of Minnie Mouse.</p>\n\n<p>When Russia launched its latest barrage of more than 50 cruise missiles on Monday, most were shot down, Ukrainian officials said. But those that got through hit power plants and substations, immediately depriving thousands of people of power.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, another Russian strike hit a facility run by the company that distributes power to people\u2019s homes. It was the 12th energy facility hit in the last month, the company said.</p>\n\n<p>Across the city, engineers were working to repair the damaged electricity infrastructure, despite having no easy way to obtain the hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment they would need to fully restore the network. To reduce the damage caused by future attacks, they were protecting power stations with blast walls.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s national electric utility, Ukrenergo, confirmed on Saturday the need to continue rolling blackouts, saying they were necessary to \u201creduce the load on the networks, ensure sustainable balancing of the power system and avoid repeated accidents after the power grids were damaged by Russian missile and drone attacks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The cuts would affect Kyiv and its environs, and the regions of Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr, the utility said.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s Western allies have stepped up their pledges to provide the country with more air defenses. But putting them in place has been challenging, and opposition to the aid effort is bubbling up in the West as many countries face their own economic headwinds.</p>\n\n<p>But U.S. and European leaders have so far remained unswayed.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, President Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said during a visit to Kyiv that Washington\u2019s support for Ukraine remained strong and that aid would continue to flow after the midterm elections.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m confident U.S. support for Ukraine will be unwavering and unflinching,\u201d Mr. Sullivan told reporters in a sandbagged conference room in the presidential office.</p>\n\n<p>Buttressing that pledge on Friday was an announcement by the Defense Department that it was setting up a new command to oversee how the United States and its allies train and equip the Ukrainian military.</p>\n\n<p>It also announced a new package of $400 million in security assistance, bringing to a total of $18.9 billion the military assistance that the United States has committed to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.</p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon\u2019s new commitments show that the United States expects the threat that Russia poses to Ukraine and its neighbors to persist for many years, current and former senior U.S. officials said.</p>\n\n<p>Also on Saturday, Iran\u2019s foreign minister acknowledged for the first time that his country had sent armed drones to Russia, although he said they had been delivered before Moscow invaded Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the war, but particularly in recent weeks, Russia has used Iranian-made drones to launch deadly strikes that have wreaked havoc on Ukrainian cities, according to Ukrainian and Western officials.</p>\n\n<p>Iran has denied sending drones to Russia for use in Ukraine, and the Kremlin has denied using Iranian drones to attack civilians.

That&#39;s why our men had to return,&quot; - one of the interlocutors of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, familiar with the May assault on Zmiine, said.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, the Russian Defense Ministry announced more than 50 dead Ukrainian paratroopers, destruction of several helicopters, &quot;Bayraktars&quot; and boats.</p>\n\n<p>In the circles of the Ukrainian military, the &quot;UP&quot; also heard different figures of losses, some even began to call Budanov a &quot;butcher&quot; who &quot;killed people to put a flag on the island by May 9&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>However, the interlocutors of the &quot;UP&quot; in the highest echelons of the intelligence assure that the Russian data is, to put it mildly, a lie.</p>\n\n<p>According to our sources, <strong>the losses of Ukraine during the operation amounted to about 10 people and one boat. In addition, all the helicopters that stormed the island, according to the &quot;UP&quot;, returned to their bases. And, according to the bitter irony of fate, the helicopter, which was for backup, and at the helm of which was the deputy commander of the Navy Igor Bedzay, was shot down by Russians over the territory of Odesa region</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
