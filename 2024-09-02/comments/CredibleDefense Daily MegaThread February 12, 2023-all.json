The UK MoD stated that they cannot verify the Ukrainian General Staff\u2019s methodology for counting Russian casualties.\n\nA Russian State Duma parliamentarian called for increased censorship legislation to protect Russian military figures from criticism.\n\nThe Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) released an intercepted call excerpt of Shahed drone operators in Ukraine speaking in Kurdish and Farsi and stated that Russian forces may be using Kurdish mercenaries to operate Iranian drones in Ukraine.\n\nRussian sources claimed that Russian forces are continuing offensive operations northwest of Svatove. Russian forces continued offensive operations around Kreminna with a reported 23 combat clashes in the area.\n\nRussian forces continued ground attacks around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Vuhledar.\n\nWagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that Wagner Group forces seized Krasna Hora north of Bakhmut.

        "body": "So I have recently read \"Military Power\" by Stephen Biddle, and I'm wondering how and in what way the war in Ukraine fits into the thesis of his book.\n\nFor those that don't know Biddle's central points are as follows:\n\n* The modern battlefield is enormously lethal, and has been that way since the late 19th century\n\n* This led to the stalemate observed in WWI, which was only broken in 1918 when a convergent evolution of military doctrine resulted in something he dubs the \"modern system of warfare\"\n\n* Tactically this system is focused primarily on limiting your force's exposure to enemy fire. For the attacker it means an emphasis on cover, concealment, dispersion, small-unit initiative, the use of suppression and combined-arms operations. On the operational level these tactics allow breakthrough and subsequent maneuver, where the aim is to reduce the enemy's combat power (by overrunning command posts, supply dumps and artillery positions) while fighting as small a fraction of the enemy force as possible.\n\n* The exact same tactical considerations apply to the defenders. On the operational level however the main focus rests on reducing the enemy's ability to break through. Defensive lines need to be deep, reserves must be formed and counterattacks against the enemy spearhead become key. The pivotal defensive operation is no longer the pitched defensive battle at the line of engagement but the delaying action and subsequent counterattack.\n\n* This system is hard to implement and many armies to this day only implement it partially. When an army that implements the system very well goes up against one that implements it poorly, the first one usually wins. This started with the German spring offensive of 1918, which broke the stalemate on the western front and continues to The second gulf war and beyond. the only change has been an ever increasing lethality of the battlefield, meaning that the gap in combat power between those armies that implement the modern system and those that don't increases further and further.\n\nSo in what way can this framework be applied to Ukraine? it is clear that both sides can only partially implement the modern system. While the Russians have been making an effort to build defensive lines that reduce their exposure to enemy fires, their assaults rarely achieve tactical surprise and their integration of combined arms appears poor, with captured orders indicating that artillery support is largely conducted \"by timetable\". And when it comes to small-unit initiative, this has never been a strong point of the Russian army, and probably hasn't gotten better, now that the pool of junior leaders has been heavily attrited.\n\nBut I wouldn't say that the Russians are completely ignorant here. They redesigned their supply system to cope with the GMLRS threat (dispersion!) and their tactical successes around Bakhmut were definitely not achieved by pushing columns of tanks down obvious avenues of advance.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>So I have recently read &quot;Military Power&quot; by Stephen Biddle, and I&#39;m wondering how and in what way the war in Ukraine fits into the thesis of his book.</p>\n\n<p>For those that don&#39;t know Biddle&#39;s central points are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The modern battlefield is enormously lethal, and has been that way since the late 19th century</p></li>\n<li><p>This led to the stalemate observed in WWI, which was only broken in 1918 when a convergent evolution of military doctrine resulted in something he dubs the &quot;modern system of warfare&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>Tactically this system is focused primarily on limiting your force&#39;s exposure to enemy fire. For the attacker it means an emphasis on cover, concealment, dispersion, small-unit initiative, the use of suppression and combined-arms operations. On the operational level these tactics allow breakthrough and subsequent maneuver, where the aim is to reduce the enemy&#39;s combat power (by overrunning command posts, supply dumps and artillery positions) while fighting as small a fraction of the enemy force as possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>The exact same tactical considerations apply to the defenders. On the operational level however the main focus rests on reducing the enemy&#39;s ability to break through. Defensive lines need to be deep, reserves must be formed and counterattacks against the enemy spearhead become key. The pivotal defensive operation is no longer the pitched defensive battle at the line of engagement but the delaying action and subsequent counterattack.</p></li>\n<li><p>This system is hard to implement and many armies to this day only implement it partially. When an army that implements the system very well goes up against one that implements it poorly, the first one usually wins. This started with the German spring offensive of 1918, which broke the stalemate on the western front and continues to The second gulf war and beyond. the only change has been an ever increasing lethality of the battlefield, meaning that the gap in combat power between those armies that implement the modern system and those that don&#39;t increases further and further.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So in what way can this framework be applied to Ukraine? it is clear that both sides can only partially implement the modern system. While the Russians have been making an effort to build defensive lines that reduce their exposure to enemy fires, their assaults rarely achieve tactical surprise and their integration of combined arms appears poor, with captured orders indicating that artillery support is largely conducted &quot;by timetable&quot;. And when it comes to small-unit initiative, this has never been a strong point of the Russian army, and probably hasn&#39;t gotten better, now that the pool of junior leaders has been heavily attrited.</p>\n\n<p>But I wouldn&#39;t say that the Russians are completely ignorant here. They redesigned their supply system to cope with the GMLRS threat (dispersion!) and their tactical successes around Bakhmut were definitely not achieved by pushing columns of tanks down obvious avenues of advance. I find it very likely that different parts of the Russian forces implement parts of Biddle&#39;s modern system to different degrees, which is why we see columns of burned tanks in Vuhledar but not in Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>On the Ukrainain side, it is clear that they aren&#39;t fighting a mobile defense. Every urban area is tenaciously defended until the position becomes logistically untenable.  They seem to do better when it comes to small-unit initiative and the Charkiv offensive in September was very impressive, albeit against an enemy that had no reserves whatsoever. Here too the force is probably very heterogeneous with elite units that can execute quite complex operations and TDF units that can do little more than stand in a trench and get shelled.</p>\n\n<p>So what do you guys think?

Why would China invade another nation's airspace with an airship when it has spy satellites at its disposal? How extensive is China's spy balloon program? Why were earlier over flights of U.S. territory by Chinese airships missed? And was the F-22 shoot-down of the balloon as easy as it looked on television?\n\n...\n\n> In the meantime, we learned a couple other things. First of all, that balloon that the Chinese floated across the U.S. is pretty impressive. We've been trying to do these sorts of things, these ultra-long endurance, high altitude balloons for a long time, both commercially and with the military, and some have been more successful than others. Loon was probably a good example of a mixed success story, but that project's been canceled for a couple years now.\n\n> But this balloon was different than all of the others that we've seen before in the sense that it still used what appeared to be that super pressure pumpkin-shaped envelope, helium envelope, that we've seen with other types of this kind of ultra- long endurance balloon. But it had, instead of having this translucent fabric in the envelope, it had an opaque envelope. And that's pretty important, because it means that they figured out a way to reflect the energy from the sun away from the balloon so that the solar energy didn't go into the helium inside the gas bag, increase the temperature of that helium, which increases the pressure, which then causes the balloon to explode. That's why all the previous balloons we've seen this have been translucent at those altitudes and for those durations to allow that solar energy to pass through the balloon and minimize the amount of heat that gets created within the helium structure itself.",

They have an ISS supply contract, certain other NASA launches, and some contracts with the USAF. Indeed, those are not trivial, but they don't grant anything beyond the scope of the contract.

The US military can't simply nab Starlink satellites either. And even if it produced its own receivers, that does not grant it rights to use them with Starlink satellites. It's similar to... I can buy my own cable modem, but unless I contract with my local cable internet provider for service, I can't simply connect my modem to their infrastructure and go to town.",

                        "body": "T-62Ms are a complicated issue. The Soviets kept the production line going well into the 80's and the late production T-62's went straight into reserve. Some of the reserve units reactivated for this war post-mobilization were built around the T62M as their primary tank. This matters particularly when it comes to staffing, as you need four man crews for the T-62 given that there's no autoloader.

The Soviets preferred to keep multiple production lines running for a variety of reasons, the biggest being internal politics (factories were constituencies).

This has been a fortunate end result for analysis folks, because you can use the MBT model to generally determine which units were where during the first 2-3 months (especially around Kyiv because the VDV generally lacks organic armor barring the tank bn the 76th VDV div brought with it). \n\nThe T-62 is a *colossal* red herring and nothing should be read into that.

They are probably some of the chasses that are in the best shape, given that they only saw reservist training duty over the past 40 years.

They are also giving T-62s to the Donbas militias, which makes sense. Honestly, given the choice between a T-72A or B (and the Russians had a surprisingly large number of those in the active units in February-March) which has thousands of miles and hard serve on it, or a T-62M with a pretty fresh engine and potentially better optics, I'd rather run the T-62M.",

Russia's t-72s dwarf the t-80s and t-90s by percentage of their total tank force. Especially for an inefficient and corrupt system like the Russian government (and by extension their military), it would be practically impossible to convert to only using t-80s and 90s (they certainly wouldn't give up their more advanced tanks for the sake of logistics).

Like the difference between an Abrams and an m60 is much more vast than between a t-72 and a t-90 in terms of parts, maintenance and logistics, as an example. </p>\n\n<p>But I think the real reason they&#39;re operating so many different types could be explained by the simple adage, &quot;you go in with the army you have, not the army you want&quot;. Russia&#39;s t-72s dwarf the t-80s and t-90s by percentage of their total tank force. Especially for an inefficient and corrupt system like the Russian government (and by extension their military), it would be practically impossible to convert to only using t-80s and 90s (they certainly wouldn&#39;t give up their more advanced tanks for the sake of logistics). Regardless, like the other poster said, it&#39;s a great sign they can&#39;t keep up with their losses. Slava Ukraini!</p>\n</div>",

The US represents ~25% of the world GDP and China represents ~18% of it. The US wants that order of ranking and relative positioning to stay the way it is. China wants the positions to be swapped. More specifically, observing China I get the feeling that they want to be in an economic position such that (a) they are fully independent, and (b) as much of the world is dependent on them as possible. The US, for the most part, just wants as much money as possible, which isn't compatible with being economically dependent on China.\n\nEverything else follows from that.\n\nChina, being the only power in the world that's even in the same ballpark as the US wants to be able to use their power. What good is having the world's second largest economy if it can be strangled by military action half a world away with no options for response or recourse? \n\nBut this isn't the 19th or early 20th centuries anymore. Colonialism is no longer acceptable. Or viable really, for that matter. China cannot go around the Pacific and establish 100 years of history with otherwise minor island nations to get them bases. Nor can China establish a century of military alignment with major regional powers that *want* China's military presence.\n\nThat leads to China being forceful and aggressive with its neighbors, trying to establish those relationships by (economic) force. Which brings us to the second set of opposing goals. The US *does* have those relationships with China's neighbors. The two most important of those neighbors, South Korea and Japan, have that relationship for reasons completely irrespective of China. At least historically. One of them, Taiwan, has that relationship solely because of China. Two others, Vietnam and the Philippines, are creating or re-establishing that relationship because of China. A bit farther out, Australia already had that relationship but it's being strengthened quite substantially because of China.\n\nChina's next most major neighbor is India who they also have quite a few contentions with... Really only Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea are non-issues for them. North Korea basically functioning as a client state, Russia going down that path, and Mongolia just... chilling.\n\nIf China was politically able to be patient (and to be fair here, the US wouldn't be able to be either), they'd have been far better served by spending decades establishing positive relationships with the whole region and just waiting out for their neighbors to grow tired of the US' then-unneeded presence or waited for the US to pull off another Iraq+Afghanistan fuckup that puts our geopolitical reputation (and resources) through a goddamn shredder.\n\nPersonally as an American I have a rather low view of a lot of actions from the Chinese government. In a way that would lead me to personally assign \"fault\" to them. Yet ultimately I think if they comported themselves differently such that I couldn't do that, the US-Chinese rivalry would still exist.\n\ntl;dr US and Chinese interests for the immediate area around China are in opposition, which is a result of US and Chinese long-term economic interests being in as stark opposition as can be.",

Sow 50 different narratives, and you'll find fertile ground in 50 different predispositional niches.\n\nThe more personally tailored and emotion driven our information spaces become, the more effective information shaping can be. For closely contested issues -- think certain national elections, brexit, or similar -- you may succeed in flipping the outcome with a small shift.  If the view is 51/49, a nudge is enough to attain 49/51. In less contested issues, you can create chaotic responses and sow nihilism and \"all sides equal\" disengagement.\n\nOpen societies with freedom of expression are critically essential for myriad reasons, but they have a structural weakness against weaponization of openness by external actors.
