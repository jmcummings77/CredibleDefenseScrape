      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Export revenue slightly rebounded from February lows, reaching $12.7 billion, but were still 43% down from a year earlier, the agency said.\n\n>Things could however become more complicated in the coming months as production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia drive oil prices higher. Moscow\u2019s flagship Urals grade in April came within about $5 of the $60-a-barrel cap, while the weighted average export price of all of the country\u2019s crude topped it, the IEA said.        \n\n>Western countries and their allies have adopted several waves of sanction to reduce Russia\u2019s oil-export proceeds, a key source of revenue for the national budget. The restrictions aim to limit the Kremlin\u2019s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. \n\n>The Group of Seven industrialized countries and their European Union allies have imposed ceilings on the price of Russian crude oil and refined products, which are designed to ensure the country\u2019s energy keeps flowing onto world markets while curbing revenue. The price restrictions came on top of EU bans on imports of nearly all seaborne Russian crude and petroleum products, depriving the Kremlin of what has historically been its largest energy market. \n\n>The bans forced Russia to find alternative markets in the Middle East, and Latin America and expand supplies in Asia, yet the G-7 price caps have given these new clients the leverage to negotiate discounts. The restrictions stipulate that buyers from third countries can only access western services such as insurance and shipping only if they comply with the caps.\n\n>>Export Prices Decline\n\n>Russian crude oil and petroleum products on average were sold well below the price limits last month, according to the IEA.\n\n>The weighted average export price of Russian crude was at $50.67 a barrel, compared with the cap of $60, the IEA calculated, using data from Argus Media Group and Kpler. That\u2019s also nearly $2 a barrel lower than the average price for February, the agency said.

Export revenue slightly rebounded from February lows, reaching $12.7 billion, but were still 43% down from a year earlier, the agency said.</p>\n\n<p>Things could however become more complicated in the coming months as production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia drive oil prices higher. Moscow\u2019s flagship Urals grade in April came within about $5 of the $60-a-barrel cap, while the weighted average export price of all of the country\u2019s crude topped it, the IEA said.        </p>\n\n<p>Western countries and their allies have adopted several waves of sanction to reduce Russia\u2019s oil-export proceeds, a key source of revenue for the national budget. The restrictions aim to limit the Kremlin\u2019s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>The Group of Seven industrialized countries and their European Union allies have imposed ceilings on the price of Russian crude oil and refined products, which are designed to ensure the country\u2019s energy keeps flowing onto world markets while curbing revenue. The price restrictions came on top of EU bans on imports of nearly all seaborne Russian crude and petroleum products, depriving the Kremlin of what has historically been its largest energy market. </p>\n\n<p>The bans forced Russia to find alternative markets in the Middle East, and Latin America and expand supplies in Asia, yet the G-7 price caps have given these new clients the leverage to negotiate discounts. The restrictions stipulate that buyers from third countries can only access western services such as insurance and shipping only if they comply with the caps.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Export Prices Decline</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russian crude oil and petroleum products on average were sold well below the price limits last month, according to the IEA.</p>\n\n<p>The weighted average export price of Russian crude was at $50.67 a barrel, compared with the cap of $60, the IEA calculated, using data from Argus Media Group and Kpler. That\u2019s also nearly $2 a barrel lower than the average price for February, the agency said. The weighted average is considered by western nations in their bi-monthly review of the price cap\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p>The IEA estimates are for the so-called free-on-board, or FOB, price, which excludes shipping and insurance costs.</p>\n\n<p>Urals FOB Baltic and Black Sea traded at an average $44.46 and $44 per barrel, respectively, the IEA said.

In 2019, 4 million went to Easter mass (the most important of the year): <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/29/russians-are-not-waiting-for-a-church-boom-a65792\">https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/29/russians-are-not-waiting-for-a-church-boom-a65792</a></p>\n</div>",

I'm sure this is party due to their range, but I'm also wondering if the act of going on the offensive requires these troops to leave EW cover, exposing them to these types of attacks in the first place. From what I understand jamming consumer/fpv drones is basically trivial with the right equipment in the right place. It makes sense to me there would be portions of the frontlines where these are practically not usable, but gaps exist OR troops expose themselves by going on the offensive.\n\nAs far as advanced, western loitering munitions go my understanding is these are much, much harder to jam, to the point where they can work in EW degraded environments. My guess is Ukraine really does not have the capacity to self-produce drones of this quality, I don't know much about the underlying tech but it would explain why so many of their domestic, jury-rigged drones seem to be mostly used against the frontline.\n\nIt does feel like in terms of economical usage there's a clear high-low mix in loitering munitions that makes a lot of sense given the EW Russian's capabilities. You have cheap FPV/quadcopter bomber type loitering munitions to strike close targets uncovered by EW, and longer range, EW-resistant platforms like SB600 to hit high value targets. I think those goes a long way to justifying the SB600s cost, because it does something most other drone platforms cannot do (lancet is probably in a similar class).\n\nAny thoughts?

Let me quote a [RUSI report](https://static.rusi.org/359-SR-Ukraine-Preliminary-Lessons-Feb-July-2022-web-final.pdf).

My response is:\n\n1. The ammunition shortage argument still stands. BTW, we've seen this play out in Libya.\n\n2. Everyone assumes that we would be able to just destroy the Russian air defenses. I don't think it's that obvious. It's not clear at all how well western militaries (especially those without F-35s) would fare in SEAD against an enemy with such dense air defenses. And even if it would be successful now, what if the air defense technology improves in the future? I don't think it's wise to bet everything on one horse.\n\n>Comparing their arms industries, it's not like Russia's production rates would let them rearm in 5 years and pose an actual threat \n\nThe military plans for much longer periods than just 5 years. It usually takes longer than 5 years just to fulfil the equipment orders placed today.\n\n> Poland alone could best Russia from what we now know. (Increasing shell capacity is justified, but force expansions etc.?)\n\nPoland will have a strong land army *in the future*, but they definitely don't have it now. Poland doesn't have modern air defences *at all*. The most capable system they had at the beginning of the war was S-200 (I think two batteries?). They have recently received a *single* Patriot battery, but I'm not sure if it's operational yet (there are a few more on order, though).\n\nThey currently have 200-300 tanks (mostly Leopard 2A4, 2A5 and PT-91s. T-72s are gone now), just 48 F-16s, BMP-1 is still the main tracked IFV. Artillery is a bad state. Most of Krabs were given to Ukraine (and it wasn't a lot to begin with) and they had to panic-buy K9s from South Korea.\n\nThe ammunition situation is unclear, but we know a lot was given to Ukraine. There was also a lot of talk before the war about the lack of 125mm ammunition for the T-72/PT-91.\n\nPoland's situation will drastically improve once they receive all the ordered equipment (Abrams and K2 tanks, Krabs, K9, Borsuk IFVs, HIMARS, K239 etc).

This would open an additional source of AA missiles.\n\n>Also, can the lack of AA blunt a future UA counteroffensive?\n\nEhh. Hard to say. Pushing Russia back reduces the number of systems that Russia can launch at distant targets like Kyiv, potentially shaking loose assets that would be tied down in the rear. On the other hand, letting Russia get air superiority of the front is equally bad.\n\nIt probably depends a lot on kind of missiles Ukraine runs low on first. Running out of missiles for static defenses means Ukraine would want to push Russia back reduce the pressure on those systems. Running out of short range missiles means that the front lines become vulnerable.\n\nAt least that is all my read on the situation.

About 90% of Ukraine's entire air defense network relies on the S-300, and these missiles are only built in Russia and China currently. Greece has some S-300 launchers and ammo, but not much anyone else besides India, who is not going to be giving Ukraine that ammo. Honestly, if the leak claims are true, then this is simply not going to be a solvable problem for the short-term. There are some solutions, but none of them are quick or cheap.\n\nThe West does not have that many ground-based NATO AA weapons to give Ukraine. We have the Patriot, and we have some shorter-range advanced systems like Iris-T and SAMP-T, but we don't have that many missiles for these systems, and we definitely don't have as many launchers as Ukraine has S-300 launchers. The best candidate for the Patriot to replace the S-300 is the PAC-3 missile, but there are apparently only 2,000 PAC-3 missiles worldwide, and about half of them are in active use, deployed in launcher tubes in Patriot batteries that are operating right now. This only gives us about half a year or less of ammunition for a fleet of Patriots that would replace the S-300 (and to date we've only been able to give 2 and a half Patriot batteries to Ukraine anyway, which is not enough to replace the coverage zones of 60+ S-300s they use now).\n\nThe Soviet Buk is the main short-range air defense system Ukraine and Russia use near the front line, and the Buk is also allegedly nearly depleted, with no good replacements. It can apparently be outfitted with some 1960's tech Cold War missiles from the West like the Sparrow, but these missiles will have reduced efficacy from the Buk's designed Soviet ammo, and we don't have enough to supplement Ukraine's front line anyway. We have been giving Ukraine more advanced, newer Western short-range and medium-range systems, like the Iris-T, but Ukraine has nearly completely exhausted all the Iris-T missiles ever produced (which are not many, because the system was only completed last year).\n\nSo, out of all these options, what else can we do? Well, frankly, the best option would be to give Ukraine a bunch of aircraft or ground-launchers that can shoot anti-missile missiles (AM-RAMS acronym type missile). These are small missiles that are typically launched from aircraft, not ground-launchers. Because of the West's air superiority doctrine, we have an absolute shitload of AMRAMs we can give Ukraine, but they are only useful if we give them airplanes or ground-based launchers that can actually fire that type of missile.\n\nThe American NASAM system is basically a mid-range AA launcher that actually uses the AMRAM missile in its launcher. However, we did not have any of these systems prior to the war, and it takes time to make them now. We've given Ukraine a handful of these batteries, and we'll continue making more of them for Ukraine, but we probably can't build enough in the next year to come even close to replacing the S-300 coverage needs.\n\nThat pretty much leaves NATO-standard aircraft, ideally Generation 3 and 4 aircraft like the F-16, Grippen, or Mirage. There aren't that many Grippens or Mirages that have ever been built, so this limits the logistics supply of spare parts, servicing experts, and training capacity. The F-16 has been built in the thousands. However, America has been quite sanguine about providing these frames to Ukraine. Even at the height of the F-16 hype, in early February, Biden's administration was only talking about giving two \"squadrons\" of F-16s -- that's 24 planes max. Not at lot, at all.\n\nMore importantly with airplanes, we can't give any of them to Ukraine quickly. Estimates are it'll take more than a year to roll out even a tiny quantity of F-16 or peer-quality Western planes for Ukraine's use. The training and servicing logistics simply takes too long to do this quickly. If the leaks are accurate, then the US has been ignoring this particular alarm bell for the last 6-9 months, and it could well have disastrous consequences for Ukraine. We should have been seriously training and preparing Ukraine for 100+ F-16s a year ago, not stumbling into this problem now. Now appears to be way too late.\n\nThe most interesting part about the leaks, to me, is that these documents were from mid-February. Right before this, Biden said that he was rejecting the F-16 idea entirely. I do wonder if dire assessments like this one and others that have come after it, will finally cause NATO to go into panic mode and get some planes into Ukraine. Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that they probably fucked up and failed to get the ball rolling on airplanes back in fall 2022 when Ukraine's AA statistics were showing signs of severe ammunition exhaustion. It is highly questionable now whether the West can get its shit together and get enough Ukrainian pilots and service crews trained and outfitted in time, which would apparently mean by this summer.\n\nIf you are reading all of this and concluding, \"Dang, that sounds bad...\" Well, in my non-professional opinion, I can't help but agree.",
