        "body": "Israel's Channel 12 has received leaked emails from the famous Unit 8200, composed mostly of 18-21 year olds, regarding warnings about Hamas attack plans before October 7. Article is in Hebrew so below is how google translated it. I don't think there's anything *too* substantial without knowing their context, for example how often intelligence like this comes around that amounts to nothing, but it's always interesting to get a peek into these organizations. FYI, Jerusalem Post characterizes the channel as \"the cheerleader-in-chief for the political opposition.\"  \n\nhttps://www.mako.co.il/news-military/6361323ddea5a810/Article-92d67e4f8f11c81026.htm\n\n---\n\n**Disclosure of \"Fact\": Details of the dramatic correspondence from Unit 8200: \"Death in the Kibbutz, at any cost\"**    \n*This email correspondence has been troubling Unit 8200 for the past few days - and rightly so \u2022 Tonight we revealed for the first time exactly what the veteran resistance fighter who predicted the Hamas attack wrote - and the reaction of the senior commander: \"a completely imaginary scenario*\n\nThis evening (Monday) we revealed for the first time the internal correspondence within Unit 8200, and the things written by the veteran resister from the unit - about the raid planned by Hamas deep in Israel. This, after Nir Debori revealed for the first time that her opponent had warned her direct commanders about the threat scenario .\n\nOn July 6 of this year, the esteemed counterintelligence officer who specializes in the Hamas arena, sent an email entitled \"Death in the Kibbutz, at any cost.\" In the same letter, she detailed that \"at the end of May, there was a crazy training session, of two companies in Nocha in the presence of a number of senior Hamas officials.\" The training It was, according to the same letter, \"long and exhausting, lasting from the morning until eight thirty in the evening\". The training included mounted forces, both on jeeps and on motorcycles. The terrorists practiced a scenario of shooting down an aircraft - both a fighter plane and a helicopter.\n\nAccording to the old permanent woman, the main exercise of the Hamas terrorists focused on taking over a kibbutz, which they gave it an invented name, and even practiced waving their flag over the synagogue and the kibbutz's secretariat. Another target marked by the terrorists: some military training base. \"An instruction was given to kill the entire crew,\" wrote the protester, adding a sting: \"The woman is always right.\" The protester signed off her email with a quote from an American philosopher: \"The art of reason is knowing what to ignore - and what not to.\"\n\nThe opposite party's colleagues did not ignore, and responded: \"Wow, this is crazy,\" wrote one of them. \"Amazing product\", \"golden intelligence\", responded one of the officers. \"Finally we are in the tactical plan of the Hamas preparations.\" Indeed, within three days, another opponent in the unit reported additional training, of additional battalions in Hamas, with each battalion training on its own target.\n\nAfter the report on the additional training of the murderous terrorist organization, the opposition sent another email: \"A cute little addition - during the training, the following conversation took place: 'How are you and what is your state of readiness, waiting for instructions from you so that we can enter them at the gate. We are fully prepared, waiting for instructions from you.' \".\n\nA senior officer in the 8200: \"Hamas training is intended for 'wasah', the scenario is unrealistic\"\n\nFortunately, on July 12, for the first time, a senior intelligence officer on the scene responded to this dense email suit. Although the same officer praises the counterman for her work, he agreed that \"the exercise looks crazy\" and \"it's probably about gold\", but he cooled her observations and added: \"But the scenario of the exercise described according to what the counterman wrote at the beginning is completely imaginary. And we need to see where we filter What is intended for the purpose of 'wasach' and the display of purpose, and what is realistic.\"\n\nEven after the senior officer did not take her warnings seriously, the police officer insisted not only on the information she brought - but also on its meaning: \"I firmly deny the existence of the imaginary scenario. It is hard for me to imagine that it was intended to practice an imaginary scenario and to raise morale, in my eyes this scenario is very Probable - mainly because Hamas has the execution capabilities.\"\n\nOne of the opponent's colleagues joined her position in his own email: \"I emphasize that we completely and emphatically disagree with the assumption that this is an imaginary scenario,\" he wrote. The permanent woman further emphasized that this could be, \"an operative plan without a timetable for implementation.\" In other words: we will not be able to give a warning in time.\n\nThe opposition even insisted that according to the information in her possession, this was a strategic event. In her words: \"This is a plan designed to start a war.\" She also quoted the senior Hamas terrorists who are organizing for the attack, and chanted battle cries such as \"Prepare to kill the Jewish pigs\" or \"Prepare to go in and decapitate.\" Beyond the battle cries, she emphasized: \"They are training, with large forces, for a big event. This is not a presentation of purpose, this is preparation for the real thing.\"\n\nDid this information make it to the top? Amn head Aharon Haliva does not write in these emails. He denies in the ears of his associates that he knew about him at all.\n\nThese emails are an important part, but only part of an overall picture, which includes both a military and intelligence level that failed, and a political level, that is, the Prime Minister, who received warnings in the months leading up to this campaign - that the internal crisis with us increases the chance of escalation, as Chaim Levinson revealed in the Haaretz newspaper, and hurts our deterrence, and because Hamas also recognizes this crisis as an opportunity for us.\n\nThe IDF spokesman's response: \"These days the IDF is entirely focused on fighting the terrorist organization Hamas. After the war the IDF will conduct a thorough, incisive and uncompromising investigation and publish its findings to the public.\"",

FYI, Jerusalem Post characterizes the channel as &quot;the cheerleader-in-chief for the political opposition.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mako.co.il/news-military/6361323ddea5a810/Article-92d67e4f8f11c81026.htm\">https://www.mako.co.il/news-military/6361323ddea5a810/Article-92d67e4f8f11c81026.htm</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Disclosure of &quot;Fact&quot;: Details of the dramatic correspondence from Unit 8200: &quot;Death in the Kibbutz, at any cost&quot;</strong><br/>\n<em>This email correspondence has been troubling Unit 8200 for the past few days - and rightly so \u2022 Tonight we revealed for the first time exactly what the veteran resistance fighter who predicted the Hamas attack wrote - and the reaction of the senior commander: &quot;a completely imaginary scenario</em></p>\n\n<p>This evening (Monday) we revealed for the first time the internal correspondence within Unit 8200, and the things written by the veteran resister from the unit - about the raid planned by Hamas deep in Israel. This, after Nir Debori revealed for the first time that her opponent had warned her direct commanders about the threat scenario .</p>\n\n<p>On July 6 of this year, the esteemed counterintelligence officer who specializes in the Hamas arena, sent an email entitled &quot;Death in the Kibbutz, at any cost.&quot; In the same letter, she detailed that &quot;at the end of May, there was a crazy training session, of two companies in Nocha in the presence of a number of senior Hamas officials.&quot; The training It was, according to the same letter, &quot;long and exhausting, lasting from the morning until eight thirty in the evening&quot;. The training included mounted forces, both on jeeps and on motorcycles. The terrorists practiced a scenario of shooting down an aircraft - both a fighter plane and a helicopter.</p>\n\n<p>According to the old permanent woman, the main exercise of the Hamas terrorists focused on taking over a kibbutz, which they gave it an invented name, and even practiced waving their flag over the synagogue and the kibbutz&#39;s secretariat. Another target marked by the terrorists: some military training base. &quot;An instruction was given to kill the entire crew,&quot; wrote the protester, adding a sting: &quot;The woman is always right.&quot; The protester signed off her email with a quote from an American philosopher: &quot;The art of reason is knowing what to ignore - and what not to.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The opposite party&#39;s colleagues did not ignore, and responded: &quot;Wow, this is crazy,&quot; wrote one of them. &quot;Amazing product&quot;, &quot;golden intelligence&quot;, responded one of the officers. &quot;Finally we are in the tactical plan of the Hamas preparations.&quot; Indeed, within three days, another opponent in the unit reported additional training, of additional battalions in Hamas, with each battalion training on its own target.</p>\n\n<p>After the report on the additional training of the murderous terrorist organization, the opposition sent another email: &quot;A cute little addition - during the training, the following conversation took place: &#39;How are you and what is your state of readiness, waiting for instructions from you so that we can enter them at the gate. We are fully prepared, waiting for instructions from you.&#39; &quot;.</p>\n\n<p>A senior officer in the 8200: &quot;Hamas training is intended for &#39;wasah&#39;, the scenario is unrealistic&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, on July 12, for the first time, a senior intelligence officer on the scene responded to this dense email suit. Although the same officer praises the counterman for her work, he agreed that &quot;the exercise looks crazy&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s probably about gold&quot;, but he cooled her observations and added: &quot;But the scenario of the exercise described according to what the counterman wrote at the beginning is completely imaginary. And we need to see where we filter What is intended for the purpose of &#39;wasach&#39; and the display of purpose, and what is realistic.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Even after the senior officer did not take her warnings seriously, the police officer insisted not only on the information she brought - but also on its meaning: &quot;I firmly deny the existence of the imaginary scenario. It is hard for me to imagine that it was intended to practice an imaginary scenario and to raise morale, in my eyes this scenario is very Probable - mainly because Hamas has the execution capabilities.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>One of the opponent&#39;s colleagues joined her position in his own email: &quot;I emphasize that we completely and emphatically disagree with the assumption that this is an imaginary scenario,&quot; he wrote. The permanent woman further emphasized that this could be, &quot;an operative plan without a timetable for implementation.&quot; In other words: we will not be able to give a warning in time.</p>\n\n<p>The opposition even insisted that according to the information in her possession, this was a strategic event. In her words: &quot;This is a plan designed to start a war.&quot; She also quoted the senior Hamas terrorists who are organizing for the attack, and chanted battle cries such as &quot;Prepare to kill the Jewish pigs&quot; or &quot;Prepare to go in and decapitate.&quot; Beyond the battle cries, she emphasized: &quot;They are training, with large forces, for a big event. This is not a presentation of purpose, this is preparation for the real thing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Did this information make it to the top? Amn head Aharon Haliva does not write in these emails. He denies in the ears of his associates that he knew about him at all.</p>\n\n<p>These emails are an important part, but only part of an overall picture, which includes both a military and intelligence level that failed, and a political level, that is, the Prime Minister, who received warnings in the months leading up to this campaign - that the internal crisis with us increases the chance of escalation, as Chaim Levinson revealed in the Haaretz newspaper, and hurts our deterrence, and because Hamas also recognizes this crisis as an opportunity for us.</p>\n\n<p>The IDF spokesman&#39;s response: &quot;These days the IDF is entirely focused on fighting the terrorist organization Hamas. After the war the IDF will conduct a thorough, incisive and uncompromising investigation and publish its findings to the public.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

The events have been mentioned here, so I think this update should be shared too. US Naval Insitute News's Heather Mongilio is now reporting that the destroyer USS Mason was not the target of the ballistic missiles. \n\nIt's either a hell of a coincidence, a lie for deescalation, a show of force with the Houthis deliberately missing the US ship, an attempt by the Houthis to hit another nearby target, or something that I can't think of now.\n\n---\n\nA commercial tanker and the U.S. destroyer that responded to its distress call were likely not the targets of a missile shot from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, the Pentagon press secretary told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe Pentagon now believes at least one missile was fired by Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters. While it was initially reported that two missiles were fired and fell about 10 nautical miles from USS Mason (DDG-87), Ryder said that the Department of Defense can now only confirm the Houthis fired at least one missile.\n\nRyder could not say the missile\u2019s target, referring reporters to the Houthis on Tuesday. The missile launched about an hour and 40 minutes after Mason\u2018s crew boarded M/V Central Park in response to its distress call, Ryder said Monday.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to our forces, as I highlighted, we\u2019re going to do whatever we need to do to ensure that they stay protected.

The five individuals were picked up by Mason\u2018s crew while attempting to flee in the direction of Yemen. One of the questions that remains about the alleged Somali pirates who attempted to take M/V Central Park is how they knew the oil tanker is owned by an Israeli businessman.\n\nCompanies often use liability shielding, which makes it hard to determine who might own or charter a ship, Campbell Unversity professor Sal Mercogliano told USNI News Monday.\n\nThe Department of Defense is still determining where the Somalis came from, their motive and their target, Ryder said.\n\nhttps://news.usni.org/2023/11/28/houthi-missile-likely-did-not-target-uss-mason-m-v-central-park-dod-says",

I recognise the US retains serious SEAD capability...but does anyone else?

Names have been omitted to protect the soldiers and their relatives.\n\n>The voices in these calls are of men who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t flee mobilization. Some had no money, no education and no options. Others believed in patriotic duty. One worked in a meat processing plant, cutting bone. Another worked at a law firm. A third, who worked as a roofer and later at a supermarket company, had a string of debts and had defaulted on his utilities payments, records show.\n\n> It is hard to say how representative these calls are of sentiment in Russia\u2019s armed forces, but their desperation is matched by a spike in legal cases against soldiers in Russia who refuse to fight.\n\n> What\u2019s happening in Ukraine is \u201csimply genocide,\u201d the soldier in Kharkiv told his brother. \u201cIf this s--- doesn\u2019t stop, then soon we\u2019ll be leading the Ukrainians to the Kremlin ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nArticle continues with details of the calls.

However, according to two other Kommersant interlocutors, this problem is not considered a serious risk. **\u201cIn general, all risks are small against the backdrop of general consolidation,\u201d** explains one of Kommersant\u2019s sources.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, this should be the 'manifesto' written as a 'reply' to the sentiments expressed in the article by the officials, found on 'Puty Domoy' telegram (https://t. me/PYTY_DOMOY/452)\n\n> The way home\n\n> Family to the people\n\n> The multinational people of Russia!

This was after there were reports of Russians using blocking detachments in the Kherson defense. </p>\n\n<p>In hindsight it is incredibly easy to judge this as an overoptimistic  or even propagandist view of the war. At this time however it was not an unreasonable prediction for how events had played out. Ukraine had just stopped multiple Russian offensives, retaken all the territory around Kiev, and undertaken two very successful offensives to retake much of Kherson and Kharkiv Oblasts. The idea that they could do the same with zhapirizia was entirely within the realm of possibility.</p>\n</div>",

The trick with the DoD is that ultimately there is no one watch dog, there are literally hundreds at every level. Take your example of an SoF soldier walking off with a bag of cash. Can it happen? 100%. But think big picture about how he got that bag of cash in the first place, very likely it passed through many hands who all share in some responsibility for its fate and have to report both to higher ups and inspectors as to the whereabouts of such funds. Handled on a project/operation basis, and not a total DoD one, there can be a ton of accountability for individuals who try to defraud the government. In theory. In practice, YMMV. An SoF guy is ironically likely under a ton more scrutiny than some jerkoff in the Air National Guard. \n\nSo yes there is theft and malfeasance, and likely a significant amount of it. But it is fundamentally individualistic and anarchic, not systemic and organized. Its not so much that there is a racket embezzling billions, rather people or small groups deciding they have a chance somehow to get theirs thinking nobody will notice. Sometimes theyre right, often times (I hope) theyre wrong.\n\nAnd this is just focusing on actual criminality. Procurement, R&D, and the funding of actual legit programs is where the graft is.

        "body": "A few days ago I posted a study by Mediazona which looked at the number of loan repayment deferrals under a law that provides such deferrals to mobilized and volunteer soldiers as well as their family members. The data showed something like 8500 new deferrals monthly. I then checked the Russian Central Bank stats to see how many Russian households had outstanding loans - which turned out to be slightly below 50%. Applying that percentage to the number of new loan deferrals led me to arrive at the number of around 20000 volunteer soldiers in Russia monthly.\n\nNow I've decided to compare that to other places. My first thought was Japan during WW2 - first, because I'm fluent in Japanese and thus have access to data, and second because I think current day Russia is closest to WW2 Japan in terms of ideology and culture. So I did a very quick google search and came up with [this study](https://kwansei.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/17460/files/119-1.pdf) (in Japanese) which mostly looks at the draft statistics in Japan during WW2 but does also look at volunteers. Citing Japanese Imperial Navy data, the study claims peak volunteer numbers for the Navy in 1944 with a total of 208660 volunteers in that year, or about 17000 monthly. It doesn't give a concrete number for the Japanese Army but does mention that the Navy had a much higher number of volunteers. So, being generous, we could place the monthly number of volunteer soldiers in Japan in 1944 at 30000 men. \n\nTo me this comparison highlights just how extremely high the Russian numbers are - Japan was putting out that number of volunteers during a time when the country was whipped into a militaristic craze *and* was facing a credible existential threat. Russia does believe they're facing a credible existential threat too, but the urgency obviously isn't the same as 1944 Japan. It's a worrying sign for future conflicts.\n\nI would like to invite the community to post more statistics concerning the number of volunteer soldiers in modern conflicts. This was just WW2 Japan.

I'm not sure I think I can accept that just 150k people joined the Japanese Army in 1944, while things were bad the Army remained a viable field force until 1945 when it was thoroughly dismantled by the Red Army. Not a good force, and I would believe that losses outweighed replacements. But those numbers seem too grim. \n\nWhat I would believe though is that your numbers are capturing a slice of recruitment data without getting the full picture. Namely, ethnic Japanese recruited from the home islands, without picking up on ethnic Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese recruited/conscripted on the mainland. Particularly as regards Koreans, who were drafted by the tens of thousands into rear area units, and who were administered separately from the home islands. Put another way, I bet there are a few thousand or more not showing up in those statistics who were conscripted in a form of shadow draft which tapped into the larger empire. Russia does something similar, but to a much smaller scale.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Now I&#39;ve decided to compare that to other places. My first thought was Japan during WW2 - first, because I&#39;m fluent in Japanese and thus have access to data, and second because I think current day Russia is closest to WW2 Japan in terms of ideology and culture. So I did a very quick google search and came up with this study (in Japanese) which mostly looks at the draft statistics in Japan during WW2 but does also look at volunteers. Citing Japanese Imperial Navy data, the study claims peak volunteer numbers for the Navy in 1944 with a total of 208660 volunteers in that year, or about 17000 monthly. It doesn&#39;t give a concrete number for the Japanese Army but does mention that the Navy had a much higher number of volunteers. So, being generous, we could place the monthly number of volunteer soldiers in Japan in 1944 at 30000 men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This to me doesn&#39;t pass the smell test.

It's an incentive but I don't buy that it would such a deciding factor that it would skew the distribution in the way you suggest. Moreover, the incentive applies not just to the soldiers, but to their family members - so a deferral doesn't mean a soldier is impoverished or even that he has an outstanding loan.

When I interviewed him last year, he complained \u2018that several small groups that call or called themselves \u201cleft\u201d, in fact, have become personnel serving the Kyiv authorities, supporting imperialism and war, denying the existence of Nazism in Ukraine, rejoicing about repressions against left-wing activists and the banning of left-wing parties.\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Always with the talk of Nazis. Ukraine has plenty of issues. Nazism is one of the few they <em>don&#39;t</em> have an issue with, unless your bar for a Nazi problem is so low that every nation on Earth would have one.</p>\n</div>",
