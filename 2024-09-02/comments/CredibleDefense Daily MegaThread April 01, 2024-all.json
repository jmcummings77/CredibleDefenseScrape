This isn't [1913](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff16478752e33c78727fbc5854ba5062-lq) where troops are supposed to fight from trenches by stand on a firing step to shoot, that's a good way to get hit by fires, especially when open top trenches make it ridiculously simple to spot moving personnel with drones. \n\nThe main line of resistance in modern warfare and this war in particular is thin, between not enough troops by far and a need to disperse due to the recon fires threat. That means dispersed platoon sized strongpoints that are primarily designed for anti-amor roles to defend key terrain features, with each having numerous squad sized outpost positions pushed well forward (hundreds of meters). Those are a mix between observation/listening posts, sentry positions, trip wire positions. The outpost line is meant to alert the main line of when and where a concerted attack is coming, buy them time and provide them intelligence about the enemy, while defeating all limited attacks and probes. The strongpoints are designed to actually stop the larger attacks.\n\nThose troops in those positions, be it outpost or strongpoint, need to be able to defend themselves while taking direct and indirect fire. If not, they'll be easily suppressed and overrun. If they are to fight back, to be able to continuously fire their weapons into their sectors (including ATGMs), especially covering those minefields you mention, they need proper cover. \n\nTo minimize the threat from flanking fires, they need protection to the sides. To minimize airbursting threats and to provide concealment from the air, they need overhead cover. To minimize threat from frontal fires they need to minimize their exposure with more frontal cover, so apertures. All of that means a bunker.\n\nBunkers need not only be placed correctly to cover essential sectors, not only protected enough to allow the troops to do their jobs and fight from them, but they need to be camouflaged too. And they need to be built with redundancy so loss of any one of them doesn't necessitate a sector being unobserved, which creates a weak point that ground assaults are looking to exploit.\n\nTrenches are also called communication trenches, they're meant to connect bunkers so troops can move from position to position without exposing themselves to enemy fire or sight. With this war, with the heavy use of drones, trenches also need to be camouflaged from above (though rarely are). Besides bunker fighting positions, trenches also need dugouts, which are highly protected positions to hide from heavy incoming fires (meant to survive against all but direct hits by the heaviest enemy positions), but also are often used as rest areas for troops too. \n\nShitty positions with no concealment, where Russian officers at tactical HQs can eat their popcorn watching drone footage showing UAF troops moving to and from positions within trench lines, allowing them to even positively identify dugouts, command posts, ammo supply points, are what are glide bomb magnets, they allow them to plot the grids for obvious targets. Especially when they also can see perfectly well that the positions aren't built strong enough to even stop a 122mm shell, let alone a 500 kg bomb. \n\nBoth sides are following politically driven strategic policies that denies them the ability to conduct a mobile retreat. Preferably, especially since the Russians and Ukrainians both follow older Soviet doctrine, they would want to perform a maneuver defense, where outposts can retreat at will, where platoon in their strongpoints retreat before being decisively engaged (fixed in place, maneuvered on or around). Instead they tend to hold ground at all cost in a forward defense, meaning they remain in one place as long as possible, preferably forever. That means these positions become known to the enemy attacker, who have time to plan fires and attacks to exploit weaknesses.\n\nBecause those bunkers are to be held for extended periods, those positions need to be even stronger than normal. Over time the enemy will figure out where they are located, what sectors they control, will reduce their obstacles, will remove any camouflage through fires, and then the only thing saving them will be how well they're built. If well, the troops inside can fight from them longer than if they suck. If the suck, the troops will be overrun more easily, destroyed in place by fires, or more likely they'll retreat beforehand without orders, citing their inability to do their jobs without it being suicidal.\n\n>and Russia is very effective at minefield clearing, the reason they still lose so many vehicles to mines is that Ukrainian units are using land/air drones to constantly place new fields in the grey zones.\n\nRussia is bad at minefield clearing. Ukraine too. Both still follow old crappy Soviet doctrine, with their assault column typically led by a single tank with a mine plow/roller, which has little survivability against a prepared AT minefield. You can see the combat footage, almost no AFV have breaching equipment attached to them. That means if the lead vehicle is disabled, the column is screwed. \n\nCompare that to the US Army doctrinal combined arms breach where an entire mechanized engineering platoon is assigned to EVERY lane, often two engineering platoons for the sake of redundancy. And most of the tanks assigned to support the breach also have mine plow/rollers too. MICLIC is used to create the breach, plows/rollers are only used to proof it, not to clear it. \n\nThe Ukrainians barely even have enough RAAMS to lay mines with arty, and those are exposed when they land. The Ukrainians can use those occasionally, drop a TM-62 mine by drone (also leaving it fully exposed) or send the occasional soldier out into no man's land to quickly lay a single AT mine, and that those threats still serve as an effective obstacle to the Russians is indicative of how bad their breaching capabilities are.",

For two years they've been there and what did they build? Barely anything, including as part of a forward defense. Without needing to actually defend against an attack that hasn't happened, and without any fortification projects, what were those defending units doing to occupy themselves? Boring guard duty, playing video games, watching movies and TV shows on streaming services, and sleeping. They should have been digging as if their lives and their nation depended on it, which they do. But their officers weren't forcing them to, because there was no pressure on their officers from on high. \n\nThose defenses don't even need to be tied in laterally as so much of that area is either heavily forested/swampy, filled with rivers, the Russians would have to travel on limited roads. But they'd need to be built in depth so that the Russians can take the forward defensive position without the whole of the operational sector collapsing because the Ukrainians have nowhere to retreat to besides hasty positions. \n\nAnd THAT is the biggest problem as to why the UAF didn't develop more fixed fortifications until now. It requires not only budgeting and foresight, it requires a mindset where retreat isn't a curse word, which is the case for UA strategic leadership. Any retreat is unacceptable, should not happen, \"Hold at all cost\" is THE  strategic policy and has been since the war started. \n\nAvdiivka is a perfect example. It was 3/4 encircled since early 2023 and yet they didn't develop fall back positions. Why? The UAF weren't allowed. Tactical units are required to perform a forward defense only, so all planning, manpower, equipment and funding goes to that. \n\nWe know for a fact that the UAF rotate elements of their maneuver brigades at different echelons of lines, they just don't fortify past the first. Why? \n\nMike Kofman and Rob Lee said a big reason is that the UAF don't have separate engineering units like the Russians, only those organic to their maneuver brigades. I checked, that's wrong, every UAF regional operational command has a separate engineer brigade. They're just not meant for building defenses in depth, because that's part of their plans and assignments.\n\nThe UAF don't retreat unless forced out, they clearly don't plan to retreat, so they don't pour the resources and effort into projects that are only used after retreating. If guidance from the highest leadership is that retreat is unacceptable, there is absolutely no reason to even contemplate a nationwide strategic plan to start building elaborate defensive fortifications starting about ~10 kilometers from the front lines (must be outside standard arty and drone range for a proper engineering effort), and going even further back build in depth (multiple belts).\n\nLook at the maps of the fortifications provided in the [Tweet](https://twitter.com/clement_molin/status/1774780075491078173) mentioned by the OP They're all well behind the existing front lines, for the Ukrainians to use them they need to retreat into them. Has that ever seen likely until recently? Even now they're not retreating into them despite the existing front line fortifications in many operational sectors being grossly insufficient, especially with the glide bomb threat (which require reinforcement concrete and steel to withstand), holding barely defensible ground, etc. \n\nNow they don't really have a choice. Even if top UA leadership didn't want to build them (and clearly didn't), public opinion is forcing them to. Building defenses wasn't their idea, it was forced on them. But clearly not enough because they're not forced to withdraw into those newly constructed better defenses, which will definitely save UAF lives, because like the Russians the Ukrainian leadership are entirely focused on terrain over all other metrics. Retreat equals lost ground, better to not even contemplate that.\n\nLuckily for them, the Russians are just as shortsighted too. Opening a new front doesn't need to be as big, complicated and insane as the initial invasion. Look at the UA paramilitary Belgorod incursions, the Russians could have done something like that anywhere across the border much more effectively than that shitshow Russian Freedom Nazi Corps or whatever they call themselves. A reinforced division would be sufficient with hints it could be bigger, big enough to threaten the Ukrainians to force them to commit units to defend in an otherwise quiet sector, either committed from meager strategic defense or transferred from elsewhere on the front lines weakening them somewhere else. And with a lack of good defensive fortifications to man, it means more UAF units will be needed to defend. \n\nAnd the Russians did actually have the resources plenty to perform such an offensive. Since late 2022 they've created multiple entirely new operational sized formations and committed them to battle, just not to new operational fronts rather than current, involving the Donbas predominantly.",

As to how long repairs will take, there is a wide range of damage inflicted, spare parts available, complexity of fixes, etc. Some refineries have resumed production, others at 60% of capacity, while others are still down (the GS estimate is as of last week.) Tuapase, for example, is still entirely offline 2 months after the attack. Report estimated a mid ten-digit loss of revenue for 3 months of interruptions. Further, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-01/russia-plans-to-cut-diesel-export-by-sea-in-april-to-5-month-low) today that seaborne exports will be down 21% sequentially due to the strikes.

Several other companies like HK, Beretta and FN make their own hybrid stoner rifles that are broadly similar. They use an AR-18 derived gas system.

What kind of muddies the water a bit is the name for the commercial version of the XM7 is the MCX SPEAR which sounds pretty similar.

It was an obvious abuse of diplomatic protocol to put it mildly.\n\nThe British embassy in Dublin was [burned to the ground](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_the_British_Embassy_in_Dublin) by protesters during the Troubles. It didn\u2019t mean Ireland and Britain were in a state of war. \n\nWhat exactly it is your point?

Unsurprisingly Ukraine was very similar for most of the time, the NATO aspirant however is changing in basically all respects and it appears questionable how comparable even those two countries are now. Probably better to assess both in their own right. I haven&#39;t seen much information about the fate of Ukraine&#39;s SOF though, irrespective of branch, maybe this is why anyone rather takes on Russia.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Russia/the USSR the distinction has always been a little less clear than in the west, not helped by the vagueness of Spetsnaz as a title.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not a title, it&#39;s a (portmanteau) word. And if you like the nearest available translation. Different languages/cultures do not distinguish, or even recognize in the same ways, that wouldn&#39;t be new I hope. Nor is it any way specific to Russia. The special forces construct as we know it is quintessentially Western in origin, or really Anglo- if you prefer. It&#39;s just that some others decided it&#39;s cool, and tried to copy it, more or less successfully. Russia&#39;s not one of those.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Not defending any position, but the logic is two-fold, even though the arguments aren't necessarily distinct:\n\n1) To achieve the goals (e.g. 1.5\u00b0C max warming), there should be 0 new fossil fuel projects. So they take aim at any that can influence: Those at home, and those dependent on players at home (e.g. German companies faced critics for providing infrastructure for Australian coal mining). \n\n2) Fossil fuel extraction projects always have high investment costs and hence longer time frames to pay off. Anything new that is built is expected to bring in profits (=cause global warming) for at least 20 years. It goes somewhat beyond that, too: If the Western fossil giants really would bet everything on renewables, they would also be lobbying hard for subsidies to support that transition. On the flipside, any further investments into fossils will make them lobby to maintain fossils in the economy for long enough for them to turn a profit (with somewhat of a spiral: Less policy support & subsidies, less renewable projects, less lobby for them, less policy support, ...). Foreign fossil fuel players don't really have the same lobby power where it matters (the West is still the biggest market, and has a tendency to shape policy beyond it).\n\nEnvironmental activists (in the vast majority) see their issue as the largest/most pressing issue humanity is facing and can do something about, and they are well aware of the science that says the time to act was, at latest, 10+ years ago (if not way more). To still achieve the goals, radical action is required: Radical energy transition, yesterday. They are aware they are radicals, and they are willing to take into account costs asspcoated (e.g. reduction of industrial output & reduction of GDP, or at least, overcoming the GDP growth imperative).

So they take aim at any that can influence: Those at home, and those dependent on players at home (e.g. German companies faced critics for providing infrastructure for Australian coal mining). </p>\n\n<p>2) Fossil fuel extraction projects always have high investment costs and hence longer time frames to pay off. Anything new that is built is expected to bring in profits (=cause global warming) for at least 20 years. It goes somewhat beyond that, too: If the Western fossil giants really would bet everything on renewables, they would also be lobbying hard for subsidies to support that transition. On the flipside, any further investments into fossils will make them lobby to maintain fossils in the economy for long enough for them to turn a profit (with somewhat of a spiral: Less policy support &amp; subsidies, less renewable projects, less lobby for them, less policy support, ...). Foreign fossil fuel players don&#39;t really have the same lobby power where it matters (the West is still the biggest market, and has a tendency to shape policy beyond it).</p>\n\n<p>Environmental activists (in the vast majority) see their issue as the largest/most pressing issue humanity is facing and can do something about, and they are well aware of the science that says the time to act was, at latest, 10+ years ago (if not way more).

New LNG export terminals take years to come online</strong>, doing nothing for near-term needs but locking in long-term climate pollution and consumer costs.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is <strong>Europe\u2019s near-term import needs are covered by existing exports.</strong> European gas consumption fell in 2023 and existing LNG import terminals are already underutilized, leading <strong>analysts to forecast a European supply glut by 2025.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduced European demand means without Biden\u2019s pause, LNG exports could flow to nations that oppose our national security interests</strong>: From January 2022 through September 2023, <strong>China was the top destination for new American LNG contracts</strong>, 13% of the global total, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The economic play on LNG for oil and gas companies isn\u2019t abundant domestic energy supplies \u2013 it\u2019s selling gas produced here to other countries regardless of America\u2019s national interests.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>LNG Exports Cut Domestic Supplies, Adding Domestic Costs</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The article continues if you want to read more).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Okay now a quick comment about partisan politics:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?cycle=2024&amp;ind=E01\">It is a fact that the oil and gas industry donates disproportionately to Republicans.</a>. Draw your own conclusions about why Republicans care so much about this particular rider being included in Ukraine funding.</p></li>\n<li><p>The funding of Ukraine is already a partisan issue in the house. We cannot pass a bill because of House Republicans. Is this good or bad? I&#39;m not passing a value judgement. It&#39;s simply a fact and shouldn&#39;t be danced around.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

                "body": "I'm a OIF veteran myself, who spent two years in Iraq, one during the bloody Surge in 07-08, the other including being in the \"last\" US combat brigade to leave Iraq in 2010 (after that, they were only advise-assist brigades not meant to perform any combat duties). Besides my own military service (as an infantry NCO), I spent years afterwards reading every book, article, report, etc that I could find to better understand what actually happened during \"my war.\" \n\n**You are dead wrong in your assessment.** \n\nWhen we handed Iraq over to the Iraqi govt, as part of the SOFA agreement, it was pacified and the typical Iraqi city was less violent than the typical American city. That was due to successful execution of COIN doctrine.  \n\nWe broke the back of the Sunni Arab insurgency with the Al Sawah/Awakening Movement, which capitalized on growing hatred between the rank and file moderate insurgents and especially their tribal leadership and the hardcore Salafi insurgents, most notably Al Qaeda in Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq, who were already pissing off the locals with their extremist tactics. \n\nStarting in 2006 in Anbar Province, the US partnered with Iraqi tribes against AQI, standing up militias to take control of the local areas, driving AQI out as the local former insurgents turned militia knew exactly who they were, where they lived, where their caches were located, where their safe houses were, who supported them, etc. The Awakening spread to the rest of the Sunni Arab areas of Iraq through 2007, by the second half of that year the daily number of Significant Actions (SIGACT), violent attacks against Coalition forces, Iraqi Security Forces, or civilians, had plummeted. \n\nHalfway through my first deployment, all spent in the \"Sunni Triangle,\" it went from me thinking it would be pure chance to spend 15 months without getting at least seriously wounded, to being shocked at how boring and quiet it had become. My second deployment, also in the Sunni Triangle, was absolutely boring. Zero action, no IEDs, no ambushes, no firefights, there was almost no fighting happening period. \n\nThe Shi'a insurgency, dominated by the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigade (and other Iran proxy groups) was also broken in 2007-8. Partly by the US, especially punishing the Mahdi Army in their uprisings. But mainly it was Maliki and the Iraqi Army who did it, crushing the Basra uprising in 2008, which was only possible because the US trained them, assisted with the clearing operation, etc. That forced al-Sadr to come to terms and agree to both a cease fire and to disband. \n\nThe US didn't squash the Badr Bde, they were tied to the Iraqi govt, with so many of them moonlighting in Iraqi Security Forces, but when they knew the SOFA was going to kick after Bush signed that agreement, they recognized there was no point attacking US forces anymore so they stopped, also around 2008. With Baghdad largely ethnically cleansed of Sunnis by that point, they also laid off the death squads, especially after the US/British SOF dismantled the AQI terror cells that were deliberately targeting Shi'a civilians with mass casualty events to purposely start a secular civil war, JSOC's army of face-shooting Tier 1 assaulters and brainiac secret squirrels ended that threat through a campaign of intelligence directed raids that is still absolutely awesome to contemplate. \n\nIraq went to shit after we pulled out because the US wasn't there anymore. Maliki was left to do as they pleased, and he really wanted to terrorize the Sunni Arabs into compliance, which was a huge mistake. When GWB was POTUS, he spoke almost daily to Maliki on the phone offering guidance, coordinating, etc, and that kept him in check. After Obama became POTUS, he spoke to him once, and then washed his hands of Iraq after the pullout. When the US left and quit involvement in Iraq in 2011, done and no longer \"answering the phone\" that created an enormous power vacuum which Iran filled, who were also pressuring Maliki to crack down on the Sunni Arabs. \n\nTHAT is what caused the DAESH Uprising. The Sunni Arabs were even trying to address political issues non-violently, but Maliki cracked down on them with state-directed violence and mass arrests in 2012-2013, and that was what broke the camel's back and restarted the sectarian civil war. At that point, the largest, bloodiest, most well-funded insurgent group was Al Qaeda in Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq, who had recently been fighting in Syria for the past two years developing even more effectively violent means of terrorism and warfare, had renamed themselves Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (Syria), and the rest is history. \n\nBut that was not a failure of US COIN doctrine, which was to seek local solutions to problems, to use whatever means we had (including bribery) to win locals over to our side, to emphasize non-violent means of problem-solving over violent (such as setting up new businesses to grow their economy, a role every US military combat arms unit commander was performing), to live among the people, to share their dangers, to learn to know them, etc.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m a OIF veteran myself, who spent two years in Iraq, one during the bloody Surge in 07-08, the other including being in the &quot;last&quot; US combat brigade to leave Iraq in 2010 (after that, they were only advise-assist brigades not meant to perform any combat duties). Besides my own military service (as an infantry NCO), I spent years afterwards reading every book, article, report, etc that I could find to better understand what actually happened during &quot;my war.&quot; </p>\n\n<p><strong>You are dead wrong in your assessment.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>When we handed Iraq over to the Iraqi govt, as part of the SOFA agreement, it was pacified and the typical Iraqi city was less violent than the typical American city. That was due to successful execution of COIN doctrine.  </p>\n\n<p>We broke the back of the Sunni Arab insurgency with the Al Sawah/Awakening Movement, which capitalized on growing hatred between the rank and file moderate insurgents and especially their tribal leadership and the hardcore Salafi insurgents, most notably Al Qaeda in Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq, who were already pissing off the locals with their extremist tactics. </p>\n\n<p>Starting in 2006 in Anbar Province, the US partnered with Iraqi tribes against AQI, standing up militias to take control of the local areas, driving AQI out as the local former insurgents turned militia knew exactly who they were, where they lived, where their caches were located, where their safe houses were, who supported them, etc. The Awakening spread to the rest of the Sunni Arab areas of Iraq through 2007, by the second half of that year the daily number of Significant Actions (SIGACT), violent attacks against Coalition forces, Iraqi Security Forces, or civilians, had plummeted. </p>\n\n<p>Halfway through my first deployment, all spent in the &quot;Sunni Triangle,&quot; it went from me thinking it would be pure chance to spend 15 months without getting at least seriously wounded, to being shocked at how boring and quiet it had become. My second deployment, also in the Sunni Triangle, was absolutely boring. Zero action, no IEDs, no ambushes, no firefights, there was almost no fighting happening period. </p>\n\n<p>The Shi&#39;a insurgency, dominated by the Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigade (and other Iran proxy groups) was also broken in 2007-8. Partly by the US, especially punishing the Mahdi Army in their uprisings. But mainly it was Maliki and the Iraqi Army who did it, crushing the Basra uprising in 2008, which was only possible because the US trained them, assisted with the clearing operation, etc. That forced al-Sadr to come to terms and agree to both a cease fire and to disband. </p>\n\n<p>The US didn&#39;t squash the Badr Bde, they were tied to the Iraqi govt, with so many of them moonlighting in Iraqi Security Forces, but when they knew the SOFA was going to kick after Bush signed that agreement, they recognized there was no point attacking US forces anymore so they stopped, also around 2008. With Baghdad largely ethnically cleansed of Sunnis by that point, they also laid off the death squads, especially after the US/British SOF dismantled the AQI terror cells that were deliberately targeting Shi&#39;a civilians with mass casualty events to purposely start a secular civil war, JSOC&#39;s army of face-shooting Tier 1 assaulters and brainiac secret squirrels ended that threat through a campaign of intelligence directed raids that is still absolutely awesome to contemplate. </p>\n\n<p>Iraq went to shit after we pulled out because the US wasn&#39;t there anymore. Maliki was left to do as they pleased, and he really wanted to terrorize the Sunni Arabs into compliance, which was a huge mistake. When GWB was POTUS, he spoke almost daily to Maliki on the phone offering guidance, coordinating, etc, and that kept him in check. After Obama became POTUS, he spoke to him once, and then washed his hands of Iraq after the pullout. When the US left and quit involvement in Iraq in 2011, done and no longer &quot;answering the phone&quot; that created an enormous power vacuum which Iran filled, who were also pressuring Maliki to crack down on the Sunni Arabs. </p>\n\n<p>THAT is what caused the DAESH Uprising. The Sunni Arabs were even trying to address political issues non-violently, but Maliki cracked down on them with state-directed violence and mass arrests in 2012-2013, and that was what broke the camel&#39;s back and restarted the sectarian civil war. At that point, the largest, bloodiest, most well-funded insurgent group was Al Qaeda in Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq, who had recently been fighting in Syria for the past two years developing even more effectively violent means of terrorism and warfare, had renamed themselves Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (Syria), and the rest is history. </p>\n\n<p>But that was not a failure of US COIN doctrine, which was to seek local solutions to problems, to use whatever means we had (including bribery) to win locals over to our side, to emphasize non-violent means of problem-solving over violent (such as setting up new businesses to grow their economy, a role every US military combat arms unit commander was performing), to live among the people, to share their dangers, to learn to know them, etc.</p>\n</div>",

Politically, both suffered from poor political planning and direction from the upper echelon, especially the WH.  \n\n**Lessoned Learned**\n\nEffectiveness over time in regard to military doctrine cannot be assessed through the lens of political failures, there is plenty of knowledge about how to fight a counter-insurgency, and the US military leadership was aware of it - hell I have many books on it, one not the least is the Counter-Insurgency Field Manual by the US.\n\nKnowing a thing and acting on a thing are two different things and politics can often make the two incompatible.  If you ask the average infantryman/officer who served in places like Iraq and Afghanistan they can give you a pretty solid answer about how to fight a counter-insurgency.  If you ask the average political leader who served in Iraq and Afghanistan they will probably give you a solid answer \"what insurgency?\"\n\n**What it takes**\n\nThe answer overall to the OPs question of what lesson could the US tell Israel about CI?  Don't, don't get into one.  If you are going to occupy a foreign nation then commit to occupying it with the forces, logistics, political will, and mission parameters necessary to do so.  Control every in/out of the area, provide absolute security and safety for the local populace, and disrupt any potential resistance before it can grow enough strength to inflict massive harm.  \n\nWhen figuring out what sort of force you need for this occupation whatever you first think, double it, and then when you feel like you have enough, double it again.  To pay for this occupation never pay for it out of your own pocket.  Again the starting advice is don't, but if you are going to do it, then do it someplace where you can extract wealth from the area so that the occupation pays for itself, including the cost of fixing what you or the enemy broke/breaks, and any bribes necessary for peace.  \n\nIf you are going to \"nation build\" focus on providing the basic needs for the population, safety, food, water, and something to do that isn't fighting you.  Then commit to doing it for at least 2 generations. Find experts who understand the local customs, traditions, and history, and don't try to fit whatever notion you have about the place to force a goal or governance foreign to the population - at least at first.  Do not try to change everything overnight - again commit to being there for generations.  \n\nAfter generations of peace, stability, and ingrained political and social ties between both nations offer pathways to independence.  If you have extracted wealth from the country that paid for the occupation and fixed the basic needs of the people, it has likely had enough economic development from foreign nations (including you) that the local population has a better standard of living and amenities. Good, a happy more prosperous group of people won't want to return to pre-occupation standards.  If you failed and the pre-occupation is seen (especially by the young) as better than it way is now, don't end the occupation.  However, if you do it right not only can the country no longer be a threat to you, it could become an ally.\n\n**Israel's path**\n\nNow, in Israel, is Gaza a foreign nation?  Not according to them.  Does it have a wealth to extract?  Besides foreign aid, no not at all.  Can you occupy land that your people will claim as their own and the people of that land claim your land as their own?  No.  Israel doesn't have much to learn from the US because the situation is completely different.  \n\nForeign adversaries wanted the US to leave Iraq/Afghanistan, something insurgency can accomplish.  When foreign adversaries want you to leave your own country - that is war.  The only way Israel \"wins\" in Gaza is to go to war with the country that financially, materially, and \"spiritually\" supports it.  Iran.  Otherwise, it will continue to do the *every generation Israel needs to go into Gaza, kill a bunch of military-aged males*, then leave again and suffer whatever level of terrorism stems from that.\n\nIf the Israeli political and public will is to have an end to that conflict then they will find some way to destroy Iran and they will need to have the West's support to do so.  It will influence Western elections and media to build a consensus and power to commit to war with Iran and seek secret support from Iran's enemies (such as SA).\n\nThe only other option is to hope to use intelligence agencies to finally topple the regime in Iran, however, there is a ticking clock for either option.  If Iran gets a nuclear bomb - war is very difficult.  If Iran gets the bomb and the regime falls, terrorism could be harder.\n\nYou should be able to get an idea if Israel is going to go to war with Iran as it would need to start preparing now.  \n\n* One, is significant foreign aid from the West to build/sustain airstrikes and an expeditionary force that could participate in some type of campaign (even if it is some special forces operation).  \n* Two, mobilization and preparation of military retaliation that would require Israel to attack/occupy any foreign power that has ties to Iran that could be used against Israel.  So Syria and Lebanon. (Likely to occur first.)  \n* Three, a change in political leadership in Washington that is vehemently pro-Israel/anti-Iran and willing to strike Iran.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nI would expect to see Israel not accept any ceasefire if they intend to take care of Iran in a required two-year time frame, they need to completely lockdown Gaza and remove any perceived threat because fighting Iran will mean doing this all over again.  Israel will need foreign aid and the attention of the US, so while Israel stockpiles its own weapons, it will either pressure the US to completely abandon all aid to Ukraine in favor of itself or pressure the US to go all in on providing aid to Ukraine so that conflict can be over before war with Iran.  \n\nThe likelihood between either of these would lend to pressuring more aid to Ukraine as this keeps the US expanding inventory needed to fight Iran and it is much easier to get Israeli aid while also providing it to Ukraine due to US politics.\n\nIsrael can't probably go much beyond 2025 in its plan to decimate Iran without doing some sort of strike on Iran's nuclear program, but a strike like that could come whether Israel is committed to war or not.  It can not also afford to have China in conflict with Taiwan to drain US focus.  This will mean Mossad will either have to influence China to avoid the conflict or the US to pull away from its intent to protect Taiwan.\n\nThe next couple of years will be fascinating and then horrifying for how it could play out.",

Their equivalent of a maneuver brigade will have a single artillery battalion to support them, based on the older divisional structure where divisional artillery would have 3-4 artillery battalions, which were then distributed to those armies who went to brigade combat teams (US Army in particular). \n\nBut the Russian and Ukrainian mix is crazy high, their brigade's have two cannon artillery battalions, plus a cannon anti-tank battalion, plus a rocket artillery battalion. On top of that, they possess separate artillery brigades (of 3-4x battalions each) designed to support operational level HQ commands (CAA/Corps/Tank Army for the Russians, regional Operational Commands for the Ukrainians). \n\nWhy don't Western armies have more artillery? It has nothing to do with air support, it's because a century of trial and error have proven that the amount they possess already (3-4x less than the Russians and Ukrainians) is already very difficult to logistically support, especially in mobile expeditionary warfare, another reason for major expenditure rates in this war and supply problems (the Soviet Union was pretty terrible at logistics, as are Russia and Ukraine). \n\nRussian guns can generally outshoot the UAF guns because they'll have more ammo. Generally, it's very much time, location, and unit dependent. But that doesn't mean the UAF aren't shooting, just not shooting as much, so they have to pick and choose their fire missions better. \n\nThey tend to do far less preparatory fires for destructive fire missions, trying to turn enemy terrain into the Moon to erase defensive positions. The Russians do that a lot, especially in urban battles; where the UAF has not needed to attack anything larger than a village since the war started, the Russians have fought countless urban battles in full sized where they used artillery to rubble or flatten the cities. While those fire missions are destructive in terms of what they do to structures, they aren't too destructive to people, who are often hiding in sturdy basements while the artillery is landing.  \n\nAdditionally, with Ukraine being on the defensive, their fire rates would naturally be lower. Generally, artillery is used much more sparing defensively than offensively. Yes,  harassment and interdiction is often performed, and especially targeting assembly areas before an enemy attack (to catch them while they're assembling), but defending a position requires little to no lengthy prep fires (which consume the most amount of ammo), minus the occasional counterattack. So most of UAF fire missions done in this war are to stop Russian attacks, which means troops or vehicles in the open, where targets are outside of cover, the ultimate target-rich environment where arty has the most lethal effect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Ukraine took it a step further and also dissolved all tactical and operational level HQs above the brigade level, scrapping all their divisions and most of their corps, leaving only a single permanent command level between brigade and general staff, four regional Operational Commands. All done to save money by cutting down on the number of senior officer positions (generals make a lot of money), and because at the time they did it they didn't foresee a long-term threat that would require divisions, corps, or field armies.
