It appeared to cause a serious dilemma in the Ukrainian distribution of GBAD as well as attriting irreplaceable stocks of SAMs. Obviously it would have been more effective for the Russians to have been hitting directly militarily relevant targets but their capability in that regard has been called into question. Something is broken in the killchain and they just don't seem to be able to strike anything other than static targets at which point they're left with infrastructure, manufacturing, and major logistics hubs. The Ukrainians are going to do their level best to conceal the latter two but you can't really hide a dam or powerplant leaving them as some of the only really viable targets. \n\nAnother point to consider is the, in my opinion, rather shocking resilience of the Ukrainian electrical grid. I don't think there was any real question of if critical national infrastructure would manage to keep the power on but I was absolutely expecting civilian blackouts to last significantly longer and I'm looking forward to the eventual write-up of how the Ukrenergo engineers kept things going so well.

Michael Turner of Ohio, the Republican chairman of the committee, which serves as the House's main body for overseeing American intelligence organizations, spoke alongside three other GOP congressmen during a brief visit to Kyiv.\n\n>\u201cThere are those on the left and on the right who question continued support or the amount of support. That will certainly be part of the debate,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBut overwhelmingly, there is support for continuing aid to Ukraine, so that they can continue to fight against this aggression of Russia.\u201d\n\n>The trip to the Ukrainian capital was the latest effort from top-ranking Republicans in the House, who are laying the groundwork for continued U.S. assistance but facing opposition in their own ranks. Emboldened by former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach, many on the right are clamoring for the Ukraine aid to come to an end, creating the potential for a politically bruising fight when the current American assistance runs out.\n\n>For instance, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely Trump rival for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, recently suggested that defending Ukraine in a \u201cterritorial dispute\u201d with Russia was not a significant U.S. national security priority. He later walked that statement back following criticism from other members of the party.\n\n>With the war in Ukraine now entering its second year, Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah said the American people would continue supporting aid as long as U.S. resources were being used judiciously.\n\n>\u201cThis is going to take some time,\u201d he said of the war. \u201cThat\u2019s not surprising. Most conflicts such as this between nation-states take time to resolve themselves. I think the American people understand that, as long as they feel like progress is being made over being careful with the money and being thoughtful of how we involve U.S. resources.\u201d\n\n>Stewart, who is also on the intelligence committee, said NATO members should also fulfill their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\n>\u201cMost of them have not done that except for a few of the smaller countries,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe American people also look at this and go, \u2018This is in Europe\u2019s backyard. They should be at least as invested in this as we are.' And I don\u2019t know that we can assure them right now that that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\n>Rep. Rich McCormick of Georgia noted that nations have rallied to Ukraine\u2019s support.\n\n>\u201cFor the first time, maybe ever, countries were talking about putting pressure on each other and holding each other accountable inside of NATO,\u201d said the congressman, who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. \u201cThere is a new sort of urgency that never existed before, that I think you\u2019re seeing Europe actually step up to the plate like they\u2019ve never done before.\u201d\n\n>The fourth member of the delegation to Kyiv, Rep. Darin LaHood of Illinois, another member of the intelligence committee, said the visit to Ukraine was aimed at observing the situation on the ground from \u201cthe illegal, unprovoked war that Putin engaged in here.\u201d\n\n>That, he said, \u201cwill help us as we go back and have to make decisions on further funding and further support for this conflict.\u201d\n\n>Also in Kyiv to underline the importance of support for Ukraine was former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who joins a long list of potential Republican candidates for the presidential nomination.\n\n>\u201cWhy is it that the United States should expand its resources and its people\u2019s resources to support the effort here that you all are engaged in? I think it is pretty straightforward,\u201d Pompeo said Monday during an event organized by prominent Ukrainian businessman Victor Pinchuk. \u201cIf we have learned one singular thing\" that is that \"when bad guys begin to march, they do not stop marching.\u201d\n\n>Asked about the dissenting voices in the United States, Pompeo said that \u201cyour president has asked for equipment. He hasn\u2019t asked for our young men and women. So long as we stay in that place, I\u2019m convinced that most American leaders will see it that way and will support the continued efforts.\u201d\n\nThough not new, am personally mildly surprised by LaHood and Pompeo's black/white positions on this issue. Still believe what I said a couple months ago: Trump *may* not run, which would leave DeSantis relatively unopposed to track to the right, given that all the other presumptive hopefuls are fairly united on this issue.

This answer a lot of your other Qs\n\nWhy not just bypass these lightly defended areas entirely using mobility?\n\n- Cause those are not the only defenses, lookup trench warfare a bit, those are \"outpost defenses\".

Whatyou are talking aboutispossible onve you breached the defenses in a massive gap and you vam drive through significant forces that can go and do a lot of different things in different places, like the Ukrainians did at Kharkiv. They were able to do so cause the defenses were lightly manned, one hole was able to pump theough forces wothout stopping, deiving forward, turning back to open a second \"gate\" by encirclement, attack HQ and multiple targets back the line. This is not the case right now.\n\nhow was armor used in Kherson where the fighting was much harder and more evenly matched.\n\n- as far as I know pretty similar.

Basically they out run the defenses and used the chaos. They had a plan and the russians didnt or not for the scale they got attacked by) However, Ukrainian tactics, while still rooted in Soviet doctrine are more flexible, bit like how western armies should operate. However losses of veteran NCOs might have mitigated it somewhat. What happened in Kherson was a strategic victory, achieved ny a \"slugfest\". Destory bridges, precsion strike logistics and support your partisans to degrade russian capabilities to adaquetly supply their beached on the west aide of the Dniper. After/during that all you had to do is attack constantly. russian high command made the right decesion of pulling back, cause all that remained is to die there.

Of course armor alone wont gonna do it, they would need full combined arms for a real breakthrough, with SEAD for at least a few days, infantry and artillery and demining vehicles. The whole package.

Each single Tornado-S can provide fire support in an area 400 times as large as a TOS-1A - and, whilst that is obviously reductive given that much of that area will be behind your own lines, it still highlights just how costly it would be to procure enough thermobaric weapons systems to have consistent coverage of the frontlines.\n\nIn cases like the siege of Mariupol, with known, static fortifications, and a much lessened risk of counter battery fire, it's different.

Given how politics has flipped on the Ukraine War, it also seems like a very bad political move right now to conceal millions of spent dollars from Congress, who is already looking for an excuse to bug out.\n\nRegarding actual equipment, very little is being sent because there is so little to send. There are no HIMARS, not for Ukraine, not for Poland, not for the USMC. There are very few working Leo2s, and nobody who has them wants to give up the few they have. There is almost no stock of 155mm left. Europe's military situation since the end of the Cold War has gotten quite poor, with only France and the UK having very active militaries and then only limited to expeditionary forces. Spain wanted to give Leo2s, except their got hit by a flood and (surprise) never got fixed. So now they have to be refurbished. Germany has tanks that dont run (and it doesn't want to give). Poland has already given more than most every other member of NATO, but has its own security to worry about.\n\nAnd then you get into institutional politics. Germany has been a reluctant contributor of certain systems. They have Marders and Leos and all the rest, they just feel uncomfortable giving them. The US could *maybe* do it themselves, who knows. We dont know what the older Brads in storage look like, nor what the Brads in active service look like. Even more thorny, neither the Army nor Nat Guard will want to give up what they have because theyre terrified that whatever they give today will not come back tomorrow when the budgetary pivot to China happens. This is callous and self centered, but almost certainly correct. The Army wont be getting any more Brads, and its successor is probably a decade and a half a way, they havn't even delivered prototypes of the \"Optionally Manned Vehicle\" program, perhaps because nobody can figure out exactly what \"Optionally Manned\" means. Of course the Army still has missions its gotta accomplish, it needs to be ready for another war like Ukraine, a war in Korea, a war with China where *it* wants to be able to play. Its getting a new Abrams, but were stuck between design and delivery. The USMC was able to give a bunch of weapons for Ukraine thanks to its Force 2030 goal, *but* all that is gone now and the USCM is telling people it is *the* solution to the Chinese island problem. And anyway, one thing that stretches across administrations, and is truly bipartisan, is the feeling that the EU (which is the largest economic block in the world) could really afford to pay for its own defense. So why, as a progressive might ask, is the US yet again passing on healthcare and roads so that Western Europe can continue to miss even the bare minimum funding targets *they agreed to* in NATO? And yet Germany has, by reports, not yet spent one Euro of its 100bn pledge.\n\nThis is all to say that 'just give more' isn't really that easy. There isn't a lot more to give, and what there is already spoken for. Militaries dont run surpluses, and outside of Russia basically nobody keeps weapons maintained they dont plan to use. In fact, militaries are very strictly resource limited, though it doesn't always seem that way. Nobody has extra to give, because no legislature (even in the US!) is willing to pay for what they dont need. In Europe this has been acute, while in the US there is more on hand, but more spoken for as well. Not only does the US Army take its global commitments seriously, but it has to rhetorically maintain the message its been putting out since the 1990s. Its, as one might expect, inconvenient to be proven a liar in front of Congress after all. But all this means that the US is set up to defend its own interests directly, but *not* to act as the arsenal of democracy. Its got 90 days of good fighting in it, optimistically, and thats it.",

This isn't really aimed at you, but is more so a feeling I've had since aid was first announced:\n\n\nYes, a single artillery piece, tank, or man is not enough to win a war. But wars cannot be won without artillery pieces, tanks, or men. In terms of resources, there exists a point between 0 and infinity that enables victory. It's impossible to know what that point is, but it does exist.\n\n\nThe individual protester does not have enough power to enact change. But a sufficient number of them *can* enact change (see Maidan). One ounce of snow does not cause an avalanche, the millionth might. One tank does not (generally) win a battle, but the 100th might.

But wars cannot be won without artillery pieces, tanks, or men. In terms of resources, there exists a point between 0 and infinity that enables victory. It&#39;s impossible to know what that point is, but it does exist.</p>\n\n<p>The individual protester does not have enough power to enact change. But a sufficient number of them <em>can</em> enact change (see Maidan). One ounce of snow does not cause an avalanche, the millionth might. One tank does not (generally) win a battle, but the 100th might.

The reason for this is the layer of ionization the builds up around things traveling more than mach 5 in the lower atmosphere.  This layer blocks all EV radiation.  That means if the missile is guided, it uses inertial guidance, as in the type of guidance that can't hit moving targets.  Moving targets like aircraft carriers.  Those carrier killer missiles you think would keep carriers at arm's length are just a bluff.  Either they slow down to the point that they are just another cruise missile (in which case, SeaWiz) or they can't hit a moving target.  Doesn't matter how they engineered these missiles, its the same conclusion either way.

Since Radev has been known to be somewhat power hungry it is *possible*, though perhaps unlikely he chose the date to be the same as the finnish. \n\nMontenegros presidential elections have a two round system, with a second round only if the first round is inconclusive with noone receiving at least 50% of the vote.

Montenegros new president is also not as anti-serbian as the previous, which some see as a sign that he is seeking union with serbia, which could strengthen belgrade to be a counterweight to brussels.

This is a rough estimate based on a bunch of reasonable guesses. **TLDR: we would expect to see this about twice per year or more.**\n\nThere are 44 countries in Europe. In almost all of them, there are at least a few different types of elections (local, regional, parliamentary, presidential rounds 1-2, maybe a second chamber, maybe by-elections, some referendums, the European parliamentary election, snap elections...), that are almost always organized on Sundays to avoid conflicts with the work week. Let's say these are on average 4 years apart each, and that the average country has 4 types of elections. That would give us about one regularly scheduled election per year per country, which feels about right in my experience living in a European country.\n\nSo 44 regular elections every year, plus a bunch of irregular snap elections and whatnot. Across all of Europe, this would give us roughly one election per Sunday - but they can overlap, so there can be Sundays with no elections or Sundays with more elections. The \"statistically neutral\" guess of this variation would be a Poisson distribution with mean 1 [election per week]. According to Wolfram Alpha, the chances of having three elections on one Sunday would then be about 5%, or 1 in 20 Sundays. \n\nSo statistically it's pretty damn common to have three European elections on one Sunday. You'd maybe expect to see it a bit more than twice a year.\n\nNote that if we alter the hidden assumption in the choice of Poisson distribution (uniform distribution), we would expect *more* \"clumping\" of elections on the same days, not less.",
