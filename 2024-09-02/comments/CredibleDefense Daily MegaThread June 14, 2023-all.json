This is part of a gradual tightening of defenses in response to Ukraine\u2019s growing ability to reach the strategic city. Despite the wider focus on missiles and maritime drones, Russia evidently takes the threat of Ukrainian special forces seriously\n\n>Evidence seen by Naval News shows that the number of dolphin pens has increased. Analysis suggests that the number of animals has increased from 3-4 to 6-7. \n\n>The implication is that dolphin patrols have increased in frequency and/or cover more area. The animals will defend against Ukrainian special forces divers, known as combat swimmers, who might otherwise infiltrate the base. The marine mammals have an inherent advantage against even the most athletic combat swimmer; no one can out-swim a dolphin. \n\n>For this reason several countries have at times trained dolphins and other marine mammals for this role. The most famous program is in the U.S. Navy\u2019s. But the first was in Sweden, and it is suspected that Israel, North Korea and possibly other countries also have programs.  \n\n>Russia deployed the trained animals to a position on the north side of the harbor entrance at the beginning of the 2022 invasion. There was already a training center for dolphins and beluga whales just outside the city, dating from Soviet times. The dolphins are native species but the belugas were flown in from colder waters. The facility had briefly been part of the Ukrainian Navy before being seized by Russia following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. \n\n>The facilities and their activities were increased under Russian control. The dolphins were occasionally deployed to Novorossiysk and even Tartus in Syria.\n\n>Today the dolphins are part of a complex multi-layer defense. Outside the harbor a special purpose ship, supported by helicopters and fast boats, guards against surface and underwater threats. This is supported by at least two DP-64 \u2018Dam\u2019 rocket-propelled depth charge systems. The harbor entrance itself is blocked by no less than five layers of nets and floating barriers. These also try to block both surface and submerged approaches. \n\n>The dolphins are inside these barriers (\u2018booms\u2019) and will patrol against divers who might have slipped through. Based on observed practices the dolphins can be moved around the base on small boats. A cradle, resembling a tent, is used when the dolphins are inside the boat. \n\n>Inside the main boom defenses there are several more sets of booms across the harbor and its smaller bays\n\n >The base also has increased air defenses. An SA-15 Gauntlet (\u2018Tor\u2019) missile system is parked on the sea wall near to the depth charge rocket launchers. Another SA-15 has been strapped to the helipad of a patrol ship which is anchored further inside the base. These have a range of up to 12 km (7.5 miles) although in practice it may be less. All the same they add considerably to the close in defenses of the base. \n\n>Zooming out, the base and its approaches are also covered by anti-ship missiles, specialist artillery and S-300/S-400 long-range air defenses. Fighter jets, many based on Crimea, and electronic warfare (EW) round out the defenses.\n\n>Russia has also increased defenses in other bases and ports around Crimea. And similar defenses have started appearing in key submarine bases in the Arctic, far away from the Ukrainian threat.\n\n>Sevastopol should not be viewed as an impenetrable fortress however. Ukrainian maritime drones have penetrated the defenses several times, and Ukraine will no doubt be aware of weaknesses. Which is likely why Russia has felt the need to increase the dolphin defenses.\n\nI went to this article expecting a paragraph or two about dolphins and came out instead with a master level analysis of Russian defenses around Sevastopol and elsewhere.",

The dolphins were occasionally deployed to Novorossiysk and even Tartus in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Today the dolphins are part of a complex multi-layer defense. Outside the harbor a special purpose ship, supported by helicopters and fast boats, guards against surface and underwater threats. This is supported by at least two DP-64 \u2018Dam\u2019 rocket-propelled depth charge systems. The harbor entrance itself is blocked by no less than five layers of nets and floating barriers. These also try to block both surface and submerged approaches. </p>\n\n<p>The dolphins are inside these barriers (\u2018booms\u2019) and will patrol against divers who might have slipped through. Based on observed practices the dolphins can be moved around the base on small boats. A cradle, resembling a tent, is used when the dolphins are inside the boat. </p>\n\n<p>Inside the main boom defenses there are several more sets of booms across the harbor and its smaller bays</p>\n\n<p>The base also has increased air defenses. An SA-15 Gauntlet (\u2018Tor\u2019) missile system is parked on the sea wall near to the depth charge rocket launchers. Another SA-15 has been strapped to the helipad of a patrol ship which is anchored further inside the base. These have a range of up to 12 km (7.5 miles) although in practice it may be less. All the same they add considerably to the close in defenses of the base. </p>\n\n<p>Zooming out, the base and its approaches are also covered by anti-ship missiles, specialist artillery and S-300/S-400 long-range air defenses. Fighter jets, many based on Crimea, and electronic warfare (EW) round out the defenses.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has also increased defenses in other bases and ports around Crimea. And similar defenses have started appearing in key submarine bases in the Arctic, far away from the Ukrainian threat.</p>\n\n<p>Sevastopol should not be viewed as an impenetrable fortress however. Ukrainian maritime drones have penetrated the defenses several times, and Ukraine will no doubt be aware of weaknesses. Which is likely why Russia has felt the need to increase the dolphin defenses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I went to this article expecting a paragraph or two about dolphins and came out instead with a master level analysis of Russian defenses around Sevastopol and elsewhere.</p>\n</div>",

Importantly these targets were all close to the frontlines near Velka Novosilka. </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve also seen GMLRS recently used to target Grads, SPAAGs/SAMs, and Russian troop concentrations. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were also being used to target individual hard points (pillboxes, ATGM nests, bunkers, etc) in Russia&#39;s defensive lines as part of this offensive, essentially acting as a kind of CAS for Ukrainian ground forces in lieu of aircraft able to perform the role. </p>\n\n<p>It made sense to reserve GMLRS for use against more important targets previously, but as Ukraine has received new capabilities and Russia has reduced the number of high value targets within GMLRS range, there is a lot of value Ukraine can get from using them tactically instead.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "In the beginning, 2014-2015, there was definitely a group of people who participated in things like rallies, building of barricades that helped the pro-RU fighters. It is unknown how much though.\n\nMy thinking is that the majority of the population doesn't participate in such political actions anyways. It is a small minority of people which get accepted by the majority through silence and inaction, which contributes to the legitimacy of the minority. For example, I claim that without the sending men like Girkin, without the manpower and resource support from Russia, the common people cannot just randomly start waging war against the government and survive.\n\nDo you notice how in places like Slavyansk and Kramatorsk nowadays, you don't hear about pro-RU people even though there was literally an event called the siege of Slavyansk in 2014?

It is a small minority of people which get accepted by the majority through silence and inaction, which contributes to the legitimacy of the minority.

I would not be surprised if CD has a notable minority of Russian posters. </p>\n\n<p>I guess what I mean to say is that the reality of the Russian situation (strained on the defense, with a lot of mixed results and outlooks) is not going to be the <em>dominant</em> narrative. It will be easier for a random Westerner to stumble into Z propaganda than the private chat of some anxious zoomers in Ryazan.</p>\n</div>",

The world is chasing systems, and production processes require time, and not everyone has the time to wait,\u201d Kulas says.\n\nHe notes that many European countries are seeking to quickly replenish supplies after donating billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms to Ukraine that have helped it push back Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u201cThere are two potential countries with which we are holding advanced negotiations [on a sale of the Mervaka tanks],\u201d he says. \u201d I am barred from naming them, but one is on the European continent.\u201d\n\nThe Merkava has been the IDF\u2019s main battle tank since the 1980s.
