        "body": "In Ukraine, Russia is Beginning to Compound Advantages.\nby Dr Jack Watling\n\nhttps://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/ukraine-russia-beginning-compound-advantages\n\n> By stretching Ukrainian forces along a wide front, Russia is overcoming the limitations of its undertrained army.\n\n>Russia has now started the early phases of its anticipated summer offensive with renewed attacks on Kharkiv. Over the past few days, Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border, occupying a number of villages. Ukraine has spent several months fortifying Kharkiv, but storming the city is not how Russia intends to fight. The Russian target this summer is the Ukrainian army, and against this target it has started to compound its advantages.\n\n>**The Long Front**\n\n>The Russian forces attacking Ukraine have now expanded to 510,000 troops. This means that Russia has established significant numerical superiority over the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Heavy losses among Russia\u2019s officer corps and more capable units earlier in the war have reduced its capacity to conduct large-scale offensive ground manoeuvre. The Russians have been limited to conducting platoon and company attacks, rather than brigade or divisional operations, meaning that they rarely decisively overmatch Ukrainian defenders at any one location. With such overall numerical superiority, however, Russia has begun to turn this limitation to its advantage.\n\n>The front in Ukraine spans almost 1,200 km. Along Ukraine\u2019s northern border, near Chernihiv, Russian sabotage groups continually probe Ukrainian positions. A large group of forces near Belgorod, meanwhile, has long threatened to push towards Sumy or Kharkiv, and has made its presence felt with fire. The main focus of Russian efforts has been in Donbas, but in the south Russian troops have also been skirmishing along the Zaporizhzhia front and have even conducted amphibious raids across the Dnipro. They have met with little success, but the breadth of their attacks has fixed Ukrainian troops on the line of contact and forced the AFU to spread out its artillery, expending munitions to break up successive Russian attacks. This dynamic has prevailed for the last four months.\n\n>Having stretched the Ukrainians out, the contours of the Russian summer offensive are easy to discern. First, there will be the push against Kharkiv. Ukraine must commit troops to defend its second largest city, and given the size of the Russian group of forces in the area, this will draw in reserves of critical materiel, from air defences to artillery. Second, Russia will apply pressure on the other end of the line, initially threatening to reverse Ukraine\u2019s gains from its 2023 offensive, and secondly putting at risk the city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine should be able to blunt this attack, but this will require the commitment of reserve units.\n\n>Once Ukraine commits its reserves in these directions, the main effort will see the expansion of the Russian push in Donbas. This axis is already making slow but steady progress. The objective is clear: to cut Ukrainian supply lines connecting Kostiantynivka and Kramatorsk. The Russians hope that once Ukraine loses these roads that give the AFU localised interior lines, they will be able to push north and south, stranding Ukrainian artillery on one axis or the other. Russia\u2019s aim is not to achieve a grand breakthrough, but rather to convince Ukraine that it can keep up an inexorable advance, kilometre by kilometre, along the front.\n\n>**Death from Above**\n\n>Compounding the challenge for the Ukrainian military is the deterioration of its air defences. The depletion of Ukrainian tactical surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems has already allowed the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) to make their presence felt, delivering hundreds of UMPK glide bombs against Ukrainian positions each month. As the VKS can push closer in against a diminished air threat, the accuracy and therefore the lethality of these strikes will increase. Able to strike behind Ukrainian lines, the Russians are using them to bombard and thereby depopulate Ukrainian towns. This fixes the AFU forwards, defending positions for as long as possible even as the tactical situation deteriorates.\n\n>The diminishing Ukrainian SAM coverage has had another pernicious consequence, however. Prior to the full-scale invasion, Russian forces had long envisaged a reconnaissance strike complex allowing their troops to accurately detect and destroy targets behind the front lines. For much of the war so far, this aspiration has been curtailed by robust Ukrainian air defences. Now, however, Ukraine is having to save its SAMs to deter Russian jets. The result is that Orlan-10 UAVs are now roaming far and wide over the front lines. They are routinely flying over both Kharkiv and Zapporizhzhia.\n\n>The growing density of Russian UAVs deep over Ukrainian positions is enabling Russia to set up dynamic strikes with operational tactical missile complexes like the 9M723 quasi-ballistic missile, or with long-range multiple launch rocket systems like the Tornado-S. In recent days Russia managed to strike a Ukrainian Buk air defence system and catch two Ukrainian helicopters on the ground while they refuelled. There have been other notable strikes of a kind that Russia has long aspired to but rarely successfully executed.\n\n>As SAM coverage shrinks, the Ukrainian military will face a very hard trade-off. It can continue to group air defences around critical national infrastructure such as power stations, or it can move them forwards to protect the front. The persistence of Russia\u2019s long-range strike campaign means that not only is the front being stretched laterally, but it is also being extended in its depth.\n\n>**Stabilising the Front**\n\n>The quicker that both SAMs and artillery ammunition reach Ukraine, the more slowly the AFU will be forced to cede ground. In the immediate fight, there is a direct correlation between the speed of supply from Ukraine\u2019s international partners of artillery ammunition and air defence interceptors and the speed of deterioration at the front. So long as the AFU lacks sufficient means to blunt Russian attacks along its front, Russia will be able to force Ukraine to commit reserves and then exploit the axes left with insufficient troops and equipment. In other words, so long as Ukraine lacks materiel, Russia will begin to compound its advantages.\n\n>In the medium term, however, turning the present dynamic around is up to Ukraine and cannot be resolved by its international partners. Unless the AFU expands in size then it will continue to be overstretched. The AFU must not only replace losses in its existing units, but also raise enough units to manage their rotation on and off the line. This allows troops to be trained as well as the recovery of reserves. Mobilising personnel for these new units and ensuring that there is a training pipeline for them is a task that only the AFU can initiate.\n\n>There is, nonetheless, an area where the support of Ukraine\u2019s partners is critical. If Ukrainian forces lack enough key enablers \u2013 artillery, air defences, electronic warfare complexes, and engineering vehicles - then the brigades that own the limited assets available will be fixed on the front. They cannot rotate away with their equipment. Battalions beneath the brigades may be moved on and off the line, but formations will be fixed and therefore unable to train or be dynamically redeployed. Ensuring, therefore, that the AFU can equip and train brigade staffs with the enablers necessary to fight as a brigade means that additionally mobilised personnel can be put to best use. This is an area where commitment from Ukraine\u2019s partners will be crucial.\n\n>The outlook in Ukraine is bleak. However, if Ukraine\u2019s allies engage now to replenish Ukrainian munitions stockpiles, help to establish a robust training pipeline, and make the industrial investments to sustain the effort, then Russia\u2019s summer offensive can be blunted, and Ukraine will receive the breathing space it needs to regain the initiative.",

Of these, only 300 million \u20ac remain (we are talking \u20ac to be spent, not effectuated deliveries). The MOD is asking for another 3.8 billion \u20ac for 2024, and it seems this will be granted, with the finance ministry sending positive signals (although they might preffer to reshuffle budgets rather than issuing debt to increase the total government budget, which could lead to some tension).\n\nFor 2025, the MOD is planning/asking for 15 Billion \u20ac of direct military aid to Ukraine. To put those numbers into perspective:\n\n[The 2021 German MOD budget was 45 Billion \u20ac, out of which 8 billion \u20ac for procurement, 1.5 billion for R&D, and 4.5 Billion for \"material maintenance\".](https://www.bmvg.de/de/themen/verteidigungshaushalt/verteidigungshaushalt-2021)\n\nSo, without adjusting for inflation, 2024/2025 German direct military aid to Ukraine totals to as much, or even more than total German military procurement in 2021, and 2025 direct military aid to Ukraine is 1/3 of Germany's 2021 defense budget. That's without counting financial aid, humanitarian aid, and the large share of German money in EU aid to Ukraine.\n\nQuestion: IIRC Germany contributed to the Czech shell initiative. Does this money also come from the \"biliteral military aid to Ukraine\" budget?",

The MOD is asking for another 3.8 billion \u20ac for 2024, and it seems this will be granted, with the finance ministry sending positive signals (although they might preffer to reshuffle budgets rather than issuing debt to increase the total government budget, which could lead to some tension).</p>\n\n<p>For 2025, the MOD is planning/asking for 15 Billion \u20ac of direct military aid to Ukraine. To put those numbers into perspective:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bmvg.de/de/themen/verteidigungshaushalt/verteidigungshaushalt-2021\">The 2021 German MOD budget was 45 Billion \u20ac, out of which 8 billion \u20ac for procurement, 1.5 billion for R&amp;D, and 4.5 Billion for &quot;material maintenance&quot;.</a></p>\n\n<p>So, without adjusting for inflation, 2024/2025 German direct military aid to Ukraine totals to as much, or even more than total German military procurement in 2021, and 2025 direct military aid to Ukraine is 1/3 of Germany&#39;s 2021 defense budget. That&#39;s without counting financial aid, humanitarian aid, and the large share of German money in EU aid to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Question: IIRC Germany contributed to the Czech shell initiative. Does this money also come from the &quot;biliteral military aid to Ukraine&quot; budget?</p>\n</div>",

Initial feedback is rolling in and it\u2019s not overwhelmingly positive, according to Army acquisition head Doug Bush.\n> \n> \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is where the challenges are with directed energy at different power levels,\u201d Bush told members of the Senate Appropriations airland subcommittee on Wednesday. **\u201cThat [50-kilowatt] power level is proving challenging to incorporate into a vehicle that has to move around constantly \u2014 the heat dissipation, the amount of electronics, kind of the wear and tear of a vehicle in a tactical environment versus a fixed site.\u201d**\n> \n> Dubbed the Directed Energy Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD), the service tasked Kord Technologies with integrating a 50-kilowatt class RTX laser onto a Stryker to down class one to three aerial drones and incoming rockets, artillery and mortars. In total, four prototypes were produced, and Breaking Defense first reported that all four were sent to the US Central Command (CENTCOM) region in February. \n> \n> Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James Mingus said at the time that the goal was to experiment in a live environment complete with weather challenges and dust storms that can alter light particles and degrade beam quality.\n> \n> \u201cYou may have a 50-kilowatt laser, [but] at 10 kilometers can you put at least four kilowatts in a centimeter square because \u2026 that\u2019s what you need to burn through a quarter inch steel plate?\u201d the three-star general asked. \u201cBut that\u2019s really hard to get \u2026 from a big beam to get the small portion of it on the exact spot to be able to burn at that high intensity and any kind of dust particle or that starts to disrupt that.\u201d\n> \n> Fast forward to today and soldiers are delivering some of that feedback, and **Bush said results from the lab environment and test ranges is very different from the tactical environment.**\n> \n> \u201c[Soldiers] will tell you everything and they\u2019re not worried about your feelings,\u201d Bush told senators.\n> \n> **While their initial input is not stellar for those Stryker-based prototypes, other high-energy lasers are proving to be more useful. In late-April, Military.com first reported that the service had also sent a 20-kilowatt Palletized High Energy Laser (P-HEL), overseas.**\n> \n> Bush did not name the P-HEL by name or disclose where it had been deployed, but told lawmakers that those 20-kilowatt class systems \u201care proving successful\u201d for \u201csome\u201d fixed-site setups. The service has also inked a contract with Lockheed Martin for a 300-kilowatt high energy laser weapon, dubbed the Indirect Fire Protection Capability-High Energy Laser (IFPC-HEL), but that has not yet been delivered to soldiers and tested out, he added.\n> By The Numbers\n> \n> The Pentagon has been developing such directed energy weapons for years but is now looking for ways to test them out and get them into the field. That pressure is only growing as the cost of shooting down low-priced drones grows.\n> \n> At the same time, the Army is grappling with a flat budget next year and opted to make cuts to an array of development coffers, including directed energy one\u2019s.\n> \n> Even before the DE-MSHORAD soldier feedback came in, Army leaders were planning cuts to that 50-kilowatt laser effort. In its fiscal 2024 budget request, for example, the Army included $110 million for DE M-SHORAD development and laid out a plan to spend nearly $126 million the following year. When the service delivered its FY25 budget request to lawmakers in March, though, it asked for $38 million less than anticipated, or $88 million. And it\u2019s not just a one year cut. Army leaders now plan to spend $445 million between FY26 and FY28 for program development, or about $186 million less than it projected spending last year over the same three-year stint.\n> \n> Next year\u2019s budget request also takes a swipe at Lockheed Martin\u2019s IFPC-HEL development with the service asking for just under $32 million, a sharp decrease from the $86 million it requested for FY24 and the $209 million it received in FY23. However, it noted that this cut is a natural \u201cprogression\u201d as prototypes are delivered and the effort transitions to a program of record.\n> \n> IFPC High Power Microwave (HPM) research and development also takes a hit. The Army\u2019s FY25 request asks for just over $4 million for next year, $11 million less than requested in FY24 and $41 million fewer dollars than received for FY23. While that development pot is reduced, the service had previously predicted that spending trajectory would decline. (That is, in part, due to this week\u2019s announcement that Epirus has delivered all four IFPC-HPM prototypes to the service.)\n> \n> As is the case with IFPC-HPM prototype deliveries marking a development milestone, service leaders propose coffer reductions for a variety of reasons, including budget constraints, testing schedules and program transitions out of development and into production. But reductions to the Army\u2019s directed energy portfolios have raised the eyebrows of at least one lawmaker, Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine.\n> \n> During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in April, those cuts prompted King to say to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth and Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, \u201cWhat in the hell are you people thinking?\u201d\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019d like to start with three data points: $10,000, $4.3 million and $12,\u201d he said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. \u201c$10,000 is the high-end estimate of cost of the drones that Iran and the Houthis are using, $4.3 million is the cost of one SM-6 missile, $4 million for the Patriot, [and] $12 [is] the cost of the directed energy shot that can take down one of these drones.\u201d\n\nWhat are the near-term prospects for how the US military can flesh out their drone defense capabilities?  It seems inevitable that any land-based conflict going forward is going to include such threats.  If lasers aren't viable in the immediate future, then should the US be procuring a system such as Skynex in quantity?  (or rather, Skynex mounted to a more mobile and survivable chassis than the typical one it has been demonstrated with).",

(That is, in part, due to this week\u2019s announcement that Epirus has delivered all four IFPC-HPM prototypes to the service.)</p>\n\n<p>As is the case with IFPC-HPM prototype deliveries marking a development milestone, service leaders propose coffer reductions for a variety of reasons, including budget constraints, testing schedules and program transitions out of development and into production. But reductions to the Army\u2019s directed energy portfolios have raised the eyebrows of at least one lawmaker, Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine.</p>\n\n<p>During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in April, those cuts prompted King to say to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth and Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, \u201cWhat in the hell are you people thinking?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to start with three data points: $10,000, $4.3 million and $12,\u201d he said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. \u201c$10,000 is the high-end estimate of cost of the drones that Iran and the Houthis are using, $4.3 million is the cost of one SM-6 missile, $4 million for the Patriot, [and] $12 [is] the cost of the directed energy shot that can take down one of these drones.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What are the near-term prospects for how the US military can flesh out their drone defense capabilities?  It seems inevitable that any land-based conflict going forward is going to include such threats.  If lasers aren&#39;t viable in the immediate future, then should the US be procuring a system such as Skynex in quantity?  (or rather, Skynex mounted to a more mobile and survivable chassis than the typical one it has been demonstrated with).</p>\n</div>",

Cut that to a third to get fighting age males and you get 25 million. How much did the 150k take out of the 25 million? Its 0.6%.\n\nRussia still has 24 million men to throw into the meat grinder if it really really really wants to.\n\nPre-war, Russia had an active duty strength of 1 million, they used 200k (all that can be spared for expeditionary duties) to start the invasion. They have now expanded it by at least 300k. So even with all the deaths, the army is now probably about 50% bigger than it was before the war.\n\nNow for society, well, I have lived there and the only news they get from the front is that they are winning. All the deaths they know of are just numbers on a screen happening to people not in Moscow that they have numerous degrees of seperation from.

Cut that to a third to get fighting age males and you get 25 million. How much did the 150k take out of the 25 million? Its 0.6%.</p>\n\n<p>Russia still has 24 million men to throw into the meat grinder if it really really really wants to.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-war, Russia had an active duty strength of 1 million, they used 200k (all that can be spared for expeditionary duties) to start the invasion. They have now expanded it by at least 300k. So even with all the deaths, the army is now probably about 50% bigger than it was before the war.</p>\n\n<p>Now for society, well, I have lived there and the only news they get from the front is that they are winning. All the deaths they know of are just numbers on a screen happening to people not in Moscow that they have numerous degrees of seperation from.

Russia would always have significant influence over Ukraine's future.
