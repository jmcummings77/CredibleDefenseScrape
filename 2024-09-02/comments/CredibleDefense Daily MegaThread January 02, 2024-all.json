      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

NK have never really caught any western spies in NK unless you count Otto Warmbier, Laura Ling, Euna Lee, or Travis King as spies.

Hezbollah has launched rockets there in the recent past, and it's likely that however far Israel drives them back, they'll return afterwards. Israel occupied a pretty large swath of southern Lebanon for over a decade, but 6 years after pulling out we had the Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel did manage to drive the PLO out of Lebanon and set up a security zone, but I don't think anyone is expecting another siege of Beirut (and driving Hezbollah out would be much more difficult than driving the PLO out). Likewise I don't see any indication that Israel is interesting in reoccupying South Lebanon long-term, the way they seem to be interested in re-occupying Gaza.\n\nAt the same time that doesn't mean that Hezbollah has the upperhand. It's limited in its ability to hit Israel (missiles and cross border raids), and Israel has a strong ability to respond. At the same time, its political power in Lebanon as a whole is a lot more precarious than Hamas' in Gaza.\n\nLow intensity border conflicts against hostile neighbors aren't anything new to Israel.

He's saying they're no longer interested in a German-style peaceful reunification through negotiations.

It is not a coincidence that early US and Soviet ballistic missiles were equipped with nuclear weapons, as basically they could be targeted to hit city sized targets. Even more modern tactical weapons of this kind were planned to be used with those during the cold war, as although they were more accurate, but not accurate enough to hit point targets, such as bridges, directly.\n\nAccording to wikipedia, the Burkhan-2 (being used by the Houthi) is a quite similar to Scud-C/Shahab-2 missiles, that have a CEP of 500 m. This means that 50% of the missiles will land in a 500m radius circle compared to the targeted epicenter. You can target a city block with it, but even for a large ship you would need probably dozens of missiles to hit it reliably. What makes the issue even more complicated is that the ships are moving. Although ballistic missiles are really fast, in most scenarios they still need minutes to reach their targets, during which they may move to a different place than expected.\n\nAlthough you can make them more accurate, but only few countries can do that, and even for them, they are much more complicated and much more expensive than simpler guided missiles. You would need systems that track the targeted ships from very long range and guide the missiles indirectly through most of the flight and still need sensor for the terminal guidance onboard the missile, which is challenging for such fast projectiles.\n\nIt may be worth to create such systems for China, as it is extremely difficult to get any missile close enough to an American aircraft carrier, and they have the money and the technology, but there are few other actual use cases. More conventional anti-ship missiles are way cheaper, unless the target is extremely well defended and you would need to launch hundreds of missiles and risk the losing of dozens of platforms during the attack.\n\nI think the Houthi are using ballistic missiles as they already have some (and probably it was not them who had to pay for them), and might as well try to be creative. They may get lucky, but it is not a really efficient way of attacking (moving) ships, as these weapons were not designed for such.

In South Lebanon Hezbollah can fire ATGM's from many km's away and multiple directions. it's much more difficult to secure an area against enemy fire. \n\nThe same also makes logistics far more difficult. In Gaza the IDF can push trucks pretty close to the front via secure corridors.\n\nCreating such in S.Lebanon is impossibly due to the hilly terrain and the aforementioned field of view of enemy ATGM teams. \n\nNot a general, but if you allow me to sit in my arm chair, taking the slow approach similarly to Gaza will not work. The IDF initially deployed a relatively small force into Gaza, just 1 division at first (North Gaza beach route) another a few days later (cutting the strip in two) and a part of a third one about a week later iirc in Beit Hanoun.\n\nThe size of the IDF forces in Gaza later increased.\n\nI believe to maximize chances of successful maneuver in Lebanon Israel must use a **much** larger initial force, hoping for a break through the first hill line into Hezbollah rear where they could maneuver. The IDF must have much much larger forces to densely fill the area for cross security.",

In South Lebanon Hezbollah can fire ATGM&#39;s from many km&#39;s away and multiple directions. it&#39;s much more difficult to secure an area against enemy fire. </p>\n\n<p>The same also makes logistics far more difficult. In Gaza the IDF can push trucks pretty close to the front via secure corridors.</p>\n\n<p>Creating such in S.Lebanon is impossibly due to the hilly terrain and the aforementioned field of view of enemy ATGM teams. </p>\n\n<p>Not a general, but if you allow me to sit in my arm chair, taking the slow approach similarly to Gaza will not work. The IDF initially deployed a relatively small force into Gaza, just 1 division at first (North Gaza beach route) another a few days later (cutting the strip in two) and a part of a third one about a week later iirc in Beit Hanoun.</p>\n\n<p>The size of the IDF forces in Gaza later increased.</p>\n\n<p>I believe to maximize chances of successful maneuver in Lebanon Israel must use a <strong>much</strong> larger initial force, hoping for a break through the first hill line into Hezbollah rear where they could maneuver. The IDF must have much much larger forces to densely fill the area for cross security.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "In case anyone wanted to know the reasons:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/deaidua/status/1741857264615538705\n\n\"Every week, people complain under my tweets about the low supply of 155 mm artillery ammunition by Germany to #Ukraine. With this tweet, I would like to take up a few theories, spread some facts and explain the situation to the best of my knowledge.\n\nFirst, I would like to point out that I can understand some complaints and yeah, it's true that Ukraine is suffering from a severe shortage of mortar and artillery ammunition. However, the situation in Germany has changed fundamentally in the past year, and it seems that almost everyone forgets this.\n\nFacts please!\n\nLet's start with a few facts. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Germany has delivered around 57,000 155-calibre shells to Ukraine. About 67.5% of this was delivering during the past year (2023).\n\nThe artillery ammunition supplied includes not only standard ammunition such as DM121, but also smoke shells such as DM125 and illuminating shells. Also supplied were an unknown number of highly effective top-attack shells SMArt 155 and 255 shells of various types of Vulcano ammunition, probably the most modern ammunition supplied to Ukraine in general.\n\nThe supply of ammunition and problems before the war\n\nLet's now focus on the supply of ammunition again. The big problem, especially in 2022, was that a large proportion of the supplies had to come from industry.\n\nEven before the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, there was a massive shortage of ammunition in the Bundeswehr (Germany's army) \u2014 and not just in the artillery sector.\n\nAmmunition worth between 20 and 40 billion euros was missing. This was demonstrated, for example, by the fact that German soldiers rarely practised with live shells.\n\nTo give you a figure: In June 2023, it was revealed that the Bundeswehr had just around 20,000 HE shells in its own stockpile. That's right, around 20,000! Large deliveries from Bundeswehr stocks were therefore hardly an option.\n\nThis also shows that hardly any ammunition was purchased from the industry in the years before 2022. In the four years before the start of the full-scale invasion (the press releases from Rheinmetall do not go back any further), the Bundeswehr only purchased 155-calibre artillery ammunition from Rheinmetall once in mid-2019. The order included the delivery of 32,000 DM121 shells.\n\nOther countries purchased from Rheinmetall just as frequently and in roughly the same volume. Production capacities were correspondingly low. Little was purchased for production, little was produced, and even less was ordered. That was the situation before 2022.\n\nAnyone expecting deliveries in the million figures directly from the army or industry is, to put it mildly, somewhat naive. Even though Rheinmetall has been receiving more and more orders since 2022 and the arms manufacturer has been increasing its production capacities accordingly, everything got off to a slow start.\n\nThe powder needed to produce the grenades, for example, has to be stored for six months before it can be used. There are no shortcuts that can be taken. This, for example, is also part of the explanation as to why so few 155 mm shells were delivered from Germany to Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAs already mentioned, Rheinmetall's production capacity is constantly improving. While the production capacity was around 60,000 to 80,000 shells per year at the end of 2022 (depending on the source), it was around 350,000 to 450,000 per year in mid/end-2023 (depending on the source), partly due to the purchase of Expal Systems. At the end of 2024, it is expected to be at around 700,000 shells per year.\n\nSome people are probably thinking, but then what's the problem? Only some of the ammunition is going to Ukraine. Armies around the world are rearming, not just in Europe or Germany in particular.\n\nTake the Bundeswehr, for example. Due to current NATO requirements, Germany's army must build up a stock of around 230,000 shells by 2031. So they have about 7 years to acquire the missing 210,000 shells and that is only the minimum requirement, and we are only talking about Germany.\n\nWhat is the current situation?\n\nLet's now have a look at the current situation. In my opinion, Rheinmetall is currently running at maximum capacity \u2014 at least as much as the company can handle economically. The Bundeswehr is now buying on a much larger scale, but not large enough for Rheinmetall to more expand its capacity.\n\nIn July last year, the Bundeswehr concluded a framework agreement with Rheinmetall worth 1.3 billion euros. It involves the delivery of hundreds of thousands of shells up to the year 2029! Of these, around 200,000 shells worth several hundred million euros have already been ordered for Ukraine. More for the Bundeswehr.\n\nHowever, based on media reports and statements by Papperger, Rheinmetall would like to see such contracts much more often and much more in volume. This is probably one of the reasons why the production of artillery ammunition at Rheinmetall was already 100% booked up for 2024 before the end of 2023.\n\nAnother reason is likely a lack of materials that are important for the production of the shells. On the one hand, there was a lack of essential explosives, and on the other hand, there was a lack of powder and linters.\n\nFor the first two problems, the plan was to expand existing production facilities in Germany and build new factories, but local politics have so far prevented this from happening. As far as I know, a solution is not yet in sight.\n\nThe latter problem lies with China. According to industry information, almost all European ammunition producers have purchased cotton linters from China (as of November 2022).\n\nWhile a delivery took around 3 months before COVID-19, it now takes 6 to 9 months or doesn't take place at all. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any more up-to-date information on this, so I don't know what the current status is.\n\nWhat will 2024 and the further future bring?\n\nAs already mentioned, Rheinmetall's production is already running at 100%. Around 200,000 shells will be delivered by Germany to Ukraine in 2024.\n\nThe German government has also awarded a contract to a French manufacturer, for example. The company is to supply 68,000 155 mm shells to Ukraine for 278 million euros. A further 282,000 shells are part of a framework agreement.\n\nUnfortunately, no time frame has been specified, but it can be assumed that large quantities will be delivered this year.\n\nFurther contracts for delivery to Ukraine have also already been awarded to Rheinmetall for the year 2025. A long-term supply is therefore guaranteed.\"",

In the four years before the start of the full-scale invasion (the press releases from Rheinmetall do not go back any further), the Bundeswehr only purchased 155-calibre artillery ammunition from Rheinmetall once in mid-2019. The order included the delivery of 32,000 DM121 shells.</p>\n\n<p>Other countries purchased from Rheinmetall just as frequently and in roughly the same volume. Production capacities were correspondingly low. Little was purchased for production, little was produced, and even less was ordered. That was the situation before 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone expecting deliveries in the million figures directly from the army or industry is, to put it mildly, somewhat naive. Even though Rheinmetall has been receiving more and more orders since 2022 and the arms manufacturer has been increasing its production capacities accordingly, everything got off to a slow start.</p>\n\n<p>The powder needed to produce the grenades, for example, has to be stored for six months before it can be used. There are no shortcuts that can be taken. This, for example, is also part of the explanation as to why so few 155 mm shells were delivered from Germany to Ukraine in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>As already mentioned, Rheinmetall&#39;s production capacity is constantly improving. While the production capacity was around 60,000 to 80,000 shells per year at the end of 2022 (depending on the source), it was around 350,000 to 450,000 per year in mid/end-2023 (depending on the source), partly due to the purchase of Expal Systems. At the end of 2024, it is expected to be at around 700,000 shells per year.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are probably thinking, but then what&#39;s the problem? Only some of the ammunition is going to Ukraine. Armies around the world are rearming, not just in Europe or Germany in particular.</p>\n\n<p>Take the Bundeswehr, for example. Due to current NATO requirements, Germany&#39;s army must build up a stock of around 230,000 shells by 2031. So they have about 7 years to acquire the missing 210,000 shells and that is only the minimum requirement, and we are only talking about Germany.</p>\n\n<p>What is the current situation?</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s now have a look at the current situation. In my opinion, Rheinmetall is currently running at maximum capacity \u2014 at least as much as the company can handle economically. The Bundeswehr is now buying on a much larger scale, but not large enough for Rheinmetall to more expand its capacity.</p>\n\n<p>In July last year, the Bundeswehr concluded a framework agreement with Rheinmetall worth 1.3 billion euros. It involves the delivery of hundreds of thousands of shells up to the year 2029! Of these, around 200,000 shells worth several hundred million euros have already been ordered for Ukraine. More for the Bundeswehr.</p>\n\n<p>However, based on media reports and statements by Papperger, Rheinmetall would like to see such contracts much more often and much more in volume. This is probably one of the reasons why the production of artillery ammunition at Rheinmetall was already 100% booked up for 2024 before the end of 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is likely a lack of materials that are important for the production of the shells. On the one hand, there was a lack of essential explosives, and on the other hand, there was a lack of powder and linters.</p>\n\n<p>For the first two problems, the plan was to expand existing production facilities in Germany and build new factories, but local politics have so far prevented this from happening. As far as I know, a solution is not yet in sight.</p>\n\n<p>The latter problem lies with China. According to industry information, almost all European ammunition producers have purchased cotton linters from China (as of November 2022).</p>\n\n<p>While a delivery took around 3 months before COVID-19, it now takes 6 to 9 months or doesn&#39;t take place at all. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find any more up-to-date information on this, so I don&#39;t know what the current status is.</p>\n\n<p>What will 2024 and the further future bring?</p>\n\n<p>As already mentioned, Rheinmetall&#39;s production is already running at 100%. Around 200,000 shells will be delivered by Germany to Ukraine in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The German government has also awarded a contract to a French manufacturer, for example. The company is to supply 68,000 155 mm shells to Ukraine for 278 million euros. A further 282,000 shells are part of a framework agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no time frame has been specified, but it can be assumed that large quantities will be delivered this year.</p>\n\n<p>Further contracts for delivery to Ukraine have also already been awarded to Rheinmetall for the year 2025. A long-term supply is therefore guaranteed.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

That <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvZGaMt7UgQ\">famous Sprint video</a> is not showing you a plasma flow at all...</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Typos</p>\n</div>",
