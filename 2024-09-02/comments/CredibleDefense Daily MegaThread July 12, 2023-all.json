Everything I've heard is that Russian artillery from Feb 24 to the fall of Lysychansk was absolutely beyond anything since WW1. They went all out, expending tens of thousands of shells per day. I saw credible accounts of reinforcement units being completely wiped out by the day after they arrived. Ukraine at the time had little counterbattery capacity and no HIMARS to hit shell dumps. Truly a slaughterhouse.\n\nAnd then Russia began to realize it couldn't keep up their shell expenditure in the long term and began rationing it. Just a little at first, and then more and more. They're still dropping multiple times more shells than Ukraine is, but Ukraine will zap them if they get careless with shoot n scoot. It's a different ballgame now. And with CM shells I expect this to only improve.",

When it comes to re-entry vehicles North Korea seems to be pursuing a lower accuracy very draggy design which should make the TPS much simpler, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a Fanhui Shi Weixing style wood impregnated with resin heat shield proved sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, there&#39;s still a chance that North Korea is not able to strike a portion of the continental United States with a nuclear weapon, but I wouldn&#39;t bet San Diego or Los Angeles on it.</p>\n</div>",

The US should leverage its current stock and production capability of anti-ship and other missiles launched from aircraft, navy vessels and ground systems. Comparing this to the Chinese stock and their production rate, the US Navy should gain an overwhelming edge in this area by focusing on the development, production rate and deployment of advanced anti-ship missile and other strategic missile systems suitable for a future conflict with China. The party the runs out of missiles first, loses.\n\n2. **Naval Petroleum Reserve**: The US possesses the Naval Petroleum Reserve, which provides the ability to keep ships fueled in safe and hostile waters. Maintaining a secure and reliable fuel supply can ensure the sustained operational capability of US naval forces in a hot conflict. If it is achievable to protect that capability and at the same time severely deteriorate Chinese capabilities, it might be interesting to further research this avenue and develop adjacent capabilities and strategic options.\n\n3. **Personnel Quality and Institutional Change**: While concerns exist about the personnel quality within the US Navy, institutional change can be a more attainable option and a direct advantage compared to trying to match China's incredible naval shipbuilding capability. By addressing any shortcomings and implementing reforms, the US Navy should enhance its operational effectiveness of all naval vessels and deliver a competitive edge in a direct conflict. The big question is, how good are Chinese sailors?\n\n4. **Strategic Alliances**: The US should leverage its network of strategic alliances, such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other countries with shared security interests or production capabilities. Strengthening these partnerships can enhance collective defense capabilities and contribute to a more formidable force against China's naval forces. Or, piggyback on allied shipbuilding capabilities and churn out capable naval vessels which would otherwise would costs the US ages to built them by themselves.\n\n5. **Technological Superiority**: The US still possesses advanced technologies in not all, but various military domains. By investing more in these cutting-edge capabilities such as cyber warfare, electronic warfare, artificial intelligence, and space-based systems, the US Navy can maintain a technological advantage, compensating for the disparity in shipbuilding capabilities and thus Chinese offensive and defensive capabilities and options.\n\n6. **Network-Centric Warfare**: Expanding upon the concept of network-centric warfare, the US Navy can maximize the effectiveness of its operations through the interconnectedness of communication systems, sensors, and intelligence capabilities as shown how incredible effective this is in Ukraine. This approach enables real-time data sharing, enhanced situational awareness, and coordinated actions, providing a force multiplier effect. I don't know how well versed the Chinese are in this area. But if there is an advantaged to be achieved, it looks like an attainable way to negate the obvious disparity in numbers of US Navy combat vessels versus those of the Chinese.\n\n7. **Asymmetric Tactics**: My personal favorite, the US Navy can and should employ asymmetric tactics that exploit China's weaknesses and vulnerabilities mercilessly. This could be anything really, but as an example or two: utilizing stealth technology for a wide array of platforms, small and agile surface combatants, long range swarm tactics, simple barges that act a deeply stocked missile batteries, long-range precision strike capabilities to disrupt and overwhelm the adversary in key areas.",

Despite the fact that the 67th had a tank battalion in its order of battle I am not aware that they had ever received tanks before. The photo was posted by Alina Mykhailova, i.e. Dmytro Kotsiubailo's fianc\u00e9e before he, better known as Da Vinci, died in action near Bakhmut in March (the 67th Brigade was very active in covering the northern flank of the city west of Khromove together with the 3rd Battalion of the 92nd Brigade, and they did so extremely bravely, you may remember them for this famous [footage](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/12rpzee/ukrainian_soldiers_defending_last_road_to_bakhmut/)). \n\nAlina is sort of the Brigade's attach\u00e9 and follows it around. The entire 67th seems to be deployed in Kreminna nowadays, including \"Da Vinci\" Battalion, which some sources located in the Velyka Novosilka sector during June. Side note, Ukraine in recent weeks has greatly reinforced the sector between Kreminna and Svatove: in addition to the 25th and 95th Brigades fighting there for many months along with quite a lot of National Guard units (including brigades from the Offensive Guard), the 58th Brigade was deployed in April and now the 63rd and 67th as well; among the new ones there are the 42nd, the 21st (perhaps) and the 32nd. This last brigade is a bit of a puzzle. It had been proven to be training with Bradleys. It has now been geolocated near Svatove, giving support to the excellent 92nd Brigade. Last month some pro-Russian pages had posted a photo with the 32nd Brigade patch near a fallen Ukrainian reporting it was in the Zaporizhzhia region but their presence there was never confirmed. For [David Axe](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/07/05/the-ukrainian-army-apparently-downgraded-its-new-32nd-brigade-and-deployed-it-somewhere-quiet/?sh=62086235185f) they have now been equipped with T-64BVs and M113s, thus becoming a kind of second-class formation for mostly defensive roles.\n\nLet's get to the point: what about the 47th Brigade's tank unit? The consensus has always been that the Leopard 2A6s deployed between Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne were provided by the 33rd Brigade, which is thought of fielding both Leo 2A4 and 2A6. I did some digging and found out the obituary of a Ukrainian tank platoon commander of the 33rd Brigade, born in 2002, died in June 8. The ownership of Leopard 2A4s by this brigade had been confirmed. However, I wonder if it's possible that therefore 3 Leopards were under the command of such a young officer when the average age of tank crews is generally quite high. Maybe it is, I have no idea honestly. In any case, the only geolocated Leopard 2A4 loss shows it near Novopokrovka, in the same sector but not in the direction of the 47th Brigade's attack. \n\nIn the area between Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne, in addition to Leopard 2A6s and Bradleys, losses of T-72M1s and T-64BVs have been recorded. The former are supposed to be from the 65th Brigade. The latter, I have no idea. If anyone has suggestions on the subject or else please tell us. In any case, especially at this stage, mixing Soviet tanks of different types in the same tank battalion cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe point is that I don't believe the 47th gave up its M-55s in favor of T-64/72s. This is my speculation, but I find more likely they may have done so for a squadron of Leopard 2A6s, formally forming the \"pureblood NATO brigade.\" Let's keep in mind that for David Axe, Leopard 2R mineclearing vehicles are owned by the 47th Brigade. My personal theory is that the actions in that area are almost exclusively the work of the 47th Brigade, with support from the 65th. Hence contradicting the consensus of a coordinated attack between the 47th and the 33rd Brigade, which would be active about ten kilometers further northeast. The alternative would be that the 47th was left without a tank unit but I consider this an unlikely hypothesis.\n\nLet's take into account that originally, before the leaks, it was said that the Leopard 2A5/6s were intended for a single tank battalion, I had read of the 1st Tank Brigade. The figure was perfect: 31, a standard Ukrainian tank battalion (18 Germany + 3 Portugal + 10 Sweden). In general, I would not take the leaks by the book because it seems that some equipment has been shuffled since then. For example the 21st Brigade which now is supposed to be the \"Swedish brigade\" with CV90s and maybe Strv 122s (Swedish Leopard 2A5) according to the leaks had T-64s and no modern IFVs. I recall it had been confirmed that Leopard 2A4s were also to equip a battalion of the 4th Tank Brigade. In any case, the Leopard 2A5/6s were instead split between different units.\n\nThe whole thing opens up another very important question, if it were confirmed that the 47th Brigade in addition to fielding 3 mechanized battalions equipped with a hundred Bradleys in total also has an oversized company of Leopard 2A6s... Why did this happen? I have full respect for this brigade, but it feels like that a little too much hype was done by Markus before he went into full cry baby mode yesterday against Shalamaha and for some reason they would have bewitched the Ukrainian command into giving up all the new modern shiny toys to them. Which would have been better divided among several brigades, including the veteran ones. Of course this is my theory, I may be wrong and I am curious to see whether or not it will be confirmed by the facts.",

For <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/07/05/the-ukrainian-army-apparently-downgraded-its-new-32nd-brigade-and-deployed-it-somewhere-quiet/?sh=62086235185f\">David Axe</a> they have now been equipped with T-64BVs and M113s, thus becoming a kind of second-class formation for mostly defensive roles.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s get to the point: what about the 47th Brigade&#39;s tank unit? The consensus has always been that the Leopard 2A6s deployed between Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne were provided by the 33rd Brigade, which is thought of fielding both Leo 2A4 and 2A6. I did some digging and found out the obituary of a Ukrainian tank platoon commander of the 33rd Brigade, born in 2002, died in June 8. The ownership of Leopard 2A4s by this brigade had been confirmed. However, I wonder if it&#39;s possible that therefore 3 Leopards were under the command of such a young officer when the average age of tank crews is generally quite high. Maybe it is, I have no idea honestly. In any case, the only geolocated Leopard 2A4 loss shows it near Novopokrovka, in the same sector but not in the direction of the 47th Brigade&#39;s attack. </p>\n\n<p>In the area between Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne, in addition to Leopard 2A6s and Bradleys, losses of T-72M1s and T-64BVs have been recorded. The former are supposed to be from the 65th Brigade. The latter, I have no idea. If anyone has suggestions on the subject or else please tell us. In any case, especially at this stage, mixing Soviet tanks of different types in the same tank battalion cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that I don&#39;t believe the 47th gave up its M-55s in favor of T-64/72s. This is my speculation, but I find more likely they may have done so for a squadron of Leopard 2A6s, formally forming the &quot;pureblood NATO brigade.&quot; Let&#39;s keep in mind that for David Axe, Leopard 2R mineclearing vehicles are owned by the 47th Brigade. My personal theory is that the actions in that area are almost exclusively the work of the 47th Brigade, with support from the 65th. Hence contradicting the consensus of a coordinated attack between the 47th and the 33rd Brigade, which would be active about ten kilometers further northeast. The alternative would be that the 47th was left without a tank unit but I consider this an unlikely hypothesis.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take into account that originally, before the leaks, it was said that the Leopard 2A5/6s were intended for a single tank battalion, I had read of the 1st Tank Brigade. The figure was perfect: 31, a standard Ukrainian tank battalion (18 Germany + 3 Portugal + 10 Sweden). In general, I would not take the leaks by the book because it seems that some equipment has been shuffled since then. For example the 21st Brigade which now is supposed to be the &quot;Swedish brigade&quot; with CV90s and maybe Strv 122s (Swedish Leopard 2A5) according to the leaks had T-64s and no modern IFVs. I recall it had been confirmed that Leopard 2A4s were also to equip a battalion of the 4th Tank Brigade. In any case, the Leopard 2A5/6s were instead split between different units.</p>\n\n<p>The whole thing opens up another very important question, if it were confirmed that the 47th Brigade in addition to fielding 3 mechanized battalions equipped with a hundred Bradleys in total also has an oversized company of Leopard 2A6s... Why did this happen? I have full respect for this brigade, but it feels like that a little too much hype was done by Markus before he went into full cry baby mode yesterday against Shalamaha and for some reason they would have bewitched the Ukrainian command into giving up all the new modern shiny toys to them. Which would have been better divided among several brigades, including the veteran ones. Of course this is my theory, I may be wrong and I am curious to see whether or not it will be confirmed by the facts.</p>\n</div>",

On a technical level it may have some flaws but it was nevertheless a good tank by the standards of the time. It was born unlucky because as u/Gecktron said the 1990s marked a huge reduction in the Italian Army's tank fleet and a change in doctrine. 40 years ago the Italian Army had 1800 MBTs (Leopard 1A2, M60A1, M47) and 4000 M113s. Already in the 1980s, Centauro was developed and introduced with the aim to replace the M47s the motorized brigades in the Southern Italy still fielded. Then after the end of the Cold War almost the entirety of the armoured and mechanized brigades garrisoned in Northern Italy were disbanded, or reformed as cavalry or air assault brigades as the focus moved towards light and specialized infantry, and in parallel with the introduction of the Centauro the Army's requirement for tanks collapsed.\n\nAriete was introduced in the early 2000s, years later than planned. Due to cuts and the poor regard of the armoured component it had never received upgrades before now. Of the original 7/800 units planned only 200 were built, and it never found a market abroad. As I mentioned above, the Army since the 1990s has begun to look to the French model of wheeled vehicles (although not up to French extreme). Now the majority of mechanized brigades rely on a wheeled-only basis and don't have a tank battalion but a cavalry one with Centauro, which is also included in mountain or paratroopers brigades, and mechanized units have Freccia wheeled IFVs and Iveco LMVs. Overseas deployments in the theaters of operations this century have almost entirely relied on wheeled vehicles. Italy has developed excellent know-how in the field of wheeled vehicles but has lost the production lines of tracked ones, both the Ariete and the Dardo for 20 years. In recent years and especially after the invasion of Ukraine it was decided that a fourth tank regiment will be reactivated and the Army's requirements to be lifted from 200 to 250. As there are not enough Arietes and the production line closed, the Army is opting to acquire the Leopard 2A8, almost certainly produced domestically under license. The acquisition of about 600 tracked IFVs (probably Lynx) is also being considered, as tracked vehicles are making a comeback in doctrine and therefore investments will have to be made to improve capabilities in this regard.",

And because Ukraine is at war and not part of the EU almost everything also costs more. That&#39;s why there was so much discontent after their wages were slashed before they were raised back. (Even with all the outside help the country can&#39;t really afford the costs of its military.)</p>\n</div>",

There needs to be consistency in what you're saying. \n\nRUSI claims consumption this year so far has been ~20k a day (7 million per year). This is nearly thrice their estimate of yearly production. I fail to see how that is a low consumption rate - their remaining stockpiles are probably not in the tens of millions, so they really couldn't afford to fire more than 20k a day with a 2.5 million yearly production rate, or even 3.5 million. This war is likely to going last years.\n\n> This reminds me of your absolute obstinance when the Russian casualty figures came out in Feb/March. Being pro-Russian shouldn't mean being counterfactual. \n\nI must admit I've since soured on Milley's ability to remain factual due to his claim that Russia had around 1200 KIA in a single day near Bakhmut (which unsurprisingly turned out to be false - it would have shown up on Mediazona's data). That said, his 100k casualties estimate in early November has aged fairly well relative to later estimates from leaks - both the widely circulated one, and the 110k casualties by late February according to the FSB (which I consider credible because it was a secret assessment that was made to criticize official MoD estimates and therefore aimed for accuracy and not sycophancy, though it didn't seem to count LDPR, unlike US counts).\n\n> He was absolutely right.

It's stunning how accurate and prescient that analysis was.\n\nCome on, we can both differentiate correlation and causality. Radakin was right that Russia's ability to conduct successful offensive operations was strongly diminished, but was it *because* of a critical shortage of artillery ammunition, as he claimed? That's the part of his prediction that I criticized, not the broadly correct observation that Russia's offensive capabilities were limited. One can be right for the wrong reasons, in which case criticism of the flawed reasoning remains valid.\n\nSo we now know that, in December 2022, Russia still had at least 3.5 million shells available (4 million were fired between then and now, ~500k produced according to Radakin's estimate). In practice at least several million more, because there are no signs that Russia has run out or is about to run out, and to my knowledge no experts are making that claim.\n\nSo in mid December 2022, Russia for sure had enough shell to sustain high intensity fighting for 7 months, and appears to have enough for several more months at the very least (let's say 1 year in total). Is that how you would define \"critical ammunition shortage\"?\n\n> So, you think Russian sources are more credible. Got it.\n\nI said I disagree with one western official's claim that Russia is only able to replace 200 tanks a year. That doesn't mean I accept the Russian official claim that they will produce 1600 tanks this year - I don't think it is likely they will reach that figure, even counting refurbished or upgraded tanks.\n\nThe refutation of the claim that the Russian industry can only deliver 200 tanks a year isn't primarily based upon any Russian official's words, but visual evidence showing large amounts being delivered, perhaps close to that 200 figure already (I haven't actually counted, but one example of the type of footage I have in mind is Shoigu's visits of the Western and Central military district bases).\n\nThat said, I'll concede that it's possible that Radakin's point was misinterpreted and he meant newly produced tanks (i.e. T-90M), in which case 200 is within the range I would consider plausible.",

They weren't able to employ the ~40k shells/day that Western intelligence says they were using *just* in Sievierodonetsk, in Bakhmut. They weren't able to level Yakolivka the way they did Pisky. Their offensives in Vuhledar failed repeatedly because they, according to their own analysts like Rybar, didn't have the artillery firepower to push through. It's why they paid a high price for Pavlivka. Russian offensive power is a direct causation and correlation of Russian artillery spend. Period. So is Ukrainian, to be perfectly honest. \n\n\n>Is that how you would define \"critical ammunition shortage\"?\n\nLet me remind you what Kofman, Lee and other analysts have said many times. When Western officials make a claim that there are ammunition shortages, they do it from a standpoint of strategic reserves. For PGMs, as an example, NATO generals would freak if their stockpiles fell below 50%. They have much higher thresholds for inventory levels because of planning in the case of contingencies and emergencies. Especially as they rely on non-nuclear deterrence. Even today, despite being members of NATO, we are seeing many Western European nations struggling with getting over this mental hurdle because they fear being unprepared. Why? Because in democratic systems, you are encouraged to be risk averse. \n\nRussian generals and Putin are far more comfortable with letting PGM stocks fall well below what Western military planners would think is \"dangerously low\", because they are, at this point, entirely reliant on the nuclear deterrent. It's why they've pulled reserves from Kaliningrad and from the far east. What would happen if conflict were to break out in the Kuril Islands? What would happen if China were to push their claim for Vladivostok? These are obviously low probability events, but military planners aren't paid to be prepared just for high-probability events. \n\nSo, is it fair to say having ~5-7mm shells in your entire inventory, as an artillery led military, defending the largest square footage of any nation in the world, facing a \"hostile NATO\" at its borders, going into 2023, was a \"critical shortage\"? Especially as your stated aim is to reclaim the rest of the Donbas? I mean, the answer is so resoundingly yes, that I find it nothing short of unbelievable that you would actually think otherwise.",

They have much higher thresholds for inventory levels because of planning in the case of contingencies and emergencies. Especially as they rely on non-nuclear deterrence. Even today, despite being members of NATO, we are seeing many Western European nations struggling with getting over this mental hurdle because they fear being unprepared. Why? Because in democratic systems, you are encouraged to be risk averse. </p>\n\n<p>Russian generals and Putin are far more comfortable with letting PGM stocks fall well below what Western military planners would think is &quot;dangerously low&quot;, because they are, at this point, entirely reliant on the nuclear deterrent. It&#39;s why they&#39;ve pulled reserves from Kaliningrad and from the far east. What would happen if conflict were to break out in the Kuril Islands? What would happen if China were to push their claim for Vladivostok? These are obviously low probability events, but military planners aren&#39;t paid to be prepared just for high-probability events. </p>\n\n<p>So, is it fair to say having ~5-7mm shells in your entire inventory, as an artillery led military, defending the largest square footage of any nation in the world, facing a &quot;hostile NATO&quot; at its borders, going into 2023, was a &quot;critical shortage&quot;? Especially as your stated aim is to reclaim the rest of the Donbas? I mean, the answer is so resoundingly yes, that I find it nothing short of unbelievable that you would actually think otherwise.</p>\n</div>",

It also accounted for more than half of global LED production.[64] As of July 2023, China accounted for between 80%[65] to 95% of its production.[66]&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This stuff goes into our most advanced fighters, radar and thermal applications. Without these materials we can&#39;t produce anything anymore.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[What Mark Did Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s \u201cMutiny\u201d Leave on Public Opinion?](https://russiapost.info/society/mutiny)\n\nby Denis Volkov Director of the Levada Center (Moscow)\n\n*Based on end-of-June survey and focus group discussions, Denis Volkov writes that the prevailing opinion among Russians is that Prigozhin\u2019s \u201cmarch on Moscow\u201d has not weakened the authority of the central government and some believe it has even strengthened it.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... The causes and essence of the June 24th events can be debated for a long time, but their impact on public opinion is borne out quite clearly in the studies of the Levada Center. As luck would have it, the day of the rebellion came in the middle of our monthly six-day door-to-door survey, so you could see how moods changed day by day. An additional telephone survey and a couple of focus groups a few days after June 24 only confirmed our initial findings.\n\n...\n\nAccordingly, the rebellion had a very limited impact on the ratings of the authorities. This is confirmed by all available research. The ratings of Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Sergei Lavrov and the government as a whole have not changed. Only that of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the target of Prigozhin\u2019s criticism, suffered. Putin, from the point of view of the majority, did exactly what he was supposed to \u2013 he gave an address, showed his awareness of the situation, showed firmness, supported the military and condemned the rebels. The president did not win over his opponents, but it was enough for his supporters: \u201che did his part.\u201d Ordinary Russians had no issues with Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt should be noted that the president\u2019s words about Prigozhin, whom, however, as is his habit, Putin never mentioned by name, took aim at the key attributes of the image of Prigozhin as a \u201cpeople\u2019s general.\u201d The president seemed to be saying to his listeners: you thought Prigozhin was a patriot, but he turned out to be a traitor; you thought that he was looking for the truth and fighting corruption, but he turned out to be a typical embezzler of public funds. As a result, Prigozhin\u2019s reputation in the eyes of most Russians was destroyed, and thus a potential alternative to Vladimir Putin\u2019s power was eliminated.\n\nHere, parallels arise with how the authorities cracked down on politicians who challenged the president like Alexei Navalny, Sergei Furgal, Pavel Grudinin. Their discrediting in the eyes of ordinary people automatically boosted the president\u2019s rating, underlining the lack of alternatives to him. So it was this time as well.\r  \n\r  \nAs a result, today the prevailing opinion among the masses is that the failed rebellion had no effect on the authority of the central government. A third of the respondents do expect even greater consolidation of society and strengthening of the state \u2013 this is the opinion chiefly held by consistent supporters of the authorities. Meanwhile, younger Russians, who have long been more oppositional, are more likely to doubt that the government authority was unaffected; now they have only become firmer in their opinion. In addition, there are also doubts across sub-elite groups that are captured by the surveys \u2013 managers, entrepreneurs, the most educated.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://russiapost.info/society/mutiny\">What Mark Did Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s \u201cMutiny\u201d Leave on Public Opinion?</a></p>\n\n<p>by Denis Volkov Director of the Levada Center (Moscow)</p>\n\n<p><em>Based on end-of-June survey and focus group discussions, Denis Volkov writes that the prevailing opinion among Russians is that Prigozhin\u2019s \u201cmarch on Moscow\u201d has not weakened the authority of the central government and some believe it has even strengthened it.</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>... The causes and essence of the June 24th events can be debated for a long time, but their impact on public opinion is borne out quite clearly in the studies of the Levada Center. As luck would have it, the day of the rebellion came in the middle of our monthly six-day door-to-door survey, so you could see how moods changed day by day. An additional telephone survey and a couple of focus groups a few days after June 24 only confirmed our initial findings.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the rebellion had a very limited impact on the ratings of the authorities. This is confirmed by all available research. The ratings of Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Sergei Lavrov and the government as a whole have not changed. Only that of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the target of Prigozhin\u2019s criticism, suffered. Putin, from the point of view of the majority, did exactly what he was supposed to \u2013 he gave an address, showed his awareness of the situation, showed firmness, supported the military and condemned the rebels. The president did not win over his opponents, but it was enough for his supporters: \u201che did his part.\u201d Ordinary Russians had no issues with Vladimir Putin.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the president\u2019s words about Prigozhin, whom, however, as is his habit, Putin never mentioned by name, took aim at the key attributes of the image of Prigozhin as a \u201cpeople\u2019s general.\u201d The president seemed to be saying to his listeners: you thought Prigozhin was a patriot, but he turned out to be a traitor; you thought that he was looking for the truth and fighting corruption, but he turned out to be a typical embezzler of public funds. As a result, Prigozhin\u2019s reputation in the eyes of most Russians was destroyed, and thus a potential alternative to Vladimir Putin\u2019s power was eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>Here, parallels arise with how the authorities cracked down on politicians who challenged the president like Alexei Navalny, Sergei Furgal, Pavel Grudinin. Their discrediting in the eyes of ordinary people automatically boosted the president\u2019s rating, underlining the lack of alternatives to him. So it was this time as well.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, today the prevailing opinion among the masses is that the failed rebellion had no effect on the authority of the central government. A third of the respondents do expect even greater consolidation of society and strengthening of the state \u2013 this is the opinion chiefly held by consistent supporters of the authorities. Meanwhile, younger Russians, who have long been more oppositional, are more likely to doubt that the government authority was unaffected; now they have only become firmer in their opinion. In addition, there are also doubts across sub-elite groups that are captured by the surveys \u2013 managers, entrepreneurs, the most educated. This means that some part of the Russian elite must feel the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent trips to the regions \u2013 when he, violating all the quarantine norms instituted by the Kremlin, went to talk with residents of Derbent \u2013 were done for them. To all the skeptics, the footage of the jubilant crowd should have sent a clear signal: Are you still in doubt who the people support? Think again!</p>\n</div>",

The latter is answering from the perspective of someone who has had no capacity to influence these decisions, ever, and has to make the best of it.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why extraordinarily similar results translate in wildly different practical outcomes in different societies. E.g. the support that the general public expressed for military conscription in post-Soviet Russia was generally pretty high, except for a few years of Chechnya scare; but for most of the 1990s and early 00s, it did not translate in correspondingly low levels of draft dodging and military discipline.</p>\n</div>",

Though considering how pro-Ukraine this sub is, you pissed in a lot of Cheerios this morning.\n\nThat said, I don't really agree with this:\n\n>The wester allies have to put together a training program to start bringing up the Ukrainians to the level of professionals.\n\nI don't think NATO training is capable of creating a professional Ukraine force. Only Ukraine is and they aren't taking the steps necessary.\n\nNATO training can be broken down in specialist training on NATO equipment, the equivalent of enlisted infantry basic training, and mechanized combined arms collective training up to the battalion level.\n\nThe special equipment training they're giving is notoriously short. Likely not NATO wanted, and there are no credible individuals in any professional military who think cutting down on training is a good idea. While it's possible to get junior enlisted schooled up on brand new system that's notoriously complicated to a proficient manner in 3-5 weeks, that don't be the same for NCOs* and especially officers**, who are supposed to be the subject matter experts for any vehicle or other system but won't be after only a few weeks, nothing more sophisticated of training than the privates got. There have also been issues where training, field, and technical manuals haven't been translated, and without them...things can get bad.\n\nOnly designed to mass produce infantry riflemen (junior enlisted), the US Army, British, Germans, and Polles are running a minimalist 5 week basic training course to teach only the most bare bones of mostly dismounted infantry combat in a period too short to even do a proper montage in a movie. Basic training doesn't just provide tactical and technical proficiency (which can't be drilled heavily in five weeks), but also immersion into military life (especially hardship), discipline/obedience to orders, and the big one nobody seems to be talking about, the absolute essential to be in top physical shape, which can't be achieved in five weeks unless they all show up already in top physical shape (which they aren't). \n\nWorse, they're not teaching the Ukrainians'how they'll fight in Ukraine using TTPs coming right from the war, each different NATO partner running their own training program is teaching a simplified bread and butter version of their own doctrine, literally right out of their manuals. \n\nIn terms of combined arms training, only the US Army is doing it, its also only five weeks long, and it's being run by the Army National Guard from infantry BCTs (not armored BCTs). They've standardized the use of Bradleys for mech infantry training, which is problematic since only the UAF 47th Brigade will have those, which means it will be a near total waste of time for each battalion rotating through for five weeks to bother training crews. That means they're either wasting a lot of time or more likely US troops are crewing the vehicles and the Ukrainians are only acting as dismounts. \n\nAll told, I'd judge NATO training to be \"better than nothing,\" which seems to be the real standard to which it should be judged. If NATO hadn't volunteered, it's likely the UAF wouldn't do it. \n\nWhy can't the training time be lengthened? I think it's not up to NATO, they're stuck with ridiculously short periods because that's the UAF's policy. Former professional western soldiers acting as contracted trainers inside Ukraine for a year plus have said, like [here](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/time-is-not-on-kyivs-side-training-weapons-and-attrition-in-ukraine/) and [here](https://warontherocks.com/2023/06/what-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-need-to-do-to-win/), that the Ukrainians regularly cut training shorter when it's inside Ukraine, due to \"necessity\" to get them in combat ASAP. The UAF optemp is the reason, it's deliberately kept cranked up to the max, they aren't willing to slow it down to train. And that's likely an institutional/cultural issue among their Soviet era senior officers, who 1) Won't say no to their boss, like asking for more time to train 2) Believe training isn't that valuable to begin with. \n\nTo get professional, they'd need to lengthen the three NATO type training and make them tougher, more realistic to what they'd be facing in Ukraine. Most especially they'd need to address the problems you bring up too, they NEED to train their leaders better before sending them into combat. This isn't 1941, where anymore can say they are caught by surprise for a sudden war and don't have time. More so, this is 2023, we learned the lessons of WW2 and one of them was the absolute value of quality training. \n\n\n\n*Early pro-Ukraine talk during this war was that the UAF had developed a western style NCO corps that was professional, empowered, and respected. Numerous credible Western OSINT analysts (Hoffman, Watling, Lee)  have come out to say they did not. Some units pulled it off (seemed to be mostly SOF and Air Assault) while other units didn't. It's only gotten worse as the war progressed as they have no real NCO educational system, nor any standardized service wide understanding of what the NCOs are supposed to do. Western NCOs are leaders in their own right, Soviet type NCOs are helpers for officers, like foreman. Ukrainian NCOs seem to be the latter.\n\n**Like the Soviet Armed Forces predecessor and Russia now too, the UAF relies on its junior officers to do a lot of the work that is typically done by NCOs in western countries, to include training, acting as technical subject matter experts on systems, enforcing discipline, basic leadership, most planning, etc. This is especially problematic as junior officer replacements receive only 4-6 weeks of military training in total before arriving into their units. With a competent NCO corps including a senior NCO at the platoon level with the institutional agreed upon role to mentor and \"babysit\" the junior officers, that's less a problem.

Everyone remembers from July-Aug 22 when  Zelensky and others in his cabinet and govt talked up the Kherson attack but what they actually all focused on was a counteroffensive against the South, to reclaim\"the Coast.\" Their original strategy for the offensive wasn't just the Kherson bridgehead, they also intended a Tokmak axis too but they were dissuaded by the US who ran simulations and told them it wouldn't work. The September Kharkiv counteroffensive was an afterthought, they needed another big offensive because if there was only one the Russians could concentrate against it. Kharkiv was the supporting operation, Kherson was the main effort.\n\nThis year it seems the same thing happened, the two big drives are against Melitopol and Berdyansk to cut the land bridge, with Bakhmut being a supporting effort, mainly because it's working, they need headlines to show success (also why the Russians are counterattacking too). \n\nSo why? My \"assume the Ukrainians are smart\" guess is the Ukrainians are pursuing a military strategy to regain Crimea. \n\nThey want Crimea back because then the Russian blockade of the Black Sea is lessened. Without the ability to get maritime trade going again, Ukraine is screwed in the long term. If they can push the Russians out of Crimea they can establish their own naval presence there to try to secure the route to the Bosphorus Strait. To accomplish that they need to militarily take Crimea. To do that means entering it, which means Kherson oblast needs to be retaken. And for that to happen they need to come from either the northeast from Zaporizhzhia, cutting the Land Bridge, and/or a river crossing of the Dnieper in strength, which I'm pretty sure we'll see soon. \n\nMy \"assume the Ukrainians arent playing 4d chess\" guess is this entire war is run out of Zelensky's cabinet, their biggest strengths are an exceptional propaganda machine they need to feeding the beast for the support to keep coming in, so they need a major strategic victory this summer to sell. They're limited in ideas to 1) Cut the land bridge 2) Liberate major major of the Donbas. They might have thought the Russians were weak in Zaporizhzhia. That actually makes sense with all the comments from the White House/pentagon/State anonymously to the press and Zelensky too even, this offensive is going much slower than they thought. Since this is a very hard type of operation to perform, that means they overestimated their own abilities (\"We're basically NATO,, probably better at this point\"), and underestimated the Russians too. \n\nWouldn't be the first time in history that happened. It's actually the norm for why offensives fail. \n\n>So that leaves the question, what happens if the current offensive ends the same way as the Russian Winter Offensive, with few or any meaningful gains/change in the frontline?\n\nDepends on how they can sell it. If they don't make progress they can still try to talk up Russian losses, and considering that the US and UK are also routinely using high estimates of Russian losses and low estimates of Ukrainian, and how much the pro-Ukraine fanbase loves discussing dead Orcs, they might be able to articulate an attritional victory even if they fail in their primary obvious goal, which involved liberating territory.\n\nIf they don't make gains enough to sell it, that could be a problem. But I think the recent DPICM transfer was done to guarantee gains by fires alone. And maybe Biden will concede on ATACMS too. He's completely caught up with sunken cost fallacy too, he's got one year to get results before it's reelection season in force.\n\n>Btw, do you think that Russia's strategic bombing campaign with suicide drones, is mainly responsible for the success of the KA-52 strikes on Ukrainian armored columns near the front (causing much needed ADA and manpads to be diverted from the frontlines to the cities)?\n\nBased on what RUSI and the DOD leaks have said, probably yes. Russian strategic bombing campaign might not have even deliberately aimed at it, but similar to WW2 Allied bombing of Germany might have dramatically weakened the front lines by drawing air support and air defenses away to the cities.\n\nThen again, from my understanding, KA-52 have two ATGMs to choose from, one of them can track and fire beyond the range of nearly all MANPADS. To counter that, the Ukrainians would need legit mobile medium range, of the type they don't have and neither does NATO (we don't need them due to air superiority). \n\nWhat I think really explains it is the Russians used their attack helicopters correctly on the defensive for the first time and it drastically caught the Ukrainians off guard. Everyone wondered why Russian air didn't respond to the Kharkiv counteroffensive last September, because this is how rotary attack helicopters are supposed to do it. Nape of earth flying to launch ATGMs against armored columns, it's literally the chief role for what Apache and Alligator were both created to perform. It's actually pretty hard to counter as the aircraft can be pretty far away, mostly hidden too by the trees or terrain, minimal and inconsistent radar signature, and the counter requires radar guided air defenses at the forward positions, on active to prevent surprise attacks, which then makes them VERY exposed to HARM type missiles that the Russians have too.",

But the Ukrainian administration\u2019s public comments suggested otherwise. \n> \n> Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday that Ukraine has been hoping to receive a formal invitation to join NATO at the summit, even if membership, and the collective defensive commitments that come with it, would only be formalized after the war ends.

If they hear Ukraine react with disappointment, many will assume the aid package in question was small, or of at least debatable value. React in the opposite way and many will be reticent to send more. As someone else pointed out a few days ago, nobody gets rewarded for suffering in silence.</p>\n</div>",

A hundred Ukrainian soldiers die every day for that. Many more hundreds are getting wounded and deformed for life. God knows how many civilians die as a result of destroyed infrastructure, explosives, lack of medicine, lack of money for medicine, from stress and everything.\n\nThere is a considerable likelihood that Ukraine will never recover from this war.
