As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

            "body": ">The condoning or even excusing of large scale civilian casualties out of a basic assumption that one side is in the right is both partisan, and in extremely poor taste, as well as possible war crime denial. \n\nIt's not an assumption that one side is \"right\". You're incorrectly applying a strict legal term as a cudgel to win an argument by presenting the debate opponent as a monster, while being in a position where your interpretation of the sub's rules can quickly become partisan. Let's discuss it real quick.\n\nI have to make this clear. The laws of war don't prohibit strikes that cause civilian casualties, *so long as the strike has a \"proportional\" military value carried out in a way that \"distinguishes\" between military and civilian targets*. Let me quote an expert (former chief prosecutor of the ICC):\n\n>Under international humanitarian law and the Rome Statute, the death of civilians during an armed conflict, no matter how grave and regrettable, does not in itself constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law and the Rome Statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives, even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is **an intentional attack directed against civilians** (principle of **distinction**) (Article 8(2)(b)(i)) or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be **clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage** (principle of **proportionality**) (Article 8(2)(b)(iv).\n\nUntil evidence emerges that these strikes either willfully target civilians for no military gain, or that their impact is clearly disproportionately impactful against civilians, no war crime can be said to occur. None of us know the facts in this matter. We don't know the ratio of Hamas to civilian casualties so far, which prevents a judgment on proportionality. And since there are no military structures in Hamas, **every** strike **by necessity** is directed at a \"civilian structure\". Such is war when the enemy uses its populace as human shields. Thus the principle of distinction is currently impossible to prove as well.\n\nFurther quoting the expert:\n\n>The application of Article 8(2)(b)(iv) requires, inter alia, an assessment of: (a) the anticipated civilian damage or injury; (b) the anticipated military advantage; (c) and whether (a) was \"clearly excessive\" in relation to (b).\n\nIf you're aware of any of these pieces of information, then by all means share them. Until then, can you please remove the \"war crimes denial\" part of your argument? By the strictest definition, which is the **only** sort of definition law permits, **you don't know** if they're war crimes. Indeed, by accepting that framing of events without appropriate evidence, you're advancing a **partisan** narrative that comes directly from Hamas, to the benefit of Hamas. And more, due to the lack of evidence either way, it's **not credible**.\n\n>I would like to apologize.\n\nThat's great and I'm sure it's appreciated by the participants. But advancing the \"war crimes\" argument again is committing the same error you did in yesterday's thread. By every **credible** meaning of the phrase \"war crime\", it is inaccurate to apply it until independent investigations can establish it as true. And I feel your use of the \"war crimes\" rules clause is an effort to advance your own narrative (and by extension, Hamas's) on this subject, and prevent pushback against your argument by, frankly, hiding behind the mod shield.\n\nAfter all, you and other mods are the arbiters of the rules, and so you get to decide what a \"war crime denial\" is. But I hope you understand that, in the absence of **credible** authorities claiming this, you cannot reasonably enforce this in a way that *isn't* partisan.",

        "body": "There are more and more indications that most of the formations of the Central Military District are being moved to the Avdiivka sector.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago, Ukrainian military observer Mashovets was reporting the arrival of the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army (CMD) in the Novoselivka Druha area (northern flank of Avdiivka). At the same time, he wrote of the probable deployment of the 30th Motorized Brigade of the same army in the Volnovakha area.\n\nToday, many new Russian KIAs/MIAs were published on the \"Poisk in UA\" Russian Telegram channel and the first ones from Avdiivka are arriving. https://t. me/poisk_in_ua\n\nOn October 10, a Russian woman had spoken to her husband (a soldier of the 15th Motorized Brigade, the last of the three maneuver formations of the 2nd Army); he had stated that he was in the Svatove sector. On October 14, the man's fellow soldiers informed his wife that her husband had been killed during a combat operation in the direction of Avdiivka. \n\nWe don't know about the actual level of involvement in offensive operations of these brigades. For example, we reportedly know that a Storm Z detachment embedded in the 21st Motorized Brigade has been involved. Some mechanized elements may be partaking in the assaults, although for the Ukrainians their involvement is still limited.\n\nIdentifying the involvement of a given unit based on the gear deployed at this point of the war is difficult - we are no longer in March 2022: today many units have mixed MBT/IFV models. For instance we know BTR-82s are fielded by elements of the 2nd Army, but we don't know how many have been assigned to units of the 1st Corps. At the same time, I wonder if the T-80BVMs spotted during the assaults against Avdiivka belong to the 1st Corps or, more likely, to units of the Central MD, which had been confirmed to have received a batch of them.\n\nAnyway, the entire 2nd Army should be around Donetsk. But there are indications that elements of the 41st Army (CMD) are being deployed there too. A soldier from the 74th Motorized Brigade of this army was declared MIA on October 5 in the Pesky/Vodyane area, southern flank of Avdiivka. A few days ago [this post](https://nitter.net/NOELreports/status/1714903993204305951) was published, showing a soldier from the 1007th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army) complaining, stating that only 12 men from his company were left and they were deployed in the direction of Avdiivka. This may be a suggestion that the 55th Brigade is in the area. In early October a Russian milblogger had spoken of the deployment of these two brigades from the 41st Army to Kherson from Kreminna, but apparently they might... have stopped halfway. \n\nThe 2nd Army is not at 100% of its capabilities, having been heavily engaged, from July to September, in the battles in the area near Novojehorivka and Raihorodka, in the Svatove sector. Apparently the transfer of the entire army took place in the last 2 weeks. The 41st Army covers (covered?) the Kreminna sector and during the spring and summer was engaged in heavy battles there - the 90th Tank Division (41st Army) should still be in that sector. The 35th Motorized Brigade of the same army, on the other hand, completely disappeared from any radar during 2023. \n\nLet's have a recap of the formations deployed in the Avdiivka sector. On the Russian side, in addition to the formations from the Central MD (elements of the 2nd Army on the northern flank and of the 41st Army on the southern flank), on the southern flank there are the 9th Marine Brigade (no, it has nothing to do with the Russian Naval Infantry), the 1st Motorized Brigade, part of the 110th Motorized Brigade and the 111th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps along with the 1004th and 1487th Regiments of the Territorial Forces. The \"new\" 57th Motorized Regiment of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps would also being deployed in the area and in reserve there would be the 117th and 87th Motorized Regiments of the 1st Corps. Additional armored support is provided by the 504th Tank Regiment of the Territorial Forces - several MIAs from this unit have already been published. In the northern flank there are the 114th Motorized Brigade and the 277th Rifle Battalion of the 1st Corps, the \"Yugra\" Battalion and the 1454th Regiment of the Territorial Forces. There were also rumors of the presence of elements of the 106th VDV Division: unconfirmed for now, if that was the case I assume it's a small-sized unit as the division is very busy in Bakhmut. \n\nAs for the Ukrainians, on the southern flank there are the 53rd Mechanized Brigade, the 59th Motorized Brigade and elements of the 56th Motorized Brigade (the latter, I believe, came as reinforcements); the 3rd SOF Regiment, the Kyiv Police Regiment, several separate rifle battalions along with the 110th Mech Brigade are on the eastern flank; on the north-eastern flank there is the bulk of the 116th and 129th TDF Brigades as well as elements of the Presidential Brigade. There's also the 31st Mech Brigade (or, most probably, elements of it), it was likely in the rear of Avdiivka even before the offensive began, however. A few days ago the Russians had posted a video of a Leopard 2A5/6 claiming it was from the Avdiivka area. Initially I had thought it might be a Leo 2A5 from the 21st Mech Brigade, but apparently today Bradleys were spotted in the northern flank of Avdiivka. Someone mentioned the potential deployment of elements of the 47th Mech Brigade. Theoretically there could be another brigade that has received, for example, a battalion of Bradleys, so we still don't have definitive confirmation of the presence of the 47th. But apparently the soldier [the tweet](https://nitter.net/Danspiun/status/1716384974264205763) mentions is a soldier from the 47th Brigade. Until a while ago, part of the 47th was definitely around Robotyne and another part was being trained in the rear; the deployment of elements of this brigade to Avdiivka would be very strange in my opinion. A rotation of this brigade could have been needed, but to be deployed in a sector that has become as hot as Avdiivka right now is certainly an interesting thing. We'll see what's \"boiling in the pot\", when I have other news I'll keep you informed. Bradleys were spotted in action near Verbove a few days ago but there were unconfirmed rumours that the 71st Jager Brigade (which is active there) may have received them.\n\nIn any case, the Russians have been pouring far more reserves around Avdiivka to support the offensive of their 1st Corps than the Ukrainians have had to do (so far) to support their Avdiivka garrison. At the same time, the deployment of the bulk of the Central MD to Avdiivka could also mean that in the short term the Russians don't need large additional reserves in the Orikhiv sector - initially it was thought that the 41st Army was supposed to be deployed there in fact. At the moment, as far as I have been able to verify, it seems that the Russians are restaffing the units of the battered 42nd Motorized Division (58th Army) with \"wholesale\" manpower from the 1st and 2nd Corps and are deploying the 136th Motorized Brigade (58th Army) there, a fairly fresh formation. \n\nLet's recall that Mashovets wrote of three options for a Russian autumn/winter offensive: Kupyansk, Lyman and Avdiivka. I feel to rule out the second one, seeing how the Russian grouping in Kreminna has weakened. The first one is stalling, in the last week the Ukrainians have managed to halt the small Russian advances and even recover some ground, also thanks to the introduction of the Kraken Regiment in the sector. I'm personally convinced that the Russians will focus on Avdiivka, which is a city with a strong political value for them. Probably the original plan was to break through the Ukrainian first lines with elements of the 1st Corps and use those of the Central Military District as a second echelon to close the pincer around the city. The plan is going badly - the Ukrainians are truly doing their utmost best. But the Russian actions will hardly end here - realistically a very strong push will continue in the coming weeks, accompanied by massive artillery and FABs usage, with the aim of gradually gaining small positional gains and trying to create attrition among the Ukrainian garrison. I believe the battle will still be long.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There are more and more indications that most of the formations of the Central Military District are being moved to the Avdiivka sector.</p>\n\n<p>Almost two weeks ago, Ukrainian military observer Mashovets was reporting the arrival of the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army (CMD) in the Novoselivka Druha area (northern flank of Avdiivka). At the same time, he wrote of the probable deployment of the 30th Motorized Brigade of the same army in the Volnovakha area.</p>\n\n<p>Today, many new Russian KIAs/MIAs were published on the &quot;Poisk in UA&quot; Russian Telegram channel and the first ones from Avdiivka are arriving. <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/poisk_in_ua</p>\n\n<p>On October 10, a Russian woman had spoken to her husband (a soldier of the 15th Motorized Brigade, the last of the three maneuver formations of the 2nd Army); he had stated that he was in the Svatove sector. On October 14, the man&#39;s fellow soldiers informed his wife that her husband had been killed during a combat operation in the direction of Avdiivka. </p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t know about the actual level of involvement in offensive operations of these brigades. For example, we reportedly know that a Storm Z detachment embedded in the 21st Motorized Brigade has been involved. Some mechanized elements may be partaking in the assaults, although for the Ukrainians their involvement is still limited.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying the involvement of a given unit based on the gear deployed at this point of the war is difficult - we are no longer in March 2022: today many units have mixed MBT/IFV models. For instance we know BTR-82s are fielded by elements of the 2nd Army, but we don&#39;t know how many have been assigned to units of the 1st Corps. At the same time, I wonder if the T-80BVMs spotted during the assaults against Avdiivka belong to the 1st Corps or, more likely, to units of the Central MD, which had been confirmed to have received a batch of them.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the entire 2nd Army should be around Donetsk. But there are indications that elements of the 41st Army (CMD) are being deployed there too. A soldier from the 74th Motorized Brigade of this army was declared MIA on October 5 in the Pesky/Vodyane area, southern flank of Avdiivka. A few days ago <a href=\"https://nitter.net/NOELreports/status/1714903993204305951\">this post</a> was published, showing a soldier from the 1007th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army) complaining, stating that only 12 men from his company were left and they were deployed in the direction of Avdiivka. This may be a suggestion that the 55th Brigade is in the area. In early October a Russian milblogger had spoken of the deployment of these two brigades from the 41st Army to Kherson from Kreminna, but apparently they might... have stopped halfway. </p>\n\n<p>The 2nd Army is not at 100% of its capabilities, having been heavily engaged, from July to September, in the battles in the area near Novojehorivka and Raihorodka, in the Svatove sector. Apparently the transfer of the entire army took place in the last 2 weeks. The 41st Army covers (covered?) the Kreminna sector and during the spring and summer was engaged in heavy battles there - the 90th Tank Division (41st Army) should still be in that sector. The 35th Motorized Brigade of the same army, on the other hand, completely disappeared from any radar during 2023. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s have a recap of the formations deployed in the Avdiivka sector. On the Russian side, in addition to the formations from the Central MD (elements of the 2nd Army on the northern flank and of the 41st Army on the southern flank), on the southern flank there are the 9th Marine Brigade (no, it has nothing to do with the Russian Naval Infantry), the 1st Motorized Brigade, part of the 110th Motorized Brigade and the 111th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps along with the 1004th and 1487th Regiments of the Territorial Forces. The &quot;new&quot; 57th Motorized Regiment of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps would also being deployed in the area and in reserve there would be the 117th and 87th Motorized Regiments of the 1st Corps. Additional armored support is provided by the 504th Tank Regiment of the Territorial Forces - several MIAs from this unit have already been published. In the northern flank there are the 114th Motorized Brigade and the 277th Rifle Battalion of the 1st Corps, the &quot;Yugra&quot; Battalion and the 1454th Regiment of the Territorial Forces. There were also rumors of the presence of elements of the 106th VDV Division: unconfirmed for now, if that was the case I assume it&#39;s a small-sized unit as the division is very busy in Bakhmut. </p>\n\n<p>As for the Ukrainians, on the southern flank there are the 53rd Mechanized Brigade, the 59th Motorized Brigade and elements of the 56th Motorized Brigade (the latter, I believe, came as reinforcements); the 3rd SOF Regiment, the Kyiv Police Regiment, several separate rifle battalions along with the 110th Mech Brigade are on the eastern flank; on the north-eastern flank there is the bulk of the 116th and 129th TDF Brigades as well as elements of the Presidential Brigade. There&#39;s also the 31st Mech Brigade (or, most probably, elements of it), it was likely in the rear of Avdiivka even before the offensive began, however. A few days ago the Russians had posted a video of a Leopard 2A5/6 claiming it was from the Avdiivka area. Initially I had thought it might be a Leo 2A5 from the 21st Mech Brigade, but apparently today Bradleys were spotted in the northern flank of Avdiivka. Someone mentioned the potential deployment of elements of the 47th Mech Brigade. Theoretically there could be another brigade that has received, for example, a battalion of Bradleys, so we still don&#39;t have definitive confirmation of the presence of the 47th.

The 25th Army, once fully deployed (we are likely several weeks away from that, at least), will be the largest formation on the Svatove-Kreminna line and will join the 144th Motorized Division and (for the time being) the 90th Tank Division which are deployed in the Kreminna sector.\n>Just so we have a summary, what is the order of battle for 2nd and 41st Army?\n\n2nd Army: 15th, 21st and 30th Motorized Brigades, 385th Artillery Brigade + other support units. \n\n41st Army: 35th and 74th Motorized Brigades, 55th Mountain Brigade, 90th Tank Division, 120th Artillery Brigade + other support units. In theory it includes the 201st Military Base as well, elements of this formation were deployed in Ukraine but likely in form of reinforcements to other units of this army and not as a stand-alone formation, afaik.\n> My understanding is that LDPR elements were responsible for the initial attacks on Avdiivka. Is this still the case?\n\nYes, on the first day there were only brigades from the 1st Corps as far as I understood. Probably after the initial days there has been more and more involvement by elements of the Central Military District.",

Oleksandr Kamyshin, a hyperactive manager with a reformist pedigree, was appointed to head a beefed-up strategic-industries ministry. He has previously turned around the railways and has the confidence of the president\u2019s inner circle. Still more surprising is the recent appointment of Herman Smetanin, a little-known 31-year-old, to run the state defence consortium popularly known as Ukroboronprom. He is to sort out the sprawling, inefficient and notoriously corrupt company\u2014in wartime.\n\n> Mr Smetanin, a design engineer who rose from the shop floor to the director\u2019s office, is on one level uniquely qualified for the unenviable job. At the start of the war in February 2022 he was to be found in his native Kharkiv, 35km from the Russian border, as the director of its famed but faded tank factory. He lived in the factory through the terrifying first weeks, as bombs fell through its roofs, while a group of key workers continued production in breaks between the shelling. Every defence contract was eventually fulfilled. \u201cIf the mortars or artillery were landing near, you\u2019d wait half an hour before starting again,\u201d he recalls.\n\n> But there are questions about the possibility, and even the desirability, of turning around an umbrella organisation built on corruption and favour from its very early days. When the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, Ukraine inherited one of the world\u2019s largest military complexes: shipbuilding, tanks, aviation, missiles. Over the next two years Ukraine created three agencies that, with the help of poor and corrupt officers, siphoned off whatever they could on the black markets. Ukraine stopped making ammunition. Factories stood idle. The most advanced products were refashioned for the export market.\nIn 1996, with the government close to bankruptcy, the three agencies were taken over by a new enterprise with close connections to Russia\u2019s security services. (The two countries\u2019 defence industries were then closely integrated.) A successor structure came into existence in 2010. The new company, Ukroboronprom, was supposed to be about synergy, but in reality it was about personal enrichment. \u201cUkroboronprom was dead at birth,\u201d says a source who worked in the company at the time.\n\n>  When war came in 2014, and full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukroboronprom mobilised but struggled. There were notable successes, though. Perhaps half a dozen of what were over a hundred operating units were still able to produce competitive products. The Pavlohrad chemical plant, for instance, delivered gunpowder, a commodity most in demand in any war. The Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv produced Stugna anti-tank guided missiles that helped stop Russia\u2019s march on Kyiv, and the Neptune cruise missiles that famously sank Russia\u2019s Black Sea flagship, the Moskva.\nBut it has been private enterprise, independent of state-owned Ukroboronprom, that has set the pace in this war. Strike drones, the new addition to a conflict that otherwise often resembles the first world war, are almost all produced privately. The new drone entrepreneurs believe it is they who now represent the new face of Ukrainian defence innovation. \u201cI see it as my mission to resurrect previous glories,\u201d says Vitaliy Kolesnichenko, the director of AirLogix, a Kyiv-based drone developer.\nMaking Ukroboronprom exciting, well paid but less loss-making is one of the conundrums facing Mr Smetanin. He says his focus is on keeping things simple: increasing production, restructuring the business and tackling corruption. There is already progress on the first, he reports. Shell production is up by anything between 100% to 1,000% in the few months he has been in charge, depending on the precise type. Weapon production in every category is increasing, despite constant Russian attacks.\n\n> Reform of the governing structure will introduce new subholding clusters of companies, which will be organised around specialisation: armoured vehicles, aviation, shipbuilding and so on. The 34 of 66 units still organised as state companies will soon be turned into limited-liability companies or joint-stock companies with supervisory boards. Appointments of factory directors, a major source of corruption in the past, will henceforth be done by an independent commission.\n\n> A candid ministerial insider suggests that public-private partnership may be the only hope for Ukroboronprom and its team of young reformers. \u201cCan you turn around 60-odd underfunded, corrupt factories? I don\u2019t think so. But can you use them as platforms for private development? Maybe.\u201d A high-level government source agrees that Mr Smetanin will find the job of rescuing Ukraine\u2019s slumbering defence giant hard going. \u201cLogically, he has no hope. But we do live in a country called Ukraine, so he does have a chance.\u201d",

For the most part, however, the armed Lebanese group appears to have calculated that a wider war is not in their interest \u2014 as the US has hoped. But as expert Andreas Krieg noted, should Israel choose to launch a ground invasion of Gaza, that calculation could change quickly.*\n\n*\u201cThe self proclaimed Axis of Resistance [Hezbollah] has suggested that it will not allow for a ground invasion, and it seems the Americans have given the Israelis a green light to do ground invasion. So in light of this, Hezbollah can\u2019t really backtrack,\u201d said Krieg, senior lecturer at King\u2019s College London, and CEO of MENA analytica, a London-based strategic risk consultancy firm focusing on the wider Middle East region. (US President Joe Biden has publicly said it would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d for Israel to occupy Gaza but otherwise the White House has dodged the question of whether it would support an invasion.*\n\n*He added that if a conflict happens, and \u201cit\u2019s very likely that it comes, Hezbollah is recalculating its risks and its objectives, and I would say that anything that can be done remotely from Lebanon without Hezbollah fighters being put in harm\u2019s way and into combat is more likely.\u201d*\n\n*That would suggest Hezbollah could turn to artillery and missiles, but also to its extensive stockpile of unmanned systems, many purportedly from Iran.*\n\n*\u201cHezbollah drone technology is very sophisticated,\u201d he said. Krieg appear to diverge from Samaan\u2019s view that they could the drones would easily overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses, as Krieg said Jerusalem\u2019s counter-drone tech is \u201cfairly sophisticated and they have been preparing for this.\u201d*\n\n*Back in 2019, US military intelligence estimated [[PDF]](https://www.dia.mil/Portals/110/Images/News/Military_Powers_Publications/Iran_Military_Power_LR.pdf) that Hezbollah had up to 150,000 rockets, though it didn\u2019t offer a figure for unmanned systems. An [Israeli think tank estimated last year](https://israel-alma.org/2021/12/23/an-estimation-of-the-number-of-uavs-used-by-hezbollah-research-logic/) that Hezbollah had some 2,000 UAVs, mostly from Iran.*\n\n*Other than the munitions, rockets, artillery and missiles, Hezbollah has showed off drones during recurring military parades, including Mirsad-1 that reportedly has a 124-mile range; Ayoub, a Shahed-129 derivative of more than 1,000 mile range; and an access to Iranian-made drones, like Karrar, Mohajer and Sammad.*\n\n*The buildup, according to IISS research fellow Fabian Hinz, has taken place over the years to counter Israel\u2019s conventional air dominance.*\n\n*\u201cIsrael\u2019s biggest advantage for decades has been to have a highly sophisticated and unmatched air force in the region,\u201d he told Breaking Defense. \u201cBut now with drones, aerial assets can be owned by non-state actors that can be used for reconnaissance, precision strike, and with some systems in precision strike in the depth of the adversary.

        "body": " [Ukrainian spies with deep ties to CIA wage shadow war against Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/23/ukraine-cia-shadow-war-russia/)  \n> \n> KYIV \u2014 The cluttered car carrying a mother and her 12-year-old daughter seemed barely worth the attention of Russian security officials as it approached a border checkpoint. But the least conspicuous piece of luggage \u2014 a crate for a cat \u2014 was part of an elaborate, lethal plot. Ukrainian operatives had installed a hidden compartment in the pet carrier, according to security officials with knowledge of the operation, and used it to conceal components of a bomb.\n> \n> Four weeks later, the device detonated just outside Moscow in an SUV being driven by the daughter of a Russian nationalist who had urged his country to \u201ckill, kill, kill\u201d Ukrainians, an explosion signaling that the heart of Russia would not be spared the carnage of war.\n> \n> The operation was orchestrated by Ukraine\u2019s domestic security service, the SBU, according to officials who provided details, including the use of the pet crate, that have not been previously disclosed. The August 2022 attack is part of a raging shadow war in which Ukraine\u2019s spy services have also twice bombed the bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea, piloted drones into the roof of the Kremlin and blown holes in the hulls of Russian naval vessels in the Black Sea.\n> \n> These operations have been cast as extreme measures Ukraine was forced to adopt in response to Russia\u2019s invasion last year. In reality, they represent capabilities that Ukraine\u2019s spy agencies have developed over nearly a decade \u2014 since Russia first seized Ukrainian territory in 2014 \u2014 a period during which the services also forged deep new bonds with the CIA.\n>\n> The missions have involved elite teams of Ukrainian operatives drawn from directorates that were formed, trained and equipped in close partnership with the CIA, according to current and former Ukrainian and U.S. officials. Since 2015, the CIA has spent tens of millions of dollars to transform Ukraine\u2019s Soviet-formed services into potent allies against Moscow, officials said. The agency has provided Ukraine with advanced surveillance systems, trained recruits at sites in Ukraine as well as the United States, built new headquarters for departments in Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency, and shared intelligence on a scale that would have been unimaginable before Russia illegally annexed Crimea and fomented a separatist war in eastern Ukraine. The CIA maintains a significant presence in Kyiv, officials said.\n> \n> The extent of the CIA\u2019s involvement with Ukraine\u2019s security services has not previously been disclosed. U.S. intelligence officials stressed that the agency has had no involvement in targeted killing operations by Ukrainian agencies, and that its work has focused on bolstering those services\u2019 abilities to gather intelligence on a dangerous adversary. A senior intelligence official said that \u201cany potential operational concerns have been conveyed clearly to the Ukrainian services.\u201d\n> \n> Many of Ukraine\u2019s clandestine operations have had clear military objectives and contributed to the country\u2019s defense. The car bombing that killed Daria Dugina, however, underscored Ukraine\u2019s embrace of what officials in Kyiv refer to as \u201cliquidations\u201d as a weapon of war. Over the past 20 months, the SBU and its military counterpart, the GUR, have carried out dozens of assassinations against Russian officials in occupied territories, alleged Ukrainian collaborators, military officers behind the front lines and prominent war supporters deep inside Russia. Those killed include a former Russian submarine commander jogging in a park in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar and a militant blogger at a cafe in St. Petersburg, according to Ukrainian and Western officials.\n> \n> Ukraine\u2019s affinity for lethal operations has complicated its collaboration with the CIA, raising concerns about agency complicity and creating unease among some officials in Kyiv and Washington.  \n>\n> Even those who see such lethal missions as defensible in wartime question the utility of certain strikes and decisions that led to the targeting of civilians including Dugina or her father, Alexander Dugin \u2014 who officials acknowledge was the intended mark \u2014 rather than Russians more directly linked to the war.\n> \n> \u201cWe have too many enemies who are more important to neutralize,\u201d said a high-ranking Ukraine security official. \u201cPeople who launch missiles. People who committed atrocities in Bucha.\u201d Killing the daughter of a pro-war firebrand is \u201cvery cynical,\u201d the official said.\n> \n> Others cited broader concerns about Ukraine\u2019s cutthroat tactics that may seem justified now \u2014 especially against a country accused of widespread war atrocities \u2014 but could later prove difficult to rein in.\n> \n> \u201cWe are seeing the birth of a set of intelligence services that are like Mossad in the 1970s,\u201d said a former senior CIA official, referring to the Israeli spy service long accused of carrying out assassinations in other countries. Ukraine\u2019s proficiency at such operations \u201chas risks for Russia,\u201d the official said, \u201cbut it carries broader risks as well.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIf Ukraine\u2019s intelligence operations become even bolder \u2014 targeting Russians in third countries, for example \u2014 you could imagine how that might cause rifts with partners and come into serious tension with Ukraine\u2019s broader strategic goals,\u201d the official said.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/23/ukraine-cia-shadow-war-russia/\">Ukrainian spies with deep ties to CIA wage shadow war against Russia</a>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>KYIV \u2014 The cluttered car carrying a mother and her 12-year-old daughter seemed barely worth the attention of Russian security officials as it approached a border checkpoint. But the least conspicuous piece of luggage \u2014 a crate for a cat \u2014 was part of an elaborate, lethal plot. Ukrainian operatives had installed a hidden compartment in the pet carrier, according to security officials with knowledge of the operation, and used it to conceal components of a bomb.</p>\n\n<p>Four weeks later, the device detonated just outside Moscow in an SUV being driven by the daughter of a Russian nationalist who had urged his country to \u201ckill, kill, kill\u201d Ukrainians, an explosion signaling that the heart of Russia would not be spared the carnage of war.</p>\n\n<p>The operation was orchestrated by Ukraine\u2019s domestic security service, the SBU, according to officials who provided details, including the use of the pet crate, that have not been previously disclosed. The August 2022 attack is part of a raging shadow war in which Ukraine\u2019s spy services have also twice bombed the bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea, piloted drones into the roof of the Kremlin and blown holes in the hulls of Russian naval vessels in the Black Sea.</p>\n\n<p>These operations have been cast as extreme measures Ukraine was forced to adopt in response to Russia\u2019s invasion last year. In reality, they represent capabilities that Ukraine\u2019s spy agencies have developed over nearly a decade \u2014 since Russia first seized Ukrainian territory in 2014 \u2014 a period during which the services also forged deep new bonds with the CIA.</p>\n\n<p>The missions have involved elite teams of Ukrainian operatives drawn from directorates that were formed, trained and equipped in close partnership with the CIA, according to current and former Ukrainian and U.S. officials. Since 2015, the CIA has spent tens of millions of dollars to transform Ukraine\u2019s Soviet-formed services into potent allies against Moscow, officials said. The agency has provided Ukraine with advanced surveillance systems, trained recruits at sites in Ukraine as well as the United States, built new headquarters for departments in Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence agency, and shared intelligence on a scale that would have been unimaginable before Russia illegally annexed Crimea and fomented a separatist war in eastern Ukraine. The CIA maintains a significant presence in Kyiv, officials said.</p>\n\n<p>The extent of the CIA\u2019s involvement with Ukraine\u2019s security services has not previously been disclosed. U.S. intelligence officials stressed that the agency has had no involvement in targeted killing operations by Ukrainian agencies, and that its work has focused on bolstering those services\u2019 abilities to gather intelligence on a dangerous adversary. A senior intelligence official said that \u201cany potential operational concerns have been conveyed clearly to the Ukrainian services.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Many of Ukraine\u2019s clandestine operations have had clear military objectives and contributed to the country\u2019s defense. The car bombing that killed Daria Dugina, however, underscored Ukraine\u2019s embrace of what officials in Kyiv refer to as \u201cliquidations\u201d as a weapon of war. Over the past 20 months, the SBU and its military counterpart, the GUR, have carried out dozens of assassinations against Russian officials in occupied territories, alleged Ukrainian collaborators, military officers behind the front lines and prominent war supporters deep inside Russia. Those killed include a former Russian submarine commander jogging in a park in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar and a militant blogger at a cafe in St. Petersburg, according to Ukrainian and Western officials.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s affinity for lethal operations has complicated its collaboration with the CIA, raising concerns about agency complicity and creating unease among some officials in Kyiv and Washington.  </p>\n\n<p>Even those who see such lethal missions as defensible in wartime question the utility of certain strikes and decisions that led to the targeting of civilians including Dugina or her father, Alexander Dugin \u2014 who officials acknowledge was the intended mark \u2014 rather than Russians more directly linked to the war.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have too many enemies who are more important to neutralize,\u201d said a high-ranking Ukraine security official. \u201cPeople who launch missiles. People who committed atrocities in Bucha.\u201d Killing the daughter of a pro-war firebrand is \u201cvery cynical,\u201d the official said.</p>\n\n<p>Others cited broader concerns about Ukraine\u2019s cutthroat tactics that may seem justified now \u2014 especially against a country accused of widespread war atrocities \u2014 but could later prove difficult to rein in.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are seeing the birth of a set of intelligence services that are like Mossad in the 1970s,\u201d said a former senior CIA official, referring to the Israeli spy service long accused of carrying out assassinations in other countries. Ukraine\u2019s proficiency at such operations \u201chas risks for Russia,\u201d the official said, \u201cbut it carries broader risks as well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf Ukraine\u2019s intelligence operations become even bolder \u2014 targeting Russians in third countries, for example \u2014 you could imagine how that might cause rifts with partners and come into serious tension with Ukraine\u2019s broader strategic goals,\u201d the official said. Among those goals is membership in NATO and the European Union.</p>\n\n<p>This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen current and former Ukrainian, U.S. and Western intelligence and security officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity citing security concerns as well as the sensitivity of the subject.

The SBU also began mounting sabotage operations and missions to capture separatist leaders and Ukrainian collaborators, some of whom were taken to secret detention sites.\n> \n> But the operations soon took a lethal turn. Over one three-year stretch, at least half a dozen Russian operatives, high-ranking separatist commanders or collaborators were killed in violence that was often attributed to internal score-settling but in reality was the work of the SBU, Ukraine officials said.  \n> \n> Among those killed was Yevgeny Zhilin, the leader of a pro-Russian militant group in eastern Ukraine, who was gunned down in 2016 in a Moscow restaurant.

Shouldn&#39;t Russia have completely overrun Ukraine by now? How many Ukrainian losses will it take for Russia to win, 1 million, 10 million? Isn&#39;t 1 million (or 10 million) practically a genocide? Are 50K Russian casualties a good tradeoff relative to the number of Russians who were killed in the Donbas from 2014?</p>\n\n<p>Facts fall on deaf ears. You want to make them question themselves.</p>\n</div>",

[Based on historical experience](http://www.dupuyinstitute.org/blog/2022/06/06/wounded-to-killed-ratios-in-ukraine-in-2022/), total casualties are at least four times the number of dead, and a ratio of five or six is most likely.

Obviously an operator of the S-400 working in conjunction with the pilots of the F-35 could learn a significant amount about how best to operate the system to maximise your chances of detecting the aircraft, but whilst Turkiye would no doubt do that (indeed would no doubt be **asked to do that** so that other F-35 operators could better understand the danger) I don't see any reason whatsoever to believe they would share the information with Russia - there is, after all, a good reason that Turkiye is in NATO. If the operation of both systems were legitimately a risk then I assume something like the following must be the concern:\n\n1. The S-400 actually transmits data it collects to its makers somehow. That's the notion that best reflects the White House statement but it seems pretty absurd to me - surely the Turks would be monitoring the equipment for anything like that? \n2. Technicians servicing the S-400 will somehow steal data it's collected. Again, surely they're not just being handed the keys and left to get on with it..._particularly_ not for the sets involved in testing with the F-35. Alright maybe they'd be less vigilant with sets that aren't involved in specialist testing but what's the advantage of seeing any data they gather - it's not like S-400s aren't going to see F-35s flying around at some point anyway, they've likely already had a sniff at Royal Air Force jets in Syria. \n3. ????\n\nSo yeah.
