        "body": "*Ukraine Faces Shortfall in Weapons as It Gears Up for First Major Counteroffensive. Western weapons have helped Ukraine claw back territory in the south, but Kyiv will need greater range and numbers of arms to succeed. \u2018We\u2019ve lost so many tanks.\u2019*\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-faces-shortfall-in-weapons-as-it-gears-up-for-first-major-counteroffensive-11658398142\n\nBy Vivian Salama July 21, 2022 6:09 am ET\n\nKOCHUBEIVKA, Ukraine\u2014Along the sprawling fields of sunflowers, wheat and watermelon in southern Ukraine, fighters are preparing for their first major offensive to recapture territory seized by Russian forces earlier this year.\n\nThis month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered a new offensive along the southern front to reclaim regions near or along the Black Sea coast that are critical to the country\u2019s security and economy.\n\nThe order followed the delivery of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or Himars, by the U.S. last month. Those arms, which strike targets from longer distances and are easy to move and very powerful, have already allowed Ukrainian forces to claw back some territory, say soldiers along the front line.\n\nBut the Russians\u2019 ability to strike at the south from land, air and sea means Ukrainian forces need a far greater number and range of weapons from the West, including drones, artillery, tanks and armored vehicles, if Kyiv hopes to regain an area that is indispensable to any future settlement of the war, say Ukrainian commanders and soldiers fighting there.\n\n\nRussian shelling sends up smoke from an area of the Kherson region regained by Ukrainian forces.\n\u201cFor two months, we didn\u2019t move from our trenches, trying our best not to allow Russians to advance while living without showers or shelter in open terrain,\u201d said Aleksandr Patrachenko, a machine-gunner fighting in the Kherson region. \u201cThe Himars have made a difference. But we\u2019ve lost so many tanks.\u201d\n\nSince early March, Russia has been able to capture virtually uninterrupted territory\u2014dubbed a land bridge\u2014stretching from the eastern Donetsk region, including the port city of Mariupol, through the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.\n\nWhile the strategic southwestern port city of Odessa has remained under Ukrainian control, preventing Russia from dominating the entire coastline, the region around the city still endures frequent shelling from Russian long-range missiles, as do major urban centers such as Mykolaiv. Russia had already annexed the Crimean Peninsula in the south in 2014.\n\nBy pushing Russian forces back in the regions of Kherson and Mykolaiv, where some of the fiercest fighting is currently under way, Ukrainian forces hope they will be able to loosen Russia\u2019s grip on the south.\n\nEven with the support of the Western weapons, the advances have been hard fought. In the village of Potiomkine late last month, Russian forces fired some 800 rounds on Ukrainian battalions, which found little cover in the open fields from heavy Russian bombardment, according to one of the commanders. Ukrainian forces managed to liberate the village with the help of the Himars, but many soldiers were killed in battle and vital weapons destroyed.\n\n\u201cIt was hell over here,\u201d said Serhiy Shatalov, 29, the commander of the offensive. \u201cNow, it\u2019s like paradise. Super quiet. Everything changed when we got the Himars.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Pentagon said that Ukrainian forces killed a Russian commander in the Kherson region after using one of their new Himars to strike a Russian command center. Russian authorities also confirmed Tuesday that the Antonivsky Bridge in the region of Kherson was damaged with Himars. The bridge is a key supply line for Russian forces in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions and the city of Kryvyi Rih.\n\nSerhiy Shatalov, a commander in Ukraine\u2019s fight to reclaim the south, says U.S.-provided rocket systems have bolstered the counteroffensive.\n\nA footbridge in the Dnipropetrovsk region replaces a crossing destroyed by Ukrainian forces in March to prevent Russian advances.\nAs part of the new offensive ordered by Mr. Zelensky, Ukrainian military officials said that operations were under way to liberate the towns of Nova Kakhovka and Arkhanhel\u2019s\u2019ke. If those missions are successful, Ukrainian forces will use their new long-range systems to start taking aim at Russian military targets in Crimea as early as this fall, a senior Ukrainian military official said.\n\nHimars have been \u201ca game changer,\u201d said Ukraine\u2019s Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov in an interview.\n\nBut now, with only about a dozen Himars allocated to Ukraine, the need for longer-range weapons is growing as the war shifts primarily to an artillery battle. Some soldiers on the front line worry that between the lag time it takes to get the systems out to their remote positions, and the time they need to receive a crash course on their operations, it could be a while before the Himars yield more tangible results.\n\nFlames spread in Lymany, Mykolaiv region, after a missile strike.\n\nResidents of the Mykolaiv region continue to endure Russian shelling as Ukraine clings to the western portion of its Black Sea coast.\n\u201cIf you want to be successful here you need a lot of tanks and a lot of armored vehicles, because we\u2019re exposed,\u201d said Cmdr. Shatalov, who has trained with U.S. Marines in Quantico, Va. \u201cThe enemy also digs very good trenches so they can detect our positions [with drones] before we see them.\u201d\n\nIn early March, Ukrainian forces destroyed their own bridges over the Inhulets River to help them stall the rapid Russian advance in Kherson and Mykolaiv. They were able to recapture a number of villages at the time. But since then, many of those villages have continued to suffer incessant rocket barrages by the Russians, making it virtually impossible for Ukrainian forces to seize on their successes.\n\nLast month, in the nearby towns of Davydiv Brid and Velyka Oleksandrivka, Russian forces stopped the Ukrainian advance when they destroyed bridges.\n\nUkrainian soldier Pyotr Bilodid said more Western weaponry is needed to dislodge Russian forces in the south.\nHimars have \u201cbeen very successful in Kherson\u2014we feel it clearly,\u201d said Pyotr Bilodid, 32, a soldier at a checkpoint near the front line in Mykolaiv, where jasmine wildflowers line rows of destroyed homes and few signs of life are evident. \u201cBut we need more to break the land bridge.\u201d\n\nMany said that Russian forces have effectively used a combination of reconnaissance and kamikaze drones to spy on Ukrainian positions then hit them, often killing fighters and disabling their tanks. Mr. Reznikov said that while allies have provided drones to help in the fight, they haven\u2019t offered any anti-jamming software to prevent them from becoming disabled, something at which the Russians have proven themselves adept.\n\nDespite promises by various North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders to phase out Soviet-era weapons in favor of more modern NATO-grade weapons, many fighters on the southern front lines said that they still use predominantly Soviet weapons, including what they all described as \u201ctrophy weapons\u201d seized on the battlefield from retreating Russians.\n\nFighters in the area say that Russian forces are spread increasingly thin as Ukrainian firepower grows in intensity and range.\n\n\nLaundry belonging to a landmine-clearing squad hangs in the Kherson region.\n\nA member of the squad breaks for a haircut at the group\u2019s base.\nWhile Moscow in recent days has vowed to launch a new offensive, Russian forces have increasingly struggled to maintain offensive combat power, forcing them into a dilemma over whether to deploy reserves to the eastern Donbas region or defend against Ukrainian attacks in Kherson, according to U.S. and British intelligence officials.\n\nOn a recent day near the front line in Mykolaiv, a group of Ukrainian fighters smoked cigarettes at the base of a massive 2S19 Msta, a Soviet 152.4 mm self-propelled howitzer that they seized earlier this month.\n\nNone of the fighters in that unit had ever handled Western-made weapons and worried that the intensity of the battle would leave no time to train on new systems. The staggered deliveries of Western weapons and the time needed to train Ukrainian soldiers on their use has slowed the offense.\n\nAn artillery commander among the group, however, expressed confidence as he slapped the side of the Msta. \u201cIf we can handle this Russian s\u2014, using modern American weapons will be like riding a bike,\u201d he said.",

Artillery is usually within a few km of the front line. \n\n> Ukraine is controlling more territory than the recent reports suggest, but the howitzers will still be pretty close to the frontline.\n\nThis is possibly true as well. There has been a media blackout, so OSINT that would be reporting a change to the front line in the Kherson region are not. \n\n> Excalibur's range is longer than 40 km.\n\nWind. I'm not an artillery person, but I wouldn't be surprised if a good tail wind could give you an extra 2-4km. Maybe more. Maybe less. And it looks like Ukraine has a good tail wind in the Kherson region.\n\nA ballistic trajectory for a 155mm shell brings it to about 10km in peak altitude - which is about 35 thousand feet. Will take 2 minutes. The wind in the area between 10-30k feet is between 20-50knots. The shell will spend probably about 2 minutes in that altitude range. That extra wind has to give the shells a lot of extra range. Also, this pdf seems to have a lot of math that describes it, but at the end there is a chart the gives results.\n\nhttps://www.aimt.cz/index.php/aimt/article/download/1718/186",

Especially the ones further behind the frontlines might be missed.\n\n> Antonovsky Bridge looks like a Swiss cheese with a ton of holes. [...] Russian cameraman who was shooting the bridge, he definitely deserves a medal. He showed the results, so professionals who know how to destroy bridges were very happy to the the video, and see what was destroy and what wasn't destroyed, so our bridge destruction experts are delighted.\n\nI'm sure they have drone footage, but it's also really nice that we got such great close-ups.\n\n> They closed the bridge for checking and review, because you can't send military equipment over that.\n\n> This was not target practice, this was an actual attempt to hit it. Of course there's the railroad bridge, there's Nova Kahkovka bridge, but we showed that everything is reachable by our military.\n\n> The bridge is holding on. The problem is that you cannot use it in that condition. If there are two or three hits like that, the bridge will likely to cease operating entirely.\n\nWell, that's one estimate of the bridge damage. And repairing that while repair crews can be HIMARSed might not be quite that simple.\n\n> What about Nova Kakhovka bridge?\n\n> It's a little hard to destroy that bridge, but one can probably target everything that moves on the bridge, so we can make it more difficult, they'll have to move a single vehicle at time, late at night. We can make it a 50:50 proposition, driving through that bridge. Russian drivers, Russian logistics operators, it becomes the most dangerous profession, especially if you're guarding an ammo dump.\n\nRussian roulette, bridge edition. But it suggests what Ukraine could do if it had 50+ HIMARS. First on the list were ammo depots as it's one shot and it's done, but making bridges inoperable is another thing HIMARS could do, if they had enough.\n\n> At first we were hitting warehouses. Now we're hitting anti-air systems. That means the Russian group on the right bank (of Dnipro) is becoming softer and softer and softer. We're flipping it like a burger patty, and it's almost like a medium rare, and we're looking at where to bite it from.\n\nArestovych has been positively giddy since HIMARS arrived.\n\nBut it basically confirms that Ukraine isn't interested in heavy fighting for every village and town there, they want to degrade the occupying army until it's unable to sustain the occupation, just like the Northern front, or Snake Island.\n\nOverall it's one of more substantial episodes in a while, as things started happening again.",

Which back when there were 4 a single loss would have mattered a lot, but now that there&#39;s 20 it&#39;s believable that meaningful attrition won&#39;t happen, at least not before ammo issues start kicking in.</p>\n</div>",

Companies have accused each other of mislabeling their products to make them appear more advanced than they actually are.\"\n\nIn the end, not that surprising. China is a legit powerhouse and real big on industrial espionage. Also sanction effectiveness is limited, we know that.

Companies have accused each other of mislabeling their products to make them appear more advanced than they actually are.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In the end, not that surprising. China is a legit powerhouse and real big on industrial espionage. Also sanction effectiveness is limited, we know that. I don&#39;t think anyone expected China to stay stuck at 14nm, so the only thing surprising might be the speed of development.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s interesting they appear to have jumped the 10nm step.
