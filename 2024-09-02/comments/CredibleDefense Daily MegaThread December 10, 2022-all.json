If russia were to negotiate a deal, there is a decent chance that they could make lifting those sanctions part of the deal, assuming that what they were offering in return was considered worth it.\n\nHowever sanctions on military technology/advanced industrial technology I see being a lot more difficult to negotiate lifting. These sanctions directly affect the speed at which Russia can rebuild its armed forces without having nearly the same effect on the overall economy as energy sanctions. \n\nThat said, russia does get most of its money through energy sales, so lifting those would take nearly all the pressure off of their budget. I don't think the west particularly *likes* having these sanctions in place because its a difficult economy, but its also an opportunity to transition away from petrochemicals which makes future bargaining more in their favor.",

Oil, gas, fertilizer, agriculture adjacent sanctions are probably negotiable as they affect food prices and energy prices worldwide. If russia were to negotiate a deal, there is a decent chance that they could make lifting those sanctions part of the deal, assuming that what they were offering in return was considered worth it.</p>\n\n<p>However sanctions on military technology/advanced industrial technology I see being a lot more difficult to negotiate lifting. These sanctions directly affect the speed at which Russia can rebuild its armed forces without having nearly the same effect on the overall economy as energy sanctions. </p>\n\n<p>That said, russia does get most of its money through energy sales, so lifting those would take nearly all the pressure off of their budget. I don&#39;t think the west particularly <em>likes</em> having these sanctions in place because its a difficult economy, but its also an opportunity to transition away from petrochemicals which makes future bargaining more in their favor.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Like many commentators, I\u2019ve been dismayed at the lack of public protests and resistance in Russia, but on reflection I don\u2019t think we should be that surprised. We\u2019re dealing with an autocratic country that has eviscerated its civil society and deliberately [cut the heads off its tall poppies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome).\n\nMost crucially, this war is not viewed in Russia as a foreign adventure a la the USSR\u2019s war in Afghanistan, but as a war for survival of the national identity. Historically, countries fighting wars of national survival will sustain incredible casualties and damage before they surrender. In these comparative terms Russia has not sustained particularly large casualties yet \u2014 to give just one example. consider that it took approximately **8 million casualties** to force Germany to negotiating table in World War 1 when its population was half that of modern Russia\u2019s. Likewise, we are a very, very long way from seeing widespread starvation or societal collapse in Russia.\n\nOf course, times change \u2014 maybe we\u2019re all softer now, or maybe mass media changes things \u2014 but I think it\u2019s extremely unlikely that the war will end via mass popular uprising in Russia, unless it goes on for several more years, death tolls reach the several hundred thousand, and we start to see breakdown of logistics and malnutrition in Russia. Only at that point is it likely that the wider Russian public will be willing to sacrifice the defining national ideal of mighty Russia in the name of personal survival.\n\nWhat are the alternatives to this gruesome outcome? I don\u2019t think a compromise negotiated settlement or armistice looks particularly likely for reasons widely discussed here: both sides still have maximalist ambitions, and until one or both of them give these up (which would again require several times more casualties and suffering than either side has yet suffered) any armistice would merely serve as a prelude and breathing space for a continuation of the conflict.\n\nPerhaps an elite replacement in Russia \u2014 a stab in the back of Putin?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Like many commentators, I\u2019ve been dismayed at the lack of public protests and resistance in Russia, but on reflection I don\u2019t think we should be that surprised. We\u2019re dealing with an autocratic country that has eviscerated its civil society and deliberately <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome\">cut the heads off its tall poppies</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most crucially, this war is not viewed in Russia as a foreign adventure a la the USSR\u2019s war in Afghanistan, but as a war for survival of the national identity. Historically, countries fighting wars of national survival will sustain incredible casualties and damage before they surrender. In these comparative terms Russia has not sustained particularly large casualties yet \u2014 to give just one example. consider that it took approximately <strong>8 million casualties</strong> to force Germany to negotiating table in World War 1 when its population was half that of modern Russia\u2019s. Likewise, we are a very, very long way from seeing widespread starvation or societal collapse in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, times change \u2014 maybe we\u2019re all softer now, or maybe mass media changes things \u2014 but I think it\u2019s extremely unlikely that the war will end via mass popular uprising in Russia, unless it goes on for several more years, death tolls reach the several hundred thousand, and we start to see breakdown of logistics and malnutrition in Russia.

Hanko peninsula was rented for 30 years for establishing the naval base. All this significantly improved military and strategic position of the Soviet Union.

It was because of the lack of experienced commanders, lack of allotted forces, insufficient number of heavy guns and lack of winter uniforms. Even more difficult situation was to the north of Ladoga Lake. Attempts to attack in the deep snow on the narrow forest roads turned into encirclement of some formations of the Red Army. The success was achieved only in the polar region.   </p>\n\n<p>The consequence of the war was the deterioration of the international position of the USSR. It was excluded from the League of Nations, and the European countries and the U.S. began to supply arms to Finland. About 12,000 volunteers, mainly from Scandinavian countries, joined the Finnish armed forces. The British and French General Staffs planned to send an expeditionary corps to help the Finns through Norway and to bomb Baku oil fields by air.   </p>\n\n<p>During January 1940, the Soviet command pulled up the reserves, heavy artillery and other equipment. In February 11, 1940, Soviet troops launched a general assault on the Karelian Isthmus and by the end of the month broke through the Mannerheim Line. Recognizing the hopelessness of further resistance, the government of Finland proposed to begin negotiations, which ended in March 12, 1940 in Moscow.  </p>\n\n<p>The Isthmus of Karelia with Vyborg, the towns of Sortavala and Salla with the adjoining territory, parts of Rybachy and Sredny peninsulas, and a number of islands in the Gulf of Finland were ceded to the USSR. Hanko peninsula was rented for 30 years for establishing the naval base. All this significantly improved military and strategic position of the Soviet Union. In addition, the war revealed serious shortcomings in the training and equipment of the Red Army, which prompted the Soviet government to change the leadership of the People&#39;s Commissariat of Defense and began to reform and improve its armed forces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

At the end of the day, Russia can generate capabilities in-house, while Ukraine is dependent on Western partners just to stay afloat. Putin can choose to freeze the lines, stop attacking, and force Ukraine into risky counterattacks into mobilized troops. We\u2019ve seen multiple times just how easily those counterattacks can be blunted or even destroyed outright. And what happens once the lines are frozen, if the already waning Western aid packages start being totally insufficient? If Western aid slows to a trickle, how long will Ukrainians be thrown into frozen lines without supplies? Keep in mind it took 5 years from 2014 for a Russia dove like Zelensky to be elected as president, promising peace and Ukrainian compliance with the Minsk agreements.
