Ukrainian mobilization has brought back many retired Soviet-trained officers from Colonels all the way up to generals, and their performance has been far less effective. \n\n* The Ukrainian military right now is really two separate forces, one in which low-level officers are flexible and empowered to make decisions on the ground with mission command and the other is a rigid, top-down command from officers who don't have a good view of the battlefield. There's a growing feud between the two, but Soviet-trained officers are more prominent and numerous. \n\n* The Russian military has a similar dichotomy, but on a smaller scale. Kofman seems impressed by the flexibility and effectiveness of Wagner and some parts of the VDV. \n\n* Franz was impressed by Ukrainian junior officers and low-level soldiers, says they're innovative and can bring new capabilities to the battlefield quickly, but are held back by senior leadership who are far less effective and more rigid in their thinking. Ukrainian units are most effective at battalion level and below. \n\n* There's a huge difference in the capabilities and approach among Russian forces at Avdiivka, Bakhmut, and Kreminna versus anywhere else on the front. They are far more adaptive and effective, have better leadership and tactics. \n\n* **Kofman wanted to emphasize that despite what some people might claim, the Russian army is also flexible and has been developing new tactics**. Gave the example of using Lancet drones as counterbattery, which is quite effective, as well as Wagner assault group tactics and coordination. Konrad noted that most Russian innovation comes after getting whooped on the battlefield though. \n\n* On some parts of the front, Russia has significant advantage in fires and equipment, other areas are much closer to 1:1 however. \n\n* Wagner forces are far more effective than online propaganda claims. They have very differentiated units (assault, fire support, dedicated night fighting units, etc) and they've been quite successful. They coordinate well with VDV. \n\n* In places where Russian military is performing best, they are extremely effective: they set ambushes, innovative use of loitering munitions and drones, effective utilization of night fighting, etc. to take objectives. \n\n* Kofman and company learned a lot about the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of certain pgms while in country. Some are not nearly as effective as they should be for whatever reason. \n\n* There's been backsliding over the past 12 months in the Ukrainian military at the institutional level and it has real negative real world impacts on the war with generals in the rear telling people to hold trenches no matter what, even if flexibility would be much more effective (seems like a heavy hint that the static Bakhmut defense is a disaster). \n\n* There's a major lack of mine-clearing equipment on both sides, and it greatly increases costs for both on the offensive. This raises questions about Ukrainian effectiveness during upcoming offensive, was a major obstacle to them in Kherson for example. \n\n* Rob Lee and Kofman traveled into Bakhmut itself on their trip (based on comments sounds like Konrad and Franz got within artillery range, but didn't go to city proper). The trip into Bakhmut sounded like a harrowing experience for them, but Kofman claims they learned a lot they wouldnt have otherwise, calling it a calculated risk. Kofman wouldn't share all his insights however as the fight is still ongoing and he doesnt want to potentially hurt Ukrainian forces. Says Starlink is absolutely *essential* as a military technology for Ukraine. Bakhmut fighting is intense, thinks unlike everywhere else in Ukraine casualties from small arms is about equal to those from artillery in the battle. ATGMs are being used extensively to clear positions and AFVs engage enemy positions at extremely close range (note: weve seen video evidence of this). Effective use of snipers there as well. \n\n* Russia knows where all the best Ukrainian troops are across the entire front and they specifically target the weak points in the line like TDF. Are doing that locally in Bakhmut as well. \n\n* Conditions are hard in Bakhmut, Kofman is impressed it's still holding. Its being held by multiple brigades right now including TDF. Ukraine has less troops, artillery, and artillery ammo at Bakhmut. Their supply lines are in a bad state and tightly constrained. \n\n* **In Bakhmut the challenge Ukraine has is that they're having trouble fighting from fixed positions in unfavorable terrain as it doesn't play to any of their advantages.**\n\n* **Ukrainian defenses West of Bakhmut are very strong and well-emplaced, if Bakhmut falls it really wouldn't have a major effect.** Kofman thinks there's a sunk cost fallacy or political influence on the battle that is forcing Ukraine to fight well beyond when they should've pulled out. \n\n* Franz wanted to clarify that Ukrainian units can learn from their mistakes, but he's not sure yet if it will institutionally learn the lessons from battles like Bakhmut. He seemed pessimistic. \n\n* While they were at Bakhmut there were rumors on Twitter of Ukrainian forces pulling back. In fact they were strengthening positions instead. \n\n* They claimed to have learned a lot on the trip about previous operations, ongoing operations, future planning, and getting a clearer picture of the overall conflict. \n\n* Kofman says he's not sure if Ukraine will withdraw or counterattack at Bakhmut. Says he remains \"cautiously optimistic\" about the potential for Ukrainian offensive actions in the Spring and Summer, though he's more cognizant of the challenges Ukraine is facing and that his visit took some of the \"glean off aspects of the public image\" of the Ukrainian war effort. \n\n* Kofman is planning to do another 1-2 episodes based on their experiences in Ukraine, will also touch on Bakhmut more depending on how the battle proceeds over the coming week or two. \n\nApologies if I missed anything, I listened to the podcast while grocery shopping today and tried jotting down these notes while dodging other shoppers (but mostly getting in people's ways). Another super interesting conversation, with a lot to glean from what was and wasn't said.

Some are not nearly as effective as they should be for whatever reason.\n\nI am 90% certain that he is talking about Excaliburs. There are claims that Excaliburs in Ukraine don't perform well, allegedly:\n\n* 33% of Excaliburs don't deploy, they shoot the shell, but no impact is observed within 5 km of the target,\n* 33% miss by more than 7m (effectively target not destroyed),\n* 33% direct hit on target.\n\nReportedly, GMLRS (HIMARS) are much more reliable than Excals.\n\n---\n\nMy hunch is that issues with Excalibur are due to GPS jamming. Here is how Excalibur works:\n\n1. Excal is [fired almost vertically straight up](https://twitter.com/noclador/status/1579829870586396672), and its unguided [ballistic path is nowhere near its intended target](https://i.imgur.com/ush8658.png),\n2. at the apogee, Excal searches for a GPS signal,\n3. if it acquires a GPS signal, Excalibur deploys its canards and glides toward the target; if Excal fails to acquire a GPS signal, it does not deploy its canards, disables its fuze, and simply falls as a ballistic shell, landing 10+ km off from its intended target.\n\nThis means that if an Excal fails to acq a GPS signal, it self-disables its fuze to avoid unnecessary collateral damage (as it knows that its trajectory is completely off-target likely by tens of miles).\n\nGMLRS (HIMARS), on the other hand, works differently. Pre-launch, HIMARS tells GMLRS its exact position, altitude, and angle of launch. GMLRS then, from the first second of flight, uses its INS to guide its flight path toward the target ([example video of GMLRS changing trajectory immediately after launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrVwtlWs_q4)). During its flight, GMLRS attempts to get its current GPS coordinates. If GMLRS successfully acquires a GPS signal, it adjusts (resets) its INS with its true (GPS) position. However, if it fails to acquire a GPS signal, it does not disable itself and still tries to hit its target via INS. If GMLRS catches GPS later at any point during its flight, it uses that information to improve accuracy.\n\nAccuracy with no GPS signal:\n\n* GMLRS: 0.6 mils (approx 50m CEP at ~84 km),\n* Excalibur: 0 accuracy, shell disables itself, [lands somewhere in the field](https://twitter.com/TheDeadDistrict/status/1614117811881758720).\n\n---\n\nEdit: The high failure rate of Excalibur shells could be a Ukraine-specific issue, possibly because Ukraine's M777s lack digital FCS (incl. GPS).\n\nIf Ukraine's M777s were equipped with GPS systems, Excals might perform better. An Excal fired from a \"smart\" M777 (which has its FCS/GPS systems enabled) could work similarly to GMLRS, the shell would be provided with information about where the howitzer is, its exact fire angle, and so on. For example, see that [Sweden's Archers auto-program Excalibur its shells](https://twitter.com/noclador/status/1634644492560003074).\n\nEdit 2: [Further confirmation that it's Excaliburs](https://twitter.com/John_A_Ridge/status/1634668052527845378)",

The black line represents its ballistic trajectory, while the red line shows its trajectory when gliding on its wings/canards. The chart is roughly to scale: as you can see, if Excalibur fails to deploy, it will not reach its target, it won't even get close to it, making it completely pointless, this is why it automatically disables its fuse, as it may accidentally land on friendly forces instead.\n\nNote that HIMARS works the same way it uses its rocket to reach max altitude and then glides down on its small winglets ([see an example video: GMLRS adjust their trajectory to go almost vertical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrVwtlWs_q4)). \n\nWhy does Excalibur need to be fired almost vertically? It has to do with physics: it needs to reach maximum altitude, where the air is thinnest (less air resistance), essentially it initially trades its kinetic energy (speed) for potential energy (altitude). It's counterintuitive, but it's how physics/math is ...\n\nHIMARS operates similarly. It uses its rocket to reach maximum altitude and then glides down on its small winglets: see this example video - initially, GMLRS is launched at a lower angle of attack (a limitation of HIMARS design), but it immediately changes its trajectory to fly up, almost vertically (this again gives GMLRS max range).\n\n---\n\nMoreover, Excalibur's additional range of 15-20 kilometers (beyond that of regular artillery shells) is its most significant feature in Ukraine. UAF uses Excal shells to hit targets that would be out of reach of Ukraine's conventional artillery.",

The chart is roughly to scale: as you can see, if Excalibur fails to deploy, it will not reach its target, it won&#39;t even get close to it, making it completely pointless, this is why it automatically disables its fuse, as it may accidentally land on friendly forces instead.</p>\n\n<p>Note that HIMARS works the same way it uses its rocket to reach max altitude and then glides down on its small winglets (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrVwtlWs_q4\">see an example video: GMLRS adjust their trajectory to go almost vertical</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Why does Excalibur need to be fired almost vertically? It has to do with physics: it needs to reach maximum altitude, where the air is thinnest (less air resistance), essentially it initially trades its kinetic energy (speed) for potential energy (altitude). It&#39;s counterintuitive, but it&#39;s how physics/math is ...</p>\n\n<p>HIMARS operates similarly. It uses its rocket to reach maximum altitude and then glides down on its small winglets: see this example video - initially, GMLRS is launched at a lower angle of attack (a limitation of HIMARS design), but it immediately changes its trajectory to fly up, almost vertically (this again gives GMLRS max range).</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Moreover, Excalibur&#39;s additional range of 15-20 kilometers (beyond that of regular artillery shells) is its most significant feature in Ukraine. UAF uses Excal shells to hit targets that would be out of reach of Ukraine&#39;s conventional artillery.</p>\n</div>",

[For example, see page 2 of this PDF](http://www.imajteknik.net/uploads/sdn500-cd01.pdf).\n\n[Here's an enlarged chart](https://i.imgur.com/asd667Q.png). The chart shows that after 5 minutes, an INS will accumulate an error in its SEP (Spherical Error Probable, which is similar to CEP but in 3D) of approx. 45 meters. This means that the INS knows where it is, but it could be off by up to 45 meters in all 3D directions (x, y, z).\n\nHowever, notice that for example in the first 10-20 seconds SEP drift is absolutely negligible: 1-2 meters, even at 30 seconds it is likely less than 3 meters SEP.\n\n\nIn practice, 10-20 seconds after being fired by HIMARS, the GMLRS's INS can accurately resolve to within 1-2 meters, so it can adjust its trajectory so that it is 100% on target. However, over the course of the 3-minute flight, the INS gradually drifts, causing the GMLRS to lose accuracy.\n\nThis is where GPS comes into play:\n\nIf the GMLRS receives a GPS update during its flight, it can reset its INS to the correct position and achieve 100% accuracy once again (0 meter SEP), as if it had just been launched. Each time after a GPS update INS is accurate within 1-2 meters for 20 seconds, 4 meters for up to 50 seconds, 8 meters for up to 80 seconds, etc.\n\nFor example, if the GMLRS has been flying for 2 minutes and its SEP is off by 10 meters, a GPS update would enable it to adjust its INS to its exact/accurate GPS position, reducing its SEP to 0 meters. Although INS drift will resume over the remaining 1 minute of flight time, it will still be accurate up to 5 meters SEP. If the GMLRS receives another GPS update, say 30 seconds  before impact (2 min 30 sec into its flight), it can again reset its INS to achieve 1-2 meter SEP (1-2 meter CEP) at its impact.",

[Cause unspecified]](https://twitter.com/John_A_Ridge/status/1634668052527845378)*, since Taras is a high profile, I'm posting this as a separate comment.\n\n([my thoughts on Excaliburs in a prev. comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/11ojmcn/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_11_2023/jbukqap/))\n\n---\n\nAdditional thoughts: \n\nM1156 Precision Guidance Kit has a safety feature: *a fail-safe exists where if the shell does not impact within 150 m (490 ft) of the intended target, it will land but not explode; the PGK \"decides\" five seconds after launch whether it expects to impact close enough to detonate.*\n\nI'm additionally wondering whether Excals have a similar \"safety\" feature, but I wasn't able to confirm it. If they do, and an Excalibur shell gets GPS-jammed during the last part of its trajectory (15-20 secs before impact), it may interpret the absence of a GPS signal as a miss. Without the correct GPS coordinates, the shell cannot verify that it is within 150 meters of its target, causing it to disable its fuse and not detonate.\n\nFurthermore, there has been at least [one documented instance where a (presumed) Excalibur shell hit a Russian Tor, creating a large hole in it but not detonating](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1618397089167441923). That behavior would be consistent with the fail-safe mechanism: for most of its trajectory, that particular Excalibur shell correctly guided itself onto the Tor using GPS signals. However, at some point, the GPS signal may have become jammed (especially if the shell is flying toward Russians, it then naturally flies toward Russian GPS jammers, maybe 15 km from a jammer it GPS wasn't jammed sufficiently, but as it got closer jammer was able to overwhelm the sat signal), rendering the shell unable to determine its location. As a result, since the shell couldn't verify that it was within 150 m of its target, it disabled its fuze as a safety feature to avoid collateral damage (it did hit Tor, but did not detonate).",

                "body": "The 105 is inferior, and may have trouble with the T-72B3's armor suite, esp. with modern ERA. There is a reason why the west all moved over to the 120mm. Part of it was the greater capacity, the other half was the growing inferiority of the 105mm KE round. \n\nRegarding armor, the Leo1 is very inferior. IIRC its got an all-steel armor array. The complicating factor re: leo capabilities are all the upgrade packages, the Leo 1C2 is actually very good and *does* have composite add on armor (again IIRC) whereas the German A5 didn't. So another secret question is do the Ukrainians get Leo 1A2s, A5s, or are they upgraded to the C2 standard? Who knows. Regardless even the C2 isn't really up to modern standards. The Leo 1 will be penetrated by basically everything on the battlefield, it *may* be able to resist a BMP-2 from the front. Especially if they get modern armor upgrades. But even a T-62M will not struggle to pen a Leo1 from any angle. \n\nMobility wise, the Leo 1s are very mobile, very fast, and as I heard quite reliable. Theyre really a very good tank to use and operate, very versatile. The Leo1 also has a number of upgrade options that could make them quite modern re: FCS. C2s had Laser range finders, good NVGs, and Thermals. Of course some of the European Leos in long term storage may not have moved since the 1980s and so be quite primitive. Thankfully for the Ukrainians, the Leo1 was a ubiquitous design, it uses a very common gun caliber, and so spare parts and ammo should not be an issue. \n\nOverall, the Leo 1 (especially if upgraded) is more than a match for the T-62m, and would be comparable to a T-72 Ural. However more modern T-72s, especially those upgraded to the B3 standard, will likely either meet or outmatch the Leo1 in everything but reverse speed.",

                            "body": "Political reasons that come down to denying retreats because of political optics, polling, morale, and every other reason are the type of things that historians rip Hitler apart for rightfully. Why Stalin gets ripped apart for 1941. Why Churchill gets ripped apart for Singapore. Rightfully, because those were all terrible decisions regardless if they could try to justify them by saying \"politics forced it.\" They didn't, they don't. Those are excuses for bad decisions. \n\nAnd let's not forget that Ukrainians possess one of the greatest IO/propaganda arms in modern history. They have the ability to spin sht into gold and have everyone believe them no matter what they say. They could have retreated already and declared the campaign a total success stating that the entire objective was to delay the Russians and rack up the kill ratio that everyone can't stop creaming themselves about. And then BEFORE their position turned into a terrible one, they retreated. \n\nIf only there was a term for that...hmmm... defense in depth, that's it. If only there was a strategy that emphasized it... Wait, attrition. If only there was a tactical and operational level doctrine that the UAF already followed and want to perform that made it happen... Of wait, maneuver defense. But that's all nonsense, because retreat means defeat, and any defeat is unacceptable. \"Not a step back!\" That never fails. \n\nAlso, Bakhmut was never a \"key objective\" to take alone. Notice they're attacking Kupyansk, Kreminna, Avdiivka, etc too? None of those are independent operations done because someone saw a city on a map and said \"I want a victory, take it\" and did it first in Bakhmut and then just added cities. \n\nThose are locations that NEED to be taken in order to conquer the Donbas, which has been the chief Russian strategic objective for two weeks shy of a year.\n\nSloviansk is the JFO HQ, it's the chief fortress city of the Donbas. It's to the Donbas as to what Kyiv is to Ukraine. The Russians couldn't take it from the Izyum axis due to water obstacles northwest to northeast of the city. To the east to Siversk they couldn't assault the Donets river successfully. Especially after the loss of Izyum, there was ONE route left open to reach Sloviansk, through the Siversk-Bakhmut line. For whatever reason they prioritized Bakhmut, and now they've fully penetrated the Siversk-Bakhmut line at Bakhmut.\n\nThe next obstacle to reach Sloviansk is over a ridgeline to the west of Bakhmut.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Political reasons that come down to denying retreats because of political optics, polling, morale, and every other reason are the type of things that historians rip Hitler apart for rightfully. Why Stalin gets ripped apart for 1941. Why Churchill gets ripped apart for Singapore. Rightfully, because those were all terrible decisions regardless if they could try to justify them by saying &quot;politics forced it.&quot; They didn&#39;t, they don&#39;t. Those are excuses for bad decisions. </p>\n\n<p>And let&#39;s not forget that Ukrainians possess one of the greatest IO/propaganda arms in modern history. They have the ability to spin sht into gold and have everyone believe them no matter what they say. They could have retreated already and declared the campaign a total success stating that the entire objective was to delay the Russians and rack up the kill ratio that everyone can&#39;t stop creaming themselves about. And then BEFORE their position turned into a terrible one, they retreated. </p>\n\n<p>If only there was a term for that...hmmm... defense in depth, that&#39;s it. If only there was a strategy that emphasized it... Wait, attrition. If only there was a tactical and operational level doctrine that the UAF already followed and want to perform that made it happen... Of wait, maneuver defense. But that&#39;s all nonsense, because retreat means defeat, and any defeat is unacceptable. &quot;Not a step back!&quot; That never fails. </p>\n\n<p>Also, Bakhmut was never a &quot;key objective&quot; to take alone. Notice they&#39;re attacking Kupyansk, Kreminna, Avdiivka, etc too? None of those are independent operations done because someone saw a city on a map and said &quot;I want a victory, take it&quot; and did it first in Bakhmut and then just added cities. </p>\n\n<p>Those are locations that NEED to be taken in order to conquer the Donbas, which has been the chief Russian strategic objective for two weeks shy of a year.</p>\n\n<p>Sloviansk is the JFO HQ, it&#39;s the chief fortress city of the Donbas. It&#39;s to the Donbas as to what Kyiv is to Ukraine. The Russians couldn&#39;t take it from the Izyum axis due to water obstacles northwest to northeast of the city. To the east to Siversk they couldn&#39;t assault the Donets river successfully. Especially after the loss of Izyum, there was ONE route left open to reach Sloviansk, through the Siversk-Bakhmut line. For whatever reason they prioritized Bakhmut, and now they&#39;ve fully penetrated the Siversk-Bakhmut line at Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>The next obstacle to reach Sloviansk is over a ridgeline to the west of Bakhmut.

If that's what the losses are now, what about a hypothetical central Asian war 15 years from now?\n\nSo, the result is that you accept the massive losses, because most of your equipment is on the verge of being write offs anyways.

The Swiss parliamentary elections are this autumn.\n\n2. Judging by the comments underneath, it's clear that the underlying issue is (very) poorly understood. The opposition to the weapon transfers to the battlefield in Ukraine come from two Swiss political blocks: the far-right SVP and the left-wing social-democratic SP. The SVP is an isolationist and populist party completely in bed with (among others) the Swiss banking industry, I don't think I need to explain what their obvious motivations are. The SP, on the other hand, is a very \"red\" socialist party whose foreign policy positions are highly ideologically motivated. The SP despises the Swiss banks, and of course Putin too, but they also despise the Swiss armament industry. One of their main political discourse a few years back was that being neutral while selling weapons abroad is immoral and needs to be stopped, and that the armament industry is superfluous and evil to begin with. This came to a head in 2020 when the Swiss cabinet proposed to reform the Swiss legislation on weapons sales in such a way that it would give the executive the power to decide on a case-by-case basis when Swiss weapons could be exported. This caused an uproar within the left wing which threatened with a referendum if there weren't clear rules on when weapons exports would and wouldn't be allowed. And to be fair, the fact that there had been previous scandals where Swiss weapons ended up in conflicts where they shouldn't have been definitely did not speak in favor of increased opacity in this sector. In the end, the rules were changed in 2021 to only allow exports of Swiss weapons to non-conflict zones (which is a pretty standard clause btw, most countries have similar rules in place, which is why we haven't seen South Korean or Israeli weapons (or Brasilian Gepard ammo) in this conflict). The only exception allowed is for democratic countries fighting a defensive war, and where the UN security council (i.e. what is supposed to be the UN's highest body) has recognized the aggression to be a breach of international law. And then, not even a year later, guess wmat happens - a UN P5 member invades another country, exposing the obvious flaw in these new rules. And exporting Swiss weapons to a conflict zone suddenly becomes the *popular* mainstream opinion - something so unthinkable that absolutely nobody in Swiss politics, regardless of political leaning, anticipated this situation. Needless to say, the SP is extraordinarily embarassed about the situation. But the Swiss left is slated to lose seats in the coming elections, and the last thing they want is to ignite an inter-party division, or to look like wet noodles for caving in to outside pressure. Headlines and pictures in the media showing Swiss weapons being used in Ukraine would make the SP look incredibly dumb. So doubling down on their initial stance and ignoring the issue until after the election is their best (and selfish) political option. And if they can kill the Swiss armament industry with that decision, then that's even better (in their view).\n\n\nMy personnal opinion is that weapon exports have the best chances of being allowed at the very end of 2023, and the left will try to use the opportunity to not only send hardware in storage, but also to draw down as much from Switzerland's active military equipment as possible. And there's a good chance that they only consent to backfilling Western equipment instead of sending it directly.",

They appear to have less than 12 months of publication, and the headlines seem to be alarmist on every thing that they report on from covid to finance to the war in Ukraine. If you have time, look at their previous articles with your mum and see how their predictions panned out. Generally, they won't have a high level of accuracy. If their accuracy is poor previously, why would that change now?\n\n\n2. If we take the arguments presented to their logical conclusion, then all non nuclear states should follow the whims of nuclear states, and all non nuclear states should seek to become nuclear weapon states. This simply isn't true. The Soviets didn't nuke Afghanistan. The US didn't nuke Vietnam. The British didn't nuke Malaysia, etc. Ask your mum to be specific about what she would be willing to give up if Russia were looking to re-occupy Germany. Ask her if Germany should seek nuclear weapons to protect themselves against Russia.\n\n\nEdit: Sorry, I assumed that you were German, when it appears that you may be Swiss.

Should they demilitarise under the threat of Russian nukes?\n\n\nThe other thing that I didnt mention was to ask her to think about it from the Russian side. If the Russians escalated to nuclear war with the west, they would have to be literally suicidal. They would have to not care about the lives of their children, their grand kids, their favourite cousin or nephew.

Why haven't Stalin ceded that territory to Germany in exchange for peace?\n\nWas she as concerned about nuclear war when USSR invaded Afghanistan and the war wasn't going well for the Soviets? If USSR was unable to conquer Afghanistan they should have just nuked the world, right?\n\nI actually think that NATO/Biden are managing the nuclear escalation well, even if it comes at the expense of Ukraine. If they did not care about the possibility of Putin using nuclear weapons, they would have directed NATO forces to intervene in Ukraine a long time ago. However, they are using careful analysis/intelligence to assist Ukraine without risking a nuclear escalation. It is unlikely that Biden would be willing to endanger American cities by risking a Russian nuclear attack over some Donbas, which most Americans would not be able to locate on a map.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that the West cannot peacefully coexist with Russia once they withdraw their troops to their own country.",

If USSR was unable to conquer Afghanistan they should have just nuked the world, right?</p>\n\n<p>I actually think that NATO/Biden are managing the nuclear escalation well, even if it comes at the expense of Ukraine. If they did not care about the possibility of Putin using nuclear weapons, they would have directed NATO forces to intervene in Ukraine a long time ago. However, they are using careful analysis/intelligence to assist Ukraine without risking a nuclear escalation. It is unlikely that Biden would be willing to endanger American cities by risking a Russian nuclear attack over some Donbas, which most Americans would not be able to locate on a map.</p>\n\n<p>There is no reason to believe that the West cannot peacefully coexist with Russia once they withdraw their troops to their own country.</p>\n</div>",
