      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

        "body": "No ISW today, holidays and stuff, but instead some (new) articles dealing with the worker shortage in Russia.\n\n[Reuters: Russia short of around 4.8 million workers in 2023, crunch to persist - Izvestia, Dec 24, 2023](https://archive.is/4w4oD):\n\n> MOSCOW, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Russia was short of around 4.8 million workers in 2023 and the problem will remain acute in 2024, the Izvestia newspaper reported on Sunday, citing experts and research from the Russian Academy of Science's Institute of Economics.\n\n> Central Bank Governor **Elvira Nabiullina said last month that Russia's depleted labour force was causing acute labour shortages and threatening economic growth as Moscow pumps fiscal and physical resources into the military.**\n\n> Hundreds of thousands of Russians left the country following what the Kremlin calls its special military operation in Ukraine which began in February 2022, including highly-qualified IT specialists.\n\n> Those who took flight either disagreed with the war or feared being called up to fight in it.\n\n> The outflows intensified after President Vladimir Putin, who earlier this month lauded a historically low jobless rate of 2.9%, announced a partial military mobilisation of around 300,000 recruits in September 2022.\n\n> Putin has said he sees no need for a new wave of mobilisation for now.\n\n> Izvestia, citing the author of the research, Nikolai Akhapkin, said that labour shortages had sharply increased in 2022 and 2023. It said that drivers and shop workers were in particularly high demand.\n\n> **According to official data, cited by the newspaper, the number of vacancies in the total workforce rose to 6.8% by the middle of 2023, up from 5.8% a year earlier.**\n\n> **\"If we extend the data presented by Rosstat (the official statistics agency) to the entire workforce, the shortage of workers in 2023 will tentatively amount to 4.8 million people,\"** the newspaper cited the new research as saying.\n\n> It noted that Labour Minister Anton Kotyakov had said that **workforce shortages were felt hard in the manufacturing, construction and transportation sectors**, forcing companies to raise wages to try to attract more employees.\n\n> The newspaper cited Tatyana Zakharova of Russia's University of Economics named after G.V. Plekhanov as saying that the **labour shortages would probably persist next year, as vacancies for factory workers, engineers, doctors, teachers and other professions would he especially hard to fill.**\n\n> She cited poor demographics and \"the migration of the population\" as among the reasons for the labour shortages.\n\n---\n\nSeems like the labor shortage is chronic at this point, but I guess that's what happens when you decide to switch on to 'war economy'.\n\nThis seems like a very good indicator that shows Russia is plainly *not* immune to economic pressure - *they're just very good at ignoring it*, being an autocracy and having all the niceties that go hand in hand with that.\n\nSure, it might seem to some like they're able to keep this up as long as they want - they'll 'all' work in defense - but multiple experts are worried the shortage will have an effect on GDP, and you can't eat bullets and missiles (at least most people can't for too long). \n\nRussia being significantly comprised of 'labour intensive' industries also compounds the economic pain.\n\n---\n\nHere's another, somewhat older article describing the situation leading up to the previous month a bit more verbosely:\n\n[Financial Times - Russia\u2019s war economy leaves businesses starved of labour, Nov 9 2023](https://archive.is/iYRAN):\n\n> ...\n\n> \u201cThe labour market is extremely tight,\u201d the head of a big Russian mining company told the Financial Times. \u201cIt is not just the mobilisation, or people fleeing Russia. The main problem is arms production.\u201d \n\n> The labour shortages have helped expose weaknesses in the Russian economy that contradict the rosy picture painted by the Kremlin.\n\n> President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pointed to Russia\u2019s rising gross domestic product as proof of its economic health and the failure of either war or western sanctions to inflict serious damage. But economists say the figures are flattered by big increases in defence spending and conceal structural problems that could be destabilising in the longer term.\n\n> But the war makes Russia\u2019s crisis particularly severe. Last year, 300,000 men were suddenly mobilised for fighting after Ukraine had stopped the Russian invasion in its tracks. Hundreds of thousands more, most of them educated young men, fled abroad to avoid conscription, an exodus that badly hit IT and other sectors reliant on highly skilled labour.\n\n> ...\n\n> \u201cThe state is diverting its financial resources to the defence sector, and the people are following,\u201d said Ruben Enikolopov, a research professor with Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) in Barcelona.\n\n> ...\n\n> Russia\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 3 per cent, its lowest level in 30 years, leaving businesses struggling to find workers for the labour-intensive industries that dominate the country\u2019s economy.\n\n> ...\n\n> One illustration of the shortage of workers can be found in the increasing length of the working week in Russia. It has reached its longest levels in a decade, analysts at the FinExpertiza consultancy wrote. Many factories have started operating in three shifts, a reminder of Soviet times.\n\n> \u201cThe Russian labour market and the whole economy is working at its limit, it has been squeezed to its maximum capacity and it simply cannot produce more,\u201d said UPF\u2019s Enikolopov.\n\n> In the Nizhny Novgorod region, for example, authorities report an unprecedented labour shortage, the local edition of the Kommersant newspaper reported. The number of registered unemployed fell 27 per cent in September and there were 17,000 vacancies in manufacturing in the region. Of those, 7,500 were in defence industries and demand was growing, with 1,600 positions added in the past year.\n\n> Putin acknowledged the problem this summer. \u201cThe labour shortage is beginning to have some effect on small and medium-sized enterprises, and not in the best way,\u201d he said during a meeting with manufacturing bosses in the Kremlin.\n\n> A chorus of federal officials chimed in after Putin. In September, economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov described labour shortages as \u201cthe biggest internal risk for the Russian economy\u201d.\n\n> Oleg Deripaska, the metals and mining tycoon, agreed that defence companies were attracting workers from other sectors. \u201cState capitalism has money, capital and orders. They have money, they will recruit, they will compete,\u201d he told the FT.\n\n> ...\n\n> Russia is short of 500,000 to 700,000 IT workers, the minister for digital development said in August. One manager in the telecoms sector said senior professionals were \u201ca rare commodity\u201d. Asked about the tight labour market in general, he said it was a \u201cshitshow, yes\u201d.\n\n> The owner of a Russian employment agency said there were a lot of IT job applicants but most of them were juniors who did not qualify for the vacancies. \u201cIt\u2019s worst with cyber security specialists: they\u2019re suddenly in insane demand in all government structures,\u201d the person said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t get them anywhere.\u201d\n\n> **Even weapons makers are feeling the pinch**, despite luring staff from other sectors. **Officials say the defence industry is short of 400,000 workers**.\n\n> Rostec, the vast state-owned umbrella company that encompasses the country\u2019s main arms producers and employs nearly 600,000 people, is looking for new recruits. \u201cWe are short of people, we need to hire around 25,000 to 30,000,\u201d Rostec\u2019s chief Sergei Chemezov said in an interview last week with the government\u2019s news channel Russia 24. \n\n> This admission followed dozens of local news reports \u2014 reminiscent of the Soviet era \u2014 about workers shifting to weapons factories: \u201cCooks and cashiers are being put to work on the military factory floor,\u201d one read.\n\n> Another report quoted the human resources director of a military aviation plant in Siberia who needed to hire 3,000 more staff. \u201cHaving higher education is probably a bit irrelevant now . . . Honestly, you have two hands, two legs, eyes and ears? You\u2019re in.\u201d\n\n---\n\nSeems to me the pressure should be kept up. It's having an effect, and the longer it goes, the worse it becomes. \n\nBut we'll see.",

Plekhanov as saying that the <strong>labour shortages would probably persist next year, as vacancies for factory workers, engineers, doctors, teachers and other professions would he especially hard to fill.</strong></p>\n\n<p>She cited poor demographics and &quot;the migration of the population&quot; as among the reasons for the labour shortages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Seems like the labor shortage is chronic at this point, but I guess that&#39;s what happens when you decide to switch on to &#39;war economy&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>This seems like a very good indicator that shows Russia is plainly <em>not</em> immune to economic pressure - <em>they&#39;re just very good at ignoring it</em>, being an autocracy and having all the niceties that go hand in hand with that.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, it might seem to some like they&#39;re able to keep this up as long as they want - they&#39;ll &#39;all&#39; work in defense - but multiple experts are worried the shortage will have an effect on GDP, and you can&#39;t eat bullets and missiles (at least most people can&#39;t for too long). </p>\n\n<p>Russia being significantly comprised of &#39;labour intensive&#39; industries also compounds the economic pain.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s another, somewhat older article describing the situation leading up to the previous month a bit more verbosely:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/iYRAN\">Financial Times - Russia\u2019s war economy leaves businesses starved of labour, Nov 9 2023</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe labour market is extremely tight,\u201d the head of a big Russian mining company told the Financial Times. \u201cIt is not just the mobilisation, or people fleeing Russia. The main problem is arms production.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The labour shortages have helped expose weaknesses in the Russian economy that contradict the rosy picture painted by the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pointed to Russia\u2019s rising gross domestic product as proof of its economic health and the failure of either war or western sanctions to inflict serious damage. But economists say the figures are flattered by big increases in defence spending and conceal structural problems that could be destabilising in the longer term.</p>\n\n<p>But the war makes Russia\u2019s crisis particularly severe. Last year, 300,000 men were suddenly mobilised for fighting after Ukraine had stopped the Russian invasion in its tracks. Hundreds of thousands more, most of them educated young men, fled abroad to avoid conscription, an exodus that badly hit IT and other sectors reliant on highly skilled labour.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe state is diverting its financial resources to the defence sector, and the people are following,\u201d said Ruben Enikolopov, a research professor with Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) in Barcelona.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 3 per cent, its lowest level in 30 years, leaving businesses struggling to find workers for the labour-intensive industries that dominate the country\u2019s economy.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>One illustration of the shortage of workers can be found in the increasing length of the working week in Russia. It has reached its longest levels in a decade, analysts at the FinExpertiza consultancy wrote. Many factories have started operating in three shifts, a reminder of Soviet times.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Russian labour market and the whole economy is working at its limit, it has been squeezed to its maximum capacity and it simply cannot produce more,\u201d said UPF\u2019s Enikolopov.</p>\n\n<p>In the Nizhny Novgorod region, for example, authorities report an unprecedented labour shortage, the local edition of the Kommersant newspaper reported. The number of registered unemployed fell 27 per cent in September and there were 17,000 vacancies in manufacturing in the region. Of those, 7,500 were in defence industries and demand was growing, with 1,600 positions added in the past year.</p>\n\n<p>Putin acknowledged the problem this summer. \u201cThe labour shortage is beginning to have some effect on small and medium-sized enterprises, and not in the best way,\u201d he said during a meeting with manufacturing bosses in the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>A chorus of federal officials chimed in after Putin. In September, economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov described labour shortages as \u201cthe biggest internal risk for the Russian economy\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Oleg Deripaska, the metals and mining tycoon, agreed that defence companies were attracting workers from other sectors. \u201cState capitalism has money, capital and orders. They have money, they will recruit, they will compete,\u201d he told the FT.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Russia is short of 500,000 to 700,000 IT workers, the minister for digital development said in August. One manager in the telecoms sector said senior professionals were \u201ca rare commodity\u201d. Asked about the tight labour market in general, he said it was a \u201cshitshow, yes\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The owner of a Russian employment agency said there were a lot of IT job applicants but most of them were juniors who did not qualify for the vacancies. \u201cIt\u2019s worst with cyber security specialists: they\u2019re suddenly in insane demand in all government structures,\u201d the person said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t get them anywhere.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Even weapons makers are feeling the pinch</strong>, despite luring staff from other sectors. <strong>Officials say the defence industry is short of 400,000 workers</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Rostec, the vast state-owned umbrella company that encompasses the country\u2019s main arms producers and employs nearly 600,000 people, is looking for new recruits. \u201cWe are short of people, we need to hire around 25,000 to 30,000,\u201d Rostec\u2019s chief Sergei Chemezov said in an interview last week with the government\u2019s news channel Russia 24. </p>\n\n<p>This admission followed dozens of local news reports \u2014 reminiscent of the Soviet era \u2014 about workers shifting to weapons factories: \u201cCooks and cashiers are being put to work on the military factory floor,\u201d one read.</p>\n\n<p>Another report quoted the human resources director of a military aviation plant in Siberia who needed to hire 3,000 more staff. \u201cHaving higher education is probably a bit irrelevant now . . . Honestly, you have two hands, two legs, eyes and ears? You\u2019re in.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Seems to me the pressure should be kept up. It&#39;s having an effect, and the longer it goes, the worse it becomes. </p>\n\n<p>But we&#39;ll see.</p>\n</div>",

Most container shipping is being diverted around Africa, which takes 11-15 days longer, which means Europe-Asia shipping capacity has been reduced by 20%-25% while becoming more expensive.  Tankers carrying refined petroleum products are also being diverted around Africa, and only unrefined crude is being transported through Red Sea.\n\nIf the situation is unaddressed, shipping cost will remain higher.  This will add to cost of any manufacturing operation whose supply chain is spread across EU and Asia, making them noncompetitive against manufacturing with supply chain spread else where.  So biggest losers seem to be companies in EU, China, and India.  Russian crude also goes to India and China through Red Sea, and it's unclear if Houthis are able or willing to spare this shipment from their attacks.\n\nSo why is US spearheading the effort to protect the shipping in Red Sea?  My speculation is that EU is putting US up to this, since they are already suffering economically from effects of Ukraine war, and are incapable taking necessary naval actions themselves.  EU probably threatened cutting diplomatic and economic ties with Israel if actions are not taken.  So US is taking some token action to 'throw a bone' to EU allies.  We will see if US-led forces will protect Russian and Chinese shipping.\n\nI'm also curious what China is doing.  It has a naval task force in the general area.  However, will they fight Houthis, an Iran's proxy?  I bet they are intensively talking to Iran to tell Houthis not to attack ships traveling to and from China, and Iran is asking for some handouts.  I'm sure Iran would love to be able to make money from area denial.\n\nEDIT: WION (Indian news) is now reporting that an Indian ship has been attacked and INS Kochi and INS Kolkata are en route to Gulf of Aden.",

But I think that the US is tired of being the world police. So the US has been using these crises over the last couple years to encourage other countries to try handling their problems. For example, the US prioritized a communal response to the invasion of Ukraine, and getting European allies to donate and produce military equipment and ammunition.

The US could surely defeat Yemen, let alone stop them from attacking ships. But other countries are also suffering from these attacks, and so it's a useful opportunity to let them practice solving these sorts of problems and get them accustomed to doing things instead of waiting for the US to solve all trade related problems. It seems to me that your argument is that if the US can't guarantee free trade, the other democracies of the world will feel helpless and let China, Russia, Iran, or whoever take over. But the alternative response is that they start protecting trade themselves, which seems far more likely to me.\n\nThe last point I'd make is that being strong is scary to those around you, and right now, as it has been for decades, the US is without any dispute the strongest country in the world militarily.

Hitting any civilian ships with weapons in my eyes would be disruptive.\n\nYes, but mostly because of increased insurance cost and making some companies decide to go around Africa adding to the journey that translates to cost as well. Overall the red sea is important, but not the most important trade route in the world (not even the second or third). So they definetley distrupt trade. They even took over merchant ships. It is a problem and it has far reaching effects. There is a very well written post below here that explains the effected parties and approximate costs involved. Look it up. Original questions was posted by Stutterer2101 but the answers where you would find detailed explanation to all of your questions.\n\n> Has America abandoned an attempt to forcibly end this due to naval capabilities?\n\nNo, the US has more then enough naval capabilities to handle this if they want. There are many reasons why we see a \"small resposne\". Amongst them that the US dont want to waste missiles, arent really effected by this too much (increased oil prices are actually good for them as well), their population probably wouldnt want to see another operation in the middle east and there is an election coming. They can use it as a card against Israel (if they would solve it, they couldnt. So they can use it to force Israel to do X or Y) and there are a long list of things that we probably cant know or that I am leaving out or missing.\n\n> If so how is this not an unmitigated disaster?

That's some damn good math figurin' right there! Super important variable included that totally screws with the conclusion? Get rid of that variable! \n\nFor those thinking the OP's attrition math is positive news, it's time to recalibrate. Time and again the wrong metrics are viewed and touted for signs of victory, while the actual important ones are ignored. Often those metrics aren't even quantifiable, they're intangibles.

But hey, they&#39;ll get it right some day. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe Krynky?</p>\n\n<p>A river crossing operation where it&#39;s impossible to reinforce the bridgehead with more than a few companies of dismounted infantry due to the unbearable logistical burden, worsened since it&#39;s been regularly interdicted by Russian recon fires complex.</p>\n\n<p>With dismounted UAF Marines holding the eastern bank who are reported to be taking such heavy losses that the troops themselves are going out of their way to tell their stories to UA and Western press, declaring they&#39;re being used in extremely callous manner not much different than Russian &quot;Meat&quot; disposable infantry. </p>\n\n<p>In the middle of a major nationwide Ukrainian manpower recruitment crisis stemming from poor morale and lack of willingness of too much of the military aged male population of Ukraine, fearing service because <strong>THEY DON&#39;T WANT TO BE USED AS CANNON FODDER</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Fun fact, the Twitter guy deliberately <a href=\"https://x.com/naalsio26/status/1738411872951374013?s=20\">didn&#39;t count UAF boats used to transport troops and supplies as vehicles</a>, despite them being utterly critical for the sustainment of the UAF bridgehead, to transport reinforcements, relief in place, casualty evacuation, and supplies. And now being deliberately targeted by the Russians, often using FPV drones, laser guided arty, and precision glide bombs, guided by ISTAR drones, hitting them on the river bank landings or often while crossing. That&#39;s some damn good math figurin&#39; right there! Super important variable included that totally screws with the conclusion? Get rid of that variable! </p>\n\n<p>For those thinking the OP&#39;s attrition math is positive news, it&#39;s time to recalibrate. Time and again the wrong metrics are viewed and touted for signs of victory, while the actual important ones are ignored. Often those metrics aren&#39;t even quantifiable, they&#39;re intangibles. Those who refuse to recalibrate are very likely going to be for a rude awakening, potentially soon, if the current mindset is maintained.</p>\n</div>",

We simply have no access to any good data on personnel casualties outside of declassified US intel reports unlike pictures of destroyed equipment which can and are confirmed independently.\n\nAgain, you say UKR marines are suffering high casualties and they almost certainly are but we have no idea what exactly these numbers are and we don't know what RU casualties are in juxtaposition to UKR numbers. So any interpretation from that point forward requires a lot of \"fill in the blank\" based on people's varying personal opinions.\n\n>Fun fact, the Twitter guy deliberately [didn't count UAF boats used to transport troops and supplies as vehicles](https://x.com/naalsio26/status/1738411872951374013?s=20), despite them being utterly critical for the sustainment of the UAF bridgehead, to transport reinforcements, relief in place, casualty evacuation, and supplies. And now being deliberately targeted by the Russians, often using FPV drones, laser guided arty, and precision glide bombs, guided by ISTAR drones, hitting them on the river bank landings or often while crossing. That's some damn good math figurin' right there! Super important variable included that totally screws with the conclusion? Get rid of that variable! \n\n\nYou're acting like this is some sort of big conspiracy theory when he is open about not including. Yes, there are issues with not counting them as they're important in this area but let's earnestly examine several different points.\n\n1.Ukraine is not going to run out of rinky dink dinghy boats to ferry people across the river.\n\n\n2.Don't exactly know how you plan on counting and providing photographic proof of wrecks at the bottom of a river but please feel free to elucidate your genius strategy for doing so.\n\n\n3. Realistically outside of this situation there are very few places where Ukraine is going to be conducting amphibious landings. It's not a critical resource that will prove pivotal later in the war because Ukraine likely won't ever be in a position where the land situation is so favorable that they could conduct an amphibious landing on Crimea and even if it was they have no way of protecting those assets from RU subs, ships, FPVs, artillery, missiles, etc. \n\n\n>For those thinking the OP's attrition math is positive news, it's time to recalibrate.

We simply have no access to any good data on personnel casualties outside of declassified US intel reports unlike pictures of destroyed equipment which can and are confirmed independently.</p>\n\n<p>Again, you say UKR marines are suffering high casualties and they almost certainly are but we have no idea what exactly these numbers are and we don&#39;t know what RU casualties are in juxtaposition to UKR numbers. So any interpretation from that point forward requires a lot of &quot;fill in the blank&quot; based on people&#39;s varying personal opinions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fun fact, the Twitter guy deliberately <a href=\"https://x.com/naalsio26/status/1738411872951374013?s=20\">didn&#39;t count UAF boats used to transport troops and supplies as vehicles</a>, despite them being utterly critical for the sustainment of the UAF bridgehead, to transport reinforcements, relief in place, casualty evacuation, and supplies. And now being deliberately targeted by the Russians, often using FPV drones, laser guided arty, and precision glide bombs, guided by ISTAR drones, hitting them on the river bank landings or often while crossing. That&#39;s some damn good math figurin&#39; right there! Super important variable included that totally screws with the conclusion? Get rid of that variable! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re acting like this is some sort of big conspiracy theory when he is open about not including. Yes, there are issues with not counting them as they&#39;re important in this area but let&#39;s earnestly examine several different points.</p>\n\n<p>1.Ukraine is not going to run out of rinky dink dinghy boats to ferry people across the river.</p>\n\n<p>2.Don&#39;t exactly know how you plan on counting and providing photographic proof of wrecks at the bottom of a river but please feel free to elucidate your genius strategy for doing so.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Realistically outside of this situation there are very few places where Ukraine is going to be conducting amphibious landings. It&#39;s not a critical resource that will prove pivotal later in the war because Ukraine likely won&#39;t ever be in a position where the land situation is so favorable that they could conduct an amphibious landing on Crimea and even if it was they have no way of protecting those assets from RU subs, ships, FPVs, artillery, missiles, etc. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For those thinking the OP&#39;s attrition math is positive news, it&#39;s time to recalibrate.
