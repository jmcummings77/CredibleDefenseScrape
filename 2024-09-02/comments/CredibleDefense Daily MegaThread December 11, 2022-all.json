Not Putin level but still.\nBasically I know a &quot;folk&quot; &quot;esoteric&quot; Ukrainian band that mostly performs adobted old Rus and Ukrainian songs. Dugin&amp;co were extremely obsessed with it and had it perform in Russia on multiple occasions. Dugins late daughter absolutely loved it. </p>\n\n<p>Apparently they viewed Ukrainian and rus tradition, including paganism as something that has to be restored. At that time they were somewhat scared that they would lose Ukraine because they saw it as a spiritual motherland.</p>\n\n<p>This is even less credible but apparently these ideas were also present in the actual Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>Also this might be outdated because it&#39;s info from before 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hsNKSbTNd5I\">The band </a></p>\n</div>",

To suppress with small arms means either hitting some of the enemy (best suppressive effect is causing casualties) or threatening them with close enough misses that they stop whatever it was they were doing to take cover/hide. It's a mix of volume and accuracy, it's entirely psychological, and is very dependent on situation, mission, enemy morale, and other conditions. \n\nTo find enemy who aren't easily spotted one is supposed to scan for various target identifiers like movement, muzzle signature, shine, etc. If that doesn't work and known enemy positions can't be found then look for likely or suspected positions. When under fire, those who spot the enemy are supposed to communicate those location to team members, giving direction, distance, description. Or if nothing else, shoot where the other guy is shooting (which is how most small arms fire happens).\n\nWhen firing at likely or suspected positions, its best done in semi auto or very short bursts on auto, aiming where the enemy could be. In a forest, firing into trees right in front of you or high up far above someone standing would have far less effect than around the base of a tree where someone prone, kneeling, or standing behind it might be exposed if they peaked out  or in between trees around 1 meter off the ground trying to catch them moving tree to tree, or even preventing them from doing anything but low crawling.\n\nForest fighting can be a nightmare. Engagement distances are often much shorter than normal because trees block line of sight. It's potentially easier to get flanked or surprised by an unseen enemy. Coordination becomes tougher because you might not see your teammates, it's especially tough for small unit leaders trying to keep accountability of and control their troops. It's surprising easy to get lost. Incoming mortars or arty often hits the trees creating a wood splinter airburst effect that is extremely dangerous. Throwing grenades is EXTREMELY dangerous because you can hit a tree and have it bounce right back at you. A positive is that trees about 16 inches/40 cm thick will stop most small arms bullets from penetrating, so there is often an abundance of decent cover available, especially while doing rushes.",

Being on a hill or roads gives it tactical importance, maybe operational. You're using the wrong phrase.\n\nSecondly, that article was about Popasna's importance in relation to the Russian offensive in May heading north from the existing JFO front lines, which Popasna sat on. The city's value was a road intersection, which gave it tactical significance because there was a north facing road leading deeper into Luhansk west of the Donets. After pushing the UAF out of the city the Russians launched a follow on attack on the defenses outside the city and punched through them, allowing them to then gain operational level effects because they were able to drive north and nearly severe the primary GLOC leading to Lysychansk (eventually doing it months later). That ultimately allowed the Russians to outflank Luhansk oblast defenses that extended to the Donets river.

So frustrating...</p>\n\n<p>Here is what that article says, it actually did define strategy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scholars and practitioners provide a multiplicity of definitions of strategy and military strategy (many equate the two). Richard Betts (2004: 6) defines strategy <strong>\u201cas a plan for using military means to achieve political ends.\u201d</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does that sound like shit a platoon is involved in? </p>\n\n<p>If strategy is what the military does to try to achieve the political end, they need to win the war to achieve them. And that&#39;s what the strategic level is involved in. </p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to understand the levels to use them correctly is that the tactical level is about winning battles, the operational level is about winning campaigns, and the strategic level is about winning wars. It&#39;s actually a bit more complicated than that but to go in more depth involves lots of writing on my part and reading on yours, which is a waste of time because you don&#39;t read, you&#39;re happy to remain ignorant because you&#39;d rather LARP as a military analyst then actually learn about the subject first.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve said it to you before and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll say it again in the future: You should read more and post less.</p>\n</div>",
