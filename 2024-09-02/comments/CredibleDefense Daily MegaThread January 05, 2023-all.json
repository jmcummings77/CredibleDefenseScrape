Whatever you deliver needs to be supplied.\n\nb) A bunch of other countries have delivered their own systems (CAESARs, PzH 2000, Krab etc.), which through their shoot-and-scoot, MRSI and high precision can make up for nominally larger numbers of Russian artillery. And then there's also HIMARS. Ukraine has managed to partially negate Russia's artillery advantage either way.\n\nImportantly, the US only has/had(?) about 1,000 M777 systems in use anyway. 142 of them is about 15%. So 'only' seems to be the wrong word here. The US has 6,230 Bradleys. 15% of that would be over 900 units.\n\nAdd to that the fact that artillery that is used competently is at a much lower risk of being destroyed than even the best IFV being thrown into an armoured assault.\n\nSo your comparison doesn't make much sense, I'm afraid.",

There is basically no desire to drawdown US forces anywhere, people are instead talking about *ramping up* forces. A lot of people in this thread have said 'oh well the US Army probably wouldn't play a big role in that war.' First you dont know that, and horizontal escalation beyond Taiwan has been a serious concern. Second, even if youre right (and I think thats an entirely correct way to look at that conflict) the US Army *itself* sees this as an existential issue for them. This has come up time after time since WWII. It looks like war changes, on service stands above the others in terms of capability fit, and tries to kill the others. And so they throw a fit. The Army will not accept a situation in which it is left out of China warplanning. Even if that means buying systems which are dumb (land based anti shipping missiles & HIMARS, capabilities which the Navy & AF should be covering). Likewise the Army will not be happy if you take away their toys. They dont want to spend money buying more Brads, nor do they want to lose the combat capability which might play into a future war scenario. There was a Cold War era motto, \"Russias come and go.

There is basically no desire to drawdown US forces anywhere, people are instead talking about <em>ramping up</em> forces. A lot of people in this thread have said &#39;oh well the US Army probably wouldn&#39;t play a big role in that war.&#39; First you dont know that, and horizontal escalation beyond Taiwan has been a serious concern. Second, even if youre right (and I think thats an entirely correct way to look at that conflict) the US Army <em>itself</em> sees this as an existential issue for them. This has come up time after time since WWII. It looks like war changes, on service stands above the others in terms of capability fit, and tries to kill the others. And so they throw a fit. The Army will not accept a situation in which it is left out of China warplanning. Even if that means buying systems which are dumb (land based anti shipping missiles &amp; HIMARS, capabilities which the Navy &amp; AF should be covering). Likewise the Army will not be happy if you take away their toys. They dont want to spend money buying more Brads, nor do they want to lose the combat capability which might play into a future war scenario. There was a Cold War era motto, &quot;Russias come and go. But the Navy is forever.&quot; They ultimately dont care who wins in Ukraine as long as the war legitimizes what they&#39;ve been saying re: spending, material, and doctrine. </p>\n\n<p>People meme on the size of the DoD&#39;s budget, and its an important issue vis-a-vis domestic politics.

Bad faith attempts at peace aren't attempts at peace in any sense. In fact they are often counterproductive. \n\n>Why is it unreasonable for a defending power to demand the invader leave?\n\nThis isn't about \"reasonableness\". It's about how tenable their negotiating demands are. If Germany's demands in may 1945 were for Russia and the Allies to leave all 1939 territories, the Allies would have laughed. I'm not saying Ukraine = Germany, but I am saying that negotiations are based on nothing more than pragmatism. As long as Russia still has a will and way to occupy the contested territories, it will be silly to beg them to leave using a piece of paper.",

It's no more useful than Russia demanding control of Kyiv. You are really trying hard to insert what you think is right or wrong here. What is right and wrong has nothing to do with it. Nothing at all. Right and wrong are not preconditions for a peace treaty. Only what is viable. \n\nRussia is not winning, but Ukraine is not clearly able to push them to the point of total surrender.

                        "body": "I think that is an okay-ish explanation, but it does run up against the fact that the Ukrainian military is some 500,000 people, most of whom are not on the frontlines at any given time, and different elements of it could work on different things simultaneously. \n\nFor instance, there is really no practical reason that a good 100,000 Ukrainian reservists, sitting behind the lines, could not have been rotated through some US bases in Europe by now and trained for combat to a level vastly beyond what they could come by in Ukraine. Even if this had just been classroom teaching, and mock exercises in random fields, this would be invaluable to most soldiers and a relatively light task for a national government to pull off. Essentially it means finding some 5000 trainers, some 5000 translators, and food and clothing for a lot of people in barracks. Since that latter task is pretty much the number one job of the US military anyways, to suddenly field huge numbers of people in places on short notice, I don't think it would have been insurmountable.\n\nI think realistically we have to accept that at least part of the explanation for the slow pace of things has been an extreme reluctance on the part of Western leadership to give the appearance of being heavily involved. In the US, Biden is no doubt extremely wary of attacks from the populist Right that America is getting entangled in a foreign war. In Europe, the fear seems to be getting on the hook financially for anything.

Even if this had just been classroom teaching, and mock exercises in random fields, this would be invaluable to most soldiers and a relatively light task for a national government to pull off. Essentially it means finding some 5000 trainers, some 5000 translators, and food and clothing for a lot of people in barracks. Since that latter task is pretty much the number one job of the US military anyways, to suddenly field huge numbers of people in places on short notice, I don&#39;t think it would have been insurmountable.</p>\n\n<p>I think realistically we have to accept that at least part of the explanation for the slow pace of things has been an extreme reluctance on the part of Western leadership to give the appearance of being heavily involved. In the US, Biden is no doubt extremely wary of attacks from the populist Right that America is getting entangled in a foreign war. In Europe, the fear seems to be getting on the hook financially for anything.

So you&#39;re talking about dozens of planes launching huge numbers of ground attack munitions at legitimate Russian territory, per site. That is pretty WWIII level.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s a meaningful gesture (though I&#39;m curious on the delivery date), but it buys time for Brad&#39;s in storage to start the refurb process to directly go to Ukraine, along with basic equipment, spare parts, ammo, etc. But that&#39;ll take years to get more than a few battalions. But in the long term it&#39;ll be constant, sustainable, and most of all, supportable, which is how it&#39;s supposed to work.</p>\n</div>",

What would the integration of this unit look like?\n2. What would be the economic effect globally if the war suddenly ended? Europe/America/China/OPEC in particular.\n3. What percentage of the time does America fight wars through proxies versus on its own? Does it make sense for American procurement to give greater (than current) extra value to weapons that can be easily transferred to proxies without too much of a burden in terms of technology risk, training requirements, and inter-compatibility with foreign stocks?\n4. How significant is $300 billion to Putin? What is the likelihood that these frozen assets end up back in Russia\u2019s hand as part of a peace deal? Would this be enough to change Kremlin minds about the inviolability of Crimea?\n5. Determining the status of the territorial reconquest is difficult because the land can be denominated as square kilometers, towns, oblasts, pre-conflict populations, defense lines etc. For example, if Russia broke through ten natural high-level defense lines during the invasion in Donetsk, and only 4 of those defense lines have been reconquered, this may suggest that 40% of the \u2018work\u2019 is done as compared to a metric based on the conquering and reconquering of enumerated towns. What is the most useful way to quantify how much was conquered, how much has been reconquered, and what remains to be reconquered when it comes to a military analysis?\n6. Is there any analysis of who these Russian prisoner \"volunteers\" are? What does the overall Russian prison population look like in terms of crimes, ages, region, sentence, and who among them is eligible and taking advantage of this eligibility? The coverage I have read seems very simplistic talking about \"thousands\" but then only mentioning murder and rape when I assume that to gather that number would require recruiting a lot of small-time criminals who haven't been forsaken by their families.\n7. What are the mechanics of the situation that would follow a hypothetical Ukrainian surprise assault and capture of Belgorod? What Russian military units shift from the current front lines inside of Ukraine and where do they go? How many Russian nuclear weapons are used and where do they strike and to what effect? Is there a pre-strike conversation between Putin and other world leaders such as Xi? What happens to Western aid?\n8. What is the basic outline of the escalation ladder between The West and Iran and how does it compare to the outline between The West and Russia?\n9. What is the intelligence / state department / etc theory behind supporting replacements for removed dictators? Does the US not believe in the efficacy of supporting a specific replacement for Putin, or does it not want to set some precedent, or something else? If Putin died tomorrow and Biden, Modi, Xi, MBS all endorsed one specific successor with implied forcefulness, what would happen? Which one of those leaders has interests too divergent from the others to be able to find a compromise choice and agree to do this?\n10.

            "body": "> Is China really the same as Russia?\n\nNo. Good God, no. \n\nHere is a basic level breakdown of how the two are completely different. \n\n**Economics:** whether you believe China's faking their economic data or not, what you cannot deny is that the Chinese economy vastly dwarfs the Russian one, with nominal GDP at 10x that of Russia. China also has the majority of the world's heavy industries, which gives it a huge industrial base to build on top of. And recent acquisitions of [advanced manufacturing companies](https://chinaobservers.eu/after-kuka-germanys-lessons-learned-from-chinese-takeovers) has only bolstered Chinese industrial proficiency. \n\n**Procurement:** On top of Chinese economic strength, Chinese procurement of military hardware is lightyears ahead of Russia. Consider both countries' 5th-gen programme:\n\n- Su-57\n  - first flight: 2010\n  - numbers produced: 21\n- J-20\n  - first flight: 2009\n  - numbers produced: 150-208\n\n**Doctrine:** this is the biggest one. Most of the current \"China hands\" in DC either don't speak/read Chinese themselves, or got started in their careers from the Cold War, which meant that they spent much more time being familiar with the Soviets and Russians, and not so much with the PRC. \n\nThe inability to speak/read Chinese puts them at a disadvantage because they cannot quickly parse/read the latest out of the PRC. The only exceptions to this are Lyle Goldstein and Chas Freeman, both of whom can speak Chinese without accent. And both of whom has been more or less cast out of the main DC think tank circles on US policy towards China. \n\nThe inability to speak Chinese means a lot of these \"China hands\" have lazily looked at China, sees that it's notionally \"communist\", and concluded that the PLA must operate under the same doctrine as the Russian armed forces. And if this were 1990, then sure, that might've been true. Then Desert Storm happened, and China's reaction was a hard pivot away from an artillery-centric ground war of massed armor formations and towards warfare enabled by information and sensors. \n\nModern PLA doctrine is [much closer to the US way of war](https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/umy3lz/will_the_chinese_navy_in_the_future_operate_on_a/i85j8ju/) than the Russian way of war.\n\n**Experience:** a lot of ink has been spilled on the PLA having no experience in warfare, but the reality is: nobody has experience fighting a near peer conventional war. Twenty years of dunking on AK-touting goat herders with the luxury of an uncontested airspace does not make for good experience in a modern NAVAIR conflict.\n\n----\n\nEDIT: Addendums on C2\n\n**Command and Control:** you can spot a lot of the same talking points about China from the DC think tank circles: \n\n- China can't exercise proper command and control\n- Taiwan invasion logistically and operationally complex\n- China has no experience with joint operations\n\nAll of which are true... before 2015. But even then, China began consolidating its space-based ISRs under a single unified command of the Strategic Support Force. This was then mirrored by the USSF at the end of 2019, and the actual transfer of the assets themselves only started happening end of 2022/start of 2023. \n\nMost writings on the future of warfare talk about AI-enabled warfare. The gist is basically using AI/ML algorithms to rapidly process the almost overwhelming amount of information provided by sensors in different domains (sea, space, air, land, etc.) and gain situational awareness faster than the enemy. This is a part of the C2 equation where software advancement can greatly enhance legacy hardware. Just look at how effective Ukrainian artillery targeting was in the early days of the war using *the same tubes as the Russians*. While fire controls and procedures were largely unchanged, target acquisition was assisted by software advancements that allowed Ukraine to minimize counter-battery threat by utilizing TOT missions from distributed tubes without much change from normal CONOPS. \n\nChina's large civilian AI/ML presence is being used by the PLA to augment its own abilities to prosecute an informational AI-enabled conflict. If your troops' individual skills at passing along information are only 70% as proficient as the other side, but you can generate 200% data and process the data 110% faster than your opponent, then you gain the information edge and can make up that deficiency in command and control. \n\nIf you can put up a ton of unmanned systems to act as both sensor and shooters, then you naturally need a large data processing \"brain\" that centralizes joint ops across multiple domains. And that's exactly what the PLA has been doing. Joint ops for the PLA at this point is *baked in*, and their C2 is evolving directly out of that. \n\nSOURCES - notice how these are already technically outdated since they're from 2018 analyzing stuff coming out of China from 2016-2017:\n\n- [RAND paper on PLA CONOPS](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA300/RRA394-1/RAND_RRA394-1.pdf)\n- [RAND paper on PLA use of big data analytics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA176-1.html)",
