      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

            "body": "> the bigger impact is probably in losses to crew \n\nPilots cost something on the order of $3m to train. It takes years, and hundreds of hours flying vehicles that are incredibly expensive to operate. I'm not sure about the exact costs for the Ka-52, but in general Russian aircraft are not substantially cheaper than comparable western vehicles. For example, an Su-35 costs about as much to fly per hours as an F/A-18E/F would, around $30,000. [So looking at comparable helicopter operational costs for the US](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a41956551/cost-per-hour-to-fly-us-military-aircraft/), a Ka-52 probably costs something on the order of $5,000 (if comparable to an Apache) - $20,000 (if comparable to a Viper) per hour to keep flying. Russia may be able to increase the production of aircraft, but they can only accelerate pilot training so much without risking throwing a very expensive plane or helicopter away by putting it in the hands of someone without sufficient experience. The result is a years-long lag time between starting up an expansion of their pilot training programs and the actual production of more combat ready crews or pilots, which makes losses among experienced personnel especially painful for the Russians. \n\n> the threat of similar attacks in the future.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the most important effect. ATACMs supplemented with JDAMS, GMLRs, GLSDBs, and 155mm cluster allows the Ukrainians to hold any Russian assets within 300km or so of the front at risk. The new long range capabilities thus deny the Russians the use of Berdyansk airport, or any other air base within ATACMs range. That in turn forces them to station their attack helicopters and fighters farther away, which, even if it does not immediately push the aircraft out of range of the front entirely, will at a minimum increase response times for Ka-52s counterattacking to contain Ukrainian assaults and will reduce the time the aircraft can spend on target throwing ATGMs at Ukrainian tanks before it runs out of fuel.\n\nThe margin of victory for breaching assaults is often incredibly thin, where even a few minutes of delay can doom an attack against a fortified line because it gives the enemy more time to rally their mobile reserves for a counterattack. Ka-52s have been particularly valuable during the spring/summer counteroffensive as a rapid reaction force capable of temporarily halting or disrupting Ukrainian offensive formations while heavier/more elite ground forces like the VDV move into position for a flanking attack against the salient.

Ukraine has been talking about being a week or so away from a major breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia since mid August but still no closer. But they still want a victory, the only way to score one there is to force the Russians to commit reserves elsewhere. They need to do something audacious to pull that off. \n\nPreviously, the Velyka Novosilkav axis seems to have been used as a supporting axis to pull local Russian reserves away from the Tokmak axis. But that wasn't going anywhere, was quite expensive in UAF losses and was seriously competing for resources; it looks like the UAF shut that down a month ago at least to focus on the Tokmak axis. Now it seems they used some of those VN axis units to pull off this river crossing. That makes some sense, why try to keep butting against strong defenses for a supporting attack? Instead launch another supporting attack somewhere else that has a highe chance of accomplishing it's mission, forcing the Russians to deal with a challenging tactical situation in addition to dealing with the main effort.\n\nThe loss of the Nova Kakhovka dam was one of the best things to happen to Ukraine in terms of a future river crossing of the Dnieper. I'm surprised the UAF waited this long to exploit it, though the big reason they couldn't earlier was likely the lack of large force uncommitted to pull it off. With the Velyka Novosilkav axis shut down, freeing up some brigades, now they have some. \n\nWith no dam to worry about, there is no major threat to stop a river crossing other than local Russian defenses. This late in the season, the Russians  likely deemed unlikely the UAF would try anything, so the Russian defense was probably minimal with them pulling most units to reinforce Zaporizhzhia. Creating a weak point that was light enough for the UAF to cross a few battalions at a minimum, starting to grab a legit foothold, though a lodgement against a counterattack might be a different story. \n\nAnd exploiting that is a far harder task, even if they can defeat counterattacks, the Russians still have a very deep defense in depth in that location, all the roads leading anywhere important have fixed defenses situated at every road junction. So even if the UAF can grab a foothold it'll likely only get the Ukrainians a bridgehead they can't exploit unless the Zaporizhzhia axis totally breaks through. But if they can pull that off, then they have a dual axis capable of heading to the Isthmus of Perekop. \n\nCould be decisive, though now much does the UAF have in reserve to commit to exploit success there? It's 50 miles as the crow flies just to get to the western edge of the Isthmus, and that job would likely be secondary to clearing the rest of the river edge around that area to grab more ground for a proper lodgement. Meanwhile there are two corps' worth of brigades grinding it out on the Tokmak axis. But will the Tavria operational grouping have an easier time pushing the Tokmak axis with or without a strong supporting axis? We will see...\n\nShould be interesting how this unfolds.",

By all accounts Hamas itself hasn't been hurt badly, it's mostly just civilians. \n\n\nI seriously don't get how people keep acting like Hamas didn't expect Israel, of all countries, not to retaliate heavily after a terrorist strike Hamas made sure was as horrible as possible. Hamas planned this years in advance. Israel has always responded brutally to way smaller offenses.\n\n\nIn fact I'm pretty sure Hamas had expected Israel to already be invading. Everyone did.

The very first reply was by an Israeli that twitter curtly translated to me as &quot;English, retards! English!&quot;</p>\n</div>",

So far, IMO, we can count on two defections - Buck and Gimenez - no matter what happens. Depending on the quorum, Jordan can only lose four or five GOP votes. People are inevitably gonna start caving because of the immense pressure from Jordan&#39;s deputies and outside groups (including Trump, who endorsed Jordan last week), but it&#39;s kind of a coin toss at this point, with conflicting reports saying there&#39;ll be more defections in the second vote, while others say some of the holdouts have already gone on record that they&#39;d vote for Jordan.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Russia can do what it did in response to HIMARS attacks on it's ammo dumps: remove them further behind the lines to get them out of range and disperse them to make any single target less important. These are relatively simple actions that are probably already taking place as Russia assesses the damage and determines that it was an ATAMCS strike after all. But nothing comes for free.

Turkey was attacked by PKK terrorists just a few weeks ago, no one died save the attackers, and Turkey in response has launched hundreds of attacks on PKK affiliated groups in three different countries, causing hundreds of civilian casualties, and no one bats an eye.</p>\n</div>",

Had Hamas militants run rampant in say, several German towns instead of Israeli kibbutz, the death count would've been exponentially higher, as most Israelis have hardened bomb shelters and a significant number own firearms. At Be'eri, Palestinian militants held the town for nearly 24 hours but \"only\" managed to kill 300 of the 1300 residents specifically because every home is a mini fortress. \n\nBy contrast, Hamas uses tactics that are meant to maximize the civilian body count. You ever wonder why Hamas is able to build massive tunnel complexes and smuggle huge quantities of weapons into their \"open air prison\" but there aren't bomb shelters for Palestinian civilians? Why do you think Hamas purposefully fires rockets from schoolgrounds and apartment buildings, and builds their bunkers underneath civilian infrastructure and residences? \n\n>\"Palestinians are born anti semites so of course they're not allowed any hope, no carrot, only stick.\"\n\nI'm genuinely curious what you think would be an appropriate solution to this conflict.",

I agree that the conditions Palestinians endure makes it an exceptional breeding ground for extremism, but let&#39;s not pretend that&#39;s the only thing happening here. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We in the west have strong cultural ties with Israel, but countries that do not see Israel slaughtering 10x as many kids as Hamas and naturally conclude Israel is at fault</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Hamas body count is lower only because Israel goes to great lengths to protect their people. Had Hamas militants run rampant in say, several German towns instead of Israeli kibbutz, the death count would&#39;ve been exponentially higher, as most Israelis have hardened bomb shelters and a significant number own firearms. At Be&#39;eri, Palestinian militants held the town for nearly 24 hours but &quot;only&quot; managed to kill 300 of the 1300 residents specifically because every home is a mini fortress. </p>\n\n<p>By contrast, Hamas uses tactics that are meant to maximize the civilian body count. You ever wonder why Hamas is able to build massive tunnel complexes and smuggle huge quantities of weapons into their &quot;open air prison&quot; but there aren&#39;t bomb shelters for Palestinian civilians? Why do you think Hamas purposefully fires rockets from schoolgrounds and apartment buildings, and builds their bunkers underneath civilian infrastructure and residences? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Palestinians are born anti semites so of course they&#39;re not allowed any hope, no carrot, only stick.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m genuinely curious what you think would be an appropriate solution to this conflict.</p>\n</div>",

But it's also important to note that this isn't a 100% success or 100% failure situation. Ukraine can do things to make interception harder like launching many missiles or many different types of missiles simultaneously, or targeting areas their intelligence shows are light on AA defenses. Odds are that over the remaining course of the conflict Russia will get better at intercepting ATACMS and will intercept some, but some will also get through.\n\n2. Modern warships are often rather low on armor, and high on sensitive electronics. Something like a WW2 battleship I imagine would be likely to shrug off a cluster munition attack, even DPICM, I'd imagine. My instinct is that modern warships would likely not be sunk, but might be substantially damaged, especially their sensors, by cluster munitions. Not something i know much about though.\n\n3. I think those mileage ranges are best treated as estimates, they may even be incorrect and the real ranges are likely classified. I think the ones Ukraine got were reported to be 100 miles though. It's important to note though, the maximum ranges require a longer flight time that makes interception easier, see point #1.",

And in a vacuum &quot;soldiers eating meals&quot; in a hospital seems like pretty scant proof.  A lot of soldiers end up in hospitals due to injuries, and they eat meals there.</p>\n</div>",

Israel denied responsibility for her death and blamed Palestinian militants, despite initial reports by her colleagues accusing Israeli soldiers.** Israel later claimed it was possible she had been killed by either side, and on 5 September, admitted it was likely she was \"accidentally\" hit by its forces, but refused to undertake a criminal investigation. The admission came after **investigations conducted by international news outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post concluded that she was killed by Israeli forces, with CNN finding that her death was the result of a targeted Israeli killing. Investigations by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and US State Department also found Israel responsible. Forensic Architecture refuted Israel's findings on 20 September, and said Abu Akleh was deliberately targeted and denied medical aid.** In November 2022, the US Department of Justice opened an investigation into the killing, a move that Israel condemned and refused to cooperate with. The journalist's niece Lina Abu Akleh has since been demanding the Israeli soldier responsible be held accountable.\n\n>The manner of her death and the subsequent violent disruption of her funeral drew widespread international condemnation of Israel. **During the funeral, Israeli Police officers attacked pallbearers who were carrying her coffin from the Saint Joseph Hospital in East Jerusalem with batons and stun grenades. The hospital itself was stormed by Israeli police who hit, shoved, and trampled on patients, threw stun grenades, wounding and causing burns to medical staff.**  The facility issued a statement from the Christian Churches of the Holy Land, representing 15 denominations, stating that the Israeli police's actions constituted \"invasion and disproportionate use of force ... (and) a severe violation of international norms and regulations, including the fundamental right of freedom of religion.\" Her funeral was attended by tens of thousands of Palestinians carrying flags and chanting nationalist songs. It is believed to have been the largest Palestinian funeral in Jerusalem in over twenty years.",

This deal would have been political suicide for Ehud Barak as it \u201cgave away\u201d far more than any Israeli leader had offered before.\n\nAnd yet Arafat said no. The main point of dispute was Right of Return for Palestinians displaced after they lost the 1948 war. But since this also includes their children, we\u2019re talking about 6 million predominantly Muslim Arab people who would be eligible for Israeli citizenship on top of the existing 2 million Arab Israeli citizens (compared to the 7 million Jewish Israelis), this would be fatal to the Zionist project. On top of the economic burden of integrating up to 6 million desperately poor Palestinians, Jews would become a religious minority in Israel. No Israeli government could ever agree to that.\n\nSince then, attitudes have hardened on both sides, and the PLO has lost support compared to the more hardline factions like Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Consequently, there is no realistic prospect of a peace deal any time soon.

Walls even just 15-20m from the impact site are intact, without even visible shrapnel damage..... an awning with clay roof tiles only 10m from impact *still appears to have 90% of the tiles in place*. This is in no way consistent with a large high-explosive munition going off.\n\nCould easily be a fuel (or rocket fuel fire) or a relatively small explosion of the type a typical Hamas missile makes (or a very very very small IDF munition). But its not the kind of devastation you'd need to have to kill 500 people. Its way too small.\n\nRemember that attack on Kramatorsk  last year ? Packed crowd of Ukrainains standin outside the station and on the platform, milling about to get on a train ? \n\nThat was hit by 2x Tochka-U missiles distributing cluster munitions..... 63 dead and 150 wounded. The claim here is that this explosion was near on 10x as deadly.\n\nIts just really hard to kill that many people in a single explosion (even if its massive) and this one was clearly tiny (as the footage this morning has made clear).\n\nWhatsmore, there is absolutely 0 footage of the devastation there would have to be for 500-800 dead.... bodies and wounded screaming everywhere, contents of buildings/cars strewn all over a large area, clothes and baggage and other material littering the site..... and hamas sure would have loved to video and share footage of that scene which would have been biblical in its horrifying nature. \n\nWhen the cameras get there this morning ? Clean as a whistle. Very little blood. No strewn clothing/bags/personal effects. Just approx 12 burnt out cars, one of which was flipped. No damage to the exterior of the hospital. No penetration of the structure. A crater that appars to be about the right size for a large mortar round/small artillery round/rocket but NOT a 100lb or 2000lb bomb. \n\nWhere are the 500-800 dead (and presumably 1000-2000 wounded) ? Why aren't we seeing footage of an enourmous triage site absolutely stacked with bodies/wounded and covered in blood and gore and clothes and baggage and wailing women ? \n\nAs far as I can see Hamas were absolutely and clearly lying about the casualties here if nothing else.\n\nAND..... if Hamas did immediately lie about the casualities....why do we trust their claim it was an IDF bomb ? What proof or evidence have they offered for either claim ? Why is the assumption been that there \"must\" be 500 casualties so it \"can only have been\" a big IDF bomb ? \n\nAbsolutely everything we've seen this morning is 100% consistent with a \"Ah sh*t, we screwed up badly. One of our rockets just hit the hospital. Looks like it might be bad, but we've no idea yet. Quick. Tell the presss it was the IDF, get out in front of the story. Say there are 500 casualties as it maght be really bad. Muddy the waters and we'll handle the rest in the morning.\".... and none is consistent with an IDF attack.\n\nAt the moment its Hamas' word.....entirely and completely unsupported with evidence, in a situation that should be *rife with evidence that supports their claims* that they would have easy access to and be keen to show the world.",

Consider the corridor/bridge (from the Clinton deal), controlled by Fatah, connecting the west bank and Gaza. At first this will be mostly symbolic, a few diplomats using it. Later, permits to travel between the two. It will be a symbol that yes we are serious about 2 states and not forever disempowerment. Even if two states are 20 or 50 years away make large obvious motions in that direction.</p>\n\n<p>Other ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: all of this relies upon Israel being willing to improve the lives of Palestinians, which is admittedly the most fanciful part of the outline above.</p>\n</div>",

But when the conflict finally ends in a few years, a few decades, or a few centuries, I think it will likely look something like this. The only alternative resolution I see is genocide.</p>\n</div>",
