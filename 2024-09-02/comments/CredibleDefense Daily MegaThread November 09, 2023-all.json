The program to design and manufacture the aircraft really was *extraordinarily* expensive. It also went waaaay overbudget. It's not derisively called the $1 trillion aircraft for no reason. And there really were a lot of teething problems with the aircraft related to its helmet/heads-up display, maintenance, and advertised capabilities. There were a lot of complaints about the program trying to do too many things at once, with the airframe sacrificing a second engine so that the Marine Corp STOVL capabilities could be introduced. These were all real legitimate criticisms. \n\nThey were, however, wrong to push for its cancelation or make pronouncements that it was a disaster. For one thing, the F-35 program from the very beginning integrated tons of US foreign allies, who helped chip in funding and even produced components locally (often cheaper than the US could), but even more importantly, encouraging these allies to buy lots of aircraft. The key factor in how cheap the aircraft is today is that there are just so damn many of them. As of October 2023 there were nearly 1,000 of them built already and they're being churned out like crazy at the moment, and will continue to be built at a high rate for decades to come. So cost per unit has fallen dramatically (currently between $80m and $115m  depending on model) due to efficiencies of scale. For a comparison, the 4th Generation Gripen fighter costs about $85m and the most modern variants of the F-16 cost about $65m. \n\nWhat the F-35 brings to the table though, is its capabilities. It has a significantly lower radar signature than an F-16, an insane host of technical capabilities like being able to data link with other aircraft and even missiles, advanced radar and targeting systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and more. These advanced capabilities were the cause of many of the teething problems I noted before, but the aircraft is planned to be in service for many decades and they've ironed out most of them. \n\n>Were the issues like poor maneuverability not real?\n\nI believe they are accurate to an extent. But here's the thing: it doesn't need to be hypermanueverable like the F-22.  If an F-35 is getting into knife fight range with another aircraft, things have gone terribly, horribly wrong. In dogfights with gen 4 aircraft, F-35s score kills before the other aircraft even know they're there. Lone F-35s routinely knock out entire squadrons of 4th Generation aircraft, even modern ones with advanced sensors. \n\nhttps://theaviationist.com/2019/02/16/the-first-reports-of-how-the-f-35-strutted-its-stuff-in-dogfights-against-aggressors-at-red-flag-are-starting-to-emerge/\n\n>Still confused how a single engine jet can be this popular as an air superiority role as well.\n\nTo be clear, it isn't an air superiority fighter like the F-22.

Plot twist maybe but the Israelis will be interested in showing that the bunkers under Shifa were still being used by Hamas.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military movement in this war has been interesting and unlike anything I saw before, as a former Gaza resident.

The U.S. official stressed Burns was not playing a lead role in the negotiations.Kirby confirmed that the U.S. continues to have \u201cactive discussions with partners about trying to secure the release of hostages,\u201d noting in particular Qatar\u2019s help.\n\n> \u201cWe know they have lines of communication with Hamas that we don\u2019t,\u201d Kirby said of Qatar. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to continue to work with them and regional partners to try to secure the release of all the hostages.\u201d\n\n> Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u00a0had warned Israel last week that it risked destroying an eventual possibility for peace unless it acted swiftly to\u00a0improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza\u00a0for Palestinian civilians as it intensifies its war against Hamas.\n\n> In a blunt call for Israel to pause military operations in the territory to allow for the immediate and increased delivery of assistance, Blinken said the situation would drive Palestinians toward further radicalism and effectively end prospects for any eventual resumption of peace talks to end the conflict.\n\n> French President Emmanuel Macron had opened\u00a0a Gaza aid conference\u00a0on Thursday with an appeal for Israel to protect civilians, saying that \u201call lives have equal worth\u201d and that fighting terrorism \u201ccan never be carried out without rules.\u201d\n\n> Kirby said Uzra Zeya, the State Department\u2019s under secretary for civilian security, democracy and human rights; special envoy David Satterfield; and Sarah Charles, who leads the USAID\u2019s bureau for humanitarian assistance, were representing the U.S. at the Paris conference.

It's a question that comes up in other contexts too. For example, a year ago there were widespread reports that Russians were killing and torturing Ukrainian POWs. Is Ukraine supposed to treat Russian POWs humanely while that's happening? And the general answer was yes, Ukraine was supposed to treat Russian POWs humanely regardless. Not just because it was the morally right thing to do, but also because (1) it made Russian soldiers more likely to surrender, meaning it actually helped the Ukrainian war effort, and (2) it benefited Ukraine in the court of international opinion.\n\nThis is a similar situation. As a general rule, the rules of war are focused on reason and proportionality. If someone straps babies all over themselves are charges the enemy lines, you're allowed to shoot them. If Hamas hides among the civilian population, Israel is still allowed to engage them. And Hamas is obviously violating the laws of war and morality by using human shields and in many other ways, so the reason that's not really talked about is because the answer is so clear there's little to discuss. But having one side be wrong doesn't mean the other side can do whatever it wants, and the problems mentioned above still apply to Israel.\n\nThe first one is that killing Palestinian civilians hurts Israel, because it means that the next generation of Palestinians grows up that more angry and hostile to Israel. Every effort that Israelis make today to minimize civilian casualties makes life that much easier for their children, who will likely inherit this same problem.\n\nThe second one is that killing civilians hurts Israelis in the court of international opinion. Generally speaking the Palestinians derive support in the court of public opinion from (1) the fact that they're less powerful, which makes them more sympathetic, (2) the narrative that they are oppressed by Israeli colonizers who took their land, and (3) all the people who hate Jews. Meanwhile Israel derives support from (1) the claim that they are morally superior to the Palestinians, because they commit fewer war crimes, have a better record on human rights generally, because they are a democracy, etc, (2) the idea that Jewish people are persecuted and need a place to be safe from antisemitism and (3) all the people who hate Muslims and Arabs. Every time that Israel kills a civilian, they erode their international support base because it makes them look morally closer to Palestinians, which also impacts how sympathetic people are going to feel towards Jews in point 2.\n\nSo in summary, just because one side breaks the rules doesn't excuse the other side, and in fact for most rules of war there are good practical reasons to follow them even when the other side is breaking them.

We should definitely have more Russian views in our information space, and should in fact be more welcoming and appreciative of the hard work that entails.\n\n---------------------------\n\nSince you don't object to the input of the unholy trinity of Putin, Shoigu and Medvedev, let's see what that Russian newspaper (that starts with T and ends with, uh, a word for human behind) has to say about how the war is going (https://PUT_IT_HERE/military-operation-in-ukraine):\n\n- > Russian forces strike Ukrainian troops, equipment in 118 areas over past day\n> Russian forces neutralized two Ukrainian subversive groups in the south Donetsk area over the past day\n\n- > Initial reports say 5 civilians killed in Ukraine\u2019s missile strike on Kherson Region city\n> \"According to preliminary information, 15 people were injured, of whom five have died, and 10 were hospitalized to the central regional clinic of Skadovsk,\" the press service specified\n\n- > Russian forces destroy US-made howitzer, amassed Ukrainian troops in Kherson area\n> The Russian battlegroup\u2019s strikes killed 46 and wounded two Ukrainian soldiers\n\n- > Kiev destroyed 3,500 civilian infrastructure facilities since 2022 \u2014 Russian envoy to UN\n> Since February 2022, the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic alone has been subjected to more than 25,000 artillery and missile strikes by Ukrainian armed forces, Vasily Nebenzya said\n\n- > Strike on Donetsk, other similar crimes prove that special op was justified \u2013 diplomat\n> According to the Russian permanent representative to the UN, Moscow has no other way to stop Kyiv\n\n- > Kiev consults with West on targets for strikes, including civilian facilities \u2013 diplomat\n> According to Russia's permanent representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzi, most attacks use long-range, high-precision Western weapons\n\n- > Ukraine violated international humanitarian law by striking Donetsk \u2013 Russia\u2019s UN envoy\n> Russia's permanent representative to the UN believes that this is \"new evidence of deliberate actions to exterminate the civilian population of Donbass\"\n\n- > Ukraine strikes hospital in central Donetsk \u2014 officials\n> Work is reportedly underway to see if anyone was hurt\n\n- > Russian forces wipe out Ukrainian command post in Zaporozhye area over past day\n> It is also reported that the Russian military inflicted damage on Ukrainian army units in the Krasny Liman area, eliminating roughly 60 enemy troops over the past day\n\n- > Number of casualties in Ukrainian shelling of Donetsk on November 7 up to 55\n> According to the acting Heath Minister of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, three children were among the injured, while three more people are in serious condition\n\n- > Russian forces destroy amassed Ukrainian troops in Kherson area over past day\n> Russian troops wiped out a Ukrainian 120mm mortar with its team and ammunition in the island zone and an enemy D-30 howitzer with ammunition in the Kakhovka direction\n\n- > Kiev resorting to terror with hits on Russian nuclear power plants \u2014 top security official\n> \"A lack of success on the battlefield is making Kiev step up the use of terrorist methods, including assassination attempts against and killings of Russian citizens, attacks on civilian facilities and critical infrastructure,\" Nikolay Patrushev pointed out\n\netc.\n\nNow, *WOW*, does Ukraine do *anything* other than lose badly and murder civilians, and does Russia do *anything* other than absolutely smashing it in the righteous fight against 'The Gnarly, Mischieving West'? How could Ukraine wittingly do this to both its own and Russian citizens? Sue for peace!\n\n**I, for one, am absolutely flabbergasted that an increasingly militarized dictatorship would ever write so candidly about the horrors of the war!**\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nBy the way, did you hear about the Ukrainian Nazis and the rise of the, uh, 'problematic right'? Oh, I could talk all day about it. In fact, *let's* talk about it, **all day**. Here, you can get up to speed here at that other sub - set the search query for 'nazi' (**can't link to it unfortunately**, but you know it).\n\nIf you need some more official sounding sources, here's some of That Russian newspaper again on that issue:\n\n- > Ukrainian parliament recognizes Nazi collaborators as 'combat veterans'\n> Ukraine\u2019s Verkhovna Rada has recognized WWII-era collaborators with the Third Reich, who carried out atrocities and participated in the Holocaust, as \u2018combat veterans\u2019\n\n- > Zelensky's applause for fascist confirms Kiev's Nazi ideology \u2014 Kremlin\n> \"Of course, we can only sympathize with the memory of Ukrainian veterans who fought against fascism, including Zelensky's grandfather,\" Dmitry Peskov pointed out\n\n- > German authorities downplaying role of neo-Nazis in Ukraine \u2014 Bundestag member\n> According to Sevim Dagdelen, the attacks on Russian borderline have been carried out by \"units linked to the Ukrainian army, which the German government has been arming on a massive scale\" \n\n- > Poles horrified at Ukraine\u2019s glorification of Nazi quisling, says community leader\n> Leader of the Polish Association of Kresy Residents Andrzej Korzeniowski reacted to the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s decision to celebrate the birthday of Stepan Bandera\nUkrainian nationalist carries a portrait of Stepan Bandera AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky\n\netc.\n\n---------------------------\n\nEver hear of the conscription problems the Ukrainian army is having? **Not really talked about in here**, which is a shame, **as we really should**.
