To get that far alone has to have meant burning resources you may not get back, and, knowing that Russia will undoubtedly tighten its security once you strike, you may not get this chance again. You're in an unprecedented position to strike at the Russian psyche. Then you blow all that work, your big opportunity, on some out-of-favor intellectual? To what?

However, correlation does not imply causation, nor do Dugin's views always translate into Russian policy either. But it seems to happen often enough that Dugin is given a sense of preeminence, even though realistically he is hardly the only thinker ascribing his views. Third, Dugin maintains ties to the far right in the West, so he gets an increased prominence in the Western view thanks to that connection. Talk about the Western far right and Russia and Dugin will probably come up. So he's well positioned to be this sort of Russian philosophical bogeyman, the mastermind behind Russian evils.

I'm in no mood to do full transcription and translation of his rant, get some AI for that if you want. The opening part, IMO, is making his position most clear: \n\n> These fallen heroes have already made their decision; they have fallen for the liberty of the Southeast from the Neo-Nazi Kievan scum. Frankly I think that to be an Ukrainian today, after this, is shameful. I'm Ukrainian myself, you know \u2013 I have some of that blood, my ancestors hail from Poltava, and I'm ashamed, simply ashamed for that minor but still significant share of my blood. **And I want that blood to be redeemed by [letting] the blood of the scum, of the Kievan Junta. And I truthfully cannot bear to carry that Ukrainian blood in me until I see the bastards who have been committing lawless acts on May 2nd executed.** This is serious. This is the voice of blood.\n\nThen he talks about the \u00abscum\u00bb having demonstrated the absence of moral right to rule even the Western Ukraine, nevermind Southeast, and about a minute after that he begins blathering that Ukrainian Hungarians, Carpathians and even ethnic Ukrainians proper must begin a massive rebellion against the \u00abJunta\u00bb lest they get exterminated in their turn by insane AmeroKievan Nazis.\n\nAll in all, he was just strongly rattled by Odessa. In Western sources it's presented as some kind of an unfortunate accident, but in Russia it's seen as a... I don't know a real parallel. Imagine some Rust Belt Republicans watching Fox news where Californians first secede on grounds of their racial superiority, and then **fucking burn alive** a peaceful rally of loud-mouthed Trump supporters: that's how it's seen, and that's how it colors the entire conflict. It's not *exactly* true, of course. But that's what Dugin believes had happened.\n\nThis is the context that's cut off to leave the \u00abI believe: Kill, kill and kill, no more talks. That's what I'm thinking as a professor\u00bb part. You're literally participating in [this meme](https://9gag.com/gag/aqmV5A7). \n\nOff topic but it surprises me that you seem to accept uncritically that Ukrainians you meet online are more honest than Russian Zombies and don't gratuitously distort truth for their good cause. This is Eastern Europe. It can only appear enlightened and civilized by focusing on the barbarity of Serbs and Russians, and that only from a safe distance, deep in Elfin lands.",

Getting in the National Assembly isn't enough to say that one is equally or more electable than MLP: Jean-Marie also got elected there, and no one in their right mind would deny that he was less electable than Marine is now.\n\nMarine got a decent chunk of LFI protest votes, where the softer-than-her-party image (especially on economic policies and immigration) was very helpful in reducing the disgust/reluctance that leftists usually have towards RN. And that's what I don't see MM getting, not unless she climbs down from the Zemmour power levels. See, towards the 1st round, Zemmour polled at 30-35 percent vs. Macron in hypothetical 2nd round matchups; for most of the time, at least based on the polls, Marine Le Pen was the most electable opposition candidate against Macron. Like, the reason why she got as far as she did was that she had *some* appeal *outside* the far right.\n\nSo yeah, the main basis for my opinion is that if she is roughly aligned with Zemmour, she would probably not get significantly more support than Zemmour did.

Getting in the National Assembly isn&#39;t enough to say that one is equally or more electable than MLP: Jean-Marie also got elected there, and no one in their right mind would deny that he was less electable than Marine is now.</p>\n\n<p>Marine got a decent chunk of LFI protest votes, where the softer-than-her-party image (especially on economic policies and immigration) was very helpful in reducing the disgust/reluctance that leftists usually have towards RN. And that&#39;s what I don&#39;t see MM getting, not unless she climbs down from the Zemmour power levels. See, towards the 1st round, Zemmour polled at 30-35 percent vs. Macron in hypothetical 2nd round matchups; for most of the time, at least based on the polls, Marine Le Pen was the most electable opposition candidate against Macron. Like, the reason why she got as far as she did was that she had <em>some</em> appeal <em>outside</em> the far right.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, the main basis for my opinion is that if she is roughly aligned with Zemmour, she would probably not get significantly more support than Zemmour did. And based on polling close to the 1st round, Zemmour was definitely less electable than MLP.</p>\n</div>",

Light mortars are typically considered to be under 80mm. These are small light weight man portable weapons. The US M224A1 is ~37.5lbs/17kg for the system, without munitions. Range on light weight mortars is typically less than 4,000 yards/3650m, rate of fire is however fast the mortar crew can fire it.  Generally speaking there isn't enough rounds for any sort of sustained fire. Newer systems are generally lighter. \n\nMedium mortars are typically around 80mm, these are still typically man portable systems. Range is typically less than 8,000 yards/7300m. The US M252 is ~90lbs/40kg for the system without munitions. Rate of fire is typically a little lower, but still dependent on how fast the mortar crew can fire it. Again, newer systems are typically lighter.\n\nIf you can sense a trend then you can probably already guess about 120mm mortars. 120mm mortars are typically mounted on a carriage, or mounted on a vehicle. Often times vehicle mounted units can be displaced from the vehicle. Various guided 120mm rounds exist, I don't believe any do in smaller calibers apart from development. \n\nRussia, AFAIK, doesn't use any light weight mortars. Haven't since WW2. Russia has more heavy weight mortars than any other country, including a handful of breech-loading 240mm 2S4s. Both Ukraine and Russia have been using 2B9 gun-mortars, a breech-loading 82mm fed by 4 round clips capable of direct fire.",

It's important to remember that the Spetsnaz are, unlike Delta or SAS or what have you, are a pretty wide ranging group of different units with various specialties and tasks.  \n\n\nFirst, Spetsnaz elements definitely formed spearheads alongside the VDV for major assaults early in the war. That's consistent with previous Russian military behavior in Chechnya and the intervention in Kazakhstan (and Georgia as well I believe, but I'm not sure). For example, we know for a fact that the 45th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade was present at the fighting around Hostomel.  From what we know Spetsnaz units continue to form the leading edges of assaults across the frontline. Plenty of RumInt and OSInt confirming them operating near the front, calling in artillery, fighting as spearheads, etc. This is the stuff that is consuming the majority of Spetsnaz forces in Ukraine. There was a recent report (not sure if it was confirmed) about a week ago that a Spetsnaz led column had blundered into Kharkiv and got shot up pretty bad, so they're out there.\n\nSecond, there may have been pre-placed infiltration units of Spetsnaz in Kyiv and other major cities near the invasion routes. There were rumors of saboteur and hit squads running around early on, but it's unclear if those squads existed and if they were Spetsnaz (though it would follow that they were). Zelensky claimed as much I believe, earlier on in the war, specifically that Spetsnaz in plainclothes were trying to hunt down and kill/capture politicians and administrators. It would make sense for Spetsnaz elements to be deployed in this manner, though I doubt we'll get a really solid confirmation on the presence of saboteurs like this for some time though. If anyone has something, I'd be interested to see it.  \n\n\nThird, the Spetsnaz are being used as infiltrators and raiders along the frontline. We know this from some combat footage/propaganda stuff that's circulating online. Also it just makes sense that they would be used in this role. Pretty much tied to their presence as frontline elites.  \n\n\nFourth, Spetsnaz are forming backline policing and anti-insurrectionist units. This is much harder to track, but it is in keeping with their previous usage in conflicts.  I assume this is where a fair amount of the real stereotypical hardcore Spetsnaz GRU boys are being used (pure speculation).",

They blamed it all on artillery, but it was much greater than that, since they didn&#39;t exactly avoid those bloody battles in any way. </p>\n\n<p>If UAF still had the capabilities to pull off a legit doctrinal maneuver defense, COMBLOC speak for a very mobile defense in depth, they could put a big hurting on the Russians to take advantage of their impatience.  But I don&#39;t think they can do it now, that takes skilled troops with lots of discipline, plus a very good company to field grade officer corps who are well trained in maneuver warfare, though those have taken very heavy casualties at this point.</p>\n</div>",
