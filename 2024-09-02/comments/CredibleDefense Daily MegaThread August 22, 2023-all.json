Similarly, the Russians have committed their reserves. The critical remaining question is which side will win a \"contest of wills\" as the committed units attrite each other until one or both sides exhaust their available combat power.\n- He continues to see progress on Bakhmut flanks, but says it hasn't been super fast, which makes sense because it is a secondary effort without any clear strategic objectives.\n- At this point, he thinks essentially all of the available Ukrainian units for the offensive have been committed to the line at one point or another so far. Meaning there is probably not a large reserve of combat power that has still been withheld from combat.\n- Russian active/elastic defense has been happening farther forward than we might have expected, in front of rather than behind the newly built fortified lines. Kofman sees this as emblematic of Russian risk appetite. \n- Kofman certainly has some reservations about [the recently leaked casualty figures reported by the NYTimes in this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/ukraine-russia-war-casualties.html), and [as discussed on this thread a few days ago here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15uimh0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_18_2023/jwqaz73/), and with [a similar WaPo article providing a bleak assessment of the counteroffensive's outlook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/17/ukraine-counteroffensive-melitopol/).\n- To some extent, these and similar articles may be attributable to analysts getting more pessimistic about the offensive, which Kofman thinks is fair because he has also become more pessimistic.\n- Kofman's concerns about the casualty figures reflect many expressed by some of us on the daily mega thread here. Specifically he thinks the \"structure\" of the numbers doesn't make sense. He doesn't elucidate exactly what he means by structure, but he probably means the KIA/WIA ratios, Ru-Ukr loss ratios, and the absence of estimate intervals all combine to make the estimates difficult to interpret, [similar to what I described here on that previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15uimh0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_18_2023/jwqv74q/)). Kofman also called out that it is difficult to interpret estimates in the absence of confidence levels and ranges.\n-  Kofman stated that he does not know exactly why people are leaking this information right now, but speculated that it may have to do with people maneuvering in advance to shift blame for the offensive failing if it doesn't end up making any strategically significant gains. (Hence the WaPo article reporting US officials accusing the Ukrainians of being timid and not taking enough risk and the NYTimes article reporting casualties have been high. Probably one leak was meant to counter the other.) \n- Kofman doesn't think Ukraine is being too conservative, but rather is struggling to coordinate larger scale maneuvers. He suggests US analysts may be too disconnected from the on the ground realities and are misunderstanding how Ukrainian forces operate.\n- However, he identifies two criticisms that may be true but which we will not be able to assess until some weeks in the future. First, UAF distribution of forces allocates a disproportionate number of its most experienced units to a secondary axis around Bakhmut. Second, planning iteration, i.e. the ability of the military planning staff to adapt to changing circumstances on the battlefield. That is hard to assess in media res, but he thinks whether it is happening now will be determinative in terms of the offensive's chances for success. ([I made a similar point here a few weeks ago, coincidentally while bashing Kofman's arguments on a related topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15b009w/credibledefense_daily_megathread_july_27_2023/jtr4q68/), i.e. that we should be looking for Ukrainian adaptation as a leading indicator of their ability to succeed in this or future offensives, rather than expecting them to achieve success by fighting in any particular way that we in the west would fight.)\n- They then discuss the Black Sea and the potential for an outer blockade by Russia, but Kofman notes that unrestricted warfare brings enormous risks in terms of drawing in other parties to the conflict and negative international policy consequences. (He doesn't mention it but Russia also has much greater volumes of civilian shipping at risk in the Black Sea and so they may not want to open up the opportunity for Ukraine to respond in kind). He notes that Russia is basically trying to create an effective blockade by increasing insurance costs to prohibitive levels without having to actually enforce a close blockade.",

                "body": "> This time he says that is a big unfair criticism. \n\nI think he meant that the expectations that the Ukrainians should fight more aggressively and that they should concentrate their forces within an operational direction (i.e. massing for assaults tactically, as opposed to allocating brigades operationally) are unfair, but thinks it might be fair to say Ukraine should have allocated its more experienced troops toward its primary offensive operational direction rather than the secondary efforts around Bakhmut. Meaning the Ukrainians misallocated their forces in terms of combat power even if not in terms of raw numbers of brigades committed. Which admittedly does seem to be walked back a bit from the perspective he offered a few weeks ago, where he was critical even of the distribution of forces across the three axes in the south, but overall I think his argument is still largely consistent.\n\nCurrently, the Ukrainians are conducting assaults across a broad stretch of the front with relatively small, diffused units, alternating between dismounted infantry assaults and small scale mechanized breaches while conducting extensive deep strike operations to attrite enemy logistics. Kofman and the WaPo sources take issue with this approach for differing reasons, but personally I think they are all getting the causality a bit backwards. Kofman thinks Ukraine is fighting in small units because that's all they are capable of doing given their training and experience level. The WaPo sources think that the Ukrainians are spread out because the UAF GenStab have just decided that is the better strategy for their purposes, possibly because of politically driven loss sensitivity. Yet I don't think these features of Ukrainian operations are choices, but rather they are inevitable consequences of how closely drones monitor the battlespace. Neither side can afford to mass in battalion or above groupings because they will 100% be spotted and targeted well before they can even approach enemy positions. Thus, they fight in smaller units. Reducing force density to avoid detection and targeting also means the same unit will occupy more physical space than it otherwise would, contributing to the relatively diffused offensive efforts we have been seeing.\n\nSo Kofman wants the Ukrainians to learn to coordinate in larger units better so they can concentrate their forces more. The Ukrainians themselves want more weapons and support for offensives. And the unnamed US defense officials from the WaPo article want the Ukrainians to skip ahead straight to concentrating their forces during assaults immediately, without any further enablers in place. But what if massing for assaults simply is not survivable under the current conditions, regardless of training, experience, equipment, or willingness to incur losses? I think in that case you'd probably end up fighting exactly how the Ukrainians are fighting now.",

It&#39;s not combined arms, but it&#39;s a damn sight better than what they&#39;re doing now.</p>\n</div>",

It will also examine whether the relation between the company and the government needs to be reformed, the ministry said in a statement on Monday.\n\n>Ruag wanted to sell the non-operational Leopard I tanks to Rheinmetall, which planned to refurbish them and send them to Ukraine, but Swiss authorities stopped the deal in June. The tanks had originally been bought in Italy in 2016 and left in storage there, but \u201cincoherences\u201d have emerged over the purchase, according to the statement.\n\n>Neutrality in Focus\n\n>With national elections coming up in October, the affair could put the theme of Switzerland\u2019s traditional neutrality further into focus.\n\n>Ruag\u2019s former chief executive officer, Brigitte Beck, had to step down after suggesting that European countries should go ahead and send Swiss-made arms to Ukraine, as Switzerland wouldn\u2019t do much about it. Her successor, Nicolas Perrin, said the country would have to rethink its international stance \u201cin an increasingly connected world.\u201d\n\n>This prompted the right-wing Swiss People\u2019s Party, the strongest force in parliament, to respond by saying that Switzerland enjoys peace and stability only through neutrality, and that the doctrine is non-negotiable. The SVP has repeatedly targeted Defense Minister Viola Amherd, from the centrist Mitte party, for failing to exercise oversight over Ruag. \n\nDoes anyone have a better read on this? \n\nRUAG had signed an agreement with Rheinmetall contingent on approval of the Swiss government, which once it didn't get called the deal off. I'm not sure exactly what there is to investigate with that unless they were directed not to and did anyway. \n\nThis feels like politics, but what is strange to me is the investigation into the 2016 purchase. I'm not sure exactly what even a political investigation would be looking for. Perhaps a backroom deal with a handshake agreement to sell them to Rheinmetall later? But that was in 2016, which would make Rheinmetall want to purchase  an obsolete tank platform at some time in the future strangely prescient. \n\nOr is it some backdoor way of nullifying the original purchase and sending them back to Italy, which then they could be supplied? I highly doubt it, but if the Swiss government was looking for a technicality to maintain their neutral image that could be it.

Or it is intended to operate autonomously when submerged and only maintains the command link until it is close to a target and needs to submerge to avoid detection, after which it is autonomously guided.

This is an average across models and many flights. A plane might come back, get an inspection which finds no issues and be ready to go with just a couple man hours spent. Other times it will be a major inspection and maintenance milestone or there may be an issue requiring major work.\n\n>Would it be possible for ukrainians to only handle rearming and refueling and for a plane to go to Poland for repair?\n\nYes, but they'll want to at least be doing some maintenance and repairs on site. It is a major operation to take the wings and engine off, and put it on a train for Poland. You probably don't want to do that just because something minor is wrong.

This is an average across models and many flights. A plane might come back, get an inspection which finds no issues and be ready to go with just a couple man hours spent. Other times it will be a major inspection and maintenance milestone or there may be an issue requiring major work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would it be possible for ukrainians to only handle rearming and refueling and for a plane to go to Poland for repair?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but they&#39;ll want to at least be doing some maintenance and repairs on site. It is a major operation to take the wings and engine off, and put it on a train for Poland. You probably don&#39;t want to do that just because something minor is wrong. Where exactly that line gets drawn is something for greater experts than I.</p>\n</div>",

Maybe it's because I didn't communicate clearly enough.\n\nYou've focused a lot on the first sentence of my original post. But I think the rest of the post, and the post I was responding to, lends some context.\n\nThe OP basically asked \"Is the US going to transition away from carriers given that they can be killed by drone swarms that are far less expensive than aircraft carriers?\" Now as you mentioned, drone swarms don't exist yet, but it's plausible they will in the fairly near future, and that they will, as hypothesized by the OP, be able to kill carriers for a fraction of the price. The OP seemed to suggest that this would be a new development since aircraft carriers were currently \"unsinkable.\"\n\nSo the point that I was making in my response to that is that aircraft carriers aren't unsinkable. There are already things that can kill carriers, like land based aircraft and anti-ship missiles. If drones or drone swarms are a new thing that can destroy a carrier, that's just a new thing to add to the list that carriers need to be concerned about, not a situation where carriers have suddenly stopped being \"unsinkable,\" as if they were some unstoppable superweapon until drones showed up.\n\nThat's the point of my statement that carriers will \"always be defeated by other things for a fraction of their cost,\" which I will admit can be interpreted multiple ways. Not that every time the Gerald Ford goes head to head with a B-29 the B-29 will win just because it happens to be a land based aircraft, which seems to be what you've interpreted me as saying, but rather that aircraft carriers will always be at a disadvantage, which is because the aircraft they can launch are more limited than land based aircraft and the costs of building and maintaining them (and their accompanying fleet) will always be much higher than a comparable airfield, or even several comparable airfields. And they're harder to repair. These disadvantages aren't going away.\n\nAnd as you'll note the rest of my post addressed why people make aircraft carriers anyway, even though they aren't unstoppable superweapons - it's because they allow you to project power abroad. This doesn't seem controversial to me. You note that they are good at hunting at sea, but that's still projecting power. And if you aren't projecting power, say if you are defending your country while it's being invaded, then an aircraft carrier isn't terribly well suited for it's task. You would be better off with the many airstrips and other things you could build for the same price as the carrier, which would additionally be able to field a wider variety of aircraft. But if you do want to do something that's out of range of your airstrips, then carriers are obviously very useful, and more flexible than building a new airstrip anywhere you want to project power (which isn't necessarily an option if the area is the middle of the ocean), which is where the flexible part of my description came from.",

But the time your dinky toys have a warhead big enough to make a scratch, enough speed to catch a carrier enough range to matter, you have just invented a slow speed cruise missile with extra steps.</p>\n\n<p>You will be sat there gurning on winning at internet and not realise you haven&#39;t event thought about how big a warhead you&#39;d need.</p>\n</div>",
