Turkey absolutely can't just pull out of Syria. That can't happen. Syrians in Turkey would riot and there would be a catastrophe on the border as the regime begins offensive operations to take Idlib and Northern Aleppo. You may even have armed groups assault the border themselves if the Turks were to shut it. If they leave it open, several million people may flee, compounding an already difficult situation inside Turkey.\n\n2. Even just these talks are likely to result in protests or riots within northern Syria. While there are a few groups in the north that are pretty tightly under the Turkish thumb (despite their often highly problematic nature), there are more still that have retained most of their autonomy despite working with the Turks. These groups will drift away from the Turks if they truly feel like they are being backstabbed. \n\n3. Hayat Tahrir al Sham, formerly Jabhat Fatah al Sham, formerly Jabhat al Nusra, are likely to consolidate their control and may in turn grow more anti-Turkey if there are credible reports that the Turks are planning to sell the rebels out, or even the suspicion of a closer relationship with Assad. HTS currently maintains a rocky relationship with the Turks (who mostly leave them alone and allow trade), but such drama could result in HTS moving to overpower Turkish-controlled factions in northern Aleppo, which they could do relatively quickly and likely with acceptable casualties.\n\nMy expectation is that the Turks will not give up their occupied zones, but will work to slowly reopen Syria to trade options while at the same time undercutting any efforts by the US-aligned Syrian Democratic Forces to foster a better relationship with Damascus. Any big political changes though could have large fallout.",

It was almost 8000 barrels they had removed during that period of time covered by the last CC video. \n\nBut there's an important caveat: >28% of those tubes were mortars. They were virtually all gone from storage already back then. That means, if we look strictly at indirect fire guns they were using in Ukraine (this excludes the MT-12 and the M-46), they actually took out only 4688 guns or 46% of their total stock. \n\nIn simpler terms, they were taking out very close to 25% of their pre-invasion stock per year (~2500 guns), on average. But that was during a period when they were either firing a lot more shells (wearing down the barrels a lot faster), giving them out to PMCs and Ukraine didn't have massive shell shortages (I presume the winter 2023 shortage was temporary and then artificial because they fired a ton during their offensive without having received significant shipments in the weeks prior).\n\nIn other words, we should expect that ~2500/year consumption rate to reduce if that was the only factors in play. But it's not: \n\n* The losses from drones have increased significantly (on both sides, but Russian losses more so)\n* There was an extended Ukrainian shell shortage for about 5 months (it must have affected counter-battery fire)\n* Russia got 130mm shells and re-activated the M-46\n* Russian rate of fire is much lower than it was during the period covered by the CC video\n* The remaining towed artillery have a shorter range, so they're more vulnerable to counter-battery fire\n\nIt's hard to assess how all these factors have affected the rate of losses Russians suffered, but the numbers provided by Vischun Military give us a hint IMO: in the bases for which we have recent images, we should be able to estimate the rate of consumption for 2024 - I say should, because [the 7015th went from 0 guns in CC's video](https://x.com/HighMarsed/status/1777382686186745902) to apparently 131...maybe there's a mistake here somewhere or they moved some guns around:\n\n* 80th: 826 guns/year\n* 120th: 173\n* 243rd: 82\n* others: 566 (big caveat, I have used the CC date for the 7015th base, that's the only date I have, but I would need the one for the 216th arsenal to be accurate)\n* 7020th: 11\n* 109th: 115\n* 94th: 30\n\nThose are (ordered from biggest to smallest base/depot), the ones we have recent images of. The period covered is 4-7 months for all of them except the 7020th: 12 months. I annualized the consumption rate for each base. An important caveat: the numbers above assume all the guns removed are howitzers, but there were MT-12s left in the CC video, [some ~15% in Lesnoi Gorodok](https://x.com/HighMarsed/status/1788151905899680239), but IDK where the rest are.\n\nAs mentioned before, those represent only 32.8% of the 2023 stock and they removed guns at a rate of 1804 guns per year (922 guns in reality, over a weighted period of 6.3 months between images). If that rate applies proportionally to the other 2 bases (Shchuchye and Lesnoi Gorodok), **we're looking at a rate of 5 500 guns per year** (or perhaps 5000 if we apply a fudge factor due to the MT-12s). If you're curious, those are the rates found for these 2 bases:\n\n* Shchuchye: 658 guns/year over the period of July-December 2023\n* Lesnoi Gorodok: 822 guns/year over the period of January-March 2024\n\nWith approximately 4500 howitzers left, in apparent good condition, in that imagery (and probably closer to 4000 in reality), I'm still estimating that Russia will run out of towed artillery in reserve in the first half of 2025, as long as Ukraine is able to maintain a similar rate of destruction.",

Other elements are important too, but their current doctrine doesn't allow them to do either successfully without artillery.\n\nTheir only reserves of quality long-range tube artillery is in the form of SPGs, they must be  completely out of 2A36 and 2A65 reserves (getting images is only a formality IMO) which leaves them with medium-range howitzers like D-1/-20/-30 and M-30/-46. \n\n> long range artillery has disabled or destroyed way more tanks, than tanks have ever done the same to artillery\n\nI'd go further: long range artillery has destroyed more tanks in Ukraine than tanks did. Since the last 2 years, it seems exceedingly rare that tanks from both sides manage to get close enough to battle: mines, artillery and drones will destroy one or the other before they meet.\n\n> losing the artillery advantage by having worse / less / lower quality guns seems more important as it should have a spiraling effect of bringing the older models in closer to enemy long range fires and cheaper drones\n\nI think that's part of the reason why there's such a big gap between the rate of re-activation we get straight from the data provided (3283 guns/year) and the much higher rate from bases that have recent imagery (5500 guns/year if extrapolated to the entire stock).

        "body": "The subject has come up a few times recently on this sub, and I saw some Twitter posts on it too, so I figured I'd share my thoughts on using light vehicles for assault in Ukraine.\n\nI'm surprised I'm saying this, but I think IN THIS WAR ONLY, and AT THIS TIME ONLY, dirt bikes and Chinese UTVs (akin to a WW2 American Jeep in terms of performance) are pretty effective for conducting assaults. \n\nThat sounds counterintuitive and even comedic but remember this is the same war where barely trained dismounted assault infantry are regularly conducting kilometers long foot movements to then perform successful attacks, often in open terrain, during daylight, with little to no smoke for obscuration, and that's working so well it's become routine.  \n\nLike the dirt bike assault, the long range dismounted assault should lead to mass slaughter, that's what history says, that's what most modern doctrine says, that's what common sense seems to say. But alas, because this is a very unique war. \n\nTactically, due to various reasons, the only viable means of making territorial gains are small unit (platoon sized and under) bite and hold attacks against enemy outpost positions that are typically held with a fire team elements. \n\nThose attacks usually only need a squad plus of assault troops because those small outpost positions are ridiculously dispersed kilometers apart from each other (so rarely mutually supporting), often poorly built, and manned by barely trained 40-50 year olds, who might have good morale but often don't. While they might have reliable comms with their higher HQ (though that'll often be disrupted by EW), they'll tend to have almost no coordination with left right adjacent units (commonly stated complaint among the UAF), which means gaps aplenty to exploit. It's the exact opposite of a textbook defensive position designed to stop infantry.\n\nThe defender's greatest strength is that they're part of a greater defensive network, in significant depth, tied into a complex drone directed command/control and fires system. And that's where the dirt bikes/UTVs come in handy. \n\nFor the attacker, due to the proliferation of drones, armored fighting vehicles such as dedicated engineering vehicles for breaching, tanks, APCs, IFVs, must usually be located many kilometers to the rear of the zero line, especially in platoon strength or larger. Meaning any attack launched with AFV must move from an assembly area deep in the tactical rear, as far back as 10-12 kilometers in some cases (and that's often doctrine too). After assembling, the AFVs must drive down extremely heavily drone patrolled routes well known to defenders because of off-road issues and the AT mine threat, made worse for them due to the static nature of positional warfare, where well trained/educated officers on the defense have plenty of time for quality terrain analysis to identify avenues of approach, which will be prioritized with recon assets and defense positions. \n\nThe AFV approach march is already going to be exposed for a very long time, but it'll be even slower when using a mine plow/roller, which the first AFV in the column typically must use, as that'll reduce the column speed to under 20 km/h, making them more vulnerable. At which point basically every available weapon systems that operate as part of a defensive system, nearly entirely designed to repel armored threats, will start engaging them. Everyone even casually watching combat footage of this war knows exactly what that looks like, it's very costly in manpower and equipment.\n\nDismounted infantry attacks, even when moving multiple kilometers to the objective, must have a high success rate to make them preferable to AFV centric attacks, as they are often chosen by tactical commanders in lieu of AFV attacks, with lots of anecdotal reports of their greater success. This is known for both sides, and it's the greatest indicator that the outpost line of defenses are not meant to stop dismounted attacks, which are actually their weakness.\n\nThe way things are set up defensively (a different discussion altogether), a small unit dismounted attack has a decent chance of success to arrive at the enemy outpost positions with surprise, with enough fighting power and cohesion to take the position. Especially with a short jump off location, moving at dark, or moving through obstructed terrain providing cover and concealment.\n\nHowever, the risk of mission failure and turning into a mass casualty event becomes much greater when making multi kilometer foot movements, or in broad daylight, or along heavily drone patrolled routes, or all of the above. And if dismounted elements are spotted during the approach march, they're very easy to wound/kill because they're slow moving and extremely vulnerable. \n\nAnd that's where light, fast, agile, off-road vehicles come to the rescue. Dismounted infantry crossing kilometers of open ground (like the UAF did all last summer) can do that quickly, travelling on routes that the AFV often can't or won't. They can remain more dispersed during the movement, which can often have a shorter route as small dirt bikes/UTVs are easier to infiltrate to near the zero line and hide in advance, giving a very short jump off location to the enemy, helping provide tactical surprise.\n\nThey're unarmored, but so what? It's not like an MTL-B or BMP-1 is very survivable either for most of what's available to hit them. And in terms of basic math, a single lost IFV can mean a full squad is lost too, but a single motorcycle lost only means a maximum of 2 pax lost, while a single UTV means a maximum of 4 pax lost. \n\nI'm sure a lack of APC/IFV had something to do with Russian forces being issued light vehicles in the first place and being told to figure out a way to use them. But I also think that experienced assault units might actually prefer light vehicles to AFV and especially walking. \n\nIf it's stupid but works, it's not stupid.",

Both sides have a great lack of well trained small unit leaders, and when they do exist their expertise isn't doctrinal tactics, it's knowing the ins and outs of what they do on a regular basis (on-the-job training). So if their unit hasn't laid c-wire properly and regularly in the past, their leadership doesn't know how. \n\nLaying c-wire is also time consuming and manpower intensive, making it a greater danger to troops manning the zero line due to enemy drone observation, snipers, and enemy ground observers. They already have issues just digging in and improving their own positions, if they also have to lay c-wire that'll increase the risk of being exposed, spotted, and engaged.\n\nThere is probably a supply issue too, they'd need to haul rolls of balky and annoyingly sharp c-wire, as well as needing special gloves, stakes, mallets/hammers. It's not unduly heavy, but it's weight they don't want to carry. Most troops even in high quality western armies hate laying c-wire, it's not fun and made worse when you might die doing it.\n\nThe survivability of c-wire against heavy fires would also be an issue. Lots of the forward outpost positions are hit repeatedly before an attack commences. C-wire might not survive it, so it doesn't help the defender during an attack, and later requires it to be repaired/relaid, with resulting issues.\n\nThere is also the issue of giving away the position. While there is great benefit to laying c-wire in the interior edge of a treeline where defensive positions are often situated, if they're put further out in the open area of a field, to trap the attackers trying to deal with the wire, that'll further give away where the defensive positions are located. If they're found, they're targeted.\n\nDefenses are highly dispersed but survivable because they're relying on concealment as their chief advantage. The attacker might know or have a hunch where the platoon plus sized strongpoints are located, but outpost positions can be anywhere, and change on a regular basis (likely during most rotations).

Increase drone coverage, make them more resistant to EW,, simplify logistics, solve planning and coordination issues, and the front line infantry can be made up of eight year olds with nerf guns and it won&#39;t matter. </p>\n\n<p>That seems to be the trend of how things are progressing anyway, it&#39;s why using garbage infantry and not enough there hasn&#39;t had disastrous repercussions yet. The defending infantry positions are basically sensors at this point to populate interactive fire network software to define where the lines are on a map, and to detect where an enemy attack is happening so drone directed fires can respond.</p>\n</div>",

Not too hard with dismounts, harder for armor and why firing at them with arty is most common when they're stuck at obstacles or brought under other fires. Very hard to know where a dispersed group of dirt bikes will be minutes later. \n\nI don't think it's just the top speed that the dirt bikes possess that makes them useful, it's their quick acceleration, their small size allowing them to traverse tighter terrain (including driving through treelines), etc. But yeah, any halfway decent set of obstacles that'll stop AFV will stop them too.
