      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

A commodity exporting country can be surprisingly stable if they can manage the population. In turn, that government can then do what it's wants, e.g. expanding their empire with wars of conquest.\n\nI am pretty pessimistic about energy transition, especially for countries that will now buy oil and gas products from Russia. So on shorter term it depends on the ability of the west to disrupt those flows. On longer term, but eventually on the longer term the ability to sell those products will dwindle, Russia will need to replace those with other commodities, but it's the question of those can raise the same level of profits as oil and gas.\n\nSecurity and defense wise Russia also has options left, they can redirect funds to the defense industry or buy weapons from countries China, especially when this war ends or is frozen, etc. Iran and North-Korea show that it's possible to have a weak economy, but still be highly militarized. \n\nThe main problem is that Russia is a country that looks always outwards for their internal security and stability. In their zero-sum game mindset, neighboring countries or the west cannot win, because that would mean Russia automatically is the losing party. As a country protecting itself with nuclear weapons, is still a significant threat for neighboring countries and the west. It would therefor be wrong to bet on the downfall of Russia, although it still remains an option.\n\nFor the west Russia has not been a military threat, but they do outright excel in their propaganda/disinformation and their foreign influence game. The fact that it's not even surprising anymore that large amounts of groups outright choose Russia's imperialistic side and talking points is a testament to the outright success of their campaign and influence, although I am horrified by it. But on the other hand the west response to these tactics have also been very weak to outright non-existent, especially when propaganda moves more to mainstream it becomes partisan which result into becoming a \"free speech\" issue.

The threat of death came from a distance, and seemingly from everywhere.\n\nSent to guard against a potential river crossing in southern Ukraine, his hastily formed unit, made up almost entirely of inmates, endured weeks of relentless bombardment, sniper attacks and ambushes. The marshy, flat terrain offered no cover beyond the burned-out hulks of cottages. He said he had watched dogs gnaw at the uncollected corpses of his dead comrades, drunk rain water and scavenged garbage dumps for food.\n\nAleksandr claims that out of the 120 men in his unit, only about 40 remain alive. These survivors are being heavily pressured by the Russian military to remain on the battlefield at the end of their six-month contracts, according to Aleksandr and accounts provided to The New York Times from two other Russian inmates fighting on the front line.\n\n\u201cWe are being sent to a slaughter,\u201d Aleksandr said in a series of audio messages from the Kherson region, referring to his commanders. \u201cWe are not human to them, because we are criminals.\u201d\n\nHis account provides a rare window into the fighting in Ukraine from a Russian inmate\u2019s perspective. Units made up of convicts have become one of the cornerstones of Russian military strategy as the prolonged fighting has decimated the country\u2019s regular forces. Aleksandr\u2019s descriptions could not be independently confirmed, but they aligned with accounts from Ukrainian soldiers and Russian prisoners of war who said that Moscow used inmates essentially as cannon fodder.\n\nAleksandr\u2019s testimony conveys the brutality imposed on Russian convicts, and the human cost Moscow is prepared to pay to maintain control of the occupied territory.\n\nThey have described irregular wage payments that fell far short of the amounts promised to them by the state and an inability to collect compensation for injuries. Aleksandr also said that his officers had explicitly prevented men in his unit from collecting dead comrades from the battlefield.\n\nHe claimed that this was done to prevent their families from claiming compensation, because the dead soldiers would be registered as missing rather than as killed in action.\n\n\u201cThere were bodies everywhere,\u201d Aleksandr said, describing the fighting on the banks of the Dnipro River in May. \u201cNo one was interested in collecting them.\u201d\n\nAleksandr also claimed that his officers used threats and intimidation to force surviving inmates to remain at the front for another year after the end of their contracts. Another inmate soldier currently serving on the Zaporizhzhia front further east said that his contract had obliged him to remain in Ukraine for an additional year after obtaining his pardon, this time as a professional soldier.\n\nAll inmates spoke of colossal casualties in their units and of their commanders\u2019 seeming disregard for their lives.\n\nAfter a month of training near the occupied city of Luhansk, Aleksandr said he was sent with his unit to hold a line of former holiday homes near the Antonovskiy Bridge, an area that Ukraine has been targeting with hit-and-run attacks since Russia\u2019s forces withdrew to the east bank of the Dnipro in November.\n\nThey spent the next three and a half weeks under constant bombardment from the invisible enemy, who shelled their exposed positions from across the river and targeted them with snipers and night ambushes. Enemy drones constantly hovered in the air.\n\nThe aim of their mission was unclear to them; they were told to simply remain in their positions. They had no heavy weapons and no means to defend themselves against Ukrainian attacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running around with an automatic gun like an idiot. I haven\u2019t made a single shot, I haven\u2019t seen a single enemy,\u201d a former inmate from Aleksandr\u2019s unit named Dmitri, who is now deceased, said in a voice message at the time. \u201cWe are just a bait to expose their artillery positions.\u201d The message was shared with The Times by Dmitri\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cWhy the hell do I need to be here? To sit around and shake like a rabbit because shells keep on exploding all around you?\u201d Dmitri said in one of the messages.\n\nAleksandr said his unit had been left without food and water for days after asking their commanders to be relieved, forcing them to scavenge for ration biscuits and drink rain water treated with chlorine.\n\nIn late May, Aleksandr was sent on a mission to mine a riverbank. His unit was hit by a Ukrainian howitzer shell, which detonated nearby mines.\n\nAll of the other men in his detachment died instantly, he said; Aleksandr was injured.\n\n\u201cIt was raining, and I fell into a puddle,\u201d he said, describing the attack. \u201cI crawled away bit by bit and then covered myself with some rubble, because I knew they would finish me off.\u201d He said he had managed to send text messages to his unit before losing consciousness.\n\nThe next day, he was dragged out by his comrades and evacuated to a hospital in Crimea. Though he still couldn\u2019t walk well, he was sent back to the front line, before being put in a hut in the rear with other convalescing fighters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so scary to remain here,\u201d Aleksandr said. \u201cThis is not our war.

But after retiring in 2018, McGonigal said he went to work for the billionaire, digging up background on a Deripaska rival, Norilsk Nickel President Vladimir Potanin.\n\n>\u201cI never intended to hurt the United States, the FBI or my friends and loved ones,\u201d McGonigal told US District Judge Jennifer H. Rearden in New York on Tuesday, his voice breaking from emotion. His sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 14 and he faces as long as five years in prison.\n\n> McGonigal\u2019s plea resolves criminal charges in New York, where he was arrested in January at John F. Kennedy International Airport on his return from an unrelated trip to Asia. He still faces separate charges in a Washington indictment that accuses him of falsification of records and making false statements.\n\n>\u201cHe\u2019s accepted responsibility and is trying to move on with his life,\u201d McGonigal\u2019s lawyer, Seth DuCharme, said outside court. DuCharme said his client is \u201copen\u201d to pleading guilty in the Washington case if he can get a fair plea agreement.\n\n>As special agent in charge, McGonigal oversaw counterintelligence and national security matters, including an investigation into Deripaska, who had ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Deripaska is the majority shareholder of Russian power and metals giant En+ Group International and has a net worth of around $3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\n> McGonigal served in the FBI from 1996 to 2018. He participated in secret investigations of Deripaska and other wealthy and influential Russians, according to the US. Prosecutors said he agreed in 2021 to investigate a Russian rival of Deripaska, in exchange for concealed payments.\n\n> In the court hearing, McGonigal told the judge he was paid $17,500 for doing \u201copen-source\u201d research on Potanin, currently the richest person in Russia, according to the Billionaires Index. McGonigal said Deripaska paid the money from an account at the Russian Gazprombank JSC, through a bank in Cyprus, to an account in New Jersey and on to McGonigal. The arrangement was intended to obscure Deripaska as the source of the illegal payments, he said. McGonigal has agreed to forfeit the $17,500.\n\n> Assistant US Attorney Rebecca Dell told the judge that, if the case were to go forward, prosecutors would prove that McGonigal and an unidentified co-conspirator planned to share files that were found on the dark web relating to Potanin for a fee of $625,000 to $3 million.\n\n>Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference explored connections between Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s one-time campaign chairman, and Deripaska. The Russian businessman is himself separately charged with violating US sanctions, in an alleged scheme to ensure two children he fathered would be born in the US and hold US citizenship. Deripaska hasn\u2019t appeared to enter a plea in the case.\n\n>Also charged with McGonigal in the New York case is Sergey Shestakov, a US citizen and a former Russian diplomat, who worked in New York as a court translator.

But after retiring in 2018, McGonigal said he went to work for the billionaire, digging up background on a Deripaska rival, Norilsk Nickel President Vladimir Potanin.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI never intended to hurt the United States, the FBI or my friends and loved ones,\u201d McGonigal told US District Judge Jennifer H. Rearden in New York on Tuesday, his voice breaking from emotion. His sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 14 and he faces as long as five years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>McGonigal\u2019s plea resolves criminal charges in New York, where he was arrested in January at John F. Kennedy International Airport on his return from an unrelated trip to Asia. He still faces separate charges in a Washington indictment that accuses him of falsification of records and making false statements.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s accepted responsibility and is trying to move on with his life,\u201d McGonigal\u2019s lawyer, Seth DuCharme, said outside court. DuCharme said his client is \u201copen\u201d to pleading guilty in the Washington case if he can get a fair plea agreement.</p>\n\n<p>As special agent in charge, McGonigal oversaw counterintelligence and national security matters, including an investigation into Deripaska, who had ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Deripaska is the majority shareholder of Russian power and metals giant En+ Group International and has a net worth of around $3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p>\n\n<p>McGonigal served in the FBI from 1996 to 2018. He participated in secret investigations of Deripaska and other wealthy and influential Russians, according to the US. Prosecutors said he agreed in 2021 to investigate a Russian rival of Deripaska, in exchange for concealed payments.</p>\n\n<p>In the court hearing, McGonigal told the judge he was paid $17,500 for doing \u201copen-source\u201d research on Potanin, currently the richest person in Russia, according to the Billionaires Index. McGonigal said Deripaska paid the money from an account at the Russian Gazprombank JSC, through a bank in Cyprus, to an account in New Jersey and on to McGonigal. The arrangement was intended to obscure Deripaska as the source of the illegal payments, he said. McGonigal has agreed to forfeit the $17,500.</p>\n\n<p>Assistant US Attorney Rebecca Dell told the judge that, if the case were to go forward, prosecutors would prove that McGonigal and an unidentified co-conspirator planned to share files that were found on the dark web relating to Potanin for a fee of $625,000 to $3 million.</p>\n\n<p>Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference explored connections between Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s one-time campaign chairman, and Deripaska. The Russian businessman is himself separately charged with violating US sanctions, in an alleged scheme to ensure two children he fathered would be born in the US and hold US citizenship. Deripaska hasn\u2019t appeared to enter a plea in the case.</p>\n\n<p>Also charged with McGonigal in the New York case is Sergey Shestakov, a US citizen and a former Russian diplomat, who worked in New York as a court translator. The government claims he lied to FBI agents in a November 2021 meeting in a Manhattan restaurant. Shestakov has pleaded not guilty.</p>\n\n<p>McGonigal retired in 2018, then worked the next year, along with Shestakov, in an unsuccessful attempt to get the sanctions against Deripaska lifted, according to the government. In emails, he and Shestakov referred to Deripaska as \u201cthe individual,\u201d \u201cour friend from Vienna\u201d and \u201cthe Vienna client,\u201d prosecutors claimed.</p>\n\n<p>In the Washington case, McGonigal is charged with taking $225,000 in cash from a New Jersey businessman while still working as head of counterintelligence in New York.

That would be ~3x the open source Wikipedia values which seem extraordinary, but I don't see the incentive for a lie there. \"Yeah, Ukraine is getting fucked up indeed!\" Information could easily be drowned out in those early days, but who knows.\n\nThe Wiki also has [a list](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%BA_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%85_%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D1%96%D0%B4_%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81_%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%96%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F) that totals all the monthly data together in a very useful chart (again, great link). Ukraine was reporting only ~25% interception rates for six months months until October where they had since reported almost all 60%+. Odd, they decided to lie once they received [NASMS](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-receives-us-air-defence-system-2022-09-25/) and [IRIS-T](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-has-received-iris-t-air-defence-system-germany-spiegel-2022-10-11/)  systems for some reason. And how do they lie?

He's one of those characters situated so close to the border between what's credible and what isn't that I have no clue when he's serious and when he's posturing.\n\nFirst off, it's probably obvious but I think I should state it nonetheless for context: I think it's highly unlikely that these statements are not part of a \"role\". It's not just that they're consistent and he stays in character, it's also that other explanations are IMHO unlikely.\n\nOn the one hand, this man is a serious politician. He's a former president, and while the modern Russian Federation is young and plutocratic enough that there are literally no other former presidents around to establish a tradition of former presidents weighing in on matters of significant public interest, he inevitably retains some of the authority of that position, dulled though it may be due to the circumstances under which it was held.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the things he said lately are the kind of things we say in the *other* defense-related subreddit. It's unlikely that someone with his history in politics doesn't realise that. Barring truly tragic things that would've become evident by now, like mental illness, which I think would've seen him marginalised by now, I think it's fair to say that these statements are deliberate and calculated.\n\nThe real question is who he's playing it for and unfortunately I just don't think we have enough information here. We're back to the Cold War-era problem of the Kremlin being simply too opaque to figure these things out.\n\nMedvedev's rhetoric has shifted dramatically after he resigned back in 2020. Now, on the one hand, that seemed like a very weak move that further cemented his public image of Putin's lackey, and that's caused some observers to speculate that the shift in rhetoric was his attempt to remain relevant (see e.g. [here](https://www.rferl.org/a/medvedev-liberal-to-bellicose/31818941.html)). But on the other hand he was co-opted into Putin's more opaque institution, away from a position that became even weaker in the new constitutional system, and his shift in rhetoric goes in the same direction as Putin's.\n\nHis statements, though often non-credible, also echo real elements of Russian policy. This one is actually no exception: the language used by the Russian administration in the early days of the \"special military operation\" is eerily close to the language used to describe the partition of Germany, and the Russian administration has explicitly referred to the possibility of partition more than once (see e.g. [here](https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/88585)).\n\nThe position of the hardline ideologue isn't novel, it's a public role that was extensively used in the Soviet Union, but Medvedev doesn't fit the bill. He's not an eminence gris who provides guidance to more people-minded leaders when they need it but is otherwise content to support, rather than to enact leadership. He's got fifteen years of being seen as Putin's yes man behind, loves (and clearly regrets losing) the public light, and has been largely unable to formulate anything in novel ideological terms, he's more like that angry old punk in the public square who shouts the same things his favourite politicians say, only angrier, more categorical, and in more extreme terms.\n\nIt's not implausible that he's simply a loose cannon. All autocratic regimes have at least one of these, and as long as they're sufficiently powerless (which Medvedev's current position guarantees, at least in political terms) it's usually better to keep them around. As long as he runs his mouth on TV, he's mostly harmless, it's frustrated politicians with no token government position and no TV to run their mouths on that are dangerous, as they often end up talking to people who promise them government positions.\n\nBut on the other hand, I also think it's not implausible that this is a real political move from the Russian political establishment. A yes man who's a vocal supporter of the war is exactly the kind of pawn they need if Putin's presidency and the war turn sour. He is someone who could be made palatable to the only members of Russian society that are are vocal and violent enough to enact political change, with only a little bit of TV drama, and would allow the current establishment to hold on to power even without having Putin in a very public-facing position.\n\nThere's definitely the possibility that he's playing both sides (i.e. playing his role as directed in the hope that this'll also carve out some independent political career for himself) but I'm not convinced. Some mutual benefit is a necessary condition of any political move, sure. But there's no way Medvedev doesn't realize any hope of him holding real power hinges on Putin being out of the picture for good -- he hasn't done anything without Putin's instructions and approval for a long time, and no one, neither the general public nor other politicians, will ever take him seriously if he heads an administration that Putin is also a part of. IMHO playing the other side in this scenario is orders of magnitude more risky than someone with Medvedev's profile would be willing to engage in.",

However, it's kind of a hollow function. \n\nThe SBRF is roughly equivalent to the US' National Security Council, in that it's a consultative forum that advises the president. Like the NSC, the SBRF gathers heads of various state institutions, so almost everyone on the council has some actual government function outside that council.\n\nUnlike the NSC, the SBRF does have some specific permanent functions though.

A launch platform can increase the dV only by flying faster, so a launch standing still (like a ground launch) its a ton different than a launch at Mach 1.2, only possible on an air launch. Second air density, which changes according to altitude, is an important (perhaps *the* most important) factor and can severely impact range. An AIM-120 fired at optimal parameters, above 30k ft and Mach 1, could have a range out to that 75km and be a very dangerous missile. But a missile fired low and slow, at a target that is also on the deck, is going to be *severely* limited when compared to its 'optimal' performance numbers. And then third you have radar guidance, the horizon (particularly as impacted by geographic features) is a serious limiting factor for range in ground launches. The AIM-120 seeker head has, IIRC, only about a 10km range in itself. Beyond that it really needs to be guided in by a datalink with a more powerful transmitter. Which may struggle to identify a low flying target at long ranges, particularly if its ground based. \n\nWe already know that thanks to the R-37M Ukrainian aircraft are forced to fly low and fast. The NASAMS are themselves limited by physics, even in the ER configuration which, IIRC, only has a 25km range.

Desantis appears to be campaigning on a message that he will upset Democrats more than the alternatives, for example. Trump is campaigning largely on grievances.\n\nSo suppose you're a Democrat who doesn't like Biden. It probably doesn't matter much because you fear Trump, Desantis etc enough that you won't do anything to weaken Biden because that might empower the Republicans, and that's an unacceptable risk.

Russians have been pushed to the south of the village, but I don't think UAF has a permanent presence in the settlement itself. I would note that there is (per every Ukrainian source) a huge swath of grey area where UAF recon groups were able to operate, but as of now I'd be very cautious to call those advances until they are able to properly consolidate, it's very likely we'll see quite significant counter attacks into areas that UAF hasn't been able to fully secure, so the lines will likely shift quite a bit in the coming days. This is a caveat I think he left out of the update and I struggle to think of a Pro-UA source that didn't underline that.\n\nEssentially from my understanding there are currently 4 different areas through which UAF is trying to advance, but keep in mind there is a lot of fluidity and a lack of clarity, with that being said:\n\n1. Inside Robotyne proper - itself positioned on high ground, somewhere around 400 to 500 feet, just slightly lower elevation than some points on the rest of the way to Tokmak\n2. Towards Verbove - both south and north of the Robotyne-Verbova road, but mostly roughly in the area where we had that BMP-1 test the minefields a few weeks back and it's mostly through low ground\n3. Southwards, bypassing Robotyne from the east, and pushing towards Novoprokopivka - there is some RUMINT of some limited engagements taking place on the outskirts of Novoprokopvika. Reading some Russian sources I had a feeling there is some truth to it, but again - wait and see.\n4. Westwards from the \"salient\" towards Kopani - this one is the one I've read most conflicting stories about and not quite sure what to make of it. Even some Russian sources claim AFU is really close to Kopani, but Ukrainian ones are for now kinda downplaying it. My guess is that it's again a matter of a rather large grey zone with a few UAF recon probes making it rather deep. Alternatively, I've read that the advance towards Kopani was made southwards from the pre-offensive lines, but I have serious doubts Ukrainians would risk getting into a minefield, I think it's most likely a splinter from the advance towards Robotyne.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI made a post some days ago where I was rather upbeat about this sector - there is certainly a lot more operational space than we have previously seen as well as less effective CW measures, but most of these advances have been in the lowlands, with prominent heights being as following: Kopani itself, a ridgeline from Kopani to a midpoint between Robotyne to Novoprokopivka, both of these settlements being on the high ground and another ridgeline from Novoprokopivka to just south of Verbove, with the settlement itself being in the low grounds. In other words, they've mostly advanced/probed through the lower areas and they must consolidate and secure some of those heights, probably in the next few days.\n\nLooking at the map of pre-prepared lines and using previous Russian MO in the area, I don't think these new developments are completely due to pre-prepared Russian positions being clustered around the heights, but some of them most certainly are - I would at least ascribe it the apparent lack of minefields until we get more evidence about the minefield situation deeper behind the lines, or from more \"width;\" if that makes sense. The first few kilometres of dense minefields in this direction might've rather been an exception than the norm, but again - speculating on that part.",

RHM has the capacity to do 600k 155mm shells/year, CSG has capacity for ~150k, they said they should be able to ramp up to ~200k soon, Saab can do ~250k, Thales, BAE and others (such as Nammo and Nexter) have  another ~300k at the very least (likely much more). So, they can in *theory* do around 1.3-1.5mm/annually. However, that\u2019s just production *capacity*. Throughput depends on contracts, etc., where progress is a lot slower. In the U.S. they should be able to ramp up to ~1mm/annum in actual throughput in a year. Take out replacement rates, and that\u2019s quite a bit more capacity than Ukraine can even handle with its current 155mm guns. But that was just 155mm shells. Then you have all the other NATO tube artillery calibers, and NATO caliber rocket ammo. Then, Bulgaria and Pakistan are also helping, with the former contributing Soviet caliber ammo, especially 152mm and 122mm ammo. Combine all the different calibers, and production sources, Ukraine should have enough artillery ammunition. However, that\u2019s only if contracts are signed, and if bottlenecks can be removed. On that front, TNT is apparently the biggest sticking point, but the U.S. recently struck a deal with Japan to ease through that. Add in DPICM and potentially M26 cluster munitions, that\u2019s sufficient. They\u2019ll still be outshot by the Russians this year, by a substantial amount as the year progresses, but things will improve next year.",

Which isn't surprising since the likelihood of doing well was null when they didn't even exist six months ago, their training was as abbreviated as it gets, and they get thrown into the attack on the most highly defended areas of the Russian lines in Ukraine. That said, while they're losing troops and equipment, and it's not the right way to learn (because of the cost of mistakes), those units will likely learn. \n\nDespite having MANY lines in depth on the Orhiniv-Tokmat-Melitipol axis and a more developed main line behind the existing Velyka Novosilka-Berdyansk axis FEBA, the Russians aren't doing a maneuver defense, aren't retreating unless pushed out with heavy losses. So that means the Russians are replicating the UAF Hold At All Cost defensive policy, almost surely a political decision part of a larger exhaustion strategy designed to deny PR victories to the Ukrainians hoping to break their will, more importantly the will of NATO backers. You can see yourself that it's partially working, lots of public negativity about this offensive lately in Western press. But partially don't win wars. It's a very risky strategy, it's not at all worked so far despite both sides doing it since last spring.\n\nAnd that policy, prioritizing every square centimeter of territory over everything else, is doing incredible damage to the Russian force structure (like it also did to the Ukrainians) because they're remaining in every weakening positions, with weak points identified, gaps in obstacles made, flanks opened, supply lines interdicted, etc, long after they should retreat to better made fresh defenses. But if they do that, Ukraine can claim success publicly. \n\nUkraine seems to have switched to a fires centric incremental approach rather than audacious, fast attempts at armored breakthroughs, because those aren't working. The need to support their longer timeline with a fires centric approach led to Biden finally unlocking hundreds of thousands DPICM shells from the US since mid July,, and it's helped. \n\nThe Ukrainians seemed to be using smaller scale attacks, more dismounted efforts, and while I still think that's crazy because of the risk, it might be a \"stupid but works\" decision because they don't have a solution for the KA-52, Lancet, ATGM, artillery threat against their AFV attacks, whereas dismounts in small units might be able to get through the ISR screen and make gains while taking acceptable losses. That's a hunch, OPSEC has been pretty intense and the musing of Kofman and Co after their latest Ukraine leads me with as many questions as before because...those guys aren't the greatest when explaining the tactical side of modern warfare.\n\nI'm definitely not calling the offensive any time soon. The UAF got a few hundred thousand ROK arty shells from April-May and then maybe an equal of DPICM, so they'll be able to keep this offensive going at a high fires pace for at least another month or two.\n\nHowever, I don't think their long term artillery ammo prospects are good unless some other massive global stockpile belonging to an otherwise neutral side opens up a million or more rounds to the UA after this ends. Since that isn't assured, Ukraine can't risk shooting up their entire stockpile, so they might call it quits early and evaluate. Or switch strategies to something that isn't fires centric.\n\nThe Ukrainians are also hitting Moscow pretty regularly with drone strikes. Considering all things aren't equal and Russia possesses nuclear weapons that are meant to make something like that too risky to contemplate, I think Ukraine is either suicidally ballsy or they're getting desperate for their exhaustion strategy to kick in and the Russian willpower/resolve be broken. \n\nConsidering Western resolve is wary at best, and the long term artillery ammo issue that isn't getting fixed anytime soon, and that Russia is exhausted too, I think negotiations will start soon.

Strategy is an oft abused term, we have entire genre's of games about strategy (Real Time Strategy) which have no strategic level elements in them as defined in the context of military science and affairs. In a discussion like this though I think its really vital to use terms accurately, because it really helps clear up exactly what youre asking about.\n\nStrategy is defined by the US Army, in a rough definition, as \"the proper correlation of means and ends with national objective.\" This is derived from Clausewitz, who argued that \"war is an act of force designed to compel the enemy to do your will.\" To put all this in laymans terms, take the weapons and systems you have on hand (an act of force), and use them to transform the world in some meaningful way (to compel). Strategy tells  you how to apply that force in a way which forces the enemy to do a thing you want them to do. This thing is defined, as Clausewitz says, by political leaders, and represents what your side wants in a war. So for example, Ukraine wants Russia to fuck off (thats a political goal). They apply the weapons they have, to liberate the occupied regions, to translate that into fucking off. Thats a rough and ready definition of strategy, but I'd argue its also pretty ugly (and pretty operational) because it discounts the role of diplomacy and economics, particularly in generating new forces for field units, and other big picture items. \n\nIf we look using this Clausewitzian definition of strategy I'd argue Ukraine has pretty clearly held the strategic initiative since last summer/fall. We can argue about when exactly the Russian offensives (or were there two offensives? Definitions again...) culminated. But at some point after the fall of Severodonetsk Russia ran out of road for its own strategic concept and abandoned the initiative to Ukraine, who began to tap into its diplomatic network to build the strength for a series of operational counterattacks which would accomplish its goals. And generally Ukraine has done that and the course of the war has pretty solidly stayed in their hands. We could again argue over Bakhmut, I would argue it was a Russian *attempt* to regain the strategic initiative. But their failure to break through and translate a single tactical victory (taking the city) into a larger operational movement, say to the Dnepr, basically prevented any real chance of initiative shifting sides. We could talk about why Russia struggles to regain the strategic initiative, but I'd argue that at this point Russia in its current configuration *could not* regain the initiative as its war aims are pretty solidly defensive (frozen conflict).\n\nWe also need to separate operations from strategy. The operational art has a million definitions, none particularly illuminating. I define it simply as tying together several tactical engagements (battles) to take a meaningful step towards the attainment of a strategic goal. Ukraine took operational initiative last fall during the Kherson and Kharkov attacks (two separate operational actions). It lost initiative in the north sometime in the winter and Russia has regained it. Russia also recaptured some initiative in the central area during the Bakhmut battles. But Ukraine has recently recaptured operational initiative during its own counterattacks, though Russia is continuously trying to regain *tactical* initiative at the lower level to destabilize that offensive. \n\nIf Ukraine is able to use this offensive to achieve another important strategic goal, and that may be as simple as 'ensuring continued western support' then I think its a success for them. If Russia is able to come up with a proactive way it can win the war, or put together an offensive that can break through, they might be able to regain some strategic initiative. I will say that Ukraine is closer to losing its initiative than it was this time last year, but I still personally do not see initiative at the strategic level shifting much in the short term. We will have to see where their offensive culminates and how that impacts the political theater. If it pushes Ukraine to negotiate, Russia could recapture at the table what it lost on the battlefield.",

Then they are given y, less than x but still very substantial.
