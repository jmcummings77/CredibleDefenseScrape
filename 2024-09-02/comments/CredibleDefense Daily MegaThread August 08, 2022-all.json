Maybe CCP members are more blood-thirsty, but to me the risk versus reward of China starting a war over Taiwan doesn't seem worthwhile. China's had to work hard to drag itself up to their current level of prosperity. I dunno that the CCP rhetoric actually matches their aims. The last Chinese war was in 1979 against Vietnam, and that was a totally different leadership ideology-wise (since China was defending Pol Pot before they decided that was wrong-headed).",

Again, the Winter War shows us that you can lose a good chunk of valuable land, and still come out well ahead.

The region is flat as a board and mostly farm land, with few cities, few substantial rivers or bodies of water, and few forested areas to use as defensive obstacles.

When disassembled, 27 of these weapons and military systems, ranging from cruise missiles to air defence systems, were found to rely predominantly on Western components, according to the research shared with Reuters.\n\nIt is the most detailed published assessment to date of the part played by Western components in Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the components were manufactured by U.S.-based companies, RUSI found, based on the weapons recovered from Ukraine. Products manufactured by the U.S.-based Analog Devices and Texas Instruments accounted for nearly a quarter of all the Western components in the weapons.\n\nOther components came from companies in countries including Japan, South Korea, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.\n\n\"Russian weapons that are critically dependent upon Western electronics have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians,\" Jack Watling, a land warfare specialist at RUSI, told Reuters.\n\nWhile many of the foreign components are found in everyday household goods such as microwaves that are not subject to export controls, RUSI said a strengthening of export restrictions and enforcement could make it harder for Russia to replenish its arsenal of weapons such as cruise missiles.\n\nIn one case, a Russian 9M727 cruise missile, one of the country's most advanced weapons that can manoeuvre at low altitude to evade radar and can strike targets hundreds of miles away, contained 31 foreign components. The parts were made by companies that included U.S-based Texas Instruments Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc(AMD.O) , as well as Cypress Semiconductor, which is now owned by Infineon AG(IFXGn.DE) , a German company, the RUSI investigation found.\n\nIn another case, a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, which has been used to strike Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, also had 31 foreign components with parts manufactured by companies including U.S.-based Intel Corporation and AMD-owned Xilinx.\n\nIn response to questions about how their chips ended up in Russian weapons, the companies said they comply with trade sanctions and they have stopped selling components to Russia.\n\nAnalog Devices said the company closed their business in Russia and instructed distributors to halt shipments to the country.\n\nTexas Instruments said it follows all laws in the countries where they operate and the parts found in the Russian weapons were designed for commercial products. Intel said it \"does not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights.\"\n\nInfineon said it was \"deeply concerned\" if its products are being used for purposes which they were not designed for. AMD said it strictly follows all global export control laws.\n\nMany of the foreign components only cost a few dollars and Russian companies would have been able to buy them before the start of the Ukraine invasion online through domestic or international distributors because they could be used in non-military applications.\n\nHowever, more than 80 Western-manufactured microchips were subject to U.S. export controls since at least 2014 meaning they would have required a licence to be shipped to Russia, RUSI said. The companies exporting the parts had a responsibility to carry out due diligence to ensure they were not being sent to the Russian military or for a military end-use, according to RUSI.\n\nThe investigation's findings show how Russia's military remains reliant on foreign microchips for everything from tactical radios to drones and precision long-range munitions, and that Western governments were slow to limit Russia's access to these technologies particularly after President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Crimea in 2014.\n\nRussia's war with Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and laid waste to several cities. Russia's superior firepower, including its use of cruise and ballistic missiles, has helped its forces grind through eastern Ukraine and occupy around a fifth of the country.\n\nRussian troops have fired more than 3,650 missiles and guided rockets in the first five months of the war, according to the Staff of the National Security and Defense Council. These include the 9M727 and Kh-101 missiles. Russian missiles have been used to hit targets including railway lines to disrupt Western supply lines, military infrastructure and civilian targets such as shopping centres and hospitals. Russia said it has only fired at military targets. Russian authorities didn't provide further comment for this story.\n\nIn the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, the United States announced sweeping sanctions to try to weaken Russia's economy and its military. This included a ban on many sensitive microchips being sold to Russia. Countries in Europe, as well as Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea - all key chipmaking countries \u2013 have announced similar restrictions. Russia characterises the conflict as a special military operation meant to disarm Ukraine. Moscow has cast the sanctions as a hostile act and has denied targeting civilians.\n\nRussia is currently working to find new routes to secure access to Western microchips, according to RUSI. Many components are sold through distributors operating in Asia, such as Hong Kong, which acts as a gateway for electronics making their way to the Russian military or companies acting on its behalf, RUSI found.\n\nRussia's government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe U.S. government said in March that Russian firms were front companies that have been buying up electronics for Russia's military. Russian customs records show that in March last year one company imported $600,000 worth of electronics manufactured by Texas Instruments through a Hong Kong distributor, RUSI said. Seven months later, the same company imported another $1.1 million worth of microelectronics made by Xilinx, RUSI said.\n\nTexas Instruments and AMD-owned Xilinx did not respond to a request for comment about the customs data.\n\nRussia's military could be permanently weakened if Western governments strengthen export controls, manage to shut down the country's clandestine procurement networks and prevent sensitive components being manufactured in states that support Russia, RUSI said.\n\n((reporting by Andrew MacAskill; edited by Janet McBride))",

They wanted to decapitate the Ukrainian government without committing the soldiers needed to do so. They want to portray themselves as the voice of the voiceless and real guardians of Ukrainian civilians while their state media calls them dirt people and their military leaves their bodies to rot in the streets. We speculate and joke about how many more square kilometers they'll take measured in the hundreds before digging in and stopping their advance, but they still refuse to target key Ukrainian infrastructure as if they believe they'll still take the entire country and don't want to commit the resources to repairing it in the future.\n\nThis is essentially my thoughts on this matter.

They wanted to decapitate the Ukrainian government without committing the soldiers needed to do so. They want to portray themselves as the voice of the voiceless and real guardians of Ukrainian civilians while their state media calls them dirt people and their military leaves their bodies to rot in the streets. We speculate and joke about how many more square kilometers they&#39;ll take measured in the hundreds before digging in and stopping their advance, but they still refuse to target key Ukrainian infrastructure as if they believe they&#39;ll still take the entire country and don&#39;t want to commit the resources to repairing it in the future.</p>\n\n<p>This is essentially my thoughts on this matter.

When the plant first fell into Russian hands I looked for what info I could find on how operations work there. There's not much and I'm not a Russian speaker, but it looks like the initial storage is inside the containment, then they're transfered via railcar to a building that repackages it into dry cask.

So at least we don't have to worry about the dry storage.\n\nSome nuclear containment is actually designed to withstand shelling or bombs. But even if it explicitly isn't, if it's sized properly to mitigate a steam explosion in the reactor itself, it's gonna be some seriously tough stuff.\n\nVVERs aren't walk away safe for sure. I couldn't find much info about the backups at this plant but the wiki page does mention a couple prompt shutdown incidents in recent years so clearly they're in working order.\n\nThere are some walk away safe fourth gen designs. There's a couple different schemes I'm aware of. One of the motivations for pebble bed reactors is they could be practical at scale using only air cooling. Another simple idea is to just have a massive enough water pool. NuScale and most of the small modular reactor startups take this route. CANDU reactors (a really neat design) use this same idea to enable partial passive safety. The outer pool is large enough if a CANDU goes into meltdown, emergency workers will have a useful amount of time to restore cooling. Lots of reactor designs do things like set up the steam loops so they can run at least partially via convection to blunt the spike in a meltdown. Military naval reactors used by the US apparently can operate at substantial power levels with their pumps off.\n\nAnd fascinatingly, you can design a truly passive safe reactor, by engineering a solid fuel slug with a negative void coefficient. That ensures that as temperatures rise, the expansion of the material reduces the reaction rate. One of the designs NASA is pursuing for Mars and such works this way. It's totally passive.

Otherwise, it's just a bluff. Which is what I think is actually happening right now, at least at the political leadership level. The Russian leaders want to give the impression they might blow the plant in order to deter the Ukrainian counteroffensive, but they won't come straight out and make the threat openly because they know how badly they would damage their already thin international support. But they're happy to leave the west and Ukraine in doubt to complicate any offensives as well as the politics around western supplies. So they intentionally leak information about mining buildings and placing equipment in dangerous locations around the plant so that Ukraine and the west are left with the impression that retaking the land bridge has a large probability of triggering a nuclear disaster. \n\nWhat concerns me is that what starts as a bluff may turn into a serious option if the Russians get desperate enough. A Chernobyl-scale event would almost certainly put a complete stop to any hostilities in the region as Ukraine isn't equipped to fight in the middle of a fallout zone and would be forced to redirect precious (likely military) resources to containing the problem. If the Russians can frame any ZNPP disaster as the result of a Ukrainian attack, that may be sufficient for them to maintain domestic stability and avoid alienating their limited remaining international partners. It fits their MO. They don't need a good excuse to justify their actions, just enough doubt to let their disinformation tactics undermine any organized domestic or international backlash.\n\nIf they decide that's the only way to stop the Ukrainians from retaking the land bridge and thus to avoid the humiliation of total defeat, they may conclude it's better to just scorch the earth and create an irradiated buffer zone that lets them retain control over Crimea and the Donbas. As long as the Ukrainians take the blame domestically in Russia, the Russian leadership won't give a shit one way or the other.\n\nWhat really scares me is what might happen during a sudden and rapid Russian rout, during which the Ukrainians start retaking large swathes of territory very quickly while inflicting significant casualties on the fleeing Russian forces. Then, the Russians may perceive blowing the plant (or explicitly threatening to do so) as an acceptable method for temporarily halting the offensive so they can stabilize their lines.",

        "body": "I thought I would compare the Russian invasion of Ukraine and see if I can extrapolate some interesting loss projections based on the Karabakh war. Of course all comparisons are faulty, but the Karabakh war was recent (just 2 years ago), also involved nations fighting with mostly Soviet equipment, with some modern equipment thrown in and it was, like the current conflict, a near-peer one.\n\nSo the idea is to compare Armenian and Azerbaijani manpower loss data from Wikipedia and equipment loss data from Oryx to the equipment loss data of Russia and Ukraine from Oryx. I did not do any source checking and obviously a lot of caveats apply (actual losses to reported losses, documented losses to actual losses, the reasons for the losses etc etc).\n\nFirst of all some notes about the Karabakh war:\n\nLasted for 45 days\n\nArmenia suffered 3 825 killed and a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 2,94, at a daily loss of 85 KIA.\n\nAzerbaijan suffered 3 447 KIA (along with Syrian mercenaries) and a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 3,23, at a daily loss of 77 KIA.\n\nArmenia lost (documented in Oryx) 415 units of \u201ccommon\u201d armour (Tanks, AFVs, IFVs, no SP-stuff) and 1 841 units of total equipment losses.\n\nAzerbaijan lost 156 of common armour and only 275 units of total equipment.\n\nThen I tabulated the Russian and Ukrainian losses from Oryx and applied the same KIA ratios from the Karabakh war.\n\n|KIA if ratio of KIA to x comparable to y:|Russia|Ukraine|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Armour to Armenia|24 056|5 871|\n|Equipment to Armenia|10 604|3 023|\n|Armour to Azerbaijan|57 671|14 075|\n||||\n|Equipment to Azerbaijan|63 976|18 238|\n|Killed per day Armenia|14 195|14 195|\n|Killed per day Azerbaijan|12 792|12 792|\n\nFor total casualties it seems entirely reasonable to multiply these numbers by 4, as the 3-1 WIA-to-KIA ratio seems to hold.\n\nThe point of this exercise to get an idea of the plausible scale of losses for the war. The particular comparisons are very subject to differences in reporting and documentation.\n\nFor example if Armenia documented 80% of their equipment losses and Ukraine 40%, then the Ukranian KIA losses would be 2x higher than showed in this table.\n\nIf an army is armour heavy (as the main bulk of the Russian professional army is), it will likely look worse in the armour-loss category than a lightly armed infantry army (like Ukrainian TDF, or DNR/LNR mobilized mass). A completely unarmoured force, that loses no armoured vehicles would have a KIA assessment of 0 in that cell.",

I did not do any source checking and obviously a lot of caveats apply (actual losses to reported losses, documented losses to actual losses, the reasons for the losses etc etc).</p>\n\n<p>First of all some notes about the Karabakh war:</p>\n\n<p>Lasted for 45 days</p>\n\n<p>Armenia suffered 3 825 killed and a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 2,94, at a daily loss of 85 KIA.</p>\n\n<p>Azerbaijan suffered 3 447 KIA (along with Syrian mercenaries) and a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 3,23, at a daily loss of 77 KIA.</p>\n\n<p>Armenia lost (documented in Oryx) 415 units of \u201ccommon\u201d armour (Tanks, AFVs, IFVs, no SP-stuff) and 1 841 units of total equipment losses.</p>\n\n<p>Azerbaijan lost 156 of common armour and only 275 units of total equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Then I tabulated the Russian and Ukrainian losses from Oryx and applied the same KIA ratios from the Karabakh war.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">KIA if ratio of KIA to x comparable to y:</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Russia</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Ukraine</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Armour to Armenia</td>\n<td align=\"left\">24 056</td>\n<td align=\"left\">5 871</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Equipment to Armenia</td>\n<td align=\"left\">10 604</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3 023</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Armour to Azerbaijan</td>\n<td align=\"left\">57 671</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14 075</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Equipment to Azerbaijan</td>\n<td align=\"left\">63 976</td>\n<td align=\"left\">18 238</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Killed per day Armenia</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14 195</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14 195</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Killed per day Azerbaijan</td>\n<td align=\"left\">12 792</td>\n<td align=\"left\">12 792</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>For total casualties it seems entirely reasonable to multiply these numbers by 4, as the 3-1 WIA-to-KIA ratio seems to hold.</p>\n\n<p>The point of this exercise to get an idea of the plausible scale of losses for the war. The particular comparisons are very subject to differences in reporting and documentation.</p>\n\n<p>For example if Armenia documented 80% of their equipment losses and Ukraine 40%, then the Ukranian KIA losses would be 2x higher than showed in this table.</p>\n\n<p>If an army is armour heavy (as the main bulk of the Russian professional army is), it will likely look worse in the armour-loss category than a lightly armed infantry army (like Ukrainian TDF, or DNR/LNR mobilized mass). A completely unarmoured force, that loses no armoured vehicles would have a KIA assessment of 0 in that cell.</p>\n</div>",

Even after embarrassing performances in Chechnya and Georgia. The 2008 initiated reforms were meant to do what you're talking about, and they were cut short and largely undone when Shoigu replaced Serdyukov.\n\n>Look at what Iran has managed to accomplish despite the sanctions, and Russia has way more resources than them;\n\nRussia could become a regional player like Iran, feeding proxy groups to nip away at their rivals.

Especially given how Russian rhetoric has escalated since the war began. If they'd kept the goal as pacifying the Donbass or something, that could be achievable. But the domestic rhetoric is about complete victory over Ukraine. That will be a very difficult goal to accomplish.

The core of its modern army will be in ruins and they frankly lack the industrial capacity to replace it. Production of modern equipment came to a shrieking halt in 2014, and even *if* they can get meaningful access to large amounts of advanced machining tools, electronics, etc, their military is going to take a *long, long* time to replenish its losses of modern equipment.\n\n>The military learns their lessons and eliminates the inefficiencies, they recruit hundreds of thousands of soldiers who get real-world combat experience.\n\nWhat hundreds of thousands of soldiers? They're already scraping the bottom of the barrel for volunteers, and they lack the old Soviet institutions and industry to raise, train, and equip a massive army. Not to mention that their training personnel are being fed into this conflict, basically destroying their seed grain.\n\nCombat experience isn't that useful if there aren't any institutions capable of processing that raw data, identifying useful lessons, and formatting that into coherent new doctrine.

This back and forth was [widely publicized](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/biden-says-military-not-support-nancy-pelosi-visit-taiwan-rcna39259) and created a spectacle that both demanded a response from Beijing as well as gave them easily exploitable ammunition for their domestic audience. Rather than setting a clear and consistent tone and coordinating with Pelosi, Biden basically told the Pentagon to shut up, and mumbled through the visit talking about separation of powers right after Biden's 2 hour phone call with Xi. There's at least an *expectation* that the Speaker and the White House (who are from the same political party and are as \"establishment\" as one could imagine) would coordinate around foreign policy. What kind of messaging does it send to our allies if the White House and Speaker can't even agree on basic things such as a trip to Taiwan when they're from the *same political party.*   \nHow different would the visit been if Biden had taken an actual strong position such as \"we often discourage high-level visits to Taiwan as they're not productive for our overall relationship and tensions in the region; however, a one-time visit every 25 years by a speaker? what's the harm?\"   \nBy not aligning on a consistent approach to Taiwan, or, at the very least managing the media narrative (something the Biden admin has done a very poor job of across a broad range of issues), you allow Chinese media takes to flourish. The Chinese have been fairly consistent in their propaganda angle that \"US politicians are self-interested and will sacrifice global peace, security, and prosperity to further their own interests\" (paraphrasing but you get my point), and the public debate around Pelosi played directly into their hands. \n\n>Actually don't take my word from it, take Chinese foreign minister Mang Yi:  \nSome U.S. politicians only care about their self-interests, blatantly play with fire on the Taiwan question, make themselves enemies of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, and will definitely end up in no good place\n\nThis type of narrative hurts credibility with partner nations across the pacific who fear that inconsistency in US foreign policy caused by domestic political infighting can hamper or hinder support on various issues.\n\n  \n**Also, could you expand on what the incoherent US policy towards Asia is?**  \nI don't want to go too into detail here but these two podcasts give a pretty good overview of some of the flaws and incoherence of US policy towards Asia \n\n[link](https://warontherocks.com/2022/02/the-pacific-is-not-so-pacific/) and [link](https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/active-denial-or-in-denial/)  \nOne of the key points I will make; however, is that the US policy in the Pacific is viewed almost entirely through the lens of great power competition with China. While this is certainly understandable, it comes at the cost of undercutting our pacific allies and partners who, frankly, do not want to be paws in a great power competition they have little interest in actually fighting. This is not Europe in the 1960s. The United States does not enjoy the same economic and political dominance and instead must understand the complex interlocking needs, wants, and requirements of littoral partners in the pacific that are essential to countering China. \n\nA great example of this is actually Taiwan where the US is driving towards clarity in its commitment to Taiwan and is expecting partners and allies to do the same. This benefits some partners of course (australia for example) but other countries have long enjoyed the benefits conferred by a more ambiguous approach to security commitments to Taiwan. In other words, this clear commitment by the US heavily constrains our partners who often have to basically manage complex relationship with various regional stakeholders and nations as well as balance public domestic opinion in democratic, semi-democratic, and even authoritarian states. \n\nAs a small tidbit there's even bizarre things such as the Biden admin not even nominating ambassadors to key [posts](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/biden-administration-hasnt-nominated-anyone-ambassador-south-korea-cri-rcna8984) and yet this region is supposed to be the most critical foreign policy focus.",

        "body": "Special Volunteer Operation  \nHow Regions Form Units to Participate in the Special Military Operation in Ukraine  \nkommersant.ru/doc/5501970\n\nAt the end of last week, it became known about the formation of three \"named\" volunteer units in St. Petersburg to participate in a special military operation (SMO) in Ukraine. The formation of such detachments has been going on in the regions for several months already. Local authorities and veterans' organizations are calling for volunteers to join them. Volunteers are being promised generous monetary payments and all the necessary equipment. Procedural questions are solved through military registration and enlistment offices where volunteers sign contracts with the Defense Ministry. As a rule, such units consist of compatriots, who train together and have to take part in combat operations together.\n\nInformation about creation of volunteer detachments \"Kronstadt\", \"Neva\" and \"Pavlovsk\" in St. Petersburg appeared on August 4 in the \" Vkontakte \" page called \"Selection point for military service under contract\". According to the announcement, these units are staffed \"exclusively by residents of St. Petersburg\".\n\nThe formation of such detachments is underway in the regions since spring: Kommersant calculates that at least two dozen regions have already established more than 40 such units.\n\nInformation about them is published in the media and social networks of the authorities, and they are given special names which somehow indicate their territorial affiliation. As a rule, these units are composed of residents of the region where they are formed, who train together, get combat ready, and then are sent together to the SMO.\n\nSo, in Yakutia, the volunteer unit is called \"Bootur\" - according to local legends, Ellay Bootur is considered to be the forefather of the Yakuts. On July 28 in his Telegram-channel the head of the republic Aysen Nikolayev wrote about their imminent dispatch to SMO \"for liberation of friendly republics, strengthening the borders and defense of our country\". According to the commander of the Bootur, Alexander Kolosov, it includes drivers, mechanics, air defense gunners and machine gunners.\n\n\"The main principle that we are forming here is compatriotism ... The battalion will come to its fellow countrymen prepared and will be a good support for the military units participating in the special operations in Ukraine,\" Governor Oleg Kozhemyako described the tasks of the Tiger Primorye detachment. The new battalion was announced on July 9 by the press service of the regional government. Its fighters are being trained at the base of the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet.\n\n\"The idea is that the battalions should be formed only from natives of Tatarstan so they could form a line side by side, know each other, go together and fulfill their tasks,\" Major Yevgeny Tokmakov, head of the Kazan contract military service selection point, explained the principle of forming the Alga and Timer (Tatar for \"Forward\" and \"Iron\") battalions. Liliya Galimova, press secretary to the President of Tatarstan, claimed that this initiative was born \"out of a call of the heart\": \"As far as I understand, it was the citizens who were directly involved in this project. I haven't heard any appeals from the republic's leaders. The Tatar battalions have their own Telegram channel, where they periodically publish agitational videos. \"I am Alexei. Every day I work in the field in my native Volzhsk,\" says in one of them a volunteer getting into a BMP. \"I'm Bulat, an IT specialist from Nizhnekamsk. I develop software for large companies in the city,\" says another.\n\nWhen enrolling in the Chuvash communications battalion \"Atal\" (Chuvash for \"Volga\"), which is also open only to residents of the republic, knowledge of the Chuvash language is considered a plus. In order to sign the contract no experience of military service is required, but a telecommunications education or a driver's license category B, C, D, E.\n\nIn the Perm Krai, the Parma motorized rifle company of 90 men and the Molot tank battalion (about 160 men) are being formed. Another tank battalion named after Kuzma Minin is being formed in the Nizhny Novgorod Region. The local mass media reported in mid-July that the Amur Region is assembling the Amur motorized rifle battalion which is expected to consist of 400-500 people. The government of the Leningrad Region posted on its website an announcement about recruitment for the Nevsky and Ladozhsky artillery divisions. The Tyumen Region announced the formation of three units with different specializations: the bomb disposal battalion Tobol, the sniper company Taiga, and the artillery division Sibir. According to the official version, Tobol was formed on the initiative of veterans of the Tyumen Higher Military Engineering Command School. The first groups of volunteers from these units left for the SMO at the end of July.",

The local mass media reported in mid-July that the Amur Region is assembling the Amur motorized rifle battalion which is expected to consist of 400-500 people. The government of the Leningrad Region posted on its website an announcement about recruitment for the Nevsky and Ladozhsky artillery divisions. The Tyumen Region announced the formation of three units with different specializations: the bomb disposal battalion Tobol, the sniper company Taiga, and the artillery division Sibir. According to the official version, Tobol was formed on the initiative of veterans of the Tyumen Higher Military Engineering Command School. The first groups of volunteers from these units left for the SMO at the end of July.</p>\n</div>",

The first one, named after Minigali Shaymuratov (a Soviet Bashkir commander during the Great Patriotic War) was announced back in May by the republican organization \"Veterans of Marines and Special Forces of the Navy\". And in June \"Veterans of airborne troops and special forces of Bashkortostan\" announced the creation of a battalion after Alexander Dostavlatov (Ufa citizen who died in the second Chechen war). The head of the republic, Rady Khabirov, said that the total strength of the two battalions exceeded 800 men.\n\nSupport units are being created in a number of regions.\n\nFor example, the logistics battalion Seim of the Kursk Oblast will be responsible for provision of fuel, food, ammunition etc. The Omsk Region has announced the formation of a repair company, a material support company and a medical unit called Irtysh, Avangard and Om. The most in demand there are auto mechanics, logisticians, forwarders, foremen, and paramedical personnel. According to Omsk authorities at the beginning of last week, 150 applications for service have been received, 50 people have already been selected and included in the order, and another 400 people have called the contact number and declared their willingness to join the named battalions.\n\nOther \"named\" units include Angara (Irkutsk region), the Chelyabinsk battalions Yuzhnouralets (261 people) and Southern Urals (253 people), the Tomsk Toyan (named after the prince of the tribe of Eushtin Tatars who lived on the banks of the Tom river in the 17th century). The Ulyanovsk battalions Sviyaga (the river flowing through Ulyanovsk) and Simbirsk are each expected to have 200 fighters. According to Maksim Korzhov, deputy head of the central recruitment point in Ulyanovsk, interest in signing contracts is \"very high\": more than 100 calls a day are received.\n\nIn Krasnodar Krai, volunteer units are formed on the basis of the Kuban Cossack Troops. Back in April, a detachment named after Zakhary Chepiga, ataman of the Black Sea Cossack Troops, was created there, and in May - the Kuban detachment. In total, about 1.2 thousand Cossacks are involved in the SMO, and a special center for training of Cossack volunteers is functioning in the Krasnoyarsk territory. In addition, on July 22, the website of the Union of Cossack Warriors of Russia and Foreign Countries published information on the reorganization of the Cossack detachment \"Don\" into a brigade and on joining there with the Terek battalion. The new brigade must also include the Kuban and Yenisei units. The media reported earlier about participation of the Yermak and Tavrida Cossack units in the SMO.\n\nProcedural formalities in all the regions are the responsibility of the Defense Ministry: volunteers sign contracts with it for a period of several months with the possibility of extension and obtain the official status of contract servicemen.\n\nEarlier in an interview Governor Kozhemyako of Primorye described a scheme typical of many constituent entities of the Russian Federation for distribution of duties in forming regbats: in the case of \"Tiger\" ammunition (body armor and helmets) is supplied by the Pacific Fleet, the region takes care of clothes and special equipment (\"various scopes, radios, quadrocopters\"), and weapons are provided by the Defense Ministry.\n\nThe payments promised to volunteers vary from region to region. For example, in the Omsk region they say that after their arrival on the territory of the Defense Forces the contract servicemen will be paid at least 130 thousand rubles. In other regions, they report higher figures exceeding 200 thousand rubles. And in Perm Krai, volunteers are promised not less than 300 thousand rubles a month. The regional authorities, in turn, are ready for one-time payments (starting from 100 thousand rubles), but they are not always available right away. For example, in Tatarstan, the volunteers are promised to get only 60,000 rubles right away, and they will get 200,000 rubles after crossing the border. In addition, the contract servicemen are entitled to various payments for successful combat operations and daily allowances of 8,000 rubles \"for each day of the offensive. \" Regional additional payments are also provided in the event of death of volunteers: for example, in Bashkiria, their families are promised 12.3 million rubles each.\n\nChechnya had started to form such named military units consisting of local residents long before the events in Ukraine, and they took part in the SMO since the early days. Particularly, these are the OMON riot squads and SOBR \"Akhmat\" (named after Akhmat Kadyrov, the Chechen president in 2003-2004), the battalion \"South,\" and the 141st motorized regiment named after Akhmat-Khadzhi Kadyrov. At the end of June the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov announced the formation of four new battalions for participation in the North Caucasus Military District: \"North-Akhmat\", \"South-Akhmat\", \"West-Akhmat\" and \"East-Akhmat\".\n\nA knowledgeable federal official has told Kommersant on the condition of anonymity that the contract troops are formed on a territorial basis, since this makes it more convenient to work with volunteers.\n\nThe regional authorities, he said, were asked to provide information support first and foremost, they also help with finances and fundraising for additional logistical support. When Kommersant was asked if there would be any problems with such units at the place of their formation after the SMO, the Kommersant interlocutor replied: \"The principle of the lesser evil is applied here.

He points at the one he thinks is the most important, that becomes the strategic main effort. They get the most of everything, while everyone is left to perform supporting operations, maximizing what they have to make the best of it to complete a limited objective. They do that until the strategic goal for the main effort is accomplished or else they change it. \n\nOtherwise it means Zelensky and the GenStab picking three main efforts (defend the Donbas, protect Kharkiv, and retake Kherson) while not having the force structure to do them all, then blaming NATO for not giving them enough. Nope, it's just bad management.\n\nThere is a story attributed to Napoleon, if memory serves, of seeing a map with forces spread out evenly across a border and remarking whether the intent is to catch smugglers.\n\nA more modern version is the debate about Eisenhower's choice in the fall 1944, broad front vs narrow thrust. \n\nSame issue, nobody can do everything at once everywhere unless they GROSSLY outnumber the enemy in manpower and resources.

He points at the one he thinks is the most important, that becomes the strategic main effort. They get the most of everything, while everyone is left to perform supporting operations, maximizing what they have to make the best of it to complete a limited objective. They do that until the strategic goal for the main effort is accomplished or else they change it. </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise it means Zelensky and the GenStab picking three main efforts (defend the Donbas, protect Kharkiv, and retake Kherson) while not having the force structure to do them all, then blaming NATO for not giving them enough. Nope, it&#39;s just bad management.</p>\n\n<p>There is a story attributed to Napoleon, if memory serves, of seeing a map with forces spread out evenly across a border and remarking whether the intent is to catch smugglers.</p>\n\n<p>A more modern version is the debate about Eisenhower&#39;s choice in the fall 1944, broad front vs narrow thrust. </p>\n\n<p>Same issue, nobody can do everything at once everywhere unless they GROSSLY outnumber the enemy in manpower and resources. The UAF most certainly doesn&#39;t. So if they want to do well somewhere they have to mass, or else be content doing poorly everywhere by spreading themselves thin.</p>\n</div>",

                                "body": ">I think you're conflating an attack in the Kharkiv area with an offensive.\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/thestudyofwar/status/1522375138641072128?lang=en\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/JominiW/status/1531802120462209025\n\nhttps://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2022/04/17/7340296/ \n\nI'm repeating what EVERYONE besides you called the +6 brigade coordinated attack to 1) Push Russians outside of standard artillery range of Kharkiv itself 2) Threaten to cut Russian GLOC to Izyum from Belgorod forcing them to respond with heavy reinforcements (that wouldn't be able to use in the Donbas). \n\nWhich is exactly what happened. The issue was whether it was worth it, because that investment cost the UAF a near permanent corps sized force of good units they need to keep the gains they made around Kharkiv.\n\n>Russians left a token force there even by your own account.\n\nBefore the counteroffensive it was a quiet sector because Russia wasn't attacking and neither were the Ukrainians. After it started, it wasn't. What changed? The Ukrainians launched a major attack, massed a larger force against a smaller force, hit a Russian weak point, surfaces and gaps. \n\n>In that case, you can call every minor battle or maneuver in this war an 'offensive' and muddy the idea behind it. Also, ironically, you're giving UAF more credit here than I do.\n\nA coordinated +6 brigade operation to push the Russians back 40 km to outside Ukraine territory, across a river, and threatening to cut their lines of communication is an operational level campaign encompassing a very large area of operations with individual battles occurring as part of it, such as the fighting over Staryi Saltiv.\n\nManeuver means movement, which means retreating or attacking. If done at the tactical level, division or below, it's an attack or counterattack. If it's done as part of a campaign at the operational level  (corps to army group equivalent), it's an operational counteroffensive. If done at the theater level targeting strategic objectives, it's a strategic counteroffensive.\n\nThe Kharkiv and Kherson bridgehead offensives that started in April-May were operational counteroffensives. The large scale counteroffensive the UA govt keeps talking up is supposed to be strategic in scale (targeting the whole south) but it's confusing everyone because it's still only really focused on the Kherson bridgehead. \n\n>Also, ironically, you're giving UAF more credit here than I do.\n\nI have no problems giving them credit when they're do. I called those offensives out when they started and tried to draw focus on them when they were happened because they were supporting operations designed not only for their own operational purposes but to draw Russian focus away from it's own strategic main effort, capturing the Donbas. While not enough Russian forces were committed to prevent them from taking Luhansk they likely have been drained of surplus manpower and resources reinforcing diversionary fronts that they could probably have achieved more.\n\nHowever, the problem with doing diversionary supporting offensives is that the enemy aren't the only ones committing extra forces that can be used in the main effort, by launching offensives outside Kharkiv and against the Kherson bridgehead in late May the UAF were also overextending themselves, which is why everyone down in the trenches in the Donbas are complaining about doing too much with too little.\n\nOverextension is one of the top mistakes generals make in war. It's the opposite of being timid or negative, it's being overly overly aggressive and positive to the point they overestimate their own capabilities, spread themselves too thin. Both sides have been guilty of this during this war, in the past and now. \n\n>Deception in strategy is a possibility and especially pertinent in warfare.\n\nIf it's deception, it's done to suit a purpose, nearly always to draw the enemy's focus on the place you don't want him to be focusing on. If true, where are the UAF actually focusing? Kharkiv front? The Donbas? Only for defensive ops? What about offensive? \n\nRecently, the UAF have only launched offensive operations beyond battalion level against the Kherson bridgehead, which is the exact place they've been saying since early July they were going to launch a big counteroffensive against. When they say out loud what they're going to do, that's not deception, that's a briefing.",

Whether you\u2019re a professional, a hobbyist, or just someone who is interested in learning more about OSINT, drop by!</p>\n\n<p>We are also looking to start producing finished intelligence products based on the findings from our community!</p>\n\n<p>Here is a sample of some of the ongoing topics of investigation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using GEOINT to uncover a new mysterious tunnel linking China to Afghanistan.</li>\n<li>Geolocating journalists in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Determining if a recent rocket attack video, purportedly in Israel, is opportunistic propaganda or real.</li>\n<li>Attempting to decipher some popular internet mysteries (Cicada 3301, Lake City Quiet Pills, etc.)</li>\n<li>Discussing emergent cyber threat actors, cyberattacks, hacks, and more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope to see you there!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/XByYQkZAwB\">https://discord.gg/XByYQkZAwB</a></p>\n</div>",
