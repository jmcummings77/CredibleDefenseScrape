As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

There have been plenty of complaints by the mobiks that the DNR/LNR people were too tough and demanding.

He got the pick of Rosgvardia volunteers of much higher quality than regular mobilised citizen-soldiers.\n\nDespite the heavy attrition some units still continue to perform significantly above the level of the rest of the Russian army - the Kaskad regiment, the Vostok battalion, the Somalia battalion and several low-numbered brigades (high-numbered brigades were DNR/LNR mobiks and I don't know whether they exist as separate units any more).",

        "body": "[This article](https://unherd.com/2023/07/dodging-shells-on-ukraines-eastern-front/) contained such a throw-away line but that line made me intensely interested in the internal politics of where do the supplied weapons and resources go.\n\nThe interview is with the Dnipro-1 battalion, which is special in its own rights. \u201cWe are proud that Dnipro 1 was the first volunteer battalion to form in 2014 to fight the Russians.\u201d\n\n>Bereza got a call. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking give me excuses! Don\u2019t tell me what the situation is here. I am here \u2014 I tell you what the situation is!\u201d he bellowed into his phone. \u201cWe are fighting intensely, and you don\u2019t give us machine guns or snipers? Every day we let the Russians escape. Why can\u2019t we put machine guns in position? Why do I have to wait days for this shit? Where are my fucking weapons?\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201cThis is the way it works. First, lend-lease \\[equipment\\] goes to Special Forces. Second, to the airborne brigades. Third, to operative units of the National Guard. Then, if something is left over, it comes to us. But it never does. There are a lot of weapons in the country \u2014 we know which units have them. But the way the general staff share them is not the best. Sometimes weapons are given to troops who are not prepared. It\u2019s the result of bad decision-making.\u201d\n\nThe Armed Force of Ukraine, which is under the Ministry of Defence, has the following branches:  Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Air Assault Force (VDV), Special Operations Forces (SSO), and Territorial Defence Force (TDF). As you can see, the Army, Marines, VDV, SSO, and TDFs are all ground elements and they are separate branches in the same way that Army, Navy and Air Force are separate branches.\n\nThe so-called \"volunteer unit/battalion/regiment/brigade\" (they have shifting nominal unit size names), like Azov, Donbas, Kruk, Kulchitskyi, and Dnipro-1 are under the National Guard of Ukraine, which is in turn, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. This Ministry is separate from the Ministry of Defence, in the same way that the Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) is different from the Armed Forces of Russia under Russia's Ministry of Defence. So when Western news media say that the volunteer units like Azov are \"incorporated into the armed forces of Ukraine\" it's such a weasel phrasing. They are nominally under some kind of government Ministry, but they are separate and have always been separate from the Ministry of Defence, the Army, and the rest.\n\nThe Discord leaks named 9 \"NATO-trained brigades\" by name: 47th, 33rd, 21st, 32nd, 37th, 118th, 117th and 82nd brigades. 47th, 33rd , 21st, 32nd are brand new Army brigades. 37th is the Marines. 117th, 118th are probably the TDF brigades. The Ukrainian VDV contributes the 82nd brigade.\n\nSo the statement by the Dnipro-1 battalion commander indicated that the priority goes: SSO --> VDV --> Operative Units of the National Guards --> Volunteer units of the National Guards. By the fact that NATO training and equipment have gone to the mechanised brigades of the Army, Marines, VDV and TDF, I'll say that that these branches of the Ministry of Defence have higher priority than the National Guards.\n\nBut what are the \"Operative Units of the National Guards\"? Wikipedia page named a number of them:  1st \"Bureviy\" (Storm), 3rd Spartan, 4th Rubizh, 12th Operational, 13th Khartia, 14th Chervona Kalyna, 15th Kara-Dag, 45th Operational. These appear to be the \"[Offensive/Assault Guard](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-recruitment-offensive-guard/32334123.html)\" brigades of the National Guard that were \"rebranded\" around Feb/March. For reference, the NATO-trained brigades started their training in January or so. Azov has been named and not named as part of the Offensive Guard. These are \"On a training ground outside Kyiv this month, newcomers to the Bureviy Brigade -- Ukrainian for \"storm,\" though some members say it's an acronym for Brigade for the Elimination of Russian Soldiers -- were being put through a comprehensive training program based on NATO standards, first on the individual, then group, and finally unit level\"; so it looks like they are more home-grown. So the re-branded brigades of the NG have higher priority than some of the OGs.\n\nSo right now, it looks like the Zelensky government, the Ministry of Defence (Oleksii Reznikov as the Minister), and the Armed Force of Ukraine (commanded by Valerii Zaluzhnyi) are prioritising the units under the Ministry of Defence and not the National Guards. I hope this means that the Ukrainian government is really clipping the strength and influence of the volunteer battalions. Well, they are perhaps not all volunteers; again, from Dnipro-1:\n\n>\u201cAlso \u2014 and we don\u2019t like to admit it, but I will \u2014 the quality of the new soldiers is getting worse. Before it was just volunteers, now it\u2019s conscripts and they\u2019re not so motivated. Before, when we lost comms with the troops, we knew they wouldn\u2019t abandon the positions. But now we need to coordinate every step \u2014 speaking constantly to the sergeants to micro-manage everything.\u201d\n\nFinally, I found out this about the previous commander of the National Guard of Ukraine:\n\n>Mykola Balan resigned as commander of the National Guard of Ukraine due to a shooting involving servicemen in Dnipro, Ukraine\n\nWhat? [The incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dnipro_shooting):\n\n>The killings occurred on 27 January 2022, at about 3:40 a.m. in the city of Dnipro, as guards began handing out weapons to the servicemen at Yuzhmash factory.\\[3\\] A National Guard of Ukraine conscript armed with a reported AK-47 assault rifle\\[4\\]\\[1\\] shot dead four male servicemen and one civilian woman,\\[a\\] and wounded five others. Two soldiers of the twenty-two soldiers present managed to escape and call an ambulance and policemen. The shooter fled the scene with his weapon. At about 9.30 am, he was detained in the town of Pidhorodne after he reported himself to the police.\n\nMykola Balan appears to now be the [Deputy Commander-In-Chief Of Ukrainian Armed Forces](https://ukranews.com/en/news/852378-national-guard-ex-commander-balan-appointed-as-deputy-commander-in-chief-of-ukrainian-armed-forces).\n\nDid he fail upwards or downwards? He used to command an entirely separate armed organisation and now he's the vice commander of a much larger armed force. If I were to plan a coup, I'll pick the National Guards, but for pure military commanding stuffs, I'll go with the Armed Forces.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://unherd.com/2023/07/dodging-shells-on-ukraines-eastern-front/\">This article</a> contained such a throw-away line but that line made me intensely interested in the internal politics of where do the supplied weapons and resources go.</p>\n\n<p>The interview is with the Dnipro-1 battalion, which is special in its own rights. \u201cWe are proud that Dnipro 1 was the first volunteer battalion to form in 2014 to fight the Russians.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bereza got a call. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking give me excuses! Don\u2019t tell me what the situation is here. I am here \u2014 I tell you what the situation is!\u201d he bellowed into his phone. \u201cWe are fighting intensely, and you don\u2019t give us machine guns or snipers? Every day we let the Russians escape. Why can\u2019t we put machine guns in position? Why do I have to wait days for this shit? Where are my fucking weapons?\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is the way it works. First, lend-lease [equipment] goes to Special Forces. Second, to the airborne brigades. Third, to operative units of the National Guard. Then, if something is left over, it comes to us. But it never does. There are a lot of weapons in the country \u2014 we know which units have them. But the way the general staff share them is not the best. Sometimes weapons are given to troops who are not prepared. It\u2019s the result of bad decision-making.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Armed Force of Ukraine, which is under the Ministry of Defence, has the following branches:  Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Air Assault Force (VDV), Special Operations Forces (SSO), and Territorial Defence Force (TDF). As you can see, the Army, Marines, VDV, SSO, and TDFs are all ground elements and they are separate branches in the same way that Army, Navy and Air Force are separate branches.</p>\n\n<p>The so-called &quot;volunteer unit/battalion/regiment/brigade&quot; (they have shifting nominal unit size names), like Azov, Donbas, Kruk, Kulchitskyi, and Dnipro-1 are under the National Guard of Ukraine, which is in turn, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. This Ministry is separate from the Ministry of Defence, in the same way that the Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) is different from the Armed Forces of Russia under Russia&#39;s Ministry of Defence. So when Western news media say that the volunteer units like Azov are &quot;incorporated into the armed forces of Ukraine&quot; it&#39;s such a weasel phrasing.

It seems to me that a lot of assumptions have been made about the quantity of equipment and munitions available to Russia that appear to be inaccurate. It also feels like a lot of assumptions have been made about the level and longevity of Western commitment to Ukraine that haven't panned out either. \n\nSo why is the expectation that Russia would win a war of attrition against Ukraine? Because it's a much bigger country with a population that is several times larger? Because it has deeper stockpiles of old equipment to draw on? None of that really seems to support such an argument in my opinion. \n\nRussian stockpiles of equipment are enormous, but its manufacturing base is pretty small, and much of the equipment has been incredibly poorly maintained. So as a result, they appear to be hitting multiple bottlenecks related to restoring equipment from their \"inexhaustible\" stockpiles. In other words, they're losing AFVs, especially tanks, at an unsustainable rate. Conversely, there's little evidence that Ukraine is running out of tanks. In fact, they likely have more tanks at this point than when the war started thanks to donations from their foreign backers as well as from Russia itself. \n\nAs for munitions, it's hard to tell exactly how much artillery ammunition Russia has available and how much they're able to produce. They do appear to still be firing more rounds on average than Ukraine does, but with a key caveat. Namely that the accuracy of Russian longrange fires is significantly worse than that of Ukraine. Does it really matter that you can fire 3 times as many artillery rounds as your opponent, if your opponent still manages to knock out more of your equipment and personnel with fewer fires? The only major question I have here is how long the West will be able to provide ammunition to Ukraine at the current rate. If this can be maintained indefinitely, or even increased, Russia is likely to be in serious trouble. \n\nAs for population size, that really doesn't matter as much in this conflict as it's not really a war between just Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine has the benefit of receiving aid (both military and monetary) from dozens of countries that cannot be targeted by Russia directly. So long as Ukraine is able to maintain its ability to keep large armies in the field, they're going to be in a good position to win the war in the long run in my opinion. Russia might be better positioned to keep the manpower of their armies better topped off, but that will matter little if their mobiks have ever smaller quantities of equipment (and older and crappier equipment at that) as the war grinds on.",
