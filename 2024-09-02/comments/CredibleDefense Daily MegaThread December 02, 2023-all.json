            "body": "I'll try to answer these as best I can.\n\nExperience - I was a USMC tanker in the early 2000's on the M1A1, during which I did two tours in Iraq. I was enlisted, so my knowledge base (to the extent I still remember it) is operator level. While we did still train for tank-on-tank warfare, much of our training was COIN-based. I have no personal experience with any other NATO tank models, so I don't have any real basis to compare the M1A1 with, say, Leopard or Challenger. \n\nThe M1A1 is a magnificent machine. In my experience the greatest attribute was its accuracy, which I would characterize as pinpoint. We trained to hit car sized targets out to about 4km, and a well trained crew could accomplish this fairly easily. The coaxial machine gun is stabilized alongside the main cannon and effectively can be used as a sniper rifle in addition to normal suppressive fire. \n\nI don't know exactly what night optics the Ukrainians are getting, but if it's what we had (which, being the USMC, was not the best the military as a whole had as the Army was already up to M1A2), the night vision is much, much better than Cold-war era systems. It's so sensitive that we could often tell where vehicles had recently driven because of the subtle heat changes on the roadway from tire friction. When I first started we had the previous generation \"green\" sights, and the advantage of good thermals cannot be overstated in firing first. \n\nIt is also an extremely well protected vehicle. Vehicle losses were not unheard of. But although there were a few serious injuries, KIA were very rare - the only one that comes to mind was a TC who was well outside the hatch and was hit by shrapnel. I have seen entire crews walk away from vehicles that would not look survivable to lay observers. Now, of course, we were not facing modern ATGM's, but the IEDs should not be discounted. Some of them were absolutely massive and both intended and fully capable of taking out a modern MBT.\n\nFuel: the M1 is a gas hog, there's no way around it. We were indeed trained that the M1 can run on just about anything that burns - diesel, gasoline, kerosene, etc. I have no personal experience with that, nor have I ever heard of anyone who does - even in the most remote FOBs in Iraq, we never had any shortage of JP8 - that's just the nature of American logistics. One thing that I think people forget is that while the Abrams uses a lot of fuel, it carries a lot too - about 500 gallons in multiple fuel tanks IIRC. It's not like it needs to be refueled every hour or something like that, and is perfectly capable of running a combat op and driving back to a rear refueling station. \n\nTo me, the general logistics intensity of the platform is its biggest weakness. Not just fuel, but especially spare parts. They did need a lot of maintenance. It's such a heavy vehicle that you are constantly working to keep the track in good order. The reality of 70 tons rumbling down the road is that bits of metal are just always going to be breaking. I should add that while the Abrams requires a lot of man-hours of maintenance work, most can be done in the field. If you have an M88, it is not difficult to pull the engine pack in field conditions, for example. But things do break a lot and if you don't have good logistics for spares you will not have a tank force for very long.\n\nI'm hesitant to compare the Abrams to other MBTs because I have no personal experience with other MBTs. The only thing I can say is that I have been inside (but not actively operated) old Soviet models, and they are VERY uncomfortable compared to the Abrams, which is not that comfortable itself. \n\nMy knowledge of vehicles like T-64's probably does not much exceed others on this forum. The Abrams advantages are going to be, as I said earlier, accuracy and survivability. I doubt there is any tank in the world (maybe the latest Merkava) that protects its crew better.",

                "body": "At least one .50 is essential, which is why you see it mounted on many tanks (in my opinion)\n\nThe more complex answer is what do you intend to do with that MG. A 7.62 will typically let you mount more guns (see the Abrams with hella M240s)/carry more ammo/lighten up vs. a similar .50 armament. And a pintle mounted 7.62 is good for hitting infantry out to 1000m. So if you just want to clear a treeline, a pintle 7.62 plus the coax is good enough, if you can get in a little closer. But a .50 is needed if you want to put holes in things, shoot out a goodly range, or put holes in metal things. For example when considering MOUT the .50 is a real nice thing to have. Your standard 7.62 isn't going to give you that much more penetrating capability versus an infantry platoon, most of whom are going to be rocking that exact MG as their SAW/LMG option. But a .50 represents a significant increase in ballistic capabilities and is something uniquely suited to being carried on a vehicle, versus deployed as an old school HMG team. Put another way, a tank with its main gun and .50cal gives you a weapon you otherwise dont already have. Beyond MOUT, if you want to tackle lighter equipment, aircraft, or helos in close a .50 is the way to go. A BTR, for example, is proof against 7.62 in some arcs. It is not proof against a .50 in any arc. There you have a choice, do you want to hit some light truck or target with the main gun or would you like an option that will for sure punch through the body but will save the tank round. Likewise the range and power of a .50 is really what you want vs. something like a helo in a rocket attack. This is a pretty specific scenario, tho a big reason why the US has always put the .50 on everything, BUT with the rise of drone warfare the .50 will let you engage a close in observation drone from the hatch of your tank, a 7.62 will struggle. The .50 lets you reach out and touch things, touch them by punching them in the face. \n\nYou notice forces that engage in a lot of MOUT and complex combined arms ops carry many .50s. The US and the SAA are two examples. Whereas the German army, who hasn't stopped thinking about war with Russia in 100 years, mounts nearly the same MG (MG 3 vs. 42) they used in the 1940s. And note the Heer generally does not use a .50 of any sort. If focusing on mobile mechanized armored warfare the .50 is probably superfluous. But when thinking of complex operations in complex terrain, the .50 gives you things nothing else will. HMGs on vehicles, tanks and otherwise, are about the only way modern forces bring HMGs into battle these days in any capacity.",

L55), if I'm being honest, it's just outside my knowledge base to give you a real competent answer.\n\nI question the utility of moving to heavier rounds over 120mm. At some point, you're going to carry less ammo overall (or build an ever bigger and more unwieldy vehicle). This goes into your later question, but it also becomes harder for a manual loader. I don't think the Abrams current armament is underpowered, and I doubt there is a vehicle that can easily survive a hit from a 120mm sabot round currently in service.\n\nA 50 ton tank is going to have a few advantages - a lighter vehicle is going to be less maintenance and logistics intensive and more mobile. Barring some speciality situations (e.g. bridges that cannot support more than 50 tons and things like that), the main reason you would want the lighter tank is because that's what your logistics is capable of supporting. All else being equal, I don't know why you would ever want a lighter tank in a fight against a heavier one.\n\nManual vs. Auto loader is a hot topic right now. Personally, I favor the manual loader. Having a fourth crewmember is really valuable in a lot of different situations (more people to split up firewatch if nothing else). Also, loader is a VERY easy job (intellectually speaking). I could teach any adult of average intelligence to be a loader in a day. That means you can basically take anyone to be the loader - we often ran with a tank mechanic as our loader, which was helpful in all sorts of ways. I am also wary of added complexity. I know that a person can be wounded just as easily as an autoloader can break, but you still have extra redundancy because the TC can act as gunner while the gunner moves to loader.

                "body": "Not a tanker but I know the answers to these:\n\n> Do you feel like the L/44 gun have any practical disadvantage compared to the L/55 gun on Leo 2 and why didn't Abrams use L/55 too?\n\nThe development of the L/44 dates back to the 1950s and the US DELTA program, which was itself an offshoot of work being done in the UK around a 120mm gun. The Delta program was itself a radical revision of that work, and at the time it was hoped that it would eventually incorporate all kinds of nifty cool missile age tech (that naturally never panned out). One such feature is a round capable of course-correcting mid flight not a missile, really a semi-guided round. Nifty idea, never worked. When the US moved to the MBT-70 program they considered a variety of tank designs, including those equipped with the DELTA 120mm. That gun was a major upgrade over the British designed 105 that was currently on most NATO stock. The Germans liked this gun, as even outside of its wunderwaffen hairbrained ideas, it was still a solid gun with great characteristics and smooth handling. But the Americans preferred an even more better wunderwaffen, the 152mm gun/missile Shillelagh system which was already deployed on the M551 Sheridan and would soon roll out to the M60s in their A2 (Starship) configuration. Great idea, you can shoot guided missiles AND a huge HEAT/APDS/AP round. But it was shit in practice. Firing conventional rounds created so much recoil in the M551 that it frequently borked the missile firing computer, which then had to be reset. And the APDS KE round had a nasty habit of shattering, first in the barrel (bad) or later against thicker armor arrays (also bad). Its probably the case that the 152mm KE round would *not* have penetrated the front plate of a T-62 which was the standard array for the MBT project. Then there were other problems with the actual missile. The whole thing was bad. \n\nCa. 1969, Germany and the US decided to go their own way with tank development and that left a post-MBT70 German design (called Keller, which was a hybrid of the MBT70 and Leo 1) and the XM803, which was just the MBT-70 with a .50cal instead of a 20mm at the commanders hatch. But the XM803 increasingly looked out of date versus bigger and better Soviet tech appearing in Germany, so that was scrapped and the US did a full program restart leading to the XM1 project. The XM1 was designed to be three things, 1) better than the M60, 2) cheaper than the XM803, and 3) something that could be realistically acquired in the early 1980s timeframe. So it in several cases reduced risk by accepting legacy parts. The L7 105mm gun was one such example. Another example was with the Honeywell turbine which was new vs. the M60 but which had done quite well in the MBT-70 trials and had over a decade of work by the late 70s. The Germans, on the other hand, did not miss a step like the Americans did. The Leo2 that came out of the Keller project came together quickly and well, and was ready to go by 1979 in small quantities. And it came with the same 120mm gun as grew out of the MBT-70 project, now with a new name and back half and manufactured by Rhinemetall (who otherwise was very good at passing other companies R&D off as their own gold plated original).\n\nImportantly, the Americans well understood this was happening. They had nearly complete access to the tech files from the Keller project, a legacy of the MBT-70 tech sharing agreements, and knew the general direction the Germans were headed in. For much of the Leo2, the Americans were pleased but disinterested preferring their own homecooked design. But the gun was intriguing, and while they missed the boat in including it in the first buy of Abrams tanks, they *did* run a very successful upgrade program and converted, or acquired as new, 120mm L/44 armed M1s. Unfortunately for the US, Germany was at the same time looking to upgun its own Leo2s with an improved L/55, which could better take on the T-80s and later model T-72s then appearing in Germany. And here the US really did miss out, because by this point the tech sharing situation between the two powers had really begun to collapse. The US didn't know what the Germans planned to do, until the specimens were already in the field. Had the Cold War lasted another decade, perhaps we would have seen an L/55 Abrams. But it didnt, the threat of the USSR faded, AND the Abrams kicked shit in Iraq suggesting that further serious R&D was not necessary against the most likely future adversaries (Iraq again, or North Korea and their fleet of mostly \"upgraded\" T-64s). \n\n> Would tanks soon move to even more powerful 130/140mm guns or is it more efficient to use other things like missiles.\n\nMissile fired from tanks dont really work the same way as tank guns, particularly since the 1970s when KE became the best way to kill an enemy tank, not HEAT. Most tank armor is best suited against HEAT, and so many front attack missiles struggle. Moreover, the flight time to max range for a missile may be as long as 10 seconds. A KE penetrator can fly 5km in less than 3sec. You can dodge a TOW, with a little luck and skill. You cannot dodge an APFSDS round. Moreover, missiles fired from tanks tend to compromise both the gun performance AND the missile performance. Tanks are suboptimal control platforms with restricted fields of fire, and really its very bad to drill holes in the armor protection to add more sights and bullshit heading out. Youll notice on many mounted ATGM platforms that the missile and control unit are mounted high, with clear and free fields of fire in all directions. On a tank you would be low and heavily restricted by the turret's facing. \n\nBut thats not to say its just a totally bad idea, nobody would ever be so stupid, this is scifi tech. The US did it in the 1960s, and both the German and American militaries were so traumatized by that moment (for more reasons than just the missile) that this is something that has ever since not been something seriously considered. And both the British and French MBT fleet use weird guns that make missile systems more difficult. Plus they get good range and effect out of those systems, so why risk it? The Soviets, however, really struggled to make good guns and accurate optics. While Israeli tanks hit Syrian T-62s at 4km+ in 1973, the T-62 had to close to within 750m to get even a 50:50 against them. And the M1 vs. T-72 is even more lopsided. The M1 in its 1980s config had a 90% first round hit probability when stationary, and a 90% first hit kill probability. Bad odds for our Soviet tankman. The T-72 could manage some decent shooting out to 1000m, BUT it had to be stationary. And in most contemplated scenarios, the Soviets planned to be on the march and so fire on the move. Meaning their gunnery would be about as poor as the poor T-62 tanker in Syria. Missiles in this situation were a means to an end. Soviets wanted to be able to at least contest the 1-3km range bracket with something that could be reasonably accurate and reasonably effective BUT struggled to build a better gun-system to do so. So the missile, based on pretty simple tech by the 1970s, was an obvious solution. Soviet tank-missiles weren't great, actually they were pretty limited. But they could be fired from on the move and gave American tankers something to think about. Perhaps the best result, for the regiment on the advance, would be to force Americans to pull back behind a reverse slope to avoid incoming fire long enough for Soviet tanks to get into that 1000m or less sweet spot. At those ranges the later T-series tanks became competitive again with the Abrams and Leo2... in certain engagement zones. AFAIK the T-72 could not at any point pen the front turret armor of either tank at 1000m. But in other places things start looking up for the Soviet tankman again.",

Shoigu stated on December 1 during a conference call with Russian military leadership that Russian forces are conducting an \u201cactive defense\u201d in Ukraine and are capturing more advantageous positions in every operational direction.[6] Shoigu distinguished the 15th Motorized Rifle Brigade (2nd Combined Arms Army, Central Military District), 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade (1st Donetsk Peoples Republic [DNR] Army Corps), and the 4th and 123rd Motorized Rifle Brigades (both of the 2nd Luhansk People\u2019s Republic [LNR] Army Corps) for their service.[7] All of these elements are reportedly or likely operating in areas where Russian forces are conducting offensive operations in eastern Ukraine and not defending against Ukrainian counteroffensive operations in Zaporizhia Oblast.[8] Shoigu and Putin both previously called Russian offensive operations to capture Avdiivka an \"active defense\u201d following the failure of the first Russian mechanized push to achieve significant tactical gains in early October 2023.[9] Russian forces launched two subsequent large-scale pushes to capture Avdiivka since early October 2023 and continue a high tempo of attritional infantry assaults around the settlement.[10] Russian officials\u2019 characterization of these offensives as being part of an \"active defense\u201d are intentionally misleading. Ukrainian forces have never conducted offensive operations at scale in the Avdiivka area since the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Avdiivka has been a famously static Ukrainian defensive position since 2014. Russian leadership has nevertheless continued to falsely frame operations around Avdiivka as an \u201dactive defense\u201d likely to recontextualize the lack of any major Russian progress around Avdivka despite over two months of large-scale Russian attacks there.[11]\n\n> - **Russian President Vladimir Putin officially changed the composition of the Russian Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights (HRC) on December 1, removing several members and appointing a prominent anti-opposition media figure.** Putin signed a decree on December 1 that officially removed Russian lawyers Genri Reznik and Shota Gorgadze, Novaya Gazeta journalist Leonid Nikitinsky, North Caucasus-based missing person's peacekeeping mission head Alexander Mukomolov, and Independent Expert Legal Counsel head Mara Polyakov.[20] Neither the text of the decree nor Russian media offered explanations for the removal of the aforementioned HRC members. The decree also notably nominates \"public figure\" Alexander Ionov to the HRC, along with several other Russian civil society figures.[21] Russian opposition media noted that Ionov has been a member of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service since 2021 and that Ionov lodged successful appeals against Russian opposition outlets Meduza and The Bell, after which the Russian Ministry of Justice designated the outlets as \"foreign agents.\"[22] The US Treasury has sanctioned Ionov since July 2022 for his role in supporting \"the Kremlin's global negative influence operations and election interference efforts.\"[23] Putin last changed the composition of the HRC in November 2022, which ISW assessed was an effort to stifle domestic opposition and give prominence to figures who propagate the Kremlin's major informational lines.[24]\n\n> - **Russian milbloggers claimed that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD)\u2019s disproportionate allocation of drones among frontline units and poorly-executed grassroots drone production campaigns are impacting frontline unit effectiveness.** Russian milbloggers complained on December 1 that some decentralized grassroots campaigns aimed at arming Russian frontline units with new drones are failing to design battlefield-effective drones, sometimes developing \u201ctoys\u201d instead of weapons.[33] The milbloggers complained that Russian drone manufacturers base the development of new drones on stylized and cinematic battlefield footage of Russian kamikaze drones striking Ukrainian equipment, resulting in these ineffective \u201ctoy\u201d drones that can produce cinematic effects but struggle to further tactical objectives. The milbloggers claimed that the strikes that such footage depict are often \u201cpretty\u201d but ineffective, and claimed that Russian frontline units must conduct such strikes and produce such footage for the Russian MoD and grassroots drone manufacturers to continue allocating drones to those units.[34] These complaints are indicative of the struggles that the Russian MoD and other states with a highly centralized system face when implementing and integrating technological advances onto the battlefield. ISW has observed no indications that these frontline drone struggles have significantly impacted Russian military capabilities in Ukraine. The Russian milbloggers largely appear to focus on reiterating common complaints about the MoD prioritizing idealized lies that obfuscate harsh battlefield realities at the expense of Russian military personnel.[35] One milblogger claimed that the worst impact of these ineffective drones was that their ineffectiveness threatens frontline Russian soldiers.[36]\n\n> - **Russian sources complained that Russian soldiers' continued use of personal electronics and messaging apps in frontline areas is jeopardizing Russian operational security (OPSEC).** A prominent pro-Russian \"hacktivist\" released an alleged Ukrainian intelligence report on November 30 that shows Ukrainian intercepts of Russian personal communications from one day on one sector of the front.[37] The Russian source complained that this alleged report is relatively small compared to other such reports the source has obtained and complained that all WhatsApp and other messages that Russian military personnel send end up in Ukrainian interceptions, including documents, conversation screenshots, and media files.[38] One Russian milblogger responded to this post and claimed that neither warnings nor \"detailed lectures\" on the dangers of using WhatsApp and SMS systems in combat areas appear to affect Russian soldiers\u2019 communication habits. The source concluded that \"WhatsApp is killing\" Russian personnel and that commanders need to crack down on Russian personnel\u2019s use of these applications.[39] Another milblogger responded that Russian soldiers' use of WhatsApp informs Ukraine where Russian forces are going to attack.[40] Russian units have continually struggled with proper adherence to OPSEC principles in key frontline and rear areas throughout the war thus far, particularly pertaining to personal cellphone use in combat areas.[41] The Russian military command largely blamed Russian cellphone use for a devastating Ukrainian strike on a concentration area in Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast, on New Years Eve 2022, and it appears as though Russian command has largely failed to remedy such issues over the course of the past year.[42]",

It is a front: a shadowy recruitment network run by the Russian military\u2019s main intelligence directorate, known as the GRU.\n\nBased on battlefield records and multiple interviews with Redut fighters and recruiters, the investigation provided an unprecedented look inside this secretive GRU program that at times resembles a hall of mirrors: contracts signed with nonexistent companies, fighters attached to military units on paper only, and in one case, a posthumous state award from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a Redut fighter of whom the Defense Ministry said it had no record.\n\nNow, RFE/RL is publishing additional records, testimony, and independent reporting by Schemes and Systema revealing the inner workings of this system, which Redut recruiters say offers multiple benefits for those who sign up \u2013 including the option to quit without the threat of a court-martial and the ability to earn cash that can be hidden from creditors, courts, and the government.\n\nRedut was created \u201cso that people could avoid paying taxes or, for example, any court costs,\u201d one recruiter told Systema.\n\nThis arrangement also allows the Russian government and military to maintain a layer of legal distance from the many fighters and units under the umbrella of this ostensibly private organization.\n\n\u201cRussia has faced big challenges with recruiting and retention because of the available pool of potential recruits being very low,\u201d Candace Rondeaux, a researcher at the New America Foundation in Washington and the author of a 2019 report titled Decoding The Wagner Group, told RFE/RL. \u201cAnd because of the culture of the military and the benefits that it offers, it just isn't incentive enough to get people to sign up voluntarily.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo these kinds of ghost forces or backfill forces, like we've seen with Wagner or Redut, are necessary because it essentially is a means of creating incentives outside the current system,\u201d Rondeaux added.\n\nNeither the Russian Defense Ministry nor Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to written inquiries about Redut.\n\nBut in the Redut system, all roads lead back to Russian military intelligence, the Schemes and Systema investigation found.\n\nBut in fact, the company Ivanov believed he had signed his contract with does not exist. It was a fictitious firm used as part of the Redut recruitment operation run by the GRU.\n\nTwo of Ivanov\u2019s fellow fighters told Schemes that the battalion was directly overseen by a GRU officer. Several battalion members said this handler used the call sign Amur and gave the orders to hold multiple local men in the Kharkiv region village of Borova captive in an earthen pit for interrogations \u2013 including at least one in which he wielded a knife and threatened to cut off a captive\u2019s fingers, according to a Ukrainian court verdict.\n\nThe Wolves battalion\u2019s connections to the GRU, the military intelligence directorate linked to the poisonings of Kremlin targets and sabotage operations in Europe, don\u2019t end there.\n\nIn both their trial testimony in Ukrainian court and in interviews with Schemes following their convictions on torture charges, two battalion members said they signed up with the GRU\u2019s 16th Special Forces Brigade.\n\nInternal records from the battalion also show that it was identified as part of the GRU.\n\nThe Wolves also use the training facility of the GRU\u2019s 16th Special Forces Brigade in the Tambov region, according to photographs obtained by reporters and interviews with fighters. The facility is where Wolves fighter Ivanov says **he stayed briefly in December 2021** \u2013 less than three months before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion \u2013 before being sent almost immediately to Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Luhansk region.\n\nIt was in Luhansk, Ivanov said, that he signed his contract with \u201csome kind of Redut LLC.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe arrived [December] 9, and on the 10th they handed us contracts and [said]: \u2018Read it, sign it,\u2019\u201d Ivanov told Schemes.\n\nThe legal mirage of this purported \u201cprivate military company\u201d has made it difficult for relatives of Redut mercenaries to track down those in charge to ask about unpaid wages, death benefits, fighters\u2019 whereabouts, leading to exasperated posts on Russian social-media networks.\n\nThere are no publicly available contact numbers for the various armed units operating under the Redut brand in Ukraine. In conversations with Systema, recruiters for these units said no such numbers exist and that families should just call them.\n\nThe widow of one Redut fighter told Systema she\u2019d been through \u201cseven circles of hell\u201d trying to collect back wages for her husband after he was killed in action.\n\nExclusive documents obtained by Systema highlight the murky, off-the-books nature of the Russian forces fighting in Ukraine under the Redut banner.\n\nAmong the cache of records left behind by the Wolves and later obtained by Schemes include mentions of battalion fighter Aleksandr Kopyltsov, a sniper using the call sign Nemo who was killed in battle in late March 2022 near Kyiv.\n\nKopyltsov\u2019s relatives subsequently attempted to receive death benefits from the Russian government but hit repeated roadblocks. They received at least five letters from the Russian Defense Ministry and military prosecutors saying there was no record that he had fought under Defense Ministry forces or \u201cvolunteer\u201d groups in Ukraine.\n\nWhile the Defense Ministry and military prosecutors may have had no record of Kopyltsov, the Kremlin apparently did: Putin posthumously granted him the Order of Courage in November 2022 \u2013 even before his family received multiple official letters saying the Defense Ministry was unaware of his combat in Ukraine.\n\nRussian military prosecutors ultimately informed Kopyltsov\u2019s family in July 2023 that it had already received compensation weeks after his death from \u201cthe private military company Redut,\u201d and that because he had not fought under the Defense Ministry or a \u201cvolunteer organization,\u201d there were no grounds to pursue action for the Russian government\u2019s failure to pay death benefits.\n\nThat reference is the only official mention by Russian authorities of a purported private military group called Redut that RFE/RL reporters were able to find.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how the Russian government would have learned of a payout to the family from Redut if it had no record of Kopyltsov as either a Russian soldier or volunteer.\n\nBut according to multiple Redut recruiters with whom Systema spoke, the paymasters of this purported private force are the Russian Defense Ministry itself \u2013 and its operators, the GRU.\n\n\"The majority of those fighting for what journalists call \u2018private military companies\u2019 are simply soldiers fighting under the control of the Defense Ministry,\" one source close to the GRU told Systema when asked about Redut.\n\nWhile Russian military prosecutors have called Redut a private military company, the recruiters who find people to fight under the Redut auspices confirm that no such company exists. In fact, there is no such legal category as \u201cprivate military company\u201d in Russia, although the appellation is regularly used for Wagner and the other mercenary groups supporting the Russian military.\n\nIn order to find out what ordinary Russians could learn about the ostensibly private Redut units fighting in Ukraine, Systema reporters contacted 11 different recruiters for Redut-linked battalions involved in the war. Five stated explicitly that the Russian Defense Ministry and the GRU are behind the operation of the Redut system.\n\n\u201cThe Redut system \u2013 it\u2019s, well, GRU,\u201d Natalya Lashkaryova, a senior member of a group called the Union of Donbas Volunteers, a semiofficial Russian organization recruiting fighters for the war in Ukraine, told a Systema reporter who called posing as a recruit.",

They pay us the money.\u201d\n\nThe amount of money recruiters promise potential recruits for enlisting is roughly the same: 110,000 rubles ($1,100) a month for time spent training and 220,000 rubles ($2,200) a month for time spent fighting in Ukraine. Th\u0435 salary for fighting is around three times the average monthly salary in Russia. Recruits are also promised large payments in the event of injury or death.\n\n\nAs of early 2023, fighters in some Redut units received money at the base of the 150th Motorized Infantry Division in the Rostov region, a source told Systema.\n\nFor potential mercenaries, a contract under a system like Redut offers better conditions than signing up with the military. The contracts last from three to six months, and if a fighter decides to go home early, the worst that usually happens is that they lose some of their pay and are blacklisted by their Redut unit. By contrast, soldiers in the military are required to serve until the end of what Russia calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine and, in the event they go AWOL, they could face years in prison.\n\nThe recruiter Djamal said fighters are signed up via the Redut system so they can avoid debt-collectors, legal garnishments, and alimony payments -- and so they have the option to quit before getting thrown into \u201ca long meat-grinder with no way out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether commanders have a formal accounting system for the money passing through this black-box operation.\n\nAfter the dramatic but short-lived mutiny by Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner forces in June, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered all mercenaries to sign contracts with his ministry by July 1. However, a recruiter with the call sign Kesha said that as of midsummer, **only commanders were being pressed to do so, while rank-and-file fighters continued to fight \u201cunofficially.\u201d**\n\nKesha is a recruiter for the Zubr (Bison) battalion, one of at least 20 armed mercenary groups that RFE/RL has identified as fighting in Ukraine as part of the Redut system.\n\nSome of the groups are based at the Trigulyai training and mustering center outside Tambov, which is the home of the GRU\u2019s 16th Brigade. These include one, called Alexander Nevsky, that calls itself a Russian Orthodox, patriotic formation, as well as several units named after animals \u2013 the Wolves, Tigers, and Lynx.\n\nOn December 9, 2021, Ivanov arrived at the gathering point for recruits near the Megamag shopping center in Rostov-on-Don. There, he says, he and around 80 others boarded minibuses and traveled to the Transpele base in the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk region. It was there that Ivanov signed his contract with the fictitious Redut company for a monthly salary of $2,000, plus combat bonuses and benefits for injury and death.\n\nWould-be Redut mercenaries can call or message a number listed on the ads, and the demands of the Redut recruiters on the other end vary depending on which formation is involved. A recruiter from a formation called the Veterans only asks a recruit\u2019s age and immediately relays the address of the mustering point.\n\nDuring a subsequent Kafkaesque quest to obtain death benefits from the Russian government, Kopyltsov's relatives received at least five letters from the Russian Defense Ministry and military prosecutors saying there was no record that he had fought in Ukraine under the auspices of the Defense Ministry or \"volunteer\" groups. Curiously, four of these letters were dated after he was posthumously granted the Order of Courage, a state award, by Putin in November 2022.\n\nIt is the only official mention by Russian authorities of a supposed private military group called Redut that RFE/RL was able to find. It's unclear precisely how the Russian government learned of a payout from Redut if it had no record of Kopyltsov as either a Russian soldier or volunteer.\n\nThe investigation by Schemes and Systema also found that Redut has something akin to political handlers among influential figures in Russian military intelligence.\n\n\nThe soccer-hooligan unit known as Espanola has its mustering base in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, in the Donetsk region. The Veterans, meanwhile, gather at a village in Russia\u2019s western Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine. Units associated with the Union of Donbas Volunteers, including one called the St. George Brigade, are based in Rostov-on-Don and muster at a three-star hotel called Timosha on the left bank of the Don River.\n\nAfter the recruits sign their contracts, the newly minted mercenaries are assigned to a military unit \u2013 often only on paper.\n\n\u201cWe have a \u2018virtual\u2019 unit,\u201d Gonyets, who recruits for the Tigers formation, told Systema. \u201cIf you end up in a hospital, you mention the number of your unit. When you arrive, they tell you what number to give in case something happens.\u201d\n\nWhen a mercenary\u2019s six-month contract expires, he faces the choice of signing another Redut agreement or returning to civilian life. For those who return to Russia, it can be difficult to prove that they fought in Ukraine at all.\n\nThe pro-Kremlin Telegram channel WarGonzo posted a video of the proceedings in which representatives of other mercenary companies could be seen. Those present included Aleksandr Borodai, a Russian lawmaker and former leader of Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine who heads the group, as well as Russian tycoon Konstantin Malofeyev and Aleksei Zhuravlyov, deputy chairman of the Defense Committee in the State Duma, Russia\u2019s lower chamber of parliament.\n\nSeveral recruiters contacted by Systema said that Redut -- not the Union of Donbas Volunteers -- served as the nucleus of the Russian Volunteer Corps. In fact, the Union of Donbas Volunteers itself is part of the Redut network. RFE/RL has established that fighters with the St. George Brigade sign contracts with Redut.\n\nThe document Systema obtained is signed by Colonel A. Kondratyev, who is identified as the \u201ccommander of the combat unit of the Volunteer Corps.\u201d The signature belongs to Aleksei Kondratyev, a retired GRU colonel and a former mayor of the city of Tambov, which he also represented in the Russian parliament. The signature matches Kondratyev\u2019s signatures found on publicly available parliamentary documents.\n\nKondratyev was one of at least three senior figures linked to the Russian Defense Ministry who were present at the February 2023 gathering of the Union of Donbas Volunteers.\n\nThe other two were Colonel Sergei Drozdov, a senior recruitment official with the General Staff of the Russian military, and Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseyev, deputy head of the GRU.",

Calling it jaw-dropping doesn't do it justice, plus he has literary skills (a lot of nuance is missed by the machine translator).\n\n[https://t](https://t). me/thulzet\n\nJust an excerpt (after failing to advance and hiding in a forest their group of five penal soldiers try to weasel their way out of the situation. They talk to a regular officer callsign \"Bersh\").\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\- \\[Bersh speaking on radio in front of the group\\] Ginger, this is Bersh. There are five from Bodry's company here. They ran back \\[they \"five-hundredth\" - failed to carry out orders\\].\n\n\\- I will take them for myself. Write down the call signs and give them to Bodry.\n\n\"Azart\" beeped and the connection stopped.\n\nBersh looked at us affectionately and nodded his head in a friendly manner.\n\nWe've all heard about Bersh.\n\nBersh was a famous person. Just as they scare children with old jokes, so they scared storms Z in our regiment with Bersh.\n\nThey send him to re-educate bad guys. He re-educates them, driving them into assaults on machine gun emplacements, and if he had his own cemetery, it would occupy a football field.\n\nBersh is a young, handsome guy with the eyes of a butcher who loves his profession.\n\nHe was known for never hiding his brutal truth from anyone; he said openly what others thought, but had to veil it with some kind of diplomatic sophistry.\n\nHe dealt exclusively with concentrated, complete scum, which showed itself in all its glory here, in the SVO area. He did not know other Zetas \\[\"normal\" Zs\\] because he had no dealings with them.\n\nBersh had his own main unit. And the \u201cdogs of war\u201d standing behind him are his backbone of conventional IT specialists Zhen from Volgograd, married with two children.\n\nBersh\u2019s task was to ensure that the operations entrusted to him were carried out perfectly, while the number of Zhenas, packaged in black plastic bags, should be close to zero.\n\nAnd he had no doubt that this result could be derived only by having a resource of cheap meat, which is of absolutely no value.\n\nSomeone has to die, and if possible, it should not be the IT specialist Zhenya from Volgograd, who is married and has two children.\n\nFor Bersch, in this regard, everything was simple.\n\nThis was his philosophy, his truth, and he implemented it without the slightest hesitation or reflection.\n\nNow his unit was solving problems and inevitably suffering losses.
