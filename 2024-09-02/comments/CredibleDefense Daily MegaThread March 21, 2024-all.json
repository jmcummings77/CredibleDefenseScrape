        "body": "An other report on the systemic issues facing Ukraine.  This time with mobilization.  Generally bad news in almost all respects.  If you're interested in a timeline for any new mobilization law you will be disappointed...*None of the lawmakers Kyiv Post interviewed was willing to offer a prediction about how long it would take for a finalized version of the draft law to be considered by the full parliament.*\n\n[What\u2019s up With Mobilization in Ukraine? | Kyiv Post | March 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/29886)\n\n*Ukraine needs more soldiers, but Russian propaganda, high casualties, and systemic issues stoke fears about signing up, while bad statistics and political reluctance are only exacerbating the problem.*\n\n*While it\u2019s generally agreed that something has to be done to replace fallen soldiers and to give those who've been fighting since the beginning of Russia\u2019s Feb. 24, 2022 invasion a chance to rest, Kyiv is facing an uphill battle as it navigates the fraught issue of updating its conscription law.*\n\n*Matters have not been helped by scandals coming to light revealing that some mobilization centers have been forcibly taking Ukrainian men off the streets and driving them away.*\n\n*Although nearly a million people joined the military \u2013 mostly as volunteers \u2013 in the first months of the full-scale invasion, according to various sources, tens of thousands are believed to have died and an even greater number have been wounded.*\n\n*What is quite astonishing, though, is that while Ukraine fights for its very survival as an independent nation, the average age of its fighters today is 43, and so far those under 27 have been exempted from conscription.*\n\n*\u201cI have a lot of men 40-plus and also older in my unit \u2013 almost half of all the personnel. After more than a year in the trenches, many of us are dealing with health problems, like back pain and chronic health issues are becoming more serious. Life in the trenches isn\u2019t as easy for us as it is for younger people. Some have problems with blood pressure or kidney problems. Some require regular hospital visits,\u201d Vadym, a serviceman from one of the Territorial Defense units, told Kyiv Post.*\n\n*But replacing those who\u2019ve been serving all this time is proving to be difficult. Social networks have become filled with shocking videos of men being impressed into service by those working at Ukraine\u2019s Territorial Recruitment Centers (TRCs).*\n\n*One video, posted on Instagram Sunday, March 17, shows a man in Lviv being grabbed by TRC servicemen on the street and thrown into a van, \u201clike a criminal,\u201d a woman, claiming to be his wife, says under the video\u2019s description.*\n\n*Hromadske reported that on Wednesday, March 20, the man in the video, Kyrylo Taran, did not show up for his summons and is now facing charges. Not showing up for a summons can result in three to five years imprisonment.*\n\n*A second video from Lviv posted on Telegram at the end of November, shows a woman struggling against TRC servicemen as they grab a man and force him into an SUV \u2013 afterward, smashing her phone.*\n\n*And a video posted on Instagram on March 15, allegedly shows a young man, Yevhen, from the Zakarpattia region, who appears to have been beaten.*\n\n*The person who posted the video, identifying herself as Anna, says that her boyfriend had been taken out of the hotel where he was staying. She says he was then beaten, mocked, and had his personal belongings stolen by the local Khust TRC. The young man was driven to attempt suicide out of desperation, she said.*\n\n*In a comment to the Ukrainian news outlet Suspilno, the Zakarpattian TRC, which is responsible for Khust TRC personnel, said that on March 13, Yevhen had been caught by border guards while attempting to cross Ukraine\u2019s border illegally. They reported that the young man had been found in the bathroom with cuts on his wrists and was taken to the hospital.*\n\n*Yulia Shevchenko, a spokeswoman for the Western region\u2019s special prosecutor\u2019s office told Suspilno that two criminal proceedings have been opened.*\n\n*But while examples of abuse of power exist, they are the exceptions in a sea of cases where those summoned to service report for duty and where the TRC acts professionally, Oleksiy Bezhevets, Ministry of Defense representative told Kyiv Post.*\n\n*Another problem with Ukraine\u2019s mobilization plans is that population statistics are not up to date. \u201cFor example, in the western regions, particularly, in Zakarpattia Oblast, there are no longer 1,200,000 people, as is still written in statistics,\u201d Fedir Shandor, a professor of history and sociology at Uzhhorod University, who volunteered to fight for Ukraine in the spring of 2022, told Kyiv Post.*\n\n*\u201cMany people are employed abroad and haven\u2019t changed their registration, so formally, they are still here. For example, the statistics may say there are 200 people in a village, but actually there may be only 30 to 50. We were doing this research before the full-scale invasion. But the thing is that the plans of the TRC are based on old demographic statistics. It is clear that it is difficult to complete their task with such data.\u201d*\n\n*Another issue may be the so-called \u201cdead souls\u201d problem \u2013 when TRC recruiters attempt to draft someone who might have even been dead for years.*\n\n*Those wishing to fight for Ukraine \u2013 who are undeterred by Russian propaganda, the fear of being killed, or the unfortunate condition of being long dead \u2013 are wrestling with some other concrete issues.*\n\n*Andrii Kuzhel, a volunteer and serviceman since 2014, the head of the Chernihiv district military administration during the siege of Chernihiv in 2022, said that those who would like to join the army have questions that authorities haven\u2019t answered.*\n\n*\u201cMany people complain that training is awful in training centers, not as they expected, and that some commanders behave with soldiers in the [authoritarian] Soviet style. Such stories can demotivate others\u2026 And what is more important for people is to know when they will be able to return home. This is important. They need to know for how long they will be removed from the household and life. Will they return in a year? Or two? Or three? Or never? There are no answers to this today,\u201d Kuzhel said.*\n\n*The new mobilization draft law is intended to address these problems. It passed its first reading on Feb. 12, which allowed amendments to be made to it. After the amendments are considered, it gets voted on a second time and then becomes a law or not.*\n\n*However, some 4,300 amendments, most of them proposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s Servant of the People party, have been proposed and are holding up the process.*\n\n*As is known, politicians will swamp an unpopular draft law with amendments when they wish to delay its passage. Some, particularly representatives of opposition parties, say that\u2019s what is happening now with the mobilization draft law.*\n\n*So far, only about 1,505 of the draft law\u2019s amendments have been considered and more and more questions are being raised at home and abroad about the reasons for the procrastination.*\n\n*There have been days when the parliamentary committee in charge of considering the mobilization draft law considered just one amendment per day. Yet, as witnessed at the last meeting of the committee 660 amendments were considered at once, European Solidarity party member Iryna Friz confirmed.*\n\n*None of the lawmakers Kyiv Post interviewed was willing to offer a prediction about how long it would take for a finalized version of the draft law to be considered by the full parliament.*\n\n*Obviously, the longer the process is drawn out, some of its more controversial aspects are likely to become even more contested and to impact on the ratings of the Zelensky administration in opinion polls.*\n\n*The proposed draft law lowers the conscription age from 27 to 25 and adds new penalties for those found to be draft dodging \u2013 including a significant increase in fines. It proposes to define more clearly who can be exempted from mobilization and who is responsible for carrying out the mobilization in conjunction with the TRCs \u2013 be it at the level of towns or regions.*\n\n*Lawmakers also propose to resolve the problem of there being no limit on the amount of time a conscripted soldier serves. The consensus is that those who\u2019ve served 36 months continuously \u2013 with a year to a year-and-a-half on the front line \u2013 will be demobilized and returned home.*\n\n*However, according to Dykyi, even the proposed law is too \u201csoft.\u201d He told Kyiv Post that it is not tough enough on draft dodgers, as many of the proposed penalties for draft dodgers have been removed from the original version.*\n\n*\u201cWe have two problems to solve \u2013 service term limits and punishment for evasion. I see good news on the first, but no progress on the second issue,\u201d Dykyi said.*\n\n*So right now, as the Ukrainian leadership pleads with its Western supporters to speed up the supply of weapons and ammunition, it has laid itself open to charges that it is not showing sufficient political will at home to ensure that it has enough troops at the front. That it is not managing the vital but sensitive issue of mobilization as well it should.*",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An other report on the systemic issues facing Ukraine.  This time with mobilization.  Generally bad news in almost all respects.  If you&#39;re interested in a timeline for any new mobilization law you will be disappointed...<em>None of the lawmakers Kyiv Post interviewed was willing to offer a prediction about how long it would take for a finalized version of the draft law to be considered by the full parliament.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/29886\">What\u2019s up With Mobilization in Ukraine? | Kyiv Post | March 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukraine needs more soldiers, but Russian propaganda, high casualties, and systemic issues stoke fears about signing up, while bad statistics and political reluctance are only exacerbating the problem.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>While it\u2019s generally agreed that something has to be done to replace fallen soldiers and to give those who&#39;ve been fighting since the beginning of Russia\u2019s Feb. 24, 2022 invasion a chance to rest, Kyiv is facing an uphill battle as it navigates the fraught issue of updating its conscription law.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Matters have not been helped by scandals coming to light revealing that some mobilization centers have been forcibly taking Ukrainian men off the streets and driving them away.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Although nearly a million people joined the military \u2013 mostly as volunteers \u2013 in the first months of the full-scale invasion, according to various sources, tens of thousands are believed to have died and an even greater number have been wounded.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>What is quite astonishing, though, is that while Ukraine fights for its very survival as an independent nation, the average age of its fighters today is 43, and so far those under 27 have been exempted from conscription.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cI have a lot of men 40-plus and also older in my unit \u2013 almost half of all the personnel. After more than a year in the trenches, many of us are dealing with health problems, like back pain and chronic health issues are becoming more serious. Life in the trenches isn\u2019t as easy for us as it is for younger people. Some have problems with blood pressure or kidney problems. Some require regular hospital visits,\u201d Vadym, a serviceman from one of the Territorial Defense units, told Kyiv Post.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>But replacing those who\u2019ve been serving all this time is proving to be difficult. Social networks have become filled with shocking videos of men being impressed into service by those working at Ukraine\u2019s Territorial Recruitment Centers (TRCs).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>One video, posted on Instagram Sunday, March 17, shows a man in Lviv being grabbed by TRC servicemen on the street and thrown into a van, \u201clike a criminal,\u201d a woman, claiming to be his wife, says under the video\u2019s description.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Hromadske reported that on Wednesday, March 20, the man in the video, Kyrylo Taran, did not show up for his summons and is now facing charges. Not showing up for a summons can result in three to five years imprisonment.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A second video from Lviv posted on Telegram at the end of November, shows a woman struggling against TRC servicemen as they grab a man and force him into an SUV \u2013 afterward, smashing her phone.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>And a video posted on Instagram on March 15, allegedly shows a young man, Yevhen, from the Zakarpattia region, who appears to have been beaten.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The person who posted the video, identifying herself as Anna, says that her boyfriend had been taken out of the hotel where he was staying. She says he was then beaten, mocked, and had his personal belongings stolen by the local Khust TRC.

Once the Russians are defeated strategically in 2023, placed in a situation where they will probably need to sue for peace in 2024, why do they need to work on conscription problems? After all, Robotyne in a day, Tokmak by Day 3, and it'll only get easier after that. \n\nThen reality smacked them in the face. They took ridiculously high and unplanned casualties all early winter of 2023, between Bakhmut especially and the overall Winter offensive, needing to feed those meatgrinders while also building 18 new brigades in half a year. Then the offensive and it stalled immediately, turning into a slog fight where extremely costly dismounted attacks were performed aggressively for five months, when they probably didn't even plan ahead of time for 1/5 of what they'd take.\n\nOn Mike Kofman's and Rob Lee's last Russia Contingency podcast together they were lamenting that UAF brigades were still conducting costly assaults into November even though further operational or strategic success at that point was impossible. Despite their known casualties. Despite already having to cannibalize their support units for assault infantry due to the breakdown in the replacement system. AND THEY WERE STILL ORDERING ATTACKS.\n\nWhen Russia does that, it's both reassuring because of the cost, it's kinda funny because it's pathetic, and it's kinda scary because they'll take the casualties willingly.

Meanwhile, they're still seriously talking about discharging troops, which is insane because that'll mean needing to replace even more, plus the added turbulence of losing the most experienced troops who are typically the glue in their units holding everything together.\n\nI've said it a hundred times before about this war, it's as true now as ever before in history: Actions have consequences.",

Also, the study specifically mentions passenger vehicle (PV), not just cars so rickshaws are included.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/data/data-e-rickshaws-to-two-wheelers-the-shift-in-the-share-of-electric-vehicles/article67090337.ece/amp/\">In this article</a>, it even says the share of electric <em>vehicles</em> hasn\u2019t even passed 1% yet in India.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-022-00122-0#:%7E:text=There%20are%20about%208%20million,challenges%20associated%20with%20electric%20vehicles\">Considering there are only about 8M rickshaws in India</a>, I highly doubt this makes up the bulk of their transport network. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/industry-there-are-over-30-million-cars-on-indian-roads-3273589/lite/\">there are about 30M cars running on Indian roads</a>.

        "body": "An update on the Krynky bridgehead and apparently a new Antonovsky bridgehead. It mentions vehicles across the river but not what type.  Both sides remain committed with drones playing an ever increasing roll.  \n\n[Embattled Marines on Dnipro Bridgehead Gain New Foothold Despite Swarms of Russian Drones | Kyiv Post | March 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/29829)\n\n*Swarms of Russian drones have forced Ukrainian Marines dug in on the south bank of the Dnipro River to shelter underground to escape them. But they are still holding their positions and according to some recent reports may have even expanded the bridgehead into Kremlin-controlled territory.*\n\n*Between 60 and 100 Ukrainian Marines living in cellars and basements in the ruined village of Krynky face almost continuous assault from Russian attack drones as long as the sun is up. When night falls, they patrol the two to three kilometers of no man\u2019s land that links their bridgehead to the river when small boats bring up supplies and reinforcements as detailed in unofficial reports from the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades on Tuesday and Wednesday.*\n\n*Ukrainian military spokesman Serhiy Beskrestnov spoke about the Russian drone presence in the Krynky sector during the March 16, Mi-Ukraiina national television broadcast.*\n\n*\u201cIn general, our entire Marine force sits underground 24/7, because if a Marine infantryman appears on the surface, a Russian robot aircraft attacks him.\u201d*\n\n*Aleks, a Ukrainian lieutenant serving with the Marines in the same Kryky sector wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday: \u201cTransport there is a big part of our losses. There is the problem of soldiers being killed and wounded on the left bank (and bringing them back). The wounded get medical assistance, but due to the situation\u2026 the guys can wait for evacuation for several days or weeks to get to the rear. Unfortunately, not all of them survive. The evacuation of the dead is very problematic.\u201d*\n\n*Russian sources said that Moscow\u2019s troops, likewise, face masses of Ukrainian kamikaze drone and artillery strikes whenever they leave cover to resupply the forces trying to destroy Kyiv\u2019s bridgehead. The low ground and thick woods around the Marines\u2019 positions force combat vehicles to stay on roads \u2013 making them potentially easy targets for air attack and ambushes.*\n\n*Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported in an official meeting with President Vladimir Putin in mid-October that the Ukrainian bridgehead established near the city of Kherson had been finally wiped out. Combat videos from both Russian and Ukrainian sources have been contradicting that narrative for weeks.*\n\n*Recent images made public by Robert Brovdi, a senior commander of Ukrainian drone reconnaissance and strike teams operating in the Krynky sector, confirmed Ukrainian troops were still holding the bridgehead despite intense Russian drone activity.*\n\n*Russian operators have reportedly begun use of a new, winged FPV drone with an extended range and enhanced payload against the Marine positions. In a typical day of combat, Kremlin troops launch up to 80 FPV drones against Krynky, Brovdi said in a March 18 situation update.*\n\n*Geolocated combat video of Russian drones reviewed by Kyiv Post showed the successful Ukrainian intercept and shoot-down of a Russian aircraft in air space above Dnipro River wetlands.*\n\n*Ukrainian forces can jam and, in some cases, take over control of the Russian attack drones and fly them back to hit enemy positions, Brovdi said.*\n\n*Ukrainian operators knocked out ten Russian winged drones in a single day of combat and have put more than 2,900 Russian drones out of action since October. About 77 percent of Russian drones launched towards Ukrainian positions are destroyed or jammed, which has allowed the continued supply of the Krynky bridgehead, he said.*\n\n*Kyiv Post could not confirm Brovdi\u2019s claims about Russian drone losses independently. Both Russian and Ukrainian sources report small boats continue to deliver ammunition and food to positions around Krynky, but with losses.*\n\n*Multiple Russian sources on Wednesday indicated that Ukrainian troops had opened another cross-river bridgehead to the west of Krynky, close to the remains of the massive Antonovsky bridge by the Dnipro River city of Kherson.*\n\n*Ukrainian forces using US-made precision-guided missiles badly damaged the critical supply artery across the bridge in September 2022, and Russian engineers blew up two sections of the bridge following the October retreat to the south bank of the river Dnipro, Ukraine\u2019s largest waterway.*\n\n*Small groups of Ukrainian infantry recently crossed the Dnipro River and are digging in on the south bank, using the reinforced concrete roadwork and columns of the bridge as cover, multiple Russian milblogger reports have claimed. Some reports said the Ukrainian force numbered 20-30 men and two to three vehicles.*\n\n*The popular Russian Telegram poster Romanov Lite in a Tuesday message to his 140,000-plus followers, posted a drone video with locations around the bridge where Ukrainian troops had purportedly taken up defensive positions and showing images of a ruined hotel allegedly being used by the Ukrainians as strong point.*\n\n*Other Russian milbloggers reported the Ukrainian presence in the area, but Kremlin sources did not. Moscow-appointed governor Vladimir Saldo partially acknowledged the new Ukrainian enclave on March 5 but called it a \u201craid.\u201d*",

But they are still holding their positions and according to some recent reports may have even expanded the bridgehead into Kremlin-controlled territory.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Between 60 and 100 Ukrainian Marines living in cellars and basements in the ruined village of Krynky face almost continuous assault from Russian attack drones as long as the sun is up. When night falls, they patrol the two to three kilometers of no man\u2019s land that links their bridgehead to the river when small boats bring up supplies and reinforcements as detailed in unofficial reports from the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades on Tuesday and Wednesday.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukrainian military spokesman Serhiy Beskrestnov spoke about the Russian drone presence in the Krynky sector during the March 16, Mi-Ukraiina national television broadcast.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cIn general, our entire Marine force sits underground 24/7, because if a Marine infantryman appears on the surface, a Russian robot aircraft attacks him.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Aleks, a Ukrainian lieutenant serving with the Marines in the same Kryky sector wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday: \u201cTransport there is a big part of our losses. There is the problem of soldiers being killed and wounded on the left bank (and bringing them back). The wounded get medical assistance, but due to the situation\u2026 the guys can wait for evacuation for several days or weeks to get to the rear. Unfortunately, not all of them survive. The evacuation of the dead is very problematic.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Russian sources said that Moscow\u2019s troops, likewise, face masses of Ukrainian kamikaze drone and artillery strikes whenever they leave cover to resupply the forces trying to destroy Kyiv\u2019s bridgehead. The low ground and thick woods around the Marines\u2019 positions force combat vehicles to stay on roads \u2013 making them potentially easy targets for air attack and ambushes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported in an official meeting with President Vladimir Putin in mid-October that the Ukrainian bridgehead established near the city of Kherson had been finally wiped out. Combat videos from both Russian and Ukrainian sources have been contradicting that narrative for weeks.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Recent images made public by Robert Brovdi, a senior commander of Ukrainian drone reconnaissance and strike teams operating in the Krynky sector, confirmed Ukrainian troops were still holding the bridgehead despite intense Russian drone activity.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Russian operators have reportedly begun use of a new, winged FPV drone with an extended range and enhanced payload against the Marine positions. In a typical day of combat, Kremlin troops launch up to 80 FPV drones against Krynky, Brovdi said in a March 18 situation update.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Geolocated combat video of Russian drones reviewed by Kyiv Post showed the successful Ukrainian intercept and shoot-down of a Russian aircraft in air space above Dnipro River wetlands.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukrainian forces can jam and, in some cases, take over control of the Russian attack drones and fly them back to hit enemy positions, Brovdi said.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukrainian operators knocked out ten Russian winged drones in a single day of combat and have put more than 2,900 Russian drones out of action since October. About 77 percent of Russian drones launched towards Ukrainian positions are destroyed or jammed, which has allowed the continued supply of the Krynky bridgehead, he said.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Kyiv Post could not confirm Brovdi\u2019s claims about Russian drone losses independently. Both Russian and Ukrainian sources report small boats continue to deliver ammunition and food to positions around Krynky, but with losses.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Multiple Russian sources on Wednesday indicated that Ukrainian troops had opened another cross-river bridgehead to the west of Krynky, close to the remains of the massive Antonovsky bridge by the Dnipro River city of Kherson.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukrainian forces using US-made precision-guided missiles badly damaged the critical supply artery across the bridge in September 2022, and Russian engineers blew up two sections of the bridge following the October retreat to the south bank of the river Dnipro, Ukraine\u2019s largest waterway.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Small groups of Ukrainian infantry recently crossed the Dnipro River and are digging in on the south bank, using the reinforced concrete roadwork and columns of the bridge as cover, multiple Russian milblogger reports have claimed. Some reports said the Ukrainian force numbered 20-30 men and two to three vehicles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The popular Russian Telegram poster Romanov Lite in a Tuesday message to his 140,000-plus followers, posted a drone video with locations around the bridge where Ukrainian troops had purportedly taken up defensive positions and showing images of a ruined hotel allegedly being used by the Ukrainians as strong point.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Other Russian milbloggers reported the Ukrainian presence in the area, but Kremlin sources did not. Moscow-appointed governor Vladimir Saldo partially acknowledged the new Ukrainian enclave on March 5 but called it a \u201craid.\u201d</em></p>\n</div>",

The local operational strategic grouping commander (Teplinsky) was going to pull back, give that area to the Ukrainians, but stop them from moving outwards. \n\nWhy? Because the UAF cross river operation is just a bait to draw the Russians to counterattack through highly channelized routes leading to the river. It's basically a 21st century Verdun, where UAF Marines take ground that the Russians will want back, but will be forced to cross the heavily overwatched ground covered by drone directed Recon Fires Complex located on the elevated west bank who can see and engage every route leading to Krynky for like a dozen kilometers from the river, forcing the Russians to brave the gauntlet just to get to the attack positions. The closer they are to the river, the more dangerous it is for the Russians.\n\nWhy did the Ukrainians think the Russians would take the bait? Because Putin and Gerasimov need to save face, leading to aggressive counterattack to drive the UAF back across the Dnieper.\n\nBut is that militarily necessary? Ukraine absolutely doesn't have the ability to move an operational level force across that river and secure a legitimate lodgement. And Russian Recon Fires Complex capabilities is at least equal to Ukraine's, they can sit back and attrit the east bank lodgement area until they are forced to retreat or they eat the manpower losses that everyone and their brother knows they can't sustain. And the Ukrainians can't break out because then they need to cross the heavily overwatched channelized terrain east of the river. \n\nAnd yet the original Dnieper Russian commander was fired in Oct for allowing the initial UAF raids to succeed despite his front being the ultimate operational backwater in terms of support. And then his replacement (one of the most competent of all Russian generals) had his militarily correct order to retreat revoked, and was forced to go on the counterattack for five months now, getting very seriously attrited in the process. And still haven't retaken Krynky. \n\nI can't believe the Russians keep falling for this. I've been saying for years now how easy it would be to operationally \"play\" the Russians, Putin and his top brass are as blatantly predictable as Zelensky and the UAF top brass. If the UAF General Staff actually planned with cunning they could routinely bait the Russians to react and respond in a way that maximizes Russian losses, minimizing Ukrainian, while Ukraine keeps the initiative without needing to go on the strategic offensive.\n\nIf the UAF used actual volunteers to hold the eastern bank as bait and not using conscripts fighting involuntarily, Krynky would have been a near perfect campaign to serve as a template for an Active Defense strategy actually based on attrition. Unfortunately, using the Marines ruthlessly as cannon fodder when they can't be trusted not to air their grievances in social media or to the press, during a horrific ongoing mobilization crisis, has spoiled this campaign. \n\nService in the Forlorn Hope is supposed to be voluntary.",

Shoigu has periodically announced these types of changes in peacetime and then not staffed them (like in 2016). This is wartime, so it\u2019s different. Keep an eye on it, but don\u2019t take it at face value. A few thoughts:\n\n>In 2016, Shoigu said 10 new divisions would be stood up, mostly IVO Ukraine. We tracked them. They were based on existing brigades, not new units. They didn\u2019t add overall billets to the army (red flag). They were undermanned until fall 2021 when some received BARS personnel.\n\n>Shoigu said last year they would create a combined arms army for Ukraine, and they did that. But then they basically lost that unit\u2019s equivalent equipment at Avdiivka over five months.\n\n>I believe they will try to make these units - yet I question their ability to give them equipment and man them in the next few years, due to past precedent**. Regenerating from scratch is well over 100K soldiers. Then they have to be equipped, when equipment goes to Ukraine.\n\n>***The low likelihood /high impact scenario is that they build out these units with another large mobilization in mind in 2025ish. That will not be a quiet process and right now it\u2019s not happening. it\u2019s worth checking assumptions and indicators periodically.\n\n>There is a difference between them saying they will create combined arms armies, divisions, brigades and increasing billets, and what doing what it will require:  new or refurbished bases, with equipment sets; a bigger/extended draft, flawless postwar retention and recruiting. \n\n>Russia is planning on increasing the size of its force. They are moving in this direction.  Skepticism of Russian claims\u2014 what are the real timelines, and identifying evidence suggesting they are executing this \u2014 would be wise to keep on board.",

Keep an eye on it, but don\u2019t take it at face value. A few thoughts:</p>\n\n<p>In 2016, Shoigu said 10 new divisions would be stood up, mostly IVO Ukraine. We tracked them. They were based on existing brigades, not new units. They didn\u2019t add overall billets to the army (red flag). They were undermanned until fall 2021 when some received BARS personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Shoigu said last year they would create a combined arms army for Ukraine, and they did that. But then they basically lost that unit\u2019s equivalent equipment at Avdiivka over five months.</p>\n\n<p>I believe they will try to make these units - yet I question their ability to give them equipment and man them in the next few years, due to past precedent**. Regenerating from scratch is well over 100K soldiers. Then they have to be equipped, when equipment goes to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>***The low likelihood /high impact scenario is that they build out these units with another large mobilization in mind in 2025ish. That will not be a quiet process and right now it\u2019s not happening. it\u2019s worth checking assumptions and indicators periodically.</p>\n\n<p>There is a difference between them saying they will create combined arms armies, divisions, brigades and increasing billets, and what doing what it will require:  new or refurbished bases, with equipment sets; a bigger/extended draft, flawless postwar retention and recruiting. </p>\n\n<p>Russia is planning on increasing the size of its force. They are moving in this direction.  Skepticism of Russian claims\u2014 what are the real timelines, and identifying evidence suggesting they are executing this \u2014 would be wise to keep on board.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Statista drew its data from the World Bank, which uses calculations done by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which relies on national offices and their definition of \"urban\" to calculate urbanization ratios. [The definitions used by each nation have been collated in this document from the UN.](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/defintion_of%20urban.pdf) Here is Russias:\n\n>Cities and urban-type localities, officially designated as such, usually according to the criteria of number of inhabitants and predominance of agricultural, or number of non-agricultural workers and their families. \n\nAs you can see, this definition specifically excludes areas where agriculture is the predominant industry; in other words the exact places that would be least sensitive to rising food and fuel prices.\n\nI could corroborate this by doing the math adding up the top 20 cities to get an absolute minimum urbanization ratio, but honestly I don't have the time. Suffice it to point out that Moscow alone represents about 10% of the total Russian population, and St. Peterburg 5%. Those are not small numbers of people.\n\nEdit: Oh look, Wikipedias done the math for me already: \n\n>Note that the sixteen largest cities have a total population of 35,509,177, or roughly 24.1% of the country's total population.\n\nEdit 2: Okay, summing the entire Wikipedia table for cities with populations over 50,0000, we get 86.9M people.

Statista drew its data from the World Bank, which uses calculations done by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which relies on national offices and their definition of &quot;urban&quot; to calculate urbanization ratios. <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/defintion_of%20urban.pdf\">The definitions used by each nation have been collated in this document from the UN.</a> Here is Russias:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cities and urban-type localities, officially designated as such, usually according to the criteria of number of inhabitants and predominance of agricultural, or number of non-agricultural workers and their families. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, this definition specifically excludes areas where agriculture is the predominant industry; in other words the exact places that would be least sensitive to rising food and fuel prices.</p>\n\n<p>I could corroborate this by doing the math adding up the top 20 cities to get an absolute minimum urbanization ratio, but honestly I don&#39;t have the time. Suffice it to point out that Moscow alone represents about 10% of the total Russian population, and St. Peterburg 5%. Those are not small numbers of people.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Oh look, Wikipedias done the math for me already: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that the sixteen largest cities have a total population of 35,509,177, or roughly 24.1% of the country&#39;s total population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Okay, summing the entire Wikipedia table for cities with populations over 50,0000, we get 86.9M people. So Russia&#39;s urbanization ratio is at minimum 60%, and that&#39;s a gross underestimate as it misses a huge number of smaller cities that would still unquestionably be urban.</p>\n</div>",

IDK what future air war will look like, if I did I would be writing for War on the Rocks I guess. But I know its not that. \n\nFirst and foremost I like the idea that the attack on Jordan really blew up what they call 70 years of air dominance. Really? The attack that killed three SOF operators? Did the drone sneak by an F-22 screen of this vitally important base, the locus of American forces in the Middle East? Were F-15s vectored to intercept, but too late! No. Its taking a single tragedy and spinning it into the answer which the authors have already reached. \n\nBeyond this, there is no engagement with either the air war in Ukraine OR the anti-drone war. I think a lot of people here have been very concerned, rightly, about the increase in Russian glide bomb attacks. They seem to have helped Russia sustain offensives that would not have come off a year ago. How are they dropped again? And where has Ukraine's response been? What about all those Soviet-era attacker aircraft they have here? Have drones shot them down? No, its manned aircraft on both sides fighting a very active air war. And of course, Ukraine's *anti-*drone campaign has been effective. Maybe it could improve sure, but lets just pause to reflect on how well they done and how much they've improved. Manned aircraft are vital in that as a flexible line of defense protecting cities. \n\nDrones are going to be a *part* of air warfare going forward, though I also think its incorrect to assume that the successful drones today are going to be the drones of the future. Weve seen that EW is highly effective against many civilian type drones, meaning we will need some good old fashioned MIC bloat to get multimillion unjammable drones, and even then most drones are highly susceptible to ground fire and interception. If the Ukrainian army deployed AD in the density of the armies of WWII, would drones be such an issue? If no, does that suggest that modern drones are finding a niche in an area of underinvestment, and that proper investment will close that niche? Anyway this is not to say that drones are going away, but that their role is going to be accommodated into a large scheme of air warfare which is new, but not a fundamental revolution from what we see today. \n\nAnd so what is going to happen to the USAF in a hypothetical war with China if it abandons the F-35, as is being proposed here. What is going to stop Chinese BMs from hitting Taiwan and US bases around the region? Anti-BM drones? We have that, its called THAAD, and its very expensive. What will shoot down Chinese planes dropping bombs on US forces? We have that, its Patriot, and its also very expensive. Also GBAD is only one half the puzzle. \n\nLike I genuinely wonder why an LTG of the USAF would write something so critical of his service, if we take his argument any further than he already does its basically calling for the dismantling of the USAF and investment in GBAD which has been successful in anti-drone work in Ukraine. Like does this guy own stock in a drone manufacturer? Is he heading up a project for Raytheon selling drones to the Army? I dont get it.

If you remove or scale these requirements back you remove a huge amount of complexity and that is the biggest driver in cost.

The main points were relatively simple:\n\n\\- It has always been very difficult to break cleanly through a defence properly constructed: deeply layered, fronted with mines, backed by reserves. Forces with air superiority or even air supremacy and overwhelming artillery superior have repeatedly failed to do so in the past 100 years of military experience. \n\n\\- There is simply no military victory solution for this war. Ukraine can't advance to Moscow. Even if Ukraine takes back all of its territories up to the 1991 borders, it's not like Putin will go \"ooopps, my bad, sorry guys\". He will be couped and out of office. He can stop that outcome by simply saying \"OK, we need to get serious because we are fighting the entire west now\". Missile strikes can still be launched at Ukraine's infrastructure and cities. On the other hand, the Russians can destroy the Ukrainian army and go all the way to the Ukrainian western borders and the war will not end. The Iraqi army was very thoroughly destroyed and yet the insurgency still happened and it didn't end.\n\n\\- So what will happen is that *both* sides will continue fighting, suffering, and destroying one another until *both* sides find that it is preferable to sign a treaty and get it over with than continue fighting.\n\nNow, what makes Biddle interesting is that I heard about the same points that he was making in that 20th Feb 2024 FPRI podcast at a 24th May 2023 ... erm ... talk/lecture that Biddle gave to, I presume, [his church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWi32efwWI4). At about 56:00 he led a prayer, even. The interesting part is that at the time, which was about 2 weeks before the great summer offensive, Biddle opined that the Biden administration probably think that the Ukrainian offensive would underperform and achieve much less than it was hoped. Biddle even compared and contrasted the two extreme school of thoughts when it comes to US support for Ukraine: the realist school and the ultimate victory school and how he thinks both schools are wrong. Biddle's prognosis then and now was still that the fighting was to make both sides more agreeable with a negotiated settlement. \n\nThe only new things I've found was that \"the fastest way to break the stalemate will be for the US to cut all aid and support\". A deeply layered defensive system still requires a lot of ammunition and supplies, without which, it will collapse. Then the stalemate will end because the war is ended.",
