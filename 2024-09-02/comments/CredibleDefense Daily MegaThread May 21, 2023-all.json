                                "body": "An IR missile, a heat seeker, will key onto your exhaust yes. But these days most IR missiles are so-called \u2018all aspect,\u2019 meaning they\u2019ll track you from any direction. Typically tho most IR missiles are highly maneuverable, but short range. The Russians employ a medium range IR missile, but it\u2019s only so-so. It suffers from the mid-ground problem, it\u2019s not long range enough to beat other missiles, not small enough to preform like a short range missile. \n\nAll serious A2A missiles today are Active Radar missiles. That means that they have a tracker built into the nose cone which can assume tracking responsibilities if the missile loses its digital connection, or data link, to the firing platform. Head on or tail on doesn\u2019t matter much to these radar guided missiles. However their radars typically can\u2019t track for the full flight, they\u2019re small and a little insensitive, but inside 10-20ish NMi they can do all the tracking on their own. Once an active radar missile turns on its radar it goes \u2018pit bull\u2019 and tries to kill the first thing it sees, especially if it has lost its connection to a guiding platform. If the missile gets you on its radar, it will not let you go without a fight. \n\nIn BVR combat, everything is determined by the amount of total energy a missile has as it leaves the launch rail. Think Kerbal Space program. Each rocket has a set amount of delta v, which you start  consuming the second you hit the space bar. Missiles likewise have so much energy, a fixed amount built into the rocket motor plus the energy of the plane traveling forwards (the faster the launch platform, the more energy a missile has). The missile constantly has to fight air drag, and also maneuver to hit a target it locks on to. For most of its terminal lifespan the missile is literally falling onto an enemy target. There are two defenses against a long range missile attack. On old missiles you could \u2018notch\u2019 it by putting your aircraft side on to the missile and hoping the narrowest aspect of your plane would confuse the missile and make it miss. It\u2019s not the 1970s anymore, and that\u2019s really not a practical strategy. The other is to \u2018go cold\u2019 to the missile, you turn away and dive. By turning away you extend your distance to the missile and make it fly further to hit you. Obv good, because the missile has such a limited supply of energy. Second you dive. The closer to the earth you are, the thicker the air. Thick air increases drag, which uses up more missile energy to travel the same distance. A missile traveling through thick air below 5000ft may have 5x or more less range than the same missile at 35k ft. \n\nThere is a point, however, in which going cold will not save you. This is the MAR, or minimum abort range. Inside the MAR the missile has so much energy left you cannot evade it, it will catch you, and you will die. This is known as being \u2018turbo fucked.\u2019 There are tricks to getting out of this sticky situation, but they rely on a very narrow set of circumstances. You have to be going very fast, very low, maneuver very erratically, AND hope you get lucky enough that the missile kills itself hitting something instead of killing you. Typically tho pilots are trained to understand MAR at various altitudes for various missiles, and so you abort before entering MAR. The problem Ukraine has with the MIGs are that the R-37 is huge and has so much energy it\u2019s MAR is massive, and it basically means any pilot is going to need to go cold and go home at the first hint of a Russian response, rather than risk their airframe trying to get away from a spicy missile.",

The Russians employ a medium range IR missile, but it\u2019s only so-so. It suffers from the mid-ground problem, it\u2019s not long range enough to beat other missiles, not small enough to preform like a short range missile. </p>\n\n<p>All serious A2A missiles today are Active Radar missiles. That means that they have a tracker built into the nose cone which can assume tracking responsibilities if the missile loses its digital connection, or data link, to the firing platform. Head on or tail on doesn\u2019t matter much to these radar guided missiles. However their radars typically can\u2019t track for the full flight, they\u2019re small and a little insensitive, but inside 10-20ish NMi they can do all the tracking on their own. Once an active radar missile turns on its radar it goes \u2018pit bull\u2019 and tries to kill the first thing it sees, especially if it has lost its connection to a guiding platform. If the missile gets you on its radar, it will not let you go without a fight. </p>\n\n<p>In BVR combat, everything is determined by the amount of total energy a missile has as it leaves the launch rail. Think Kerbal Space program. Each rocket has a set amount of delta v, which you start  consuming the second you hit the space bar. Missiles likewise have so much energy, a fixed amount built into the rocket motor plus the energy of the plane traveling forwards (the faster the launch platform, the more energy a missile has). The missile constantly has to fight air drag, and also maneuver to hit a target it locks on to. For most of its terminal lifespan the missile is literally falling onto an enemy target. There are two defenses against a long range missile attack. On old missiles you could \u2018notch\u2019 it by putting your aircraft side on to the missile and hoping the narrowest aspect of your plane would confuse the missile and make it miss. It\u2019s not the 1970s anymore, and that\u2019s really not a practical strategy. The other is to \u2018go cold\u2019 to the missile, you turn away and dive. By turning away you extend your distance to the missile and make it fly further to hit you. Obv good, because the missile has such a limited supply of energy. Second you dive. The closer to the earth you are, the thicker the air. Thick air increases drag, which uses up more missile energy to travel the same distance. A missile traveling through thick air below 5000ft may have 5x or more less range than the same missile at 35k ft. </p>\n\n<p>There is a point, however, in which going cold will not save you. This is the MAR, or minimum abort range. Inside the MAR the missile has so much energy left you cannot evade it, it will catch you, and you will die. This is known as being \u2018turbo fucked.\u2019 There are tricks to getting out of this sticky situation, but they rely on a very narrow set of circumstances. You have to be going very fast, very low, maneuver very erratically, AND hope you get lucky enough that the missile kills itself hitting something instead of killing you. Typically tho pilots are trained to understand MAR at various altitudes for various missiles, and so you abort before entering MAR. The problem Ukraine has with the MIGs are that the R-37 is huge and has so much energy it\u2019s MAR is massive, and it basically means any pilot is going to need to go cold and go home at the first hint of a Russian response, rather than risk their airframe trying to get away from a spicy missile.</p>\n</div>",

Russia first took the flanks before taking most of the city\n\n1. for the majority of the fighting the road of life was very very narrow and under Russian fire control. Crossing it was very dangerous. That meant that actions such as resupply, evacuation, troop rotations or surges were all very dangerous. Ukraine was building a large deficit in war material within the city. Sure, they didn't run low on small arms ammo, but bigger ammo gets significantly heavier quickly.

This sort of reminds me of the SAT question type where there are two columns of items and you have to draw lines between the correct matching pairs. Can anyone draw the escalation ladder showing the rungs below us that have already been passed? Were electrical grid strikes a response to the Kerch Bridge bombing?

Maybe the best example of this, because it is one of the most bizarre, is that providing non-Western jets is widely deemed as normal but providing Western jets represents an escalation.\n* The predicted reaction to an escalation varies between *will* react and *could* (now has the ability to) react. I don\u2019t know if this makes sense in this war because most of the potential reactions from Russia are not constrained by ability. Putin does not seem to require more political cover in order to escalate, nor does any escalation seem to otherwise give him the ability to do anything he wouldn\u2019t already do. He ordered the assassination of Zelensky from day one, for example. The Russian escalation ladder therefore seems to be a ladder missing all of the rungs before nuclear weapons. And the Western escalation ladder wouldn't make sense if this is true, because there needs to be a corresponding rung representing potential reactions to each Western action.\n* A more powerful explanatory logic for actions and reactions comes from explicit promises such as China promising to provide arms if Ukraine attempts assassinations of leaders in Moscow, or the West indicating that they will sink the Black Sea Fleet if nuclear weapons are used. These specific signals are much more reliable for prediction, understood by all, and more important than the supposed-but-not-seen escalation ladder. These promises seem to be the most valid cases of escalation logic holding true, but escalation logic isn\u2019t required here because these are explicit promises and don\u2019t need any theory to understand them.\n* There are many exceptions and ways to undermine the supposed escalation ladder and prevent the adversary from being able to react to your escalation \u2013 using **covert action** (Nordstream), using **salami tactics** and slowly working into a new status quo (Russian attacks on civilians, torture of prisoners, Ukrainian small attacks within Russia), using **psychological timing** that causes an escalation to seem non-escalatory (attacking Engels base during Russian air strike), using **junior partners** to spearhead the escalation (Iran weapons, Poland weapons, Medvedev verbal escalations). These tactics basically come down to ways to remove the appearance of control by the instigator or remove clarity from the reactor. We have even seen NATO simply **slow-walk** each phase of new weapons systems by pretending to agonize over delivering them and then slowly salami their way through approving training, then approving small deliveries, then approving larger deliveries. There are so many tactics that allow actors to undermine the theory of escalation that this theory/logic no longer seems to govern the conflict at all.\n* As a thought exercise, imagine if a Ukrainian team was tasked with devising a plan to undermine the escalatory potential of the initial Ukrainian incursion into Crimea. How could Ukraine attack Crimea without handing Putin the ability to use more powerful weapons? Maybe attack the same day that a new atrocity like Bucha is uncovered and announced to the world, with the attack on Crimea then being characterized as the response instead of as its own act?\n\nI am not sure if this is Ukraine-specific or whether the entire theory of escalation is something akin to FBI profiling, where successful predictions are counted as part of the theory and unsuccessful ones are revised/ignored and overall there is a speciousness but the power of the idea is too attractive to get dumped from practice.",

In part of your answer you actually seem to agree with what I've said about the Russian side of the escalation ladder only having one important rung (nuclear). The fact that Ukraine simply turning/winning the war is considered an escalation by Russia (as in your firm example of the successful Kharkiv offensive, which I mostly agree with) reduces the power of this framework. The West has already permanently decided that they will not let nuclear powers win wars of aggression by wielding the threat of nuclear escalation. If Russia considers not being allowed to win to be escalatory then we are simply at the nuclear rung at all times with that decision being the only one remaining. \n\nEscalation feels one-sided here. This reminds me that other critics of the theory of 'the escalation canard' in these megathreads have said \"if Russia *could* do something strategically more successful, they *would* without waiting for an escalation.\" I agree with that logic and it seems to mesh with your description of Russia simply reacting with their best  and most appropriate strategy at any time. But action/reaction does not seem to automatically be the same as escalation -- if it is then escalation is a loaded word that pretends to have more meaning. I don't mean to be so stuck on semantics but I feel like the conversation is important because people using the word escalation in their analyses seem to think it has enough weight that it should dictate Western actions in a different way than simply calling things action/reaction (possible strawman, sorry). \n\nLike you, I also consider the explicit tit-for-tat promises by China/NATO to be real escalations, but as I said in my original post I don't think these require any theory to be analyzed -- they are simple and obvious promises. The way escalation is used in coverage of the war purports to have a deeper explanatory power, like why the West have/haven't delivered certain conventional weapons systems (outside of those governed by Chinese promises) and indeed why they  should/shouldn't do so.",

Russia will always have the ability to engage in BDA.

They didn't want to admit that Russia had some degree of competence. As mentioned before, it was difficult to hide the strikes during the winter. When there is suddenly no electricity, you can't continuously claim a 100% shot down, regardless of whether footage exists or not.\r  \n\r  \nAnother important point that needs to be addressed, which I don't think anyone has really noticed, is that Ukraine has changed the way they intercept missiles heading for Kyiv. They no longer shoot them down well outside the city limits; instead, they attempt to take them down with anti-aircraft fire and a limited amount of missiles first. The result is that their anti-aircraft work appears a lot worse (even if it is not).\r  \n\r  \nThe TB2 drone incident clearly exemplified this. The drone was flying over Maidan, and only a few days ago, there were shaheds over Maidan. This is not a good look, especially for someone like Ukraine, who claims a 100% shot down ratio over Kyiv. This number is obviously made up and exaggerated. Consider the fact that suddenly there are multiple reports of debris causing damage, which was never the case before.

                "body": "This exact point comes up in the famous Athens-Melian debate ([the Melian Dialogue](http://academics.wellesley.edu/ClassicalStudies/CLCV102/Thucydides--MelianDialogue.html)) in Thucydides! Impossible to know if it actually happened, my money is on no, but it highlights how Thucydides as an Athenian policymaker and Strategos thought of their empire. Well worth the read, its a foundational strategic policy text. Like with Plato, all grand strategy ultimately either sides with the Athenians or the Melians. \n\nAnyway the relevant section:\n\n>When you speak of the favour of the gods, we may as fairly hope for that as yourselves; neither our pretensions nor our conduct being in any way contrary to what men believe of the gods, or practise among themselves. **Of the gods we believe, and of men we know, that by a necessary law of their nature they rule wherever they can. And it is not as if we were the first to make this law, or to act upon it when made: we found it existing before us, and shall leave it to exist for ever after us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing that you and everybody else, having the same power as we have, would do the same as we do.** Thus, as far as the gods are concerned, we have no fear and no reason to fear that we shall be at a disadvantage. But when we come to your notion about the Lacedaemonians (Spartans), which leads you to believe that shame will make them help you, here we bless your simplicity but do not envy your folly. The Lacedaemonians, when their own interests or their country's laws are in question, are the worthiest men alive; of their conduct towards others much might be said, but no clearer idea of it could be given than by shortly saying that of all the men we know they are most conspicuous in considering what is agreeable honourable, and what is expedient just. Such a way of thinking does not promise much for the safety which you now unreasonably count upon.\n\nTo contextualize, the Melians lay out a series of arguments based in justice, morality, and finally come to a religious argument. The gods will recognize the justice of their cause and will, as a consequence, come to the Melian's rescue. The Athenians reject this on three grounds. First, the Athenians see themselves as a just and morale people, and so the gods should naturally also protect them. Moreover, the gods are often split among who the support in wars, we see this in the Iliad. Third, the Spartans are no more just because theyre on the Melians' side and are just using the Melians for their own imperial purposes. Thus there is no mismatch in justice, Melos is about to become an imperial subject no matter what. \n\nThe second rejection is the most interesting tho, and it sets the use of power up as a natural force so strong even the gods themselves obey it. Its the reality of power, it exists as an instrument for states to use if they can. Great powers have the strength to overwhelm smaller states, and so make use of that power for their own ends. Athens did it to Melos as others had done before them, and have done ever since then, and as the gods themselves did to each other and to humanity. Later in the dialogue the Athenians suggest that they would indeed rather lose their empire to the Spartans, another great power, than to Melos a small power which would become an abusive great power. In the context of the religious debate Thucydides makes a second interesting power. This reality of power law is not a matter of justice, it is not unjust to act in conformity with the natural order. The use of power by those who have it (the strong who do as they will, while the weak do as they must) is not inherently unjust. Nor is the defense of ones own empire unjust. This is interesting as I'd argue Thucydides became quite the critic of late-war Athenian policy, and may himself have even argued it became unjust. But its in how the war was planned, executed, and its grand aims that make wars just or unjust, not in the application of imperial privilege. \n\nI have always felt like this dialogue hits on the fundamental bedrock of the international system. Empires and the agglomeration of power is a natural consequence of statehood. Some states rise while others fall. Those states on the rise can apply their power to dominate and control other states. Arguing if its right or wrong misses the point, its unavoidable. And were a state to break their sword, as the Athenians suggest others would just turn it against them anyway. What changed, I would argue, in the age of the wars of ideology in the 20th century was that imperial powers realized that you cant just dominate other states as the Athenians had, as the Nazis tried to, and ultimately as the Soviets failed to. We are seeing this play out again in Ukraine. You cant dominate states like that long term anymore. Instead, the American volunteer empire is so powerful and lasting not because states like the US, and not because the US dominates its allies and clients. Its durable because, yeah, Taiwan *could* bounce of the western sphere, it *could* dedollarize, it *could* disarm and reject power politics. The US would certainly not invade it or try to compel it back into the western sphere. But Taiwan, South Korea, Eastern Europe, and others, wont do that because they see that their best interests lay in joining with the US to ensure mutual security. America is different in that, with the exception of Iraq, you arnt *forced* into the empire. You join it. \n\nIronically Star Trek Deep Space Nine had one of the most insightful understandings of the American empire, and in one of the most famous scenes compares it to [root beer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VhSm6G7cVk)",
