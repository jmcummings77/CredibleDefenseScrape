      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

The autocratic/tyranic/multipolar order whatever we want to call it has limited allies and is struggeling to gain members, specially with russia&#39;s war and China&#39;s wolf diplomacy.</p>\n\n<p>Since then NATO, corner stone of the Western alliance would made russia&#39;s Baltic aspirations over.</p>\n\n<p>The economy is smaller then russia, yes (togather they put out more then half of it) but the gdp/capita? 15 million with around 5 times of russias. You would need Switzerland and a few other ones to just call it the alliance of developed nations. In other worlds, you are leading and getting away far faster then the second could hope to catch up.</p>\n\n<p>I might be wrong but the organic/natural evolution I see for NATO is to join into a single bloc with other US lead alliances. It will be a hard as hell process, only possible by its ridiculis weight/power that it represent. Not in the next 10 years for sure. However that is &quot;only&quot; possible with moves like this. Showing that it hasnt reached some kind of limit, its sun isnt going down but ever forward.</p>\n\n<p>I know it is idealistic, still, it just cannot be denied.</p>\n</div>",

To say that I've been pleasantly surprised is quite the understatement. \n\nIn particular, the steps the Biden administration has taken to weaken, isolate, and contain China have been way beyond my expectations. Not only did Biden continue the trade war with China, he's kicked it up to 11 with his ban on advanced chips (bringing Japan and the Netherlands into the embargo greatly strengthens the measure) and his [recent executive order](https://www.reuters.com/world/white-house-detail-plans-restricting-some-us-investments-china-source-2023-08-09/), while not as strict as it could have been, still has quite some teeth. The Biden administration is also [increasingly cracking down on Chinese imports using the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-imports-auto-parts-face-scrutiny-under-law-chinese-forced-labor-2023-08-17/). The goal is to cripple China's advanced tech industry, and also help facilitate a \"divorce\" between the economies of the West and China, which appears to be accelerating as direct foreign investment in China falls off a cliff and their economic prospects rapidly deteriorate.\n\nBiden's administration has also taken steps to strengthen US relationships in Asia in an effort to contain China. This includes [Biden's personal efforts to mend the relationship between South Korea and Japan](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/18/at-camp-david-biden-hails-next-era-of-partnership-between-us-south-korea-and-japan-00111901) which are already bearing fruit, US support for Japan's rearmament and revisions to its constitution, strengthening the US-UK-AU trilateral relationship through AUKUS, a [defense pact with Papua New Guinea](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/22/asia/us-papua-new-guinea-defense-cooperation-agreement-intl-hnk/index.html), pulling the Philippines back into the US orbit [which has led to renewed US access to multiple bases in close proximity to Taiwan](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3349257/philippines-us-announce-locations-of-four-new-edca-sites/), a recent [stategic partnership agreement with Vietnam](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/18/biden-vietnam-partnership-00111939), and [efforts to improve relations with India](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-look-at-india-us-relations-as-prime-minister-modi-visits-the-white-house/). Biden has also issued a number of statements that the US would absolutely defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, though these have been walked back repeatedly by other members of the administration. On top of that, the Biden admin has also been pressuring European countries to reconsider their relationships with China, with mixed results. \n\nTaken altogether, it's hard not to see these efforts and feel like the US is making surprisingly rapid progress in its efforts to contain China on multiple fronts. Personally, I'd like to see Biden rejoin talks to join the TPP (or whatever it's being called these days) as part of an effort to further economically isolate China and build US ties with governments in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, but if that happens it's unlikely until a second Biden term if at all.",

Basically force your consumers to only do business with those domestic producers. So you'll end up with lower quality and higher prices over time which means lower real incomes.

As far as PRC is concerned, DPRK is very stable and just about the perfect buffer state just by existing and taking all the ire from USA first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The question asked what the PRC could do to improve their foreign policy image. To generalize my answer, I think they could take concrete steps to improve stability, predictability, and likely peace throughout their sphere of greatest influence.\n\nI'm suggesting, KJU is not gonna cooperate with your fan fiction unification route and there isn't really anything PRC can offer to make it worthwhile for him/his regime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The DPRK is a convenient buffer, with the US military presence in the RoK. In the short term, the US will be on a nation which shares their border, which they obviously don't want. In the longer term, without the DPRK and their associated threat of invasion, their is much less incentive (for RoK and the U.S.) to maintain such a large and costly basing strategy. Their is in fact, an incentive for both nations to cash in on a peace dividend in the area.\n\nNow, this - peaceful unification/absorption - would never happen like you are describing, but you can take your mortgage and bet all on the US not withdrawing bases from the Korean peninsula IF it was unified under ROK's terms i.e West/east Germany scenario.  Those US bases in current ROK is the closest foothold US has on the Asian continent against the main rival and there is NO WAY in hell USA is getting rid of them.  US didn't get rid of German bases after their unification so why would they do it here??\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The DPRK is also only as stable as they are due to PRC support. They are well positioned to negotiate an safe abdication in return for peaceful reunification. If they tell Kim et al, to leave with their money and have legal protection within China or stand alone, their is a strong incentive to leave. Also, ending the Korean war is a claim that the PRC will be able to use to sell their negotiating clout, as they were able to succeed where the U.S. has not.\n\nSo, PRC wants \"stability, predictability, and likely peace\" but it is gonna take a wild shot by dumping its ally and see what happens after??  DPRK regime was strong enough to withstand the 1990's famine where unofficially killed somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-10% of its overall population.  What makes you think DPRK/KJU would just take it up their ass when PRC tells them to take a hike? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>All of this sells China as a force for stability and peace far more than words ever would. Do I expect the PRC to actually try such a plan, no, obviously. Their actions and rhetoric make this seem as much a fantasy as you mentioned. I merely said it would be a good method to improve their perceived standing in the geopolitical world and would, in the long term, serve in their favor.\n\nBut, it has to be something remotely realistic.  Why not suggest CCP to abdicate/capitulate and let Taiwan to take over Chinese mainland?  That would foster the stability and peace far more than the Korean unification gamble.  PRC's diplomatic/military pressure tactics on Taiwan are the one of if not the main reason why PRC is perceived so negatively around the world at the moment.  When CCP was minding its own business in 1990's and early 2000's, US wasn't talking about the PRC containment even though DPRK was causing same problems.",

Commanders had to drive to the battlefield to be in radio range, risking themselves,\u201d Mykola said. \u201cIt was chaos.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule\">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/28/elon-musks-shadow-rule</a></p>\n\n<p>The entire article is worth the read.</p>\n\n<p>What a liability that guy is.</p>\n</div>",

An operation intended to destroy NATO and the EU in a minor military operation.\n\n\\- Ethnic Russians riot in Narva in North-East Estonia (funded, armed and coordinated by Russia).\n\n\\- Russian troops cross the border and seize the town on Narva and dig in. Probably deny direct involvement.\n\n\\- Estonia is incapable of pushing Russians out on our own, rely on NATO military force to expulse the Russian invasion.\n\n\\- NATO says that we don't want war with Russia and maybe it's more of an internal policing action anyways.\n\n\\- NATO and EU are incapable of defending their member states from direct foreign invasion, marking an abrupt end to the organizations. USA just leaves, France+Germany will form a new West European community organization and restore relations with Russia. Eastern Europe is rightfully expelled from the new international world order as independent actors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone going to say that this is impossible, please address your counter-arguments to the Estonian military and internal security agency, as they are absolutely going to be interested in how you are so sure.",

An operation intended to destroy NATO and the EU in a minor military operation.</p>\n\n<p>- Ethnic Russians riot in Narva in North-East Estonia (funded, armed and coordinated by Russia).</p>\n\n<p>- Russian troops cross the border and seize the town on Narva and dig in. Probably deny direct involvement.</p>\n\n<p>- Estonia is incapable of pushing Russians out on our own, rely on NATO military force to expulse the Russian invasion.</p>\n\n<p>- NATO says that we don&#39;t want war with Russia and maybe it&#39;s more of an internal policing action anyways.</p>\n\n<p>- NATO and EU are incapable of defending their member states from direct foreign invasion, marking an abrupt end to the organizations. USA just leaves, France+Germany will form a new West European community organization and restore relations with Russia. Eastern Europe is rightfully expelled from the new international world order as independent actors.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Anyone going to say that this is impossible, please address your counter-arguments to the Estonian military and internal security agency, as they are absolutely going to be interested in how you are so sure.</p>\n</div>",

Yet despite it being clear to literally everyone else in the world that he wildly overestimated both the capabilities of his own military and the willingness of the Ukrainian people to tolerate Russian domination of their country, he has not relaxed his maximalist objectives in Ukraine at all.

It's reasonable to presume his future behavior will resemble his past behavior. Particularly because his propaganda narrative paints him into a corner. He got the ultranationalists all riled up about Ukraine and would have to bribe or bully them into supporting a ceasefire to avoid destabilizing his regime, likely by promising to prosecute the war with renewed vigor at a later, more opportune moment.\n\n> It's hard to see how, under these circumstances, Putin would favour yet another military adventure abroad, whether in Ukraine or elsewhere.\n\nMany people made precisely that same argument in the weeks leading up to the invasion. Just because it is obviously a bad idea to us does not mean Putin perceives it as such. He is insensitive to the costs his actions incur and so willing to continue with an incredibly inadvisable course of action no matter how much damage he does to Russia.\n\nClearly none of the setbacks the Russians have experienced have affected Putin's desire to dominate Ukraine. That suggests he does not consider the failures to be flaws in the ideological framework he used to justify the war, but rather limited errors of execution that have more to do with the specific peculiarities of the specific Russian generals who planned the war and with the west's \"war\" against Russia than it has to do with the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of his anachronistic imperialist ideology.\n\nLast, the threat that Ukraine poses to Putin will persist and in all probability increase over time with a ceasefire in place and therefore is more rather than less likely to provoke violent backlash from Putin. Specifically, an economically successful, democratic Ukraine aligned closely with the EU would show the whole world the viability of establishing a thriving liberal democracy deep in the heart of Slavic Eastern Europe and the former USSR. That will highlight Russia's failures as a state simply by serving as a foil to Russia's deeply corrupt and incompetent government. Ukraine can demonstrate to the Russian people what can be accomplished when the people reject a tyrannical government of the oligarchs, embrace democracy and rule of law, and exercise their inherent right to self-determination. After Russia's profound military and geopolitical failures over the past 18 months, Putin will if anything be more rather than less afraid of the threat posed by a revitalized Ukraine because it undermines his legitimacy and highlights the practical stupidity of his invasion. Putin is wily but brutal, direct, and unimaginative. I don't see him thinking of a better solution to his Ukraine problem just because the war didn't work out the way he wanted. Instead, he will likely react to his fear the same way he did in 2022, by lashing out violently.",

If reunification happens and the government in charge is the current government instead of the communist lovin Kim young Un up north, that mean unified Korea received a tons of young cheap labor force so they don't have to outsource it to south east asia, while the North Korean can solve their food security problems by international market instead of relying on their poor soils being acidified by years of over fertilizing. South Korea also gain access to the minerals rich of the northern mountains and reducing their aging population with highest rate among east Asia \n\n\nHonestly depending on how it play out but unified Korea can potentially become a regional power like Japan back in 70-80s. Another thing i find interesting is: South Korea policy is bound to USA. Not just because SK economy depends a lot on US/western market but also as long a the neighbor up north keep pointing nuclear missiles at them, they are bound for US for security assistance. But if Korea is unified, the threat of NK no more, while, hypothetically like i said the economic power of Korea would be boosted a lot thanks to the north, I wonder if they would break up the current relationship with USA, building their own capable army and starting their own foreign policy for their own interests.",

            "body": "I have a feeling I might regret this later but I'm going to risk an answer :-).\n\nI'm going to start with probably the least important reason because I think it provides some useful context for the more important reasons. Human behaviour, even within a single behavioural pattern, falls on a spectrum, so when you talk about a broad enough group of people like the tens or hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, no general statement can have universal value.\n\nSo while the Russian army *in general* is prone to war crimes on account of an institutional tradition of reprisals, a gradual breakdown of discipline and leadership tradition starting with the late Soviet era, and a cultural and educational tradition of minimising reports and marginalising victims, that does not mean they screen volunteers and officers for war crime proneness and reject the ones that might get iffy about them. Like in every army, there are are COs who abhor inflicting violence upon the unarmed and command the respect of their subordinates, COs who are in it for the power and will absolutely let their subordinates loose on the civilians, COs who wish their subordinates did not engage in war crimes but are unable to control them and so on. And there are men who enlisted because they need the money for their wives' cancer treatments and men who enlisted because it's their one chance to fulfill their violent sexual fantasies.\n\nConsequently, you are going to observe contradictory behaviour within any large enough group, both people who will stay low, try to survive, and come home with a fat stack of cash, and people who go out of their way to torture. Neither behaviour is universally descriptive of the larger group because *no* behaviour can be, except for things like basic anatomy (e.g. everybody poops).\n\nSecond reason: most of the war crimes tend to happen in occupation areas, not frontlines. Frontline areas are largely devoid of population -- not entirely, since not everyone wants to leave and forced removal is sometimes impossible (and sometimes deliberately incomplete), but there's not that many people left. And staying alive tends to take priority over electrocuting people in basements. So the people doing the torturing and the people holding the frontlines are usually disjoint groups.\n\nWe tend to think of the more heinous examples of war crimes in Ukraine from the early war as having occurred on the frontlines (e.g. in Irpin) but that's not quite the case. There was fighting in Irpin, as confrontation was very fluid at the time, but pretty much all the documented atrocities, from the ones we saw on camera to the ones prosecutors managed to piece together, happened while the town was under full occupation and the fighting was far enough that soldiers could safely roam the streets and hunker down in buildings for days, fearful and tense, but safe from enemy action.\n\nSimilarly, most of the atrocities happening these days are going to be committed in Mariupol or Berdyansk, not in Robotyne or Urozhaine. The contradiction between committing atrocities and holding the frontline is largely a geographical conflation, they mostly happen in different parts.\n\nThird, morale is also not universally distributed, so neither is the kind of behaviour influenced by it. It's not universal in terms of either quality (\"good\" vs. \"bad\") nor in terms of mechanisms. The way people react to various developments around them can vary tremendously, even in the presence of the same influencing factor: bad morale and hopelesness will be met by some with apathy and resignation, and by others with fury and rash behaviour. So bad morale, even if it were universal (which it rarely is), won't have exactly the same effect, and produce the exact same behaviour, everywhere in occupied areas and on the front lines.",

And staying alive tends to take priority over electrocuting people in basements. So the people doing the torturing and the people holding the frontlines are usually disjoint groups.</p>\n\n<p>We tend to think of the more heinous examples of war crimes in Ukraine from the early war as having occurred on the frontlines (e.g. in Irpin) but that&#39;s not quite the case. There was fighting in Irpin, as confrontation was very fluid at the time, but pretty much all the documented atrocities, from the ones we saw on camera to the ones prosecutors managed to piece together, happened while the town was under full occupation and the fighting was far enough that soldiers could safely roam the streets and hunker down in buildings for days, fearful and tense, but safe from enemy action.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, most of the atrocities happening these days are going to be committed in Mariupol or Berdyansk, not in Robotyne or Urozhaine. The contradiction between committing atrocities and holding the frontline is largely a geographical conflation, they mostly happen in different parts.</p>\n\n<p>Third, morale is also not universally distributed, so neither is the kind of behaviour influenced by it. It&#39;s not universal in terms of either quality (&quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot;) nor in terms of mechanisms. The way people react to various developments around them can vary tremendously, even in the presence of the same influencing factor: bad morale and hopelesness will be met by some with apathy and resignation, and by others with fury and rash behaviour. So bad morale, even if it were universal (which it rarely is), won&#39;t have exactly the same effect, and produce the exact same behaviour, everywhere in occupied areas and on the front lines.</p>\n</div>",

Or they make the sacrifices to their offensive by shifting units and resources to defend the Kupiansk-Svatove-Kreminna Line.  </p>\n\n<p>The UAF have already done the latter, they have reinforced that location already, to include with 10th Corps units that were meant for the offensive. So it remains to be seen whether it&#39;ll have an effect on the UAF offensive.</p>\n</div>",
