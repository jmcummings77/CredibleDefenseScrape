        "body": "Understanding the Ukrainian Ground Forces\n\n  The structure and units of the Ukrainian Army are incredibly opaque; Not through an abundance of military caution, so much as because of historical and political quirks in the formation/control of units. It\u2019s all publicly available knowledge, it just isn\u2019t all that understandable. I\u2019m going to take a crack at summarizing it. \n\nThe Army\n\nThe first and primary structure to understand are the Ground Forces of Ukraine, or alternatively, the Ukrainian army.  Before the Current Phase of the War (BCP, the post February 22, 2022 period), the ground forces consisted of 9 mechanized brigades, 4 motorized brigades, 2 mountain brigades and 3 tank brigades.   Mechanized brigades, the standard unit of the UAF, historically consist of 3 mechanized infantry battalions, a tank battalion, an artillery battalion, a recon squadron and various other support units (AA, med, maintenance, HQ, MP, ect.) The UAF uses battalion structures, but doesn\u2019t organize Battalion Tactical Groups, reserving specialized forces for the Brigade level. The motorized brigades are lighter, organized from territorial defense Brigades (TDF) volunteers in 2016 to meet the AFU\u2019s quick need for more units in the Donbas, and are three infantry battalions, a lighter artillery battalion and support units.   All 4 are \u2018scheduled\u2019 to transition into full mechanized brigades, but time makes fools of us all.  The Active Army Reserve consisted of an additional 6 brigades of mechanized infantry, with a goal of deployment within 60 days of activation.\n \nThe army has grown markedly over the last 10 months, and now consists of 4 motorized brigades, 2 mountain brigades, 14 Mechanized infantry brigades, 3 tank brigades and 10 smaller units I will be calling \u2018proto brigades\u201d (see discussion below).  Additionally, most of the BCP mechanized brigades have received a 4th infantry battalion.  The Active Reserve used more than 60 days to deploy, but the delay was the result of prudent additional training and organization, and now consists of 8 mechanized infantry brigades, two tank brigades and a Jaeger brigade.\n\nMountain and Jaeger brigades are essentially mechanized brigades which have received additional training/equipment appropriate to mountainous/forested terrain, but within the context of post BCP, are essentially very well-trained mechanized infantry.  Tank brigades consist of three tank battalions, a mechanized infantry battalion, and artillery.   Mechanized brigades muster approximately 3000-4000 men, and motorized/tank brigades approximately 2000-2500.  Taken all together, the army now consists of 33 Brigades and approximately 110,000 combat effectives, not counting smaller units, independent artillery brigades logistical and maintenance battalions and various support formations. \n\nThe ground forces also boast 10 independent artillery brigades, supplementing the brigades\u2019 organic artillery battalions.  These units vary widely in size, weaponry, mission and capability: most of the western supplied artillery/HIMARS are mustered in these units, and though incredibly useful, brigade is more of an honorific than true description of size and capabilities (though once full logistical/mechanical support troops are included, their total musters can be substantial. \n\nThe Air Assault Force\n\nOrganizationally separate from the Army itself, are the Air Assault forces (formerly the Air Mobile Division). Under Soviet organization, this force is not considered part of the ground forces, but its own separate command. BCP the command consisted of Air mobile and air assault brigades. The distinction between is fuzzy, but BCP think of air mobile as light paratroopers and air assault as fast reaction mechanized infantry brigades.  These units were considered elite forces BCP receiving extra training (including with NATO) a special selection process and preferential access to weaponry, but most regular army mech brigades, having graduated from the school of hard knocks, are now comparable. The force consisted of 7 brigades/~ 20,000 men BCP but is now 9 brigades/~30,000 men. One of the new brigades is designated a jaeger brigade, but also calls itself a hunter/assault brigade, for reasons I am not privy to. 1 brigade, the 25th Air Mobile brigade, has not been deployed and may not be full strength/may still be pure \u2018air mobile\u2019 light force.   In the current conflict, the other 8 brigades have bulked up their armor/artillery to be comparable to other mechanized brigades. \n\nMarines\n\nThe Marines are another separate command of \u2018elite\u2019 troops.  After 9 months on the Mariupol /Kherson fronts, it\u2019s two brigades (plus an extra battalion) have lost their distinctiveness and transitioned into mechanized infantry brigades, much as the Air Assault units have. \n\nTerritorial Defense Forces \n\nThe territorial forces are a reserve/militia.  The vast majority of Ukrainian volunteers have been funneled into this organization, with a paper authorization of 130,000 men in 150 battalions plus a plethora of specialized units and detachments.  Most battalions are well over their authorized strength. Their primary assignment is to distinct geographic areas/ciites. In militarily active sectors the TDF is organized into 5 battalion Brigades (TDBs) with mortar detachments, but no armor/artillery. As a result, several TBDs find their way into the line in pretty much every active front; At any given time, 8-12 brigades are active in the front. Though their mission is primarily defensive, they enthusiastically participate in active operations when appropriate. The defending forces of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and the Belarus border are primarily TDF forces.  \n\nThe TDF also commands a bewildering assortment of volunteer infantry companies, including all the units of the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. Ranging anywhere from company  to brigade strength and organized by country, primarily light infantry (though some have leveled up).  The total strength of the legion is 20,000-25,000 effectives, with (more or less) 8 units large enough to be called a regiment or brigade. \n\nThe National Guard\n\n If you thought the TDF was confusing, welcome to the Interior Ministry. The National Guard isn\u2019t part of the defense department, though they cooperate with army commands.  Primarily a Gendarmerie,  the NG maintained 4 full mechanized brigades BCP, and retains two (2 were reorganized  to the AFU over the summer).  In addition, the NG commands numerous security brigades, deployed to the rear of AFU units at the front and in cities/border areas: Wherever one finds a TDB, a NG security battalion is near by.   But for the purposes of the army in the field, The NG supplies two rapid reaction mechanized brigades. \n\nSummary\n\nRolling it all together the Ukrainian Army in the field consists of 45 fully operational brigades. TDBs provide a further 8-10 light brigades at any one time, with many more deployed on the northern border areas or protecting northern cities. A variable collection of ~20 smaller units, artillery brigades and the foreign legion units  provide additional forces .\nThough the total size of the Ukrainian ground forces grew markedly over the first ten months of war, only 8  new brigades have been formed. Freshly trained troops in the first six months brought reserve brigades up to full strength and formed a replacement pool used to keep existing units combat effective. Of the 8 new formed units, one was an air assault brigade formed primarily from called up veterans and a second existed as a reserve unit down to a leadership core. But the army has started fielding new mechanized brigades and a pattern has formed.  The 47th brigade was formed around the 47th Assault regiment and the 66th Mech collected several previously independent battalions.   The UAF appears disinclined to form new units out of exclusively fresh troops, preferring to beef up a veteran core. \n\nThis is speculation, but I believe the pattern shows additional new formed units in the pipeline.  The UAF has started listing the 5th Assault regiment and 9 independent rifle battalions on their table or organization.  I consider these to be \u2018proto brigades\u2019, working up to full strength as artillery and tank battalions (plus specialty detachments ) become available.  I would be surprised if all 9 of the independent battalions continue their solitary existence, I would expect several to join each other to create the next crop of assault regiments.  And look for the 5th Mechanized infantry brigade to suddenly appear!\n\n/ I did this on the fly, and mostly to organize it in my own head. so if you spot something I should correct, please let me know.\n\nEdit: I wish to note that I didn't include Special ops forces and units in my summary, as they aren't traditional units, don't occupy the line and are often outside the chain of command. However, The forces are substantial, perhaps 10,000 men all told, once one counts the marines, Kraken and several other specialized/independent groupings.",

Putin himself has said something like \"there's no such thing as an ex KBG officer\" multiple times.\n\nFor english sources John Schindler is ok. He's kinda pandered to the alt right crowd in recent years, but he does actually know a ton about this topic academically. I think at some point he tweeted a bunch of recommended sources.\n\nBut if you're unfamiliar, Chekism is not a conspiracy theory, it's very much the conscious ideology of FSB, previously KGB.

The weakness he displayed by voluntarily pulling out of a \"conflict\" that the US could have kept the lid on indefinitely was one of if not the final nail in the Russian strategic calculus that the United States was weak, Ukraine was thus weak, and Russia had \"proven\" itself against Georgia and \"terrorists\" in Syria- nevermind Kasham of course.\n\nThe United States accepting some sort of capitulation on Ukraine's behalf signals to the world that America will abandon you in your moment of need to save its own skin. I dont doubt Joe Biden would love to go down this road knowing the history of his stances on Iraq and what he did to cause the Afghan collapse. But this time it could do critical damage to American reputation as a peacemaker, and Im betting there are saner heads in the administration who recognize that only a total Russian reversal out of the complete borders of Ukraine is both the minimum and maximum of what the United States wants",

I don't even know if an end to the war is likely even if Ukraine miraculously pushes the Russians out entirely. It could very likely just become a frozen conflict over time without any settlement.\n\nIf Russia would continue to strike civilian infrastructure after that, Ukraine might even seriously start an offensive on Russian soil as a response which can lead to more serious escalation. It's impossible to predict at this point since a lot has to change for this hypothetical to happen. If Ukraine manages to push out Russia entirely, it's going to be on Russia to accept the loss, not Ukraine, so the point about Ukraine having to be open for negotiations in that scenario is moot.
