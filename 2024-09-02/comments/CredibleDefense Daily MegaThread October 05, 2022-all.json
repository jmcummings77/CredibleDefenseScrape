This trend really started the sea change (Los Angeles / Calgary were the first ones to really take advantage).\n\nOne huge problem now, is actually security. Ever since Munich security's been stricter, however since the 2000s, security is crazy. The amount of IPPs you have at one of these events is enormous. As well as the many venues. Keep in mind, they need to secure them not only for the actual event, but up to two months before.  There's a reason why those dedicated lanes exist (Not just for the 2000 vehicle fleet that exists to shuttle the masses of equipment (What the US sends in for it's players is absolutely, absolutely insane, several sea-cans worth of stores/comfort items etc at least), players, staff, between venues).\n\nAlso the technology and radio infrastructure is something to behold, and something I am not surprised that Ukraine isn't trying to leverage (TETRA etc for secured digital radio networks that are low cost, and can be rapidly deployed.)\n\nThose debacles have 100% done that, at least in the west. The other is a lot more joined up thinking in generating bid books. All levels of government are involved. There is also a move to leased equipment now, and reuse of everything, from beds, to towels, to sports equipment. The cost of presenting a bid, due to the increased security and construction costs reduced the amount of bidders, so the IOC had to change rules.

As well as the lack of corruption on all levels.  When I worked at that level, the baseball event, was done on a rented farmer's field, literally rented the field, put in 4 baseball fields + modular stands + infrastructure, and the land was returned, no stadium required. *There also was a gun range, that was upgraded to olympic standards, but had to be removed as the government deemed it unsafe for use as a range normally.* \n\nNormally, I think the sweet spot is 2-3 facilities of world class, a few smaller ones, especially if collocated with Universities, and the rest just temporary structures. The infrastructure work is the best part, normally 1-2 big ticket projects are going to be funded and completed rather quickly (8 year cycle from bid to games).",

        "body": "Some energy analysis:\n\n* OPEC+ did agree to a 2mmbpd cut, but for it to actually work, countries would have to lower production and lose market share. The transmission mechanism for both cuts, as well as hikes, from OPEC only seems to work haphazardly ever since the oil price crash in 2014. \n\n* U.S. production continues to soar and new production from Guyana and Brazil is also ramping up. The U.S. itself could probably increase its output by 1mmbpd starting next year according to the EIA. \n\n* The reaction to the cut was relatively muted, with Brent up only ~1.5%. Tbf, some of that increase had come in earlier in the week as the move was highly telegraphed. But, still, while Brent is back up above $90/bbl, there are virtually no analysts that are projecting it to increase beyond $100/bbl  in the current quarter, mostly because of China's economic issues. \n\n* The Urals discount has sort of stabilised around 22%. However, volumes have fallen sharply over the past few weeks. There have been rumors that large Indian and Chinese state-owned O&G companies have been purchasing Russian oil for $60-65/bbl. But, at the end of the day, that's not good enough for Russia especially as volumes drop simultaneously. \n\n* Meanwhile, Russia is buying up really old tankers to try to get ahead of the December EU ban/price-cap on Russian oil. The fact that they're buying tankers that were headed for, or already at, scrapyards at record pace is at least some evidence that the Kremlin, while talking a big game, is expecting the price-cap to come in place. \n\n* German 1-month forward baseload prices seem to have stabilised under \u20ac400/MWh.

The transmission mechanism for both cuts, as well as hikes, from OPEC only seems to work haphazardly ever since the oil price crash in 2014. </p></li>\n<li><p>U.S. production continues to soar and new production from Guyana and Brazil is also ramping up. The U.S. itself could probably increase its output by 1mmbpd starting next year according to the EIA. </p></li>\n<li><p>The reaction to the cut was relatively muted, with Brent up only ~1.5%. Tbf, some of that increase had come in earlier in the week as the move was highly telegraphed. But, still, while Brent is back up above $90/bbl, there are virtually no analysts that are projecting it to increase beyond $100/bbl  in the current quarter, mostly because of China&#39;s economic issues. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Urals discount has sort of stabilised around 22%. However, volumes have fallen sharply over the past few weeks. There have been rumors that large Indian and Chinese state-owned O&amp;G companies have been purchasing Russian oil for $60-65/bbl. But, at the end of the day, that&#39;s not good enough for Russia especially as volumes drop simultaneously. </p></li>\n<li><p>Meanwhile, Russia is buying up really old tankers to try to get ahead of the December EU ban/price-cap on Russian oil. The fact that they&#39;re buying tankers that were headed for, or already at, scrapyards at record pace is at least some evidence that the Kremlin, while talking a big game, is expecting the price-cap to come in place. </p></li>\n<li><p>German 1-month forward baseload prices seem to have stabilised under \u20ac400/MWh. The Dutch physical forward price of natural gas (the benchmark for Europe) is down 43% from around a month ago, but is still up ~7 fold from its average.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

If it fails, the Germans are bound to move in much more dangerous directions; in the long run even toward some partly clandestine arrangement with the French or, if this should not work, toward an independent nuclear effort in Germany -- not now but in time.\u201d Pessimistically, Kennedy wrote that \u201cI see no other course for the Germans if the MLF fails. All of our experience with them, after both wars, makes it clear that they will not accept a permanently and passively subordinate status in arms.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2018-02-02/german-nuclear-question-nonproliferation-treaty\">https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2018-02-02/german-nuclear-question-nonproliferation-treaty</a></p>\n</div>",

They got through residential buildings and the school building, two people were injured.\nOn the night of October 4-5, the city of Bila Tserkva in the Kiev region was attacked by barrage ordnance \"Geran-2\" (Shahed-136), a fire broke out at the industrial facility.\n\n>There was a video with the first mobilized prisoner who received a summons for conscription to the military registration and enlistment office on September 21, and on September 25 without any training he was on the front line in the 15th motorized rifle brigade of the Central Military District.\n\n>He reports that he studied the information on how to surrender correctly and contacted the project \"I want to live\" organized by the Ukrainian government. Once near Svatovo, he surrendered.\n\n>This is consistent with the data of the Dozhd TV channel, which reported on the first mobilized, sent without preparation to Svatovo on September 25.\n\n>The pro-Russian telegram channel \"VChK OGPU\" tells about the training of those mobilized in the Saratov region. They were placed in a temporary point near Volsk, where they work out ambushes on civilian cars along the roads. This is reported from local residents. Perhaps in this way the mobilized are being prepared to organize ambushes on Ukrainian supply columns.\n\n>BRDM-2MS armored vehicles (long written off from the Russian army and remained in service only with the troops of the National Guard), which we have seen on trains for a long time, enter the training grounds to train the mobilized.\n\n>After clarifying the data, our team is inclined to believe that the Russian Defense Ministry could indeed recruit 200 thousand people during the first stage of mobilization, but we do not yet see sufficient evidence.\n\n>We also clarify that the current situation is incorrect to call \"full mobilization\" because this term implies a number of factors, such as economic mobilization or martial law, which are not currently available. Therefore, let's call it \"quasi-partial mobilization.\"\n\n>Assessing the likelihood of Russia's use of nuclear weapons, our team admits that before statements from Western officials appear, we will see \"plums\" of these intelligence in some Western media.\n\n>There was a video of a train with equipment belonging to the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, which is responsible for nuclear weapons. This video is geolocated in Sergiev Posad, and the train is moving north (not towards the border with Ukraine).\n\n>We believe that there are no nuclear weapons in this train, because special cars are used for its transportation, which are not visible in the video. Perhaps it is a nuclear weapons protection company going to the exercises.\n\n>The representative of the Pentagon officially answered reporters a question about this movement of equipment that Washington does not yet see any cause for concern.\n\n>Elon Musk's reaction could well have been caused by ongoing attempts by Russia to intimidate Europe and America.\n\n>Correspondents of the BBC Russian Service report that special forces of 3 special forces brigades from Togliatti died during the retreat from Liman. Nine deaths (including several officers) and one seriously wounded are known. Relatives of the victims said that it seems that this special forces unit was thrown at organizing a rearguard battle to ensure the departure of the main forces from Liman. This is a great loss for the Russian special forces, which could have been avoided by organizing the retreat of the Russian Armed Forces from the Estuary in advance.\n\n>The article also notes that the Russian media almost never report operations involving special forces of the Main Directorate of the General Staff (former GRU special forces). Sometimes their victories become known after the fact, but defeats are always attributed to volunteers, separatists or mobilized.\n\n>A similar situation was in the retreat from Kharkiv region. Then the Russian media reported that on the front line there were mobilized from the \"LPR\" and Russian Guards from Bashkortostan and Samara. A few days later, it turned out that Marines from the Kaliningrad region were also captured.\n\n>In July, we described the story of how a Russian with Estonian citizenship tried to buy and take quadcopters for the Russian military from Estonia, but was detained. Now the Estonian Security Police Department has handed over these drones to the Ukrainian army.\n\n>Details of the explosion of the MiG-31 aircraft at the airfield in Belbek on October 1 appeared. He crashed not during landing, but during takeoff (with full ammunition and full refueling). The navigator managed to eject, the pilot died.\n\n>T-90S tanks of export modification, which we asked to help geolocate in the report of September 16, were found on the front line.\n\n>Denis Pushilin awarded Ramzan Kadyrov with the star of the Hero of the DPR.\n\n>A Russian citizen was killed in the crash of a Malian Su-25 plane. It is known that Wagner's group has been operating in this region for a long time.\n\n\nPerhaps the most encouraging CIT report for Ukraine so far? Look at the lines established. The Estonian drone thing is kinda funny but what\u2019s telling is the Svatove situation. Again begs the question, where the hell is the actual army?\n\n[Here\u2019s a UA map for your reference. ](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1gO8X7RC8cUzc-1q7-s4-09X53HNIEJA&ll=46.25818681657935%2C32.80004078982745&z=8)May not agree exactly with CIT but should be close.\n\nAs I typed this, UA Weapons reported another T-62M captured \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMeanwhile Putin signed a decree that all all objects on Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant should become Russian property.

Once near Svatovo, he surrendered.</p>\n\n<p>This is consistent with the data of the Dozhd TV channel, which reported on the first mobilized, sent without preparation to Svatovo on September 25.</p>\n\n<p>The pro-Russian telegram channel &quot;VChK OGPU&quot; tells about the training of those mobilized in the Saratov region. They were placed in a temporary point near Volsk, where they work out ambushes on civilian cars along the roads. This is reported from local residents. Perhaps in this way the mobilized are being prepared to organize ambushes on Ukrainian supply columns.</p>\n\n<p>BRDM-2MS armored vehicles (long written off from the Russian army and remained in service only with the troops of the National Guard), which we have seen on trains for a long time, enter the training grounds to train the mobilized.</p>\n\n<p>After clarifying the data, our team is inclined to believe that the Russian Defense Ministry could indeed recruit 200 thousand people during the first stage of mobilization, but we do not yet see sufficient evidence.</p>\n\n<p>We also clarify that the current situation is incorrect to call &quot;full mobilization&quot; because this term implies a number of factors, such as economic mobilization or martial law, which are not currently available. Therefore, let&#39;s call it &quot;quasi-partial mobilization.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Assessing the likelihood of Russia&#39;s use of nuclear weapons, our team admits that before statements from Western officials appear, we will see &quot;plums&quot; of these intelligence in some Western media.</p>\n\n<p>There was a video of a train with equipment belonging to the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, which is responsible for nuclear weapons. This video is geolocated in Sergiev Posad, and the train is moving north (not towards the border with Ukraine).</p>\n\n<p>We believe that there are no nuclear weapons in this train, because special cars are used for its transportation, which are not visible in the video. Perhaps it is a nuclear weapons protection company going to the exercises.</p>\n\n<p>The representative of the Pentagon officially answered reporters a question about this movement of equipment that Washington does not yet see any cause for concern.</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk&#39;s reaction could well have been caused by ongoing attempts by Russia to intimidate Europe and America.</p>\n\n<p>Correspondents of the BBC Russian Service report that special forces of 3 special forces brigades from Togliatti died during the retreat from Liman. Nine deaths (including several officers) and one seriously wounded are known. Relatives of the victims said that it seems that this special forces unit was thrown at organizing a rearguard battle to ensure the departure of the main forces from Liman. This is a great loss for the Russian special forces, which could have been avoided by organizing the retreat of the Russian Armed Forces from the Estuary in advance.</p>\n\n<p>The article also notes that the Russian media almost never report operations involving special forces of the Main Directorate of the General Staff (former GRU special forces). Sometimes their victories become known after the fact, but defeats are always attributed to volunteers, separatists or mobilized.</p>\n\n<p>A similar situation was in the retreat from Kharkiv region. Then the Russian media reported that on the front line there were mobilized from the &quot;LPR&quot; and Russian Guards from Bashkortostan and Samara. A few days later, it turned out that Marines from the Kaliningrad region were also captured.</p>\n\n<p>In July, we described the story of how a Russian with Estonian citizenship tried to buy and take quadcopters for the Russian military from Estonia, but was detained. Now the Estonian Security Police Department has handed over these drones to the Ukrainian army.</p>\n\n<p>Details of the explosion of the MiG-31 aircraft at the airfield in Belbek on October 1 appeared. He crashed not during landing, but during takeoff (with full ammunition and full refueling). The navigator managed to eject, the pilot died.</p>\n\n<p>T-90S tanks of export modification, which we asked to help geolocate in the report of September 16, were found on the front line.</p>\n\n<p>Denis Pushilin awarded Ramzan Kadyrov with the star of the Hero of the DPR.</p>\n\n<p>A Russian citizen was killed in the crash of a Malian Su-25 plane. It is known that Wagner&#39;s group has been operating in this region for a long time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most encouraging CIT report for Ukraine so far? Look at the lines established. The Estonian drone thing is kinda funny but what\u2019s telling is the Svatove situation. Again begs the question, where the hell is the actual army?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1gO8X7RC8cUzc-1q7-s4-09X53HNIEJA&amp;ll=46.25818681657935%2C32.80004078982745&amp;z=8\">Here\u2019s a UA map for your reference. </a>May not agree exactly with CIT but should be close.</p>\n\n<p>As I typed this, UA Weapons reported another T-62M captured \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile Putin signed a decree that all all objects on Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant should become Russian property.

If the UA front line takes Novoraisk, for example, artillery will probably stay north of that position. Thus the line needs to be *closer* to the intended target than the range of the guns.

        "body": "[CITeam released a special report on mobilisation.](https://notes.citeam.org/mobilization-oct-4-5) Wasn\u2019t fitting in my previous comment. Some funnies in here. \n\n>Volunteer summary on mobilization in the Russian Federation for October 4-5\n\n>\"Important Stories\" and CIT conducted a study on which regions most men were mobilized for the war, and estimated that Russia plans to mobilize 213,000 people from 53 regions. And the publication \"Verstka\" with reference to information received from sources, reports that the regional authorities instructed military registration and enlistment offices to mobilize 2-4 times more men than stated by the Ministry of Defense.\n\n\n>President Putin said that he had issued a decree amending the category of appeal during mobilization. Thus, in addition to full-time students, the decree on which was signed on September 24, evening students and graduate students will receive a deferral. And the State Duma today clarified the provisions of the bill on the introduction of a tax on those who did not serve in the army.\n\n\n>Moscow Mayor Sobyanin signed a decree on additional measures to support the families of the mobilized, including one-time material assistance for all family members. And the families of mobilized residents of the Kaluga region were exempted from payment for kindergartens.\n\n\n>The military commissar from St. Petersburg shares his understanding of the terms \"military experience\" and \"combat experience\". He proposes to equate the military department with military experience, because, according to him, theoretical knowledge, which is accumulated on training, is then fixed at military training. And the vice-governors of St. Petersburg were instructed to organize mobilization among state employees.\n\n\n>The authorities of the Republic of Mari El, the share of mobilized in which, according to the calculations of \"Important Stories\" is 1.26 times larger than the all-Russian one, announced the fulfillment of the task of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the first stage of partial mobilization. It should be noted that of the 1,700 planned for mobilization by the time of the first reports of its completion, 900 were called up.\n\n\n>Despite the fact that the governor of the Novosibirsk region announced the completion of the first stage of mobilization, in fact, mobilization in the region continues. Novosibirsk enterprise \"Katod\", which also produces night vision devices, received an order from the military registration and enlistment office to provide 60 people for mobilization. Residents of Buryatia continue to receive subpoenas, despite the end of mobilization announced by the head of the republic. Governor of the Kursk region Roman Starovoit also reported that \"partial mobilization and formation of territorial defense units\" are coming to an end in the region. In addition, he visited the places of gathering and gathering of mobilized Kurians in the Vladimir region. At the same time, Starovoit described the state of a number of military units he visited as \"just horror.\" The governor of the Vladimir region, who made up the company of Starovoit, was forced to agree with his colleague. He admitted that the training center for the mobilized was overcrowded and poorly equipped and promised to solve the problems soon.\n\n\n>In Russia, the first criminal case has been initiated for evading partial mobilization. According to lawyer Pavel Chikov, a case was initiated against a 32-year-old resident of Penza under Article 328 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Now the issue of initiating a similar criminal case in Moscow is being resolved.\n\n\n>Yesterday we reported a video message from those mobilized from Omsk who demanded one-time payments. Today, the governor of the Omsk region Alexander Burkov said that the region has no money to pay mobilized citizens, because \"the budget deficit in the Omsk region is more than 13 billion rubles.\"\n\n\n>On October 4, another train with mobilized ones left Krasnoyarsk station: 16 cars of 54 shelves each. And those mobilized from Blagoveshchensk have to get to the educational part at their own expense.\n\n\n>In the village of Molkino, Krasnodar Krai, the mobilized are being trained. They are trained at BRDM-2MS. Mobilized from the Rostov region arrived in Donetsk and are trained at a local test site. In the next video of the so-called The \"People's Militia of the DPR\" claims that the mobilized are already undergoing combat coherence at the ranges of the Kherson region. How this relates to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation on the training of mobilized Russians \"in the rear areas of the SVO\" is not explained. There was the first confirmed report of a mobilized prisoner. The Ukrainian channel \"I want to live\" published a recording with 26-year-old Mikhail Kulikov from Orsk, called up on September 21. The publication \"Bedger\" verified his identity.\n\n\n>There was another news of the deceased mobilized. In Penza, during training sessions at the training ground, a 41-year-old man had a heart attack.\n\n\n>Pets also suffer from mobilization: many people mobilized or leaving the country simply have no one to leave their pets because of mobilization. Read more about this in the Medusa material.\n\n\n>The head of the Krasnoarmeysky district of Kuban Yuri Vasin forces his subordinates to \"voluntarily\" give their daily earnings to the fund to help the mobilized. And the employees of the Chelyabinsk Regional Children's Library named after V. Mayakovsky was given two sleeping bags and library cards - amulets to the mobilized. In Mari El, as the Rain TV channel found out, businessmen are forced to donate up to 1% of profits for mobilization, blackmailing them with \"armor\" for employees.\n\n\n>At the same time, the mobilized demonstrate bulletproof vests, which are small to absolutely everyone.\n\n\n>A summons were sent to Dmitry Klyukvin, blind from birth, in Moscow. He intends to come to the military registration and enlistment office with a white cane with which he moves around the city. In Magadan, 44-year-old Alexei Sheshenin was sent to war with a cancer in remission. A military registration specialty was changed in the military registration office for a bilized from Krasnodar Krai, who had not previously served and did not have military training. Khabarovsk mobilized the appeal of the 41-year-old father of two children Pavel Starodub, which does not fit the voiced parameters, and does not want to return him home. Ruslan Sapegin, a resident of the Volgograd region, with a hernia, osteochondrosis, angina and hypertension, was sent to war by the commander of an infantry platoon. The Baymak Military Registration and enlistment Office in Buryatia called on the 40-year-old father of four children. In St. Petersburg, the police and an employee of the military registration and enlistment office applied directly to public hearings in the Vladimir district. They issued summons to the 50-year-old head of the municipality Denis Tikhonenko, as well as to the 40-year-old previously unserved deputy Dmitry Prytkov.\n\n\n>Residents of Serpukhov complain about the mobilized, who drink, litter and brawl without interruption. \"It's scary to let children out,\" said a local resident. And in the Karelian village of Sheltozero, according to Baza, they could not mobilize anyone, because local men, resorting to the experience of previous generations, \"went to the forests for cranberries.\"\n\n\n>Medusa found that the residents of Dagestan have a special legitimate opportunity to avoid participation in the war with Ukraine - an alternative service for indigenous peoples. And the governor of the aimag (region) of Gov-Altai of Mongolia invited Buryats, Oirats, Kalmyks and Tuvans who fled from Russia. He promised to provide them with free housing for one month and help them learn Mongolian. Pavel Chikov reports that cars left by Russians who left for Georgia near the border are evacuated to a fine parking lot.\n\n\n>Since the beginning of the \"partial\" mobilization in Russia, the demand for cash has increased dramatically, which has led to a significant outflow of money from banks.\n\n\n>On the morning of October 5, employees of Rosgvardia cordoned off the military commissariat in the Oktyabrsky district of Ulan-Ude. According to Baikal-Daily, there was a message with threats of explosion. Personnel and civilians were evacuated, no dangerous devices and objects were found during the inspection. In the Moscow region, an unknown person tried to set fire to a non-residential barracks on the territory of a military unit in the village of Zyuzino. Today it became known that in Krasnodar on the night of September 25, they tried to set fire to the military registration and enlistment office, but the arsonist was scared away by Cossacks and police officers. In Kazan, a schoolgirl who threw \"Molotov cocktails\" at the military registration and enlistment office was arrested. She was placed under house arrest until December 3.\n\n\n>VKontakte launched a petition in support of the purchase of equipment for soldiers of the Russian army instead of New Year's jewelry in Voronezh, which at the time of publication of the report had collected more than 500,000 signatures. And in Kaluga, the mayor himself decided not to spend money on the Christmas tree, but to send them to the war.\n\n\nAnd [don\u2019t forget the sheep](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/09/30/7369797/index.amp) distributed to families of conscripted in Tuva.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://notes.citeam.org/mobilization-oct-4-5\">CITeam released a special report on mobilisation.</a> Wasn\u2019t fitting in my previous comment. Some funnies in here. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Volunteer summary on mobilization in the Russian Federation for October 4-5</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Important Stories&quot; and CIT conducted a study on which regions most men were mobilized for the war, and estimated that Russia plans to mobilize 213,000 people from 53 regions. And the publication &quot;Verstka&quot; with reference to information received from sources, reports that the regional authorities instructed military registration and enlistment offices to mobilize 2-4 times more men than stated by the Ministry of Defense.</p>\n\n<p>President Putin said that he had issued a decree amending the category of appeal during mobilization. Thus, in addition to full-time students, the decree on which was signed on September 24, evening students and graduate students will receive a deferral. And the State Duma today clarified the provisions of the bill on the introduction of a tax on those who did not serve in the army.</p>\n\n<p>Moscow Mayor Sobyanin signed a decree on additional measures to support the families of the mobilized, including one-time material assistance for all family members. And the families of mobilized residents of the Kaluga region were exempted from payment for kindergartens.</p>\n\n<p>The military commissar from St. Petersburg shares his understanding of the terms &quot;military experience&quot; and &quot;combat experience&quot;. He proposes to equate the military department with military experience, because, according to him, theoretical knowledge, which is accumulated on training, is then fixed at military training. And the vice-governors of St. Petersburg were instructed to organize mobilization among state employees.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities of the Republic of Mari El, the share of mobilized in which, according to the calculations of &quot;Important Stories&quot; is 1.26 times larger than the all-Russian one, announced the fulfillment of the task of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the first stage of partial mobilization. It should be noted that of the 1,700 planned for mobilization by the time of the first reports of its completion, 900 were called up.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that the governor of the Novosibirsk region announced the completion of the first stage of mobilization, in fact, mobilization in the region continues. Novosibirsk enterprise &quot;Katod&quot;, which also produces night vision devices, received an order from the military registration and enlistment office to provide 60 people for mobilization. Residents of Buryatia continue to receive subpoenas, despite the end of mobilization announced by the head of the republic. Governor of the Kursk region Roman Starovoit also reported that &quot;partial mobilization and formation of territorial defense units&quot; are coming to an end in the region. In addition, he visited the places of gathering and gathering of mobilized Kurians in the Vladimir region. At the same time, Starovoit described the state of a number of military units he visited as &quot;just horror.&quot; The governor of the Vladimir region, who made up the company of Starovoit, was forced to agree with his colleague. He admitted that the training center for the mobilized was overcrowded and poorly equipped and promised to solve the problems soon.</p>\n\n<p>In Russia, the first criminal case has been initiated for evading partial mobilization. According to lawyer Pavel Chikov, a case was initiated against a 32-year-old resident of Penza under Article 328 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Now the issue of initiating a similar criminal case in Moscow is being resolved.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday we reported a video message from those mobilized from Omsk who demanded one-time payments. Today, the governor of the Omsk region Alexander Burkov said that the region has no money to pay mobilized citizens, because &quot;the budget deficit in the Omsk region is more than 13 billion rubles.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>On October 4, another train with mobilized ones left Krasnoyarsk station: 16 cars of 54 shelves each. And those mobilized from Blagoveshchensk have to get to the educational part at their own expense.</p>\n\n<p>In the village of Molkino, Krasnodar Krai, the mobilized are being trained. They are trained at BRDM-2MS. Mobilized from the Rostov region arrived in Donetsk and are trained at a local test site. In the next video of the so-called The &quot;People&#39;s Militia of the DPR&quot; claims that the mobilized are already undergoing combat coherence at the ranges of the Kherson region. How this relates to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation on the training of mobilized Russians &quot;in the rear areas of the SVO&quot; is not explained.

            "body": "During the World Wars and after, the US draft was more or less popular. At least until the Vietnam war, which is a whole other subject. \n\nIn WWI most of the burden was shifted from Federal agents to state and county draft boards. This was a lesson of the Civil War, when draft agents had provoked a number of very bad riots trying to fill their quotas. Better to let community members decide for themselves than to try and apply some blanket standard. Shared complicity and all. Men would generally report to the local draft board and be evaluated by county officials, who would put them into categories and assign them a # and a card. Then the War Department would fill its quota by drawing at random from the list passed along up the draft board chain. \n\nThis system worked well enough to fill the manpower needs, but then American casualties remained light and the draft never really had to scrape the barrel of manpower or get into the hard questions surrounding the draft boards 'supervised decentralization.' The reality was local draft boards had *considerable* influence over who would be put into the highest, most likely to be drafted, categories. The hated Civil War practice of submitting substitutes was gone. But if you were friends with a local somebody, or especially a judge (most federal judges oversaw state level draft boards) you could find an excuse to be placed in a lower (or higher, if thats what you wanted) category. Minorities also struggled with the system. As you might expect, a powerful and decentralized draft system was.... awkward in the Jim Crow south. Many southern draft boards were actually divided on what to do about African Americans in their communities. Some felt that service was a noble obligation, to vindicate citizenship. And so often those communities ranked blacks *lower* to keep them out of the Army. Others saw service as a burden to best be avoided, and so ranked blacks *higher* to keep their white sons out of the Army. Awkward. But it wasn't just racial minorities, as important were ethnic and religious minorities. German descendants were often forced to prove their loyalty by registering for the draft, if they werent forced to volunteer outright. Non-compliance invited mob violence. Religious minorities were equally the victims of mob violence, several Quakers were forced by crowds and by local draft boards to register. And at that time the Army made no real distinction between draftees and would not assign, say, a drafted Quaker to a non-combat role. The intervention of the US Supreme Court forced both draft boards and the Army to implement policies for conscientious (read: religious, those dirty socialists didnt count) objectors. In regards to mob violence, in New York City groups of parents and pro-war activists actually spent weeks organizing vigilante groups to force people to report for the draft, or to volunteer for service. It was an odd phenomenon. Groups, sometimes armed with sticks and clubs, would wait by mass transit stops and demand every man who came out show them their draft card. If you didnt have a card on you, down to the recruiter youd go. Even if you had registered, or even had already enlisted, and just happened to not have documentation with you that day. Several men were actually charged with bounty jumping and sent to trial because of these mobs, though I believe they got off. \n\nSo while the World War One system *worked* it didnt work well and it certainly produced a kind of chaos. By World War Two the draft boards were more centrally managed, and were given very objective criteria to weight for categorization purposes. This had the effect of reducing the silliness around who got drafted. Moreover the US put out a much more general call for manpower, and so it was overall much harder to avoid registering and serving. Nevertheless in the last years of the War there were draft riots around racial disparities in service and treatment within the Army. But when the draft came back for Korea, most complaints with it had faded. It was seen as a necessary obligation. Older men had gone, now the younger generations had to as well. And the ask was much lower, IIRC between 1955 and 1965 the draft only took an average of about 100k men a year, which isnt much. Service was also likely to be very pleasant, with most draftees ending up in Germany. I dont think anyone must have *liked* being drafted, if you wanted to serve you could still volunteer, but I could think of worse things to do than shooting guns and farting around with some tanks in Bavaria. Of course a lot of the issues which would come up during the Vietnam War were present in both the WWII and Cold War drafts. For example college deferment, and remember college enrollment SKYROCKETED in the 1950s, was a class-based exemption. Poor Americans often didn't go, while upper class men went disproportionately. Moreover, many blacks served disproportionately as enlisted men (in Vietnam over 90% of officers were white) and disproportionately in support roles. So not as tankers, but as cooks, clerks, supply officers, truck drivers. So while Elvis was sitting on the range plinking targets having a good time, black draftees were likely doing the backbreaking work of moving ammunition out of depots for forward units to use. And of course, while the 1950s was well before the era of the 'Army as job training' advertising campaigns, there is obviously a lot of crossover between being, say, a mechanic and being a gofer. Black soldiers were also less likely to go to skilled jobs, and thus less likely to see any post-service benefit from their time overseas. Last as one black soldier said in his trial in 1970, German women often refused to even LOOK at them, while they \"went to dances\" with the white soldiers!",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>During the World Wars and after, the US draft was more or less popular. At least until the Vietnam war, which is a whole other subject. </p>\n\n<p>In WWI most of the burden was shifted from Federal agents to state and county draft boards. This was a lesson of the Civil War, when draft agents had provoked a number of very bad riots trying to fill their quotas. Better to let community members decide for themselves than to try and apply some blanket standard. Shared complicity and all. Men would generally report to the local draft board and be evaluated by county officials, who would put them into categories and assign them a # and a card. Then the War Department would fill its quota by drawing at random from the list passed along up the draft board chain. </p>\n\n<p>This system worked well enough to fill the manpower needs, but then American casualties remained light and the draft never really had to scrape the barrel of manpower or get into the hard questions surrounding the draft boards &#39;supervised decentralization.&#39; The reality was local draft boards had <em>considerable</em> influence over who would be put into the highest, most likely to be drafted, categories. The hated Civil War practice of submitting substitutes was gone. But if you were friends with a local somebody, or especially a judge (most federal judges oversaw state level draft boards) you could find an excuse to be placed in a lower (or higher, if thats what you wanted) category. Minorities also struggled with the system. As you might expect, a powerful and decentralized draft system was.... awkward in the Jim Crow south. Many southern draft boards were actually divided on what to do about African Americans in their communities. Some felt that service was a noble obligation, to vindicate citizenship. And so often those communities ranked blacks <em>lower</em> to keep them out of the Army. Others saw service as a burden to best be avoided, and so ranked blacks <em>higher</em> to keep their white sons out of the Army. Awkward. But it wasn&#39;t just racial minorities, as important were ethnic and religious minorities. German descendants were often forced to prove their loyalty by registering for the draft, if they werent forced to volunteer outright. Non-compliance invited mob violence. Religious minorities were equally the victims of mob violence, several Quakers were forced by crowds and by local draft boards to register. And at that time the Army made no real distinction between draftees and would not assign, say, a drafted Quaker to a non-combat role. The intervention of the US Supreme Court forced both draft boards and the Army to implement policies for conscientious (read: religious, those dirty socialists didnt count) objectors. In regards to mob violence, in New York City groups of parents and pro-war activists actually spent weeks organizing vigilante groups to force people to report for the draft, or to volunteer for service. It was an odd phenomenon. Groups, sometimes armed with sticks and clubs, would wait by mass transit stops and demand every man who came out show them their draft card. If you didnt have a card on you, down to the recruiter youd go. Even if you had registered, or even had already enlisted, and just happened to not have documentation with you that day. Several men were actually charged with bounty jumping and sent to trial because of these mobs, though I believe they got off. </p>\n\n<p>So while the World War One system <em>worked</em> it didnt work well and it certainly produced a kind of chaos. By World War Two the draft boards were more centrally managed, and were given very objective criteria to weight for categorization purposes. This had the effect of reducing the silliness around who got drafted. Moreover the US put out a much more general call for manpower, and so it was overall much harder to avoid registering and serving. Nevertheless in the last years of the War there were draft riots around racial disparities in service and treatment within the Army. But when the draft came back for Korea, most complaints with it had faded. It was seen as a necessary obligation. Older men had gone, now the younger generations had to as well. And the ask was much lower, IIRC between 1955 and 1965 the draft only took an average of about 100k men a year, which isnt much. Service was also likely to be very pleasant, with most draftees ending up in Germany. I dont think anyone must have <em>liked</em> being drafted, if you wanted to serve you could still volunteer, but I could think of worse things to do than shooting guns and farting around with some tanks in Bavaria. Of course a lot of the issues which would come up during the Vietnam War were present in both the WWII and Cold War drafts. For example college deferment, and remember college enrollment SKYROCKETED in the 1950s, was a class-based exemption. Poor Americans often didn&#39;t go, while upper class men went disproportionately. Moreover, many blacks served disproportionately as enlisted men (in Vietnam over 90% of officers were white) and disproportionately in support roles. So not as tankers, but as cooks, clerks, supply officers, truck drivers. So while Elvis was sitting on the range plinking targets having a good time, black draftees were likely doing the backbreaking work of moving ammunition out of depots for forward units to use. And of course, while the 1950s was well before the era of the &#39;Army as job training&#39; advertising campaigns, there is obviously a lot of crossover between being, say, a mechanic and being a gofer. Black soldiers were also less likely to go to skilled jobs, and thus less likely to see any post-service benefit from their time overseas. Last as one black soldier said in his trial in 1970, German women often refused to even LOOK at them, while they &quot;went to dances&quot; with the white soldiers!</p>\n</div>",

I've had students in class when discussing certain conflicts try to dunk on me because they can tell me the penetration statistics for the T-34 or can regurgitate a line about the Sherman tank from a book they didn't even read. Youtube and twitter 'analysis' play into it, and if you read somewhat deeply into certain areas you can just tell what book many of these Youtubers are reading out of. \n\nThere are two issues at play I think. First there is, in the life of every military nerd, a dark dawning realization. You get into it because you want to read about cool battles. But at some point most people realize that cool battles and fun war stories arnt the full picture, and that in many cases the battle is only one part of a much bigger context. Understanding why one side won means thinking about things beyond the battlefield. But thats hard, hence the second issue: memorizing and debating stats is cut, dry, and easy. I can look up the T-34s penetration and armor statistics on Wikipedia. We can compare this apples to apples with the Panzer 4. This gives everyone firm, objective ground to stand on and a clear causal explanation for results. For many people, especially those who dont have the time and inclination to get into issues more deeply, thats enough. That satisfices the second order twitch in the back of their brain. \n\nBut of course its not enough. Everyone loves to quote the maxim, but nobody ever thinks about what Carl von Clausewitz meant when he discussed the linkage between war and politics. War, politics, and society all feed into one another. There is no way you can understand a war unless you understand the politics behind it, and no way to understand the politics, the armies, the men, or any of the rest of it unless you understand the society that spawned them. And then you really have to look at armies themselves as little miniature societies, with their own hierarchies (not always based on rank) cultures, sub institutions, and competing interests. Most academics will spend their lives trying to unravel these issues, and then typically only for one place and in one time. Its not really something that reads well on a page, and certainly not something that makes for big clicks on youtube. Plus it doesnt help you get better at World of Tanks.

Cover from air strikes is provided by air defense systems in the Liman 1 area. \u25aa\ufe0fIn the Petropavlovsk sector, the shock groups of the 14th and 92nd Ombre of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue their attempts to reach the Kislovka-Orlyanka line. On the evening of October 5, tank units of the RF Armed Forces engaged the enemy in the area of Stepovaya Novoselovka. During the clash, the Ukrainian infantry suffered losses and retreated to Petropavlovka. Despite the failure, the command of the brigade set the task of taking Kislovka in the next day. To this end, a sabotage and reconnaissance group of foreign mercenaries and members of special forces units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, up to 20 people, is being formed in the Petropavlovka area. \ud83d\udd3bAt the Kremennaya sector, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are finishing their regrouping for the offensive on Kremennaya and Svatovo. \u25aa\ufe0fUp to 200 mobilized citizens have been deployed in the vicinity of Torsky. In areas east of Makiivka and south of Ploshchanka, Ukrainian DRGs are operating, probing the defenses of the RF Armed Forces. Over the past two days, Ukrainian artillery has been trying to establish fire control over the Kremennaya-Svatovo highway. Target designation is provided by reconnaissance UAVs equipped with a projectile drop device. \u25aa\ufe0fThe backbone of the offensive grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is made up of units of the 25th separate airborne brigade. Management and coordination of actions both in the Svatovsky and Kremenny sections is carried out from the command post in Liman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/1JzXzt4.jpg\">Map</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1577948191693078529\">Kherson Cat</a> reports that Russians are now disassembling the barge bridge next to Antonovsky bridge. </p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>Also tomorrow is Putin\u2019s birthday.

Currently, the fighting continues. \u25aa\ufe0fUkrainian formations are actively using UAVs on the Aleksandrovsky sector of the front.

We also know that after Lysychansk there was an \"operational pause\" during much of July and August, until the start of the Ukrainian offensives in the beginning of September. So, an overwhelming majority of these losses in July/Augst were probably from the April-June period you're looking at.

The Izyum axis was still attacking in mid July, and there was a large coup de main attempt early on to breakthrough the Siversk-Bakhmut line. The Donetsk sector attacks against Avdiivka-Pisky-Mariinka started in late July too. And attacks on the Siversk-Bakhmut line began in earnest by late July as well. An operational pause definitely really exist at all (Kofman had said the same), it definitely didn&#39;t last two months into September. </p>\n\n<p>Out of all of those, Russians were making tiny advances but it wasn&#39;t a bloodless fight for the Ukrainians, especially at Pisky, where even the units involved (not TDF) were complaining online about their heavy casualties and some personnel even making videos calling out the UAF leadership for abandoning them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, an overwhelming majority of these losses in July/Augst were probably from the April-June period you&#39;re looking at.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>July-August period would include not only the above-mentioned Russian operations but from the UAF perspective that represented the tail end of the May-July Kherson counteroffensive, as well as the &quot;see-saw&quot; operations in Kharkiv, where the Russians and UAF were both counterattacking each other, plus the Izyum counterattack in early August done by the 93rd Brigade. </p>\n\n<p>To add to previous Russian offensive ops in August, the Kherson bridgehead spoiling attack that started on August 20 that did see some success taking ground.</p>\n\n<p>All told, the UAF were HEAVILY committed from May-August, that was the bloodiest period of the war for them, and yet their Oryx reported losses are very low.

Those publications have had numerous scandals with reporters over the years, but does it diminish the work they do? Credibility is transactional and perception.

Air-Ground joint operations between the US Army and USAF tactical aviation have been doctrine, carved in stone, since the early 80s and even before that USAF requirements to provide CAS was actually made law in the Key West Agreement. \n\nPrecision fires from strike aircraft weren't even possible when AirLand Battle was created, only a very limited number of aircraft could deliver them at the time (which was true all the way into Operation Desert Storm, where a whopping 3x type of aircraft could drop laser guided bombs). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And the USAF will assume that theyll be able to bust through, because a core component of their post-Vietnam and modern identity is based on the idea that the USAF will win the air battle and get strike aircraft through.\n\nThat's because the corps function of the USAF is to do just that, they're not designed or intended to provide CAS for ground forces, that's a secondary role they have only recently become only somewhat happy doing. They do strategic bombing, that's what Air Power means, it comes down to not even needing ground forces because Air Power wins the wars alone. They tried that in WW2, Korea, and Vietnam with bombing, they tried it during the Air Campaign in ODS, they tried in 1999 against Serbia. Every time they failed, then every time they decided afterwards that new technological advances would allow them to succeed the next time where they failed the last. \n\nHowever, to perform that mission requires them to get through enemy integrated air defenses, which is their specialty at this point. Everyone is so surprised by how poorly the Russian VKS is performing, but that is because they can't get through the Ukrainian IADS, which isn't even a very impressive one. Why can't the VKS not get through it? Because they suck at SEAD/DEAD. Whereas the USAF wrote the book on those missions. \n\nSo if the USAF can suppress or destroy enemy air defenses to perform strategic strikes (deep rear area) they can also perform tactical support, which again is a requirement per the 1948 Key West Agreement. \n\nBut tactical air support doesn't just mean CAS (which they are legally required to perform), it also means deep air support/air interdiction (arguably more important than CAS) as well as air reconnaissance, not to mention air superiority over the front lines so enemy air doesn't attack our ground troops. \n\nWhich is where the imbalance really is. Not in providing fires but in protection, the US Army never neglected organic fires equipment, training, and doctrine, but we did ignore air defense because we were sure the USAF could protect the skies. And that is still true for most enemy aircraft, except UAVs, which aircraft and even standard radars have a very hard time finding.

Air-Ground joint operations between the US Army and USAF tactical aviation have been doctrine, carved in stone, since the early 80s and even before that USAF requirements to provide CAS was actually made law in the Key West Agreement. </p>\n\n<p>Precision fires from strike aircraft weren&#39;t even possible when AirLand Battle was created, only a very limited number of aircraft could deliver them at the time (which was true all the way into Operation Desert Storm, where a whopping 3x type of aircraft could drop laser guided bombs). </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the USAF will assume that theyll be able to bust through, because a core component of their post-Vietnam and modern identity is based on the idea that the USAF will win the air battle and get strike aircraft through.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s because the corps function of the USAF is to do just that, they&#39;re not designed or intended to provide CAS for ground forces, that&#39;s a secondary role they have only recently become only somewhat happy doing. They do strategic bombing, that&#39;s what Air Power means, it comes down to not even needing ground forces because Air Power wins the wars alone. They tried that in WW2, Korea, and Vietnam with bombing, they tried it during the Air Campaign in ODS, they tried in 1999 against Serbia. Every time they failed, then every time they decided afterwards that new technological advances would allow them to succeed the next time where they failed the last. </p>\n\n<p>However, to perform that mission requires them to get through enemy integrated air defenses, which is their specialty at this point. Everyone is so surprised by how poorly the Russian VKS is performing, but that is because they can&#39;t get through the Ukrainian IADS, which isn&#39;t even a very impressive one. Why can&#39;t the VKS not get through it? Because they suck at SEAD/DEAD. Whereas the USAF wrote the book on those missions. </p>\n\n<p>So if the USAF can suppress or destroy enemy air defenses to perform strategic strikes (deep rear area) they can also perform tactical support, which again is a requirement per the 1948 Key West Agreement. </p>\n\n<p>But tactical air support doesn&#39;t just mean CAS (which they are legally required to perform), it also means deep air support/air interdiction (arguably more important than CAS) as well as air reconnaissance, not to mention air superiority over the front lines so enemy air doesn&#39;t attack our ground troops. </p>\n\n<p>Which is where the imbalance really is. Not in providing fires but in protection, the US Army never neglected organic fires equipment, training, and doctrine, but we did ignore air defense because we were sure the USAF could protect the skies. And that is still true for most enemy aircraft, except UAVs, which aircraft and even standard radars have a very hard time finding. Which is why the US Army has invested heavily into SHORAD in the last couple years, and what the greatest lesson for this war is, that there needs to be a way to take out enemy drones while protecting your own.</p>\n</div>",

The USAF isn't meant to provide CAS, that is only one of its missions when performing tactical air support, one that it was meant to do the least of.

In this war they're largely static but in maneuver warfare those would be moving and huge. Remember the fabled 40 mile long convoy NW of Kyiv back in March that everyone wouldn't shut up about? The USAF was tasked to go after those, with CAS being a secondary role. Meanwhile, maneuver units looked out for themselves with organic fires, which meant artillery. \n\nThat's doctrine, the reality is that in actual conflicts the US usually uses aircraft predominately for fires mainly because they're usually available.

However it was limited specifically because at the time artillery was still firing nearly only dumb shells, whereas strike aircraft were dropping 500, 1000, or 2000 lb JDAM bombs that were incredibly accurate. A single bomb could do more damage on target than an entire battalion of artillery firing for an hour. \n\nThere were also ROE concerns in some locations using artillery, there were worries of firing arty hurting the hearts and minds effort (especially early on in Afghanistan, when US troops were denied the use of arty by Rumsfeld in lieu of strike aircraft, because Rumsfeld didn't want to replicate the Russians terror arty doctrine). There are also confliction issues using artillery (or mortars) in areas where you have drones flying or helicopters (want a MEDEVAC? Want arty? Pick one). \n\nAll that being said, the US Army (and Marines too!) never thought they'd stop relying on organic artillery.

Definitely a Patton series tho you can tell by the thicc tail). \n\nI've seen in some books pictures from the early '90s of more M60s being pushed overboard. I would have to guess those were the A3 models though I cant remember now, maybe some leftover USANG A1s.

Production of LNG, thanks to fracking, was up last year. It\u2019ll be even higher this year. Break even on new Shale wells is about ~70$/bbl. $80-90 is where it becomes attractive for serious exploitation. But, importantly, shale fracking produces BOTH NG and crude oil.

They allowed themselves to remain addicted to Russian compressed gas, despite repeated American warnings that this *eaxact* scenario might happen. This means that despite Europe\u2019s large consumption, the continent is generally geared to import Russian compressed gas not American LNG, which requires a totally different type of infrastructure. This means that American exporters could fill every harbor in Europe with LNG tankers, beach every ship on German shores, fly it in in bladders in cargo planes (very bad idea) and it won\u2019t make a bit of difference until next year when LNG terminals come online.
