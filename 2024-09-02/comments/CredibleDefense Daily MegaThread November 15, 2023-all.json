        "body": "I've been doing some digging on Russian Telegram channels (thanks, Google Translate) about a matter I'm very curious about and it seems that the conditions for contract soldiers are gradually improving. \n\nIn summer 2022 the average salary was about 150k rubles per month + 200k as a one-off bonus. This summer, 200k rubles as a monthly salary had become the standard in all recruiting ads and financial bonuses were raised to 600k rubles. \n\nhttps://t. me/ordenbat/44\n\nAn ad that has been running lately mentions a salary starting from 204k rubles with an one-off bonus of 1095k rubles, paid in three installments within a month of signing the contract. Such large bonus is obtained as the sum of several bonuses: the one of the Ministry of Defense, the one of the Oblast organizing the recruitment, and the potential one of the private firm(s) sponsoring the recruitment. The most generous contracts are organized by the Moscow Oblast, which has abundant resources at its disposal and generally pays on time (while other oblasts can afford smaller amounts and often with delayed payments). Due to this, many people from all over Russia sign a contract with the Moscow Oblast. In this specific case, the contract has to be signed physically in St. Petersburg, as part of the bonus is provided by an association of building contractors from the city. The term is 1 year (2 years for those under 27); the renewal in theory should be automatic according to the legal provisions of the partial mobilization of September 2022. Over the course of a year the signer should be entitled to 40 days of leave. Equipment will be provided to those who sign up but those who already have military equipment are encouraged to bring it with them: many recruits use a part of the initial bonus to buy advanced kits, which is the reason why Russian soldiers in the same unit are quite heterogeneously dressed and equipped.\n\nFor most of us in this sub, coming from Western Europe or North America, these are ridiculous figures compared to the risk (a contractor in Iraq in the 2000s was getting much more for a far smaller risk, and if I am not mistaken today in dollar terms a US Army recruit gets higher salaries and bonuses), but evidently for a certain segment of the Russian population this is not the case. Let's just remember that the mentioned salary IIRC is up to 8 times what an elementary school teacher gets in the poorest oblasts and the bonus is a godsend (e.g., to renovate one's home) for those living in almost absolute poverty. Recall [this article](https://russiapost.info/regions/majority) for example. To all of this we should add a certain level of ideological commitment to the cause. [This other article](https://re-russia.net/en/review/411/) is very interesting concerning the demographics of contract signers.\n\nThose who sign on as contract soldiers are an extremely diverse group. There are the 19-year-olds doing their military service and being persuaded to sign a contract (it's becoming quite relatively common to read obituaries of Russian soldiers born in 2003 or even 2004). There are the young people in their early 20s looking for easy money and adventure, who may not fully understand the risk that awaits them. There are 30-year-olds with debts or criminal records who go to the front to escape their lives. There are 50-year-old nationalists who volunteer \"to defend Russia from NATO\" or the like. And so on. The ad is looking for men with Russian passports and military papers between the ages of 18 and 59. They must not suffer from chronic or transmissible diseases - otherwise they will take anyone, by the administrator's admission. I remember it had been proven that the procedures for issuing Russian passports are being simplified, for instance, for immigrants from Central Asia who want to sign a contract. \n\nBenefits and support measures for the signer's family, legal aid, war veteran status at the end of the contract, life insurance are promised. In case of injury the benefit ranges from 350k to 3 million rubles; in case of death the family will get 12 million rubles. By legal aid, I don't know if they mean, for example, criminal record clearance (e.g., I know that in Russia getting a regular job for those with criminal records is very difficult, which prompts many to sign up for the front) and debt deferments. According to Conflict Intelligence Team, debts of the fallen soldiers cannot be transferred to family members and for active soldiers there is an extension of repayment terms. Given that consumer credit is widespread in Russia and many Russians have debts, these are things that are further pushing people into signing a contract. In addition, one's job will be maintained (meaning, if I understand correctly, the company that employs the volunteer will have to treat him as a furloughed worker and will not be able to fire him). Furthermore, despite the fact that the pool from which to recruit is getting smaller and smaller, recruitment for Storm Z units is also continuing: there are reports that 1500 men in jail for petty crimes in Moscow Oblast reportedly signed up to join Storm Z. Even if the period in prison to be served is short, a part of the convicts choose to leave for the front to clean up their criminal record and be able to find a job once home (if they survive...) while in other cases the harshness of Russian penal colonies is enough to make it tempting to go to war.\n\nThere is also another interesting psychological issue in my opinion: a man who has served as a contract soldier in the past years and is not employed in a defense industry or the like, in the event of a new wave of mobilization is likely aware that he's among the first ones on the list to be called up. So maybe the reasoning some people make is to sign a contract and get the big financial bonus, and possibly choose the military unit to serve in, rather than getting the mobilization letter without these benefits. From what I understand it's possible to choose the unit in which to serve, if one has contacts there who provide a letter of recommendation. This is also the case in Ukraine for those who sign a contract as a volunteer. For example, I was reading that those who want to join the famous 3rd Assault Brigade, if they are under 25 years old can go to the brigade's HQ and sign a contract there, while those who are older and are subject to the mobilization law, can get in touch with the brigade, receive a letter of recommendation and show up to the local mobilization office which will assign the recruit to the 3rd Brigade. \n\nAs for the Russian ad, they are looking for all roles (stormtrooper, machine gunner, sniper, scout, artilleryman, UAV operator, mechanic, etc.). If one has past experience in one of these specialties he will be assigned to that; if one is without any experience he will be trained in Voronezh where he will be trained in a specialty for which he's the most talented (I have a feeling it will be the stormtrooper one...). People signing up this specific contract should be assigned to units of the Western Military District. Apparently a significant portion of those signing up this contract are former members of PMC Wagner (although the latter's leadership criticizes the choice to sign contracts with the MoD and is working to reconstitute units linked to the Wagner Group within Rosgvardia). There are reports that 250 former Wagnerites have been assigned as coordinators of Storm Z units of the Western MD.\n\nIn the comments to that Telegram channel's post, there are numerous inquiries about the contract as well as testimony from people who have recently signed and state they have received the bonuses. \n\nIt seems that the new formations created in recent months, both of the Ground Forces and VDV, are being made up of contract soldiers. Regarding the geographic origin of the latters, without any surprise they are coming in large majority from poorer regions. As far as I have read the plurality of the members of the 70th Motorized Division and the 144th Motorized Brigade of the new 18th Army are from Northern Caucasus. Many other contract soldiers come from the Far East and Siberia. A very important contribution in absolute numbers is made by the populous oblasts of the Urals and Volga regions. Places like Bashkortostan and Tatarstan are very important pools of volunteers. The Russian Army is progressively returning to the situation at the beginning of the war, with most of the soldiers coming from the poorer regions - whereas mobilization, while disproportionately affecting (in relation to population) these regions, also brought large numbers of soldiers from the metropolitan areas of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In addition, one&#39;s job will be maintained (meaning, if I understand correctly, the company that employs the volunteer will have to treat him as a furloughed worker and will not be able to fire him). Furthermore, despite the fact that the pool from which to recruit is getting smaller and smaller, recruitment for Storm Z units is also continuing: there are reports that 1500 men in jail for petty crimes in Moscow Oblast reportedly signed up to join Storm Z. Even if the period in prison to be served is short, a part of the convicts choose to leave for the front to clean up their criminal record and be able to find a job once home (if they survive...) while in other cases the harshness of Russian penal colonies is enough to make it tempting to go to war.</p>\n\n<p>There is also another interesting psychological issue in my opinion: a man who has served as a contract soldier in the past years and is not employed in a defense industry or the like, in the event of a new wave of mobilization is likely aware that he&#39;s among the first ones on the list to be called up. So maybe the reasoning some people make is to sign a contract and get the big financial bonus, and possibly choose the military unit to serve in, rather than getting the mobilization letter without these benefits. From what I understand it&#39;s possible to choose the unit in which to serve, if one has contacts there who provide a letter of recommendation. This is also the case in Ukraine for those who sign a contract as a volunteer. For example, I was reading that those who want to join the famous 3rd Assault Brigade, if they are under 25 years old can go to the brigade&#39;s HQ and sign a contract there, while those who are older and are subject to the mobilization law, can get in touch with the brigade, receive a letter of recommendation and show up to the local mobilization office which will assign the recruit to the 3rd Brigade. </p>\n\n<p>As for the Russian ad, they are looking for all roles (stormtrooper, machine gunner, sniper, scout, artilleryman, UAV operator, mechanic, etc.). If one has past experience in one of these specialties he will be assigned to that; if one is without any experience he will be trained in Voronezh where he will be trained in a specialty for which he&#39;s the most talented (I have a feeling it will be the stormtrooper one...). People signing up this specific contract should be assigned to units of the Western Military District. Apparently a significant portion of those signing up this contract are former members of PMC Wagner (although the latter&#39;s leadership criticizes the choice to sign contracts with the MoD and is working to reconstitute units linked to the Wagner Group within Rosgvardia). There are reports that 250 former Wagnerites have been assigned as coordinators of Storm Z units of the Western MD.</p>\n\n<p>In the comments to that Telegram channel&#39;s post, there are numerous inquiries about the contract as well as testimony from people who have recently signed and state they have received the bonuses. </p>\n\n<p>It seems that the new formations created in recent months, both of the Ground Forces and VDV, are being made up of contract soldiers. Regarding the geographic origin of the latters, without any surprise they are coming in large majority from poorer regions. As far as I have read the plurality of the members of the 70th Motorized Division and the 144th Motorized Brigade of the new 18th Army are from Northern Caucasus. Many other contract soldiers come from the Far East and Siberia. A very important contribution in absolute numbers is made by the populous oblasts of the Urals and Volga regions. Places like Bashkortostan and Tatarstan are very important pools of volunteers. The Russian Army is progressively returning to the situation at the beginning of the war, with most of the soldiers coming from the poorer regions - whereas mobilization, while disproportionately affecting (in relation to population) these regions, also brought large numbers of soldiers from the metropolitan areas of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

If he can sell what he's doing for the value of Ukraine, and be able to pump it up for the sake of patriotism and victory, Zelensky has more ability to greatly influence public perception than many believe and more than even he sometimes realizes (though other times he's much more confident).\n\nLook at it this way. Already he won't expand conscription to younger ages despite the UAF and Rada wanting it, which means he's already going against the grain. He could sign that tomorrow and  that easily gets them through to 2025. But they maybe will need to expand to women too. If the situation is very bad now, they might need to go bigger. Though personally they need to unfuck their officer corps first, they grew too big too fast and now too many of them have no idea what they're doing. Which is why in the past I said 2024 they ought to do an economy of force rebuilding year doing minimal defensive ops to rebuild their army so in 2025, when the artillery drip turns up, they'll have the ground forces to exploit it, and hopefully other technological innovations needed to breach the minefields and defenses (which they can't really do now, good recruitment or not). \n\nHere's how they can pull off conscripting women:\n\nPass a deliberately vaguely written law that conscripts women in small numbers. Emphasize starting out that the policy is to deliberately keep them out of combat unless they volunteer after they are conscripted, everyone else is support, thus freeing up more men for combat arms jobs. Follow that for a bit. That alone would be a huge win, and not very controversial.. \n\nThen if male recruitment is still suffering, once controversy dies after conscripted females is accepted enough, wait till the next operational emergency where it's either use women or lose the battle, then start pushing female combat arms conscripts through abbreviated training into combat. Make a big deal of it afterwards, give out a bunch of Hero of Ukraine medals and turn a few into heroes to get in front of the media. Then after it starts being accepted that it can work, expand it. Sooner than later females are nearly as easy to mobilize as men.\n\nIt's not as hard as many think, definitely not impossible. Not in a war for national survival against an enemy doing the shit Russia is. \n\nAt the end of the day, if they're not willing to capitulate to whatever bullshit conditions Putin and Lavrov try to force Ukraine to accept, it's going to require sacrifices. And they sure aren't done yet. \n\nBut it takes a good leader to encourage everyone to swallow a bitter pill. Zelensky probably isn't that guy. Hopefully he's out in 2024...",

Though personally they need to unfuck their officer corps first, they grew too big too fast and now too many of them have no idea what they&#39;re doing. Which is why in the past I said 2024 they ought to do an economy of force rebuilding year doing minimal defensive ops to rebuild their army so in 2025, when the artillery drip turns up, they&#39;ll have the ground forces to exploit it, and hopefully other technological innovations needed to breach the minefields and defenses (which they can&#39;t really do now, good recruitment or not). </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s how they can pull off conscripting women:</p>\n\n<p>Pass a deliberately vaguely written law that conscripts women in small numbers. Emphasize starting out that the policy is to deliberately keep them out of combat unless they volunteer after they are conscripted, everyone else is support, thus freeing up more men for combat arms jobs. Follow that for a bit. That alone would be a huge win, and not very controversial.. </p>\n\n<p>Then if male recruitment is still suffering, once controversy dies after conscripted females is accepted enough, wait till the next operational emergency where it&#39;s either use women or lose the battle, then start pushing female combat arms conscripts through abbreviated training into combat. Make a big deal of it afterwards, give out a bunch of Hero of Ukraine medals and turn a few into heroes to get in front of the media. Then after it starts being accepted that it can work, expand it. Sooner than later females are nearly as easy to mobilize as men.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not as hard as many think, definitely not impossible. Not in a war for national survival against an enemy doing the shit Russia is. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, if they&#39;re not willing to capitulate to whatever bullshit conditions Putin and Lavrov try to force Ukraine to accept, it&#39;s going to require sacrifices. And they sure aren&#39;t done yet. </p>\n\n<p>But it takes a good leader to encourage everyone to swallow a bitter pill. Zelensky probably isn&#39;t that guy. Hopefully he&#39;s out in 2024...</p>\n</div>",

Although there are Ukrainians who joined as contract soldiers as a result of economic hardship - certainly the salary is very attractive compared to the average.

If not, what reason could Russia have for pulling these models from the front?",

Different groups were doing different things and there was no political consensus or greater administration.

I think the NUG is also happy with the current arrangement. We are both fighting against the military regime. There\u2019s no need for us to discuss in too much detail for now.\n\nIt's worth keeping in mind that out of all the NUG-pledged EAOs, the KNDF is kind of like a bright eyed young progressive newcomer coming into a Senate full of older, more conservative party members: they're on the same side and work together, but if you put AOC and Nancy Pelosi side by side, you won't see a whole lot in common. Same with the KNDF and, for example, the KIA. So this is basically the cutting edge of PDF/NUG/EAO collaboration. But the model is there and is working well in this case, and even in relative dinosaurs like the KIA, there is young talent on the rise with genuinely progressive aims. Burma often is characterized as being impossibly fractious and divided ethnically, but I think it's overblown: yes, there are real beefs that won't go away easily, but it's a very far cry from a Middle Eastern scenario. You rarely see acts of violence and terror carried out against civilians, and the fact that the EAOs are still capable of working together after all this time speaks to the fact that there is not nearly enough bad blood to justify being totally pessimistic about the potential for good-faith participation in a federative democratic system.  \n\n[Here's another article,](https://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/were-not-standing-still-taking-the-fight-to-tanintharyi/) this one brand new, that gives a good tableau of intergroup dynamics.",

It doesn't represent political leadership so much as a network to facilitate communications between the actual groups fighting on the ground. The ethnic dynamics between the Bamar majority and the many minorities are strained, at best, and for now mostly held in check by the fact that everyone hates the junta. But most of the muscle behind the resistance is provided by the minorities, upon whose goodwill the NUG is heavily dependant. As the junta increasingly loses ground, those tenuous compromises may start to fray. And most of the groups, especially most of the stronger groups, are not at all enthusiastic about simply swapping one Bamar-led government for another. There is a fairly large risk that if/when the junta is toppled, a power struggle breaks out, possibly a bloody one. \n\nAlso, the NUG is not the deposed government. That was the NLD, which was a real political party not just a big tent. There is some overlap in terms of people between the two, but they are two very different things in practice.

        "body": "[**Ukraine Seeks to Reignite Counteroffensive With Daring River Crossings** *Ukrainian toeholds across the Dnipro River in the south are a rare bright spot amid glum military news in recent months*](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraine-seeks-to-reignite-counteroffensive-with-daring-river-crossings-07e68b97?st=5twh17rcsh8y5vj)  \n\n> KHERSON, Ukraine\u2014Ukrainian marines slip across the Dnipro River at night in small groups to reinforce a growing contingent of troops engaged in a daring operation to reinvigorate Kyiv\u2019s military efforts in the occupied south.\n> \n> They have established three toeholds in and around villages on the eastern bank of the river in recent weeks, cutting off a road Russia uses to supply troops in the area, according to soldiers involved in the operation. The Ukrainians are hunkered down in basements and trenches and heavily outnumbered. Their hold is precarious.\n> \n> Still, it is a rare bright spot for Kyiv amid a number of somber developments, including the failure of its counteroffensive to gain much ground, a new Russian offensive in the east and uncertainty over additional military aid from the U.S., Ukraine\u2019s most important backer. Ukraine first publicly acknowledged the cross-river operation this week.\n> \n> Ukrainian forces recently transferred armored Humvees and at least one infantry-fighting vehicle to support troops on the Dnipro\u2019s eastern bank, the soldiers said. If the Ukrainians manage to amass sufficient units and armored vehicles there, they could seek to advance into territory where Russian defenses are less extensive than those further east that blunted the main thrust of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive.\n> \n> That could force Russia to reposition forces needed for offensives to the east, and pose a threat to Russian supply lines from occupied Crimea, a critical staging post and logistics hub for Moscow\u2019s war effort that Ukraine has been targeting with drone and missile attacks for weeks.  \n> \n> The operation on the opposite bank a few miles from the Ukrainian-held regional capital of Kherson is proving costly and hard going. Soldiers involved in the fight say they are under heavy fire. Russian drones constantly circle over their hastily dug trenches, coordinating artillery strikes each time they detect movement. As darkness falls, the Ukrainian troops use shovels to dig themselves deeper into the ground.\n> \n> \u201cWe need to be realistic about what can be achieved here,\u201d said Franz-Stefan Gady, an independent military analyst who recently toured the front lines in Ukraine. \u201cThe terrain is extremely difficult, making it not only a challenge to steadily resupply forces but also generate the necessary momentum to conduct sustained offensive operations.\u201d\n> \n> One private in Ukraine\u2019s 38th Marine Brigade who crossed to the eastern bank at the start of November said his unit had advanced 100 yards in the six days he was there before he was evacuated for treatment of a concussion.\n> \n> \u201cFor every fighter we have there, they have 10,\u201d said the 32-year-old private, who gave his name as Andriy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re sitting in trenches unable to even stick our heads out.\u201d\n> \n> Ukraine\u2019s recapture of Kherson last November was its last major advance. Russia withdrew troops across the river and began digging defenses.  \n> \n> In June, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam on Russian-held territory to the east of Kherson unleashed a torrent of water that inundated dozens of settlements along the Dnipro. With the river much wider and a crossing less of a threat, Russia moved some troops eastward to fend off Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, which began that month.\n> \n> As the waters receded over the summer, Ukraine stepped up cross-river raids that initially harassed Russian forces and led to the capture of some soldiers.\n> \n> Last month, the Ukrainians started establishing a presence on the eastern bank in the villages of Krynky and two other areas farther west.\n> \n> Ukraine has shrouded the operation in secrecy, offering no official comment until Monday, when Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, acknowledged while on a visit to Washington that there was a Ukrainian military presence on the left bank.\n> \n> Video posted by pro-Kremlin military bloggers shows houses in Krynky being hit by Russian munitions. \u201cThey are hiding in hedges, in houses,\u201d Russian military analyst Boris Rozhin wrote on Telegram on Monday. Russia\u2019s defense ministry said on Monday that it had captured a Ukrainian unit that tried to cross the river.\n> \n> The area around Krynky is heavily mined by Russian forces. The Ukrainians move forward in small groups to limit their exposure. And the onset of winter next month will complicate their efforts to move men and equipment across the water and stage mechanized advances with any armored vehicles brought over.\n> \n> Andriy, the marine private, arrived on the left bank on the night of Nov. 1.

The Ukrainians are hunkered down in basements and trenches and heavily outnumbered. Their hold is precarious.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it is a rare bright spot for Kyiv amid a number of somber developments, including the failure of its counteroffensive to gain much ground, a new Russian offensive in the east and uncertainty over additional military aid from the U.S., Ukraine\u2019s most important backer. Ukraine first publicly acknowledged the cross-river operation this week.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian forces recently transferred armored Humvees and at least one infantry-fighting vehicle to support troops on the Dnipro\u2019s eastern bank, the soldiers said. If the Ukrainians manage to amass sufficient units and armored vehicles there, they could seek to advance into territory where Russian defenses are less extensive than those further east that blunted the main thrust of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>That could force Russia to reposition forces needed for offensives to the east, and pose a threat to Russian supply lines from occupied Crimea, a critical staging post and logistics hub for Moscow\u2019s war effort that Ukraine has been targeting with drone and missile attacks for weeks.  </p>\n\n<p>The operation on the opposite bank a few miles from the Ukrainian-held regional capital of Kherson is proving costly and hard going. Soldiers involved in the fight say they are under heavy fire. Russian drones constantly circle over their hastily dug trenches, coordinating artillery strikes each time they detect movement. As darkness falls, the Ukrainian troops use shovels to dig themselves deeper into the ground.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe need to be realistic about what can be achieved here,\u201d said Franz-Stefan Gady, an independent military analyst who recently toured the front lines in Ukraine. \u201cThe terrain is extremely difficult, making it not only a challenge to steadily resupply forces but also generate the necessary momentum to conduct sustained offensive operations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One private in Ukraine\u2019s 38th Marine Brigade who crossed to the eastern bank at the start of November said his unit had advanced 100 yards in the six days he was there before he was evacuated for treatment of a concussion.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor every fighter we have there, they have 10,\u201d said the 32-year-old private, who gave his name as Andriy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re sitting in trenches unable to even stick our heads out.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s recapture of Kherson last November was its last major advance. Russia withdrew troops across the river and began digging defenses.  </p>\n\n<p>In June, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam on Russian-held territory to the east of Kherson unleashed a torrent of water that inundated dozens of settlements along the Dnipro. With the river much wider and a crossing less of a threat, Russia moved some troops eastward to fend off Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, which began that month.</p>\n\n<p>As the waters receded over the summer, Ukraine stepped up cross-river raids that initially harassed Russian forces and led to the capture of some soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, the Ukrainians started establishing a presence on the eastern bank in the villages of Krynky and two other areas farther west.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has shrouded the operation in secrecy, offering no official comment until Monday, when Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, acknowledged while on a visit to Washington that there was a Ukrainian military presence on the left bank.</p>\n\n<p>Video posted by pro-Kremlin military bloggers shows houses in Krynky being hit by Russian munitions. \u201cThey are hiding in hedges, in houses,\u201d Russian military analyst Boris Rozhin wrote on Telegram on Monday. Russia\u2019s defense ministry said on Monday that it had captured a Ukrainian unit that tried to cross the river.</p>\n\n<p>The area around Krynky is heavily mined by Russian forces. The Ukrainians move forward in small groups to limit their exposure. And the onset of winter next month will complicate their efforts to move men and equipment across the water and stage mechanized advances with any armored vehicles brought over.</p>\n\n<p>Andriy, the marine private, arrived on the left bank on the night of Nov. 1. The soldiers disembarked in different locations, avoiding Russian mines and enemy snipers and spotters, and waded through mud to reach the village of Krynky.</p>\n\n<p>The task for Andriy\u2019s brigade was to move forward in squad and company-size units and push into the forests around the village. They took up positions in rudimentary trenches and dugouts in the forest, but immediately began being pounded by Russian artillery.</p>\n\n<p>In the week Andriy spent on the eastern bank before being injured and evacuated, his unit moved forward 100 yards into the forest, he said.

Putin's regime was severely tested and it suggested that there were some serious vulnerabilities in his power base.

And of course the revolt caused a shakeup of leadership (again) at Russian GHQ, ensuring that there has not been a ton of continuity of command there.\n\nBut in terms of the military situation it doesn't seem to have cause too much trouble on the front. The Wagernites were (wisely) given the option to join the MoD formally, and many did. I suspect, though I dont have a ton of proof, that the terms of those deals was that Wagenerites returned to the SOF units that many of them had previously served in. In effect then the Spetsnaz and other commando units have become the shock troopers that Wagner was previously. So not a huge loss in capability. More painfully it seems that the prison-to-battlefield plan has ended, probably in part because of Wagner and in part because the easily released convicts were. The MoD now has better control over the total war effort, but it remains to be seen if they have the same capability that they did when Wagner could spearhead assaults like at Bakhmut. The battle of Avdiika seems in many ways to be a rerun of Bakhmut, with some of the same (for Ukraine) ugly geometry. But Russian attacks have, thus far, been pretty ineffectual. This *might* suggest a longterm lack of capability since the loss of Wagner. \n\nof course the underlying problem in assessing this is that Wagner went away, but it didnt. Russia has struggled since the coup, but not as much as one might hope. So was Wagner really that important to their Army at all, or just social media divas who built hype?

They even state so themselves:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hamas official vows to &#39;repeat&#39; Oct 7 attack repeatedly to teach Israel a lesson</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/hamas-official-vows-to-repeat-oct-7-attack-repeatedly-to-teach-israel-a-lesson/amp_articleshow/104903949.cms\">https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/hamas-official-vows-to-repeat-oct-7-attack-repeatedly-to-teach-israel-a-lesson/amp_articleshow/104903949.cms</a></p>\n\n<p>The act of genocide, such as executed on 07/10 is a clear threat of genocide.

                "body": ">Government debt (17.2% of GDP vs 123% for the USA\n\nThese figures mean the opposite of what you may think they mean. Russia's low gearing is a function of a lack of access to foreign capital markets, and indirect gearing through SOEs that (used) to carry a substantial portion of that debt. Companies like Gazprom and Rosneft were able to tap DCMs based on implicit, and at times explicit, sovereign backing with substantial debt loads. Most Western nations don't utilize that structure, while most EMs do. Chevron and Exxon, for example, have no sovereign involvement. Second, even in the OFZ market, there have been failed auctions since the war started. Those auctions have been tailing so much that they are called \"jerboas\" by traders. At best, they are usually being stopped on the screws. Heck, foreigners are still selling them at [30\u00a2](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-investors/unfriendly-foreign-investors-selling-russias-ofz-bonds-at-steep-discount-sources-idUKL8N34C4NR). \n\n>Still facing a choice between a ruble rout and recession, the Bank of Russia will opt for recession\n\nThis is a false choice and a function of Goodhart's law. The RUB is the one thing the Russian's can't entirely obfuscate (though they do try with capital controls,) and therefore, it becomes a matter of foreign embarrassment and ridicule. Hence, policy markers are forced into making terrible long-term policy choices to shore up the near-term garbage. In reality, monetary policy, and that too one-handed policy, isn't going to shift the fundamental underpinnings of inflation and the currency. The economy is essentially an extractive one and instead of diversifying it, the Russians have been forced to double down on it. You combine that with low liquidity, high domestic spending, lack of access to foreign capital markets, and an unwillingness of the local population to fund the government, and you're essentially plugging a dam that will break eventually because it's structurally weak. That does *not* mean they will experience some catastrophic failure or that their war aims will change, but it does mean a functionally weaker economy in the long run.",

The RUB is the one thing the Russian&#39;s can&#39;t entirely obfuscate (though they do try with capital controls,) and therefore, it becomes a matter of foreign embarrassment and ridicule. Hence, policy markers are forced into making terrible long-term policy choices to shore up the near-term garbage. In reality, monetary policy, and that too one-handed policy, isn&#39;t going to shift the fundamental underpinnings of inflation and the currency. The economy is essentially an extractive one and instead of diversifying it, the Russians have been forced to double down on it. You combine that with low liquidity, high domestic spending, lack of access to foreign capital markets, and an unwillingness of the local population to fund the government, and you&#39;re essentially plugging a dam that will break eventually because it&#39;s structurally weak. That does <em>not</em> mean they will experience some catastrophic failure or that their war aims will change, but it does mean a functionally weaker economy in the long run.</p>\n</div>",

The Soldier the sniper shot turned out to be the platoon medic, and he patched the guy up. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dvidshub.net/news/2863/256th-brigade-soldier-recalls-sniper-attack\">https://www.dvidshub.net/news/2863/256th-brigade-soldier-recalls-sniper-attack</a></p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s called professionalism.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "The Wall Street Journal has an article on how China and Russia are trying to exploit the current Israel Hamas conflict for their puporses \n\n___________________________________________________\n\n\nDistancing themselves from Israel, Russia and China have since focused on framing the war as part of a global power struggle against the U.S., with Israel reduced to little more than Washington\u2019s regional pawn.\n\nPutin, whose forces have flattened several Ukrainian cities, said in an address last week that his \u201cfists clench and eyes tear up\u201d as he watches the Israeli bombing of Gaza. Russian soldiers in Ukraine are fighting the same American \u201croot of evil,\u201d he said, and their battles \u201cwill decide the fate of Russia, and of the entire world, including the future of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nHamas has been appreciative of such signaling. Khaled Meshaal, one of the group\u2019s main leaders, said in a recent TV appearance that Hamas seeks \u201ccooperation with great powers China and Russia.\u201d He added that Russia has benefited from the Oct. 7 attack because it has diverted American attention from Ukraine and that China may be inspired by Hamas\u2019s raid for its own plans to capture Taiwan. Unlike Russia and China, the U.S. and most other Western nations consider Hamas, whose members killed some 1,400 Israelis and took hundreds hostage on Oct. 7, a terrorist organization.\n\nRussia\u2019s record, in Ukraine and elsewhere, is littered with atrocities. Putin began his presidency in 2000 by flattening Grozny, the capital of the then-rebellious Muslim republic of Chechnya. In Syria, a Russian bombing campaign reduced to rubble much of the city of Aleppo in 2016. And in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which the Russian air force could bomb without fear of air defenses, at least 25,000 Ukrainian civilians were killed during the monthslong Russian siege last year, according to municipal officials. The true toll may never be known because the U.N. and other independent organizations were never given access to Mariupol and the victims were routinely bulldozed into the rubble or buried in mass graves.\n\nChina, meanwhile, incarcerated upward of a million Muslims from its western Xinjiang region\u2014equivalent to the Gaza Strip\u2019s entire adult population\u2014in internment camps, according to American officials. China described these camps as providing vocational opportunities and most major Muslim nations have refrained from criticizing its repressive policies in Xinjiang.\n\u201cThat particular issue doesn\u2019t resonate in the \u2018Muslim world\u2019 the same way that the Palestinian issue does,\u201d said Neysun Mahboubi, director of the Penn Project on the Future of U.S.-China Relations at the University of Pennsylvania. As the war in Ukraine damages Russia\u2019s global appeal, and as America is criticized for its support of Israel, there \u201cis an opportunity for China to shape an image of being a responsible world power, and more so than its competitors, including the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nThe current crisis, and the support provided by the Biden administration so far, makes it evident that only a solid alliance with the U.S. can protect Israel, said Tuvia Gering, a China expert at the Institute for National Security Studies of Tel Aviv University.\n\u201cThere is no alternative for Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is not neutral. It\u2019s against Israel and is providing wind to the sails of those who wish to annihilate us. It\u2019s been indifferent to our suffering and it is exploiting it for its own geopolitical gains.\u201d\n\nFor Putin, who used to value Israel\u2019s neutrality and refusal to join Western sanctions over Ukraine, the new frost with Israel can be explained in part by the change in Russia\u2019s own demographics. Roughly one-quarter of Russia\u2019s population is now estimated to be Muslim, a share that keeps rising because of higher birthrates in Muslim areas and mass migration from Central Asia.\n\nThe bloodshed in Gaza has already sparked unrest in several Muslim republics of the northern Caucasus. In late October, as rumors spread that the region\u2019s Jews who had emigrated to Israel would be coming back as refugees, local vigilante groups raided hotels looking for Jewish guests and, on Oct. 29, stormed the international airport of Makhachkala after a scheduled flight from Tel Aviv landed there, waving Palestinian flags and chanting \u201cAllahu akbar.\u201d Russian authorities have since made some 200 arrests.  \n\nAn even more important factor, however, is Putin\u2019s drive to restore Soviet-era norms, an ideological campaign that also involves rewriting schoolbooks, erecting monuments to Stalin, and dismantling whatever remains of Russia\u2019s democratic institutions. That has also meant a rapprochement with Soviet-era allies, such as North Korea.\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s all part of Russia\u2019s overall slide back to Soviet times, to Soviet thinking, to Soviet traditions,\u201d said former Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev, who now lives in the West. \u201cThis is in line with the overall neo-Soviet policy of confrontation with the West.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The Wall Street Journal has an article on how China and Russia are trying to exploit the current Israel Hamas conflict for their puporses </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Distancing themselves from Israel, Russia and China have since focused on framing the war as part of a global power struggle against the U.S., with Israel reduced to little more than Washington\u2019s regional pawn.</p>\n\n<p>Putin, whose forces have flattened several Ukrainian cities, said in an address last week that his \u201cfists clench and eyes tear up\u201d as he watches the Israeli bombing of Gaza. Russian soldiers in Ukraine are fighting the same American \u201croot of evil,\u201d he said, and their battles \u201cwill decide the fate of Russia, and of the entire world, including the future of the Palestinian people.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has been appreciative of such signaling. Khaled Meshaal, one of the group\u2019s main leaders, said in a recent TV appearance that Hamas seeks \u201ccooperation with great powers China and Russia.\u201d He added that Russia has benefited from the Oct. 7 attack because it has diverted American attention from Ukraine and that China may be inspired by Hamas\u2019s raid for its own plans to capture Taiwan. Unlike Russia and China, the U.S. and most other Western nations consider Hamas, whose members killed some 1,400 Israelis and took hundreds hostage on Oct. 7, a terrorist organization.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s record, in Ukraine and elsewhere, is littered with atrocities. Putin began his presidency in 2000 by flattening Grozny, the capital of the then-rebellious Muslim republic of Chechnya. In Syria, a Russian bombing campaign reduced to rubble much of the city of Aleppo in 2016. And in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which the Russian air force could bomb without fear of air defenses, at least 25,000 Ukrainian civilians were killed during the monthslong Russian siege last year, according to municipal officials.

They're in it for the fantasy not to learn reality.\n\nHere's the state of things:\n\nFiber lasers are very practical and well developed as industrial products. Here's the world leader, and specifically the industrial product that's the closest match to what you'd want for military purposes: [https://www.ipgphotonics.com/en/products/lasers/high-power-cw-fiber-lasers/1-micron/yls-1-120-kw](https://www.ipgphotonics.com/en/products/lasers/high-power-cw-fiber-lasers/1-micron/yls-1-120-kw)\n\nThat product line tops out at 120 kw right now, in a cabinet about the size of a large washing machine or compact fridge (using water cooling).\n\nHere's a slide from a CSBA symposium a few years back comparing power levels to applications:\n\n[https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/Gunzinger-laser-slides-OK-TO-REPRODUCE.jpg](https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/Gunzinger-laser-slides-OK-TO-REPRODUCE.jpg)\n\nSo in terms of capability right now we have the building blocks for systems that can take out aircraft and cruise missiles at short ranges, and soft drones at longer ranges. Anti aircraft at longer ranges will take more power, and then any sort of anti ballistic role MUCH more power.\n\nTo put these power levels in context, we'll start with fiber lasers being typically 40% net wall plug efficiency. That means we need a 300 kw power source, which is around 400 hp. So this is feasible on a truck or similar. For a 1 mw class weapon we'd need 2.5 mw in, or 3350 hp. So that's practical for fixed installations or warships, maybe a road mobile setup using a group of trucks.\n\nFiber lasers have a scalable architecture, though the further you push the more precise the engineering has to be, so those power levels are on the horizon for the source.\n\nThe other piece is the beam director. We know how to build beam directors that can handle mw class chemical lasers, so the basic technology is there too. However, I don't want to trivialize the engineering. It will take time to develop and work out the kinks.\n\nBut none of this means laser defended systems suddenly become invulnerable. The more hardened the target the more time on target the laser needs to create effect. So saturation attacks will still work. Ironically countering artillery is going to be one of the harder tasks because a shell casing is pretty dang tough vs an aluminum aircraft, rocket, or missile body.\n\nAdditionally, once these are deployed people will start thinking about defenses such as lightweight ablative coatings and such. Reflective coatings are an obvious and intuitive idea but not particularly practical (and you'd need to be reflective in IR wavelengths).\n\nSo that's about the state of things. Laser weapons are currently making the leap from research prototype to practical system. The Navy has something like 6 projects in flight and has tested multiple lower power lasers on ships. The Army has handful of projects as well. I don't know anything about foreign developments.\n\nReally interesting and exciting stuff, but a far cry from the future portrayed in that comment, which I believe will never come to pass. Lasers will be part of the future. They will not solely dictate the future, and thinking so is naive fantasy stuff.\n\nOne interesting detail in all this is that company I linked above, IPG Photonics, was started by a Russian immigrant and currently has factories in the US, Germany, Russia, and Italy. The latest thing they've said in PR/interviews is they've successfully navigated the sanctions, and are looking to shift facilities to cheaper locations, mentioning Poland. They also have sales / business offices in like 50 places around the world, including several in China. They're not the only game in town but they've got a lot of the best IP locked up for another decade or so.",
