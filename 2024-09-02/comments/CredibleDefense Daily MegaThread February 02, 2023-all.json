It really depends exactly on the technology being used. For example China could have been using the truss frame as a faraday cage meant specifically to absorb the jamming frequencies expected, and then have an antenna sending a high power directional signal that would be hard to overpower from the ground.\n\nIt's also possible China has some signal noise deconstruction algorithms under their sleeve that they use to get data out of a noisy signal. China is very innovative in some ways, but I'd be suspect they have the upper hand on something like signal communication, since it's a pretty heavy academic subject, and plagarism is their middle name in that regard.\n\nWho knows though really what exactly the capabilities are on each side.

In response to OP.\n\nHe does not really have support. Support implies that a majority of the Russian people would support him against a genuine alternative. What he has now is acceptance. \n\nIn, for example, 2010? *Then* he had true support. Then he was still the great redeemer who conquered Chechnya where Yeltsin failed. He was Prime Minister and not President when Medvedev ordered the tanks into Georgia and won that war, but he was close enough to catch the reflected glory. He was the man in the big chair when the oligarchs went to jail and Russian GDP grew 5+% per year, every year. When oil prices were high and when re-armament started in earnest. The liberals thought he was not bad and the right-wingers thought that he was competent. \n\nBut that was a long time ago. First there were the big protests in 2011 because the legislative elections were rigged. Then the slow, grinding impact of the sanctions after 2014- Ru GDP grew at a slower pace than most developed nation GDP, *even though Russia was not yet a developed nation.* This led to bad times for a lot of Russians, including the raising of the sacred retirement age- still a big deal for the ordinary Russian, if you read the news comments. And there was the slow end of tolerance, the termination of effective political opposition *of any kind*, and now a humiliating, costly, and deadly war in Ukraine that he refuses to even call a war. \n\nThe average Russian on the street does not now feel the same way about Putin as they did earlier. \n\n>From what I can gather, jailed or not, I don't think Navalny had anything nearing a chance.\n\nOf course he didn't have a chance. To have a chance you need to be able to get your message out and build support. You have to be able to run in the first place. Navalny could not even attempt do either of these things. He could not do them because the entire apparatus of the state was used to suppress him, just as it was used to suppress Sergei Furgal, Boris Nemtsov, etc. Obama would've had no chance if Bush had thrown him in jail in 2006 and banned his words from the press, right? \n\nThere are no mass activities in support of Putin. There are none at all in favor of anything. Putin does not cultivate support. Putin cultivates apathy. He does this by destroying alternatives before they can become real alternatives.",

Then the slow, grinding impact of the sanctions after 2014- Ru GDP grew at a slower pace than most developed nation GDP, <em>even though Russia was not yet a developed nation.</em> This led to bad times for a lot of Russians, including the raising of the sacred retirement age- still a big deal for the ordinary Russian, if you read the news comments. And there was the slow end of tolerance, the termination of effective political opposition <em>of any kind</em>, and now a humiliating, costly, and deadly war in Ukraine that he refuses to even call a war. </p>\n\n<p>The average Russian on the street does not now feel the same way about Putin as they did earlier. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>From what I can gather, jailed or not, I don&#39;t think Navalny had anything nearing a chance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course he didn&#39;t have a chance. To have a chance you need to be able to get your message out and build support. You have to be able to run in the first place. Navalny could not even attempt do either of these things. He could not do them because the entire apparatus of the state was used to suppress him, just as it was used to suppress Sergei Furgal, Boris Nemtsov, etc. Obama would&#39;ve had no chance if Bush had thrown him in jail in 2006 and banned his words from the press, right? </p>\n\n<p>There are no mass activities in support of Putin. There are none at all in favor of anything. Putin does not cultivate support. Putin cultivates apathy. He does this by destroying alternatives before they can become real alternatives.</p>\n</div>",

But Mo\u00efse\u2019s death in July 2021 \u2013 and a new earthquake the following month \u2013 sent the situation spiralling out of control.\n\n>Mo\u00efse was replaced by an acting president, Ariel Henry, who is unelected and widely viewed as illegitimate. In September, the G9 gang coalition blockaded the main port and fuel terminal after Henry caused fuel prices to double when he announced a cut to fuel subsidies \u2013 a development that brought the crisis to new heights. Haiti is now experiencing its worst-ever famine, with 4.7 million people facing acute hunger.\n\n>...\n\n>Arguably the two most important steps for the restoration of order are ending the gangs\u2019 power and holding meaningful new elections. Both seem a distant prospect.\n\n>One suggestion is the deployment of international forces, an idea that has Henry\u2019s support. Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau discussed the prospect of a Canadian-led force at a summit on Tuesday, with the US reluctant to send troops itself.\n\n>There is some support in Haiti for such an idea but critics say it could simply escalate the violence. Trudeau appeared cautious about the proposal, although Canada did send armoured vehicles for the police to use.\n\n>...\n\n>Meanwhile, as long as Henry\u2019s power remains unchecked, opposition leaders appear uninterested in agreeing a timetable for new elections. With an intransigent leader and foreign intervention such a vexed question, it is hard to see Haiti beginning to emerge from crisis any time soon.\n\nThe police [were in open revolt](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/02/haiti-cops-outgunned-gangs) the last couple of weeks.\n\n>Masked men raced around Port-au-Prince on motorbikes, firing their guns into the air, blocking major roads with burning tyres and bringing the Haitian capital to a standstill.\n\n>At one stage, the rioters flooded into the airport, trapping the prime minister, Ariel Henry, inside, and also attempted to break into Henry\u2019s residence.\n\n>Given the extreme gang violence that has seized Haiti in the past year, the disorder was in some ways unsurprising.\n\n>This time, however, it was not the bandits terrorising the capital, but the country\u2019s police force: enraged by a spate of police killings, officers took to the streets last week to demand a government response.\n\n>...\n\n>\u201cPolice officers feel the authorities do not care about their lives and taking to the street is the only way to be heard,\u201dsaid Francisco Occil, spokesperson for Synapoha, a police union.\n\n>The catalyst that set off the latest rebellion was a grisly video showing the bodies of six young police officers lying naked on the floor, their weapons laid on top of them \u2013 a morbid attempt to humiliate the officers and demonstrate the power of the gangs.\n\n>The six officers, killed in the shootout with the Savien gang in the town of Liancourt, bring the number of officers killed in January to 15. At least 54 officers were killed by the gangs in 2022.\n\n>The Caribbean nation has only 9,500 police officers serving its population of 12 million and they must fulfil many security roles, including those of the army. Haiti\u2019s military was disbanded in 1995 for launching a series of coups and committing human rights abuses.\n\n>But Haiti\u2019s security forces are outgunned by the gangs who flash their cash and automatic weapons on social media. They are also poorly led, said Louis-Henri Mars, the director of the Haitian peacebuilding non-profit Lakou Lap\u00e8.\n\nYesterday, the Prime Minister of Jamaica was the first to express willingness t[o send troops and police as part of a multi-nation force](https://apnews.com/article/politics-canada-government-united-states-nations-caribbean-89d772fd9afaf86e0303e1bc2162c1bb).\n\n>Jamaica\u2019s prime minister said his government is willing to send soldiers and police officers to Haiti as part of a proposed multinational security assistance deployment.\n\n>The announcement comes a week after U.N. special envoy for Haiti Helen La Lime said she hoped that the U.N. Security Council would deal \u201cpositively\u201d with the pending request from Haiti\u2019s government for international armed forces despite the U.S. and Canada showing no interest.\n\n>Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told the island\u2019s House of Representatives on Tuesday that he wants to help Haiti and \u201csupport a return to a reasonable level of stability and peace, which would be necessary for any inclusive, democratic process to take root.\u201d\n\n>The announcement appears to mark the first time that a nation in the Western Hemisphere publicly offers boots on the ground after Haiti\u2019s prime minister and other top officials requested the immediate deployment of foreign troops in early October amid a crippling fuel siege blamed on the country\u2019s most powerful gang.\n\n>U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and La Lime have backed Haiti\u2019s plea to no avail.\n\n>The U.N. Security Council has mulled the request but taken no action, opting instead to issue sanctions on people including Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, a dominant gang leader and former police officer blamed for masterminding multiple massacres.",

With an intransigent leader and foreign intervention such a vexed question, it is hard to see Haiti beginning to emerge from crisis any time soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/02/haiti-cops-outgunned-gangs\">were in open revolt</a> the last couple of weeks.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Masked men raced around Port-au-Prince on motorbikes, firing their guns into the air, blocking major roads with burning tyres and bringing the Haitian capital to a standstill.</p>\n\n<p>At one stage, the rioters flooded into the airport, trapping the prime minister, Ariel Henry, inside, and also attempted to break into Henry\u2019s residence.</p>\n\n<p>Given the extreme gang violence that has seized Haiti in the past year, the disorder was in some ways unsurprising.</p>\n\n<p>This time, however, it was not the bandits terrorising the capital, but the country\u2019s police force: enraged by a spate of police killings, officers took to the streets last week to demand a government response.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPolice officers feel the authorities do not care about their lives and taking to the street is the only way to be heard,\u201dsaid Francisco Occil, spokesperson for Synapoha, a police union.</p>\n\n<p>The catalyst that set off the latest rebellion was a grisly video showing the bodies of six young police officers lying naked on the floor, their weapons laid on top of them \u2013 a morbid attempt to humiliate the officers and demonstrate the power of the gangs.</p>\n\n<p>The six officers, killed in the shootout with the Savien gang in the town of Liancourt, bring the number of officers killed in January to 15. At least 54 officers were killed by the gangs in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>The Caribbean nation has only 9,500 police officers serving its population of 12 million and they must fulfil many security roles, including those of the army. Haiti\u2019s military was disbanded in 1995 for launching a series of coups and committing human rights abuses.</p>\n\n<p>But Haiti\u2019s security forces are outgunned by the gangs who flash their cash and automatic weapons on social media. They are also poorly led, said Louis-Henri Mars, the director of the Haitian peacebuilding non-profit Lakou Lap\u00e8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yesterday, the Prime Minister of Jamaica was the first to express willingness t<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-canada-government-united-states-nations-caribbean-89d772fd9afaf86e0303e1bc2162c1bb\">o send troops and police as part of a multi-nation force</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jamaica\u2019s prime minister said his government is willing to send soldiers and police officers to Haiti as part of a proposed multinational security assistance deployment.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement comes a week after U.N. special envoy for Haiti Helen La Lime said she hoped that the U.N. Security Council would deal \u201cpositively\u201d with the pending request from Haiti\u2019s government for international armed forces despite the U.S. and Canada showing no interest.</p>\n\n<p>Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told the island\u2019s House of Representatives on Tuesday that he wants to help Haiti and \u201csupport a return to a reasonable level of stability and peace, which would be necessary for any inclusive, democratic process to take root.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The announcement appears to mark the first time that a nation in the Western Hemisphere publicly offers boots on the ground after Haiti\u2019s prime minister and other top officials requested the immediate deployment of foreign troops in early October amid a crippling fuel siege blamed on the country\u2019s most powerful gang.</p>\n\n<p>U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and La Lime have backed Haiti\u2019s plea to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>The U.N. Security Council has mulled the request but taken no action, opting instead to issue sanctions on people including Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, a dominant gang leader and former police officer blamed for masterminding multiple massacres.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

But mainstream politicians are now calling for the Leopards to be sold for a nominal fee to Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, replacing the tanks that their governments plan to send to Ukraine.

Germany\u2019s decision to break with an historical taboo and send Leopards to Ukraine, plus growing international criticism of the Swiss for blocking arms shipments requested by allies, has triggered a shift in the popular mood. \n\n>In a recent poll, more than half the population broadly favored allowing re-exports of Swiss-made ammunition to help Ukraine\u2019s war effort.\n\n>The 96 tanks stored in Switzerland would represent nearly a third of the 300 Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy says he needs to begin to turn the tide of the war with Russia. The vehicles were originally scheduled for sale in 2014 on the basis that they were surplus to requirements. \n\n>Any sale of the tanks would require a large-scale decommissioning and therefore also a resolution from parliament, a spokeswoman for the Swiss Defense Ministry said by email. So far, Switzerland has not received any request from Germany to sell back some of the tanks to manufacturer Rheinmetall AG, nor does it have any pending requests from other countries, she said.\n\n>The presence of so many redundant fighting vehicles underscores how heavily militarized landlocked Switzerland really is, and the importance of the arms industry. Weapons worth more than $800 million were shipped abroad in 2021, and military service is still mandatory despite its neutral status. \n\n>Riniker has called for the Leopard tanks to be formally decommissioned, and then sold for as little as one symbolic franc to Switzerland\u2019s eastern neighbors, on condition that those tanks never actually then get re-exported to Ukraine. Switzerland doesn\u2019t need all the tanks, she says, and even though her proposal was voted down on its first reading last week, she is keen to push the idea to a vote again this spring. \n\n>\u201cThe war has changed the discussion in Switzerland in terms of what possibilities do we have within the very strict arms export law,\u201d she says. \u201cIt looks like decommissioning these tanks could get a majority.\u201d\n\n>The idea also has the support of the left-of-center party Gruenliberale. \u201cThe sale of decommissioned army materiel falls under the arms export regime, which means that there are no legal or political neutrality issues,\u201d MP Melanie Mettler told newspaper NZZ. The socially conservative Die Mitte party has also signaled support, provided the tanks are sold at competitive prices.\n\n>>Re-Exporting Swiss Ammo\n\n>The security policy committee of Parliament\u2019s lower house last week voted in favor of scrapping clauses Switzerland put into arms deals with other countries that prohibit them from re-exporting those munitions, provided the weapons are bound for Ukraine.

Ukraine\u2019s longest-range bomb is the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, which has a range of 53 miles. \n\nFriday\u2019s package follows a joint announcement by the US and Germany last week to send main battle tanks in a shift towards heavier and more offensive weaponry as the west seeks to prepare Ukraine to go back on the counteroffensive in the spring. Russia has amassed more than 300,000 troops in Ukraine and is stepping up artillery attacks in brutal battles in the east of the country. Ukrainian officials warn Moscow is preparing to go back on the offensive in the coming weeks.\n\nWhile the bomb system will help Ukraine attack Russian targets previously out of reach, it falls short of Kyiv\u2019s pleas for the even longer-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which can reach 185 miles.\n\nUS officials continue to rebuff Ukrainian requests for ATACMS over concerns that Kyiv would use the systems to strike targets inside of Russia, risking drawing Moscow into direct conflict with NATO.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday warned the decision to send longer-range bombs could prolong the war.\n\n\u201cNow we are striving to push away \\[Ukrainian\\] artillery to a distance that will not threaten our territory,\u201d Lavrov said in an interview with state newswire Ria Novosti. \u201cThe longer the range of weapons supplied to the Kyiv regime by the west, the further away we need to move them from Russian borders.\u201d\n\nThe US will grant contracting funds for Ukraine to purchase the ground launched small diameter bombs, part of about $1.7bn in assistance coming from a fund called the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. The package will also include $425mn in aid to come directly from US weapons stockpiles.\n\nThe relatively low-cost system is a joint project by Saab and Boeing, which combines a 113kg precision-guided munition with a rocket. According to Saab, the system is so precise it can hit within the radius of a car tyre.\n\nThe package would also include air defence components, additional ammunition and spare parts for systems already on the battlefield, people familiar with the matter said.",

Why not replace them with people who were right?</p>\n\n<p>From RAND authors to the Pentagon, people who said Russia was too strong, Ukraine too weak, weapon aid would be a waste, etc., are still promoting a mantra of self-deterrence when it&#39;s clear Putin will not stop until he&#39;s stopped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the referred RAND report: <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html\">https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html</a></p>\n\n<p>This is a previous article by the author, arguing that Russia is too strong and that Western weapons won&#39;t make a difference: <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/21/weapons-ukraine-russia-invasion-military/\">https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/21/weapons-ukraine-russia-invasion-military/</a></p>\n\n<p>Now he says that a prolonged war is against the interests of the US, realizing that Ukraine might win. Ironically, he also refers to WW1 where Russia lost in a prolonged war, but arguing that this time it will be different for some reason.</p>\n</div>",

I have a less optimistic view of the Quad, but it's more because the nature of the security challenge that India faces with China (i.e., the Himalayas/Indian Ocean) is a different theater than the South China Sea is, which from an Indian POV, would take precedent. I am almost certain that Washington is aware of this and isn't banking on India sending troops if China invades Taiwan. If that's your reference benchmark of what a successful alliance looks like in Asia, you're using the wrong metric of success. The nature of competition with China isn't just an SCS-specific field - you can look at what they're doing in Bhutan or the Indian Ocean to see that these are also active fields of competition and why India is still a valuable partner to the US.\n\nA SEATO-equivalent for Asia would quickly devolve into a political minefield. Looking at NATO, the military component is obviously a major factor, but there's a lot of political development and integration that gets handled through the EU that has a supportive effect of NATO. The comparable institutions in Asia (namely ASEAN, for the purposes of the South China Sea) are much less geared for this kind of purpose which would be one big issue.\n\nAnother issue is that every country in Asia approaches the challenge from China differently. While you could say the same about Russia (given the German attitudes towards gas and whatnot), China is, for better or for worse, much more economically integrated in Asia than Russia is in Europe. As such, each country in Asia is going to have a different policy with respect to China that using a blanket alliance structure isn't really going to solve.\n\nWorse, you're going to cost yourselves potential partners (like South Korea or India) that aren't as hawkish on China in the South China Sea as, say, Japan or Taiwan, but can still have vital usefulness against China generally. For these countries, small details, like, for instance, the THAAD installation in Korea, can be underrated victories over Chinese capabilities.\n\nIf you want to resurrect SEATO, you should first ask yourself why SEATO doesn't exist today and work from there - it's a bad framework, and Quad isn't supposed to be a copy+paste of NATO in Asia",

For these countries, small details, like, for instance, the THAAD installation in Korea, can be underrated victories over Chinese capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to resurrect SEATO, you should first ask yourself why SEATO doesn&#39;t exist today and work from there - it&#39;s a bad framework, and Quad isn&#39;t supposed to be a copy+paste of NATO in Asia</p>\n</div>",

It had two volumes and you can get both of them completely for free. You can also find On War for free in English, HOWEVER, the free English version is not the best translation. Delbruck&#39;s book you can also find for free on archive.org. So, as a whole, no need to purchase anything. Sorry for mentioning this so late! I hope you haven&#39;t purchased anything.</p>\n\n<p>TIK already has 42 videos published on the Stalingrad battle so there already is a lot to watch, however, Id say an optimistic claim is that he will finish the documentary until the end of this year. He now paused working on it for some time but he will begin at some point again. Consider checking out the Crusader videos. They are amazing because you can see the maneuver warfare that happened in North Africa.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": ">but he has reportedly become more supportive of strikes against Russian targets there\n\nGetting so sick of hearing this. All this speculation about US intentions about Crimea based on basically brief sentences in one NYT article that cited anonymous sources. The article even concluded that the US has not even established a policy on retaking Crimea/isn't really leaning towards supporting it. Yet now suddenly the dialogue is constantly shifting towards US support for \"striking Crimea\" and \"retaking Crimea\" when in reality there's be almost no communication on the subject from the US. It's almost like people who supported striking Crimea smacked some anonymous quotes in the article in order to pressure the administration to make a statement about it. Very frustrating. Honestly, I have never believed the US would support a full military liberation of Crimea nor do I think it's realistically in the cards for Ukraine in the near future. I think even in the proposed framework of an escalate to deescalate strategy (and I cannot say how much I love that meaningless phrase being applied to US policy suddenly now) focusing on Crimea doesn't make an awful lot of sense. (I also don't agree that the above is what Biden is actually doing either). I think that the support of tanks is meant to show that the West is just as capable of being in this for the long haul as Russia. Same with the longer-range bombs.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>but he has reportedly become more supportive of strikes against Russian targets there</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Getting so sick of hearing this. All this speculation about US intentions about Crimea based on basically brief sentences in one NYT article that cited anonymous sources. The article even concluded that the US has not even established a policy on retaking Crimea/isn&#39;t really leaning towards supporting it. Yet now suddenly the dialogue is constantly shifting towards US support for &quot;striking Crimea&quot; and &quot;retaking Crimea&quot; when in reality there&#39;s be almost no communication on the subject from the US. It&#39;s almost like people who supported striking Crimea smacked some anonymous quotes in the article in order to pressure the administration to make a statement about it. Very frustrating. Honestly, I have never believed the US would support a full military liberation of Crimea nor do I think it&#39;s realistically in the cards for Ukraine in the near future. I think even in the proposed framework of an escalate to deescalate strategy (and I cannot say how much I love that meaningless phrase being applied to US policy suddenly now) focusing on Crimea doesn&#39;t make an awful lot of sense. (I also don&#39;t agree that the above is what Biden is actually doing either). I think that the support of tanks is meant to show that the West is just as capable of being in this for the long haul as Russia. Same with the longer-range bombs. The tanks are 100% a signal of investment in Ukraine and Ukraine&#39;s future, not the keys to Crimea, and they should be treated as such. Whether that signaling is enough to get Putin to the table I really don&#39;t know, but I remain convinced this will end in negotiation.  </p>\n\n<p>Edit: For all the big talk of &quot;Russia must win&quot;, I really think the calculus for Putin has changed.

At the start of the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine and Russia could agree to disagree, but Ukraine\u2019s successes on the battlefield have led him to take a harder line.

If Ukrainian forces are ever in a position to retake it, he will come under huge \u2014 perhaps unstoppable \u2014 domestic pressure to push on. For this reason, **even if Zelenskyy has privately promised the United States he would negotiate over Crimea in return for increased military aid**, Washington should have serious doubts about this ability to deliver. Helping Ukraine to threaten Crimea is therefore unlikely to advance productive negotiations, but it just may spark a nuclear war.\n\nHaven't thought about that, but it kinda makes sense to me now.

                            "body": "The issue here is probably more a political one. Losing Donbas would be a major embarrassment for the Russian government. Losing Crimea, however, would be a complete catastrophe. Unlike Donbas it's a territory Russia has considered its own and fully integrated into the Russian state almost a decade ago, and while I am happy that the whole nuclear fear-mongering has died down since last spring, this is a case where you would need to take a closer look at Russia's non-conventional options again. If Ukraine invaded Crimea, Putin may well escalate in ways not seen so far - because that's what nuclear deterrence is for: protecting your territory (even if it is not really legally yours).\n\nAnd back to the topic of taking Donbas: you don't have to storm highly defended cities, you can circumvent them and cut them off. Kherson was extremely well defended and Ukraine's progress in the months leading up to its capture was agonisingly slow and costly.

Losing Crimea, however, would be a complete catastrophe. Unlike Donbas it&#39;s a territory Russia has considered its own and fully integrated into the Russian state almost a decade ago, and while I am happy that the whole nuclear fear-mongering has died down since last spring, this is a case where you would need to take a closer look at Russia&#39;s non-conventional options again. If Ukraine invaded Crimea, Putin may well escalate in ways not seen so far - because that&#39;s what nuclear deterrence is for: protecting your territory (even if it is not really legally yours).</p>\n\n<p>And back to the topic of taking Donbas: you don&#39;t have to storm highly defended cities, you can circumvent them and cut them off. Kherson was extremely well defended and Ukraine&#39;s progress in the months leading up to its capture was agonisingly slow and costly.

Recon forces are usually some of the best trained and most valuable, often its even left to special operation forces to do it. \n\nSpeaking as a former recon team leader/sniper section leader, there are pros and cons of using legit recon. The pros are they'll likely take less casualties (though mistakes, screwups, or bad luck can and often have killed the teams to a man), and they could potentially perform their duties without the enemy even knowing they're being watched. But recon teams are not meant to make contact at all, they sneak and peak. They'd do a zone recon of the UAF front lines, try to find OPs, forward outposts, heavy weapon positions, but from a distance using magnified optics, thermals, etc. But the cons is those teams are only going to see what's visible from their position. They likely won't know where the mines are, won't know where the camouflaged positions are, won't know where the fighting positions are that aren't manned unless they're actively repelling attacks (otherwise under cover), won't see into trenches inside buildings or in defilade like rear slopes, etc. So the value of their recon is going to be limited. \n\nTo get that further intel typically requires a movement to contact.

And while western type infantry, especially US, UK, Aussie, they can definitely accomplish a movement to contact more effectively than the Russians, they'd still take heavy casualties, and they'd have trouble replacing them because we're not geared up to churn out replacements especially while retaining quality.

This highway leads straight down the gullet to Debal'tseve, which strikes me as *hugely* important as a trainyard junction. Debal'tseve is located exactly between Donetsk and Luhansk, with main lines leading directly to Donestk, Luhansk, and Russia to the east. This makes Debal'tseve both crucial to protect and a natural marshaling point. Keeping Ukrainians far away from Debal'tseve is reason enough to want to hold (or at least pressure) Bakhmut, but the strategic significance of Debal'tseve also leads into another point: Streetlight effect and Ukraine's center.\n\nRussia pushes at Bakhmut because Russia *can* push at Bakhmut. As stated, Debal'tseve is a natural martialing point and the simplest route from Debal'tseve to Ukrainian forces is the M03. I suspect that Russia's best bet at this point is to simply apply as much pressure as possible at Ukraine's center to delay their advance everywhere else in the hope that maybe Ukraine runs out of resources and friends before Russia does.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>For a while now I&#39;ve been thinking that the real point of Bakhmut is Debal&#39;tseve.</p>\n\n<p>The only real strategic significance of Bakhmut that I can see is that it controls access to the M03. This highway leads straight down the gullet to Debal&#39;tseve, which strikes me as <em>hugely</em> important as a trainyard junction. Debal&#39;tseve is located exactly between Donetsk and Luhansk, with main lines leading directly to Donestk, Luhansk, and Russia to the east. This makes Debal&#39;tseve both crucial to protect and a natural marshaling point. Keeping Ukrainians far away from Debal&#39;tseve is reason enough to want to hold (or at least pressure) Bakhmut, but the strategic significance of Debal&#39;tseve also leads into another point: Streetlight effect and Ukraine&#39;s center.</p>\n\n<p>Russia pushes at Bakhmut because Russia <em>can</em> push at Bakhmut. As stated, Debal&#39;tseve is a natural martialing point and the simplest route from Debal&#39;tseve to Ukrainian forces is the M03. I suspect that Russia&#39;s best bet at this point is to simply apply as much pressure as possible at Ukraine&#39;s center to delay their advance everywhere else in the hope that maybe Ukraine runs out of resources and friends before Russia does. Bakhmut is easy to hit while also being the geographical center of the front line. Ukraine must naturally defend their center and Russia wants a nice simple grinding war of attrition that they can easily supply. Bakhmut gives them that.</p>\n</div>",

The US has invaded plenty of counties in Central America over the last several decades. If there were significant political instability in Mexico and a strongly anti-American government were to come to power, then the US would certainly consider both covert and overt interventions to change Mexico's government.

Russia absolutely dominated the Ukrainian economy and politics, even after Maidan, even after the war in Donbas, Russia was still Ukraine's biggest trading partner by far. Maidan happened almost entirely because of Russia, because they forced Yanukovych's hand (who as a politician was far more pragmatic and not a total puppet of Russia as commonly portrayed) to renege on the promise of being open to EU. And even when protests got really bad they made him escalate even further until it culminated in him fleeing and events that followed.\n\nEU was a pipe dream, Nato was a pipe dream. Back then we were still amidst recession and the Greek economic crisis and it became very clear that EU will become much less aggressive with adding new members and even if Ukraine did everything right it would have taken decades to join. And in the meantime there would have been so many opportunities and machinations to sway Ukraine  eastward again. And even if they did join, so what, Russia would still continue to dominate Ukrainian politics and economy. And on Nato Russia made themselves clear about Ukraine and Germans were happy to toe the line. There was no chance of them joining. \n\nEvery few years there is a big uproar in Mexico or Canada where they hate on US for various reasons, maybe their foreign policy, or trade, or racist US president, or whatever. What does US establishment do, they ignore it, they know that regardless of how much they huff and puff, they are going to come back to the fold because they hold so much economic and financial power over them, that they don't even need to threaten them and they are soon going to realize it on their own. Russia held the same amount of power, if not more, over Ukraine but instead, they chose to escalate in the worst way possible. To use a crude analogy US acts like a sugar daddy, not being worried because they know they hold the power, Russia acted like an abusive husband beating their wife for even looking at another.\n\nThe truth is this was never about losing influence over Ukraine, this has always been about revanchism and Russia not being able to cope with the loss of their empire. This war makes no sense from an economic, political, or security lens.  The revanchist attitude that has only gotten stronger since the late 90s and the \"loss\" of the Baltics and it is now the only thing that dominates their politics these days. Restoring the empire, the great ~~Soviet~~ Union. But even if the entire Ukrainian military collapsed tomorrow, we know from Iraq that \"winning\" a war in the 21st century is not accomplished just by defeating the military. They will lose, a year from now or a decade from now, there is no scenario in which Russia \"wins\" this. Soviet Union isn't coming back, Russian Empire isn't coming back, but fascists were never good at understanding that you can't just go back. \n\nWe are living through the death throes of the empire, few centuries from now when this entire period is just a few short paragraphs in a history book, it will say that the empire collapsed and the successor state tried few times to militarily restore it but were ultimately unsuccessful, just like the numerous times it has happened before.

This would mean the Russians could keep their fresh troops out of range, and shift them into the fight in much smaller groups that would tend to be a lot less of a target.\n\nIf that is the case, I see this as a continued war of attrition by the Russians, trying to overwhelm the Ukrainians with the force of numbers.

The classic problem of deterrence breakdown on the periphery of nuclear umbrellas (e.g., are we going to nuke China over a small strip of land in Vietnam, for example?) still exists, but in a multipolar world, states on the periphery now may decide the risk of deterrence breakdown is *too great* and thus shift sides (especially if their economies are already deeply interlinked with the adversary - a problem that did not exist in the Cold War).\n\nSimilarly, declining nations worried about being excluded from the \"great powers\" club may engage in acts of aggression or demonstrations of power to signal that they \"belong\" (some scholars argue this is why the UK decided to fight the Falkands War, given the islands themselves held no real value for the UK).   \n\n\nSo to answer your question, it's unlikely we'll see major nuclear powers engage in conventional war for *territory* but a conflict between the two is not unlikely (indeed, as I type this much of NATO is currently party to a major conflict in Ukraine against a nuclear adversary). Also worth pointing out that the gains from territorial conquest have decreased over time as territory itself has less importance today than it did in, say, an age where agrarian economies ruled the day. Fortunately for us, we appear to be entering a period where ideology matters much less (certainly less than the 20th century) and resources appear to be easily accessed in a global market..

The UAF launched a corps sized offensive from late May through July that largely failed and was also very costly especially around the attempts to cross the Inhulets around Davydiv Brid. So that's roughly two months on the offensive there making zero progress, all while they were losing territory in the Donbas because they didn't have enough manpower, arty  and supplies. The Fall Kherson counteroffensive was actually not doing all that well until the Russians made the decision to retreat, which had less to do with the Kherson offensive and more to do with the overall theater after the Kharkiv defeat and the emergency it caused. \n\nSpeaking of Kharkiv, Ukraine launched a ~division +  sized counteroffensive in Kharkiv in late April-early May that retook a lot of ground north to east of the city, which then led to seesaw operations for the next four months as the Russians counterattacked to retake what they lost, the Ukrainians tried like hell to hold it, then got pushed back, and counter attacking themselves. The initial offensive worked for the UAF because the Russians had about 5-7x weak BTGs strung out holding a ~60-70 km frontage, which was actually pretty close to what happened again in September, though further to the south. \n\nCounting the Kyiv counteroffensive in mid to late March (though it was so uncoordinated it can barely be called that), that's two operational level counteroffensives to retake the Kherson bridgehead, and two in Kharkiv. Then after Kharkiv there was another to retake Lyman, which was positional fighting that took the better part of a month despite calls the Russians were about to be encircled and annihilated the first week. And let's not forget about three months attacking the Svatove-Kreminna line with very little progress, and that was also roughly corps sized too.\n\nNowhere as tough a slog as the Russians in the Donbas, but that is because their objective is obvious, they announced it beforehand, and due to Five Eyes intelligence plus UA intel, it's next to impossible for them to achieve strategic or operational level surprise, so attacking a Ukrainian weak area has been and will be extremely difficult to perform, especially in the past when up until recently the Ukrainians outnumbered the Russians inside Ukraine by a pretty substantial amount (3-5x).",

And let&#39;s not forget about three months attacking the Svatove-Kreminna line with very little progress, and that was also roughly corps sized too.</p>\n\n<p>Nowhere as tough a slog as the Russians in the Donbas, but that is because their objective is obvious, they announced it beforehand, and due to Five Eyes intelligence plus UA intel, it&#39;s next to impossible for them to achieve strategic or operational level surprise, so attacking a Ukrainian weak area has been and will be extremely difficult to perform, especially in the past when up until recently the Ukrainians outnumbered the Russians inside Ukraine by a pretty substantial amount (3-5x).</p>\n</div>",

The war doesn't seem to be coming to an end anytime soon so let me just ask the following questions:\n\n- If we had a time machine and went back to Jan, 2022 and just told Russia that Ukraine won't join NATO, would the war have occurred?\n- If we tell them this now, would it stop?\n\nI'm sure I'm going to get responses that say \"we can't let Russia 'get away with...'\" and I totally agree.....but we live in the real world.  Does the US/NATO really think that Putin is going to say \"my bad everyone, we will pull out and BTW, take Crimera back as well\".  And......let's say Russia falls do we know what that post world looks like?\n\nAgain, I'm not some Russian sympathizer but it seems to be we are getting dangerously close to a real war and I'd like my family name to continue on without being in a Fallout 4 world scrapping typewriters and trying to avoid deathclaws.  \n\nAnyway.....let the insults commence....but I'm hoping for some real/reasonable answers.",

The war doesn&#39;t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon so let me just ask the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If we had a time machine and went back to Jan, 2022 and just told Russia that Ukraine won&#39;t join NATO, would the war have occurred?</li>\n<li>If we tell them this now, would it stop?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to get responses that say &quot;we can&#39;t let Russia &#39;get away with...&#39;&quot; and I totally agree.....but we live in the real world.  Does the US/NATO really think that Putin is going to say &quot;my bad everyone, we will pull out and BTW, take Crimera back as well&quot;.  And......let&#39;s say Russia falls do we know what that post world looks like?</p>\n\n<p>Again, I&#39;m not some Russian sympathizer but it seems to be we are getting dangerously close to a real war and I&#39;d like my family name to continue on without being in a Fallout 4 world scrapping typewriters and trying to avoid deathclaws.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyway.....let the insults commence....but I&#39;m hoping for some real/reasonable answers.</p>\n</div>",
