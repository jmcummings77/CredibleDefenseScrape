        "body": "The new 43rd Mechanized Brigade, the last to receive the insignia, [is active](https://nitter.net/Militarylandnet/status/1692628328006455640) in the Svatove sector, exactly in the area where the Russians managed to advance by about 4/5 kilometers around July 20 before being, largely, driven back. \n\nThe 68th Jager Brigade [seems to be](https://nitter.net/SarahAshtonLV/status/1692596761368440871) in that specific area too. It looks like Rybar was right, having announced elements of this brigade in that sector for several weeks. Let's recall that the 68th Brigade was one of those that led the Ukrainian offensive actions in the Velyka Novosilka sector in June. Throughout the winter this brigade covered the western flank of the Vuhledar sector supporting the 72nd Mech Brigade. In the first half of June it was brought into action in parallel with the 35th Marine Brigade achieving good successes (such as the liberation of Blahodate) after the first week that had seen a bumpy start in the flanks of the sector, by the 37th Marine Brigade in the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly River and by the 23rd and the 31st Mech Brigades in the western one (there was [talk](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/world/europe/ukraine-marines-counteroffensive.html) of the withdrawal from the front of one of the new brigades due to losses - in my opinion it could be the 23rd Brigade in fact, hopefully it's temporary).\n\nAt the present the area of responsibility of the 68th Brigade in the Southern Front (i.e. the immediate eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly) is expected to have been taken over by the 38th Marine Brigade (which entered the game this month) and elements of the 35th Marine Brigade. Which are supported perhaps by a battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. As of now the Velyka Novosilka sector is basically in the hands of the Ukrainian Marine Corps (recently formed as an armed force on its own, like with the Air Assault Forces), with all the four marine brigades deployed there. There are rumors about the creation of the 39th Marine Brigade but no definitive evidence yet afaik.\n\nThe \"twin\" brigades of the 43rd Mech, i.e., the 41st, 42nd and 44th are all between Kupyansk and Kreminna. The 41st should be in Kupyansk as confirmed by this [interview](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/ukraine-russia-training-nato-west-military); the 42nd is supposed to have been deployed in Kreminna for a month and a half; the 44th could be around Kupyansk, which may be proven by [this Rosomak](https://nitter.net/WarVehicle/status/1690644374147809280) (the 44th fields them) hit by Russian artillery fire. \n\nMore details are beginning to come out about what happened in the Svatove sector in the second half of July - the Russian offensive was a substantial operational failure but it appears that the Ukrainians had to employ a not negligible number of reserves. The Russians have employed a major grouping of troops in the area after all. In the last few days they would have returned to the attack from Kovalivka and gained about 1 km, but at the moment we are talking about minor movements that are not relevant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nLet's remember that when we talk about brigades, particularly the new ones, we are often talking about 1/2 battalions, not the whole brigade. The others maybe are either still in training or held in reserve. Since inter-brigade rotations are very rare for the UAF in the conflict, the rotations occur at the battalion level within the same brigade. For example, the area affected by the Russian advance of July 20/21 (between Novojehorivka and Karmazynivka) was the responsibility of the 66th Mech Brigade, and elements of this brigade probably had considerable casualties in the recent weeks; nevertheless, new recruits of the brigade [are training](https://nitter.net/Militarylandnet/status/1690765610953707520) in a battalion not currently deployed, perhaps near to relieving another battalion of the brigade that bore the brunt of the Russian offensive in the last month. \n\nOne interesting thing is that it appears the 93rd Mechanized Brigade, one of the most competent in the Ukrainian Army and among the main defenders of Bakhmut in both 2022 and 2023, [has received CV90s](https://nitter.net/GloOouD/status/1692285978822557717). This would explain why we saw a CV90 being damaged near Khromove last week. It could mean that the 21st Mech Brigade is still entirely between Svatove and Kreminna; the 1st Mechanized Battalion of this brigade has CV90s while the others probably have Rosomaks. Paging u/svenne here.\n\nThe 82nd Air Assault Brigade was officially deployed around Robotyne, Orikhiv sector. At the moment it has seen limited action, despite Russian propaganda that they would have already destroyed three Strykers that apparently... [were BTRs](https://nitter.net/naalsio26/status/1692170297661649026). But the fact that it was committed confirms what has been clear for some time: whether we like it or not, this direction is the Ukrainian General Staff's favored. Just a sunk cost fallacy? Or is there a clear and defined strategy behind this choice, perhaps supported by Ukrainian assessments that the Russian 58th Army is quite damaged after two months of fighting (then again, if as rumored it received two regiments of the 7th VDV Division as reinforcements, it could be the case)?\n\nThe 116th Mech Brigade also reportedly entered the scene in the sector, following the 118th already deployed in late July. That would leave the 117th as the last brigade not yet committed in the Orikhiv sector. We will see if the 47th Brigade will be rotated for a break or continue in frontline actions (ditto for the 65th Brigade, the 47th's \"colleagues\" for the vast majority of the actions, particularly in June). There are rumors that the 46th Airmobile Brigade also began to be deployed here, as would elements of the 71st Jager Brigade - a sign that the Air Assault Forces Command (of which the 71st is part too) is beginning to get very heavily involved in the actions in this sector. \n\nAt this point, not taking into account the non-deployed battalions of the already committed brigades and the detached battalions, the largest Ukrainian reserve in terms of non-committed brigades are a few brigades of the Offensive Guard and the usual \"old\" three mechanized brigades that have been off the radar for months (61st, 62nd, 115th - although the latter might be in the rear of Kupyansk). For the Offensive Guard, Kara-Dag and Spartan Brigades are already deployed in the Orikhiv sector. The Azov Brigade has also certainly been deployed in this sector for the past month and a half, along with the two other brigades mentioned earlier and the 33rd Mech around Novopokrovka, but these days it was announced that it would take part in actions in the Serebrianka Forest near Kreminna. We shall see. The Burevii and Rubizh Brigades have already been active for a long time in the Siversk salient. Chervona Kalyna Brigade is said to have arrived in the Orikhiv sector this week. Elements of Lyut Brigade should be near Bakhmut while Stalevyi Kordon Brigade is supposed to be near Kupyansk. Khartiia Brigade (the last added in the OG) remains undeployed currently.\n\nThe most mysterious brigade is the 88th Mech. In late May, a video had been released by the brigade that was geolocated in the Kupyansk sector, which would have made this brigade the first, among those formed in 2023, to be deployed to the front. Then nothing else was published. Neither Ukrainian nor Russian sources have ever mentioned it as far as I have seen. Their Facebook page has been inactive since June.\n\nThen there is the 13th Jager Brigade of which very little is known about. There is, however, a video on their Facebook page from the last week that would show a team from this brigade in action in the \"northern area of operations\", if the translation is to be trusted. Could they be starting to get experience in the border with the Belgorod Oblast? The 60th Mech Brigade that was the formation deployed in that area would have been seen on several occasions in the second line of Bakhmut in the recent weeks, by the way. Lastly, if what has been published lately is true, the 5th Tank Brigade, the \"ghost brigade\", would be under construction. I call it \"ghost\" because on paper it existed even before February 2022 but was never activated despite several rumors in the last year and a half - the upcoming delivery of Leopard 1A5s in large numbers may have unlocked the situation.",

It would be equivalent to Albert Speer who was Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production - who later served 20 years in prison - coming back to become the chancellor of West Germany and then his grandson would also become the chancellor - longest serving one at that - while making annual pilgrimage to a Nazi shrine.</p>\n</div>",

They cost less than $300 to make, are incapable to be reliably shot down by 95% of the existing SHORAD. FPVs currently are able to strike up to 20 kilometers deep, and this distance grows larger. Even the US force would get savaged by this weapon, especially in those conditions. In the current peer-to-peer combined arms, it is this weapon that deals the most damage per dollar.

So its up to individual commanders to figure out the solutions, organize and execute them. Unfortunately it means that a lot of the effort is wasted piecemeal, without focus, sometime on stuff less efficient or even outright useless.

But they said the slaughter intensified this year in eastern Ukraine and has continued at a steady clip as a nearly three-month-old counteroffensive drags on.\n\n\nRussia\u2019s military casualties, the officials said, are approaching 300,000. The number includes as many as 120,000 deaths and 170,000 to 180,000 injured troops. The Russian numbers dwarf the Ukrainian figures, which the officials put at close to 70,000 killed and 100,000 to 120,000 wounded.\n\nBut Russians outnumber Ukrainians on the battlefield almost three to one, and Russia has a larger population from which to replenish its ranks.\n\nUkraine has around 500,000 troops, including active-duty, reserve and paramilitary troops, according to analysts. By contrast, Russia has almost triple that number, with 1,330,000 active-duty, reserve and paramilitary troops \u2014 most of the latter from the Wagner Group.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s last public estimate of casualties came in November, when Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that more than 100,000 troops on each side had been killed or wounded since the war began in February 2022. At the time, officials said privately that the numbers were closer to 120,000 killed and wounded.\n\nBut that number soared in the winter and spring, as the two countries turned the eastern city of Bakhmut into a killing field. Hundreds of troops were killed or injured a day for many weeks, U.S. officials said. The Russians took heavy casualties, but so too did the Ukrainians as they tried to hold every inch of ground before losing the city in May.\n\nUkrainian troops initially tried to break through dug-in Russian lines with mechanized combined arms formations. Equipped with advanced American weapons, the Ukrainians nonetheless became bogged down in dense Russian minefields under constant fire from artillery and helicopter gunships.\n\nIn the first two weeks of the counteroffensive, as much as 20 percent of the weaponry Ukraine sent to the battlefield was damaged or destroyed, according to U.S. and European officials. The losses included some of the formidable Western fighting machines \u2014 tanks and armored personnel carriers \u2014 that the Ukrainians were counting on to beat back the Russians.\n\nMore significantly, thousands of troops were killed or wounded, officials said.\n\nA senior U.S. official acknowledged the high number of Ukrainian casualties but said combined arms is \u201cvery, very hard.\u201d He added that in recent days, Ukrainian troops have begun to punch through initial rings of Russian defenses.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ukraine has shifted its battlefield tactics, returning to its old ways of wearing down Russian forces with artillery and long-range missiles instead of plunging into minefields under fire.\n\nAmerican officials are worried that Ukraine\u2019s adjustments will race through precious ammunition supplies, which could benefit President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and disadvantage Ukraine in a war of attrition. But Ukrainian commanders decided the pivot reduced casualties and preserved their frontline fighting force.\n\nAmerican officials say they fear that Ukraine has become casualty adverse, one reason it has been cautious about pressing ahead with the counteroffensive. Almost any big push against dug-in Russian defenders protected by minefields would result in huge numbers of losses.\n\nIn just a year and a half, Ukraine\u2019s military deaths have already surpassed the number of American troops who died during the nearly two decades U.S. units were in Vietnam (roughly 58,000) and about equal the number of Afghan security forces killed over the entire war in Afghanistan, from 2001 to 2021 (around 69,000).\n\nThe number of dead and wounded reflects the amount of lethal munitions being expended by both sides. Thousands of rounds of artillery are fired every week, tanks batter buildings, land mines are everywhere and drones hover overhead picking off troops below. When close combat does occur, it resembles the battles of World War I: brutal and often taking place in trenches.\n\nThe numbers also point to a lack of rapid medical care on the frontline. Wounded soldiers are increasingly hard to evacuate given how much artillery and gunfire bookend each engagement. Unlike the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where American forces strictly adhered to evacuating casualties within an hour to a well-stocked medical facility, there is no such capability in Ukraine.\n\nInstead, injured troops are often thrown into any vehicle available or leave the front on foot. In some cases, the wounded and dead are left on the battlefield, because medics are unable to reach them. Hospitals and aid stations are often overwhelmed.\n\nAnd across Ukraine, in big cities and rural villages, almost everyone knows a family that has lost someone in the fighting. Dry flowers from funerals litter quiet roads, and graveyards are filling up in every corner of the country.\n\nThe estimated figures for Ukraine and Russia are based on satellite imagery, communication intercepts, social media and news media dispatches from reporters in the country, as well as official reporting from both governments. Estimates vary, even within the U.S. government.\n\nAccording to Pentagon documents leaked in the spring, Russia had suffered 189,500 to 223,000 casualties, including up to 43,000 killed in action. One document said that as of February, Ukraine had suffered 124,500 to 131,000 casualties, with as many as 17,500 killed in action.\n\nWhile several U.S. officials and one former senior Ukrainian official said about 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died in the conflict so far, other American officials said the number could be lower.\n\nThe estimates vary so widely partly because of Ukraine\u2019s reluctance to disclose its wartime losses even to the American government. U.S. intelligence analysts have also spent much more time focusing on Russian casualties than those of Ukraine, their ally.\n\nRussia analysts say the loss of life is unlikely to deter Mr. Putin. He has no political opposition at home and has framed the war as the kind of struggle the country faced during World War II, when more than eight million Soviet troops died. U.S. officials have said they believe that Mr. Putin can sustain hundreds of thousands of casualties in Ukraine, although higher numbers could cut into his political support.\n\nWhile Mr. Putin appears somewhat reluctant to initiate a widespread mobilization, he has raised the upper age limit for men eligible to be conscripted into the army. And should Russia decide to mobilize more people, its larger population could quickly overwhelm Ukrainian reserves of manpower.\n\nThe troop deaths could have a greater impact for Ukraine in a war that is far from over. And while combatants are dying in droves, the civilians caught between the guns have died in the thousands while millions have been displaced.\n\n\u201cThese are people,\u201d said Evelyn Farkas, a former top Pentagon official for Ukraine who is now the executive director of the McCain Institute.\n\n\u201cUkraine is a democracy, so the loss of lives could have greater political impact,\u201d Dr. Farkas said. \u201cBut even in an autocracy, Vladimir Putin knows that public sentiment can make a difference.\u201d",

But they said the slaughter intensified this year in eastern Ukraine and has continued at a steady clip as a nearly three-month-old counteroffensive drags on.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s military casualties, the officials said, are approaching 300,000. The number includes as many as 120,000 deaths and 170,000 to 180,000 injured troops. The Russian numbers dwarf the Ukrainian figures, which the officials put at close to 70,000 killed and 100,000 to 120,000 wounded.</p>\n\n<p>But Russians outnumber Ukrainians on the battlefield almost three to one, and Russia has a larger population from which to replenish its ranks.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has around 500,000 troops, including active-duty, reserve and paramilitary troops, according to analysts. By contrast, Russia has almost triple that number, with 1,330,000 active-duty, reserve and paramilitary troops \u2014 most of the latter from the Wagner Group.</p>\n\n<p>The Biden administration\u2019s last public estimate of casualties came in November, when Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that more than 100,000 troops on each side had been killed or wounded since the war began in February 2022. At the time, officials said privately that the numbers were closer to 120,000 killed and wounded.</p>\n\n<p>But that number soared in the winter and spring, as the two countries turned the eastern city of Bakhmut into a killing field. Hundreds of troops were killed or injured a day for many weeks, U.S. officials said. The Russians took heavy casualties, but so too did the Ukrainians as they tried to hold every inch of ground before losing the city in May.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian troops initially tried to break through dug-in Russian lines with mechanized combined arms formations.

In terms of the casualty figures, it's not just the Ukrainian ones, but Russian estimates also imply a 1.6-1.7x ratio. The range of casualties/KIA from the leaks in March was fairly tight.

It's a lot of work to capture intercepts at a large scale, translate them, and process them into finished intelligence products. A lot more work than just collecting information on the few hundred people in the most critical positions in the Ukrainian government. The US invests resources in conducting those types of operations against its geopolitical enemies, but they're not so motivated to spin up a large scale program when it comes to something relatively unimportant like verifying Ukrainian casualty figures.

First of all, it's evident simply from reading the article that the information we have available is incomplete, because the 70k figure lacks any qualification with uncertainties at all, whether in the form of error bars, confidence intervals, or even qualitative confidence levels. No official intelligence product would fail to specify the confidence level of the assessment and it is difficult to interpret intelligence without understanding its limitations. These could be very low confidence estimates or very high confidence estimates, but we just don't know. So I don't need to know that the information came from someone working on the Hill to know that what's in front of us is insufficient to support a more detailed analysis of the KIA/WIA ratios. That's clear just from reading the article, which is all over the place with the numbers it reports, and, again, lacks any form of uncertainty metric.\n\nSecond, I also think you can argue that the US intel community and DoD are not much better at these types of analysis than the open source community. Even when IC/DoD analysts have access to better information, compartmentalization means their work is subjected to less debate and scrutiny than a comparable open source analysis. Sometimes things like this sit in a need-to-know stovepipe where only a few people look at it and they miss something big. That phenomenon actually seems to be happening to some degree or another in the DoD pretty much all the time.\n\nMoreover, the IC and DoD do not really have that much of an informational advantage over open source in general anymore.\n\n> The estimated figures for Ukraine and Russia are based on satellite imagery, communication intercepts, social media and news media dispatches from reporters in the country, as well as official reporting from both governments.\n\nAll of that is information available in the open source, except communication intercepts.

Possibly the exact same information, unless they really want to invest a lot of resources in an ELINT program targeting Ukrainian military comms (which would detract from resources available for similar programs targeting the Russians and would potentially open them up to extreme blowback if any of that information leaked and damaged the Ukrainian war effort).

And to the extent that they rely on secret source data, it's often in the form of more timely satellite and drone imagery.

            "body": "Honestly (and if Google translate is accurate enough), this seems like a pretty beige argument that Russia's economic future lies in recouping the population and resources of the USSR through the construction of multilateral economic organizations to rival the EU. Of course, it glosses over where Ukraine fits in that picture, partially because this article is trying to pitch peaceful diplomacy in the former-USSR area instead of conquest, and partially because the question of *why* Ukraine did not peacefully join Putin's EEU goes back to Maidan and, in turn, a pretty frank conclusion that Russia's kleptocratic political system is incompatible with any sort of assent to superpower status.\n\nHowever, the first paragraph is a doozy worth the hype.\n\n>A real empire can only be created in a closed space. Because autarky, that is, closing one's economic space from foreign markets, is the only possible version of full-fledged economic sovereignty, without which no sovereign empire can exist. This statement Alexander Dugin supportsand a reference to the largest economists of the last two centuries - List and Keynes, and the experience of Western countries (USA, Great Britain and Germany) that created their empires.\n\nFirst, the reference to Dugin here is bizarre. Not sure how common it is in Russian media these days, but it surprises me because my impression is that Dugin's influence on Putin has always been overated by western commentators.

Of course, it glosses over where Ukraine fits in that picture, partially because this article is trying to pitch peaceful diplomacy in the former-USSR area instead of conquest, and partially because the question of <em>why</em> Ukraine did not peacefully join Putin&#39;s EEU goes back to Maidan and, in turn, a pretty frank conclusion that Russia&#39;s kleptocratic political system is incompatible with any sort of assent to superpower status.</p>\n\n<p>However, the first paragraph is a doozy worth the hype.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A real empire can only be created in a closed space. Because autarky, that is, closing one&#39;s economic space from foreign markets, is the only possible version of full-fledged economic sovereignty, without which no sovereign empire can exist.

If the US or any other nation puts troops in Ukraine and the Russians invade anyway then it's WWIII and that's not a risk these other countries were willing to take over a country that wasn't in NATO. \n\nBiden had been very clear on that in the run up. He laid out all the intelligence they had, made some commitments for weapons shipments, but had been clear that there would be no direct intervention. From a interview 11 days before the invasion:\n\n\n>  In an interview with American broadcaster NBC, Biden said about Russia: \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re dealing with a terrorist organization. We\u2019re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It\u2019s a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly.\u201d\n> \n>  Biden added that there was not a scenario in which the U.S. government could be prompted to send troops to rescue Americans trying to flee the country in the event of a Russian strike: \u201cThat\u2019s a world war where Americans and Russian start shooting at one another. We\u2019re in a very different world than we\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d\n> \n>    \n> \n>  Biden said the U.S. would not swoop to evacuate Americans in the event of an attack. \u201cHow do you do that? How do you even find them?\u201d Biden said.\n\n\n\nInterestingly this also shows that Biden was cautious about tangling with the Russian armed forces. This was back before the fact they were a paper tiger was exposed to all the world.\n\n\nedit:\n\nThe memory of Afghanistan was also still raw.

If the US or any other nation puts troops in Ukraine and the Russians invade anyway then it&#39;s WWIII and that&#39;s not a risk these other countries were willing to take over a country that wasn&#39;t in NATO. </p>\n\n<p>Biden had been very clear on that in the run up. He laid out all the intelligence they had, made some commitments for weapons shipments, but had been clear that there would be no direct intervention. From a interview 11 days before the invasion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In an interview with American broadcaster NBC, Biden said about Russia: \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re dealing with a terrorist organization. We\u2019re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It\u2019s a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Biden added that there was not a scenario in which the U.S. government could be prompted to send troops to rescue Americans trying to flee the country in the event of a Russian strike: \u201cThat\u2019s a world war where Americans and Russian start shooting at one another. We\u2019re in a very different world than we\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Biden said the U.S. would not swoop to evacuate Americans in the event of an attack. \u201cHow do you do that? How do you even find them?\u201d Biden said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly this also shows that Biden was cautious about tangling with the Russian armed forces. This was back before the fact they were a paper tiger was exposed to all the world.</p>\n\n<p>edit:</p>\n\n<p>The memory of Afghanistan was also still raw. What if the US pumps in heavy equipment and then it turns out the majority of Ukrainians are actually sympathetic to Putin, or at least even if not sympathetic they&#39;re not willing to fight either, and Ukraine easily falls. Worse, what if the US or other nations put in troops, the Russians cross the borders, people legit welcome them, and then they are barreling down on wherever the troops are stationed.</p>\n</div>",

If Ukraine does as you are recommending and gives whatever concessions are demanded to get a peace treaty \"right now\", then that would almost certainly mean lacking any outside guarantees. \n\nConsidering that the country invading Ukraine has in the past 10 years: \n\nInvaded and annexed part of the country (Crimea),\n\nSparked off a civil war and then sent both substantial military equipment and active military combatants from the Russian army to seize another part of the country (Donbass),\n\nand launched a full scale invasion of the country (Feb 2022 invasion), \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI doubt that Russia will be trusted to not go for round 4+ without outside guarantees. That loss of trust is especially notable because in each of the three cases mentioned prior, the Russian head of state was making public statements that the Russian army was not involved, or in the case of the full scale invasion, that there was not any risk of an invasion, and any statements to the contrary were \"fearmongering\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I result, I think that your statement of \"It's over.

If Ukraine does as you are recommending and gives whatever concessions are demanded to get a peace treaty &quot;right now&quot;, then that would almost certainly mean lacking any outside guarantees. </p>\n\n<p>Considering that the country invading Ukraine has in the past 10 years: </p>\n\n<p>Invaded and annexed part of the country (Crimea),</p>\n\n<p>Sparked off a civil war and then sent both substantial military equipment and active military combatants from the Russian army to seize another part of the country (Donbass),</p>\n\n<p>and launched a full scale invasion of the country (Feb 2022 invasion), </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I doubt that Russia will be trusted to not go for round 4+ without outside guarantees. That loss of trust is especially notable because in each of the three cases mentioned prior, the Russian head of state was making public statements that the Russian army was not involved, or in the case of the full scale invasion, that there was not any risk of an invasion, and any statements to the contrary were &quot;fearmongering&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As I result, I think that your statement of &quot;It&#39;s over. It&#39;s time to push for talks instead. Come back to this comment in several years when Ukraine has made no progress and reluctantly returns to the negotiating table. We could skip the bloodshed but no one wants to push for that.&quot; is at best relying on highly questionable cases.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Assuming that &quot;it is over, it is time to push for talks&quot; relies on what I believe to be highly questionable assumptions regarding what will happen militarily in the future, the agreements that would result from the aforementioned talks, and the trustworthiness of the Russian government to uphold those agreements.</p>\n</div>",

The other thing is that Russia is very self dependent on everything (oil, food, fertilizer, energy, etc.) so even though the dollae to ruble is bad, their economy won&#39;t be hit too hard unless they increase import.</p>\n</div>",
