We Just Can\u2019t Build It.\nAmerica\u2019s industrial base struggles to ramp up defense production while China\u2019s churns out ever more weapons\n\n>U.S. military spending was 3.1% of gross domestic product in the last fiscal year, near the lowest since World War II. Add the $106 billion President Biden has requested in aid primarily for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and the total would still be less than the 4.6% spent at the peak of Iraq and Afghanistan operations in 2010, never mind the 8.9% in 1968, during the Vietnam War. Healthcare, pensions and interest on the debt really do menace the nation\u2019s finances; military outlays don\u2019t.\n\n>The problem is that even when money\u2019s available, the munitions and weapons are difficult to deliver. In May of 2022, Biden and Lockheed Martin\npromised to double production of Javelin antitank missiles by 2024. That has been pushed back to 2026. The U.S. announced the sale of Harpoon antiship missiles to Taiwan in 2020. They might not be delivered until 2026. Because the U.S. builds just over one nuclear submarine a year, some legislators worry it will take too long to replace those the U.S. will sell to Australia under Aukus, a technology-sharing pact that includes the U.K. \n\n...\n\n>It isn\u2019t just defense; the entire U.S. manufacturing base shrank as labor-intensive production migrated to East Asia. There are fewer suppliers, factories, shipyards and, most important, workers available to meet the rising demand.\n\n>True, civilian and military capacity aren\u2019t perfect substitutes; defense products often require specialized systems and skills. That makes the shortfall even more severe. It could take three to five years to train a welder to work on a submarine, said Ronald O\u2019Rourke, an analyst at the Congressional Research Service.\n\n>Echoing the quality problems U.S. manufacturers of semiconductors, autos and airliners have experienced, defense manufacturers suffer from endemic cost overruns and delays. On average, a new lead ship costs 40% more than the Navy first estimates, the CBO says. Delivery times for submarines have grown to nine years from six.\n\n\n...\n\n>China\u2019s weapons are typically inferior to their U.S. counterparts; its nuclear submarines, for example, are noisier. But as military types like to say, quantity has a quality all its own. And the quality gap is closing.\n\n>It would cost a fortune for the U.S. to rebuild its entire civilian industry base solely to serve the military, and it might not even work. Cook said the Pentagon could instead pay contractors to maintain excess capacity and parts inventories, or use the capacity of allies such as South Korea and Japan (the world\u2019s second- and third-largest shipbuilders, respectively, after China).\n\n>Alternatively, U.S. manufacturers could learn from space launches, which like weapons systems, were plagued by delays and high costs. Then SpaceX came along. Founder Elon Musk ignored any NASA or Pentagon requirements he considered unnecessary, biographer Walter Isaacson has written. Musk sought cheap, mass-produced substitutes for costly specialized parts, such as a valve that cost about 30 times more than the automobile equivalent. SpaceX has helped slash the cost of space launches.\n\n>CRS\u2019s O\u2019Rourke said the Musk of shipbuilding was Henry Kaiser, who used mass-production techniques during World War II to slash the time it took to build a freighter. One way to emulate Kaiser and Musk, he said, would be to \u201cmake the Navy more standardized, modular and designed to be a kit of parts, so that standardized components feed into standardized systems that can be installed on standardized hull designs.\u201d\n\n>He also points to South Korea, whose builders, drawing on civilian experience, design warships with construction and maintenance costs in mind. South Korea\u2019s Aegis missile-defense-equipped destroyer weighs more than the U.S. equivalent, but that actually reduces cost by easing access for workers who install the complex electronics, O\u2019Rourke said.\n\n>To build a bigger military, the key might be learning to build it more cheaply. \n\n\nIf you have access to the article, there are a few nice graphs. Ship launches US vs China per year and US Military spending as percentage of GDP since 1963.\n\n\nA good question for this sub, how can the US military be a better customer for military supplies?

Put them in Kyiv. Yeah, it's a big ask resource wise, but if you were to integrate them effectively with Ukrainian units you give Russia a reason to be a lot more hesitant with who and where they strike.

You outline that Ukraine invited US troops to promote border stability, they don't get involved in the civil war but they're there to ensure that Russia either doesn't invade or deters an invasion. Russia can hem and haw all they want, but they aren't risking a war with the US.

With people like Putin you have to stand up to them, but if you're willing to do this you have to be willing to back up your bark.

They interviewed some of the brass in the Brazilian army anonymously and these are the key take-aways:\n\n* Despite the action, the understanding today in the Army is that Maduro\u2019s attitude towards an annexation of part of Guyana - the Essequibo region, equivalent to almost 70% of the Guyanese territory - is a political bluff, with an eye on the presidential elections of 2024.\n* The border of Venezuela and Guyana has few inhabitants and is marked by an area of dense forest, which makes it almost impossible to move large troops from one country to another, in the view of the Brazilian Army. Therefore, an action would have to take place through the Brazilian territory.\n* Analyses made in the Brazilian Army point to a problem of staff on the part of the Venezuelan Army, with poor working conditions among the base ranks. These same evaluations consider that the Army and Air Force have, however, good military equipment.\n* The same does not happen with the Navy, considered the most scrapped Force in Venezuela. Therefore, an occupation by sea is considered more unlikely from a military point of view. In addition, the coast of Guyana is considered difficult to access.\n\n(All of the above are direct translations from the article made with Bing translator)\n\nThe article also has a nice chart comparing both countries' military equipment and personnel, which I recommend accessing. Basically, Guyana's entire military personnel is basically a brigade (3500 men) vs. Venezuela's 125k men. Guyanese equipment consists of a negligible number of armored cars, 3 choppers, some 54 artillery pieces and 5 patrol boats.\n\nTo its defensive advantage, is the very dense jungle terrain of the Amazon and little to no road infrastructure to facilitate armored advance. That's why the Brazilian army notes the possibility of an invasion through Brazil, which actually maintains a roads that connects Venezuela and Guyana through the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous reserve in the State of Roraima. Though the risk of a Venezuelan invasion of Brazil is considered very low by the same sources, given Lula's relationship with Maduro. The second best option would be through sea, but the Venezuelan navy is poorly equipped and maintained to support such an operation, also posing a considerable logistical challenge.\n\nSo yeah. The Brazilian army seems to consider this saber-rattling with an actual invasion bein an unlikely possibility.\n\n**As a bit o personal commentary:**\n\nI understand the logistical problems Venezuela faces in an invasion. Georgetown is very far away from the Venezuelan border and the disputed territory consists mostly of Dense jungle dotted with small villages and settlements. I can see the Venezuelan navy threatening the coastal capital to force Guyana's capitulation. I can also envisage a successful an actual successful guerrilla resistance, depending on how strongly the Guyanese feel about the territory, because I think it is unlikely Venezuela would have the logistics to support attrition in deep jungle operations for long.\n\nA Brazilian intervention is unlikely because Lula's foreign policy has been one of proximity to anti-American players. In fact, his party's single most consistent foreign policy stance has been one of anti-Americanism and Lula, until recently largely considered more pragmatic, has taken a more ideological turn and has not seemed to deviate significantly from that. Though I don't think he'd go as far as allowing Venezuelan troops to cross Brazilian territory (though I also do not think it as unlikely as some would), he will likely not intervene in any considerable way if Venezuela invades.\n\nOn the other hand, I think that it would not be too hard to dissuade Venezuela. Some international troops stationed in Guyana or a few boats patrolling the coast would probably be enough to discourage Maduro from any adventures, but the will to do that is beyond what I can assess or predict.",

A third, who had been convicted of murder three times, poured gasoline on his sleeping sister and burned her alive, according to the court\u2019s press office. </p>\n\n<p>The offenses committed by the convict soldiers risk shattering Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s narrative that the war protects Russia from its enemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Analysts(most notably Dara Massicot) have repeatedly raised concerns about the long-term consequences of the Kremlin&#39;s decision to introduce penal battalions. It seems that those concerns are at least partially bearing fruit. Poor reintegration of convicts and regular veterans alike is going to reverberate across Russia&#39;s society and culture for decades.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Some news on the industrial side of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis morning the Ukrainian military observers Mashovets and Kovalenko both reported the estimates of Ukrainian military intelligence about the production at the \"State Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building Bakhirev\" located in Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. It's by far the main factory in Russia for the production of shells. \n\nIn 2024 there are reportedly plans to produce, from this plant:\n\n- 60k 203mm artillery shells (almost three times as much as planned in 2023);\n- 684k 152mm artillery shells (18% more than planned for 2023);\n- 270k 125mm tank ammos (an increase of nearly 14% over the current year);\n- 253k 122mm artillery shells (just a 5% increase).\n\nhttps://t. me/zvizdecmanhustu/1459\n\nhttps://t. me/zloyodessit/20579\n\n\nIn general, the Russian military command expects to receive nearly a third more new shells produced from its military-industrial complex in 2024 compared to 2023, although it's said that the growth in 2024 could stop at a quarter. Russia's shells production capacity is judged to be between 1,5 and 1,7 million shells per year (not clear whether this includes tank ammos). The very large increase in 203mm shells production is clearly due to the withdrawal of howitzers of this caliber from depots and the ongoing creation of the new high-power artillery brigades. It's also reported that the \"Precision Electromechanics Plant\" near Minsk in Belarus is working to fulfill an order for 10k units of 122mm unguided rockets for BM-21 Grads, for the Russian Armed Forces.\n\nMashovets also reports that the Black Sea Fleet has recently received (it reportedly just arrived in Novorossiysk) a Karakurt-class \"Tucha\" missile corvette (capable of accommodating up to 8 Kalibr-NKs), manufactured by Zelenodolsk Shipyard in Tatarstan and arrived via the Volga-Don channel. It would be on trials and will replace the \"Askold\" corvette that was damaged by a Ukrainian missile attack a month ago.\n\nThe Russian \"Military Informant\" Telegram channel reports that there's a possibility that mass production of 122mm shells for Ukraine has begun in Azerbaijan. It's not certain that the pictures are from there, but there are several clues: one is suggested in the post. Another might be the fact that in a photo in [this article](https://ukrainetoday.org/they-work-in-three-shifts-ukraine-has-established-production-of-122-mm-shells-in-one-of-the-partner-countries/), reporting the start of 122mm shells production in a partner country of Ukraine, there is a \"NetLift\" stacker (a Turkish company), which might be indeed another clue, given the high presence of Turkish equipment in the Transcaucasian country. Thanks to the production, primarily from the East EU countries, but also from Pakistan and potentially new partners like this one, 122mm shells are the second most used artillery caliber in the UAF after the 155mm, and in fact the 2S1 Gvozdikas and D-30s equip an important part of the artillery battalions of Ukrainian brigades. Whereas the situation for 152mm (and Western 105mm caliber) ammunition is much worse.\n\nhttps://t. me/milinfolive/112013",

It&#39;s by far the main factory in Russia for the production of shells. </p>\n\n<p>In 2024 there are reportedly plans to produce, from this plant:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>60k 203mm artillery shells (almost three times as much as planned in 2023);</li>\n<li>684k 152mm artillery shells (18% more than planned for 2023);</li>\n<li>270k 125mm tank ammos (an increase of nearly 14% over the current year);</li>\n<li>253k 122mm artillery shells (just a 5% increase).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/zvizdecmanhustu/1459</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/zloyodessit/20579</p>\n\n<p>In general, the Russian military command expects to receive nearly a third more new shells produced from its military-industrial complex in 2024 compared to 2023, although it&#39;s said that the growth in 2024 could stop at a quarter. Russia&#39;s shells production capacity is judged to be between 1,5 and 1,7 million shells per year (not clear whether this includes tank ammos). The very large increase in 203mm shells production is clearly due to the withdrawal of howitzers of this caliber from depots and the ongoing creation of the new high-power artillery brigades. It&#39;s also reported that the &quot;Precision Electromechanics Plant&quot; near Minsk in Belarus is working to fulfill an order for 10k units of 122mm unguided rockets for BM-21 Grads, for the Russian Armed Forces.</p>\n\n<p>Mashovets also reports that the Black Sea Fleet has recently received (it reportedly just arrived in Novorossiysk) a Karakurt-class &quot;Tucha&quot; missile corvette (capable of accommodating up to 8 Kalibr-NKs), manufactured by Zelenodolsk Shipyard in Tatarstan and arrived via the Volga-Don channel. It would be on trials and will replace the &quot;Askold&quot; corvette that was damaged by a Ukrainian missile attack a month ago.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian &quot;Military Informant&quot; Telegram channel reports that there&#39;s a possibility that mass production of 122mm shells for Ukraine has begun in Azerbaijan. It&#39;s not certain that the pictures are from there, but there are several clues: one is suggested in the post. Another might be the fact that in a photo in <a href=\"https://ukrainetoday.org/they-work-in-three-shifts-ukraine-has-established-production-of-122-mm-shells-in-one-of-the-partner-countries/\">this article</a>, reporting the start of 122mm shells production in a partner country of Ukraine, there is a &quot;NetLift&quot; stacker (a Turkish company), which might be indeed another clue, given the high presence of Turkish equipment in the Transcaucasian country. Thanks to the production, primarily from the East EU countries, but also from Pakistan and potentially new partners like this one, 122mm shells are the second most used artillery caliber in the UAF after the 155mm, and in fact the 2S1 Gvozdikas and D-30s equip an important part of the artillery battalions of Ukrainian brigades. Whereas the situation for 152mm (and Western 105mm caliber) ammunition is much worse.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/milinfolive/112013</p>\n</div>",
