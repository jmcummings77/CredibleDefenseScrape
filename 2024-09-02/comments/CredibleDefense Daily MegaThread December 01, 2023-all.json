Caracas must also begin releasing Venezuelan political prisoners and \"wrongfully detained\" Americans, the spokesperson added.\n\n>The State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment after the statement was published.\n\n\nThis step would argue against an imminent invasion. If you're a skeptic, you could argue this is just buying time for more sanctions relief as the U.S. citizens wrongly held in Venezuela haven't been released yet, and the court could just as easily reject Machado's candidacy. But, it's still a concession that a belligerent would not have to grant, hinting far more strongly towards the Guyana issue being a political red herring.

Next year, for the <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-emissions-set-to-fall-in-2024-after-record-growth-in-clean-energy/\">first time</a>, growth in solar will be higher than growth in power demand, which means that China will have to shut down something else. This won&#39;t be renewables or nuclear. Furthermore, batteries are also <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/storage-developers-predict-more-growth-as-battery-costs-fall-again\">falling</a>, and even gas peakers have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/giant-batteries-drain-economics-gas-power-plants-2023-11-21/\">trouble</a> competing.</p>\n\n<p>Since Russia is doing absolutely nothing to diversify its economy, unlike the Gulf states which are at least trying, an economic decline is inevitable. Now the question is if Ukraine can keep fighting for so long. Because Russia won&#39;t.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": ">My question is, does Ukraine have a manpower issue in the traditional sense or do they have a mobilization issue?\n\nAs hatesranged said, both.\n\nThey have the ability to enlarge their mobilization pool greatly, but they won't for political reasons. The issue is that existing pool is becoming greatly limited. Not tapped out, but they're not making the numbers. And their conscription system frankly sucks.\n\nUkraine historically suffers from draft dodging. It was prevalent back in the Soviet Union. Back in the 90s and 2000s when the Ukrainian Armed Forces was a notoriously corrupt and poorly funded organization, military service wasn't popular. The UAF briefly ended conscription in 2013 because it was so unpopular but were forced to reinstate it in 2014 at the start of the Donbas War. Draft dodging continued to the start of this war, and when demands expanded after the war started, so did the efforts of draft dodgers. Simply put, a large number of Ukrainian military aged males do not want to serve in the military. That's probably not going to end, especially since conscription was done rather poorly in this war,,\n\nTo fix it won't be easy or popular. And that's the biggest issue, because up until recently the Ukrainians were the ones who were actually largely using a shadow mobilization too, hiding the fact that they were conscripting men by the hundreds of thousands under the veil that the war was popular and that overall societal morale was good. Which it largely was, which was also part of the problem. They built a system that only kind of worked under \"the times of plenty,\" when everything was fine and they were winning. During meatgrinder campaigns and now with strategic setbacks, the flawed system shows serious defects. \n\nDefinitely not impossible to fix. First, they need to expand the pool of potential draftees. Right now there are lots of stupid deferments they can get rid of (like anyone registered in college is referred, which was exploited by tens of thousands of middle aged men who suddenly signed up for college since the war started). They can also lower the draft age from 25 to 18. Maybe remove stipulations involving family situations. And maybe conscript women, who are thus far allowed to serve to include in combat arms positions but only as volunteers. That can open up hundreds of thousands of new prospective troops.\n\nThey also need to be more efficient in conscripting. The recruitment command was notoriously corrupt, Zelensky ended up mass firing the lot of them back in mid August over allegations of bribery and other charges. But that was probably a bad move, because the replacements don't really seem to know what they're doing and are themselves very fearful of making mistakes considering they'll be on the chopping block next.\n\nNot only do they need to successfully recruit troops, but they need to properly train them. The fact that they are still getting minimally trained almost two years in to this war is criminal almost, that realistically leads to higher casualties (requiring more replacements) but also effects the chances of success. Ukraine society knows they aren't getting the training they need, fix that and it lessens the feelings among some that they are cannon fodder.\n\nSo fix recruitment and training, but then they need to work on better maintaining of troops. Because they can't afford to pay them better and equipping them better is largely out of their control, there isn't much much the Ukrainians can do in this regard other than tackle corruption and incompetence in the military and govt. Like the scandal about military cold weather equipment graft that led to Reznikov getting fired, or cheap tourniquets leading to the chief or UAF medical corps getting fired, avoid those scandals in the first place. \n\nAs the recruitment pool expands, and if they fix the recruitment system, training, and maintenance, the overall pool of draft dodgers will still increase too. It's just systemic at this point. So the UA govtneed to reform their ability to conscript the unwilling more successfully. Part of that can be fixed by institutional reforms to the UAF to make it more appealing (see above), better propaganda especially using shame (like the British White Feather campaign), but they still need to better round up the draft dodgers. That'll mean going back and reevaluating many tens of thousands to find out who falsified medical records or used bribery in the past. Finding those who are in hiding. Etc. And they need to convict and imprison those who refuse. \n\nNote, that isn't necessary specifically because those individuals are so desperately needed, but to show that their criminal behavior won't be tolerated. Not only is it a challenge to the state, it's a big slap in the face to those who do allow themselves to be conscripted. The Ukrainian need to keep the patriotic motivated, and that's not going to happen if they go out of their way to provide indulgences to the non-patriotic. Sacrifice needs to be universal or it's not fair, and unfair leads to bad morale. \n\nThese are my opinions based on a lifetime of studying warfare, ancient to modern. Ukraine absolutely doesn't need to recreate the wheel to fight this war. What works and what doesn't is already pretty well known at this point, copy what works and discard what doesn't.",

It still needs to 1) grow in size and staff new units, 2) replace casualties in existing units, and 3) relieve veterans in existing units who have been fighting since the war even started (this is going to be a long war, they NEED to plan this ASAP).\n\nIf they don't expand their manpower pool it limits how many that can get. So they can't do all three of those things, and probably not even two of them, and potentially not even one of them. Right now they are having lots of trouble doing 1) and 2), while they are acknowledging that they need to do 3) as well.\n\nThat's not sustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>How many 18-25 year old men and young women can you lose before the nation you seek to defend no longer has a future?\n\nJudging by other wars in the past, probably a lot of them. But remember, military service doesn't mean death and that feeling is largely the reason that recruitment suffers.\\*\n\nConsidering that the current dearth of UA young adults was previously caused by labor migration following the collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent economic woes, would Ukraine rather lose even more as refugees fleeing this war as it gets worse and its economy suffers? Or following the Ukraine zeitgeist, live in Ukraine having to suffer the ramifications of an unfavorable peace deal with Putin?\n\nIf it's truly a People's War and a victory to get them just their minimalist goals (return to prewar borders), let alone their maximalist goals (get everything back), then they need to step up and do whatever is needed. Anything less means future resistance is largely futile and even more costly.\n\nIf they aren't willing to sacrifice their future, they need to end the war ASAP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*In my opinion, the UA govt has been irresponsible with its troops. While not nearly as bad as the Russians, and despite this type of war being very costly in casualties, the UAF regularly volunteers to fight extremely costly meatgrinder battles largely for political reasons, which it routinely loses too making the losses even less palatable.\n\nTo fix recruitment they need to fix the perception that their troops, **especially** the infantry, aren't cannon fodder who are going to serve on the front lines indefinitely until they are dead or severely wounded. And that requires a major expanded mobilization plan.\n\nWhy are the Ukrainians still barely training their troops? 644 days later and their junior enlisted are getting 5 weeks of training or less sometimes. Not much better for their newly commissioned officers either. Not training their field grade officers either Why?\n\nBecause they \"need\" them ASAP in the fight.\n\nPart of that need comes from their ridiculously high OPTEMPO, but the other part is that they don't have enough manpower, so excess training is viewed as a waste of time. Every day they aren't fighting, they aren't fighting. \n\nTo fix that, they need to recruit more troops, specifically to have more in their their pipeline at any given time and regularly finishing training that is of sufficient quality, and that will ease up the personnel shortfalls in the combat units driving the expedited training outside of occasional unplanned emergencies. \n\nUnfuck that, and five weeks of training becomes ten or more (militaries in conditions far worse than Ukraine did way more than 10 weeks), the result is troops who are more competent and confident, whose effectiveness and morale improves, that leads to less casualties and higher mission success, which leads to more battles won and campaigns won. \n\nWith troops go into the fight knowing their involuntary service obligation is limited too, their morale is higher, but more so, the morale of prospective draftees is higher, who no longer think military service is a death sentence.\n\nNot easy to sell to the general public but critical to keep the war going indefinitely.

There are two main benefits to Russian control of Ukraine from what I've read and watched.\n\nFirst is economic. Russia's biggest-by-far export to wealthy countries was oil & gas. As an SSR Ukraine allowed the Soviets to build pipelines to the West across Ukrainian land. After gaining independence Ukr started charging Russia for using those pipelines. When Ukraine's government changed from Russia-oriented to Europe-oriented in the 2010s that posed a strategis threat to Russia's oil income if Ukraine saw fit to interrupt the flow. Then Ukraine discovered massive reserves of oil and gas in its east and off the Crimean coast not long before the initial \"uprisings\" in Luhansk & Donetsk. Enough oil & gas to tank Russia's economy for good if it were exploited by a government not under Russia's control.\n\nSecond is militarily strategic. Russia, like most major governments, likes having the ability to fight their enemies on land that's not their own. So the prospect of Ukraine joining the EU or NATO is intensely problematic and would allow \"hostile\" troops too close to Moscow for Russia's liking. Since Ukraine's government started aligning itself with the West in the 2010s, it seems the Russian govenment was compelled to disrupt that trend, because personal power is more important than effective, popular governance.\n\nLooking at either of these perspectives explains the Ukraine war as a pre-emptive attack to ensure Russia's continued power without the government having to actually develop the country, invest in its people, or reduce the personal power of the people in charge.\n\nI get a fair portion of my info on Ukraine from The Caspian Report & William Spaniel\n\nhttps://youtube.com/@CaspianReport?si=4g5NYwqKhjpcoHRf\n\nhttps://youtube.com/@Gametheory101?si=4N-oQVyAt40xGh2Y",

Much more so than being seen by a radar, because there's no attenuation from the reflection, and the path distance isn't doubled by reflection. (That is to say, imagine shining a torch at a person in a field versus seeing somebody in a field holding a torch. You'll see the torch from a much greater distance than you'd see the person with your own torch.)\n\nSo, lots of times you just don't want to use the radar... which leads to the question \"so how do stealth jets know what to shoot at?\".\n\nYou can get targetting information sent to the aircraft over a radio tactical data link (TDL). The F-35 uses a data link called MADL which is designed to be hard to intercept (LPI or Low Probability of Intercept), reducing the chance that the radio emissions from the data link identify the aircraft. However, the most common NATO standard tactical data link is \"Link 16\", which isn't designed for LPI (there are many other Link-NN standards for different purposes, such as different radio frequencies and data types). That targetting information can come from many sources; AWACS, other attack aircraft that stay in lower threat areas using their radar, UAVs, ships, ground radar.\n\nAnother technology used for detecting aircraft is using passive infrared search and track (IRST), which is essentially just a camera (and a bunch of optics, electronics and software) that scans for the heat signature of other aircraft against the cold sky. Examples are EOTS on the F35 and PIRATE on the Typhoon and the podded AN/ASG-34A for the F-18 Rhino.\n\nA third approach, which has very little public information, is passive radar. The most modern radars such as the AN/APG-81 are publically advertised as having \"long-range active and passive air-to-air and air-to-ground modes\". This implies that they can receive radar reflections from third party emitters to gather information. That could be \"co-operative\" or \"non-cooperative\".\n\nIn the former the radar emitter is linked with the receiver, so your radar transmitter can be further back from the threat, but the receiver knows what pulses are being transmitted on what frequency and timing, thus gets a very good radar picture (and much greater situational awareness). This is actually how the earliest WW2 ground radars worked, with separate transmitters and receivers.\n\nNon-cooperative passive radar means there is no link, so the radar receiver is just observing what electromagnetic emissions are around and trying to discern information from that. It has been demonstrated using non-radar radio emissions such as cellular traffic, TV and radio broadcast. Essentially, you can see there's a strong emitter \"over there\", and notice that there's similar weaker signals also coming from \"over there\", and infer that it's a radar return.",

Especially after the first evacuation calls and then the ground operation started Israel has no way of knowing who exactly is currently in a building. </p>\n\n<p>There are also some logical gaps in the story.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why, then, after nearly two months, has the Israeli army not yet run out of targets in the current war?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t run out of targets in a war. Hamas still has infrastructure to launch rockets, you hit that. Hamas likely still has weapons depots, yo hit that. And Hamas has attack teams and positions, you hit that. There are also more than enough tunnels which Israel is currently destroying &quot;by hand&quot; and not airstrike. </p>\n\n<p>Also their idea to cleanly separate targets according to categories falls flat even in their own article. At the end they start admitting that Hamas infrastructure is deeply intertwined with civilian infrastructure</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hamas militants regularly operate out of an intricate network of tunnels built under large stretches of the Gaza Strip. These tunnels, as confirmed by the former Israeli intelligence officers we spoke to, also pass under homes and roads.  </p>\n\n<p>The intelligence officers interviewed for this article said that the way Hamas designed the tunnel network in Gaza knowingly exploits the civilian population and infrastructure above ground. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One other problem is assessing the result of Israeli strikes according to proportionality. We don&#39;t actually know the make up of casualties in Gaza. How many Hamas militants were killed? We don&#39;t know. How many Hamas militants were killed and labeled civilians? We don&#39;t know. How many Hamas militants are rotting in tunnels hit by airstrikes? We don&#39;t know.</p>\n</div>",
