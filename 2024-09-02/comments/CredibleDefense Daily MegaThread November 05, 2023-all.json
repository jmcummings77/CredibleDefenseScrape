That means that there would be no aid to Ukraine for soldiers' salaries; to pay the extra costs for training and services (like intel); to help stabilize Ukraine's budget, or for any humanitarian assistance. That amount is right the same as the security assistance. \n3. Equipment has to be produced at the US's expense upfront. All new equipment must be paid for to be made, and existing equipment paid to be refurbished back to like new as well as having any sensitive tech replaced, before sending it. That's money getting spent out of the budget that doesn't come back to the Defense budget, unlike PDA funding.

You've got a soviet style massive reserve to either fill the front with and achieve dominance....or at least replace heavy losses sustainability through multi-year conflicts.

I mean, he's probably got two hands on the flag....\n\n>But I don't think anyone is claiming here that Hamas launching rockets from behind a hospital makes the hospital not a hospital, right?\n\nNo, you're right. If they're dragging the rockets from some warehouse somewhere, shooting them off next to the hospital and scooting, I don't think that'd count as perfidy. Thats a hospital that had some rockets fired from next to it.\n\nBut if you build a military base full of rockets and the men manning them *under a hospital* for the express purpose of making that target *invulnerable due to humanitarian law against bombing hospitals* thats perfidy. \n\nYou are deliberately, and pre-meditatively, using humanitarian law in known bad faith, to shield your valid military targets. If you kill opposing force members from that location... the protections of humanitarian law do not apply to strikes on that target. \n\nAs with our \"shoot at the guys under the white flag if your surrender accepting party is fired upon\" something that would normally be impermissable is permissable.\n\nIt has to be so. \n\nThe alternative is that \"every military in the world builds a fucking great hospital on top of any military base they want to protect\".\n\nEnforcement of *allowing attacks on perfidious targets* is essential to ensuring that militaries are not incentivised to do it.... which would endanger more civilians over time.\n\nIts only working for Hamas because *world opinion doesn't give a crap what the law is*. They just see bombed hospitals. The fact that there is no actual legal repurcussion is immaterial. \n\n>There are wounded and civilians in that hospital, and the prohibition on human shields explicitly states that it doesn't eliminate an adversary's obligations with regard to proportionality.\n\nYes, but there are a lot less in hospitals over military bases today.... than there would be if international law held they were a perfectly invulnerable shield over your most critical military infrastructure. \n\nYou can have different views morally, but legally.... Those aren't civilians in a civilian hospital. They are deliberate human shields placed on a military base to use international law for perfidy. Just as if Hamas strapped a wounded civilian on the front of every toyota hilux technical and drove around daring Israel to fire at them.\n\nOr.... more topically.... if they drove around Gaza deploying ATGM squads from Ambulances mixed among lots of genuinely civilian ambulances.\n\n>I don't think there's a way to operate among the bad faith war crimes of Hamas without altering the proportionality obligations, but your perfidy argument here seems to suggest they don't exist at all.\n\nYes, I think thats right. I think deliberate perfidy changes the legal (but not moral) requirement of proportionality.\n\nIf it didn't.... then you could make your military invulnerable. Create a situation where to attack any part of it is a war crime.\n\n*Politician: Sooooo.... Whats the proportional number of civilians for a tank ?*\n\nLawyer: I think we'd say 4 or 5 civilians\n\n*Politician So if we strap 6 civilians to the tank they can't shoot a us without it being a war crime?*\n\nLawyer: Yeeeeees, I guess.\n\n*Politician: Cool. How many for a Brigade Command Centre?*\n\nLawyer: 100?\n\n*Poliician: Hey Mike, get in here. I know where we are going to build the new orphanage.....*",

Thats a hospital that had some rockets fired from next to it.</p>\n\n<p>But if you build a military base full of rockets and the men manning them <em>under a hospital</em> for the express purpose of making that target <em>invulnerable due to humanitarian law against bombing hospitals</em> thats perfidy. </p>\n\n<p>You are deliberately, and pre-meditatively, using humanitarian law in known bad faith, to shield your valid military targets. If you kill opposing force members from that location... the protections of humanitarian law do not apply to strikes on that target. </p>\n\n<p>As with our &quot;shoot at the guys under the white flag if your surrender accepting party is fired upon&quot; something that would normally be impermissable is permissable.</p>\n\n<p>It has to be so. </p>\n\n<p>The alternative is that &quot;every military in the world builds a fucking great hospital on top of any military base they want to protect&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Enforcement of <em>allowing attacks on perfidious targets</em> is essential to ensuring that militaries are not incentivised to do it.... which would endanger more civilians over time.</p>\n\n<p>Its only working for Hamas because <em>world opinion doesn&#39;t give a crap what the law is</em>. They just see bombed hospitals. The fact that there is no actual legal repurcussion is immaterial. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are wounded and civilians in that hospital, and the prohibition on human shields explicitly states that it doesn&#39;t eliminate an adversary&#39;s obligations with regard to proportionality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but there are a lot less in hospitals over military bases today.... than there would be if international law held they were a perfectly invulnerable shield over your most critical military infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p>You can have different views morally, but legally.... Those aren&#39;t civilians in a civilian hospital. They are deliberate human shields placed on a military base to use international law for perfidy. Just as if Hamas strapped a wounded civilian on the front of every toyota hilux technical and drove around daring Israel to fire at them.</p>\n\n<p>Or.... more topically.... if they drove around Gaza deploying ATGM squads from Ambulances mixed among lots of genuinely civilian ambulances.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way to operate among the bad faith war crimes of Hamas without altering the proportionality obligations, but your perfidy argument here seems to suggest they don&#39;t exist at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, I think thats right. I think deliberate perfidy changes the legal (but not moral) requirement of proportionality.</p>\n\n<p>If it didn&#39;t.... then you could make your military invulnerable. Create a situation where to attack any part of it is a war crime.</p>\n\n<p><em>Politician: Sooooo.... Whats the proportional number of civilians for a tank ?</em></p>\n\n<p>Lawyer: I think we&#39;d say 4 or 5 civilians</p>\n\n<p><em>Politician So if we strap 6 civilians to the tank they can&#39;t shoot a us without it being a war crime?</em></p>\n\n<p>Lawyer: Yeeeeees, I guess.</p>\n\n<p><em>Politician: Cool. How many for a Brigade Command Centre?</em></p>\n\n<p>Lawyer: 100?</p>\n\n<p><em>Poliician: Hey Mike, get in here. I know where we are going to build the new orphanage.....</em></p>\n</div>",

How Ukraine acted in defense of \"little green men\" versus the most recent war is significantly different, and so is its capabilities.   \n\n\nIt's true that without western commitment Ukraine will fall, and whether or not that will happen (but more realistically to what degree) is a separate topic, but we can conclusively agree that whatever military capability Russia had three years ago has been grossly reduced. We assumed it was a dominant regional power with the possibility it was a continental power, but that's been since disproven - and it will, no matter the result of the war, be grossly reduced no matter how this ends.

But a dozen millions of Ukranians have grandparrents or great grandparrents that fought heroicaly against an utterly genocidal invasion with a red army uniform, that died due to it, that rebuilt their Soviet Republic from rumble after it and dozens of millions that ,yes, considered themselves Soviets at least as much as Ukrainians,loved their motherland and achieved great things both for Ukraine, the Soviet Union and humanity.</p>\n\n<p>Forgetting those people, pushing them aside in the collective understanding of ukraine&#39;s national mythology that is now being recentered so much so around anti-sovietism that you slowly but surely end up promoting and celebrating over them much more controversial figures and groups with various levels of nazi collaboration or extreme ethnonationalism is a big mistake and a sad affair. And accellerated ironicaly enough by Russian agression, a deeply anti communist country with a rulling elite despising and spitting on the soviet past and sliding deeper into reveration of monarchism and christianic foundementalism</p>\n</div>",

The very existence of Israel on land which Palestinians claim will always provide sufficient grounds for hatred. Increasing hatred a little more does not meaningfully change the situation. Keeping the IDF where it can disarm West Bank militant groups does meaningfully change the situation.\n\n> It's wild to actually find someone who's pro-settlement\n\nA lot of individual settlers are nasty theocrats, but the strategic argument for their presence applies anyway, which is probably why secular and left-wing governments let them move there for the last 50+ years.\n\n> of all the Israeli's I've talked to none of them wanted the settlements.\n\nI don't know much about internal Israeli politics, but this is a conclusion I have reached in the last month due to Israel's border security proving unexpectedly porous.

Money is expected to pour in.\n> *     In a video posted Friday, Tlaib accused Biden of supporting \"genocide\" of Palestinians. \"Mr. President, the American people are not with you on this one,\" she said, looking into the camera after showing scenes of bloodshed in Gaza. \"We will remember in 2024.\"\n> *     Sen.

Many more liberal Democrats are pacifists in general, anti-war in nature, pro-Palestinian in mindset \u2014 and deeply divided over Israel's leadership and Gaza strategy.\n> *     \"My donors are flipping out,\" one leading Democratic official told us. \"They're happy with Biden but angry with the party.\" This Democrat told us that Biden's approach to Israel shows \"resolve and conviction. For voters who think we're weak on immigration and crime, this is the kind of strength they need to see.\"\n> \n> By the numbers: A Quinnipiac Poll out Thursday showed the stark age divide:\n> \n> *     Respondents were asked: \"Do you approve or disapprove of the way Israel is responding to the October 7th Hamas terrorist attack?\"\n> *     Overall, half approved and 35% disapproved. But only 32% of respondents ages 18-34 approved of Israel's response, as opposed to about 58% of those 50+.\n> *     Democrats disapproved of the response by 49%-33%. Three-quarters of Republicans approved, and 46% of independents.\n> \n> Zoom in: Michigan is the state where Democrats have the most to lose over their divisions. It has the largest Arab-American community in the country + a sizable Jewish vote \u2014 and is a presidential swing state, with an open Senate seat.\n> \n> *     The Jewish vote is pivotal for Biden in several big swing states, including Pennsylvania and Georgia, Axios' Josh Kraushaar tells us. \n> \n> The bottom line: Every day is a balancing act for Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. They try to signal support for Israel and signal (or leak) efforts to constrain Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet.\n> \n> *     But Biden knows the scale will tip against him if more Democrats turn sour on America's role.",

But with each passing day, the images and reality of innocent Palestinians, including many kids, getting killed in Israeli bombings of Hamas makes Biden&#39;s job harder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Top officials tell us explaining Israel&#39;s position that Hamas militants use Palestinian civilians as human shields resonates mostly with staunchly pro-Israel Democrats.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>    Biden&#39;s war-planning team is pro-Israel across the board \u2014 but top officials know their own party decidedly isn&#39;t. Many more liberal Democrats are pacifists in general, anti-war in nature, pro-Palestinian in mindset \u2014 and deeply divided over Israel&#39;s leadership and Gaza strategy.</li>\n<li>    &quot;My donors are flipping out,&quot; one leading Democratic official told us. &quot;They&#39;re happy with Biden but angry with the party.&quot; This Democrat told us that Biden&#39;s approach to Israel shows &quot;resolve and conviction. For voters who think we&#39;re weak on immigration and crime, this is the kind of strength they need to see.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By the numbers: A Quinnipiac Poll out Thursday showed the stark age divide:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>    Respondents were asked: &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the way Israel is responding to the October 7th Hamas terrorist attack?&quot;</li>\n<li>    Overall, half approved and 35% disapproved. But only 32% of respondents ages 18-34 approved of Israel&#39;s response, as opposed to about 58% of those 50+.</li>\n<li>    Democrats disapproved of the response by 49%-33%. Three-quarters of Republicans approved, and 46% of independents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Zoom in: Michigan is the state where Democrats have the most to lose over their divisions. It has the largest Arab-American community in the country + a sizable Jewish vote \u2014 and is a presidential swing state, with an open Senate seat.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>    The Jewish vote is pivotal for Biden in several big swing states, including Pennsylvania and Georgia, Axios&#39; Josh Kraushaar tells us. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The bottom line: Every day is a balancing act for Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. They try to signal support for Israel and signal (or leak) efforts to constrain Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war Cabinet.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>    But Biden knows the scale will tip against him if more Democrats turn sour on America&#39;s role.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Large population drain, poor investment, high military budget requirements, low probability to accede into EU - All of it spells instability. *In my opinion* I think Ukraine will become a failed state down the line unless they categorically win against Russia.

They'll need to spend a ton on aid to Ukraine, deal with immigrations from Ukraine, shore itself up for round 2 with Russia.

Ukraine doesn't just get a blank cheque in that regard and plenty of criticism has been levied against them since the war started.   \n\n\nRegardless if OHCHR numbers are to be believed, the civilian death toll is relatively low for a conflict of this scale which means Ukraine is very likely already taking those considerations into account and actively managing the risk to civilians.",
