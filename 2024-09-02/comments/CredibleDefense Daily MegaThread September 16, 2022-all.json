A world in which there should be no cruelty and terrorism. But all this is there. And its name is Russia.\"\n\n>>\"More than 400 bodies were found at the mass burial site in Izium. With signs of torture, children, those killed as a result of missile attacks, warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" Zelensky said.\n\n>>\"Russia leaves only death and suffering,\" he continued, before pledging: \"You won\u2019t run away. You won\u2019t hide. Retribution will be justly dreadful.\"\n\n>As the exhumation continues, it's unclear how each victim died and when. Scores of civilians and soldiers were killed in the weeks-long bombardment of Izium by Russian forces in March and April. A CNN team at the site said that the graves they saw were predominantly of individuals, some marked only with numbers and others with full names and other details.\n\n>The governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said that \"the scale of the crimes committed by the invaders in Izium is enormous. This is bloody brutal terror.\"\n\n>>\"450 bodies of civilians with traces of violent death and torture were buried in a forest belt. It is difficult to imagine something like this in the 21st century, but now it is a tragic reality in Izium,\" he said.\n\n>Syniehubov asserted that \"among the bodies exhumed today, 99% show signs of violent death. There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck. Obviously, these people were tortured and executed. There are also children among the buried.\"\n\n>>\"About 200 law enforcement officers and experts are currently on the scene. The bodies will be sent for a forensic examination to determine the exact cause of death. After identifying the faces of the dead, they will all be buried with due respect,\" he said.\n\n>\"Each death will be investigated and become evidence of Russia's war crimes in international courts,\" Syniehubov said.",

And Taiwan would be pummeled to the ground, every major city reduced to rubble. And all that's without nuclear weapons coming into play.\n\nLet's speak plainly about the political challenge: Taiwan's population, if they held a referendum today, would not seek reunification with China. And China, by international law and recognized de jure territory, sees Taiwan as core Chinese land. To quickly explain the Chinese claim: Taiwan, illegally seized by Japan in 1895 had heretofore been part of China for many centuries. China then was given back Taiwan in 1945 by the US.

Replace China with Japan, Taiwan with the Philippines/Indonesia/Singapore, and of course America is still America. The Pacific War that came was a terrible tragedy, and we would do well not to repeat the mistakes of our ancestors.\n\nBut how do we do this? How do we ensure the people of Taiwan can celebrate their self-determination and live in the peace and harmony they have known, while also respecting the very real legal claims mainland China has to the island? I do not know.

Taiwan is still officially the Republic of China. The idea that Taiwan *is* China is ingrained in the national psyche. [According to 2020 polling](https://thediplomat.com/2020/12/more-and-more-taiwanese-favor-independence-and-think-the-us-would-help-fight-for-it/), pluralities of Taiwanese citizens support closer trade and economic ties to the mainland and the \"one China, two interpretations\" model of cross-strait relations. Only 6 percent of respondents supported immediate independence; over 30 percent support indefinite continuation of the status quo. Over 75 percent describe Taiwan's present state as an independent country called the Republic of China. \n\nIt's one thing to maintain a nuclear deterrent against hostile foreign countries.

Because all I've heard from everyone here is that yes: China will strike, that is inevitable, millions will die, and the chaos of war will determine the final outcome. I'm trying to see if there's a path out of this that doesn't lead to war--a war that even if China loses, will lead millions of deaths at the minimum. Hoping that China will change its strategic objectives is a hope not predicated on reality. You're betting on something that's not on the table right now. What is, according to the intel, is a Chinese invasion of Taiwan within the next 10 years. \n\nSo please, all those in disagreement with me: how would you prevent this war, in a realistic way that doesn't assume magical things will happen? And what I consider magical things are the following:\n\n1) China will accept de jure Taiwan independence within the next ten years without raising a fuss.\n\n2) Taiwan will accede and adopt the model of the Chinese Communist Party and have their entire citizenry absorbed into China proper, without a military invasion.\n\n3) China and Taiwan both accepting the existing uneasy status quo into eternity. As we saw in Ukraine, eventually, one state makes an aggressive decision. It may take years, and be a massive, colossal mistake, but aggressive action is inevitable without a change to the status quo.\n\nLastly: if Chinese aggression is inevitable, truly inevitable, what are we waiting for? They have 300 nukes, getting close to 400, but with limited range. We have 1500 with global range. We should smash their cities and population now in that case, to prevent their aggression, should we not? Otherwise we are just waiting for a coiled python to strike, building up its strength to pounce when it is as strong as we are. If conflict is inevitable between us, we have the clear advantage today. In 10 years? I don't know.",

Last week, Zelensky said negotiations with the Russian Federation surrounding the end of the war are currently &quot;impossible.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Putin also acknowledged China\u2019s \u201cquestions and concerns\u201d regarding the conflict in Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Key points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-war reserves were 31 billion USD</li>\n<li>In total, central bank sold 15 billion USD to keep exchange rate under control</li>\n<li>However, foreign aid helped to prop up reserves and currently central bank has 25 billion USD</li>\n<li>Central bank expects reserves to grow in September-October thanks to final tranches of promised aid, but expects them to fall November onward</li>\n<li>Given current trade balance, Central bank expects it would need at least 20 billion USD in 2023 to keep currency somewhat under control, but even then expects reserves to fall to about 20 billion at the end of 2023</li>\n<li>Foreign aid plays double role - both stabilizes the currency, and finances the budget</li>\n<li>Interestingly, draft budget for 2023 (draft approved by parliament, but not finalized) states budget deficit of 38 billion USD for 2023, financed by USA, EU and IMF (not aware of commitments to this financing though).

They argue that military conflict is now so pervasive in cyberspace that the United States should seek to shift away from deterrence in this domain \u2014 and more aggressively exploit the opportunities it presents.\n\nBeware, reader, in exploring this topic: Deterrence strategy is one of the wooliest and most abstract areas of defense analysis. In the early Cold War decades, it was the province of professors such as Herman Kahn at the Rand Corp., and Thomas Schelling and Henry Kissinger at Harvard \u2014 sometimes collectively known as the \u201cwizards of Armageddon.\u201d They \u201cthought about the unthinkable\u201d when it came to nuclear war, partly to dissuade the Soviet Union from ever launching an attack.\n\nTimes have changed, argues the new book \u201cCyber Persistence Theory: Redefining National Security in Cyberspace.\u201d Its three authors have all worked closely on cyber strategy for the Pentagon: Michael P. Fischerkeller as a cyber expert with the Institute for Defense Analyses; Emily O. Goldman as a strategist at U.S. Cyber Command; and Richard J. Harknett as a cyber expert at the University of Cincinnati and the first scholar-in-residence at Cyber Command.\n\nThe book isn\u2019t an official policy document. But a foreword from Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, notes that the three authors have been \u201claying the foundations for the Command\u2019s approach of Persistent Engagement\u201d and that their book offers a \u201cframework for understanding \u2026 operational effectiveness moving forward.\u201d\n\nTo sum up the authors\u2019 arguments: Cyberweapons fundamentally change the nature of warfare. Borders don\u2019t matter much to digital code. And cyberwar is a continuum (and always happening at a low level), rather than an on-off switch. It\u2019s a new domain, with new rules.\n\n\u201cCyberspace must be understood primarily as an environment of exploitation rather than coercion,\u201d the authors write. \u201cAchieving strategic gains in the cyber strategic environment does not require concession of the opponent.\u201d In other words, much of what we think we know about war doesn\u2019t apply in this domain.\n\nI had a chance to explore this esoteric subject in August, when the authors asked me to moderate a public discussion of their book at the National Defense University. The gathering produced a lively exchange among military cyber strategists.\n\nTo get an overview of the evolution of deterrence thinking, let\u2019s start with Harknett\u2019s vision of three phases in the history of warfare, culminating in cyber.\n\nThe first period, beginning in ancient history, involved \u201cconventional\u201d weapons \u2014 rocks at first, then eventually guns, cannons, battleships, bombers \u2014 to coerce the adversary into submission. Nation states zealously defended their borders, and the goal of warfare was coercion and victory. Deterrence involved having more and better cannons, bigger battleships, more planes. But obviously, looking at the two world wars in the 20th century, that version of deterrence didn\u2019t work very well. The arsenals almost invited war.\n\nThat first period lasted until 1945, when the United States introduced nuclear weapons that, soon enough, were duplicated by the Soviet Union. With the potential to kill hundreds of millions of people in a quick exchange, these weapons could effectively destroy civilization. The culmination of war became not victory but doomsday.\n\nNuclear war, as was often said, cannot be won and should never be fought. So, the goal of nuclear strategy was not to win wars but to prevent them. This nuclear version of deterrence has worked quite well for 73 years and counting.\n\nThe third period involves cyberweapons, and the assumptions are fundamentally different. Weapons can\u2019t be counted, identified, tracked or easily controlled. They are used in a borderless electronic world where traditional ideas of sovereignty don\u2019t work very well. The authors argue that this domain is \u201cmicro-vulnerable (and inherently exploitable),\u201d in that targets can be hit easily, but \u201cmacro-resilient (and thus stable),\u201d because nations will persist, even if targeted.\n\nTwo lessons of the Ukraine war is that cyber defenses appear to work better than might have been expected, and that cyber offense works worse. That\u2019s one explanation for Ukraine\u2019s amazing resilience against the Russian onslaught.\n\nThe authors offer some suggestions for this new domain: Strategists should have rules for continuous engagement, rather than plan for contingencies; they should prepare for continuous operations not \u201cepisodic\u201d ones, and they should seek \u201ccumulative\u201d gains, rather than final victory. As the authors wrote in a recent article in the National Interest: \u201cBecause of the fluidity of digital technology, security rests on seizing and sustaining the initiative.\u201d\n\nCyberspace might prove to be the ultimate version of forever war. But if these strategists are right, it could be less dangerous, and ultimately more stable, than the convulsive explosions we\u2019ve known as war for millennia.",

Maybe if the US had mobilized a larger army it would have been different. But remember that the 90 division gamble was a strategic choice with significant trade offs and which was predicated on the existence of an eastern front.\n\nAnd as to the issue of nuclear weapons - in 1945 the US was not producing enough of them to have a significant battlefield effect on the strategic level. If anything, having only a couple and using them sparingly in combat, even in the face of battlefield defeats, would reveal how few the US actually had in a way that the IRL bombings of Japan did not. To say nothing of the impact on domestic and global public opinion of using them in a first strike on a former ally.\n\nAnd remember - the US and UK went through a MASSIVE postwar demobilization soon after the surrender of Japan. It was simply unsustainable to keep all those men under arms. So the window to attack with conventional forces would have been 1945, or probably never. Throughout the rest of the Cold War, NATO forces in Europe, though significant, were adequate to defend West Germany until reinforcements arrived.
