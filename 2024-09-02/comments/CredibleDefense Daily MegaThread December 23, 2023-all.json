        "body": "I will try to give a Christmas update on the tactical evolution of the front during the recent weeks. My main source are the Ukrainian military observators Mashovets and Kovalenko, several Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels (e.g. WarArchive for geolocations) and of course DeepState. I suggest having a map under eye while reading, for instance DeepState or Andrew Perpetua's.\n\nKupyansk Sector. The 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th Army (WMD), with support from the 138th Motorized Brigade of the same army and regiments of the Territorial Forces, continues to attack Synkyvka. In recent weeks, the usual infantry-only attack attempts have given way to mechanized attacks, which have been unsuccessful: the Russians are stuck at the gates of the village as they were in late November. These kinds of frontal attacks have been sharply criticized by those Russian channels that maintain a semblance of objectivity. The village is defended by the Ukrainian 14th Mechanized Brigade, and it appears that the entire 57th Motorized Brigade and the 2nd Mechanized Battalion of the 30th Mech Brigade have probably also been moved to the area (in both cases transferred from the northern flank of Bakhmut), while the 21st and 67th Mech Brigades should have returned to the Kreminna sector. There is also a battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade in the area. There have been some Russian advances, however, in the forest south of Lyman Pershyi, defended by elements of the 41st and 115th Mech Brigades and probably also of the 60th Mech Brigade, with the capture of some platoon-strongholds by the Russians.\n\nUkrainian observers (both Mashovets and Kovalenko) reported the arrival of two Russian engineering units in the rear of the sector. The 30th Engineer Regiment of the 6th Army and the 45th Separate Engineer Battalion have been deployed to Topoli, along with the 344th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 138th Motorized Brigade). One guess is that they want to prepare to force the Oskil to bring the battle to the western bank, in the direction of Kamyanka. TOS-1s would have been deployed in the area, likely to cover the crossing, should it have a way. It\u2019s not clear why they would do this, especially something so risky, when there is the state border so close by. We'll see. Perhaps it could be a deception to get more Ukrainian forces deployed to the western bank.\n\nRussian attacks from Vilshana and Pershotravneve to the south have lost intensity and the situation in the area is stable. Sustained attacks continue from Orlyanka and Yahidne, by elements of the 1st Tank Army (WMD) and the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet. The Ukrainians brought new reinforcements into the area: the 15th Regiment of the National Guard from Kreminna and the 108th Battalion of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade from the Siversk salient. The latter as soon as it arrived had retaken an area between Ivanivka and Yahidne, that was eventually retaken for the third time by the Russians about a week ago; meaning, the Russians took it once, then the Ukrainians counterattacked and recaptured the area, which was then retaken by the Russians, retaken again by the Ukrainians and finally occupied again by the Russians - yes, that's the situation up there. On the whole, however, the lines are quite stable, and tactically important Hill 195 is in Ukrainian hands. The Ukrainian garrison has to be supplied mainly from Borova (although, occasionally, Ukrainian engineers build crossings for light vehicles further north on the Oskil) but at the moment this causes no problems. The sector is clearly not the main Russian effort...\n\nSvatove sector. Quiet and stable situation. In November the \"Steel Kordon\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard arrived in the area, probably to replace the 43rd Mech Brigade, which was moved to the Kupyansk sector (in the area near Orlyanka), following what the 32nd Mech Brigade had done in the previous weeks. \n\nKreminna sector. The situation here has become hotter in the last month. Perhaps it would be an exaggeration to say that the Russians have launched an offensive, but let\u2019s say that they have begun to attack vigorously in several places. In the last days of November the 488th Motorized Regiment of the 144th Motorized Division of the 20th Army (WMD) succeeded in driving the Ukrainians out of the watershed between the Zherebets and the Krasna (i.e. where the border between Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts runs), advancing about 2 kms in a 3 kms width, in the direction of Terny. The area was poorly defended on the Ukrainian side, especially after sending the 1st Special Purpose Brigade \u201cIvan Bohun\u201d to the northern flank of Bakhmut. The Ukrainians had managed to stabilize the situation by sending the 21st Mech Brigade into the area along with the recently formed 97th Mechanized Battalion of the 60th Mech Brigade (former \u201cAzov Kharkiv\u201d unit). The 144th Motorized Division is continuing to heavily attack, advancing an additional 1,7 kms across a width of 2,5 kms during the recent days. Although it\u2019s not the first priority for the Russians, Mashovets explained well the Russians' goal in the area: to drive the Ukrainians out of the eastern bank of the Zherebets (i.e., from Makiivka to Yampolivka), with that being the first phase of an operation aimed at driving the Ukrainians out of the eastern bank of the Oskil and eventually targeting Lyman. The situation is becoming more complicated in the area between Terny and Yampolivka, i.e., in the southern part of that axis (to the north, the Ukrainians in recent months had stopped Russian attacks between Makiivka and Nevske). The Russians captured the heights of the watershed before Terny and now boast an elevation advantage over the Ukrainians. It\u2019s an area where it\u2019s better to keep an eye on and it should not to be underestimated. \n\nThere has also been activity in the Serebrianka Forest, with attacks by the 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division of the 41st Army in the eastern part of the forest, in the direction of the former recreation center \"Hunter's House\", repulsed in particular by the \"Azov\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard. Some units of the 90th Tank Division are indeed still in the Kreminna sector (while others are in Avdiivka) and there has been no update on sending the rest of the division down there. However, the Russians are reportedly finishing the deployment of the new 25th Army in the Kreminna sector. There are some rumors that elements of the 201st Military Base of the Central MD have also arrived in the area to reinforce the grouping.\n\nSiversk Salient. The Ukrainian presence has been weakened by sending some units elsewhere over the past few months, but recently the 118th TDF Brigade has reportedly arrived to partially make up for this. There are Russian mechanized attacks towards Spirne by units of the 2nd Corps, which were repulsed by the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade: there has been minimal progress for the Russians and relevant losses. On the southern flank of the salient, looking towards Soledar, the situation is more difficult. The Russians, specifically elements of the 51st Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division and the 123rd Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps, are pushing along the Siversk-Nyrkove railway between Vesele and Berestove, with progress of at least 1,5 km during this month. In the area near Sakko i Vantsetti the 137th Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division is reportedly trying to push on, but without particular success. Although they have probably occupied that Ukrainian mini-salient south of Rozdolivka.\n\nNorthern flank of Bakhmut. Particularly here, I recommend having a [topographical map]( https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-wmv51/Ukraine/) under eye to have a better understanding of the situation. The Russians since November have launched an offensive. Their long-term objective is no secret and is called Chasiv Yar. To approach it they must take Bohdanivka, among others. This village is in a basin and surrounded by high ground to the north and south. To the north of the village, attacks are carried out by the 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet along with the \"Sever-V\" Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade (formerly called Sever-Z), made up largely of convicts who have been given considerably better training and heavy equipment. During the first half of December they had advanced a few hundred meters. In recent days, new important successes are to be reported: DeepState reported an advance of up to 1,7 km in the northern flank of the village, with the conquest of several forest belts, signaling that the Russians are beginning to move up the high ground there. At the same time, the Russians reportedly entered the northern outskirts of Bohdanivka, with clashes in the village. [1/4]",

In the area near Sakko i Vantsetti the 137th Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division is reportedly trying to push on, but without particular success. Although they have probably occupied that Ukrainian mini-salient south of Rozdolivka.</p>\n\n<p>Northern flank of Bakhmut. Particularly here, I recommend having a <a href=\"https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-wmv51/Ukraine/\">topographical map</a> under eye to have a better understanding of the situation. The Russians since November have launched an offensive. Their long-term objective is no secret and is called Chasiv Yar. To approach it they must take Bohdanivka, among others. This village is in a basin and surrounded by high ground to the north and south. To the north of the village, attacks are carried out by the 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet along with the &quot;Sever-V&quot; Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade (formerly called Sever-Z), made up largely of convicts who have been given considerably better training and heavy equipment. During the first half of December they had advanced a few hundred meters. In recent days, new important successes are to be reported: DeepState reported an advance of up to 1,7 km in the northern flank of the village, with the conquest of several forest belts, signaling that the Russians are beginning to move up the high ground there. At the same time, the Russians reportedly entered the northern outskirts of Bohdanivka, with clashes in the village. [1/4]</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "The 98th VDV Division, recently reinforced by the new 299th Air Assault Regiment, is attacking in the southern flank of Bohdanivka, achieving the most considerable advances in the entire Bakhmut sector. In the last two weeks alone they have advanced 1,7 km along the Bakhmut - Chasiv Yar railroad east of Bohdanivka and 2 kms in the area half way between Bohdanivka and Khromove, lately even capturing territory that had remained in Ukrainian hands during the Battle of Bakhmut. They first captured the entire \"Garden Center\" area, reaching and overtaking Road O0506 and then conquering the system of trenches north of it. Unfortunately, the latest DeepState update reported that the Russians also conquered the system of trenches south of this road, where in March/April the heroism of soldiers of the 67th Mech Brigade and of a battalion of the 92nd Mech Brigade had stopped the Wagner\u2019s onslaught directed at closing the Bakhmut salient. Of course, today those fortifications are no longer badly needed by the Ukrainians as they were back then, but it\u2019s clear that the Russians want to attack Ivanivske from the north, a village that represents another medium-term Russian objective. This, in my opinion, is the most worrying situation of the whole front at the moment. The Ukrainian positions are being overwhelmed by Russian artillery. Kovalenko reported that the Russians would have 80k men in the Bakhmut sector, more than there were at the height of the battle during this winter. This was achieved thanks to the arrival of new units, which has even allowed others to be sent from here to Avdiivka as we\u2019ll see. Right now, after Avdiivka, Bakhmut is the second main Russian effort.\n\nThe 11th VDV Brigade in the recent days has finished the conquest of Khromove and the entire motocross track west of it. From the \"microrayon\" area of Bakhmut, the \"Kamerton\" unit of the \u201cAkhmat Special Forces\u201d (recently formed and made up of former Wagnerites) has advanced up to 800 meters, crossing a ditch, in the direction of Ivanivske. The situation is therefore very delicate. The Ukrainians have brought the bulk of the 1st Special Purpose Brigade \u201cIvan Bohun\u201d and 107th TDF Brigade into the area to assist the 56th Motorized Brigade, the 77th Airmobile Brigade, and the 17th Tank Brigade. With the redeployment of the 57th Motorized Brigade to Kupyansk, of the 127th TDF Brigade to Velyka Novosilka, and at least of one battalion of the 241st TDF Brigade to Kreminna, the Ukrainians had been considerably weakened in the area. I saw a video where the Russians took a Ukrainian POW in this flank who claimed to belong to a battalion of the 142nd Infantry Brigade, a new Ukrainian formation. Let\u2019s wait for other confirmations. \n\nSouthern flank. In the last week the 102nd Motorized Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th Army (SMD) has captured the vast majority of the Bakhmut\u2019s dachas area, advancing up to 1,2 km towards Ivanivske. The new 119th Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division along with units of the 2nd Corps and \"Akhmat\" detachments reportedly made relevant advances in the area of the heights north-west of Klishchiivka, capturing part of the system of trenches located there. It\u2019s possible that in recent days the Ukrainians have lost Hill 215. There are still several higher hills in Ukrainian hands to the west, but further Russian advances in the area could jeopardize the hold of Klishchiivka. The Russians claimed to have crossed the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway and captured several houses on the northern outskirts of Klishchiivka, but I cannot confirm this and don\u2019t think it\u2019s true, although there were certainly attempts. The 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps and the 1307th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 3rd Corps), both restaffed after heavy losses in the past months, are attacking toward Klishchiivka from the east, from the railway. Without any progress, however. Other units of the 72nd Motorized Brigade, along with elements of the 83rd VDV Brigade, are attacking towards Andriivka, without success. \n\nFurther south, in Kurdyumivka, the Russians, after driving the Ukrainians out of the territory east of the railway, recently attacked to the west, reaching the forest belt along the canal (west of the village) that had been liberated by the Ukrainians between July and August. Let\u2019s reecall that in early December the notorious 3rd Assault Brigade was withdrawn to the rear to rest (it has spent exactly one year of fighting around Bakhmut) and raise new battalions to host the many recruits applying to be part of the brigade. In the area, however, the Ukrainian grouping is still good and large: there is the 5th Assault Brigade and by now the bulk of the 93rd Mech Brigade and the 92nd Assault Brigade have arrived in the area. The latter in recent months had been reformed from a mechanized brigade to an assault brigade and withdrawn from the Svatove sector (where it had been replaced by the 25th Airborne Brigade): so we are talking about a fresh brigade, and  the 93rd Brigade in recent months has been reconstituted after the losses during the Battle of Bakhmut. There is also another very good brigade: the 80th Air Assault Brigade. In the area there are the 22nd Mech Brigade and recently the 42nd Mech Brigade should have arrived from Kreminna. There are also the \"Lyut\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard and further south the 28th Mech Brigade. Recently the 114th TDF Brigade has arrived too. This, as well as the other TDF brigades that arrived in the Bakhmut area as reinforcements, are brigades that have spent much of 2023 being restored and are now back in operation.\n\nHorlivka sector. Quiet situation. The Russians reportedly have retaken the \u201cterrikon\u201d west of the city that had been taken by the 24th Mech Brigade a few weeks ago. In any case, we are talking about minor clashes. \n\nAvdiivka sector. Well, the Russian main effort. I had written a lot about Avdiivka in the past, and really there is not that much new to say. Progress is really limited. In every direction. On the Russian directions of attack and order of battle I had written [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/186oum6/comment/kbbwj8a/), also writing about how, in case of lack of success toward Stepove, the Russians might turn their attentions towards Novokalynove and Ocheretyne, widening the flank. Let's see now what has happened in recent weeks. \n\nNorth-eastern flank. During November the Russians largely carried out Wagner-style infantry attacks, using mainly elements of 1st Corps. New mechanized attacks (though not to the scale of the first week) occurred in recent weeks, with a far greater commitment by units of the Central Military District. Since late November the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army (CMD), until then essentially in reserve, was deployed in the direction of Stepove. There were attacks with tanks and BMPs towards Stepove, which were stopped by the Ukrainians. Since November the Russian assault units have occupied for several times the houses on the eastern end of Stepove, only to be driven out, returning to assault these positions, be driven out again, reoccupy them, etc. All of this with enormous losses. The Bradleys of the 47th Brigade are very active around Stepove. The Russians complain about how FPV drones and ATGMs seem unable to stop the Bradleys and thus the threat their autocannons bring to the Russians, which is hard to underestimate.\n\nThe Russians currently control houses on the eastern outskirts of Stepove but don\u2019t seem able to push forward. Since late November they have expanded their efforts towards the flanks of the village. By advancing along the forest belt perpendicular to the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway (between Stepove the Coke Plant), they had managed to occupy Ukrainian positions along the forest belt parallel to the railway (where the execution of Ukrainian POWs belonging to the 45th Separate Rifle Battalion took place). A successful counterattack by the 47th Brigade a few days later managed to drive the Russians out from these positions, thus securing Stepove's southern flank. About ten days ago the Russians reportedly captured the forest belt parallel to the railway on Stepove's northern flank, on the other hand. This could be a negative development for the hold of Stepove but at the moment the Ukrainians seem to have stabilized the situation. Towards Novokalynove no new progress has been recorded in recent weeks, bar the Russians advancing a few hundred meters towards Hill 240, at the intersection of the railroads, capturing part of a forest line. There is no progress in the Coke Plant area, in fact a Ukrainian fortress - it could not be otherwise, since that area is the key for the hold of Avdiivka. On the other side of the railway, the Russians have consolidated their control in the area near the water pumping station (not to be confused with the Donetsk Filtration Station) and the Avdiivka reservoir area. East of the latter, they began attacking the \"private sector\", seizing houses along several streets. The situation has been stabilized by the Ukrainians but in any case this should not have serious consequences, given the physical protection offered by the reservoir to the Ukrainian positions west of it. I have no news of Russian advances in the sand quarry area, and further south the Donetsk Filtration Station, a Ukrainian stronghold, continues to hold, despite its uncomfortable position after the Russian advances along the ponds to the east.

                "body": "Industrial zone of Avdiivka, also known as Promka. The Russians have conquered the entire industrial area and the vineyard south of it, and probably during December the Ukrainians had to abandon the small quarry west of the industrial zone and the first houses of the \"private sector\". The Russians are trying to start taking over the latter, specifically the first houses (coming from the east) along Yasynovskyi Lane and Vulytsia Kolosova Street. They have probably taken control of a few houses, although their further ambitions have been stopped by the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians continue to hold positions in the holiday cottages in Skotovata, which are very important in order to defend the former restaurant \"Tsarska Ohota\" from the east, a very important Ukrainian stronghold. The breakthrough of Ukrainian positions in Promka in November was definitely a negative development, but at the moment the Ukrainians are keeping the situation under control. The Russians units active in this area: the 87th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps, supported by the 1487th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, elements of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps, and the \"Veterans\" Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade (actually a reinforced battalion), made up of decently skilled volunteers, that, to my understanding, has to be credited with the capture of the Ukrainian positions in the Promka. As for the 6th Motorized Division, it\u2019s likely not fully deployed: we are talking about the 57th Motorized Regiment and the 10th Tank Regiment. The former was relatively marginally involved and would be a reserve. \n\nIn the southern flank, the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army (CMD) was brought into battle in early December and the largest mechanized attack in this flank since the first week of the offensive in October took place. The attack was repulsed with great losses for the Russians, who did, however, manage to advance a few hundred meters, probably returning to positions along the last \"latitudinal\" line before Sjeverne, which, after all, they had already occupied during the first week of the offensive.  The Ukrainian 53rd Mech Brigade receives, in my opinion, too little credit for what it\u2019s doing there. The Russians in the first half of December reportedly succeeded in advancing by several hundred meters along the forest belt south-east of the quarry between Vodyane and Opytne, but before they can get any closer to the town they will have to face several fortified Ukrainian-held tree lines. No progress is reported towards the \"Zenith\" base in Spartak or towards \"Tsarska Ohota\" from the south. There were, during December, some small advances towards Pervomaiske, both from Pisky and Vodyane, but we are talking about minor movements.\n\nAs for the Ukrainian order of battle, I had written about it [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18f34ip/credibledefense_daily_megathread_december_10_2023/kcrk1lk/), where there\u2019s also a link to a map I had made. It\u2019s likely that in the defense area of the 47th Mech Brigade a battalion of the 23rd Mech Brigade was deployed, since there is a video posted in December of FPV drones of this brigade in action in Avdiivka and I discovered a Ukrainian soldier MIA in Stepove during mid-November, belonging to a military unit whose code matches that of the 23rd Brigade. It\u2019s possible that elements of the 67th Mech Brigade arrived to reinforce the positions of the 47th Brigade - there are several rumors about this, but I have no confirmation yet. The 116th Mech Brigade was brought to Avdiivka from the Orikhiv sector - beside that, the deployment situation is the one I had written in the map, except for a few battalions that I did not put in (for example, Skala Battalion, which follows the 47th Brigade).  \n\nAs for the Russians, their order of battle is listed in the same map, save for the brigades that were in reserve and were brought into battle in the meanwhile. Overall I assess that most of units of the Central Military District retain combat capability, which makes me very, very cautious about assessments that the Avdiivka offensive has culminated. The worse off ones are the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army in the north-east flank, which has been greatly involved for more than 2 months (both in the direction of Stepove and of Novokalynove) and has suffered heavy losses, and the 55th Mountain Brigade in the southern flank, which has been trying unsuccessfully for two months to push toward the 9th District of Avdiivka and the former \"Tsarska Ohota\" restaurant. This brigade is largely made up of Tuvans, and as a corollary a good part of the Tuvans are fighting in this brigade (we are talking about a region with few inhabitants after all). In the Telegram channel \"Poisk in UA\", which posts information about Russian KIA/MIA/POWs, more than 50 KIA notices of Tuvans have been posted since the week after the beginning of the offensive, a much greater pace than in previous months. Let\u2019s recall that death notices often have lags of several months and only a portion of them are made public. Tuva has only 330k residents. Imagine a city of that size losing at least 50 men to war in 2 months. If we look at Russian casualties in relation to the population of the entire country they are not huge numbers, but in certain Siberian oblasts/republics the losses begin to be heavy in relation to the inhabitants. \n\nIn November elements of the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army had been brought into combat in the southern flank, but overall as far as I know this brigade was still involved to a relatively limited extent. The 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army was involved in attack actions in both October and November in the north-east flank but lately seems to be employed to a lesser extent, a sign that some units of this brigade may have become a reserve to be employed in the future.\n\nNumerous units of 1st Corps (and of the Territorial Forces) on the other hand are really beginning to be put out of fighting capability, although there are several regiments and separate battalions of the 1st Corps in reserve. Let's talk about the Russian reserves in the sector: in addition to units of the 1st Corps (and of the Territorial Forces), there is the 239th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division in the north-east flank: so far it has not been committed; the Ukrainians with FPV drones managed, however, to destroy a T-90M from this regiment. Also in this flank in early December the 9th Motorized Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet arrived, which had been deployed since May in the northern flank of Bakhmut. Potentially in the future the Russians could bring additional units of the 90th Tank Division. Both Kovalenko and Mashovets wrote that the Russians are planning to move the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (EMD), currently active in Kurdyumivka south of Bakhmut, to the Avdiivka area. Kovalenko suggests to Avdiivka itself while Mashovets suggests Marinka - in any case the intention to move it is therefore known to Ukrainian military intelligence. We shall see. The goal of the Russians is to maintain a 60k men-strong grouping around Avdiivka. \n\nMarinka sector. The Russians had been pushing along this small town for\u2026 always. At the beginning of December, the Ukrainians withdrew from the ruins in the south-western part of the town, for some reason that is not clear to me. At that point, the Russians launched an attack on the ruins still in Ukrainian hands, by the 103rd Motorized Regiment and the 163rd Tank Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th Army, succeeding in capturing them and thus gaining control of the entire settlement of Marinka south of the Osykova River (which is the bulk of the town). At the same time these units, with the support of the 5th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, launched an attack against the part of Marinka north of this river, advancing 1 km along Ivana Franka Street and probably also occupying the area of the depots north of Marinka. Thus after almost 2 years of fighting the urban phase of the battle of Marinka is almost over, except for the final part of Ivana Franka Street whose houses are in Ukrainian hands. The Russians are now trying to advance into the fields south-west of Marinka. Ukrainian artillery has limited their progress but in the recent days they have managed to advance several hundred meters and occupy the forest belt west of Marinka. The new Ukrainian positions will probably be set up before Heorhiivka. As a reminder, the area from Krasnohorivka (the one north of Marinka) to Solodke  is covered by the Ukrainian 79th Air Assault Brigade, a good brigade that is however over-stretched and has been active in this sector continuously since September 2022. This brigade likely requested reinforcements from the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, which responded to the call. A battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade (probably the one that was in Bakhmut in the summer/autumn) and elements of the 46th Airmobile Brigade from the Orikhiv sector arrived in Marinka, which was confirmed by videos of FPV drones in action posted by the brigade's UAV unit and the fact that I found a Ukrainian soldier from the 46th Brigade MIA in Marinka in early December. Elements of this brigade allegedly attempted a counterattack along Ivana Franka Street, which, however, was unsuccessful. [3/4]",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Industrial zone of Avdiivka, also known as Promka. The Russians have conquered the entire industrial area and the vineyard south of it, and probably during December the Ukrainians had to abandon the small quarry west of the industrial zone and the first houses of the &quot;private sector&quot;. The Russians are trying to start taking over the latter, specifically the first houses (coming from the east) along Yasynovskyi Lane and Vulytsia Kolosova Street. They have probably taken control of a few houses, although their further ambitions have been stopped by the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians continue to hold positions in the holiday cottages in Skotovata, which are very important in order to defend the former restaurant &quot;Tsarska Ohota&quot; from the east, a very important Ukrainian stronghold. The breakthrough of Ukrainian positions in Promka in November was definitely a negative development, but at the moment the Ukrainians are keeping the situation under control. The Russians units active in this area: the 87th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps, supported by the 1487th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, elements of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps, and the &quot;Veterans&quot; Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade (actually a reinforced battalion), made up of decently skilled volunteers, that, to my understanding, has to be credited with the capture of the Ukrainian positions in the Promka. As for the 6th Motorized Division, it\u2019s likely not fully deployed: we are talking about the 57th Motorized Regiment and the 10th Tank Regiment. The former was relatively marginally involved and would be a reserve. </p>\n\n<p>In the southern flank, the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army (CMD) was brought into battle in early December and the largest mechanized attack in this flank since the first week of the offensive in October took place. The attack was repulsed with great losses for the Russians, who did, however, manage to advance a few hundred meters, probably returning to positions along the last &quot;latitudinal&quot; line before Sjeverne, which, after all, they had already occupied during the first week of the offensive.  The Ukrainian 53rd Mech Brigade receives, in my opinion, too little credit for what it\u2019s doing there. The Russians in the first half of December reportedly succeeded in advancing by several hundred meters along the forest belt south-east of the quarry between Vodyane and Opytne, but before they can get any closer to the town they will have to face several fortified Ukrainian-held tree lines. No progress is reported towards the &quot;Zenith&quot; base in Spartak or towards &quot;Tsarska Ohota&quot; from the south. There were, during December, some small advances towards Pervomaiske, both from Pisky and Vodyane, but we are talking about minor movements.</p>\n\n<p>As for the Ukrainian order of battle, I had written about it <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18f34ip/credibledefense_daily_megathread_december_10_2023/kcrk1lk/\">here</a>, where there\u2019s also a link to a map I had made. It\u2019s likely that in the defense area of the 47th Mech Brigade a battalion of the 23rd Mech Brigade was deployed, since there is a video posted in December of FPV drones of this brigade in action in Avdiivka and I discovered a Ukrainian soldier MIA in Stepove during mid-November, belonging to a military unit whose code matches that of the 23rd Brigade. It\u2019s possible that elements of the 67th Mech Brigade arrived to reinforce the positions of the 47th Brigade - there are several rumors about this, but I have no confirmation yet. The 116th Mech Brigade was brought to Avdiivka from the Orikhiv sector - beside that, the deployment situation is the one I had written in the map, except for a few battalions that I did not put in (for example, Skala Battalion, which follows the 47th Brigade).  </p>\n\n<p>As for the Russians, their order of battle is listed in the same map, save for the brigades that were in reserve and were brought into battle in the meanwhile. Overall I assess that most of units of the Central Military District retain combat capability, which makes me very, very cautious about assessments that the Avdiivka offensive has culminated. The worse off ones are the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army in the north-east flank, which has been greatly involved for more than 2 months (both in the direction of Stepove and of Novokalynove) and has suffered heavy losses, and the 55th Mountain Brigade in the southern flank, which has been trying unsuccessfully for two months to push toward the 9th District of Avdiivka and the former &quot;Tsarska Ohota&quot; restaurant. This brigade is largely made up of Tuvans, and as a corollary a good part of the Tuvans are fighting in this brigade (we are talking about a region with few inhabitants after all). In the Telegram channel &quot;Poisk in UA&quot;, which posts information about Russian KIA/MIA/POWs, more than 50 KIA notices of Tuvans have been posted since the week after the beginning of the offensive, a much greater pace than in previous months. Let\u2019s recall that death notices often have lags of several months and only a portion of them are made public. Tuva has only 330k residents. Imagine a city of that size losing at least 50 men to war in 2 months. If we look at Russian casualties in relation to the population of the entire country they are not huge numbers, but in certain Siberian oblasts/republics the losses begin to be heavy in relation to the inhabitants. </p>\n\n<p>In November elements of the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army had been brought into combat in the southern flank, but overall as far as I know this brigade was still involved to a relatively limited extent. The 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army was involved in attack actions in both October and November in the north-east flank but lately seems to be employed to a lesser extent, a sign that some units of this brigade may have become a reserve to be employed in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous units of 1st Corps (and of the Territorial Forces) on the other hand are really beginning to be put out of fighting capability, although there are several regiments and separate battalions of the 1st Corps in reserve. Let&#39;s talk about the Russian reserves in the sector: in addition to units of the 1st Corps (and of the Territorial Forces), there is the 239th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division in the north-east flank: so far it has not been committed; the Ukrainians with FPV drones managed, however, to destroy a T-90M from this regiment. Also in this flank in early December the 9th Motorized Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet arrived, which had been deployed since May in the northern flank of Bakhmut. Potentially in the future the Russians could bring additional units of the 90th Tank Division. Both Kovalenko and Mashovets wrote that the Russians are planning to move the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (EMD), currently active in Kurdyumivka south of Bakhmut, to the Avdiivka area. Kovalenko suggests to Avdiivka itself while Mashovets suggests Marinka - in any case the intention to move it is therefore known to Ukrainian military intelligence. We shall see. The goal of the Russians is to maintain a 60k men-strong grouping around Avdiivka. </p>\n\n<p>Marinka sector. The Russians had been pushing along this small town for\u2026 always. At the beginning of December, the Ukrainians withdrew from the ruins in the south-western part of the town, for some reason that is not clear to me. At that point, the Russians launched an attack on the ruins still in Ukrainian hands, by the 103rd Motorized Regiment and the 163rd Tank Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th Army, succeeding in capturing them and thus gaining control of the entire settlement of Marinka south of the Osykova River (which is the bulk of the town). At the same time these units, with the support of the 5th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, launched an attack against the part of Marinka north of this river, advancing 1 km along Ivana Franka Street and probably also occupying the area of the depots north of Marinka. Thus after almost 2 years of fighting the urban phase of the battle of Marinka is almost over, except for the final part of Ivana Franka Street whose houses are in Ukrainian hands. The Russians are now trying to advance into the fields south-west of Marinka. Ukrainian artillery has limited their progress but in the recent days they have managed to advance several hundred meters and occupy the forest belt west of Marinka. The new Ukrainian positions will probably be set up before Heorhiivka. As a reminder, the area from Krasnohorivka (the one north of Marinka) to Solodke  is covered by the Ukrainian 79th Air Assault Brigade, a good brigade that is however over-stretched and has been active in this sector continuously since September 2022. This brigade likely requested reinforcements from the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, which responded to the call. A battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade (probably the one that was in Bakhmut in the summer/autumn) and elements of the 46th Airmobile Brigade from the Orikhiv sector arrived in Marinka, which was confirmed by videos of FPV drones in action posted by the brigade&#39;s UAV unit and the fact that I found a Ukrainian soldier from the 46th Brigade MIA in Marinka in early December. Elements of this brigade allegedly attempted a counterattack along Ivana Franka Street, which, however, was unsuccessful. [3/4]</p>\n</div>",

They did not succeed frontally against this village, but they did by attacking the fields south-east of it. In the first half of December they advanced more than 2 kms along the forest belts, occupying an area of several square kilometers and putting Novomykhailivka in a sort of salient. The area of the fortified farm \"Zverinets\" is still in Ukrainian hands, but is being attacked by the Russians. The Ukrainian 79th Brigade would now be concentrating on defending Novomykhailivka, which the Russians have been violently attacking since early October. During December the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps (EMD) advanced more than 1 km from the south, in fact coming to surround Novomykhailivka from two sides, having already reached the village\u2019s gates from the east. Several medium-scale mechanized attacks took place in this area. However, Ukrainian paratroopers are putting up strenuous resistance: recently the Russian 39th Brigade reportedly lost almost a dozen armored vehicles assaulting Novomykhailivka from the south. There is heavy fighting as we speak in the area of the graveyard and in the farms south of the village. This week from the east assault detachments of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet and of the OBTF \"Kaskad\" of the 1st Corps attacked, without success. It goes without saying that the Russians' long-term goals here is to drive the Ukrainians away from the Donetsk-Volnovakha-Melitopol railway and to attack Vuhledar from the east, after failing several times to do so from the south.\n\nVuhledar sector. Nothing to say actually. Situation all in all is relatively quiet. Ditto for the Velyka Novosilka sector and the Polohy sector. The only thing to be said is that the intensity of the fighting has decreased considerably compared to the past few months, and this may suggest that the Russians are restoring the combat effectiveness of formations and units of the Eastern Military District, which is deployed almost in full in these three sectors. \n\nOrikhiv sector. After Ukrainian advances in November, from early December the Russians began a series of counterattacks against Ukrainian positions. From Novoprokopivka and Kopani the 71st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Division and the 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th Army (SMD), together with elements of the 76th VDV Division, attacked towards Robotyne. From the south they consolidated Russian control over a large gray area north and west of Novoprokopivka, probably capturing the system of trenches halfway between Robotyne and Novoprokopivka. From the west they advanced almost 1 km, recapturing the second forest belt southwest of Robotyne, where the Russians have captured the Leopard 2A4 damaged and abandoned by the Ukrainians. Thanks to Ukrainian advances during November in this area there is still 1 km in Ukrainian hands before the beginning of the settlement of Robotyne, which the Russians had frequently counterattacked during late August and September. On the eastern flank of the salient the 7th VDV Division counterattacked and recovered several hundred meters of ground between Verbove and Novopokrovka, and the Ukrainians had to abandon Hill 140, from which they had driven the Russians out during November. This height is located along the high ground terrain (by southern Ukrainian standards) north-west of Verbove. Since October there has been a major rotation in the area: the 47th and 116th Mech Brigades have been moved to Avdiivka and the 46th Airmobile Brigade to Marinka, while the 33rd Mech Brigade, the bulk of the 23rd Mech Brigade, and possibly the new 88th Mech Brigade (I had written about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18f34ip/comment/kcsmptb/)) have been brought into action. During the past month the Ukrainians have captured a few dozens of POWs belonging to 70th Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Division. Among them are Nepalese nationals, who answer questions in English instead of Russian. POWs report the existence of at least one platoon made up of Nepalese, which were students or workers in Russia and chose to sign a contract as a result of financial issues.\n\nKamyanske sector. Quiet situation. The only thing I will point out, for those interested in the order of battle, is that there\u2019s a video with a Ukrainian POW taken in this sector claiming to be from a battalion of the newly formed 141st Infantry Brigade.\n\nKherson sector / Dnipro River. Specifically, the disputed Krynky bridgehead. The situation is not rosy for the Ukrainians, under constant fire from Russian artillery and KABs, but it\u2019s also not as exaggerated as some articles make it out to be and the Russians are having very powerful migraines to fix this situation, resulting in heavy human and material losses for them. Both sides are making massive use of EW systems to thwart the enemy's FPV drones.  The Russians estimate that there are about 200 Ukrainians in Krynky at any given time. Elements of the 37th and 38th Marine Brigades went into action in December, after previously the actions were carried out by elements of the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades (let\u2019s recall that a part of the battalions of these brigades are actually in the rear reconstituting after the battles of the summer in the Velyka Novosilka sector). DeepState also mentioned elements of the TDF which were deployed in Krinnky but I don\u2019t know which ones. The Ukrainian presence in Krynky has been going on for more than two months and the Russians continue to be unable to drive the Ukrainians out. One factor that helps the Ukrainians a lot, or rather was listed by them as the only reason the bridghead still exists, is the fact that its \"boundaries\" have been really heavily mined, which spoils the constant Russian mechanized attacks.\n\nAs I understand it, minor and local commanders lied to Teplinsky, who therefore failed to have the fullest understanding of events, despite being objectively one of the best generals Russia can boast. During December Teplinsky took the matter into his own hands and ordered mechanized attacks against the village, which ended with a small reduction of the area under Ukrainian control and the loss of several T-72B3s and BMD-2/4s of the 328th Air Assault Regiment. The latter and elements of the 337th Air Assault Regiment, both of them belonging to the new 104th VDV Division (formed by reforming the 31st VDV Brigade) are in action against the Ukrainian presence in Krynky. Today the action is mainly in the hands of the VDV, after in October the 144th Motorized Brigade of the 40th Corps and the 26th Motorized Regiment of the 70th Motorized Division of the 22nd Army had been mainly involved, and in November battalions of marines from the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, from the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment of the Caspian Flotilla and probably from the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade of the Arctic Fleet. A convict from a Storm Z unit of the 83rd VDV Brigade was also captured, but it\u2019s too early to say that elements of this brigade were transferred here, as Storm Z units are not organic to a unit/formation but only attached to it.\n\nMashovets, who is far from bombastic when talking about Russian losses, wrote that it\u2019s known for certain that there were rotations between subunits of the 104th VDV Division because of the losses around Krynky. And they were the last ones arriving in Krynky. In any case, I consider it likely that sooner or later the Ukrainians will withdraw from Krynky altogether, perhaps to prepare for a new attack along the Dnipro. The objective is certainly not to gain a permanent bridgehead or to advance, which would be and always has been impossible for the Ukrainian capabilities, but to maintain a Russian grouping as strong as possible along the Dnipro that thus cannot be deployed elsewhere. The deployment of the 104th VDV Division here is indeed telling. The Russian grouping along the Dnipro has, after all, reached 73k men, an all-time high, after that during the summer it was a basin from which to draw reserves for the sectors affected by the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nThat's all.

I'll welcome any constructive correction **provided that** it's well reasoned and either comes with sources or comes from someone with directly relevant credentials.\n\nWith that said:\n\nOh, huh, if it's dumb shells then the issue raised in my above comment is pretty much unavoidable. \n\n...Damn, that'd be stupid and pointless; I mean, a minefield is a large enough target that you could already fire mortars and artillery at it. \n\nThing is, that 1000m range isn't super helpful unless the problem is that the minefield is being defended by direct fire that you're unable to get rid of... and if so, I mean, you've got bigger problems? It wouldn't do a whole hell of a lot in the Ukraine theatre, because the artillery covering the minefield doesn't really care about a kilometre more or less. You'd be better off to just suppress the artillery for long enough to make the breach with MICLICs and move your armor through it.\n\nObviously *that's* easier said than done, as we've seen over the past twelve months, but I don't see that stacking your armor up inside artillery range for ten or twenty times as long while you ineffectually shoot mortars at mines is going to help - especially since you now don't have a verifiably clear pathway and can lose any vehicle at any point while moving through the minefield. Oh, and also you're relying on your drone to stay airborne, which - as per Russia/Ukraine, again - is not very likely, *especially* if your opposition knows that your ability to breach minefields relies on drones and has placed suitable anti-drone/EW assets covering the minefield.\n\nHopefully the US MIC is not this stupid, and my layman's objections are poorly informed, and they've already solved all these issues. Having said that, enough projects crash and burn that I'm not happy to blindly assume that they know what they're doing.",

I&#39;ll welcome any constructive correction <strong>provided that</strong> it&#39;s well reasoned and either comes with sources or comes from someone with directly relevant credentials.</p>\n\n<p>With that said:</p>\n\n<p>Oh, huh, if it&#39;s dumb shells then the issue raised in my above comment is pretty much unavoidable. </p>\n\n<p>...Damn, that&#39;d be stupid and pointless; I mean, a minefield is a large enough target that you could already fire mortars and artillery at it. </p>\n\n<p>Thing is, that 1000m range isn&#39;t super helpful unless the problem is that the minefield is being defended by direct fire that you&#39;re unable to get rid of... and if so, I mean, you&#39;ve got bigger problems? It wouldn&#39;t do a whole hell of a lot in the Ukraine theatre, because the artillery covering the minefield doesn&#39;t really care about a kilometre more or less. You&#39;d be better off to just suppress the artillery for long enough to make the breach with MICLICs and move your armor through it.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously <em>that&#39;s</em> easier said than done, as we&#39;ve seen over the past twelve months, but I don&#39;t see that stacking your armor up inside artillery range for ten or twenty times as long while you ineffectually shoot mortars at mines is going to help - especially since you now don&#39;t have a verifiably clear pathway and can lose any vehicle at any point while moving through the minefield. Oh, and also you&#39;re relying on your drone to stay airborne, which - as per Russia/Ukraine, again - is not very likely, <em>especially</em> if your opposition knows that your ability to breach minefields relies on drones and has placed suitable anti-drone/EW assets covering the minefield.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully the US MIC is not this stupid, and my layman&#39;s objections are poorly informed, and they&#39;ve already solved all these issues. Having said that, enough projects crash and burn that I&#39;m not happy to blindly assume that they know what they&#39;re doing.</p>\n</div>",

Not even remotely.  \n\n\nNone of the Dutch F16's are in a condition I would describe as \"Tip Top\". They're all practically at the end of their usable service lives with many being gradually and forcibly phased out as they exceeded the maximum flight hours or developed irreparable airworthiness faults. The Dutch have been retiring them for years now and not entirely willingly either, their F-35 deliveries are still lacking and despite this they've been standing down F16 squadrons ahead of schedule. There is only one squadron left based out of Volkel and just last year before a readiness exercise they only had 24 flight capable F16's, and that was described as an unprecedentedly high number...  Approximately a month and a half later they had slumped to only 4 air worthy airframes...   \n\n\nThese are F16's operating at the last limit of the envelope of their service lives, incredible pieces of machinery, but describing them as \"Tip Top\" is a joke.   \n\n\nThis is a retirement and out-to-pasture of necessity which might explain why they're willing (along with other countries in identical positions, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, **all original export partners of the same batch of heavily used F16's**) to offload these airframes.  \n\n\nThe Dutch F16's saw heavy use practically the entire time, Yugoslavia, Operation Enduring Freedom, various middle east deployments some even recently all with very high sortie rates racking up long hours on the airframes, and this was coming off a high operational tempo during the Cold War too when the Dutch air force had a much bigger relative budget.  \n\n\nLuckily despite the Netherlands offloading close to 150 airframes via export and losses to accidents over the last few decades the remaining 42 or so airframes were **all recipients of the MLU program**, so there's that at least, even if functionally they're still pretty long in the tooth they should have good weapons integration which is the most important factor to consider for Ukraine *as it opens up a lot of interesting options and deep inventories* that will help relieve pressure on their existing AD network.   \n\n\nDelivering any large number of these also relies upon all of these airframes being both air worthy and serviceable long term. There's no point in counting an F16 that has a critical airframe failure half a week into Ukrainian service, so it remains to be seen on this front given we already know many of these F16's being donated have seen very long service lives, these were some of the first F16's to be exported outside of the US. To be clear any number of F16's is a benefit to Ukraine, but I personally think the devil is going to be in the details on these airframes and I guess we'll see how much blood from the stone Ukraine can bleed regarding their remaining flight hours and airworthiness given they'll probably use them until they drop.   \n\n\nEither way this is another step in the right direction and it's good to see that despite the complexity of these transfers the various obstacles are not completely impassable. They're certainly taking a long time, but the groundwork is in place to move forwards.  \n\n\nGoing to be really interesting to see what the true number of usable airframes are from this pledged 42. The initial donation of 18 is sounding suspiciously similar to the maximal **18 airframes** the Dutch promised to the EFTC program and the Romanian training centre for Ukrainian pilots. If that number of airframes is the same because it's the *same airframes* then it indicates that these first 18 airframes will likely still only be used for training, even if they are technically owned by Ukraine, as pulling them away from EFTC isn't really an option. Those airframes are going to remain at the EFTC base to provide training to both Ukrainian *and* *Romanian* pilots.  \n\n\nThe Dutch also already sent five F16's to the EFTC, which would indicate perhaps (if they are the same airframes) that they're actually going to be shipping an additional 13 airframes outside of the Netherlands as opposed to 18.  \n\n\nI don't know, could just be a coincidence, but the number is remarkably similar to the absolute maximum commitment they had already described, which doesn't precisely bode well for the airworthiness of the remaining 24 airframes especially with the context of this trade minister bringing up whether some of the F16's are even flight capable... Saying you'll deliver anything that can fly and not giving a definitive number on the F16's outside of \"18\", to me at least, implies that 18 are the current number of actually flight worthy F16's of their stored 42...",

I have no idea if this is accurate, but at least it seems better material for discussion than anything else I've seen.\n\n> What happened to the Gaza City and Northern Brigade of alQassam? According to conversations, videos, and other reports, the following:\n\n> Many fighters were killed in Israeli strikes before and in the days of the invasion. Many were killed along with their families when the Israelis targeted their homes or bombarded underground positions.\n\n> Then, when the Israelis invaded Wadi Gaza along Juhur ad Dik axis, communication with the leadership in Khan Younis with alQassam units in the North was hindered as Gaza was cut in half. This loss of communication, combined with the deaths of many of the battalion commmanders (and also the northern Brigade commader) left many alQassam fighters without direction and with personal choices to make.\n\n> Military commentators note that since the start of the Israeli invasion, alQassam Gaza City and Northern Gaza Brigades combined succeeded in carrying out only two company-level attacks on the Israelis. The 1st attack occurred at the outset of the invasion at the end of October when a combined weapons attack targeted an armoured vehicle north of Beit Lahiya & killed an entire squad of infantry. The 2nd occurred in alShujaiya days ago and involved multiple boobytraps and attacks. Besides these events, all of the attacks against the Israelis were carried out at the squad level, and not according to the years of defense preparations by these brigades which called for larger forces and more dramatic attacks.\n\n> The main evidence comes from AlQassam media unit: AlQassam fighters have a directive not to launch attacks against the Israelis unless they can capture them on video with body cameras. If there is no camera, they do not fight. Therefore all of the published videos from alQassam show groups of 2-4 fighters only staging hit and run attacks using mainly 105mm Yassin missiles and not large scale attacks that they planned for which cal for booby traps, sniper, rocket, and then raid to snatch bodies. And footage of the attacks from areas under responsibility of the Gaza City and Northern brigades, which once had over 15000 fighters dwindled to one or two a day in recent weeks.\n\nThe surprising thing to me here is that while Hamas has allegedly \"succeeded in carrying out only two company-level attacks\", otherwise \"all of the attacks against the Israelis were carried out at the squad level\". Does that mean they are 2 for 2 with company-level attacks? I would have expected that every attack is more likely to fail than succeed, so you run lots of company-level attacks and if enough of them succeed then you're in good shape overall. Given that Hamas does not appear to be in good shape overall in northern Gaza, the ratio should be even lower.\n\nNevertheless in the big picture, it does seem highly plausible to me that many Hamas units are unable to communicate and coordinate with others, and that is hurting their effectiveness.",

I think it\u2019s a pretty clear message that Iran is willing, able, and capable of expanding the tanker / economic war beyond the Yemeni coast and Red Sea. The west / US only has so many ships, and only so much political will to commit. I think the strike being ~200nm from Iran off the coast of India is a further example of this- sure, a western coalition can put together a task force dedicated to a specific geographic area in order to prevent Houthi strikes on shipping lanes, but can they or will they do the same vs Iran, or the wider geographic area Iran is directly able to threaten?\n\nThe western world hasn\u2019t even acted decisively vs a non-state actor like the Houthis (and yes I\u2019m fully aware that the Houthi attacks are almost definitely supplied by, funded by, supported by, and at the behest of Iran). The Houthis actions are an egregious violation of freedom of navigation, something that is a cornerstone of the western liberal world order, and literally part of the job description of the US Navy to assure. Prosperity Guardian seems to be- at least as of right now- purely defensive and reactionary, ie they\u2019re waiting until the Houthis have launched drones, missiles, etc before they intercepting, and not being proactive by striking the launch locations, infrastructure, personnel etc. And that\u2019s not even to take into consideration the opportunity cost of using something like a multimillion dollar SM-6 to blast a ~$20k suicide drone out of the air- but I digress because defense economics aren\u2019t really my thing so I\u2019ll wait until Perun makes a video about it.\n\nAnyways- if a western coalition won\u2019t even act decisively against a non-state actor like the Houthis directly and repeatedly endangering one of the worlds most important shipping lanes- what will they do vs a state actor like Iran?\n\nNow this is all my opinion, but we\u2019re living in a time where the US and west at large keep on \u201cshowing their ass\u201d as it were on the international stage, and this is emboldening actors like Iran that don\u2019t want to play by the rules of the western world order to continue taking bolder and bolder escalatory steps.

A single look at the map of the Mediterranean shows that a vessel that would be trying to go to Europe or through Turkey would have to take a far different trajectory to a vessel trying to go to Israel, such that you could easily just publicize a killzone from slightly past Port Said to Cyprus to Lebanon which any vessel going anywhere except Lebanon and Israel would never have to pass through. This is not true for the Red Sea, obviously, so collateral damage is not a serious concern there. The only question is whether Israel would be able to stop it, and the answer is maybe now, probably not in ten years, so this is a clear strategic threat. \n\nYou still haven't been able to state what the consequences are. So far, the Houthis haven't suffered any consequce. The threat of Israeli bombing is not credible, because Israel does not have enough firepower to do it - the Saudis failed with the same size of air force but literally 8x less distance. Going missile hunting would be unlikely to work, so unless Israel gave up on that pretense and just went for civilian targets, it's not clear to me that it would be able to do so much damage that it would be strongly dissuasive. It certainly didn't work in Syria, either. Then there is also the issue of overflight, what's the geopolitical damage that Saudi Arabia and Egypt would encounter if they allowed overflight?

What is NATO\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s dangerous rhetoric around nuclear, chemical and biological weapons?  \n>  \n>Russia\u2019s threatening nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible. NATO takes these threats seriously, but will not be intimidated. NATO remains vigilant and conveys a clear message to Russia that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought.

Not only are there a lot of tunnels (some connected, some just connecting a few buildings) but Hamas has setup their defensive infrastructure in a way that makes the inspection and then clearing of every single house necessary. \n\nSo while the IDF may be clearing a house from IEDs they also have to be on the lookout for tunnel exits because at any moment Hamas fighters could appear and attack. \n\nIsrael is also less fighting for territory (there isn\u2018t a lot anyway) but to destroy Hamas infrastructure and capture and kill Hamas operatives. \n\nOn the other hand there is also not a lot of pressure to speed up the operation. Israel is now able to release the first reservists after having cleared some neighborhoods in Gaza City. This reduces pressure. Also US diplomatic support is way more stable than a lot of people expected.

Not only are there a lot of tunnels (some connected, some just connecting a few buildings) but Hamas has setup their defensive infrastructure in a way that makes the inspection and then clearing of every single house necessary. </p>\n\n<p>So while the IDF may be clearing a house from IEDs they also have to be on the lookout for tunnel exits because at any moment Hamas fighters could appear and attack. </p>\n\n<p>Israel is also less fighting for territory (there isn\u2018t a lot anyway) but to destroy Hamas infrastructure and capture and kill Hamas operatives. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand there is also not a lot of pressure to speed up the operation. Israel is now able to release the first reservists after having cleared some neighborhoods in Gaza City. This reduces pressure. Also US diplomatic support is way more stable than a lot of people expected. Going so far to prevent the UN from calling for a ceasefire. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly the end goal of this operations is currently the occupation of most parts of Gaza.

Granted, it's a bit outdated now (warning of Russian solidifying lines in the south under the 'ceasefire', which they *actually did* even without it), but other 'warnings' still ring true apparently, even for 'peace'.\n\n[ISW: The Risks of a Russian Ceasefire Offer, Mar 31, 2022](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/risks-russian-ceasefire-offer):\n\n> Ukraine may soon face a new threat in this war\u2014Russia\u2019s ceasefire offer. It seems odd to say that a ceasefire is a threat. Once war begins, the default position in the West is to seize the earliest opportunity to \u201cstop the fighting.\u201d But while some ceasefires lead to peace, others lead to more war\u2014as the Russians have repeatedly shown. The frontlines frozen in a ceasefire set the conditions for the negotiations and reconstruction that follow. They also set conditions for future conflict. Those seeking enduring peace in Ukraine must resist the temptation to accept a Russian ceasefire offer that sets conditions for renewed conflict on Russia\u2019s terms or gives Russia leverage on Ukraine with which to force concessions and surrenders.\n\n> ...\n\n> Russia has a long history of ceasefire violations. Russia regularly violated ceasefires in Syria and framed its troop rotations as \u201cwithdrawals\u201d to buy time for its military operations, as ISW analyzed in detail.[[2]](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISW%20Report%20-%20Russia%E2%80%99s%20Dead-End%20Diplomacy%20in%20Syria%20-%20November%202019.pdf)\n\n> The Kremlin has also repeatedly violated ceasefire agreements in Ukraine since 2014.[3] Russia exploited ceasefires in attempts to manipulate Ukraine in Russia-favorable peace frameworks.[4] A ceasefire with Russia can only be acceptable, therefore, if it freezes the lines in positions favorable to Ukraine. The ceasefire must reflect a Russian defeat, not a draw.\n\n> ...\n\n> Russian forces would use a ceasefire to regroup. Ukraine has forced Russia to slow and scale back some of its efforts but there is no indication that Russia has defined down its overall military objectives\u2014despite the rhetoric about concentrating on Ukraine\u2019s east.[7]\n\n> ...\n\n> The Kremlin will use a ceasefire to introduce ambiguity in the information space. The Kremlin is on the defensive in the information space domestically and globally, where Ukraine has a clear advantage. The Kremlin would use a ceasefire to put Ukraine\u2019s forces on the defensive in the information space by blaming Ukraine for any ceasefire violations.\n\nAgain, judging by both the general knowledge of Russia so far and the 'zeal', as is alluded to in the article, with which Putin has embarked on this misadventure, the 'peace' offer should be taken, in my humble opinion', **only** as a chance to further rearm the Ukranian Army and consolidate the defensive lines even further. All other actions, in my humble opinion again, are risking giving Russia the advantage further down the line. \n\nI personally don't believe he's ready to end this, or as it's referred to in the article:\n\n> \u201cPutin and the Russian army, they don\u2019t want to stretch their capacity further\u201d\n\nHe even seems way too relaxed, from the article:\n\n> A person present recalled Mr. Putin\u2019s calm confidence and relaxed body language.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like a man who\u2019s waging war,\u201d the person said.",

The IDF then allegedly ordered the women and children into a room, and either shot at them or threw a grenade into the room, reportedly seriously injuring some of them, including an infant and a child. OHCHR has confirmed the killings at Al Awdabuilding, although the details and circumstances of the killings are still under verification.** IDF has not released any information on the incident.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\n[Israel responded on X](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-779126) (formerly known as Twitter) today by calling the OHCHR's allegations \"unfounded and devoid of truth\". It claimed to have carried out an investigation which provided \"no record of any operation, nor incident, in the Al Remal neighborhood in Gaza City that would support any of the allegations put forward by OHCHR.\"\n\nI posted this a few hours ago in yesterday's thread but it might've been too late to drive discussion. \n\nTo add to this: \n\nOHCHR could confirm that 11 people were killed inside the Al Awda building - this is important because it demonstrates that they've not taken EuroMed Human Rights Monitor or just the witnesses simply at their word. (Not that witness or NGO testimony prima facie isn't good enough for such incidents, it typically is but discussion surrounding this conflict tends to be charged)  \n\nThe IDF claims no such operation ever occurred in Al Remal. This is rather peculiar. How were those 11 people killed then?",

Don't read into it.\n\n- Your point is a tower of hypotheticals, which serve no constructive purpose. We would need:\n\t- Western support to Ukraine to end\n\t- Russia to slowly grind through Ukraine for 2-3 years (with support not returning)\n\t- Russia to ignore historic strategic desires, history etc. (which led to Ukraine) and beeline for 2 relatively unimportant countries, which it has hardly interacted with\n\t\t- minimal panslavism , which died out after a few decades in the late 19th century (note how the USSR didn't seek to incorporate Warsaw Pact members, even when Bulgaria requested to join)\n\t\t- putting down the Hungarian 48ers at Austria's request\n\t- Attacking these two (slightly) friendlier states, instead of... foes\n\t- NATO to not support these member states and collapse\n\n- That is extremely farfetched. It becomes \"partisan hate mongering\" (poor word choice on my part) when you consider any semblance of reason and feasibility as irrelevant, because your mental model of Russia is aggressive to all, wanting to conquer and threaten everyone etc. etc. Yes, the Russian regime is guilty of grievous crimes, no, this regime can't ignore base reality.\n\n----\n\n> Granted, it wasn't a particularly insightful high-effort post, but was it really below the average quality of this sub?\n\nPlease be better.

Also, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could provide a source for the information. I know the questions are very specific and hard to answer, so my thanks in advance for any info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I did some further research into the question many of you are posing, which is why would China invade India at all? Although it does seem like a lot of Indian analysts overestimate China's desire to annex territory from India, it does seem like they want at least Arunachal Pradesh, as Tawang (a town in the state) is important to the Tibetan people, especially with the Dalai Lama's succession affair going on.

Thanks to the Oil Embargo, RVN suffered crippling hyperinflation, couldn't even pay their troops, while the US cut them off from most of their POL requirements. In Afghanistan, the rotary wing aviation that was absolutely critical to move troops, perform resupply, evacuate casualties, perform close air support, was essentially grounded within two weeks of the US withdrawal because all the contractors took off and nobody was left who could keep them flyable.\n\nIf the \"right\" things happens to Ukraine, namely they keep taking heavy losses while suffering a manpower crisis (like they are right now), and they get cut off of sufficient foreign aid (like they are right now), there will be a cascading snowball effect of tactical defeats and heavy losses that will exponentially get worse and very well could trigger a rapid national collapse if the Russians can react faster and better than the UA govt. \n\nThe other poster was right.

They lost more each year than all of NATO in the entire war. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s pretty hard to maintain morale and combat effectiveness in such situations, especially when critical necessities dry up too. Thanks to the Oil Embargo, RVN suffered crippling hyperinflation, couldn&#39;t even pay their troops, while the US cut them off from most of their POL requirements. In Afghanistan, the rotary wing aviation that was absolutely critical to move troops, perform resupply, evacuate casualties, perform close air support, was essentially grounded within two weeks of the US withdrawal because all the contractors took off and nobody was left who could keep them flyable.</p>\n\n<p>If the &quot;right&quot; things happens to Ukraine, namely they keep taking heavy losses while suffering a manpower crisis (like they are right now), and they get cut off of sufficient foreign aid (like they are right now), there will be a cascading snowball effect of tactical defeats and heavy losses that will exponentially get worse and very well could trigger a rapid national collapse if the Russians can react faster and better than the UA govt. </p>\n\n<p>The other poster was right. When defeats happen in war, as in collapses, they&#39;re usually pretty rapid. Things go from had to catastrophic pretty quickly, enough to catch many by surprise, even the victorious sides are often left surprised at the end.</p>\n</div>",
