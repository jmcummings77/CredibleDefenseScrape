        "body": "Yet another (short, in this case) account on the problems during the start of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, by an UAV operator from the 47th Mechanized Brigade, reported by the \"WarArchive\" Telegram Channel.\n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/8150\n\nI translated it with DeepL and will entirely put it below. The only thing I will add is that it would be nice to have similar interviews/reports from Russian personnel being honest about the problems of their offensive actions (save for some milbloggers throwing a tantrum once in a while); on the contrary, it seems that Ukrainians, particularly in the 47th Brigade, have no problem telling everyone everything.\n\n>We saw the preparations with training, planning and the assaults themselves. I think both our allies and our command are responsible for the failure. It is difficult to conduct strategic operations with 30-50% of the required equipment and no air superiority.\nOn the other hand, knowing your resources, you need to build on them, not disperse the already limited forces.\n\n>There was indeed a plan to reach Tokmak in 3 days, but more on that later. Let's start from the beginning.\nWe went through all possible training grounds, exercises, courses and headed south. We were forbidden to interact with anyone in order not to burn our presence. Spoiler alert, two weeks before the counteroffensive, the enemy already knew where each brigade was, the number of vehicles and personnel.\n\n>Did we know about enemy forces, fortifications and minefields? Yes, of course. The National Guard, which had been holding the frontline here for a year, knew every bush, every landing, and any ordinary soldier could show us firing points, enemy positions, and provide us with photos of minefields from copters.\n\n>A week before the offensive, we conduct night and day firing on the enemy's fortified areas, massive artillery strikes that we adjust daily. There is practically no response, for 20 of our shots, 1 enemy shell arrives. We were made to understand that there are a lot of 82 and 120 mm, 155 mm is practically unlimited.\nBut still we were preparing for Forward Forward.\n\n>Two days before the active phase, we receive a general plan from the command, which provides for a 10-kilometer advance in the first 12 hours at best. At worst, 5 kilometers. In one day, we had to break through the first line of enemy defense, bypass Robotyno and Novopokropivka, and prepare a bridgehead for the next brigades to take Tokmak. We realized that the command wanted Kharkiv 2.0. Was it possible with our forces? British intelligence thought it was 50/50.\n\n>When we asked, \"What is the plan if something goes wrong?\" We were told \"The corps command has a plan B\". We had to interact with at least 5 more brigades that I know about, two brigades of the Offensive Guard and three mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The corridor was to be opened for another corps.\n\n>Spoiler alert - everything went wrong, spoiler alert - there was no plan B. An interesting fact is that, according to the \"elephant\" [military rumors], the first Leopard destroyed was not by Russians, but by the National Guard. But it was the Leopard and its command that were wrong. I repeat, it was just an elephant.\n\n>So, we have up to 10 brigades that should quickly break through the front to a depth of 20-30 kilometers. Most of the brigades are newly created. The equipment is mostly Western. The fighters are motivated and mostly trained.\nHowever, this time the God of War turned his back on us, and everything did not go according to plan.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Yet another (short, in this case) account on the problems during the start of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, by an UAV operator from the 47th Mechanized Brigade, reported by the &quot;WarArchive&quot; Telegram Channel.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/WarArchive_ua/8150</p>\n\n<p>I translated it with DeepL and will entirely put it below. The only thing I will add is that it would be nice to have similar interviews/reports from Russian personnel being honest about the problems of their offensive actions (save for some milbloggers throwing a tantrum once in a while); on the contrary, it seems that Ukrainians, particularly in the 47th Brigade, have no problem telling everyone everything.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We saw the preparations with training, planning and the assaults themselves. I think both our allies and our command are responsible for the failure. It is difficult to conduct strategic operations with 30-50% of the required equipment and no air superiority.\nOn the other hand, knowing your resources, you need to build on them, not disperse the already limited forces.</p>\n\n<p>There was indeed a plan to reach Tokmak in 3 days, but more on that later. Let&#39;s start from the beginning.\nWe went through all possible training grounds, exercises, courses and headed south. We were forbidden to interact with anyone in order not to burn our presence. Spoiler alert, two weeks before the counteroffensive, the enemy already knew where each brigade was, the number of vehicles and personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Did we know about enemy forces, fortifications and minefields? Yes, of course.

                    "body": "Definitely need a second echelon to exploit the breakthrough, but they need enough forces to conduct the assault to create that breakthrough in the first place. Considering the defenses and the number of defenders, it was nearly a 1:1 ratio when they attacked. 3:1 isn't a real rule, more of a vague guideline, but the attacker needs to be able to overwhelm the defenders in order to succeed. \n\nThe 1:1 ratio was actually probably less, since numerous credible sources familiar with that UAF assault around Orihkiv in particular noted that the battalion/brigade command and staff officers weren't competent enough to have more than 2-3 maneuver companies per brigade fighting at any given time, they were overwhelmed when it was anymore of them. To put that in perspective, the 47th Mech Brigade has 15 maneuver companies in it, which means at any given time only 13-20% of the assault force was even involved in the attack (each maneuver unit tasked with a role in the combined arms breach is supposed to have different roles: breach, assault, support). \n\nAdditionally, the UAF were supposedly low on engineering equipment. If so, they definitely need to mass what they have in as few places as possible, to create redundancy at the points of breach they selected for their main effort. Instead they were doing attacks and breaches of the security zone all along Zap. Oblast sector over a broad front (all the way to the West near the Dnieper River, and then 2-3 brigades abreast for the Orikhiv Axis), then with a supporting effort not doing a fixing attack but a legitimate deep breakthrough attempt at the Velyka Novosilka axis with about 3-4 brigades abreast, and then 2-3 brigades abreast in Bakhmut, which also seemed like more than just a fixing operation (lots of talking points of \"de-occupying Bakhmut\"). All of those other operations required significant engineering support, so they dispersed that strength too. \n\nFor a second let's forget massing maneuver or direct combat support like engineers, and talk about fires. To start off their offensive, Ukraine was sitting on mountains of artillery ammo, the South Korean handover netted them over 300k shells just in time for their offensive to start. A long term lesson for artillery support is to have the most amount of pieces firing the most amount of ammo in the shortest time possible to do the most damage. That requires HEAVY massing of fires. But the UAF didn't have enough pieces to properly support the Orikhiv axis, we know that because there were constant reports of objectives not at all even suppressed as attacks were being done, or positions hit that suffered light damage where they were planned to be destroyed, etc. Which is understandable, they only had artillery battalions that organic to each maneuver brigade, plus a single separate artillery brigade, to support their main effort. But they had WAY more available, just not supporting their main effort. Ukraine has about a dozen separate artillery brigades, over half were supporting operations in the East, mainly Kupyansk and Bakhmut, while two were supporting the Velyka Novosilka axis. \n\nThe reality is that offensive didn't follow any known doctrine. Not US, not NATO, not Soviet, not Russia, and not even Ukraine (because they massed big time with their best units for their [Sept 2022 Kharkiv axis counteroffensive](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcVE8FYXoAEtpHU?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)). \n\nIt was just a really bad plan that fully hinged on the best case scenario for the UAF: the Russians defenses wouldn't hold, they'd be broken through easily and defending forces would be routed. The Russian strategic reserves, heavily attrited due to Bakhmut, would be committed quickly all over Ukraine due to the broad front attacks, which wouldn't help the main effort because they'd be forced to commit them to three different strategic locations, all suffering successful UAF breakthrough and exploitations. That would cause a cascading effect, so what happened at Kharkiv last year would happen in all major fronts. \n\nI'm not even exaggerating, that assumption about Russian strength and resolve is what the plan seems to have been based on. This was the second worst plan of the war, the first being the Russian invasion.\\* \n\n\\*The UAF plan for the defense of the initial invasion should be up there too as one of the worst, but the reality is I don't think they even had a real plan for defending their country. Considering they didn't even really have a plan, the UAF defense in the first month was that much more impressive. One wonders if they'd have done better or potentially worse if they did have a plan...",

Instead they were doing attacks and breaches of the security zone all along Zap. Oblast sector over a broad front (all the way to the West near the Dnieper River, and then 2-3 brigades abreast for the Orikhiv Axis), then with a supporting effort not doing a fixing attack but a legitimate deep breakthrough attempt at the Velyka Novosilka axis with about 3-4 brigades abreast, and then 2-3 brigades abreast in Bakhmut, which also seemed like more than just a fixing operation (lots of talking points of &quot;de-occupying Bakhmut&quot;). All of those other operations required significant engineering support, so they dispersed that strength too. </p>\n\n<p>For a second let&#39;s forget massing maneuver or direct combat support like engineers, and talk about fires. To start off their offensive, Ukraine was sitting on mountains of artillery ammo, the South Korean handover netted them over 300k shells just in time for their offensive to start. A long term lesson for artillery support is to have the most amount of pieces firing the most amount of ammo in the shortest time possible to do the most damage. That requires HEAVY massing of fires. But the UAF didn&#39;t have enough pieces to properly support the Orikhiv axis, we know that because there were constant reports of objectives not at all even suppressed as attacks were being done, or positions hit that suffered light damage where they were planned to be destroyed, etc. Which is understandable, they only had artillery battalions that organic to each maneuver brigade, plus a single separate artillery brigade, to support their main effort. But they had WAY more available, just not supporting their main effort. Ukraine has about a dozen separate artillery brigades, over half were supporting operations in the East, mainly Kupyansk and Bakhmut, while two were supporting the Velyka Novosilka axis. </p>\n\n<p>The reality is that offensive didn&#39;t follow any known doctrine. Not US, not NATO, not Soviet, not Russia, and not even Ukraine (because they massed big time with their best units for their <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcVE8FYXoAEtpHU?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096\">Sept 2022 Kharkiv axis counteroffensive</a>). </p>\n\n<p>It was just a really bad plan that fully hinged on the best case scenario for the UAF: the Russians defenses wouldn&#39;t hold, they&#39;d be broken through easily and defending forces would be routed. The Russian strategic reserves, heavily attrited due to Bakhmut, would be committed quickly all over Ukraine due to the broad front attacks, which wouldn&#39;t help the main effort because they&#39;d be forced to commit them to three different strategic locations, all suffering successful UAF breakthrough and exploitations. That would cause a cascading effect, so what happened at Kharkiv last year would happen in all major fronts. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not even exaggerating, that assumption about Russian strength and resolve is what the plan seems to have been based on. This was the second worst plan of the war, the first being the Russian invasion.* </p>\n\n<p>*The UAF plan for the defense of the initial invasion should be up there too as one of the worst, but the reality is I don&#39;t think they even had a real plan for defending their country. Considering they didn&#39;t even really have a plan, the UAF defense in the first month was that much more impressive. One wonders if they&#39;d have done better or potentially worse if they did have a plan...</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "If aid doesn\u2019t continue/increase at past predicted rates, then Ukraine cannot fight on in the first place. This wound is entirely self inflicted by the western Allies. An increasing ramp up in vehicles and munitions would have put continuous pressure on the Russians. The Russians are still bashing their heads into a wall with enormous casualties as we speak, but the west just chooses to wallow in defeatism, incessant finger pointing, and political infighting. \n\nWhat I feared the most from the beginning was the us making the same damn mistakes as the ones we made in the 2nd sino Japanese war (which is a war that has quite a lot of parallels with Ukraine today). That war is still very poorly understood in the us, and the actions of us politicians have been completely forgotten. The us entered ww2 with an incredibly poor understanding of China. We only knew that we had to support Chiang\u2019s kmt because he was fighting japan and was anti communist. China during the war was in a much worse shape than even Ukraine today, as japan overran the entire Chinese coast and took most of the major population centers. The kmt was forced to retreat into sichuan while the communists hid in northern shaanxi. \n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, we sent general Joseph Stilwell to act as personal advisor and liaison to chiang, and began lend lease to China. However, japan had overwhelmed the British in Burma, and closed the last major land route into Free China, forcing much of the aid to be flown in through the Himalayas. Now this aid was important in keeping the kmt alive (china had no major industries left), but it was nowhere near enough for the KMT to go on a major counteroffensive. Yet Stilwell and a large chunk of us politicians continue to dream of a grand Chinese offensive to take back the coast (this is not to mention that Stilwell hoarded the vast majority of lend lease for his Chinese troops in India). \n\nThe us government continued to have a very poor understanding of China (sound familiar?) during the war, and had to rely on a small circle of people known as the China hands for information. As a result, much of the history was written through their personal beliefs. Meanwhile, the Chinese front continued to deteriorate as Free China saw massive hyperinflation, culminating in the KMT losing large swaths of land during operation ichi go in 1944 (a time when the axis was losing land in every other front). The U.S. government however, wasn\u2019t interested in understanding the economic hardship or the chaotic factions that chiang had to deal with. The KMT had already suffered enormous losses for 7 years, but the us was more interested in knowing if lend lease was being wasted, and why chiang and the communists can\u2019t just \u201cget along\u201d\n\nStilwell, who was frustrated by the lack of progress, famously decided that it was a good idea to threaten chiang to hand over command of the entire Chinese army to him, or he will cut lend lease. He made a flurry of accusations about kmt corruption (many of which was true. The KMT was very corrupt, but it is also hard to quantify how much of that mattered in the grand scale of things) and the now famous myth that lasts to this day, that the KMT was hoarding lend lease and not actually interested in fighting the Japanese when compared to the communists (which was mostly bullocks). He used the few us reporters in China to drum up this sentiment, and this caused u.s. public opinion to massively turn against the KMT. Chiang went nuclear and eventually got Stilwell fired from his post, but the damage was done. \n\nAfter the kmt was defeated in the civil war, the U.S. went through the loss of China phase, in which mccarthy tried to scapegoat the China hands for communist sympathies. Stilwell conveniently died in 1946, and so he escaped all the blame. The China hands had enormous issues, chief of which was that they only saw the conflict through very selective lens and personal biases, but the U.S. panic to blame them only reflected the entire governments poor understanding and misplaced goals towards the conflict. The finger pointing went on for years until the U.S established relations with the PRC, which rehabilitated the China hands and conveniently swept the entire KMT experience of the war under the rug. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/17kh35v/how_much_did_us_general_j_stilwell_contribute_to/?rdt=50045\n\nI apologize for the ridiculously long post, but I\u2019m sensing an increasing desire within the us political establishment to cover their backs. The support for Ukraine is now muddled by political infighting, and the stories of Ukrainian corruption will only be used as post hoc justifications for us politicians to explain away their failures (and lack of will) if anything goes wrong in Ukraine. It happened 8 years ago in Ukraine with the Nazis BS. The news media ran wild with those stories, which played right into the Russians hand, and allowed the us political establishment to initially shrug and subsequently act confused when the Russians came for round two.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>If aid doesn\u2019t continue/increase at past predicted rates, then Ukraine cannot fight on in the first place. This wound is entirely self inflicted by the western Allies. An increasing ramp up in vehicles and munitions would have put continuous pressure on the Russians. The Russians are still bashing their heads into a wall with enormous casualties as we speak, but the west just chooses to wallow in defeatism, incessant finger pointing, and political infighting. </p>\n\n<p>What I feared the most from the beginning was the us making the same damn mistakes as the ones we made in the 2nd sino Japanese war (which is a war that has quite a lot of parallels with Ukraine today). That war is still very poorly understood in the us, and the actions of us politicians have been completely forgotten. The us entered ww2 with an incredibly poor understanding of China. We only knew that we had to support Chiang\u2019s kmt because he was fighting japan and was anti communist. China during the war was in a much worse shape than even Ukraine today, as japan overran the entire Chinese coast and took most of the major population centers. The kmt was forced to retreat into sichuan while the communists hid in northern shaanxi. </p>\n\n<p>After Pearl Harbor, we sent general Joseph Stilwell to act as personal advisor and liaison to chiang, and began lend lease to China. However, japan had overwhelmed the British in Burma, and closed the last major land route into Free China, forcing much of the aid to be flown in through the Himalayas. Now this aid was important in keeping the kmt alive (china had no major industries left), but it was nowhere near enough for the KMT to go on a major counteroffensive. Yet Stilwell and a large chunk of us politicians continue to dream of a grand Chinese offensive to take back the coast (this is not to mention that Stilwell hoarded the vast majority of lend lease for his Chinese troops in India). </p>\n\n<p>The us government continued to have a very poor understanding of China (sound familiar?) during the war, and had to rely on a small circle of people known as the China hands for information. As a result, much of the history was written through their personal beliefs. Meanwhile, the Chinese front continued to deteriorate as Free China saw massive hyperinflation, culminating in the KMT losing large swaths of land during operation ichi go in 1944 (a time when the axis was losing land in every other front). The U.S. government however, wasn\u2019t interested in understanding the economic hardship or the chaotic factions that chiang had to deal with. The KMT had already suffered enormous losses for 7 years, but the us was more interested in knowing if lend lease was being wasted, and why chiang and the communists can\u2019t just \u201cget along\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Stilwell, who was frustrated by the lack of progress, famously decided that it was a good idea to threaten chiang to hand over command of the entire Chinese army to him, or he will cut lend lease. He made a flurry of accusations about kmt corruption (many of which was true. The KMT was very corrupt, but it is also hard to quantify how much of that mattered in the grand scale of things) and the now famous myth that lasts to this day, that the KMT was hoarding lend lease and not actually interested in fighting the Japanese when compared to the communists (which was mostly bullocks). He used the few us reporters in China to drum up this sentiment, and this caused u.s. public opinion to massively turn against the KMT. Chiang went nuclear and eventually got Stilwell fired from his post, but the damage was done. </p>\n\n<p>After the kmt was defeated in the civil war, the U.S. went through the loss of China phase, in which mccarthy tried to scapegoat the China hands for communist sympathies. Stilwell conveniently died in 1946, and so he escaped all the blame. The China hands had enormous issues, chief of which was that they only saw the conflict through very selective lens and personal biases, but the U.S. panic to blame them only reflected the entire governments poor understanding and misplaced goals towards the conflict. The finger pointing went on for years until the U.S established relations with the PRC, which rehabilitated the China hands and conveniently swept the entire KMT experience of the war under the rug. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/17kh35v/how_much_did_us_general_j_stilwell_contribute_to/?rdt=50045\">https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/17kh35v/how_much_did_us_general_j_stilwell_contribute_to/?rdt=50045</a></p>\n\n<p>I apologize for the ridiculously long post, but I\u2019m sensing an increasing desire within the us political establishment to cover their backs. The support for Ukraine is now muddled by political infighting, and the stories of Ukrainian corruption will only be used as post hoc justifications for us politicians to explain away their failures (and lack of will) if anything goes wrong in Ukraine. It happened 8 years ago in Ukraine with the Nazis BS. The news media ran wild with those stories, which played right into the Russians hand, and allowed the us political establishment to initially shrug and subsequently act confused when the Russians came for round two. The finger pointing and scapegoating will come if anything disastrous happens to Ukraine in the next year. </p>\n\n<p>Finding sources for the Taiwanese viewpoint of ww2 has been incredibly frustrating.

Couldn&#39;t this sort of antenna be put on a USV or some other platform that can get close enough to send data to an incoming ASBM?</p>\n</div>",

Though political analysts, social media users and New York Times journalists reported sparse turnout, the government claimed that it was heavy, with 10.5 million ballots cast.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWith the inflated vote numbers, they\u2019ve just become a mockery,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, an international affairs research group in London. \u201cThings really do seem to be falling apart.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Guyana:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/helicopter-5-senior-military-officials-guyana-missing-border-105444028\">Helicopter with 5 senior military officials from Guyana goes missing near border with Venezuela</a></p>\n\n<p>A military helicopter carrying seven people vanished Wednesday near Guyana\u2019s border with Venezuela, with authorities saying there was bad weather in the area and stressing there was no indication it may have been hit by hostile fire as tensions escalate between the countries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Article continues, not paywalled. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/guyana-boosts-security-engages-us-to-defend-land-from-venezuela\">Guyana Boosts Security, Engages US to Defend Land from Venezuela</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>UN Security Council will hold closed-door meeting on crisis</li>\n<li>Guyana\u2019s defense force is on full alert as tensions escalate</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Guyana said it\u2019s intensifying security measures and engaging the US military to help it protect the oil-rich region of Essequibo, describing Venezuela\u2019s intentions to grant oil exploration licenses in the area as a threat to its territorial integrity.</p>\n\n<p>The United Nations Security Council plans to hold a closed-door meeting on the issue Friday, according to two people familiar with the matter. Both sides will have the chance to speak before the council\u2019s 15 members. Guyanese President Irfaan Ali Guyanese President Irfaan Ali said in an earlier statement that his country had asked the Security Council to take appropriate action, but no immediate decision is expected at this point, according to the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

According to Telegram-channel Baza, the body was found by a female employee of the hotel.\n> \n> \n> November 13, Lychakovsky district court of Lviv sentenced Ilya Kyva in absentia to 14 years in prison with confiscation of property. He was found guilty of calling for a violent change of power and waging war, high treason, and public use of communist symbols.\n> \n> \n> In 2019, Ilya Kyva was elected a deputy of the Rada representing the \"Opposition Platform - For Life\" party. Before that, he was a member of the Right Sector (terrorist organization banned in Russia) and headed the Socialist Party of Ukraine. According to UNIAN, shortly before the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine, the politician left the country \"under the pretext of vacationing in Europe\". Later it turned out that Ilya Kyva was in Russia.  \n\n>In March 2022, the politician was stripped of his mandate as a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, after which several criminal cases were opened against him.

Medics who arrived on a call of hotel employees were unable to resuscitate the man,&quot; - said the sources of &quot;Moskovsky Komsomolets&quot;. According to Telegram-channel Baza, the body was found by a female employee of the hotel.</p>\n\n<p>November 13, Lychakovsky district court of Lviv sentenced Ilya Kyva in absentia to 14 years in prison with confiscation of property. He was found guilty of calling for a violent change of power and waging war, high treason, and public use of communist symbols.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Ilya Kyva was elected a deputy of the Rada representing the &quot;Opposition Platform - For Life&quot; party. Before that, he was a member of the Right Sector (terrorist organization banned in Russia) and headed the Socialist Party of Ukraine. According to UNIAN, shortly before the start of Russia&#39;s military operation in Ukraine, the politician left the country &quot;under the pretext of vacationing in Europe&quot;. Later it turned out that Ilya Kyva was in Russia.  </p>\n\n<p>In March 2022, the politician was stripped of his mandate as a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, after which several criminal cases were opened against him. In April 2022, Mr. Kyva asked President Vladimir Putin to grant him Russian citizenship. The politician supported the deployment of Russian troops to the territory of Ukraine, which he repeatedly stated on the air of political shows on Russian TV channels.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>kommersant. ru/doc/6381235<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/12/6/7431925/\">https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/12/6/7431925/</a></p>\n</div>",

And this is to say nothing of the questionable reliability of Venezuela&#39;s armed forces when conducting a war of conquest in a foreign country.</p>\n</div>",

But, IMHO, IDK that Biden has paid a huge cost for it just because most Americans were already skeptical on the GWOT (Both Obama and Trump were antiwar candidates) and its kinda hard to escape the perception, true or not, that it was the ANA&#39;s fault (refused to fight) more than the US&#39;s.</p>\n\n<p>My conclusion is that Biden &#39;lost&#39; Afghanistan as a domestic political issue, but anger about it has dissipated thanks to distance and the optics of the moment. Compared to Benghazi which dogged Obama and Clinton until 2016.</p>\n</div>",

The soldiers allegedly beat and tortured the American in a Russian military compound, where he was held for 10 days in April 2022.\n\nAfter abducting him, the Russian soldiers allegedly stripped the American naked, tied his hands behind his back and beat him with their fists, feet and the stocks of their guns.\n\nWhile he was being illegally held by the Russian soldiers, the American was allegedly tortured by the four defendants and other unnamed co-defendants during at least two interrogation sessions. They stripped him naked, severely beat him and photographed him, according to the indictment.\n\nTwo of the defendants accused of war crimes against an American in Ukraine were commanding officers of the Russian Armed Forces, while the other two were lower-ranking members in the Russian army, according to the indictment unsealed Wednesday.\n\nThe indictment says the American was not fighting in the war and was a protected person under the Geneva Convention of 1949.

The soldiers allegedly beat and tortured the American in a Russian military compound, where he was held for 10 days in April 2022.</p>\n\n<p>After abducting him, the Russian soldiers allegedly stripped the American naked, tied his hands behind his back and beat him with their fists, feet and the stocks of their guns.</p>\n\n<p>While he was being illegally held by the Russian soldiers, the American was allegedly tortured by the four defendants and other unnamed co-defendants during at least two interrogation sessions. They stripped him naked, severely beat him and photographed him, according to the indictment.</p>\n\n<p>Two of the defendants accused of war crimes against an American in Ukraine were commanding officers of the Russian Armed Forces, while the other two were lower-ranking members in the Russian army, according to the indictment unsealed Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>The indictment says the American was not fighting in the war and was a protected person under the Geneva Convention of 1949. The American was not named in the indictment.</p>\n\n<p>After the American was evacuated in the summer of 2022 from Ukraine, where he lived with his wife, he told investigators with the US Department of Homeland Security about the torment he endured, according to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.</p>\n\n<p>Mayorkas said federal agents \u201ctraveled internationally to interview the victim\u2019s family.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey identified and interviewed individuals who were present within the general vicinity of Mylove around the time the victim was held in captivity, who confirmed the Russian forces\u2019 occupation in the area,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cBased on the information they obtained, the HSI agents and their FBI partners were able to identify the four defendants whose indictments are announced today.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>During the captivity, Russian soldiers allegedly threatened to kill the American, at times pointing guns to his head and a knife to his throat.

If Zelensky were hit by a bus tomorrow, it's no guarantee that his replacement would or could continue to resist, and if Putin had a heart attack and kicked it, there's no guarantee the Russian military wouldn't pull back as a result of the power struggle in Moscow.  \n\nBut until one of those things happens, I think the conflict will continue to chug along, with small gains and losses on both sides until regime change, a full military collapse (unlikely, but possible on both sides), or outside intervention (HIGHLY unlikely, imo).",

They can sit on the defensive, and wait out the West, bombing and droning to their hearts content.</p>\n\n<p>IF (hopefully when) the Ukrainian military can get their hands on effective air defenses in suitable numbers, and maybe get some aircraft that can contest the airspace, that may change.   </p>\n\n<p>I think the only thing that can definitively end this conflict is leadership change in either party.  If Zelensky were hit by a bus tomorrow, it&#39;s no guarantee that his replacement would or could continue to resist, and if Putin had a heart attack and kicked it, there&#39;s no guarantee the Russian military wouldn&#39;t pull back as a result of the power struggle in Moscow.  </p>\n\n<p>But until one of those things happens, I think the conflict will continue to chug along, with small gains and losses on both sides until regime change, a full military collapse (unlikely, but possible on both sides), or outside intervention (HIGHLY unlikely, imo).</p>\n</div>",

The Kupyiansk front is not really strategic for Ukraine at the moment.</p></li>\n<li><p>In a time where political support from the West is dwindling, such a move (framed as an operation from Russian forces) could reach western headlines and increase pressure on western governments to provide more military and financial support.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>\n</div>",
