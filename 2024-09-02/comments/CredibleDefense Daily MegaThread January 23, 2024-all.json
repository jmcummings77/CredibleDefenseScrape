From now on, there is only one country that benefits from a further delayed Swedish accession: Russia.\r  \n.\r  \nThere are two main reasons. First, there is no particular Hungarian national interest behind not allowing Sweden to join the Alliance. In fact, Hungary has never asked anything from Sweden. As a contrast, T\u00fcrkiye has conducted a tough, not always elegant, but entirely rational bargaining policy vis-a-vis the Sweden (and the U.S.), which, eventually, helped both sides achieve the expected results.\r  \nMeanwhile, Hungary has never set any particular demand vis-a-vis Sweden, nothing that could have been negotiatied about.

In fact, this would the Hungarian national interest as well, as the Alliance is the main guarantor of Hungary's security and defense.\r  \n.\r  \nMeanwhile, preventing NATO from becoming stronger, more efficient and more coherent serves only Russia's interests.\r  \n.\r  \nSecond, the NATO accession of Sweden and Finland fundamentally transforms the security environment of the Nordic-Baltic region. From Russia's perspective, this means that the Baltic Sea practically becomes a 'NATO-lake'. The Alliance will be able to deploy troops to the territories of Sweden and Finland much faster, and Moscow's earlier escalation dominance versus the two countries ceases to exist.\r  \n.\r  \nOf course, Russia has been actively reacting to these developments (the official Russian declarations on the 'insignificance' of the Finnish and Swedish accessions are no more than political stand-up comedies). Russia fundamentally needs to change its military posture in the entire region. Re-creating the old, Soviet military districts of St. Petersburg and Moscow serves this very purpose. So does the relocation of some assets of the Baltic Fleet to further east (!), onto the Lake Ladoga.\r  \nHowever, the realization of all these measures is in a serious delay; the Russian political-military apparatus is not able to complete them on time (partially due to the war in Ukraine).\r  \n.\r  \nHence, the later Sweden becomes member of NATO, the more time Moscow has for adjusting its military posture accordingly. \r  \nAt this point, by delaying Sweden's NATO membership, the Hungarian government clearly serves Russia's interests.\r  \n.\r  \nThere is no more ambiguity; there is nowhere to hide anymore.

Taiwan Navy Commander Admiral Tang Hua (\u5510\u83ef) hosted the ceremony, JSSC CEO Pi-Hsiang Han (\u97d3\u78a7\u7965) and several other navy officials attended the ceremony.*\n\n*As previously reported, the ROC Navy\u2019s project to build a new-generation 4,500-ton class frigate has stalled for various reasons, such as budget problems, wrong decisions by the Navy, and NCSIST\u2019s inability to develop an AESA radar suitable for the 4500-ton hull.*\n\n*The ROC Navy changed the purpose of the frigate project from developing a 4,500-ton frigate to building two frigates of about 2,500 tons because of the urgent need to track Chinese naval vessels and replace the aging Knox-class frigates earlier. Construction of the first ship, the anti air warfare (AAW) variant, began in November 2023.*\n\n*After the delivery of the first two prototype ships in 2026, the Taiwanese navy plans to build 10 follow-on ships and will decommission one Knox-class when all light frigates in both configuration (AAW and ASW) have been delivered.*\n\n*According to the ROC Navy\u2019s report to the Taiwanese parliament, there will be two variants of the new generation light frigate, one focusing on air defense and the other on anti-submarine warfare.*\n\n*The light frigates will be 115 meters long and have a displacement of 2,500-3,000 tons. They are classified as Tier 2 (or second class) combat ships and are set to become the workhorse of the Taiwanese Navy. They will be used to respond to situations in the \u201cgray zone\u201d, patrol the Taiwan Strait, conduct reconnaissance and surveillance missions, escort transport ships and supplies to remote islands, secure sea lines of communication, and support military exercises and training.*\n\n*Both variants of the ship were designed by Gibbs & Cox. A variation of the parent design is being proposed to Australia as reported recently by Naval News. Another variation was showcased at SNA 2024 (image above).*\n\n*The ROC Navy\u2019s light frigates will be equipped with CMS-330 Combat Management System, BAE ARTISAN radar, 76mm cannon, TC-2N SAMs, HF-3 ASMs, Phalanx Close-In Weapon System and S-70C ASW helicopters. There have been some rumors that the light frigates could be equipped with the Sea Oryx CIWS, but so far there is no information to suggest that the frigates will be equipped with Sea Oryx.*\n\n*The AAW variant of the light frigate can shoot SAMs with VLS, while the ASW variant is not equipped with VLS but shoots SAMs with fixed-angle launchers. It will also be equipped with light torpedoes launchers as well as air-launched torpedoes.*\n\n*ROC Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Chiang Cheng-kuo (\u8523\u6b63\u570b) also told MPs that the light frigates will be equipped with towed sonar, which is among the most advanced active and passive sonar in the world, but he could not say which country the system originated from.*",

There have been some rumors that the light frigates could be equipped with the Sea Oryx CIWS, but so far there is no information to suggest that the frigates will be equipped with Sea Oryx.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The AAW variant of the light frigate can shoot SAMs with VLS, while the ASW variant is not equipped with VLS but shoots SAMs with fixed-angle launchers. It will also be equipped with light torpedoes launchers as well as air-launched torpedoes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>ROC Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Chiang Cheng-kuo (\u8523\u6b63\u570b) also told MPs that the light frigates will be equipped with towed sonar, which is among the most advanced active and passive sonar in the world, but he could not say which country the system originated from.</em></p>\n</div>",

[Its actually something a lot of analysts as well as the DOD 100% have a problem with as well](https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/taiwans-defense-plans-are-going-off-the-rails/) because it's not what they were led to believe their assymetrical focused ODC plan was going to look like. \n\n A basic asw ability is required for patrol operations, but like most things they have absolutely overinvested in it and it is highly unlikely they will be able to preserve any capability within more then a few hours of a war breaking out.  PLA expenditure dwarfs Taiwanese spending by a factor of somewhere between 20-30 according to RAND (once you factor in PPP differences and civil military fusion), which is literally more then the expenditure difference between 1991 US and Iraq.  Bottom line is any significant military capability the ROC has is going to get destroyed almost immediately.",

            "body": "The Ukrainian military observer Mashovets a few months ago speculated about three possible options as an objective for a Russian offensive during 2024.\n\n1) Avdiivka\n\n2) Kupyansk\n\n3) Lyman\n\nPoint 1) is self-explanatory. It's the Russian main effort at the moment, the offensive is directed by the command of the Southern Military District in Rostov-on-Don and specifically by its 8th Army, which has reportedly carte blanche in terms of availability of men and equipment in order to fullfill the task, which, as we see, is done with total disregard of losses. And it's no coincidence that they received the 2nd and 41st Armies of the Central MD as reinforcements. The objective is political in nature, well before it is strategic.\n\nFor point 2), the Russians this summer had launched a little-known offensive, when their main effort was the defense in the Southern front, in the direction of Borova in the Svatove sector. Here the goal was to reach Borova, an important crossing town on the Oskil and cut in two the Ukrainian presence in the eastern bank. The Russians managed to cross the Zherebets (near Serhiivka/Novojehorivka) but were blocked by the Ukrainians after a few kilometers, before they reached the watershed between the Zherebets and the Oskil. After that, they intensified their actions in the Kupyansk sector, attacking in six different directions - Synkivka the most famous one, against which they have been beating their heads for months and there have been very few successes, partly due to the arrival of Ukrainian reinforcements. The Russians have the 1st Tank Army in the area, along with other formations from the Western MD. However, their successes have been underwhelming compared to the men and vehicles deployed in this area. One problem that has arisen in recent days is the breakthrough near Krokhmalne/Tabaivka, with the Russians trying to attack Berestove and Pishchane during this week. The elevation helps the Russians right there - it is possible, however, that the Ukrainians will be able to stop them in the watershed between the Pischana and the Oskil. Let's recall that the city of Kupyansk is in large majority in the western bank of the Oskil, so the Russians at this juncture would not be able to conquer the city without an action in the western bank, given the natural barrier posed by the Oskil. Overall, the situation is under control, at the moment. Potential Russian actions from Belgorod Oblast against the Kharkiv Oblast in the area between the Siversky Donets and Oskil are a very remote possibility at the moment, let alone against the city of Kharkiv itself.\n\nFor point 3), the goal is to capture the area around Lyman and Yampil, which would allow the Russians to significantly approach Sloviansk from that direction, though there is a natural barrier before the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk conurbation, posed by the Siversky Donets. Despite the fact that the Russian Group \"Center\" has been significantly weakened after sending those two armies to Avdiivka, the Russians have regained the momentum to begin developing this plan thanks to the full commitment of the 20th Army (WMD) and the recent deployment of the new 25th Army (possibly CMD) in the sector. We are seeing the first phase of this plan, with the attacks towards Terny over the past month and a half, which have been joined in recent weeks by those against Makiivka. The goal is, firstly, to cut off the Ukrainian capability to supply troops in the eastern bank of the Zherebets and eventually to occupy the entire Makiivka-Yampolivka axis, driving the Ukrainians out of the eastern bank. The second phase will be the seizure of all the Serebrianka Forest and Torske, after which they will aim towards Lyman and the eastern bank of the Oskil from the south. Although there have been successes towards the Zherebets, this plan would be very costly and would need far more troops and gear. The Ukrainian grouping in the Kreminna sector is very large and I see no scenario whereby the Russians would have any way to force the Zherebets in its southern course in the short/medium term.\n\nI add other possible targets:\n\n4) Chasiv Yar\n\n5) Siversk\n\n6) Vuhledar\n\nFor point 4), the Russians since late November have launched an offensive in the Bakhmut sector on both flanks. The Russian grouping around Bakhmut is estimated by the Ukrainians to be 80k men-strong, considerably more than that in Avdiivka, and this sector is the second main Russian effort at the moment. Thanks to the arrival of reinforcements, the Ukrainians appear to have slowed Russian advances in a major way after their gains during December. Here the Russians want to take Bohdanivka and Ivanivske, the heights north-west of Klishchiivka and move towards the Donets-Donbas Canal in the direction of Chasiv Yar, a town that is very important strategically as it is the main stronghold for blocking the Russians before Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.\n\nPoint 5) connects to both 3) and 4). The Russians want to dislodge the Ukrainians from the Siversk salient, which threatens both Lysychansk and Soledar. Let's take into account that Siversk was expected to fall as early as July 2022, so it is telling that the Russians have always had setbacks in the area, which then became a secondary front. In the last month, however, attacks have begun towards both Bilohorivka, Spirne and Vesele. There are some Russian successes but I consider it very, very difficult for these tactical gains to turn into a collapse of the salient in its present state. However, the remote possibility of the fall of Siversk would bring the Russians very close to Sloviansk.\n\nFor point 6), the Russians want to develop the main action against the town from the east instead of from the south like in the last year. The attacks towards Novomykhailivka should be read in this context, as well as taking into account the Russian aim to drive the Ukrainians away from the Donetsk-Volnovakha-Melitopol railway. They are moving slowly towards the Kostyantynivka-Vuhledar road in the direction of Vodiane, with the medium-to-long term goal of reaching Vuhledar from the east. There are Russian successes but the Ukrainians seem to be succeeding in stabilizing the situation for now.\n\nAs for the Robotyne salient, they have been attacking there since late November with the goal of taking back some of the Ukrainian gains. There have been Russian successes west and south of Robotyne, between Novoprokopivka and Verbove and around Verbove. The Russians have pushed the Ukrainians away from the dirt road between Novoprokopivka and Verbove the latters had approached during late summer (it passes along the heights between these two villages) as well as from the tactically important Hill 166, which means that the Russians control the heights in the area and don't have to worry about Ukrainian actions directed southwards in the short term, while their regained control of Hill 140 north-west of Verbove secures, in their point of view, that area. However, I doubt they will ever launch an offensive as a main effort in that sector, since they would end up moving away from their current fortifications and it would be a costly operation with no strategic gains.\n\nAs for Krynky, the Russians are heavily invested in the area, but it remains a local action and it's possible that the Ukrainians will withdraw in the coming weeks.\n\nOn a general level, first of all they still have to take Avdiivka, so we are talking about hypothetical plans in their maximalist goals. And it will depend on the situation in terms of ammunition - the attacks of the last few months have been possible also because of the huge amount of shells from North Korea, which is thought to be between 1,5 and 2 millions, despite these shells lacking in quality. It will have to be seen how much Russian production will grow in the future, whether NK will continue to send shells and/or whether they will find other partners, apart from Iran and Belarus, which are supplying shells and rockets, albeit to a more limited extent than NK.",

What happened in Russian politics in 2009 that would mark such a shift? Instead, the divide should undoubtedly be 2011, when the protests shook up the political landscape, showing the government that political demands can come even in spite of - or perhaps because of - overall increase in economic prosperity. So the \"toothless\", unmotivating ideology of economic stewardship above all that is liberal conservatism had to step aside, and there had to arise a certain more ideological conservatism that would give a clearer identity to the government and motivate at least some non-inertial support. That ideology, as the writer notes, was based on appealing to certain generalised beliefs of the Russian people (feelings of believers should not be insulted => \"Pussy riot\" got what was coming; LGBT is bad => they should at least be made unable to propagandise to children, if nothing else; etc). But it's exactly because of that that it didn't contain anything radical (can't upset left-leaning people too much) nor identitarian (can't upset the minorities or the cosmpolitans too much).\n\nSecondly, the author ignores what is by far the strongest feature of Putinism as an ideology to the extent that it exists - its titanic statism. The ideology - especially at its current peak of tenor - expects complete deference to the state, sees the state as inherently good, and state involvement in absolutely every facet of political, social and economic life as desirable if not always achievable. The state should at least tally every single thing, and better yet certify, and better yet control entirely. That, again, flies in the face of some of author's insistence on that ideology being identitarian or populist. Both of these categories imply a population that's riled up, that's engaged in grassroots, bottom-up activity. Putinism is deathly afraid of that sort of thing. That's how you get Strelkov, Prigozhin - or, at least, Poklonskaya, which is also a headache. People shouldn't be energised - they should do what the state tells them to. Initiative is punishable, because it makes the leaders seem like tarrying fools.\n\nThirdly, I don't think the idea that Putinism appeals to common understandings of Russians means that it's populist or set to be enduring. It's easy to imagine the opposite - that it's too nebulous and difficult to set apart against actually consistent, energising ideologies, and is as such doomed without the apparatus of the state or Putin's personal popularity.\n\nFourthly, I'd definitely disagree that Putinism is in continuity with XIXth century Slavophilism in any way. Slavophilism was a liberal ideology that sought a constitution (or even a republic!) and appealed to folk wisdom and traditions. Maybe a Putinist is a liberal when posed against a fan of absolute monarchy, but a Putinist also sees a constitution as a hindrance that one has to pay lip-service to at most, and the public as needing a strong state not to be led astray or accidentally topple the nation. These thoughtpaths are quite contrary to Slavophilism. Plus, is Putin really at home with - let's charitably say Fico and Vucic? Or is he more at home with Asad and Xi? The guy who can't stop quoting the qoran can't be that much of a Slavophile or an identitarian. But that's very consistent with a generic-conservative and statist.",

And if this happens, yes, it will become a very powerful ideology.\n\n\nOddly enough, I agree that traditional culture mixed with (actual) leftist economics would be popular and effective. If someone were to express the cultural and economic reasons for the West's malaise, and combine that with efforts to give power to the poor and middle class, that person would see some interesting and powerful coalitions formed.\n\n\nUnfortunately, no one in any country is articulating either traditional values or leftist economics, in any sense. Traditionalism requires a basis in religion which frankly no one in politics really has, in any country that matters geopolitically. I don't think there's been one since Jimmy Carter, and even his traditionalism wasn't forcefully articulated. Putin's \"traditionalism\" comes down to opposing LGBT and feminism, nothing more. But that's hardly enough to consider it \"traditionalist\".\u00a0\n\n\nAnd to suggest that China is economically leftist is simply incorrect. Independent unions have been banned for forty someodd years, and while striking occasionally occurs, it is not the kind of country-wide shutdowns that won labor its rights in the early 20th century. A person advocating for leftism would be hated by China, as they don't want their economic structure upended any more than outwardly capitalist countries. China is communist in name only. It more closely resembles state-directed capitalism, which is to say, the rich and powerful cut out the middleman of lobbyists to Congress, preferring to run things directly. The evidence here is that I can go into my broker and purchase shares of Chinese companies if I wanted. I'd be stupid to do so, but this is by definition capitalism.\n\n\nI think your main problem here is assuming that Putin has an *ideology* beyond grandiosity. You may as well ask what the ideology of the Czars was. They, and he, wanted power and empire, and a domestic policy focused on achieving that. That's it.",

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been one since Jimmy Carter, and even his traditionalism wasn&#39;t forcefully articulated. Putin&#39;s &quot;traditionalism&quot; comes down to opposing LGBT and feminism, nothing more. But that&#39;s hardly enough to consider it &quot;traditionalist&quot;.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And to suggest that China is economically leftist is simply incorrect. Independent unions have been banned for forty someodd years, and while striking occasionally occurs, it is not the kind of country-wide shutdowns that won labor its rights in the early 20th century. A person advocating for leftism would be hated by China, as they don&#39;t want their economic structure upended any more than outwardly capitalist countries. China is communist in name only. It more closely resembles state-directed capitalism, which is to say, the rich and powerful cut out the middleman of lobbyists to Congress, preferring to run things directly. The evidence here is that I can go into my broker and purchase shares of Chinese companies if I wanted. I&#39;d be stupid to do so, but this is by definition capitalism.</p>\n\n<p>I think your main problem here is assuming that Putin has an <em>ideology</em> beyond grandiosity. You may as well ask what the ideology of the Czars was. They, and he, wanted power and empire, and a domestic policy focused on achieving that. That&#39;s it.</p>\n</div>",

The problem Ukraine is having with ultranationalism (which often manifests in white nationalist/neonazi symbols) is a direct result of a decade of existential pressure from Russia on the country. \n\nDespite the Russians trying to justify their invasion in part as an effort to stamp out Ukrainian \"nazism,\" it doesn't represent a serious threat *yet*. But I think you're right, the longer this war continues, and the worse things get for the Ukrainians, the more people will be radicalized by the conflict. This would be especially problematic in a situation in which Ukraine eventually loses, and blames the West at least in part for not doing more, but even in scenarios in which Ukraine eventually succeeds in driving the Russians entirely from their territory, those extremists may still pose a serious longterm threat to the stability of the Ukrainian state and more broadly across Eastern Europe. \n\nInterestingly enough, Russia is *also* facing similar problems. Their ultranationalists have been empowered by the conflict, and many are receiving training and combat experience from the war serving not only in PMCs like Wagner, or the military proper, but in their own volunteer formations like Rusich and the Russian soccer hooligan unit (can't remember its name right now). On top of that, the Russians have emptied their prisons, dumping violent criminals in Ukraine, giving them combat training and experience, before releasing them in the thousands back into Russia. This is *already* causing problems back home, and it's not hard to imagine that many of these former convicts turned former soldiers will apply their newfound skills back in Russia for petty crime or as muscle for gangs.

The problem Ukraine is having with ultranationalism (which often manifests in white nationalist/neonazi symbols) is a direct result of a decade of existential pressure from Russia on the country. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the Russians trying to justify their invasion in part as an effort to stamp out Ukrainian &quot;nazism,&quot; it doesn&#39;t represent a serious threat <em>yet</em>. But I think you&#39;re right, the longer this war continues, and the worse things get for the Ukrainians, the more people will be radicalized by the conflict. This would be especially problematic in a situation in which Ukraine eventually loses, and blames the West at least in part for not doing more, but even in scenarios in which Ukraine eventually succeeds in driving the Russians entirely from their territory, those extremists may still pose a serious longterm threat to the stability of the Ukrainian state and more broadly across Eastern Europe. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, Russia is <em>also</em> facing similar problems. Their ultranationalists have been empowered by the conflict, and many are receiving training and combat experience from the war serving not only in PMCs like Wagner, or the military proper, but in their own volunteer formations like Rusich and the Russian soccer hooligan unit (can&#39;t remember its name right now). On top of that, the Russians have emptied their prisons, dumping violent criminals in Ukraine, giving them combat training and experience, before releasing them in the thousands back into Russia. This is <em>already</em> causing problems back home, and it&#39;s not hard to imagine that many of these former convicts turned former soldiers will apply their newfound skills back in Russia for petty crime or as muscle for gangs. That many (most) of these guys will have untreated PTSD and TBIs only makes it that much more dangerous in the long run. </p>\n\n<p>Yet more casualties of this ill-planned, poorly implemented and pointless war.</p>\n</div>",
