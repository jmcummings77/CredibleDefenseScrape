      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Meanwhile people are talking about it as if this is world war 3.\n\n\nAre people ignoring the fact that both Israel \u00e1nd Iran have reasons to really hype this attack? Israel wants to be a victim. Iran wants to be a regional player.\n\n\nHezbollah is.. nothing. Israel is trying so hard to pretend that this time it's a real threat. Like Hezbollah has been lying low all this time but now, 6 months after the start of the Gaza war, they're *really* angry. \n\n\nIt's bullshit and I don't understand how so much of international media is going along with this.

In addition they have ironed out some of their early war issues.\n\nI don't think that this is an accurate assessment - Russia hasn't scaled their production significantly and it continues to be at a rather slow pace, certainly well below the combat losses. What they are doing is pulling equipment out of their storage areas and restoring it to operable level, which is significantly less costly than building equipment from scratch. The problem for Russia is that their reserves in deep storage are a finite resource, which will be nearly impossible to replace (their vast reserves were literally built over decades by the Soviet Union which had much higher production capacity) and they are burning through their reserves at breathtaking pace. There are multiple analyses of satellite photos of Russian storage areas that clearly demonstrate that they have already exhausted significant amount of their stock. Satellite photos aside, we're seeing the evidence on the frontline on a daily basis. MT-LBs, BTR-50s, BTR-60s, T-55s, T-62s have no place doing assaults on the modern battlefield. Yet they have resorted to using them in such role on a regular basis, because their better gear is simply insufficient. And lately we're seeing increasing use of the Chinese Golf Carts and old Soviet \u0431\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 doing assaults, which is nothing short of caricature. How the mighty have fallen.\n\nAll of the above leads me to believe that we're seeing the last dying thrashes of an animal that realizes its time is numbered. They've managed to use their influence to delay the US and EU aid (even if the EU aid package recently passed it took a lot of time to get it through) and they know that's their last chance to pull it off so they're throwing their last remaining resources in one last gambit.\n\nIf you want to see production mobilization you should not look at Russia, you should look at what Europe is doing which is finally starting to show results. Take for example France - they recently announced that they will achieve higher than expected rate of production of their CAESAR self-propelled artillery and they'll be building 12 units per month which means around 140 per year. Can Russia produce 140 state of the art SPHs per year? And that's just France. Europe's artillery shell production is also expected to exceed Russia's production this year.\n\nUnfortunately this doesn't mean that Ukraine's success is guaranteed. I believe that time is on their side and if they manage to hold on for a few more years, the momentum in the EU alone will significantly tip the scale in their favor. But holding on is incredibly costly and there's no guarantee they'll be able to do it.",

But if not, then let me just repeat myself.\n\nThe first part of the option Israel has chosen not to take involves relying less on area clearing bombs, and more house to house clearing on foot. Naturally, this involves taking more casualties, because when you actually face your enemies on the ground people tend to die. What this also means however is that fewer innocent people die, because instead of simply levelling entire areas which include innocents, there is some effort to distinguish. And beyond peoples' lives directly, this means people actually have something to come back to when the fighting is over, because entire city blocks have not been levelled. You could sum up this half as just saying Israel needs to put \"skin in the game\", if they want any sympathy. Bombing the hell out of a packed city is cruel even when it can at least be evacuated, but doing so when your stated goal is rescuing hostages is just absurd.\n\nThe second part of the option Israel has not chosen is providing for the civilian population who has come under their control. Denying food to hundreds of thousands of people is just plain evil, I don't really know what else to say here. If they simply starved everyone in Gaza I suppose that is certainly one way to kill off Hamas, but again, not every weapon of war is equally legitimate in most people's minds.\n\nTo sum up, Israel has chosen to wage war more mercilessly and with less regard for civilians than many people think is okay. The other option is to prosecute the war just as fully to a conclusion, but accept more risk themselves.",
                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>If you will simply refer to what I wrote above, I think it will be abundantly clear. But if not, then let me just repeat myself.</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the option Israel has chosen not to take involves relying less on area clearing bombs, and more house to house clearing on foot. Naturally, this involves taking more casualties, because when you actually face your enemies on the ground people tend to die. What this also means however is that fewer innocent people die, because instead of simply levelling entire areas which include innocents, there is some effort to distinguish. And beyond peoples&#39; lives directly, this means people actually have something to come back to when the fighting is over, because entire city blocks have not been levelled. You could sum up this half as just saying Israel needs to put &quot;skin in the game&quot;, if they want any sympathy. Bombing the hell out of a packed city is cruel even when it can at least be evacuated, but doing so when your stated goal is rescuing hostages is just absurd.</p>\n\n<p>The second part of the option Israel has not chosen is providing for the civilian population who has come under their control. Denying food to hundreds of thousands of people is just plain evil, I don&#39;t really know what else to say here. If they simply starved everyone in Gaza I suppose that is certainly one way to kill off Hamas, but again, not every weapon of war is equally legitimate in most people&#39;s minds.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, Israel has chosen to wage war more mercilessly and with less regard for civilians than many people think is okay. The other option is to prosecute the war just as fully to a conclusion, but accept more risk themselves.</p>\n</div>",
