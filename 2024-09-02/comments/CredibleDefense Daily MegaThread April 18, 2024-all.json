As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

                                    "body": "Its not as rosy as you make it seem though. Iran gets nukes, and the rest of the region very likely nuclearizes as well. Moreover, their Al Quds operations would basically have to stop, I cant see a world in which Israel or the US tolerates the possibility of Hamas, the Houthis, or Hezbollah getting nukes off Iran. Which might actually lead to *more* attacks against Iran and a further deterioration of the situation. Plus theyre basically accepting permanent North Korea status, with sanctions basically never really coming off. Iran has been close to a nuke for years, but theyre also on the cusp of a real normalization of relations with their #1 ideal trading partners, Europe. Basically were talking about making a choice that you'd rather have the former than the latter.\n\nAnd so the calculus is, whats more important securing yourself from the US and Israel or making shit loads of cash off oil sales (also remember, were at peak oil now waiting only diminishes revenues in the future)? The problem, for the hawks, is that Israel cannot pose an existential threat to Iran sans their own nuclear weapons, and the US *probably* isn't either. It could become one, and so there is some real danger, but it *probably* wont be because the kind of operation required to really knock out the current regime would require a manpower commitment the US really is not interested in. So there isn't a massive threat that must be addressed today, rather the threat is emotional and ideological. But there is a *major* downside to passing up on oil revenues today. Because tomorrow less oil will be burnt, and so on. If you got into a zero export state (and keep in mind that Irans other two major trading partners, India and China, are now reliant on bottom dollar Russian desperation oil) youre mortgaging your future for security now because those revenues could have been rolled over into the domestic economy. Saudi Arabia is the alternative vision here, and is building a demi-empire out in the Gulf based primarily on their current oil revenues. With the goal of turning KSA into something other than a petrolstate when global energy needs change. If youre Iran, do you wanna keep up with that game, or do you wanna chase the Korean dragon? The other wrinkle is that in many ways Iran's nuclear program is more valuable as a problem than a reality, in that it forces states to engage with them and try and buy off their good graces. Like basically the threat of nuclear testing is probably going to be enough to limit any further retaliation against them in this crisis. Its not a bad card to keep in your pocket, but once you play it, youll never get that card back. See, again, North Korea.

                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Its not as rosy as you make it seem though. Iran gets nukes, and the rest of the region very likely nuclearizes as well. Moreover, their Al Quds operations would basically have to stop, I cant see a world in which Israel or the US tolerates the possibility of Hamas, the Houthis, or Hezbollah getting nukes off Iran. Which might actually lead to <em>more</em> attacks against Iran and a further deterioration of the situation. Plus theyre basically accepting permanent North Korea status, with sanctions basically never really coming off. Iran has been close to a nuke for years, but theyre also on the cusp of a real normalization of relations with their #1 ideal trading partners, Europe. Basically were talking about making a choice that you&#39;d rather have the former than the latter.</p>\n\n<p>And so the calculus is, whats more important securing yourself from the US and Israel or making shit loads of cash off oil sales (also remember, were at peak oil now waiting only diminishes revenues in the future)? The problem, for the hawks, is that Israel cannot pose an existential threat to Iran sans their own nuclear weapons, and the US <em>probably</em> isn&#39;t either. It could become one, and so there is some real danger, but it <em>probably</em> wont be because the kind of operation required to really knock out the current regime would require a manpower commitment the US really is not interested in. So there isn&#39;t a massive threat that must be addressed today, rather the threat is emotional and ideological. But there is a <em>major</em> downside to passing up on oil revenues today. Because tomorrow less oil will be burnt, and so on. If you got into a zero export state (and keep in mind that Irans other two major trading partners, India and China, are now reliant on bottom dollar Russian desperation oil) youre mortgaging your future for security now because those revenues could have been rolled over into the domestic economy. Saudi Arabia is the alternative vision here, and is building a demi-empire out in the Gulf based primarily on their current oil revenues.

The second article gives out specific information on the production of this radar which involves a lot of delays and the expectation the second one will be produced this year.  \n\n*Ukraine\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) attacked 590th separate radio technical unit of military unit 84680 in Kovylkino, Mordovia, Russia, a source in the HUR told NV on April 17.*\n\n*Two unmanned aerial vehicles attacked Mordovia for the first time, said head of the republic, Artem Zdunov on April 11. According to him, air defense forces allegedly managed to destroy both drones. At the time, Russian Defense Ministry said that three drones were shot down over Kursk and Tambov oblasts, two over Belgorod and Mordovia, and one more over Bryansk and Lipetsk oblasts.*\n\n*Russian media reported that both drones were shot down over military unit 84680 of aerial target detection center in Kovylkino. Attack allegedly damaged building where command center used to be located. Russians did not report any casualities.*\n\n[HUR strikes Russian container 29B6 radar in Mordovia with drone attack | New Voice of Ukraine | April 2024](https://english.nv.ua/nation/hur-unveiled-that-they-striked-kontainer-radar-system-in-mordovia-attack-50410844.html)\n\n[What Makes the 29B6 Container Radar System So Special, Which Has Been Attacked by Ukrainian UAVs for the Second Time? | Defense Express | April 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/what_makes_the_29b6_container_radar_system_so_special_which_has_been_attacked_by_ukrainian_uavs_for_the_second_time-10210.html)\n\n*In the Ukrainian press, there is a report circulating with reference to sources in the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, stating that on April 17th, Ukrainian kamikaze drones attacked a Russian military facility in Mordovia for the second time.*\n\n*There is located a separate radio technical unit of military unit 84680, and it operates an over-the-horizon radar station designated as 29B6 Container, which has a claimed detection range for airborne targets up to 3000 kilometers. Against this backdrop, it may seem paradoxical that Ukrainian UAVs even reach such a target of the Russian invaders, which is designed to detect airborne targets up to 3000 kilometers away. In addition, simultaneously, the Ukrainian Defense Forces are targeting such a military object of the enemy, which is located at a very significant distance from the current front line. Moreover, at the same time, the Ukrainian Defense Forces have targeted such a military object of the enemy, which is located at a very significant distance from the current front line.*\n\n*Let us figure out how many years it took to manufacture and deploy such a radar station on combat duty. The data available indicates that the development and manufacturing of the 29B6 Container took place from 1995 to 2000, with testing and subsequent refinement of this station to the required condition occurring from 2002 to 2012. Moreover, it was only in 2012 that the Russian Ministry of Defense officially announced the commissioning of the 29B6 Container over-the-horizon radar for \"experimental-combat duty,\" with the \"full-scale\" combat duty of this station, according to Russian propagandists, started only in 2019.*\n\n*This is essentially the most powerful radar in the possession of the Russian federation; it currently exists only as a singular instance.*\n\n*As of the same year, 2012, there were announcements about the plans of the Russian Ministry of Defense to deploy a second 29B6 Container station in the Far East with the deadline for combat duty set for 2018. However, in 2020, this deadline was pushed back to 2024.*\n\n*So once again, in the case of the first (and currently only) instance of the 29B6 Container, which has already been targeted twice by our UAVs, the timeline from the start of development to full combat duty has taken almost 15 years. And this is against the backdrop of evident problems with the construction of a second such station.*\n\n*When it comes specifically to the characteristics of the 29B6 Container, the picture becomes even more interesting.*\n\n*First of all, Russian propagandists themselves, in one of the publications dating back to 2020, acknowledged that this station has a \"dead zone\" of surveillance of approximately 900 kilometers, which is why they allegedly relocated it deep into Russian territory, all the way to Mordovia.*\n\n*If this figure of a \"dead zone\" of 900 kilometers is accurate, it may suggest how the Russians could have \"missed\" the flight of our drones to strike the Container.*\n\n*The 29B6 Container is capable of conducting continuous monitoring of the airspace of Ukraine in the interests of the Russian army. Therefore, striking and disabling this enemy object is important precisely to improve the defense of Ukrainian airspace.*",

He didn\u2019t say which allies. Germany is already sending one system.\n\nI have my doubts about this. There aren\u2019t even that many Patriot systems in Europe.

I can make a selfish decision and do something that\u2019s different but I\u2019m doing here what I believe to be the right thing.\n\n\n>\u201cI think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important. I really do. I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we\u2019ve gotten. I believe Xi, Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. I think they\u2019re in coordination on it.\n\n\n>\u201cSo I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Balkans next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies.\n\n\n>\u201cTo put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families.

I can make a selfish decision and do something that\u2019s different but I\u2019m doing here what I believe to be the right thing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important. I really do. I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we\u2019ve gotten. I believe Xi, Vladimir Putin and Iran really are an axis of evil. I think they\u2019re in coordination on it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Balkans next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTo put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families.

By supporting safer and more effective disease detection, this\n> assistance directly improved Ukraine\u2019s COVID-19 response. BTRP partners with the\n> World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, the U.S. Centers\n> for Disease Control and Prevention and other health institutions in providing this\n> assistance.\n\nWhile I'm sure that the great majority of work at these facilities is above-board, it is a fact that biodefense research is inherently a double-edged sword. The exact same technologies and facilities that produce vaccines for deadly diseases can also produce the diseases themself. Look no further than the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its Coronavirus lab for a modern example.\n\nIn the context of the Ukrainian conflict, with the rapid decline in arms shipments and an overall bleak picture for further Ukrainian success, there is a degree of uncertainty in the continued safety of these facilities.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Partisan politics aside, the whole &quot;Ukrainian biolabs&quot; narrative really needs to be analyzed objectively, because there is some truth to it. <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/11/2002954612/-1/-1/0/FACT-SHEET-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE%27S-COOPERATIVE-THREAT-REDUCTION-PROGRAM-BIOLOGICAL-THREAT-REDUCTION-PROGRAM-ACTIVITIES-IN-UKRAINE.PDF\">Here is an official DoD press release</a> from March 2022 titled &quot;<strong>The Department of Defense\u2019s Cooperative Threat\nReduction Program - Biological Threat Reduction\nProgram Activities in Ukraine</strong>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>which provides the following details, among others:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Facts</strong></p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>The United States, through BTRP, has invested approximately $200 million in Ukraine\nsince 2005, supporting 46 Ukrainian laboratories, health facilities, and diagnostic sites.\nBTRP has improved Ukraine\u2019s biological safety, security and surveillance for both\nhuman and animal health. By supporting safer and more effective disease detection, this\nassistance directly improved Ukraine\u2019s COVID-19 response. BTRP partners with the\nWorld Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, the U.S. Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention and other health institutions in providing this\nassistance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While I&#39;m sure that the great majority of work at these facilities is above-board, it is a fact that biodefense research is inherently a double-edged sword. The exact same technologies and facilities that produce vaccines for deadly diseases can also produce the diseases themself. Look no further than the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its Coronavirus lab for a modern example.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of the Ukrainian conflict, with the rapid decline in arms shipments and an overall bleak picture for further Ukrainian success, there is a degree of uncertainty in the continued safety of these facilities. This is not a partisan issue - all sides benefit equally from safe biofacilities - but unfortunately it has been framed as one by politicians and the media. Hopefully these can attitudes will began to change and the public and decisionmakers can reach an informed decision about biological research, especially that which may be taking place in active warzone.</p>\n</div>",

These programs have only tenuous and entirely semantic relations with what you are implying. In no way does \"biodefense research\" in this context have even marginal amounts to do with biological weapons development, or would it really enable that in any way. \n\nIt is sorta like if the US provided money for upgrading plumbing overseas, called it \"joint sanitation development\", and then some crackhead concluded that sanitization is also a euphemism you could use to describe ethnic cleansing. That is the level of discourse this represents, and honestly I think even bringing it up is dangerous because it is so stupid that talking about it gives it oxygen, and runs the risk of people believing it because \"where there's smoke there's fire.\" In fact, sometimes where there is smoke there are actually well funded psyops campaigns run by the Russian government. But going so far as to say \"because there is some truth to it\" is bad faith and asinine.\n\nBut lets get further into the actual facts here, beginning with the numbers. $200,000,000 is a pitiful amount of money in the context of biological research programs, that is roughly what might be spent on an American highschool building. Laboratory equipment, even in poorer countries is extremely expensive, because it is low volume and requires extreme precision, high end technology, and low competition. Needless to say, this money even if it were going to illicit purposes, would not be going terribly far.\n\nBut then lets look at what the program actually entails. BTRP includes:\n\n-Investments to upgrade biosafety levels in state health labs. This is still a very low level of biosafety, meaning giving Ukrainians gloves, labcoats, and some basic aseptic stuff, not like prion level bio safety. This is converting a complete lack of laboratory safety and isolation into ok levels of safety.\n\n-Providing grants to scientists to encourage paper publication. Notably these are public papers and public grants.\n\n-A review of current Ukrainian efforts to detect pandemics early.\n\n-Funding for public scientific conferences.\n\n-Funding to integrate Ukrainian disease detection efforts into Central Asian countries efforts.\n\nAll of these programs sum up to pretty much increasing Ukraine's ability to detect outbreaks of diseases early on and to prevent pandemics, and would have exactly zero \"dual-use\" capability in the bioweapons context. The only one even marginally close is the BSL-2 upgrade, because that is physical supplies, and again, this is like stuff at the level of providing lab gloves to people who would otherwise be working gloveless. It is not the sort of thing you can make bioweapons with unless you expect your evil scientists to be okay with dying off in droves. \n\nSo pretty much all of this talk is horseshit, but moreover it is extremely dangerous horseshit because it both plays into Russian talking points and it has the tendency to reduce funding for good programs that greatly reduce human suffering. Spreading this nonsense so credulously in all honesty has the direct effect of causing the deaths of the young and the old, the primary sufferers of infectuous disease. It is heartless.",

For a start Ukraine need to have the tubes and pieces to actually use that stockpile and artillery wear has been a major challenge since 2022 which continues to go unaddressed. Not to mention Ukraine has a relatively limited number of artillery platforms compared to Russia. More SPG's are on the way from Western orders but they're yet to arrive in volume. Having a million shells also doesn't really matter if the evolved battlefield in which your artillery needs to operate in high volume (and with high detectability) is filled with increasing numbers of loitering munitions and a resurgent Russian long range counterbattery fires threat. \n\nI'm not saying it won't have an impact or that it will be entirely negated, it won't, the modern battlefield is complicated and there's no single silver bullet. More shells is better than no shells and Ukraine will be in a better position once this delivery occurs. That being said your comment here is just laughable. Artillery ammunition is not the be all and end all of warfare, if it were Ukraine wouldn't exist right now, they've been huffing fumes for months and have throughout the entire war been greatly outnumbered by Russian artillery both in volume of fire and total number of pieces. \n\nOn the point of ethnic minorities, Russia is a varied country and recruitment by financial incentive tends to favour those who more desperately need the money and ethnic minorities tend to live further east in the country where economic development is much lower. Shocker. This has been the truth and case of military forces for centuries, particularly those engaged in full scale warfare where exclusively professional and career soldiers rapidly get outnumbered by fresh recruits and conscripts. Do we really want to open this can of worms when it comes to disproportionate ethnic minorities predicated on wealth in our own armed forces? Puerto Rico would like to know your location. This isn't a knock against ethnic minorities, far from it, anyone that is willing to serve deserves respect and your downplaying of the situation by throwing in ethnic minorities as if it's remotely relevant to Russia out-recruiting Ukraine is just silly. Even if you're inferring negative connotations, it's irrelevant, they're still out-recruiting Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian threat is real regardless of how people describe or minimize it and has been real for 2 years now. Losses are high, equipment losses are high and yet Russia is in a better position today than it was 2 years ago, with a large number of active vehicles, vastly larger reserves and mobilized troops as well as ramped up production. Ontop of all this they've got an extremely healthy inflow of recruits, rapidly outpacing Ukraine to the degree that even after half-neutered mobilization reform they are unlikely to achieve parity with Russia. This differential will continue to get wider and allows Russia to trade at unfavourable ratios that typically wouldn't be beneficial, yet still in this case on a strategic level they are disproportionately damaging and *unsustainable* for Ukraine. \n\nYou're parroting often repeated talking points about Cannon Fodder, Ethnic Minorities and Russian troops being unable to engage in offensive operations.
