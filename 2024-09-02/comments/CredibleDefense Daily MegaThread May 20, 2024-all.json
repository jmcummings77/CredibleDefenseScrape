                "body": "Ruslan Mykula (one of the founders of DeepState) last week warned to watch carefully Kozacha Lapan (Kharkiv Oblast, but to the west of the Kharkiv River), and Bilopillia (Sumy Oblast, north-west of the regional capital); while for the observer Mashovets two potential directions could be Sudzha --> Sumy or Grayvoron --> Velyka Pysarivka (Sumy Oblast). In any case, I can confirm Andrew Perpetua's assessments reported by OP. Near Sudzha, during the end of the last week, elements of the 103rd TDF Brigade destroyed two Russian tanks with FPV drones, several kilometers inside the Russian border. Let's say there is more movement and activity by the Russians (more shelling, more actions by DRG groups), but I think the main purpose at the moment may be to force the Ukrainians to keep the state border manned, in order to prevent reinforcements being sent in the directions of the current offensive. Interesting to point out that Mykula stated that the \u201cLyut\u201d Brigade of the National Police (or at least some of its assault regiments/battalions, since the \u201cLuhansk-1\u201d Regiment and the brigade's artillery group are currently active near Chasiv Yar), which acted mostly as a reserve, is being transferred to Kharkiv, and its servicemen learnt about the ongoing transfer from a TASS (!) article, only to later find out it was true. Moreover, the 2nd Battalion of the 36th Marine Brigade, which is where the famous UAV operator Kriegsforscher serves, recently arrived in Vovchansk.\n\nThat said, I can confirm the numbers you wrote, that's the extent of the manpower of the Russians covering the border in Bryansk and Kursk Oblasts (Mashovets this morning wrote that in the Kursk Oblast there are about 10k Russian soldiers), and I don't see the strength needed by the Russians in order to commit to anything serious there - we knew that the bulk of the 11th Corps was deployed in Belgorod Oblast and that the first elements of the 44th Corps were deployed there as soon as they arrived in early May, but there are no similar formations in the other two oblasts that we know of right now (to answer to your other question: if you take away the formations being created as part of the strategic-operational reserve, Russia has no divisions/brigades that are entirely resting in Russia, nor in Belarus). \n\nThat could change in the future if the rest of the 44th Corps is sent to the border with the Sumy Oblast as soon as it's ready. Such as its 128th Motorized Brigade, which should be entirely deployed by the end of this month according to Russian sources - and Mashovets this morning wrote that elements of this brigade may have just arrived around Grayvoron. Or such as the rest of the 72nd Motorized Division: we know that its 41st Motorized Regiment is being heavily engaged near Vovchansk, but its 30th Motorized Regiment is still a reserve in the rear, and I guess the third motorized regiment should arrive in the future too. But sending these new units to Sudzha, Grayvoron etc. also means taking away potential reinforcements from the directions of Lyptsi and Vovchansk, at least if Russia doesn't transfer units or formations from other areas... Mashovets also stressed this several times: Russia currently has the capabilities to either aim to expand the front in the North (attacking in other directions) OR to reinforce the current two directions near Kharkiv in order to move on to the next phases of the offensive, but not for both (without \"stealing\" units from the rest of the GoFs, at least).\n\nFor the time being, we know that companies of the 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA (along with some regiments of the Territorial Forces attached to the 6th CAA) are arriving in Vovchansk to support the 138th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA, which has brought an additional battalion into action (it had one committed, previously), and that elements of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st GTA (perhaps belonging both to its 1st Tank Regiment and to its 1st Motorized Regiment) have arrived near Vovchansk, where the 153rd Tank Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA is deployed too. But receiving additional reinforcements from the 1st GTA also means less pressure capabilities in the Kupyansk and Svatove sectors. Moreover, in the last week POWs from units of the 20th CAA, of the 90th Tank Division, of the 7th Military Base and from units of the 8th CAA have been captured in Vovchansk. I tend to categorically rule out that units of these formations were redeployed there, probably they are from battalions of brigades/regiments of these formations that were in R&R covering the state border and found themselves taking part in the actions, or perhaps transfers of stormtroopers took place in order to reinforce the units of the GoF \"North,\" or again they were not actually captured in Kharkiv Oblast but elsewhere...",

        "body": "On May 18, Ukraine's new mobilization law officially went into effect. Among the changes, all men between 18 and 59 will have to update their own informations (before July 18) either physically at the Territorial Recruitment Center (or in an administrative service center), or online, via the new \"Reserv+\" app. As of today, 415 thousand Ukrainians [have registered](https://censor.net/en/news/3490331/skilky_gromadyan_onovyly_dani_u_rezerv) their information through this app, and long lines are reported in front of TRCs. Obviously, updating one's information doesn't mean being immediately mobilized, but it does mean giving one's readiness for an examination at the military medical commission and being mobilized in case one receives a subpoena in the future. \n\nIn addition, fines for those who ignore summons [have been increased](https://censor.net/en/news/3489973/fines_for_evading_mobilisation_zelenskyy_signs_law) and TRCs have gained the ability to give fines in absentia, but overall there are no draconian measures in this regard, other than the possibility of having one's driver's license revoked. As I understand it, not showing up at the military medical examination will not be a crime, unlike what was announced.\n\nThere will be better cooperation between TRCs and police. In the first four months of 2024, in the oblasts that released data, the TRCs [asked](https://censor.net/en/news/3490307/natspolitsiya_rozshukuye_945_tysyach_uhylyantiv_statystyka_po_oblastyah) the Police to bring 94,500 men who had ignored subpoenas ahead of them, and the Police have accompanied more than 20,000 so far. \n\nSeveral categories [have lost](https://censor.net/ua/news/3490079/zakon_pro_mobilizatsiyu_nabrav_chynnosti) their exemption from mobilization: fathers of three or more children who have been in arrears in child support payments for more than three months; men who are raising a child under the age of 18 on their own and the child's mother hasn't lost parental authority, is not deceased, etc;\nstudents who are receiving an education inconsistent with their current level (such as a MSc graduate studying for a bachelor); part-time teachers; men whose wives have a disability of the third group (the less serious one). For some reason, according to a decree of the Ministry of Economy, employees of Glovo, VISA and Favbet Tech (a betting agency) [had earned](https://censor.net/ua/news/3489788/svyrydenko_skasovuye_nakaz_pro_bronyuvannya_tehnologichnyh_kompaniyi) deferment from mobilization for 6 months, but after public backlash this was withdrawn.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that throughout Ukraine, Recruitment Centers run directly by the UAF (without involvement of the TRCs) are opening. After the openings in Transcarpathia earlier this month (in Mukachevo and in Uzhhorod) and an additional center in Kyiv, there are now 21 of them, and by the end of June there will be 27. These centers were created to bypass the TRCs, which scare a lot of people (quite a few stories of people who wanted to volunteer and had a letter of recommendation from the brigade they chose, and the TRC would have sent them somewhere else if representatives of the brigade had not intervened). Ukrainian citizens can visit these centers without formal commitment, talk to the secretaries who will list which vacancies there are, in which brigades, and in which sector. And if the interested person finds something that interests him, he can sign a contract with the unit he chose. In addition, the system works that for example an inhabitant of Zaporizhzhia will have the priority over the vacancies in brigades fighting in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, so that he has a chance to fight close to home and in defense of his region. These centers have a certain turnout, the problem (I have written about this several times in the past), is that [according](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/05/12/7455441/) to the Minister of Defense Umerov himself, the jobs most in demand are driver, mechanic and drone pilot... when the most needed role is that of infantryman. \n\nAs for inmates, according to reports from the Minister of Justice, 4,500 of them had, as of April, [given their willingness](https://censor.net/en/news/3489891/mobilization_of_convicts_in_ukraine) to join the UAF as volunteers. Around 4,000 convicts were excluded from the possibility of joining because they are infected with HIV, hepatitis or tuberculosis. Unlike what initially seemed, those convicted of drug offenses will have the opportunity to volunteer. This will also help reduce overcrowding in pre-trial detention centers. \n\n***\n\nMilitaryLand [has discovered](https://militaryland.net/news/the-army-forms-additional-infantry-brigades/) that five new brigades have just been created in the Ground Forces: the 155th, 156th, 157th, 158th and 159th Infantry Brigades. Infantry brigades are a fairly new format in the UAF. There are currently the 141st, 142nd, 143rd and 144th Infantry Brigades that were created about a year ago, and the 153rd Infantry Brigade which is in training stage, and was reformed a few months ago from mechanized to infantry due to the equipment shortage. (Lack of) Vehicles are not the only difference with mechanized brigades. Infantry brigades are basically TDF brigades but within the Ground Forces, and not composed very largely of volunteers as in the TDF.\n\nIn practice, during 2022, Ukraine created a lot of rifle battalions: either line ones, organically part of existing brigades, or separate ones, which could be attached to a brigade if necessary: these are the separate rifle battalions from 1st to 70th, some of which were later disbanded or used as the basis for the creation of the brigades raised in late 2022 / early 2023. During 2023, Ukraine formed dozens and dozens more separate rifle battalions: those of the 4xx-th series (usually created on a regional basis). Those from 401st to 426th are usually attached to brigades of the Ground Forces and function like those created during 2022. Other separate rifle battalions were then created, in this case subordinate to the four infantry brigades created in mid-2023. Each of these has six rifle battalions: 141st (451st to 456th), 142nd (457th to 462nd), 143rd (463rd to 468th) and 144th (469th to 474th). \n\nDepending on whether the new brigades have 5 or 6 battalions each, we are talking about 25 to 30 new rifle battalions being created. However, it must be said that this type of unit has certain critical issues. First, lack of armored vehicles (except for a few APCs/IMVs), no tanks, and no own artillery group - usually infantry brigades work with the support from artillery brigades or from the artillery group of other brigades, while obviously having mortars in each battalion. In addition, these brigades are usually employed through their battalions getting subordinated to other brigades, instead of holding a section of the front independently, which suggests that they have a scarce HQ staff. The only partial exception is the 141st Infantry Brigade, which should be fully deployed in the Orikhiv sector (particularly near Robotyne), produces videos from there, official brigade's sources state they are defending the front in that sector etc. The other brigades have battalions in multiple sectors attached to various brigades to strengthen their infantry endowment. Most of the battalions of the 142nd Infantry Brigade are in the Avdiivka sector, attached to the various brigades that are there, others in the Marinka sector; the 143rd and 144th Infantry Brigades have battalions in Avdiivka, others in Bakhmut, others in Kreminna, others in Kupyansk, others along the state border. And they are separate battalions anyway, which means there are more junior officers in support functions than in a line mechanized battalion!\n\nMoreover, as far as I know, rifle battalions are largely made up of the oldest mobilized men, with the vast majority of their servicemen being over 45 years old. In the case of the 143rd Infantry Brigade, I read today in the comments on a Ukrainian Telegram channel that 75% of the personnel are over 45; the brigade had finished training in October 2023, and its battalions were partly used to restore the combat capabilities of the brigades employed in Avdiivka during the battle for the city, leaving the brigade understaffed for several months. I have written several times that there is an active discrimination in Ukraine between older mobilized men being sent to these units (that mostly end up getting attached to other units to act as replacements), while mobilized men which are under 35 are sent primarily to brigades of the Air Assault Forces (which makes sense, mind you). DeepState recently criticized the existence itself of the 4xx-th series rifle battalions, writing that one of them abandoned its positions near Strilecha in Kharkiv (as far as I have investigated, it should be the 415th), causing problems that the soldiers of the 125th TDF Brigade had to try to solve.",

It looks like some leaders have in mind the idea that Russia can't be allowed to win that war, and they are trying to prevent that from happening. Okay, but then what's the plan? Send NATO troops for what precisely? \n\nI think that is precisely the debate we are witnessing play out in the broader European policy space right now. There isn't a clearly articulated strategy in part because the debate around that strategy is still ongoing, with various leaders pushing across distinct national, European, and NATO political contexts for various levels and categories of commitment. That said, I think we can nevertheless infer some of the intent, objectives, and limitations of these proposals.\n\nThe absence of strong central leadership, or even a clear organizational center of gravity at the alliance level, certainly obfuscates some of that information. The Biden admin has attempted to take a backseat role in coordinating Ukraine aid, both as a hedge against a second Trump presidency and conflicts with China, North Korea, or Iran. No clear leader means there is no clearly articulated strategy, just a hodgepodge of politically acceptable compromises. Which is often the case with military alliances. Unity of command typically can help limit the negative effects of suboptimal policy by shaping the disparate elements of the war effort to conform to a holistic vision and theory of victory. However, NATO without the US means there is no unity of command, because every major decision requires universal consent and no one alliance member has the effective power to dictate results, leading to the endless public bickering and the attendant lack of clarity you describe.\n\nIt's revealing to compare the current discussions to the main battle tank debates in late 2022 and early 2023. The Biden admin made it clear that they would not donate because the logistical pipeline required to support Abrams is extremely expensive and exclusively American, and thus vulnerable to cuts by Congress or a potential future Trump admin. This debate was probably the first time that the Biden administration explicitly pushed for \"Europeanization\" of Ukrainian aid, likely because it was around that time that serious election polling first showed Trump had a substantial chance at the Republican nomination for president.\n\nThe UK briefly attempted to substitute for the US as leading nation in the alliance, becoming the first nation to donate main battle tanks with 20 Challenger 2s, which it does not have in sufficient quantity to meet Ukraine's needs, so the hope was always that others would follow suit. Leopard 2 donations always made the most sense, because they are the most commonly available modern MBT available from a broad array of Ukraine-allied countries rather than just one potentially unreliable source, such as the US is with M1A1s. Yet donations were not forthcoming, largely because Germany held back, and its permission was needed for other NATO nations to re-export Leos to Ukraine. Under pressure to donate, Otto Shulz then insisted on the \"lockstep principle,\" under which members of the alliance would donate escalatory capabilities in lockstep with each other, to avoid Russia singling any one partner out for retaliation. Leo 2 donations were thus predicated on the US donating MBTs, which eventually provided a token 30 Abrams.\n\nObviously, lockstep is not compatible with Europeanization. Rather than provide leadership within NATO and the broader Ukrainian alliance to coordinate the MBT donations quickly and with appropriate logistical pipelines in place to support a long term war effort, Schulz expended his political capital on forcing the US to participate in the MBT donations, wasting the limited US funds available which could otherwise have been allocated to higher value systems like additional GMLRS or ATACMS ammunition.\n\nSo basically, you have a situation where the only two countries with the practical ability to take a leading role in the alliance are fighting to pass responsibility off between them. Which I would argue is inexcusable irresponsibility from the Germans, given how much stronger their interest in European security is than the corresponding US interest, and given the inherently one-sided nature of NATO (i.e., the US's major geopolitical threat is China, in the western Pacific where NATO Article 5 does not apply, whereas it does apply to Europe's greatest geopolitical threat, Russia). The UK is the one country clearly willing to exercise leadership, but lacks the resources to dictate specific results unilaterally (e.g., by just donating all the MBTs necessary on their own, without needing to consult allies) and suffers from a fraught relationship with the EU. France is a bit strange, because despite having the military and economic capacity to take a central role in coordinating aid, their military mostly employs different major equipment types than the rest of NATO. For example, they don't have Leo 2s or F-16s and so could not play a central role in the logistics pipelines to support either of those two most visible of the equipment donation initiatives. Macron has also flipped from doveish to hawkish over the past year or so, but his earlier reticence prevented France from taking a central leadership role, which requires constant and full-throated support for Ukraine. \n\nThus, rather than one larger power acting as the central coordinator for aid, individual leaders of smaller countries are tackling specific issues of interest to them, such as the Czech ammo initiative or the Danish/Dutch F-16 donations, a pattern which is further exacerbating the strangely scattershot set of policy suggestions we are seeing around potentially stationing NATO troops in Ukraine. So far I believe we have heard Macron, the Estonian PM, the British Minister of Defense, and a handful of other politicians floating various suggestions for possible deployments of differing scopes and purposes, and the Germans raising the possible requirement of deploying troops as a justification for not sending Taurus, with the subsequent reactions of various European and NATO officials to that news. So it's no wonder that you are having trouble discerning strategic intent from so many conflicting narratives.\n\nThat said, all the suggestions I have seen suggest replacing Ukrainian troops in rear area positions that can be made essentially completely safe from Russian attack, where NATO personnel might provide logistical support (e.g., prepping specialized kit like Taurus or repairing/maintaining vehicles and equipment), or might help train Ukrainian military personnel. Training troops elsewhere in Europe has proven not economical because of the expense, time, and planning challenges involved in moving thousands of troops in and out of Ukraine and all around Europe. Moving some or all of the European training initiatives in-country could thus help alleviate some of their manpower challenges by increasing the throughput of their training pipeline, while only requiring a small number of NATO personnel deployed in country, ideally to well-secured rear areas.\n\n*Ideally* to well-secured rear areas, which is where the debate seems to have sprawled to include air defense. It will be politically far easier to justify deploying NATO troops to western Ukraine if they are guaranteed to be safe from Russian air strikes. If NATO is securing that airspace itself with ground-based launchers stationed in Poland or Romania, then NATO members don't need to worry about a situation where they donate the same AD resources to Ukraine, which then prioritizes protecting other targets, exposing NATO troops to Russian long range strikes. That policy would also free up Ukrainian AD assets and personnel for securing airspace farther to the east, and would establish a bubble of security from which the Ukrainian air force can operate, which may be particularly desirable to protect the limited numbers of F-16s they will have available over the next few months.\n\nThere have been no serious suggestions that NATO troops be deployed to front line or combat roles, but these types of technical support or military advisory missions are often the escalatory toe in the water that ultimately leads to full combat deployment, such as occurred with the US involvement in Vietnam. That said, I do not see any indications that any of the various leaders suggesting these deployments have any desire to see escalation to full commitment of NATO forces. Rather, the genuine strategic considerations here all seem to relate to maximizing the Ukrainian manpower available for front line combat, precisely to reduce the risk that NATO troop commitments are required to save Ukraine. Specifically, Ukraine's partners seem to be concerned that manpower issues are so acute that they not only prevent a full Ukrainian victory that would force Russia out of the country entirely, but even threaten the Ukrainian Armed Forces' survival. If Ukraine experienced a military collapse now, especially if inadequate aid contributed in anyway, some NATO governments would face enormous political pressure to deploy troops to preserve at least western Ukraine from Russian occupation. Thus, hedging the manpower risks with a limited troop deployment now may prevent the need for a much larger and thus more politically painful deployment sometime in the future.\n\nI do not think any of these proposals would ultimately be escalatory, either. Soviet personnel maintained and even operated air defense against the US in both Korea and Vietnam without escalating to direct conflict. Similarly, I don't think there is any specific nuclear policy required. If the Russians use a tactical nuke in Ukraine, the response is not likely to vary depending on whether a handful of NATO training officers were also killed.",

But you have a big arsed turning circle when bumping along at maybe 500mph so once you release you may have your but hanging out in the danger zone for a bit, this might be where Ukrainian GBAD and the odd aircraft are able to get a bite.</p>\n</div>",

Although the jury is not out on this yet, as if the evacuation zone is really lacking in necessary supplies and facilities, then the humanitarian toll of that lack might become apparent only gradually.\n\n> A smaller force contingent is needed for these attacks because the central Gaza forces were much smaller than the forces remaining in Rafah, but the bottom line was that the IDF could be converging on a point where all 24 Hamas battalions would be dismantled.\n\n> IDF sources suggested that this would signal achieving the first goal of the war, toppling Hamas as a military organization, even if other goals of the war, removal of Hamas as a political authority and return of the hostages, may still remain open questions.\n\nIt is notable if Israel is saying openly that one of the major war goals is close to being accomplished.

Nevermind Russia had a puppet in power until the revolution in 2014; it's going backwards for european/NATO interests but it's not untenable historically.\n\n>And since any conflict with Russia is not likely to be a direct large-scale Fulda Gap style assault, but yet another salami slicing endeavor, these strategic and geopolitical losses matter a hell of a lot more than how many T-64s they have in storage.\n\nTipping points exist, at some point Russia would attack a NATO member or otherwise be dragged into a NATO conflict. They've danced around it e.g. the war in Georgia, and will likely do so after Ukraine, but a NATO member or NATO will put their foot down eventually. Russia can't even annex Ukraine with their pre-war stock, they can't even begin to wage a war against NATO with less.\n\n>If it was a deliberate plan, it's a terrible plan, based on terrible assumptions, and is also being executed poorly.\n\nI don't know why everyone is replying like I said all the leaders sat around a table and agreed to this outcome. I asked if this might be a significant contributing factor to current policy. Consider: The U.S. and/or allies won't allow Ukraine to attack Russia proper with arms provided because that may escalate the war in undesired ways. Simultaneously, now that the war isn't going so well, and Putin is arguably *more* desperate than before, well maybe then Ukraine can attack Russian soil with western supplied arms. That's incongruous, the more desperate Putin becomes the *less* likely he is to use extraordinary means like tactical nukes? I guess you can say we've tested his resolve but I don't find that particularly convincing.\n\n>There are plenty of other reasonable explanations for Western aid failing to meet the level Ukraine would need to maintain full territorial integrity. They're discussed on this sub daily and exhaustively. This just comes off as overly cynical bordering on conspiracy theory.\n\nThat's funny cause I've referenced numerous topics *from /r/credibledefense* in raising this question. The depletion of soviet stockpiles in artillery and tanks by covert cabal I got from /r/credibledefense. The reliance on North Korean supplied shells and missiles with dubious quality, again, /r/credibledefense. The concern over further hostilities leading to increased European aid, arms, or even direct involvement: again this same sub!",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>They went from losing horrifically to NATO in any direct conflict before the war to... losing slightly more horrifically to NATO in any direct conflict, after the war. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why would any nation not seek to weaken a potential adversary?</li>\n<li>If a NATO victory was always so obvious, then why are <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240502-macron-doesn-t-rule-out-troops-for-ukraine-if-russia-breaks-front-lines\">European nations acting so publicly</a> with what can only be described as alarming measures? <a href=\"https://www.airandspaceforces.com/top-nato-commander-big-russia-problem/\">Why are NATO commanders speaking publicly with concern about Russian intentions?</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile any strategy to deliberately withhold aid would be risking real, significant, long-term strategic losses, from Russian annexation of significant portions of Eastern Ukraine, to the potential collapse and occupation of the rest of the country, to increased influence over the rest of their neighbors. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russia has had troops in Ukraine since 2014, the longer they are held up trying to occupy Ukraine the less likely they are to move on to other European states. Nevermind Russia had a puppet in power until the revolution in 2014; it&#39;s going backwards for european/NATO interests but it&#39;s not untenable historically.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And since any conflict with Russia is not likely to be a direct large-scale Fulda Gap style assault, but yet another salami slicing endeavor, these strategic and geopolitical losses matter a hell of a lot more than how many T-64s they have in storage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tipping points exist, at some point Russia would attack a NATO member or otherwise be dragged into a NATO conflict. They&#39;ve danced around it e.g. the war in Georgia, and will likely do so after Ukraine, but a NATO member or NATO will put their foot down eventually. Russia can&#39;t even annex Ukraine with their pre-war stock, they can&#39;t even begin to wage a war against NATO with less.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it was a deliberate plan, it&#39;s a terrible plan, based on terrible assumptions, and is also being executed poorly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know why everyone is replying like I said all the leaders sat around a table and agreed to this outcome. I asked if this might be a significant contributing factor to current policy. Consider: The U.S. and/or allies won&#39;t allow Ukraine to attack Russia proper with arms provided because that may escalate the war in undesired ways. Simultaneously, now that the war isn&#39;t going so well, and Putin is arguably <em>more</em> desperate than before, well maybe then Ukraine can attack Russian soil with western supplied arms. That&#39;s incongruous, the more desperate Putin becomes the <em>less</em> likely he is to use extraordinary means like tactical nukes? I guess you can say we&#39;ve tested his resolve but I don&#39;t find that particularly convincing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are plenty of other reasonable explanations for Western aid failing to meet the level Ukraine would need to maintain full territorial integrity. They&#39;re discussed on this sub daily and exhaustively. This just comes off as overly cynical bordering on conspiracy theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s funny cause I&#39;ve referenced numerous topics <em>from <a href=\"/r/credibledefense\">/r/credibledefense</a></em> in raising this question. The depletion of soviet stockpiles in artillery and tanks by covert cabal I got from <a href=\"/r/credibledefense\">/r/credibledefense</a>. The reliance on North Korean supplied shells and missiles with dubious quality, again, <a href=\"/r/credibledefense\">/r/credibledefense</a>. The concern over further hostilities leading to increased European aid, arms, or even direct involvement: again this same sub!</p>\n</div>",
