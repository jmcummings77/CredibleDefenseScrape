There&#39;s been too much death and destruction now for the Ukrainians to accept a Russian puppet or being forced into the Union state alongside Belarus.</p>\n\n<p>If Putin suceeds to any degree, I would expect the final integration of Belarus to follow soon after, Putin has already forced Lukashenko to complete a lot of the Union State implementation statues that Lukashenko had been dragging his heels on before 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Unless China involves herself, I don&#39;t see any of this happening though. I also don&#39;t see Ukraine routing Russia out of the occupied territories either, so god knows where this is going to end up.</p>\n</div>",

Surrender, or fling bodies? \n\nThe US and lots of other countries have fought higher casualty producing wars than this one and not made negligent manning decisions. \n\n>The more I read about this war, the more it seems obvious that Ukraine is probably barely holding on.\n\nAnd why is that? Why do so many Ukrainians make it a point that they've been at war eight years? Why didn't they prepare for this war? Why didn't they have a plan to actually mobilize their society in case the most obvious thing happened, the war they were already fighting against Russian expanded?\n\n>They can't do a maneuver defense because they probably lack the skilled force needed,\n\nThat's not true, maneuver defense isn't some sort of high speed low drag technique, it just means authorizing retreats BEFORE the defending unit is decisively engaged, ergo fixed in place. The only thing it requires is the political will, which is why it's not allowed. A study of this war shows Ukrainian troops are NOT allowed to surrender territory without permission from Kyiv, \"hold at all cost\" is policy. Part of that is political, part of that is because they're utterly focused on Kill Ratio strategy of attrition, thinking they can make every battle into Mariupol, just like the US thought it could turn every battle in Vietnam into the first part of the battle of Ia Drang. \n\n>they can't generate quality forces because the front is a mulcher demanding bodies so no one gets any training before getting sent out\n\nSituation: Spring Summer of 2022. Most of the theater is quiet except for the Russian offensive in Donbas, which is mostly focused on a salient jutting into Luhansk. Ukraine can just defend the Donbas, but instead they launch a division sized counteroffensive in Kharkiv in late April and a corps sized counteroffensive in the Kherson bridgehead in late May. In the Donbas salient, they focus extensively on defending a salient over the Donets in Severodonetsk instead of retreating across the Donets and holding a much shorter frontage from the heights of Lysychansk, a terrible decision with disastrous repercussions for Luhansk.\n\nThat's a gross violation of the principle of war called economy of force. They're trying to do too much with too little, they're screwing around defensively using costly strategy, and they're launching multiple offensives turning quiet sectors hot to try to liberate territory and act as fixing actions.That was a deliberate choice made at the strategic level, and it's why they were needing so many more bodies, which meant abbreviated training was the only way to make numbers. \n\nAnd if they were worried about losing manpower, that's when to perform maneuver defense, which is part Ukraine doctrine, its to preserve the force, while hurting the enemy, but willingly giving up ground. But they're not doing that, they're fine with minimal training because that's how their senior brass view the value of training. If they cared about it, they'd prioritize it. They don't, so they don't.\n\n>I'm also starting to wonder if the early performance and continuing propaganda that lead the West to think Ukraine can win is starting to become counter productive.\n\nI agree, but it's the Ukrainians mostly responsible for that propaganda. They might win but it's unlikely it'll be from military victories pushing the Russians out.",

Surrender, or fling bodies? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The US and lots of other countries have fought higher casualty producing wars than this one and not made negligent manning decisions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more I read about this war, the more it seems obvious that Ukraine is probably barely holding on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And why is that? Why do so many Ukrainians make it a point that they&#39;ve been at war eight years? Why didn&#39;t they prepare for this war? Why didn&#39;t they have a plan to actually mobilize their society in case the most obvious thing happened, the war they were already fighting against Russian expanded?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They can&#39;t do a maneuver defense because they probably lack the skilled force needed,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not true, maneuver defense isn&#39;t some sort of high speed low drag technique, it just means authorizing retreats BEFORE the defending unit is decisively engaged, ergo fixed in place. The only thing it requires is the political will, which is why it&#39;s not allowed. A study of this war shows Ukrainian troops are NOT allowed to surrender territory without permission from Kyiv, &quot;hold at all cost&quot; is policy.

A 1:1 trade is probably not really worth it, especially if its bleeding ammunition and good manpower. \n\nI dont really think anyone posting here knows what the situation is like in the city now. Is the UA reinforcing the shoulders to keep the way open, or are they pouring men and equipment into a cauldron they may have to evacuate from rapidly? Its hard to tell,",

SVB was very much an outlier in terms of their customer base and portfolio.\n\nAll banks borrow short and lend long.

Startups had a lot of cash in 2019-2022 and had tonnes of investors and high valuations. So they deposited lots of money. SVB then bought Tbills paying 1.75% to hold all this cash. Come to today, VC cash is dry and nobody is investing in growth, so these companies need their money. Problem is, $1000 worth of bonds paying 1.75% degrades as the interest rate goes up.\n\nSo all that money they put \"safe\" in treasuries...well, it's worth a bit less, so they have to sell them at a loss. Do this long enough, and the bank runs out of easily accessible cash and money. Then someone in the know says \"I don't think this bank is steady\" after they've pulled their cash...and it fails as everyone rushes to get their money out. In a bank run, be first.\n\nBut it seems they have around $200B in liabilities against $175B. That's not much of a delta in the grand scheme of things. \n\nAnyways, in this case the FDIC steps in and then sells off the bank basically at auction to interested parties. But they didn't fail because they were making bad loans or anything, it was just an old fashioned bankrun. If I was a cash-rich Canadian bank I'd be looking at buying it 100%. Pretty rare opportunity to buy in a normally red-hot sector at a discount. \n\nIf it's not sold by Monday, well, then there are going to be *serious* fireworks. I'd say 99.9999% sure this thing is owned by JPM or the equivalent by the time the bell rings tomorrow. It might even sell at a premium, but I think it'll sell. If it doesn't, well, then the banking sector might well implode. Low chance, but a chance.",
