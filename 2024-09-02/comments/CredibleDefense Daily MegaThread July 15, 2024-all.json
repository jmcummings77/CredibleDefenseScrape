Admittedly I don't pay much attention to US domestic politics, but I was surprised that he articulated his (populist) positions with a minimum of bullshit. He seems pretty well-spoken. Whether you agree with his positions is a different story, of course.\n\nOf particular interest to this audience is probably his comments on Ukraine. \n\n> *Ukraine.*\n\n> Yeah.\n\n> *In the opinion piece you wrote for us, you were very critical of the aid that we were giving to Ukraine. But at the end of the piece, you seemed open to the idea of supporting Ukraine in a defensive posture.\nFrom a certain perspective, that is what the Biden administration has done. Yes, they supported two Ukrainian counteroffensives, one of which went well and one of which did not. But relative to more hawkish voices, including in your own party, they have tried to avoid direct confrontation with Russia. So I\u2019m curious what you think has been so wrong with their strategy. I know you think we shouldn\u2019t have encouraged the recent counteroffensive\u2014\u2014*\n\n> That\u2019s the most important divergence between me and the Biden administration. I thought the counteroffensive would be a disaster, that we were motivated by moralism and not enough by strategic thinking. The Russians had really adjusted in a lot of profound ways. It was extremely obvious, when you talked to our military leadership in classified settings, they were exceedingly skeptical that the Ukrainians would achieve any strategic breakthrough. OK, why are we doing this then?\n\n> *Is there a more minimalist J.D. Vance plan that would involve limited defensive support for Ukraine as part of a path to armistice?*\n\n> What I would like to do, and what I think fundamentally is achievable here with American leadership \u2014 but you never know till you have the conversation \u2014 is you freeze the territorial lines somewhere close to where they are right now. That\u2019s No. 1. No. 2 is you guarantee both Kyiv\u2019s independence but also its neutrality. It\u2019s the fundamental thing the Russians have asked from the beginning. I\u2019m not na\u00efve here. I think the Russians have asked for a lot of things dishonestly, but neutrality is clearly something that they see as existential for them. And then three, there\u2019s going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term. I think those three things are certainly achievable, yes.\n\n> *The critique of you and everyone else who opposed the recent appropriation was that if you can\u2019t demonstrate a durable commitment to Ukraine, then Russia doesn\u2019t have any incentive to make peace. If the Russians think they\u2019re winning, how do you give Putin an incentive to make a deal if you\u2019re cutting funding?*\n\n> The leverage that we have over the Russians is not, in my view, that we can indefinitely keep the Ukrainians in a successful defensive posture. Let me be clear about this: There is no way with our capacity and what Russia has been doing that we can hold off the Russians indefinitely.\nThere are two big points of leverage that we have. One, they could take over Ukraine, but they can\u2019t govern Ukraine. We\u2019re talking about multiple hundreds of thousands of troops to govern the country effectively as a Russian subsidiary. The second point of leverage that we have is a war economy has its own internal momentum. They\u2019re now at 7 percent of G.D.P. being spent on defense. They have re-engineered an economy around fighting a war instead of around improving the lives of your people. That has some real problems over the long term.\nBy the way, it\u2019s not in our interest, either, for the Russians to have a war economy for the next five years, because then they\u2019re going to be more militaristic and aggressive than they otherwise would be.\n\n> *You agree it\u2019s not in our interest right now for the Russians to roll through the rest of Ukraine?*\n\n> No, it is not in our interest.\n\nThere is much more to the interview, mostly domestic issues, but also a bit on broader foreign policy.\n\n> *How would you describe your foreign policy perspective?*\n\n> Not as \u201cPutin first,\u201d as maybe your readers would say \u2014\u2014\n\n> *I asked how you would describe it.*\n\n> I\u2019m very self-aware, Ross. Many flaws, that\u2019s not one of them. The term \u201crealist\u201d gets thrown around a lot, and I\u2019d say there are three pillars to realism in the 21st century: The first is that moralisms about \u201cThis country is good,\u201d \u201cThis country is bad\u201d are largely useless, and we should be dealing with other countries based on whether they\u2019re good or bad for America\u2019s interests. That doesn\u2019t mean you have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you\u2019re dealing with, and there\u2019s a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country.\n\n> No. 2 is the most important lesson of World War II, that we seem to have forgotten: that military power is downstream of industrial power. We are still, right now, the world\u2019s military superpower, largely because of our industrial might from the \u201980s and \u201990s. But China is a more powerful country industrially than we are, which means they will have a more powerful military in 20 years.\n\n> And No. 3 is acknowledging that we\u2019re in a multipolar world, and we need allies to step up in big ways so that we can focus on East Asia, which is where our most significant competitor is for the next 20 or 30 years.\n\n> *Should we defend Taiwan if it\u2019s attacked?*\n\n> Our policy effectively is one of strategic ambiguity. I think that we should make it as hard as possible for China to take Taiwan in the first place, and the honest answer is we\u2019ll figure out what we do if they attack. The thing that we can control now is making it costly for them to invade Taiwan, and we\u2019re not doing that because we\u2019re sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine and not Taiwan.",

I'm going to pick just three of them because they're specific to the US' European policy, so I'm more familiar with them. One is the \"traditional\" defense policy angle, one is of a diplomatic nature with military and economic consequences, and one is of a geopolitical nature with an eye towards future conflict. The first two are about eighty years old today.\n\nFirst the \"traditional\" one. One of the cornerstones of post-war (WWII, that is) American defence policy was that a single country or alliance of countries led by political ideologies opposed to those of the US should never again be able to control both the Eurasian basin and SE Asia. The alliance between Nazi Germany and Japan was the first one to pose an existential threat to the US since the the Revolutionary War, and it did so because it controlled sufficient resources (natural, economic, industrial, and above all human) to attain the engineering expertise and the industrial base that allowed it to project power in a way that rendered geographical barriers inefficient.\n\nIt's not like *everyone else did not get the memo* on this. It is no coincidence that Russia, China and several of their allies are working so tightly on this. Orban, Putin and even Xi, to some degree, may share most of the former US president's ideology (in effective terms: Xi is obviously not a Republican but if you swap out \"Communist Party\", \"socialism\" and \"Marx\" for \"the Republican Party\", \"democracy\" and \"Founding Fathers\" in Xi Jinping Thought you basically get MAGA with state-owned enterprises) but all three also share a thorough anti-American stance that has informed their strategy for practically as long as they have been in power. \n\nThe war in Ukraine affords the US a unique chance to attrite, or even deter one of its two major enemies (Russia) at a time when the other (China) is unable to intervene in its favour too effectively. As China pursues its goals in SE Asia, these two countries *will* work in tandem. This is a chance for the US and its allies to weaken one of their enemies' position, and potentially cripple it, prior to that engagement. \n\nIt's a chance that the US got by sheer luck (or, rather, through Russia's inept invasion plan). Normally, they wouldn't have had it, and five years from now they would've been fighting over Taiwan with NATO's position in Europe virtually crippled. Not making the most of it would be one of the worst blunders in military history. It's a chance to reduce, or outright eliminate China's upper hand over European economic and possibly military alignment.\n\nIn diplomatic terms, failing to deter Russia would signal a major change in the security landscape to the US' European allies. \n\nAn undeterred Russia is the single worst security threat for European democracies. Half the continent, including, critically, most of the countries in the two regions that are of the highest geopolitical importance at the moment (the Baltic and the Black Sea) have experienced Soviet occupation (so imagine Bucha, but several years, rather than several weeks) and Soviet-aligned governments, with half a century of international isolation and crippling economic and social under-development that they're still recovering from thirty-five years later. The other half of the continent has grappled with radical communist activity and the ever-looming shadow of imminent war. They are not keen on experiencing any of that again.\n\nThese countries will work with whoever can keep Russia in check. If it turns out that's not the US, and China can offer a credible enough arrangement, they will absolutely work with China. Nobody (for statistically significant values of nobody) cares that China is a communist dictatorship, what they are opposed to, specifically, is Russian involvement on the continent, because that has a centuries-old tradition of bringing nothing but abuse, poverty and corruption.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that they'll just turn tables and start cheering for comrade Xi. But they will also not take any meaningful steps to the economic disentanglement that the US needs if it hopes to regain its industrial momentum at China's expense, or shun China diplomatically.\n\nAnd more importantly, sufficiently strong signals of uninvolvement from the US, and an appeasing attitude towards Russia, may well be enough to make the US' European allies sit out on a conflict over Taiwan. The same logistical arguments would apply for them (\"the thing that we can control now is making it costly for them to invade us, so we should not be sending weapons to Taiwan\"), and it makes no political sense to back an iffy ally in a conflict with a major power whose main ally is on your border and pursuing an ardently irredentist line for twenty years, including by military means. \n\nIf the US signals that the only way for its European allies to minimize Russian involvement is to compromise with Russia over territory and political influence, then that's exactly what they'll do, and if diplomats in Beijing and Moscow aren't orange cats, they will certainly use that influence to keep the US isolated in a SE Asian conflict.",

In 2001, Russia was *not* a major contender for political and military supremacy in Europe, the federal government could barely keep Russia together. A decisive victory in Ukraine is the first step towards making Russia a major contender for political and military supremacy in Europe again. A decisive *defeat* would remove Russia from that position for the most plausible immediate time window of a conflict with China over Taiwan, before, during, and after which European support is very important for the US.\n\n> Yes, which is the exact opposite of what OP wanted. A decisive Ukrainian victory would likely entail not attriting Russia's stockpile.\n\nFirst of all, there is no decisive Ukrainian victory without significant attrition of Russian stockpiles. This whole distinction is meaningless. Ukraine does not have the means to impose an immediate, unconditional surrender of Russian troops, and there is no way to supply these means without an untenable escalation risk. A decisive Ukrainian victory would literally entail exactly that attrition.\n\nBut if attriting Russian stockpiles is a major concern, you know what guarantees it won't happen? An immediate peace under duress, which puts an immediate halt to attrition, and which, by ensuring nominal Ukrainian neutrality, ensures that Russia can divert all its current military-industrial complex towards supporting the re-arming of its own, along with Iran's and China's, regional allies.\n\nFurthermore, this rests on a complete misunderstanding of how the Russian political establishment works, both by the current vice-presidential nominee and by many of his supporters. I understand where they're coming from but they're thinking of Russia like it's America with vodka. It's not, it works by completely different rules and comes from a completely different political tradition.\n\nIf the war in Ukraine were to end tomorrow, you think, what, Uralvagonzavod will just close down and go back to half-shifts two days a week, instead of just keeping on rolling to keep troublemakers employed, spend all the funds that suddenly became available for social welfare under the guise of employment, and get the stockpiles replenished to what they were before the war, or at least to high enough levels to try again?\n\nYes, that would make zero sense in the US, where the MIC began to shrink as soon as the Cold War was over, under the pressure of public accountability and real market economy. Neither of these things exist in post-2022 Russia.\n\nI would also note that you're only quoting half of my argument. I said that the war in Ukraine offers an unique opportunity to attrite and even deter China's major partner, not that \"the war in Ukraine affords the US a unique chance to attrite\". If you're not going to debate in good faith, I'm sure our friends in /r/noncredibledefence would welcome your memes.\n\n>> If the US signals that the only way for its European allies to minimize Russian involvement is to compromise with Russia over territory and political influence\n> Who said *anything* about this?\n\nOne of the two presidential candidates and their nominated VP, both of whom are literally on the record stating that they think Ukraine must make territorial concessions and align their foreign policy with Russia's immediate interests.\n\nWhen you hear someone asking why the US would care about the outcome of a regional war in Eastern Europe, that question applies equally well to a Russian invasion of Ukraine as it does to a Russian invasion of Estonia, or Hungary, or Romania, or Bulgaria. Article 5 only commits NATO countries to \"such action as [each country] deems necessary\".

The pre-2013 security framework was also developed under international collaboration to which both the US and China were parties. The binding treaties themselves were bilateral, sure, but they were developed on the basis of the Budapest Memorandum, which saw ample international participation.\n\nIt's not just a matter of trustworthiness. Russia holding political control over Ukraine (and significant territorial control in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov) is of major interest to China. Why would China broker a peace treaty that's not favourable to their own interests?\n\n> I also think Hungary would not veto Ukraine. They simply cannot be the sole nay-vote in such a vote. They managed to squirm for quite some time in the Swedish nato membership, but trying to block Ukraine would yield 20-times the political pressure.\n\nDepending on how a hypothetical peace treaty signed under duress would look, they may not need to be the only naysayers. Even as early as two years ago (June 2022), in addition to the usual suspects (Slovakia) there was significant opposition from Denmark and the Netherlands, presumably over economic issues.\n\nBesides, trying to block Ukraine would yield 20-times the political pressure from some EU members, but leting it pass would also yield 20-times the political pressure from Moscow.\n\nIt's tempting to compare this to Swedish NATO membership but it's not exactly the same thing.

        "body": "The Kyiv Post has posted reporting on an investigation into the 59th and possible incompetence in their leadership leading to recent losses in men, equipment, and defensive positions/towns.  \n\n[ Army to Investigate Infantry Brigade Over Claims of Defeat in Pokrovsk Sector | Kyiv Post | July 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/35844)\n\n*The Ukrainian military\u2019s overall commander General Oleksandr Syrsky on Monday ordered a formal investigation into allegations top officers in a combat brigade deployed to the critical eastern Pokrovsk sector had lost ground and soldier lives because of tactical incompetence.*\n\n*Official army sources said the unit was holding its ground in heavy combat and that claims of problems inside the brigade were overblown. An officer from the 59th Motorized Infantry Brigade contacted by Kyiv Post said the same thing.*\n\n*According to a Monday statement from Ukraine\u2019s Army General Staff (AGS), a top-level Army Chief of Staff (ACS) evaluation team would \u201cconduct checks\u201d among staff serving with the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade to clarify \u201ccircumstances of recent losses of personnel.\u201d*\n\n*Since taking over command of the Ukrainian military in February 2024, Syrsky, a commander with a reputation for demanding discipline and strict enforcement of the chain of command from subordinates, has rarely made public possible internal problems in a combat unit.*\n\n*A longstanding fighting formation with combat experience in the southern Kherson and eastern Donbas sectors, the 59th Brigade, according to open-source reports, is deployed to the west of the city of Donetsk, the site of a major Russian offensive aiming for the regional road hub of Pokrovsk.*\n\n*The Monday morning Ukrainian army daily situation update identified the Pokrovsk sector as the single most kinetic sector of the entire fighting front, with 35 Russian attacks against Ukrainian positions in the past 24 hours. The battlefield situation was \u201ctense\u201d but Ukrainian forces were holding, that statement said.*\n\n*The General Syrsky-signed announcement that the 59th Brigade, a key piece of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\u2019s (AFU) defenses in Ukraine\u2019s east, would be investigated followed one day after allegations by Kateryna Polishchuk, a high-profile volunteer medic and survivor of the 2022 Mariupol Siege, of possible leadership problems inside the unit.*\n\n*In posts to Facebook and other social media, Polishchuk charged the 59th Brigade\u2019s top officers with tactical incompetence and having been promoted thanks to nepotism.*\n\n*Using terms like \u201clawlessness,\u201d \u201cthoughtless criminal orders,\u201d and \u201ccompletely unnecessary losses,\u201d Polishchuk, an internet personality best known for her nickname \u201cPtashka\u201d (Birdie) and bravery medals given her by President Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the 59th brigade commander of having ordered key senior personnel from the brigade staff to front lines to serve as infantrymen, where most were killed or wounded.*\n\n*\u201cA few weeks ago, on his direct order, almost the entire top intelligence of the brigade was sent to the advanced positions, absolutely without any need for it. As a result: the intelligence chief of the brigade \u2013 killed, the artillery chief of one of the attached battalions \u2013 killed, the chief sergeant of the intelligence company \u2013 killed, the commander of the intelligence company \u2013 wounded\u2026by these actions the commanding general destroyed the entire intelligence management unit of the brigade,\u201d Polishchuk claimed.*\n\n*In a Sunday Facebook post, Polishchuk said the investigation should look into: \u201ccriminal orders, deliberate negligence, disregard for the life and health of personnel, actions that led to the deaths of a large number of military personnel, including those from high leadership positions, selfishness, blind careerism, the sacking of commanders \u201cin disagreement\u201d\u2026(and)\u2026inhumane and unprofessional attitude.\u201d She went on to announce her group was ending ambulance and evacuation support to the brigade.*\n\n*Other Ukrainian media widely covered the Russian offensive towards Pokrovsk and, like Polishchuk, identified the 59th Brigade commander by name and pointed to the town Krasnohorivka as the scene of a recent, bloody Ukrainian defeat purportedly caused by poor leadership.*\n\n*Kyiv Post was unable to contact the officer for comment about the allegations made against him.*\n\n*Elements of the 59th Brigade, in the first two weeks of July, were hit by repeated Russian attacks and lost control of most of Krasnohorivka \u2013 a tactically important town some 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the west of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk.*\n\n*High-profile Ukrainian military correspondent Yury Butusov was one of the first to raise a red flag that the situation Krasnohorivka was deteriorating, reporting on July 2 that the 59th Brigade commander had been promoted too quickly because of nepotism, and that the Russian assault towards Pokrovsk caught him and his staff flat-footed.*\n\n*\u201c(The 59th Brigade commander) does not cope with his duties, battles are going on in the city, the enemy is advancing, and the complete loss of the city of Krasnohorivka is becoming real\u2026The situation is critical, the enemy has an advantage, so let's improve at least what we can quickly change \u2013 the quality of management, the order and organization of our forces, Butusov wrote, calling on Syrsky to overhaul brigade leadership. There was no clear official response to the journalist\u2019s public appeal.*\n\n*The medic Polishchuk\u2019s demand that Syrsky do something about alleged chaos in 59th Brigade\u2019s senior command group, and purported heavy losses of ground in Krasnohorivka and defensive positions nearby, came nearly two weeks after Butusov\u2019s report.*\n\n*Polishchuk in other claims accused 59th Brigade leadership of launching recently recruited troops assigned to the unit to bloody and unsuccessful attempts to regain lost ground with counterattacks \u2013 although the soldiers had less than two months of training. Fighting the Russian army by micromanagement, without visiting the front line, is ineffective, Butusov charged.*\n\n*Serhiy Tsekhotsky, an officer serving with the 59th for more than two years, in comments to Kyiv Post rejected those claims.*\n\n*He said the brigade and Ukrainian defenses around it were not only holding their ground, but inflicting crushing damage on Russian personnel and combat equipment.*\n\n*\u201cWe are cutting them to pieces,\u201d Tsekhotsky said. \u201cTheir losses are massive.\u201d*\n\n*Tsekhotsky said that according to official brigade counts, over June, men and officers from the 59th claimed credit for the destruction of 2,969 Russian service personnel in battle. That figure is consistent with heavy Russian losses registered by independent observers, among them Iceland\u2019s Ragnarr Gudmundsson.*\n\n*Tsekhotsky told Kyiv Post the Syrsky-ordered inspection would find a combat-capable unit with a strong command staff and said the inspectors could conclude Polishchuk\u2019s allegations against the brigade\u2019s senior officers were personally motivated.*\n\n*The Kremlin has called the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region a war aim and for more than eighteen months has gradually expanded control over the region using high casualty, but sometimes successful, infantry attacks, backed by artillery and air strikes.*\n\n*According to Kremlin claims, Ukrainian forces elsewhere in the eastern sector lost ground with the Russian capture of the villages of Novoselivka Persha, Yasnobrodivka and Progress.*\n\n*The independent military information platform DeepState confirmed the Ukrainian losses, however, Joint Forces Khortytsia, the Ukrainian army overall command headquarters in the eastern sector, claimed Ukrainian forces were holding at all those locations. A morning AGS situation estimate reported heavy fighting but no loss of ground.*\n\n*A Monday UNIAN news agency report said that Russia\u2019s heaviest assaults \u2013 usually a mix of infantry backed by artillery and air strikes \u2013 currently were targeting the village of Novooleksandrivka, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) to the east of Pokrovsk.*",

There was no clear official response to the journalist\u2019s public appeal.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The medic Polishchuk\u2019s demand that Syrsky do something about alleged chaos in 59th Brigade\u2019s senior command group, and purported heavy losses of ground in Krasnohorivka and defensive positions nearby, came nearly two weeks after Butusov\u2019s report.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Polishchuk in other claims accused 59th Brigade leadership of launching recently recruited troops assigned to the unit to bloody and unsuccessful attempts to regain lost ground with counterattacks \u2013 although the soldiers had less than two months of training. Fighting the Russian army by micromanagement, without visiting the front line, is ineffective, Butusov charged.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Serhiy Tsekhotsky, an officer serving with the 59th for more than two years, in comments to Kyiv Post rejected those claims.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>He said the brigade and Ukrainian defenses around it were not only holding their ground, but inflicting crushing damage on Russian personnel and combat equipment.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe are cutting them to pieces,\u201d Tsekhotsky said. \u201cTheir losses are massive.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Tsekhotsky said that according to official brigade counts, over June, men and officers from the 59th claimed credit for the destruction of 2,969 Russian service personnel in battle. That figure is consistent with heavy Russian losses registered by independent observers, among them Iceland\u2019s Ragnarr Gudmundsson.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Tsekhotsky told Kyiv Post the Syrsky-ordered inspection would find a combat-capable unit with a strong command staff and said the inspectors could conclude Polishchuk\u2019s allegations against the brigade\u2019s senior officers were personally motivated.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Kremlin has called the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region a war aim and for more than eighteen months has gradually expanded control over the region using high casualty, but sometimes successful, infantry attacks, backed by artillery and air strikes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>According to Kremlin claims, Ukrainian forces elsewhere in the eastern sector lost ground with the Russian capture of the villages of Novoselivka Persha, Yasnobrodivka and Progress.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The independent military information platform DeepState confirmed the Ukrainian losses, however, Joint Forces Khortytsia, the Ukrainian army overall command headquarters in the eastern sector, claimed Ukrainian forces were holding at all those locations. A morning AGS situation estimate reported heavy fighting but no loss of ground.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A Monday UNIAN news agency report said that Russia\u2019s heaviest assaults \u2013 usually a mix of infantry backed by artillery and air strikes \u2013 currently were targeting the village of Novooleksandrivka, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) to the east of Pokrovsk.</em></p>\n</div>",

They do need 10+ drones to do a rotation on the same spot because each drone has finite uptime and they need virtually constant uptime at the front because of the nature of the relentless small wave assaults. <strong>Any infantry without drone awareness is as good as dead.</strong> There aren\u2019t 10s of thousands in the air at the same time, but they are mixed and staggered throughout the day and night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the part in bold was true and Ukraine had tens of thousands of drones in the air at the same time - which is more than enough to cover all Russian-occupied trenches - then all Russian infantry is as good as dead. But quite obviously they&#39;re not, because they lose something like 1000 men (not all KIA) per day rather than the 50-100k troops that would be spotted by tens of thousands of drones &quot;in the air at the same time&quot; all day, every day.</p>\n\n<p>I think you need a serious reality check on the capability of cheap drones.</p>\n</div>",
