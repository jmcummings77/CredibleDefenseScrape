Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Most war games suggest China would need to engage in a region-wide first strike against US bases to stand a chance in a cross-strait invasion, including first strikes on bases in Japan. Thus, some of the very first shots of the war would obligate Japan to participate unless they are ready to forgo the benefits of the mutual defense treaty altogether. \n\nThe Japanese government has no power to limit how the US uses those bases, so even if the Japanese are not particularly interested in participating in a war against China, the Chinese will almost necessarily have to trigger their obligations under the mutual defense treaty by attacking bases on Japanese soil. There is no guarantee that the Japanese would follow the terms of the defense treaty, but failing to do so would risk losing the immense benefits of living under US protection, during a situation where regional stability is under assault and that protection is thus all the more valuable to them. So I don't think you will see them sit things out.\n\nVoter sentiment will change when a real threat emerges. People tend to express more pacifist perspectives when presented with vague or unlikely scenarios, but when confronted with the reality of foreign state aggression they change their tune, as /u/FriedrichvdPfalz describes occurring in Eastern Europe well below. You can tell because of how irrational this perspective is: \"Most people in Japan (56 percent) favor only a logistical supporting role for Japan in the event of war over Taiwan\" There is zero chance that Japan would be able to play a purely logistical role, because China will of course want to interdict any Taiwan-allied logistics. Thus, at a minimum, requiring Japan to defend its own infrastructure. Meaning, even if they do not participate in operations around or on Taiwan, they will provide a critical role in securing aerial and maritime lines of communication into the theater of operations.\n\nWars also do not happen in isolation. China attacking Taiwan likely will involve increased antics from North Korea and possibly from Russia (which, it helps to remember, has an active and historically rancorous territorial dispute with Japan). So even if the Japanese do not want to get involved in a war with China, they may be willing and able to check interference from North Korea or Russia that US forces would otherwise need to deal with, effectively freeing up US resources for operations around Taiwan.",
