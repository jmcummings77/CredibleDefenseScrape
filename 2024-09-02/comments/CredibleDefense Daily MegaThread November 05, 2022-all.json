The US has obviously supplied a lot of Phoenix ghost systems. This is described as a loitering munition, yet we've seen basically no footage of the system in action or more surprisingly any debris from the Russians. Oryx has 700ish being prior delivered with another 1,100 on the way as part of the latest aid package. I wonder if these are being used as ISR/recon instead of their intended role as a suicide munition. I'm a little surprised we haven't seen any operating footage but VERY surprised we haven't seen debris. Some folks were speculating these are just alibaba drones, I'm speculative. The US has a lot of drone programs going on right now and it isn't hard to believe they had a good platform ready to go. \n\n2. The Switchblade 600 reportedly is ready to produce at a run-rate of [160ish a month, with the potential to expand up to 500ish. ](https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/ausa/2022/10/11/switchblade-kamikaze-drone-production-to-ramp-up-following-ukraine-use/) If the platform is as capable as they market it as and they can really hit these numbers, this should be a big game changer. That's alot of loitering munitions to throw in the sky and potentially a big problem for the Russians. But here's the question, if they're really ready to go why hasn't the Pentagon gone and procured them yet? [The drone should be in-country any day now, ](https://www.yahoo.com/video/ukraine-awaits-supplies-switchblade-600-113100171.html) the initial procurement order was pretty small so I do suspect they want to see how it performs before making a bigger order. If the system does work how they're describing I do think it'll be a big capability bump for the Ukrainians, if I recall correctly they currently don't have a system that can reach out this far with as large a payload. It appears comparable to NLOS, which [Rob Lee was saying would have been very helpful for Ukraine during the summer](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1518756069048487936)\n\n3. I feel pretty confident the Pentagon is providing drones to Ukraine that they haven't listed in the official aid packages. It just makes too much sense, Ukraine needs them, the Pentagon wants to trial them, and they have plenty of providers to choose from. Drones don't take nearly as long to design/deliver as other kinds of hardware, so I think NATO innovation in this space is likely to be ongoing. I do think Ukraine either has or will have a qualitative/quantitative advantage in drone munitions and drone-based ISR. The capability of the West to supply drones is just going to be much larger and of higher quality than whatever Iran/Russia can produce. \n\n4. I do feel Ukranian OPSEC around the use of NATO/High Quality drones is pretty tight. You don't see a ton of use footage of switchblades/Warmates/Western Recon UAVs. Implication to me here is these drones are being reserved for dedicated formations, while the DJJ/Alibaba stuff filters down to the unit level. This is also probably a limiter on what OSINT can do, if formations aren't show off the capabilities and limitations of these platforms you generally aren't going to know about them. I do think a lot of the switchblade 300 criticism comes down to \"we haven't seen them\". Well maybe the Ukrainians just aren't showing them off, I don't think that's sufficient to demonstrate the platform is a failure",

After they beat back the UAF who take heavy casualties, they leapfrog back to the next line, covered by arty and mines, falling back and collapsing the overall perimeter rearwards towards the crossing point, all while less needed units cross the Dnieper. If they believe the UAF will attack in force as they are retreating, the Russians will be very motivated to find ways to slow them down, dissuade them, and that means lots of ambushes, mines, booby traps, destroyed roads and bridges, etc. This is bread and butter maneuver defense, which is heavily emphasized in Russian operational theory and doctrine. \n\nNow the Ukrainian brass likely suspect that, so assuming the open source reports of Russian retreat are true, they still won't attack right now, just wait. Use the time to solidify planning of their offensive, maybe even do some sand table briefings and rehearsals, stockpile munitions forward, get vehicles ready, and concentrate forces at assembly areas. \n\nIf the Russians really want to retreat but are planning those baited ambushes, if the Ukrainians don't take the bait eventually the Russians will still need to follow the phased withdrawal timeline and that means their rear guard will be forced to leapfrog back to the next line of defenses back without a fight. But even if that happens, it doesn't suddenly give the UAF a major advantage.\n\nJust imagining how this retreat can be done has me excited. If the Russians don't fuck it up they might be able to disengage from the front lines without issues, and if so it's going to be tough for the Ukrainians to get after them. Reports that the Russians had reinforcing the Kherson bridgehead with Mobiks might mean the Russians are already now deployed in depth, so the fall back lines might already be manned, and those defenses just as strong as the front lines, or even better because they have the ability to cross into the engagement areas to set them up. Potentially all routes from the first to the second line will be obstructed by mud or minefields, with limited designated lanes for retreating Russian rear guard forces to pass through the second line, to keep going to a third line of defenses or beyond.\n\nThe Kherson bridgehead campaign really can turn into a great lesson on real Russian capabilities, how well they can fight when they're actually concentrated, alert, and focused.",

If the Russians don&#39;t fuck it up they might be able to disengage from the front lines without issues, and if so it&#39;s going to be tough for the Ukrainians to get after them. Reports that the Russians had reinforcing the Kherson bridgehead with Mobiks might mean the Russians are already now deployed in depth, so the fall back lines might already be manned, and those defenses just as strong as the front lines, or even better because they have the ability to cross into the engagement areas to set them up. Potentially all routes from the first to the second line will be obstructed by mud or minefields, with limited designated lanes for retreating Russian rear guard forces to pass through the second line, to keep going to a third line of defenses or beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The Kherson bridgehead campaign really can turn into a great lesson on real Russian capabilities, how well they can fight when they&#39;re actually concentrated, alert, and focused.</p>\n</div>",

Protesters shouted anti-government slogans including \"Death to Khamenei\" and \"Death to Raisi\", provoking security forces into conflict.

Law enforcement agencies used tear gas. \u25aa\ufe0fOn November 4, after Friday prayers, protests erupted in the provinces of Sistan and Balochistan. The rebels, ignoring the calls of the police, tried to storm the administrative and police buildings. Security forces opened fire on demonstrators in the city of Khash. Over 10 died and many were injured. Sunni cleric Abdul Hamid called for a referendum in Iran under the supervision of foreign observers in order to \"fulfill the demands of the people.\" \u25aa\ufe0fOn the same day, anti-American demonstrations took place throughout Iran in connection with the anniversary of the capture of the US Embassy in 1979. More than 100 thousand people in more than 100 cities and towns opposed American domination of the world and in support of the current government. \u25aa\ufe0f On November 5, rallies were held in a dozen cities of Iran.

The anti-Iranian media are actively using disinformation for their own purposes, talking about the \u201coutrages\u201d of the security forces and covering up the chaos created by the rebels with their actions. The main task is to demonize the authorities in the face of the whole world. \ud83d\udd3bThese riots are the longest in Iranian history, triggered by a slight tightening of social norms. After a certain liberalization of society during the Rouhani era, Raisi's conservative policies were met with hostility by ordinary people. The lack of concessions and unwillingness to make concessions in the absence of a violent suppression of protests (neither the Army nor the IRGC are still involved) show some indecision of the leadership. This is exactly what the opposition uses, urging the people not to be afraid and to go against the authorities. The Iranian government faces an extremely difficult task. If they agree to give in to some of the demands of the protesters, then this may create a precedent for the opposition in the future - in this way you can achieve your goals. With a forceful decision, you need to act as quickly and decisively as possible in order to suppress the hotbeds of tension and prevent escalation. At the same time, this will establish the image of \"evil Iran\" in the face of the collective West for many years and block all efforts to restore the country's reputation. \ud83d\udd3b However, protests need to be dealt with as soon as possible, the longer they last, the more unpredictable their consequences will be. Dragging out contradictions will weaken the administrative resource more and more every day and deepen the internal crisis. And the regularly emerging hotbeds of tension are fertile ground for the spread of terrorism.

Xi and Scholz agreed to oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, according to Mr. Scholz and a report by Xinhua, which normally echoes Beijing\u2019s official positions.\n\nThe international community should \u201coppose the use of or the threat to use nuclear weapons, advocate that nuclear weapons cannot be used and that nuclear wars must not be fought, and prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia,\u201d Mr. Xi said according to Xinhua.\n\nThe comment, the first rebuke of its kind attributed to the Chinese leader since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, marks a change in tone for Beijing after the government there said last week that it would deepen its cooperation with Russia at all levels, experts said.\n\n\u201cBeijing genuinely does not want a nuclear attack or war,\u201d said Francesca Ghiretti, an analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.\n\n\u201cOpposing the use of nuclear weapons and threats is a low hanging fruit and low-cost statement to achieve international approval and positive spillover for the German-China relationship, and perhaps that with the EU, too,\u201d she added.\n\nWhile Mr. Xi\u2019s comments would be noted in Moscow, said Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, they should not be read as meaning China would be willing or able to influence any decision by the Kremlin to escalate the war by using nonconventional weapons.\n\n\u201cThe brutal reality is if Putin gets to the point where he is willing to use nuclear weapons, Beijing\u2019s leverage over him is close to zero,\u201d he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nEfforts for a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine conflict and avoiding a greater humanitarian crisis are also required, the Chinese leader said, according to Xinhua.\n\nMr. Putin has made several thinly veiled threats about using nuclear weapons in Ukraine or against Kyiv\u2019s allies if they got too deeply involved in the conflict. Open nuclear threats against North Atlantic Treaty Organization members are aired almost daily by Russian state broadcasters. Last week, Mr. Putin and Russian diplomats seemed to reverse course, with the Russian president saying there was no need to use nuclear weapons on Ukraine.\n\nRussia\u2019s armed forces are believed by Western experts to have as many as 2,000 so-called tactical nuclear weapons stored in special locations around the country, including some located close to Ukraine. These weapons, which include artillery shells, have much smaller yields than the warheads in the American and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals but can inflict far bigger damage than conventional ordnance.\n\nThe rhetoric has caused Western leaders to grow alarmed that Mr. Putin could seek to reverse his troops\u2019 poor showing on the battlefield by detonating a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe agree that nuclear threats are extremely dangerous,\u201d Mr. Scholz, the first Group of Seven leader to visit Beijing since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, tweeted after his meeting with Mr. Xi. \u201cThe use of such weapons would cross a red line,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said that he asked Mr. Xi to bring his influence on Russia to bear.",

Are you disputing that the attempts largely fail, or that casualties from a failed frontal assault are often significant? Just do the math.</p>\n</div>",

Depicting the West as morally degenerate is a classic propaganda play that dates right back to at least WWII Nazi Germany.

In November 2021, Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden held a virtual one-on-one summit.\n\nDuring the summit, Chinese state broadcaster China Global Television Network reported that \"Xi said the Chinese people have always loved and valued peace, adding that aggression or hegemony is not in the blood of the Chinese nation.\"\n\nCiting the Chinese president, it added: \"Since the founding of the People's Republic, China has never started a single war or conflict, and has never taken one inch of land from other countries.\"\n\nTo assess this claim, Newsweek spoke to a number of experts on Chinese history and culture, all of whom said the claim was untrue.\n\n**Michael Szonyi**, the Frank Wen-hsiung Wu Professor of Chinese History at Harvard University, called the statement \"nonsense\" and cited the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979.\n\nThe Sino-Indian War launched with a surprise Chinese attack on October 20, 1962, with the People's Liberation Army driving with overwhelming force through the eastern and western sections of the Himalayas, deep into northeastern India. Thirty-two days later, Beijing announced a ceasefire.\n\nThe Sino-Vietnamese war, a similarly brief border conflict, was initiated by China, although it lasted only 29 days.\n\nSzonyi, a Fellow of the Public Intellectuals Program of the National Committee on US-China relations, said these were the most straightforward examples.\n\n\"If one does not accept PRC claims to sovereignty over Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan, then the number grows much larger,\" he added. \"China certainly comes out ahead compared to the United States, but that is not what this claim says.\"\n\n**Professor Robert Bickers** of the University of Bristol, who specializes in modern Chinese history, also labeled the claim tweeted by Dotcom \"nonsense\" and noted other engagements such as a Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, attacks on Taiwanese forces in 1954 and 1958, and attacks on Soviet border troops in 1969.\n\n**Julia Lovell**, a professor of modern China at Birkbeck College, University of London, and author of Maoism: A Global History, also highlighted how \"Mao-era China set up training courses for international revolutionaries and guerrillas (from a wide range of places: Southern Rhodesia, Peru, Columbia, Burma, India) in China.\"\n\n\"The future leader of the Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, attributed his political/military awakening to such a visit. Josiah Tongogara, the future military leader of ZANU in Zimbabwe, studied military science in Nanjing, China,\" she said.\n\nLovell said the chapter in her book on Maoism in South Asia \"describes how the Beijing government applauded the Naxalite insurgency in north India in the late 1960s.\"\n\nShe added: \"China under Mao also offered material aid to a number of insurgencies, most notably the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.\"\n\nChina's recent military posturing has caught the attention of the world. In a series of videos posted in July, tanks were seen moving through the streets of Rizhao City in Shandong province.\n\nFirst thought to be related to banking protests in Henan, it was later linked to military exercises amid escalating tensions between China and Taiwan.",

        "body": "So, although I considered it likely Russia was going to lose the war before the general invasion started in February, and I have not been convinced otherwise since, I was still thinking what the Russian theory of victory is and what could be the plausible developments to still provide Russia a victory (a pyrrhic one and still a strategic defeat).\n\nIn general, two things need to happen.\n\n1) Russia needs to regenerate their combat power and manage to regenerate it for a long time. I.e Russia needs to get stronger\n\n2) Russia needs to destroy Ukraine's ability to regenerate their combat power and diminish it over time. I.e Ukraine needs to get weaker.\n\nFor Russian strength I see a few options.\n\n1a Russia transitions to an actual war economy, rapid expansion of arms manufacturing, with particular focus on restoring mothballed capabilities and generation of new long-range fire capabilities as these are two Russian advantages over Ukraine (mass of old equipment, mass and quality of long range fires)\n\n1b China starts supplying Russian army. China's industrial might is similar to that of the Collective West and would absolutely be a game changer.\n\n1c Russia does additional rounds of mobilization, but proper one like Ukraine, where soldiers are trained for 6 months, trained together in their units and producing highly capable new units.\n\nTwo of these should be enough to guarantee that Russian army becomes stronger every day.\n\nFor weakening Ukraine I have a few thoughts.\n\nCombat power consists of numerous supporting pillars. Just naming a few: manpower, both quality and quantity, ground forces, air forces, long-range fires, morale at home, morale at the front, communications, logistics, industrial base etc. As an example, if combat power consists of 10 pillars, if you destroy 10% of all of the pillars of the enemy, the combat power roughly decreases by 10%. But if you destroy 100% of one of the pillars, the impact on combat power is far more than 10%. Russia needs to find the one-two pillars that they can feasibly destroy and that will have that oversized impact.\n\n2a Russia needs to destroy Ukrainian air-defense capability. By destroying Ukrainian aircraft and by forcing Ukraine to expend their AD ammunition (there is no way Russia manages to destroy enough AD launchers and platforms). \n\n2b Russia must make all in their power to maintain the current situation where the West does not supply Ukraine with Western aircrafts.\n\n2c Destroy Ukraine's economy and state capacity by all means possible. Even though Russia claims they are fighting NATO and even though Western aid is important, at the moment Ukrainian economy and society at large is what keeps 90% of the Ukrainian army going. Destroy Ukrainian energy infrastructure as energy is by far the most important multiplier in economic output (if both the energy sector and tourism sector provide 5% of a countries GDP, if you completely eliminate tourism, the grand effect on economy is slightly more than 5%, if you eliminate energy, the impact is nearly 100%).\n\n2d Try to eliminate Zelensky and as much high-ranking politicians, bureaucrats and commanders as possible. Ukrainian state will not cease to exist if you kill Zelensky, but I have a strong suspicion that Ukraine loses a lot of international legitimacy without him.\n\nAnd I am entirely aware that none of these things are easy to do and will make it difficult to achieve simultaneously (destroying Ukrainian air-defense and energy infrastructure makes it likelier that Ukraine gets Western aircrafts).\n\nIf in a year's time Russia still holds the Dnieper line in the south, Ukraine does not have western aircraft, the Russian army in Ukraine is stronger than today and Ukraine's economy is completely dysfunctional, I would consider it possible that Ukraine would be willing to a conditional surrender.",

Ukrainian state will not cease to exist if you kill Zelensky, but I have a strong suspicion that Ukraine loses a lot of international legitimacy without him.</p>\n\n<p>And I am entirely aware that none of these things are easy to do and will make it difficult to achieve simultaneously (destroying Ukrainian air-defense and energy infrastructure makes it likelier that Ukraine gets Western aircrafts).</p>\n\n<p>If in a year&#39;s time Russia still holds the Dnieper line in the south, Ukraine does not have western aircraft, the Russian army in Ukraine is stronger than today and Ukraine&#39;s economy is completely dysfunctional, I would consider it possible that Ukraine would be willing to a conditional surrender.</p>\n</div>",

Whether you want to wear a black or white hat (or both), make sure you get in some competitions so that you know how to attack and defend, learn how to gain root and exploit privileges. You don\u2019t have to participate in God tier DEFCON competitions either, any low level thing you find fun will do. Your school will almost certainly host one anyway.\n\nAside from that, pick an expertise. Advanced network security is a speciality, hacking binaries is a speciality (software security), creating your own back doors is a specialty (OS Security). Each one of those will have a dedicated class in your school.\n\nYou asked about programming, while sure you need to understand programming a lot of it is actually understanding the layers that go much deeper than surface programming (we 100% must go derper - assembly is unavoidable in security - get to memorize instructions) or networks (different protocol levels of a packet)- can you automatically change every piece of a packet that is changeable that you send towards your victim? Can you understand what makes a malicious packet a malicious packet in real time? It\u2019s plumbing stuff that isn\u2019t sexy but is needed. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to know all that now, this isn\u2019t gatekeeping, you will be taught it. But it can be excruciating to learn if you are taking high level exams on it and also have a life and a family - you will be *graded* and you will be competing against brilliant people - some of who will lend help if you ask for it.\n\nStill, if you are into it you will be creating cool things, imagine you create a reflector that takes literally every packet, swaps the info in it, and reflect it back on your attacker. Your attacker is now literally hacking herself with her own packets.\n\nKind of like an older brother who grabs someone\u2019s arms and hits them with it. \n\nStop hacking yourself, stop hacking yourself.",

That\u2019s no fun.</p>\n\n<p>That same school offers a Masters in Cyber Security Engineering which is the reputable side. Whether you want to wear a black or white hat (or both), make sure you get in some competitions so that you know how to attack and defend, learn how to gain root and exploit privileges. You don\u2019t have to participate in God tier DEFCON competitions either, any low level thing you find fun will do. Your school will almost certainly host one anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from that, pick an expertise. Advanced network security is a speciality, hacking binaries is a speciality (software security), creating your own back doors is a specialty (OS Security). Each one of those will have a dedicated class in your school.</p>\n\n<p>You asked about programming, while sure you need to understand programming a lot of it is actually understanding the layers that go much deeper than surface programming (we 100% must go derper - assembly is unavoidable in security - get to memorize instructions) or networks (different protocol levels of a packet)- can you automatically change every piece of a packet that is changeable that you send towards your victim? Can you understand what makes a malicious packet a malicious packet in real time? It\u2019s plumbing stuff that isn\u2019t sexy but is needed. </p>\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to know all that now, this isn\u2019t gatekeeping, you will be taught it. But it can be excruciating to learn if you are taking high level exams on it and also have a life and a family - you will be <em>graded</em> and you will be competing against brilliant people - some of who will lend help if you ask for it.</p>\n\n<p>Still, if you are into it you will be creating cool things, imagine you create a reflector that takes literally every packet, swaps the info in it, and reflect it back on your attacker. Your attacker is now literally hacking herself with her own packets.</p>\n\n<p>Kind of like an older brother who grabs someone\u2019s arms and hits them with it. </p>\n\n<p>Stop hacking yourself, stop hacking yourself.</p>\n</div>",
