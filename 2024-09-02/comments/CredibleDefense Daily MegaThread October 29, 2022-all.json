Tehran has taken its fight against the West to Europe.*\n\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2022/10/26/iran-ukraine-russia-war-drones-missiles-military-advisors-middle-east-nuclear/\n\nFor the first time, Iran is involved in a major war on the European continent. Iranian military advisors, most likely members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are on the ground in occupied Ukraine\u2014and possibly Belarus\u2014to help Russia rain down deadly Iranian kamikaze drones on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. According to an Israeli news report citing a Ukrainian official, 10 Iranians have already been killed in a Ukrainian attack on Russian positions. Tehran is now preparing to up the ante by providing Russia not only with potentially thousands of additional drones but also, for the first time, with two types of Iranian-made ballistic missiles to supplement Russia\u2019s own dwindling stocks.\n\nTehran\u2019s military support is already making its deadly mark on the war, but the geopolitical consequences extend much further. By escalating its support for Russia\u2019s imperial attempt to subjugate Ukraine, Iran hopes to advance its own imperial project in the Middle East. Tehran will likely seek to leverage the deepening Russo-Iranian partnership into arms deals from Moscow while using lessons learned from the Ukrainian battlefield to perfect Iranian drone and missile capabilities. At the same time, the regime in Iran likely hopes that fueling the crisis in Ukraine will further distract the West from confronting Iran\u2019s pursuit of hegemony in the Middle East. With any luck, however, Tehran\u2019s foray into European power politics could help nudge Washington and its Western allies toward a more robust policy to counter Iran.\n\nTo redress battlefield weaknesses hampering its eight-month war against Ukraine, Russia has found a willing supporter. Tehran, which has poured considerable resources and effort into its drone and missile programs since the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, has reportedly supplied Moscow with hundreds of drones of various types. They include the Shahed-136, a so-called loitering munition that Moscow has rebranded as the Geran-2, designed to careen into its target kamikaze-style. In addition to helping Russian forces take out stationary targets near the front lines, the munition has enabled Russia to conduct numerous strikes in cities across Ukraine in recent weeks while conserving its dwindling missile stock.\n\nThe Shahed-136 has helped Russia damage around 40 percent of Ukraine\u2019s electricity infrastructure, affecting half the country\u2019s nonnuclear power generation capacity, a Ukrainian lawmaker said this week. Massive blackouts and energy rationing have ensued. With winter approaching, Moscow likely hopes this campaign of terror will erode Ukraine\u2019s will to fight.\n\nBoth Iranian and U.S.-allied officials now say Tehran will soon provide Moscow not only with more Shahed-136s and other drones but also Fateh-110 and Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles\u2014another escalation of Iranian support for Russia\u2019s war. These single-stage, solid-propellant, road-mobile ballistic missiles are among the most precise in Iran\u2019s ballistic missile arsenal, which is the largest in the Middle East. The Fateh-110 is older and has a reported range of 250 to 300 kilometers (or roughly 150 to 190 miles), whereas the Zulfiqar was unveiled in 2016 as an upgrade of the Fateh-110 with a reported 700-kilometer (435-mile) range.\n\nFor the first time, Iran is involved in a major war on the European continent.\n\nIran has employed variants of these missiles in numerous military operations over the past half decade, including in strikes on U.S. positions in Iraq in January 2020 that caused more than 100 traumatic brain injuries among U.S. service members. Although Iran has proliferated variants of these weapons to its proxies in the Middle East, the regime has never before brought them to Eastern Europe. Like the Shahed-136 drone, these missiles will help Moscow conserve its remaining Iskander short-range ballistic missiles and other missiles, which Russia has used increasingly sparingly as the war drags on.\n\nThat Tehran and Moscow would cooperate this closely in Ukraine caught many observers\u2014including some leading Russian experts on Iran\u2014by surprise. Despite their recent alignment, Iran and Russia have a long history of enmity and mistrust going back to the tsarist era, including a series of Russo-Persian wars and frequent Russian meddling in Persian politics. During the Cold War, their relations were tense when Iran was led by the U.S.-allied shah and still worse after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iran\u2019s new regime dubbed the Soviet Union a \u201cSatan\u201d alongside the United States and backed the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets, just as Moscow aided Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq War. Relations later improved, with Russia providing assistance to Iran\u2019s growing nuclear infrastructure and missile programs in the 1990s. But Moscow also earned Iranian mistrust when it waffled on major arms deals and assented to multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions sanctioning Iran over its growing nuclear program.\n\nRusso-Iranian relations have gained steam, however, since Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2012 return to the Russian presidency\u2014and particularly since his 2015 military intervention in Syria to save their common ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Although suspicion and competition remain, both sides increasingly see their interests as intertwined, driven by shared opposition to the West. A formal alliance isn\u2019t forthcoming, but that won\u2019t stop Russia and Iran\u2014along with China\u2014from deepening their entente.\n\nSince its disastrous invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has doubled down on its partnership with Tehran, including their joint efforts to counter Western sanctions. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, meanwhile, has instructed his underlings to develop stronger relations with Russia and China. With the Kremlin\u2019s support, Iran was granted full membership in the Chinese- and Russian-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization last year. Tehran is also seeking membership in the so-called BRICS group and is currently negotiating a permanent free trade agreement with the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union.\n\nViewed in this context, a deal to supply Russia with drones, missiles, and military advisors makes strategic sense for Iran and can demonstrate the latter\u2019s value to one of its two senior partners in the anti-Western entente. The deal also raises the question of what Iran may receive in return. Advanced Russian fighter aircraft or the S-400 air defense system, which Moscow has previously declined to sell to Tehran, could now be offered. (Assistance to Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program will probably remain a bridge too far for Russia, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s warning to the contrary.)\n\nMeanwhile, Iran will gain an extensive testing ground for its latest drone and missile platforms, including against Western-made air defense systems and other weaponry. Tehran is sure to apply lessons learned from the Ukrainian theater to future weapons development and tactics back in the Middle East.\n\nBut for Iran\u2019s rulers, supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is also an expansion of their own offensive against the West. For decades, Iran has sought to extend its influence and weaken its rivals by supplying weaponry\u2014including some of the same drones and missiles it has provided Russia\u2014to Middle Eastern militant groups, such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. Now, Tehran is, in effect, applying the same arms proliferation strategy to Europe.",

Tehran is sure to apply lessons learned from the Ukrainian theater to future weapons development and tactics back in the Middle East.</p>\n\n<p>But for Iran\u2019s rulers, supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is also an expansion of their own offensive against the West. For decades, Iran has sought to extend its influence and weaken its rivals by supplying weaponry\u2014including some of the same drones and missiles it has provided Russia\u2014to Middle Eastern militant groups, such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. Now, Tehran is, in effect, applying the same arms proliferation strategy to Europe.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "By fueling the crisis in Ukraine, Iran likely hopes to lead the United States to continue diverting its attention from the Middle East. Under three successive presidents, Washington has signaled it would prefer to largely divest from the region to shift military resources elsewhere and focus attention on problems at home. Now that Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine is absorbing Western attention and resources, Tehran sees an opportunity to feed this trend.\n\nInstead, Washington should make clear that Iran\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war will only invite stronger U.S. resolve in the Middle East. Particularly as protests continue to rage across Iran, now would be a good time for the Biden administration to revise its Iran policy to focus on rolling back Iranian influence in the region. U.S. condemnations and sanctions are welcome but will achieve little if not part of a larger strategy.\n\nIronically, Tehran\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine could prompt the West to pay more, not less, attention to the Middle East, especially if Europe now embraces a tougher line toward Iran. Britain and the European Union followed in Washington\u2019s footsteps last week and levied targeted sanctions against elements of Iran\u2019s drone program, building on similar recent trans-Atlantic sanctions against Tehran\u2019s morality police. As the Iranian threat to Europe grows closer, Washington should not miss this opportunity to better align trans-Atlantic policies on Iran.\n\nThe United States should also enlist more support against Moscow from Israel and the Persian Gulf states by pointing to Russia\u2019s deepening ties with Iran. To be sure, Tehran\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine doesn\u2019t immediately change the Israeli or Arab Gulf calculus on Russia. Jerusalem, for example, remains unwilling to grant Kyiv\u2019s requests for air defense systems, and the Emiratis don\u2019t appear keen to crack down on Russian money flocking to their country to avoid Western sanctions. But U.S. allies in the region could change their tune if Russia starts selling advanced weapons to Iran (which is partly why Moscow has previously refrained from doing so).\n\nAt the same time, the United States should work to ensure that its Israeli and Arab allies, who have for years lived on the front lines of the Iranian drone and missile threat, have the military capabilities and support they need to counter Iran\u2019s aggression. Washington should also redouble its efforts to encourage and facilitate Arab-Israeli security cooperation. In addition to helping counter Iran, strong U.S. support for its Middle Eastern allies may, in turn, make them more open to U.S. requests regarding Russia.\n\nFinally, Iran\u2019s actions in Ukraine also give the Biden administration and its European partners yet another reason to abandon their quest to resurrect its 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran. In addition to failing to contain Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions, a deal would enable further Russo-Iranian cooperation on civilian nuclear projects and sanctions evasion while offering Tehran the funds it needs to procure advanced conventional weaponry from Russia and elsewhere.\n\n-------------\n\nBy **John Hardie,** the deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, and **Behnam Ben Taleblu**, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",

Serhiy, a Ukrainian drone pilot who watched as his weapon buzzed into a Russian-controlled village and picked off the armored vehicle, a blast that was audible seconds later at his position about four miles away.\n\n>\u201cWe used to cheer, we used to shout, \u2018Hurray!\u2019 but we\u2019re used to it now,\u201d he said.\n\n>The war in Ukraine has been fought primarily through the air, with artillery, rockets, missiles and drones. And for months, Russia had the upper hand, able to lob munitions at Ukrainian cities, towns and military targets from positions well beyond the reach of Ukrainian weapons.\n\n>But in recent months, the tide has turned along the front lines in southern Ukraine. With powerful Western weapons and deadly homemade drones, Ukraine now has artillery superiority in the area, commanders and military analysts say.\n\n>Ukraine now has an edge in both range and in precision-guided rockets and artillery shells, a class of weapons largely lacking in Russia\u2019s arsenal. Ukrainian soldiers are taking out armored vehicles worth millions of dollars with cheap homemade drones, as well as with more advanced drones and other weapons provided by the United States and allies.\n\n>The Russian military remains a formidable force, with cruise missiles, a sizable army and millions of rounds of artillery shells, albeit imprecise ones. It has just completed a mobilization effort that will add 300,000 troops to the battlefield, Russian commanders say, though many of those will be ill trained and ill equipped. And President Vladimir V. Putin has made clear his determination to win the war at almost any cost.\n\n>Still, there is no mistaking the shifting fortunes on the southern front.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s growing advantage in artillery, a stark contrast to fighting throughout the country over the summer when Russia pummeled Ukrainian positions with mortar and artillery fire, has allowed slow if costly progress in the south toward the strategic port city of Kherson, the only provincial capital that Russia managed to occupy after invading in February.\n\n>The new capabilities were on display in the predawn hours Saturday when Ukrainian drones hit a Russian vessel docked in the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s home port of Sevastopol, deep in the occupied territory of Crimea, once thought an impregnable bastion.\n\n>The contrast with the battlefield over the summer could not be starker. In the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Russia fired roughly 10 artillery rounds for each answering shell from Ukrainian batteries. In Kherson now, Ukrainian commanders say the sides are firing about equal numbers of shells, but Ukraine\u2019s strikes are not only longer range but more precise because of the satellite-guided rockets and artillery rounds provided by the West.\n\n>\u201cWe can reach them and they cannot reach us,\u201d said Maj. Oleksandr, the commander of an artillery battery on the Kherson front, who like others interviewed for this article gave only his first name for security reasons. \u201cThey don\u2019t have these weapons.\u201d\n\n>Falling rates of Russian fire also speak to ammunition shortages, he said. \u201cThere is an idea the Russian army is infinite, but it is a myth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intensity of fire has fallen by three times. It\u2019s realistic to fight them.\u201d\n\n>A main highway approaching Kherson city from the west has become a thoroughfare for Ukrainian artillery, with towed howitzers, truck-mounted howitzers and trucks laden with grad rockets rumbling by continually through the day.\n\n>American-provided M777 howitzers firing precision-guided shells and striking up to 20 miles behind Russian lines have forced the Russians to stage heavy equipment farther from the front. Ukrainian drones spot infantry but fewer tanks or armored vehicles near the front line, said First Lt. Oleh, the commander of a unit flying reconnaissance drones. \u201cWe hear a lot of rumors they are abandoning the first lines of defense.\u201d\n\n>This firepower has tipped the balance in the south, raising expectations that a long-anticipated assault on Kherson is drawing near \u2014 though a swirl of apparent misdirection from military leaders on both sides has clouded the picture.\n\n>The terrain around the city \u2014 table-flat steppe with thin tree lines and little cover, and crisscrossed by irrigation canals that can be used as trenches \u2014 favors its Russian defenders. And Ukrainian commanders and officials have been dropping hints of an impending attack since the spring, only to have the fighting drag on.\n\n>But the city lies on the west bank of the Dnipro River, making its defenders reliant on bridges to Russian territory on the eastern bank that now lie within easy range of Ukrainian rocket artillery and, for the most part, are now unusable. That has made the Russian grip precarious. But President Putin has reportedly overruled his generals\u2019 recommendations of a retreat to safer and more easily defended ground on the east bank.\n\n>The question remains just how long the Russian forces can, or will, hold out in Kherson.\n\n>\u201cRussia is unable to maintain logistics supplies\u201d to the west bank of the Dnipro, said Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst and the director of Rochan Consulting, based in Gdansk, Poland. He added that the Ukrainian military\u2019s claim to have achieved the upper hand in artillery and frontline drone strikes in the south was \u201chighly plausible.\u201d\n\n>After a recent Ukrainian assault using American M777 howitzers and High Mobility Artillery Rockets, Slovak Zuzana self-propelled artillery and Polish Krab self-propelled artillery, Mr. Muzyka said, citing Ukrainian military sources, heavily battered Russian artillery positions on one section of the Kherson front went silent for more than 48 hours.\n\n>A recent drone attack led by Lieutenant Serhiy provided another example of the Russian forces\u2019 vulnerabilities.\n\n>Equipped with night-vison goggles \u2014 an essential item of modern warfare that the Russian forces generally lack \u2014 the soldiers drove to the front line in an SUV with the headlights off, passing the jagged ruins of houses in a destroyed village silhouetted by a thin sliver of the moon.\n\n>Rattling under the driver\u2019s seat were eight small bombs, each packed with a pound and a half of high explosives, enough to obliterate an armored vehicle. In the rear storage area sat a high-end, commercially available drone.\n\n>From a rooftop position, two former computer programmers turned tank hunters directed drone strikes that took out two Russian armored vehicles in the space of about three hours, destroying more than a million dollars of Russian weaponry with a weapon that cost about $20,000.\n\n>After each flight, the drone buzzed back a few minutes later, unscathed.\n\n>This drone system, called Perun, one of dozens used by the Ukrainian military, swoops in at an altitude of about 500 feet, hovers directly over a target and releases its bombs.\n\n>The drones are audible from the ground but still effective, Lieutenant Serhiy said, as the Russian forces \u201cdon\u2019t have much time\u201d to shoot them down. It cannot be flown in all weather, and sometimes misses. \u201cThe technology is not perfect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it works when it works.\u201d\n\n>Farther from the front line, out of drone range, American-provided, satellite-guided artillery shells have forced the Russian military to carefully camouflage or pull back heavy equipment, said Lieutenant Oleh, the commander of a drone surveillance unit.\n\n>\u201cRussia\u2019s advantage was only one thing: quantity,\u201d Lieutenant Oleh said in an interview at his base, a house along a muddy lane in a village. The inside was crammed with screens, laptops, cables and batteries. A strip of flypaper dangled from the ceiling.\n\n>Sitting in front of his screens, he pinpoints tanks, barracks or other military objects and relays coordinates to artillery teams firing satellite guided shells, which hit within a yard or two of their intended targets.\n\n>\u201cFrom a typical howitzer, you create a sniper rifle,\u201d he said of the combination of drone surveillance and satellite guided artillery shells, something Russia lacks. \u201cOne shot, one kill.\u201d\n\n>The partial destruction of bridges over the broad Dnipro River through the summer slowed Russia\u2019s movement of heavy equipment to the river\u2019s western bank, even as Western weaponry helped Ukraine whittle away at what was already there. The combination cost Russia its artillery advantage on the river\u2019s western bank.\n\n\nWould just like to say, there was a person back in late June early July that had called much of this, and I\u2019ve spent the past hour searching for who it was, rereading a lot of garbage hot takes in the process (including mine.) Would love for that person to come forward.",

Look at this [ Donbas FIRMS map from August 26th](https://github.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/commit/ee3caddb129e1ca7b99860d11986cf5e9f6543b5#diff-c631ef7cd3ecc52d79455a86329ff48b9b64bc209dd1ab49fd0dadc1f3aa6d03), with Henry Schlottman\u2019s tracking of Russian BTGs. There is a clear correlation with heavy IR wattage output up and down the front line. This is how intense Russian artillery was then - 6 to 8 weeks after the introduction of HIMARS. \n\nThe flatline we see starting the first week of September correlates not to HIMARS, but to the Kharkiv counteroffensive which started on [09/06/2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Ukrainian_eastern_counteroffensive). This appears to have fatally undermined Russia\u2019s military in a profound way. I don\u2019t know how - I\u2019m a scientist and don\u2019t have any military experience. But the data could not be clearer - the silencing of Russian artillery is far more pronounced after the counteroffensive than HIMARS. I don\u2019t say this to undermine the crucial importance of HIMARS - I doubt we see any counteroffensive without it. But I\u2019m worried people might learn the wrong lessons by conflating the fatal blow to Russian artillery with one system as opposed to a carefully executed battlefield maneuver. \n\nThat said, the other possibility is that the counteroffensive was a brutal wake up call to Russian leadership who shifted to conserving artillery shells for when they may be strategically/tactically significant. I can\u2019t imagine generating that much IR wattage was cheap - the Hiroshima detonation was the equivalent to 17,400 MW, so at it\u2019s peak Russia was expending that kind of energy via 152 mm and 155mm rounds each week in just the Donbas. Though note that watts is a energy by intensity conversion, and IR is far lower energy than the gamma and X-ray radiation produced by a nuke.

Your entire premise is they&#39;d rather lose the war to stop the bombing campaign versus use the weaponry they possess already that&#39;s LITERALLY designed to stop it from happening.</p>\n\n<p>FFS, every country who have developed nuclear weapons did so to stop from happening exactly what you&#39;re recommending. </p>\n\n<p>The whole reason the Russians can do it to Ukraine in the first place is because they didn&#39;t possess the specific strategic weapons that could stop it from happening, nor are they bound allies to those who do possess them (NATO).</p>\n\n<p>If Ukraine really wants to protect itself, as soon as the Russians are pushed out of Ukraine proper, the next day they join NATO or make an independent alliance with a nuclear power which guarantees their safety from further attacks. At that point Russia doesn&#39;t just have to worry about war with Ukraine because then it means war with the partners in the alliance, who are nuclear powers. </p>\n\n<p>Which was exactly what russia feared and why they invaded ukraine to begin with.</p>\n</div>",

Maybe there would be a block of Eastern European countries who'd be on board? It could make invoking Article 5 difficult if Russian attacks are due to those countries' actions in Ukraine and may even be privately discouraged by the US. NATO members are required to avoid non-Article 5 operation that risks escalating into an Article 5 commitment, so  an Eastern European alliance may only be on paper.

There&#39;s also the economic ties/pressure Russia can put on Turkey, Erdo\u011fan&#39;s need for support by anti-Westerners, etc. that may be more practically important, but many of those factors are at least partially downstream of deep cultural reasons. </p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is Turkey has made considerable effort not to antagonize Russia when they invaded Ukraine. What makes you think Turkey would go to war if Russia invades Ukraine again?</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "CITeam report out. Some interesting bits. Refer the original for links and translation errors. \n\n\n[Summary for October 28-29 (until 13:00)](https://notes.citeam.org/ru-dispatch-oct-28-29)\n\n>Mobilization news\n\n>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported on the implementation of the partial mobilization plan at a meeting with Vladimir Putin. He said that at the initial stage there were problems with the supply of different types of allowances, but now all these problems have been solved. Separately, Shoigu noted that special attention is paid to the training of those called up from the reserve. Currently, 218,000 people are improving their training, and 82 thousand people are already on the front line.\n\n>The dispatch of citizens called up for mobilization was completed on October 28. According to Shoigu's report, the notification of citizens has been stopped. No additional mobilization tasks are planned. (It is important that Putin's decree on the end of partial mobilization did not follow). The Federation Council stated that a decree on the end of \"partial\" mobilization is not required.\n\n>Military commissariats within the framework of the \"special military operation\" will continue to recruit troops only by accepting volunteers and candidates for military service under contract.\n\n>The press service of the Western Military District said that the mobilization continues in the same mode, it was declared by presidential decree and only by presidential decree can be stopped. Later, they supplemented this statement, saying that the main partial mobilization activities in St. Petersburg were suspended.\n\n\n>In Kuibyshev, Novosibirsk region, mobilized citizens were released from the military registration and enlistment office home because of receiving some order.\n\n\n>Telegram channel \"MOBILIZATION\" analyzed reports of the death of mobilized residents of the Sverdlovsk region. The lifespan of those mobilized from the moment of receipt of the summons was from 7 to 20 days.\n\n\n>A mobilized person from the Bryansk region was sent to the front line in Kreminnaya, although officially on papers he is listed as undergoing military training in the Voronezh region. He managed to contact his relatives and report that Kremennaya was surrounded, and they had nowhere to retreat. 10 of their unit survived.\n\n\n>A cage appeared at the collection point for mobilized residents of Tatarstan at Kazan Expo. Judging by the pictures, there are people inside the cage, there are bedding on the floor. What it was and why it was needed is unknown. The Inkazan telegram channel sent a request to the military commissariat of the republic.\n\n\n>Artist Pavel Ustinov, who was once convicted in a Moscow case, was mobilized. Based on his words, it can be concluded that he goes to the SVO voluntarily.\n\n\n>The defendant was mobilized in Buryatia. He is accused of attempted murder and robbery, and is also registered with a psychiatrist. The court did not grant the prosecutor's request for detention, sent him under recognizance not to leave and suspended criminal proceedings.\n\n\n>According to the founder of the resource \"Gulagu.net\" Vladimir Osechkin, Russian courts were instructed not to let prisoners go on parole. The instruction on the refusal of parole is due to the shortage of workers in the industrial zones of the colonies, which arose due to the recruitment of prisoners by the head of the group Wagner Prigozhin and representatives of the Ministry of Defense of Russia.\n\n\n>Pavel Gubarev, who was previously one of the leaders of Novorossiya and served as the head of the mobilization department of the DPR, describes how formally the training of those mobilized at the training grounds is carried out.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>CITeam report out. Some interesting bits. Refer the original for links and translation errors. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://notes.citeam.org/ru-dispatch-oct-28-29\">Summary for October 28-29 (until 13:00)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mobilization news</p>\n\n<p>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported on the implementation of the partial mobilization plan at a meeting with Vladimir Putin. He said that at the initial stage there were problems with the supply of different types of allowances, but now all these problems have been solved. Separately, Shoigu noted that special attention is paid to the training of those called up from the reserve. Currently, 218,000 people are improving their training, and 82 thousand people are already on the front line.</p>\n\n<p>The dispatch of citizens called up for mobilization was completed on October 28. According to Shoigu&#39;s report, the notification of citizens has been stopped. No additional mobilization tasks are planned. (It is important that Putin&#39;s decree on the end of partial mobilization did not follow). The Federation Council stated that a decree on the end of &quot;partial&quot; mobilization is not required.</p>\n\n<p>Military commissariats within the framework of the &quot;special military operation&quot; will continue to recruit troops only by accepting volunteers and candidates for military service under contract.</p>\n\n<p>The press service of the Western Military District said that the mobilization continues in the same mode, it was declared by presidential decree and only by presidential decree can be stopped. Later, they supplemented this statement, saying that the main partial mobilization activities in St. Petersburg were suspended.</p>\n\n<p>In Kuibyshev, Novosibirsk region, mobilized citizens were released from the military registration and enlistment office home because of receiving some order.</p>\n\n<p>Telegram channel &quot;MOBILIZATION&quot; analyzed reports of the death of mobilized residents of the Sverdlovsk region. The lifespan of those mobilized from the moment of receipt of the summons was from 7 to 20 days.</p>\n\n<p>A mobilized person from the Bryansk region was sent to the front line in Kreminnaya, although officially on papers he is listed as undergoing military training in the Voronezh region. He managed to contact his relatives and report that Kremennaya was surrounded, and they had nowhere to retreat. 10 of their unit survived.</p>\n\n<p>A cage appeared at the collection point for mobilized residents of Tatarstan at Kazan Expo. Judging by the pictures, there are people inside the cage, there are bedding on the floor. What it was and why it was needed is unknown. The Inkazan telegram channel sent a request to the military commissariat of the republic.</p>\n\n<p>Artist Pavel Ustinov, who was once convicted in a Moscow case, was mobilized. Based on his words, it can be concluded that he goes to the SVO voluntarily.</p>\n\n<p>The defendant was mobilized in Buryatia. He is accused of attempted murder and robbery, and is also registered with a psychiatrist. The court did not grant the prosecutor&#39;s request for detention, sent him under recognizance not to leave and suspended criminal proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>According to the founder of the resource &quot;Gulagu.net&quot; Vladimir Osechkin, Russian courts were instructed not to let prisoners go on parole. The instruction on the refusal of parole is due to the shortage of workers in the industrial zones of the colonies, which arose due to the recruitment of prisoners by the head of the group Wagner Prigozhin and representatives of the Ministry of Defense of Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Pavel Gubarev, who was previously one of the leaders of Novorossiya and served as the head of the mobilization department of the DPR, describes how formally the training of those mobilized at the training grounds is carried out. According to him, it looks more like a show: no one is normally trained and there is no combat matching. He also said that Russian militaristic organizations such as Rokot decided to correct this situation and launched initial military training courses - NVP from Rokot. They will include the basics of tactics, weapons possession, first aid and communication.</p>\n\n<p>Svetlana Babayeva, head of the &quot;Russia Today&quot; division in Simferopol, died at the training ground in Crimea, the details have not yet been disclosed.</p>\n\n<p>Exactly a year ago (October 28-29, 2021), we and other analysts began to notice the movements of Russian troops and began work to cover the current invasion.</p>\n\n<p>The situation on the front line\nIn the Svatov-Lisichansk direction, the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled Russian attacks near the settlements of Andreevka and Belogorovka.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian special forces &quot;Kedar&quot; shows trophies and captured prisoners in the village of Nevskoye.</p>\n\n<p>Semyon Pegov and his colleagues (WarGonzo project) report that Ukrainian forces continue to attack in the direction of Peschany.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, analyst Def Mon concludes that it is likely that the line of Ukrainian control passes to the east than he depicts on the map.
