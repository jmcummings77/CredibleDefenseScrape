Modern tanks are too large and too heavy to build on civilian automotive assembly lines.\n\nEven back then, most tanks were either built in dedicated factories or factories retooled from tractor/heavy vehicle or locomotive production. Car factories usually built other things.\n\nShell factories were almost universally new-built instead of converted.\n\n>a modern Lada is vastly bigger, heavier, and more complicated than the Model-Ts that the US automotive industry was building back in 1939.\n\nThis is 1 ton vs. 2.5 tons.

I argued that Ukraine had set high expectations, with everyone closely watching: the West, Russia, and especially the Ukrainian people, who are particularly demanding of their government. Unlike in 2013, when the government could deflect and distract, the success of the past year (2022) has raised the stakes. Now, the entire nation is holding its breath for the counteroffensive, seeing it as pivotal. The government's ability to manage expectations and deliver on promises is critical. Failure could lead to a significant disillusionment among Ukrainians, who are not easily swayed by mere damage control or excuses. This situation presents a monumental test for Ukraine's leadership, as the country cannot afford the repercussions of a failed counteroffensive.\n\nBy November, it was apparent that Ukraine's military efforts were waning, with the counteroffensive unofficially ending and Russia maintaining its strength. Despite Ukraine having access to a wide array of Western weapon systems, the real concern shifted towards the sustainability of its manpower (an Issue also known as far back as January 2022) and the growing issue of war fatigue. The dwindling pool of recruitable individuals highlighted a critical and undeniable strain on Ukraine's resources.\n\nEuropean support, while robust, showed its limits, and American aid unclear. These factors, together with the eroding morale and manpower, pointed to a deepening crisis. By then, the situation had become less clear than in April, with few anticipating a negative turn for Ukraine. Yet, I considered it a real possibility, noting the absence of significant territorial gains and foreseeing minimal change on the battlefield.\n\nIndeed, by now with Advika's fall and the definitive end of Ukraine's counteroffensive, the reality has set in. The territorial changes have been minimal, with few surprises beyond Ukraine's drone campaign. This outcome aligns with my earlier caution on the imperative of the counteroffensive's success or at least a perception thereof.\n\nI've summarized my previous observations to highlight the importance of the counteroffensive and its potential political impacts, as I've discussed in forums like this one. While not all my predictions, such as expecting a renewed Russian winter campaign, have been accurate, it seemed apparent that political and public support for Zelensky could wane without a successful offensive. Zelensky's portrayal of last year's Black Sea operations as a significant victory demonstrates attempts to sustain a positive outlook amid difficult circumstances.\n\nEssentially, although various factors contribute, including corruption, nothing would have mattered if Ukraine had continued to demonstrate success on the battlefield. I believe the critical aspect was not the counteroffensive itself, but rather its publicity. Even in April of last year, most domestic issues were overlooked because the government was focused on the counteroffensive.

I find it likely that they will try to expand as much as possible their control over the eastern bank of the canal, which passes right along the heights that are the watershed between the Kryvyi/Kazennyi Torets and the Bakhmutovka basins.

[...]</p>\n\n<p>The IDF says the findings of the investigation show that the incident &quot;could have been prevented, and at the same time, <strong>those who approved the attack were convinced that they were attacking armed Hamas operatives</strong> and not WCK members.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They identified one armed person in the warehouse. They &quot;believed&quot; there to be a second gunman in the general vicinity of the warehouse - weird and vague phrasing. They had low confidence that these - now - two gunmen were part of the convoy, but they then proceed to missile strike three cars.</p>\n\n<p>They also do not address the logos on top of WCK&#39;s cars, Bellingcat came to the conclusion that they would&#39;ve likely been visible.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/02/strike-that-killed-world-central-kitchen-workers-bears-hallmarks-of-israeli-precision-strike/\">https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/02/strike-that-killed-world-central-kitchen-workers-bears-hallmarks-of-israeli-precision-strike/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is notable because at least one of the vehicles clearly bears the logo of World Central Kitchen on the roof.  <strong>It is likely these markings would have been visible from above when the strike was carried out</strong>, although this depends on the capability of the optic used to track the vehicle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m skeptical for now. To my knowledge the IDF hasn&#39;t been a very <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Rouzan_al-Najjar\">reliable narrator</a> in the past. Anybody with any insight into how trustworthy and independent this investigation is?</p>\n</div>",

The US can&#39;t change that.</p>\n\n<p>Some say that increased production will increase demand, but there&#39;s little to show for it. When the US increased oil production, OPEC did corresponding cuts. Despite the price going up and down, demand has been surprisingly inelastic. And now the US doesn&#39;t want Ukraine to hurt Russia&#39;s hydrocarbon exports. Why not export more instead?</p>\n</div>",

They are maxed out where if you sign the papers today your order will be on the dock 2026 at the earliest if not 2027.  The reasonable YoY increase is maybe 5% if that.

If all you need is a flimsy &quot;we thought they talked to someone from Hamas&quot; with a low confidence rating, it seems like a system ripe for abuse where individual commanders might deliberately target aid workers even if it&#39;s not the policy of the IDF. Similar to the above, turning a blind eye to such events (or not bothering to seriously question whether or not they happen) is a form of tacit approval.</p>\n\n<p>So long as Israel has its current government, these events will be seen through the lense of the public statements of its most radical members. When people calling for active genocide against the Palestinian people keep their jobs in government, those statements will hang over ever aid worker death caused by the IDF. The way you separate the two is with open and transparent ROE that demonstrate clearly and without question that such statements aren&#39;t the policy of the IDF.</p>\n</div>",

With AI you can&#39;t have that.</p>\n\n<p>However, military environments have one advantage in terms of AI use: After the bomb explodes, it is often easy to verify who was killed, whether they were combatants or civilians (or some of both). So if you have a large enough sample of military attacks based on AI, you can calculate whether the AI was right 50% or 90% or 99.9% of the time. You still don&#39;t know how the AI reached its conclusions, but presumably what we really care about is the human results rather than the algorithm. If anyone chose to rely on an AI knowing that it had a bad accuracy rate, responsibility would lie with them.</p>\n</div>",

You're conflating officer corps based on hopeful numbers reported in 2011 (which they didn't even meet) for the entire Armed Forces, so every branch, active and reserve. \n\nThe Russian Navy and VKS have crazy high officer to enlisted ratio because officers are the only ones properly trained, especially as legitimate technical subject matter experts. The Russian ground forces and VDV, MP, and Spetsnaz have the smallest ratio, despite them still over relying on their junior officers for responsibilities that in any other military would be performed by junior NCOs.\n\nTo make that system work, the Russians ONLY commissioned junior lieutenants after attending a 4-5 year long service academy that was MOS specific, so they learn not only about the science of warfare (the Russians and Soviets before them think they cracked the code that war is totally formulaic, an equation they can solve), learning about leadership and all that stuff too, but also getting a HIGHLY in-depth technical education on all equipment used in their branch, as they are the repository of knowledge in all small units.\n\nGuess what happens to that system when they take ridiculously heavy casualties not to mention refuseniks and all the rest? To make numbers they early graduate everyone in the academies regardless of their knowledge, they battlefield commission promising but undertrained enlisted troops, or they use veteran officers who they try to woo discharged officers and then shove them into command and staff roles as needed regardless of their past experiences or training.\n\nThis is especially problematic for the field grade officer corps in the Russian military. They didn't have an Up or Out style promotion system, so that deliberately allowed officers to serve longer in ranks and positions than most Western militaries, so a \"successful\" company, battalion, brigade/regimental commander might serve in that role for 5-7 years at a time. That was helped with a zany pay system where they got paid more in command roles. Additionally, the Russians had a very stratified officer corps where from major onwards they typically went on either command career tracks or staff career tracks. \n\nAll of that has the pro that it can create lots of true subject matter experts who are right where they need to be, professionally. But the biggest con to that type of system is that it CANNOT take losses, any attrition and it breaks. That's what the Russians are experiencing now, they've taken huge losses to their combat arms company grade officer ranks (junior lieutenant to captain) and devastating ranks to their field grade officer corps (major to colonel) especially earlier in the war where they were routinely leading from the front and being deliberately targeted by the Ukrainians. Now they make up for losses and grow exponentially with more units by taking anyone with a pulse and making them combat arms officers in command and staff roles they are totally unfit for.\n\nThe Ukrainians are doing the same thing in all regards, they not only had a very similar institutional culture and system as the Russians due to their shared Soviet history, but they elected to make the same ruthless personnel decisions to emphasize quantity over quality. Unfortunately for the both (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), they both suck so their decision to sacrifice quantity isn't too detrimental because their enemy also sucks.\n\nThis is why both sides struggle so much at the tactical level, why their command and staff can barely make a bowl of cereal without turning it into a mass casualty event. They suck, hugely. And it was all a deliberate decision because they focused on maintaining an impossible OPTEMPO because both political leaders in this war made impossible demands on their armies, forcing them to focus so much on maintaining for the next 1-2 months and never actually contemplating what happens next year.\n\nFor the Ukrainians, that is breaking their system. For the Russians, they're winning purely through numbers, but only because they're fighting someone as bad as they are.",
