Of those that arrived in the country, two are functional.\n\n>CSAT did not specify whether Ukraine will receive one of the operationalized systems.\n\nThis is also coming as the US has [paused all Patriot interceptor deliveries to countries besides Ukraine](https://www.ft.com/content/89fe9d6b-3a0f-42a5-af50-cff7f457a126).\n\n>Three people with knowledge of the decision said the move would be announced on Thursday, after President Joe Biden said last week in Italy that he had secured commitments for the delivery of additional air defence systems to Ukraine. These would include Patriot missile batteries for which Kyiv has been clamouring after Russia escalated missile and drone attacks on its power plants.\n\n>Biden said five countries had agreed to send Patriot and other air defence systems to Ukraine, and that other countries expecting the delivery of the US systems would have to wait because \u201ceverything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met\u201d.\n\n~~It's unclear how long this will last, but in my eyes it can't last too long because the US has contracts (which actually make money) to fulfill. At the same time, Ukraine's needs for missiles are vast and they are actually getting shot at.

North Korea perfecting ICBMs with the help of Russia will legitimately threaten US mainland which could weaken that US nuclear umbrella.  Would US really risk NY/LA/SF for Seoul as the saying goes.

Big-name Israeli combat operations tend to be swift, devastating, and one-sided, and also tend not to be full-blown wars, with the notable exception of 1967.</p>\n\n<p>But then again, the main Arab strategy seems to focus on PR gains that make little sense to people who value life.</p>\n</div>",

Hezbollah is reported to have 30,000 missiles that can reach to the Tel Aviv area or further south (where most Israelis live). A large fraction of the population of northern Israel will likely evacuate further south. So I expect the death toll from Hezbollah missiles to be small by the standards of the current war. Dozens of deaths would not surprise me at all. But not thousands.\n\nPrecision missiles that strike infrastructure are more of an issue, but 1) Iron Dome and other systems are designed to intercept them, 2) such missiles are large and hard to hide and may be destroyed by Israel in storage or while preparing to launch, 3) precision guiding may not work in the presence of GPS jamming, 4) destroyed infrastructure can be worked around, and replaced or rebuilt during or after the war. So (with lower confidence) I do not expect Hezbollah precision missiles to be a major factor in the war either.\n\n> And with regard to decapitation strikes: what's to stop Nasrallah and co. from hiding and constantly relocating like Hamas leadership has been doing?\n\nThey can and will. They will have fewer human shields to hide behind than Hamas does (and no Israeli hostages to shield them - which may be the reason Hamas leadership is still alive). It is questionable whether Israel will manage to kill any particular Hezbollah leader.

That long-held view hinges on China using ever more of the cleaner-burning fuel as a bridge between dirty coal and the renewable energy that will deliver net zero by 2060.\n\n\n>But the realities on the ground are changing. China looks like it\u2019s ahead of schedule on emissions, which may have peaked more than half a decade ahead of its 2030 target. It\u2019s also subsidizing overcapacity in coal power as a backstop to intermittent wind and solar, a strategy that essentially skips using gas as a transitional fuel.\n\n\n>...\n\n\n>If it gets off the ground, Russia\u2019s proposed pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2, would help reduce China\u2019s additional LNG requirements through 2030 by nearly 20%, according to BNEF. Even though China has invested a lot in terminals to receive LNG, relying on the uncertainties of the international market for supply is probably a less attractive option for a government that has energy security as one of its top priorities.\n\n\n>...\n\n\n>China\u2019s thermal power investment, primarily in new coal plants, climbed 15% last year, even as usage is shrinking. In May, the country saw electricity generation from hydroelectric dams and solar farms jump 39% and 29% respectively.\n\n\nFor a long time, Western analysts have believed that China will use gas as a transition fuel, and invested accordingly. Now it's increasingly likely that this won't happen. China has invested billions in [coal peakers](https://www.swiftcentre.org/publicforecasts/global-coal-consumption-will-defy-expectations), and even more in solar and batteries. And China might not be an exception:\n\n\n>Overall, the situation is even clearer in the case of India, as it both its economy and population are growing more quickly, and because it is not yet wealthy enough to afford to decarbonise.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>National security continues to guide energy preferences:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-19/china-s-lng-boom-threatened-by-growing-menu-of-alternative-fuels\">China\u2019s LNG Boom Threatened by Growing Menu of Alternative Fuels</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Global majors like Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE have invested billions of dollars in new seaborne gas supply, wagering that consumption in the world\u2019s biggest importer will continue to expand rapidly. That long-held view hinges on China using ever more of the cleaner-burning fuel as a bridge between dirty coal and the renewable energy that will deliver net zero by 2060.</p>\n\n<p>But the realities on the ground are changing. China looks like it\u2019s ahead of schedule on emissions, which may have peaked more than half a decade ahead of its 2030 target. It\u2019s also subsidizing overcapacity in coal power as a backstop to intermittent wind and solar, a strategy that essentially skips using gas as a transitional fuel.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>If it gets off the ground, Russia\u2019s proposed pipeline, the Power of Siberia 2, would help reduce China\u2019s additional LNG requirements through 2030 by nearly 20%, according to BNEF. Even though China has invested a lot in terminals to receive LNG, relying on the uncertainties of the international market for supply is probably a less attractive option for a government that has energy security as one of its top priorities.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s thermal power investment, primarily in new coal plants, climbed 15% last year, even as usage is shrinking. In May, the country saw electricity generation from hydroelectric dams and solar farms jump 39% and 29% respectively.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a long time, Western analysts have believed that China will use gas as a transition fuel, and invested accordingly. Now it&#39;s increasingly likely that this won&#39;t happen. China has invested billions in <a href=\"https://www.swiftcentre.org/publicforecasts/global-coal-consumption-will-defy-expectations\">coal peakers</a>, and even more in solar and batteries. And China might not be an exception:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Overall, the situation is even clearer in the case of India, as it both its economy and population are growing more quickly, and because it is not yet wealthy enough to afford to decarbonise. India has also been phasing natural gas out in recent years \u2014 despite it being less polluting \u2014 while continuing to rely on coal.

Collin Koh, a security fellow at Singapore's S.
