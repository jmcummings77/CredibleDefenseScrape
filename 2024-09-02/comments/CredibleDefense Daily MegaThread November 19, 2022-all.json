            "body": "The agreement, if fully realized, would represent a further deepening of a Russian-Iranian alliance that already has provided crucial support for Moscow's faltering military campaign in Ukraine, the officials said. By acquiring its own assembly line, Russia could dramatically increase its stockpile of relatively inexpensive but highly destructive weapons systems that, in recent weeks, have changed the character of the nine-month-old Ukrainian conflict.\n\nRussia has deployed more than 400 Iranian-made attack drones against Ukraine since August, intelligence officials say, with many of the aircraft used in strikes against civilian infrastructure targets such as power plants. After being forced to abandon Ukrainian territory its forces captured early in the war, Moscow has shifted to a strategy of relentless air assaults on Ukrainian cities, using a combination of cruise missiles and self-detonating drones packed with explosives to knock out electricity and running water for millions of people.\n\nFor Moscow, the agreement could fill a critical need for precision-guided munitions, which are in short supply after nine months of fighting. The arrangement also offers substantial economic and political benefits for Iran, the officials say. While Tehran has sought to portray itself as neutral in the Ukraine conflict, the appearance of Iranian-made drones over Ukrainian cities has triggered threats of new economic sanctions from Europe. Iran's leaders may believe that they can avert new sanctions if the drones are physically assembled in Russia, the officials said.\n\nDetails of the Iran-Russia deal were finalized in the early November meeting, which involved a team of Russian defense-industry negotiators who traveled to Tehran to work out the logistics, according to security officials from two countries that monitored the events. The officials agreed to discuss the matter on the condition that their identities and nationalities not be revealed, citing the need to protect sensitive and ongoing intelligence-collection efforts.\n\nA separate delegation headed by Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev traveled to Tehran on Nov. 9, to discuss, among other topics, economic sanctions and other \"Western interference\" in their governments' affairs, according to state-run Russian and Iranian news media.\n\nOne of the officials briefed on the secret agreement described an aggressive effort by both countries to facilitate production of Iranian-designed drones inside Russia.\n\n\"It is proceeding quickly from decision-making to implementation,\" the official said. \"It is moving fast and it has lot of steam.\"\n\nMultiple NATO countries, including the United States, also have seen the intelligence, but government officials declined to discuss the details. The White House declined to comment on the specific report of Russian-Iranian collaboration.\n\nBut National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement to The Post: \"Iran and Russia can lie to the world, but they can't hide the facts: Tehran is helping kill Ukrainian civilians through the provision of weapons and assisting Russia in its operations. It's another sign of how isolated both Iran and Russia are.\"\n\n\"The United States \u2014 with allies and partners \u2014 is pursuing all means to expose, deter, and confront Iran's provision of these munitions and Russia's use of them against the Ukrainian people. We will continue to provide Ukraine with the critical security assistance it needs to defend itself, including air defense systems,\" Watson added.\n\nA spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington referred reporters to the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense, which did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIran's U.N. mission in New York, in response to questions about the reported technology-sharing arrangement, declined to address the specific allegations. But a spokesman acknowledged that Iran and Russia have \"maintained bilateral defense, scientific, and research cooperation, that predates the start of the Ukrainian conflict.\"\n\nWhile Tehran has publicly declared its neutrality in the conflict, Iran has \"prioritized increasing defense cooperation with other countries\" in the two years since the expiration of a U.N. resolution restricting Iran's ability to sell arms, said Mahdi Nourian, the mission's minister-counselor.\n\n\"Following the alleged claims of using Iranian drones in the Ukraine conflict, Iran has requested a joint expert meeting with Ukraine authorities to consider such allegations,\" Nourian said. \"Significant steps have been taken so far in the collaborative dialogue between Iranian and Ukrainian defense experts, and it will continue to clear up any misunderstanding on this matter.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has harshly criticized Iran's decision to supply arms to Russia and called for new sanctions against the Islamic republic. \"Its complicity in Russian terror must be punished,\" he said in a televised speech Nov. 6.\n\nAfter previously denying that it has supplied drones or missiles to Russia, an Iranian spokesman earlier this month acknowledged that Tehran had sold some of its drones to Moscow, but did so before the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. That claim has come under question following independent examinations of downed drones recovered inside Ukraine. Some of the drones contained Iranian parts stamped with a manufacture date of February 2022, casting doubt on whether the aircraft could have been assembled, shipped to Russia and deployed before the war started.\n\nIran has a long record of supplying weapons to pro-Tehran militia groups, and also for helping key allies begin indigenous production of Iranian-designed missiles and drones. Among the past beneficiaries are governments and Shiite militias in Lebanon, Yemen and Syria, said Michael Knights, a Middle East military and security specialist with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\n\"In this case, Iran is acting as a design bureau for a great power,\" Knights said. \"Iran's economical design and half-century of covert procurement of Western technology is being married to the industrial scale of a great power \u2014 Russia. That will have benefits for both Russia and Iran.\"\n\nRussia already possesses an array of unarmed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, which are used mainly for surveillance and artillery spotting. But Moscow has not invested in large fleets of armed drones of the type that U.S. forces have routinely used in military campaigns in Afghanistan and the Middle East. After expending thousands of its precision-guided missiles in strikes against Ukraine, Russia has turned increasingly to its Iranian partner for attack drones that Knights describes as \"the wave of the future: cheap, fast and good enough.\"\n\nRussian factories previously carried out minor alterations to some of the drones purchased from Iran, changing, for example, the nomenclature and color scheme so they better resemble Russian munitions. But until now there has been no indigenous production of Iranian-designed UAVs on Russian soil, according to the security officials briefed on the new technology-sharing arrangement.\n\nThe officials said it was unclear what kind of assistance Tehran is seeking from Moscow in return, beyond money and the advantages that come from a strengthened alliance with Iran's powerful northern neighbor. In the past, Russia has provided Iran with a surveillance satellite to allow it to spy on its neighbors, as well as key components for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Western news outlets have reported that Iran may be seeking additional nuclear help in exchange for its assistance with Russia's military campaign.\n\n\"What is the 'ask?' We're not sure,\" one of the officials said. \"Clearly the Russians are offering diplomatic and economic assistance. They're also aware of the international pressure on Iran, and they want to help mitigate that.\"\n\nA key question, weapons experts say, is whether Russia can acquire or manufacture the kinds of electronics and optical systems that enable Iran's drones to successfully conduct precision strikes over long distances. Economic sanctions imposed against Iran and Russia have severely restricted the sale of sensitive technology to both countries, including electronic guidance systems.\n\nIndependent analysis of Iranian drones recovered from Ukraine's battlefield has revealed the extent of Iran's continued reliance on foreign countries for key components. An October report based on examinations of three types of Iranian-built drones \u2014 the Mohajer-6, Shahed-131 and Shahed-136 \u2014 identified the existence of engine parts and electronics built by U.S., German and Chinese firms, according to the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based nonprofit that conducted the analysis.\n\nWhile it is unclear precisely how Iran obtained the parts, Tehran has a long history of circumventing international sanctions meant to disrupt work on weapons systems as well as its nuclear power facilities, the report said.\n\nThe pending expiration next year of a U.N. embargo on Iranian ballistic missile sales could given Tehran an additional boost as a weapons merchant, meaning it \"will be free to continue to sell its weapons to Russia and others,\" the report said.",

As Meduza has previously reported, a number of Russian officials have opted for obeying war-related orders from their superiors while at the same time refraining from making militarist speeches. Meduza\u2019s sources named Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin as two examples.\n\n> Nonetheless, Meduza\u2019s sources maintained that despite the widespread discontent surrounding the war, Russian officials and businessmen have no intention of taking any measures against Putin himself. \u201cWe just want all of this to be over as soon as possible,\u201d one said.\n\nLooks like the Kremlin still believes that the West will lose interest first. However, the scepticism is increasing and the technocrats are gaining ground.

According to one of Meduza\u2019s sources, the Kremlin is still hoping that the West\u2019s \u201cconsensus in support of Ukraine will collapse\u201d due to its need for cheap energy.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>The source also noted that the members of the Russian elite who \u201caren\u2019t completely going along with the special [military] operation\u201d are looking wiser and wiser. As Meduza has previously reported, a number of Russian officials have opted for obeying war-related orders from their superiors while at the same time refraining from making militarist speeches. Meduza\u2019s sources named Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin as two examples.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Meduza\u2019s sources maintained that despite the widespread discontent surrounding the war, Russian officials and businessmen have no intention of taking any measures against Putin himself. \u201cWe just want all of this to be over as soon as possible,\u201d one said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looks like the Kremlin still believes that the West will lose interest first. However, the scepticism is increasing and the technocrats are gaining ground. While the business elite still supports Putin, as it currently stands it&#39;s increasingly unlikely that his successor will be from the pro-war faction.</p>\n</div>",

It translates to almost 70 billion cubic meters of consumption per year.\n\n29 were provided by russia (40%).\n\nNow, if russian gas was so incredibly cheaper, 60%, 80% or more would be russian. But that's not the case. Resource cost is just one of the many components for the price of the energy consumed. In fact, just watch 2020 data about gas prices among european nations. Spain doesn't use russian gas at all, [but prices are lower](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1047173/natural-gas-prices-for-households-european-union-country/) than italian ones.\n\nSaying that gas from X is cheaper doesn't mean that is so cheap that you shouldn't use gas that comes from other nations. In fact, dozens of countries in the world don't use russian natural gas, and they're developed economies, and often the prices households pay are lower than those paid by nations that use russian gas (see italy or germany: germany, overall, has the highest electricity prices on earth. Yeah, on earth).\n\nSomeone will say: ok, but now prices went crazy, so more gas would be welcomed. The fact is that world natural gas production [is immense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_production), and there's enough gas for everyone, even without russian gas. First, because russian gas can partially be redirected elsewhere, so if china bought X natural gas from qatar, now they could buy some from russia, and the gas from qatar can be bought by germany, for example (and in fact it is what's happening).\n\nBut most importantly, countries are buying gas from other sources. Let's take the example of Italy again: of the 29 BCM (billion cubic meters) 10 will be replaced by azerbaijan, because italy already operated a pipeline from azerbaijan, that delivers 10 BCM. The stream could be increased by another 10 BCM. So now russia is left with 19 BCM.\n\nExisting contracts with algeria could be increased, and in fact that's what happened. Those count for another 9 BCM iirc. And then 10 BCM are left.\n\nThose are covered by some european nations (norway) and other african suppliers. Also, USA will deliver 50 BCM in the next few years insted of the current maybe less than 10.\n\nMany nations around the world are re/activating new extraction sites to meet this demand.\n\nAlso, many of these contracts are multi-year contracts. They surely won't be \"suppressed\" to return with russia.\n\nWill natural gas prices return to 30 \u20ac/mwh in the next few months? Probably not. Will the supply situation be stabilized in the near term? Maybe not, maybe there could be prices at 60 \u20ac/mwh for some time, many months or maybe 1-2 years. But 60 \u20ac/mwh is not a problem. 350 \u20ac/mwh is a problem. Or 200. 60 \u20ac/mwh is not funny but absolutely manageable.\n\nIf you dig deep into it, it seems like his plan has no logic.\n\nAlso, they destroyed their da\\*n pipelines.",

Somewhere between 360 and 400 total tubes will have been delivered to Ukraine by the end of the year.\n\nThere are a number of variables I can't fully account for, leading to a range. First, I can't find any good numbers on FH-70s. There's anecdotal evidence of a significant number, based on Twitter/Telegram/YouTube clips of their use, but I went conservative here with my numbers. There's a number of deliveries of RTFs and  M109s from Britain and Italy where I have a floor amount + more, where I'm largely ignoring the more.  Third, There are several continuing manufacture/refurb commitments (Zuzannas, RCH 155s , PZH-2000s, Krabs and Ceasars)  which are supplying guns as they are ready, in small but cumulatively significant, numbers. Finally, I'm assuming a certain number of Italian M109s to be delivered by end of year, but haven't counted any Swedish Archers .  A further variable I have no number for, are guns purchased directly by Ukraine from third parties or non-donor states. FH-70s purchased from a broker don't show up as much as Rumanian BMR knockoffs or Israeli APCs, but we know there have been purchases. I can't document a number, so I haven't accounted for this.\n\n400 155mm tubes on the line is above (IMHO) the point of equilibrium, where Ukrainian artillery response to Russian fires is sufficient to conduct defensive operations.\n\n But on the line is not the same as number supplied. First there has been combat losses, primarily M777s and primarily lost to Lancets. Up to 25 towed howitzers have been destroyed or badly damaged, and somewhere between 6 and 10 SPGs. \n\nThe M777s don't over concern me, so long as their crews survived- The US may have decided  the current number of towed artillery to be sufficient, but October delivery of replacement guns show they are willing to keep this number consistent.  Damaged/destroyed SPGs are a low total now, but Russia is making more Lancets; Losses are likely to rise. \n\nSecond, and more important, are repair and maintenance issues. Western guns are proving to be more durable than their maintenance schedules implied, which hardly matters when their rate of fire is many times beyond what NATO expected. Even more impactful: Shoot and scoot is not gentle to big heavy vehicles in the best of times, and no western SPG was designed to stress themselves like this for months. I have no trouble believing that a quarter of Ukraine's 155mms are in (or in transit to/from) repair depots. These factors drop the pool of western guns from approximately 400 down to 300 or even 275. The deficit remains 100 or so guns. \nSo long as deliveries are greater than destruction, the number of guns on the line will rise- As repair depots get better established, the number of guns down for maintenance should drop as well. Will there be enough change to reach my 400 target before the spring?  It bears watching.",

            "body": "Some bad history in this comment reply, some good stuff. IMO a lot of the conversation around the collapse of the Soviet Union in the west, and especially the United States, is pretty far off the mark. Francis Fukiyama, for example, fellated capitalism as the one true economic system as evidenced by the collapse of the USSR. And enough books to build a damn have been written about how Ronald Reagan nobly and heroically toppled the evil empire (except that he wasn't president when the Wall fell, the Pact dissolved, and the USSR collapsed. We dont like Bush tho, taxes and all). Not quite. \n\nThe most important single dynamic you have to remember in the 1980s was the push/pull tension between ideology and economics. Ideologically, many people in the east *were* communists. They liked the system, liked having jobs, and were afraid of the west. Think of it like the conservatism brought about by the status quo. Things may be bad, but if we change it who knows. There were things people didn't like, such as the lack of freedoms and the police state, but for decades this had produced stability and security. Ideologically, Communism had a through line. Marx said that once the revolution began, the Bourgeoisies would eventually come back and try to destroy the revolution, erasing their gains. Lenin said the only way to prevent this backslide into counter-revolution was through a dictatorship run by the party. And Stalin further sharpened it by pointing out that there werent just counterrevolutionaries in the USSR to worry about, there were enemies in Germany, and in the US who would stop at nothing to destroy the home of communism and the nest of the worker's utopia. \n\nIn that ideology space, a lot of people were willing to accept some limitations of freedom in exchange for security. Sure the KGB sucks and midnight arrests are awful, but do you want the Germans to invade again? Yeah the Gulag isn't pleasant, but what would happen if an American spy got loose and targeted the missiles that would blow up my house and factory! Through the 1970s, this fear of the world outside the USSR & its allies was coupled with economic progress. Stalin rebuilt after WWII, Khrushchev came (I would argue) as close as anyone did to making Communism work economically, and Brezhnev sucked but the oil proceeds from the petrol shocks of the 1970s saved the USSR economically while the west was mired in stagnation. But in the 1980s, things changed. The west recovered economically while the *east* stagnated. Not only did it stagnate, it fell significantly behind in terms of automation, miniaturization, and computerization. Russia entirely missed the IT revolution, TV was a luxury and supported as most countries support the arts (what few Russian TV shows there were were quite good!), movies lagged behind, and of course no gaming! Someone was talking shit on D&D earlier in the thread, but think about what a big market for physical and digital games says about your economy. Or put it in real terms, I love Battletech the game. I realized a while back that the when the first Battletech center opened in Chicago in 1990 the USSR had no comparable digital simulators for the VVS. The USAF did, and more advanced. But kids in the US would pay $5/10 min to sit in a simulated cockpit more advanced than anything real shit pilots were using in Russia. That gap is *massive*. \n\nAnd so by the late 1980s, your average Russian (as with Pole, Hungarian, and East German) realized they were missing out. The contract was broken. The state repressed them, took their freedoms, and forced them to live in a stagnant economy which couldn't compete with the west. The nations supposedly destroying themselves to compete with the USSR had not only freedom, but prosperity AND security. God, guns, butter, and the American flag. Or something. And so everyone was ready for a change to something new. But here is where the unwarranted triumphalism gets in the way. Some easterners wanted privatization and capitalism, but many just wanted to reform Communism. I **SUPER** dont want to get into the merits, practically or ideologically, of Communism. If you think the above slate of reforms, free & prosperous Communism, isnt possible thats fine. But lets accept as fact that humans are often irrational and want what they cant have. If youre pro Marx, accept that whatever they were doing they fucked it up. *Edit:* I forgot to say it explicitly, but there a large chunk of people in the east at that time we\u2019re more interested in fixing communism to make it work than becoming capitalist. So when you see demonstrations in 89, 90, 91, etc you have to ask \u2018are these people protesting the regime, the economics, or the ideology.\u2019 Many opposed the first two while supporting the third. And when capitalism came, it was unwelcome. Hence Ostalgie. \n\nThis is also where we should introduce the misalignment between Russia and its satellites. East Germany sat on the front line, it was easy to draw comparisons between East and West, they *should* have some kind of parity. Hungary used to be part of a much larger network of countries, its division by the iron curtain was unnatural. Poland, Romania, and the entire Pact was embeggarad by the USSR as it extracted wealth for itself (and then transferred that wealth to the GDR via massive loans, never paid back). So while Communism wasn't working for just about anybody in Europe, it worked for the USSR just a *little* bit better and for the Pact a whole lost *worse*. This is why you see a collapse of Communism in Poland and Germany first, and Russia much later. Their system really only fell apart once they could no longer extract wealth from their neighbors. Then the contradictions really began to show, and people really became upset at the failures of Gorbachev and the system as a whole. \n\nSo what happened in the 1990s in Russia that didn't happen anywhere else? Everywhere else, except in East Germany, a ruling class emerged which had credentials as anti-Russian, nationalistic, and thus capable of taking power (and wealth). Solidarity, for example, helped turn Poland into a modern liberal capitalist state. But in Russia, the alternative to the Communists was either gangs, or the Communists (in an Italian suit, totally different). Really the great Russian disaster was Yeltsin and privatization. In many countries (including Ukraine!) privatization was a clusterfuck. The only people with the money to buy & run companies when they went private were the kind of people who have large quantities of wealth in command economies, the planners or the people stealing from the planners. Black market thugs began multimillionaire corporate leaders overnight. They then fought a war on the streets to figure out who'd be in charge. Yeltsin ended the war by making them into the Oligarchs. Yeltsin then peaced out, and along with his friends cashed in much to western applause. Meanwhile people in Russia got FUCKED. The change in Russian population from 1980 to 2000 is staggering. In 1980 the USSR had a population of \\~260 million. In 2000? \\~140m. In 1980 the GDP was $1.2t, and was second only to the US. In 2000 it may have been as low as $250b. Russia's GDP would only pass that of the USSR in 2007! And in terms of territory, Russia was smaller than it had been since the Partition of Poland. Were talking about a level of population and GDP reduction exceeding that of World War Two! Now, much of this wasn't destroyed as it was during WWII. Millions of people changed country overnight as SSRs which had previously been integral to the Stalinist USSR left (this includes Ukraine). Those people didn't die, they changed citizenship. But for Russia this was still a huge loss. Millions more moved to the west and the US, or had been living abroad in a friendly country and decided to stay and naturalize. But millions of people *did* die as Russian society fell apart. Murders went up, mobs killed each other and innocents. The safety code inspector got fired, your building fell apart, and the mold or the contaminated paint or the poor safety killed you. People starved because good Ukrainian agriculture was suddenly across an international border. Companies which had previously been state funded laid off millions of workers because suddenly they had to care about profits. Supply chains (for example with the heavily industrialized Ukrainian east) collapsed. Hospitals started charging rather large sums, while care decreased thanks to skills flight. The former Pact members and the US benefited from this, while Russia suffered. \n\nAnd so you saw the growth of two things, first the conspiracy theory that this was the west's intention all along, and second the willingness (which continues today) to trade basically anything for stability and security. Out stepped Yeltsin, in stepped Putin. Its absolutely impossible to overstate how much he did to turn Russia around. As I said, in 2000 Russia's GDP was $250b. By 2013 it was $2.2t, a nearly 10x growth! Putin isn't a wizard, he didn't do anything other than bring stability. Russia, given its size and rich resources *should* be a global economic power, Putin just allowed these conditions to reassert themselves. But because it happened under him, people loved him. And the affair only broke as Russia's economic and social position has once again begun to slip.",

For a more meaningful comparison you should either compare the USSR population in the 1980's from the population in all the former USSR countries (including Ukraine, Baltic states, etc...) and then the situation is not so bad although you do notice a dip in the 1990's (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Population_of_former_USSR.PNG)\n\nAlternatively you should compare former USSR Russia with current Russia, but the picture is pretty similar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia#Population you see a little dip in the 90's but overall you don't see the demographic catastrophe you mention in your post.\n\nFor a country to almost halve its population, you would need an unfathomable war scenario (not even the great famines in Ukraine in the 30's or WWII in the USSR did this).

Your argument is as skewed as claiming that Great Britain went through a massive demographic decline of 90% when its population decreased from ~500M (population of the British empire) to ~50M (UK) after WWII.\n\nFurther the missing 6M Russians mostly emigrated (in great part to Israel), so your comparison is again a tad skewed.\n\nAlso if you want to compare this population loss with WWII statistics, it is a bit disingenuous to compare them with the military casualties of the 3rd Reich. A better comparison is against the military deaths of Soviets (10.5M) or with the civilians included (23.5M), which would account for 13% of the USSR population.\n\nSorry but this comparison is totally misleading and borderline rubbish.",
