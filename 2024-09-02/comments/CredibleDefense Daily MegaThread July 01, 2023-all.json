Takeaways include:\n\n-Air superiority is key to choking off logistics and ensuring fast victory. Russia failed to achieve this air superiority because of a lack of joint operations and failure to evolve beyond its platforms. Russia's air force's sum was less than its parts.\n\n-Air access--use of air assets strategically in a contested environment for maximum effect.\n\n-Building broad-based counter-A2AD capabilities in NATO is a major priority. Want to avoid brutal artillery slog like in Ukraine.  \n\n-Private space power is making access to space cheaper and more important than ever. Starlink has been critical for Ukrainian efforts, but other space capabilities have been important as well. Space is likely to grow more contested--it's key to develop defensive and offensive capabilities in this area. Commercial satellite imaging has democratized access and understanding of the war like never before.\n\n-Low-end munitions(eg drones) + networking blur the line between unmanned systems and precision weapons. \n\n-Collaborative Combat Aircraft will work with F-35s, including those of NATO partners. Idea is still being finalized, may include countermeasures, weapons load, sensors, etc. while being more expendable than a manned aircraft.\n\n-Russians may see their cruise and ballistic missiles as an asymmetric advantage at the moment. A more complex air environment overall demands a more layered approach. Ex: unexpected resurgence of gun-based AD.\n\n-Deeper magazine depths are critical, perhaps more important than being at the absolute cutting edge. Quantity gives leeway in being able to use capabilities more freely. \n\n-Information sharing is another priority. **US went from sharing 30 points of interest a month with NATO partners to sharing 3,000 a month with a stroke of a pen**. More to be done in other areas, like F-35 info sharing.\n\n-Dispersal of units is getting more focus. The rise of precision munitions means that aircraft must be dispersed across multiple airbases. Locations are changed to remain inside of the enemy's decision cycle.\n\nThis is a podcast, if you are looking for a similar resource in text form, I highly recommend [RUSI's article \"The Russian Air War and Ukrainian Requirements for Air Defence\"](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/russian-air-war-and-ukrainian-requirements-air-defence).\n\n>This episode comes to you from Ramstein Air Base, where Ryan spoke with Gen.

While Bradleys with long range TOW etc are better used on the plains to the south. Sweden is roughly 70% forests, and the CV90 was constructed with that in mind.\n\nCherevaty is the official representative of the Eastern Task Force of the UAF.\n\nEdit: Oliver also reported this yesterday:\n\n> Military spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty tells me Russian contingent in and around Bakhmut is around 50,000 - it never went below 35,000, he says. Russia has fortified positions greatly. But Ukraine still making progress in mission to close the circle around the largely destroyed city\n\nSounds like a crazily high number considering Russia is defending in the area now, why would Russia keep that many troops there for defensive purposes.

If they try to poke their noses in large forces, they will receive the same, but on a larger scale.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>https://t . me/SALDO_VGA/960</p>\n\n<p>And, by evening, our favorite doomer Girkin replied</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fighting on the bridgehead near Alyosha continues. According to reports, after the commander was wounded (let me remind you that the fighting is under continuous fire from the high bank of the Dnieper), our units retreated from under the bridge, there is again an enemy. The hotel is behind our divisions. <strong>Reports of the destruction of the bridgehead were premature.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a> . me/strelkovii/5841</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Sources are important, and when you source it from guys like him, all you&#39;re doing is garbage in, garbage out analyses.</p>\n</div>",

Of course the skepticism turned out to be wrong in that Putin actually did end up invading but the skepticism was right in that the main invasion of Kiev and Kharkiv failed to overcome Ukrainian defenses and the Russians in the East and South East only secured 20% of the country before the lines started solidifying.",

It'd be dangerous to do this, and one should expect significant losses, but losses may be acceptable if radar assets can datalink locations to the F-16s can be pushed that close to the front line. \n\nMy understanding is that a single patriot radar vehicle can be used for stuff like this without dealing with all the usual patriot mobility issues, but IIRC a lot of southern Ukraine can be seen by NATO AWACS when they fly missions over the Black Sea (someone correct my math if I'm wrong on that).

            "body": "The F-16, as with all aircraft including the Mig-29 and Su-27, would do very well against any rotary wing. Its like saying Ukrainian SOF could take out the Bolshoi cast. Its not really a fair fight, because one isn't playing the same game as the other. \n\nThe issue with every single 'well the F-16 could...' post are the same. First, the R-37M is a major obstacle, and if Russia is playing its airforce properly they wont be able to get close. This is why the Mig-29s arnt already shooting the KA-52 out of the sky, they only operate now because of the contested airspace produced by AD and the fixed wing deadlock. The F-16 will suffer from this problem just as much as any other non-stealth fighter. Second, flying low and fast is great for doing preplanned CAS missions. Sorties where you have a general understanding where the target is, you plug it into your GPS in a safe zone, and then rely on the weapon to make up for a rushed and unoptimized release. The AAMRAM is not like a ground attack weapon. You need to get a radar lock with your aircraft, so youre radiating for the entire world to see and shoot at. And physics *matter* a hell of a lot more for the A2A missile than otherwise. MAR in a jet on jet engagement on the deck may be as little as 5nmi with the AAMRAM thanks to air density. Not sure what it would be like for a helicopter, likely a larger range. But youre not pulling off some 40nmi wunderkind kill flying fast on the deck. Just as a hey how are ya, the SA-8 Gecko, which is very plentiful and fires a very cheap missile, has a range of about 10nmi. The SA-11 is better still, and the S-300 is even better still. And the Mig-31 launched R-37M even better still, because theyre firing a very good missile at optimal altitude and speed. \n\nIf taking down Russian helicopters were this easy, Ukraine already has everything it needs to do just that.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The F-16, as with all aircraft including the Mig-29 and Su-27, would do very well against any rotary wing. Its like saying Ukrainian SOF could take out the Bolshoi cast. Its not really a fair fight, because one isn&#39;t playing the same game as the other. </p>\n\n<p>The issue with every single &#39;well the F-16 could...&#39; post are the same. First, the R-37M is a major obstacle, and if Russia is playing its airforce properly they wont be able to get close. This is why the Mig-29s arnt already shooting the KA-52 out of the sky, they only operate now because of the contested airspace produced by AD and the fixed wing deadlock. The F-16 will suffer from this problem just as much as any other non-stealth fighter. Second, flying low and fast is great for doing preplanned CAS missions. Sorties where you have a general understanding where the target is, you plug it into your GPS in a safe zone, and then rely on the weapon to make up for a rushed and unoptimized release. The AAMRAM is not like a ground attack weapon. You need to get a radar lock with your aircraft, so youre radiating for the entire world to see and shoot at. And physics <em>matter</em> a hell of a lot more for the A2A missile than otherwise. MAR in a jet on jet engagement on the deck may be as little as 5nmi with the AAMRAM thanks to air density. Not sure what it would be like for a helicopter, likely a larger range. But youre not pulling off some 40nmi wunderkind kill flying fast on the deck. Just as a hey how are ya, the SA-8 Gecko, which is very plentiful and fires a very cheap missile, has a range of about 10nmi. The SA-11 is better still, and the S-300 is even better still.

SAMs are ground based so can only see to the horizon, as you get further away you can fly higher without being seen. The Ka 52s use this to sit a good few kms from the front and fire missiles at Ukrainian targets in a couple of seconds before dipping below the horizon (every one of the recent Ka 52 videos you see the shot end with a sharp bank, likely dropping down. ) So there is an envelope aircraft can operate in. This is why you see helicopters so low but able to get close to the front.\n\nNow what a fast attack jets offers is real speed, especially if it is relatively clean, low drag. This means it can fly higher and get closer to the front as it has the legs to outrun many SAMs by beating them to their range. The SAM is faster but the MiG 29 or F-16 has the head start and so can beat it to its max range. This means they have a much longer distance to their horizons and can fly a kind of CAP though it will be a very cat and mouse game.\n\nThe down side is down at the deck where air is thick enough to breath it is very tough of air frames. All that super soupy thick air causes a lot of stress plus the thermal from the ground will shake you around. So you really hammer your total flight life on the airframe and rack up lots of maintenance time.\n\nI do not know but suspect they would be tasked with being much further back and higher so only really threatened by the S-400s but patrolling to keep fixed wing aviation as far from the battle as possible? But further away and higher they will likely pick up the ~~Havocks~~ Hockums much eariler and be able to guide other assets to be waiting for them? Super speculative on my part here. But perhaps Fencers are a better shout to be going in low and close to the front if they still have some AAMs for them. They could use F-16 to vector them to the right bit of airspace to be waiting for a shot.... as said, super speculative on my part.",

If we were to call this a breakthrough then Russia would have been making &quot;breakthroughs&quot; every week around bakhmut by simply pushing the line back a kilometer. It&#39;s a gradual systematic advance.</p>\n</div>",

Russia, which has not signed the treaty, has used antipersonnel mines far more extensively, rights groups say.\n> \n> The bodyweight-triggered mines in question are considered particularly pernicious and violate international laws of war because they harm soldiers and civilians indiscriminately. Their small size and innocuous appearance can lead to children or other civilians handling them unknowingly.  \n> \n>   \n> The rights group examined photographs of the remains of rockets found in eastern Ukraine that are used exclusively to scatter PFM-1S antipersonnel mines.

Russia, which has not signed the treaty, has used antipersonnel mines far more extensively, rights groups say.</p>\n\n<p>The bodyweight-triggered mines in question are considered particularly pernicious and violate international laws of war because they harm soldiers and civilians indiscriminately. Their small size and innocuous appearance can lead to children or other civilians handling them unknowingly.  </p>\n\n<p>The rights group examined photographs of the remains of rockets found in eastern Ukraine that are used exclusively to scatter PFM-1S antipersonnel mines.
