        "body": "Some news regarding the structure of the Russian Armed Forces. Apparently, the 1st and the 2nd Army Corps (i.e. the former armies of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, respectively) are likely to have been reformed into Combined Arms Armies. This is not officially confirmed yet either from the Russian MoD or from Ukrainian sources, but at this point I would say there is enough evidence to report this.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a lot of channels linked to the \"Akhmat\" galaxy as well as Kadyrov himself began mentioning the \u201c3rd Combined Arms Army\u201d (CAA) as part of the Southern Military District.\n\nhttps://t. me/RKadyrov_95/4944\n\nSpecifically, the first post is dated July 12 and mentions the 4th [Motorized] Brigade as part of the 3rd CAA. \n\nhttps://t. me/AptiAlaudinovAKHMAT/4909\n\nIt's well known that until now this brigade was part of the 2nd Corps. At first I thought it was a mistake, but subsequent publications have changed my mind. Even this channel (in spite of the not-yet-updated name), which until mid July was mentioning the 4th Brigade as part of the 2nd Corps, has started referring to this brigade as part of the 3rd Army: this cannot be a mistake.\n\nhttps://t. me/medsluzba_speznaz_akhmat/86\n\nBy the way, the 4th Motorized Brigade (a historical brigade of the LPR Army, based in Khrustalnyi in Luhansk Oblast), currently active in the southern flank of the Chasiv Yar sector, is often mentioned by Akhmat-related channels as it works closely with Akhmat units such as the 78th Motorized Regiment \u201cSever-Akhmat\u201d and detachments of the \u201cAkhmat Special Forces\u201d. The commander of the \u201cAkhmat Special Forces\u201d (Major General Apti Alaudinov) was the deputy commander of the 2nd Corps until April. In general, Kadyrov's men have quite some influence in the 2nd Corps. \n\nThis channel, too, run by the commander of the \u201cShustrogo\u201d Detachment of the \u201cAkhmat Special Forces\u201d as well as of the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Motorized Brigade, recently updated the bio, mentioning the 4th Brigade as part of the 3rd CAA.\n\nhttps://t. me/shustryii_i\n\nI investigated on VK and found a [photo](https://i.imgur.com/6nN3oNx.jpeg), published during this week, featuring an official recognition issued by the command of the 3rd CAA (*3 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f*), which also features the logo of the new army (which doesn't match the logo of any of the existing armies). Note the colors of the former LPR flag behind the logo. Interestingly, the new CAA does not appear to have inherited the \u201cGuards\u201d status from the 2nd Army Corps for the time being. In any case, this made me sure that the 2nd Corps during this month was indeed reformed into the 3rd Army. \n\nWhy 3rd? At first I thought because it was the first available number not occupied by existing CAAs, but this number is actually logical from a historical point of view. During the course of Operation \"Gallop\", on the morning of February 14, 1943, the vanguards of the divisions of the 18th Rifle Corps (as part of the 3rd Guards Army) penetrated the city of Luhansk (back then Voroshilovgrad), liberating it from the Germans.\n\nIncidentally, in mid June the Russian Telegram channel \u201cNorthern Channel\u201d, run by servicemen of the Group of Forces \u201cNorth\u201d, had mentioned the transfer to the Kharkiv sector (from Donetsk Oblast) of elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade as part of... the 51st Army. \n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1282\n\nAt the time I thought it was a mistake. Thinking back and linking this to the other news, at this point I find it very likely that 1st Corps too is being reformed as a CAA, specifically into the 51st Army.\n\nAgain, why 51st? During the course of the Second Donbas strategic offensive, on the morning of September 8, 1943, units of the 50th Guards Rifle Divisions of the 3rd Guards Rifle Corps (part of the 5th Shock Army), entered Donetsk (back then Stalino), liberating the city. The \u201cissue\u201d for the Russians is that there is already an army with this number - the 5th CAA of Eastern MD. However, the 3rd Guards Rifle Corps had been transferred to the 5th Shock Army only at the end of August: until then it was fighting as part... of the 51st Army, which in any case continued to support the offensive of the Southern Front in the Donbas. Consequently, naming it 51st Army makes historical sense.\n\nA few final considerations. Firstly, there is no evidence at the moment that this reform is accompanied by the creation of new maneuver brigades or by the reform of some of the existing brigades into divisions. Unless this is disproved, in the front this reform should not have major consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, this reform has a primarily and fundamentally organizational and administrative purpose. During the Donbas War of 10 years ago and in the following period, the armies of the two self-proclaimed republics were under the operational subordination of the 8th CAA of the Southern MD. When after the sham referendums these two oblasts joined Russia, the two armies became the 1st and 2nd Army Corps of the 8th CAA, as part of the Southern MD. The problem is that this resulted in a huge army, totally disproportionate to the average size of the other CAAs. Let's take into account that already until 2022 the 8th CAA was quite large compared to the average - fielding the 20th and 150th Motorized Divisions in addition to an artillery brigade, a rocket brigade and the other support units. The \u201cmedian\u201d Russian CAA is comparable in size to a NATO division, just a little bigger; the larger ones (1st GTA, 58th CAA) could be comparable to a NATO corps, but then there is the 29th CAA consisting of only one (!) maneuver brigade (+ the support units). \n\nWith the 1st and 2nd Corps joining it, the 8th CAA had become extremely larger than the other CAAs; the only one among these formations to reach the size of an actual field army. Let's recall that the 1st and 2nd Corps are very large, in fact their nominal complement and equipment would make them stronger and bigger than most CAAs. Both the corps field six motorized brigades (1st Corps: 1st, 5th, 9th, 110th, 114th, 132nd; 2nd Corps: 4th, 6th, 7th, 85th, 88th, 123rd) + the rifle regiments of the mobilization reserve (a dozen for the 1st Corps, several for the 2nd) + several separate battalions (including maneuver ones) + an artillery brigade (1st Corps: 14th; 2nd Corps: 2nd) + the other support units. This is extremely more than the typical Russian corps, which consists of either one maneuver division and one maneuver brigade or two maneuver brigades, plus some minor support units (most of the corps for instance do not have an artillery brigade). \n\nWith such a reform, the former 1st and 2nd Corps will probably receive an improvement in terms of support units that they don't have now (such as a rocket brigade, an anti-aircraft rocket brigade, a control brigade, an engineer-sapper regiment, a CBRN regiment etc), since at the moment the support units are absolutely undersized in relation to their maneuver units, compared to the median Russian CAA. In addition, I imagine they are going to increase and strengthen their HQ Staff. Who knows if on the Russian side this is a way to further dilute the power of the \u201cold guard\u201d officers from the Donbas. Let's recall, however, that the 1st and 2nd Corps have been largely made up of soldiers from Russia proper for a while, after the huge losses of their servicemen who were veterans of the Donbas War and of those mobilized from these two republics during 2022. \n\nIn all of this, the status of the 3rd Army Corps (the one formed by volunteers during the summer of 2022 to reinforce the meager Russian forces at the front, and which was brought to strength in the following fall thanks to the influx of mobilized men), is unclear. It was never even really clear to which military district it belongs. Officially it was formed in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and was said to be part of the then Western MD (some Russian sources gave it subordinate to the 20th CAA), later for a Russian source it may have joined the Southern MD; however its 72nd Motorized Brigade was formed in Orenburg Oblast, and for the Ukrainian observer Mashovets this brigade is based in Omsk (both these oblasts fall under the Central MD). At the moment its units are fighting under the GoF \u201cSouth\u201d: the 72nd Brigade together with most of the 6th Motorized Division (made up of the recently formed 54th Motorized Regiment and several regiments of the Territorial Forces) are fighting in the southern flank of the Chasiv Yar sector, while the 57th Motorized Regiment of the 6th Motorized Division is fighting together with the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA in the Kurakhove sector (again under the jurisdiction of the GoF \u201cSouth\u201d). There is currently no evidence that this corps has joined one of these two new CAAs mentioned above.",

An estimated 10-15 people were killed with over 30 more injured. Casualty wise, this is one of the more significant attacks launched by Hezbollah.\n\n**Initial strikes:**\n\nHere\u2019s footage of the initial rockets hitting the field:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1edkogu/hezbollah\\_rocket\\_attack\\_against\\_a\\_playground\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/1edkogu/hezbollah_rocket_attack_against_a_playground_and/)\n\nSoccer players running out of the field, right after it was hit:  \n[https://twitter.com/HananyaNaftali/status/1817228506901643550/video/1](https://twitter.com/HananyaNaftali/status/1817228506901643550/video/1)\n\n**Aftermath footage:**\n\n1.

[Video #1, families running towards the site](https://twitter.com/HenMazzig/status/1817236379098591519/video/2)\n\n**Weaponry and targeting:**\n\nThe soccer field is located approx. 8-10 km from the Lebanon border, adjusted for where a launch site might be.

The picture reveals modernizations applied to this fighter to enable the use of SDB.*\n\n*The first indications of the potential adaptation of the MiG-29 to carry GBU-39 bombs emerged in public domain in late May 2024. Journalists mentioned that these guided aerial bombs could have been used against russian forces starting as early as February 2024.*\n\n*However, up until now, there have been very few images publicly available that confirm the adaptation of the MiG-29 for the GBU-39. The new detailed picture of the MiG-29 with integrated SDBs comes from the Air_Winged profile on X social media.*\n\n*In the photo, the GBU-39 bombs are mounted on a standard BRU-61/A rack, which can hold up to four of these aerial munitions. Notably, the pylon-adapter appears to differ slightly from the pylon used for the JDAM-ER (Joint Direct Attack Munition \u2013 Extended Range) on the same aircraft model.*\n\n*Still, it's quite likely that the integration of the SDB might have been developed using the same technical solutions as in the case with the JDAM-ER.*\n\n*There are also reports suggesting the possible integration of the GBU-39 on Ukrainian Su-27 fighters. However, the photos supporting these claims only show the pylon configuration, which could be used for such an upgrade but do not confirm the integration itself.*\n\n*For a brief reminder, the GBU-39 bombs have a weight of 130 kilograms and a declared maximum range of 110 kilometers when dropped from an altitude of 12 kilometers. The practical range of the SDB when used from Ukrainian planes, which tend to stay much lower for safety, remains unknown.*\n\n*A notable technological paradox is that the SDB bombs are also a component of the GLSDB (Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb) missile system. However, air-dropped munitions exhibit better accuracy when deployed from aircraft. This paradox and the reasons behind it were explored in a separate article by Defense Express.*",

We do see attempts to regulate social media, TT and Facebook for having an adverse effect on subscribers, especially young ones but nothing ever seems to happen. Those behind such reforms are talking about specific tools used by those SM platforms that can lead to mind manipulation. \n\nWhat I really wanted to post about was the much earlier article I read at Reddit on the technical aspects of TikTok user data mining and ever increasing circles of surveillance leading to overlaps with other users contributing to massive amounts of data stored on CCP computer systems to be analyzed to reveal area demographics, behavior patters and much more, also geolocation data. Say for example a TT user has a relative with a friend in the DoD. Somewhere, sometime classified data might be revealed innocently which causes an alert notification on CCP computers. The author of the article had looked at the TT code and reported on its features as regards security issues. He then referred to another article about a skilled IT person who had analyzed the code in great detail to see what it enabled TT to do with user date. He deferred to this article for the final word on TT risks. So it looks like TT can collect massive amounts of data from a billion users to enter in a database which can be used by the CCP to learn who, what, when, wher, who their friends are and where they are located. Grand surveillance of a nation's population for use by their military. This goes well beyond mind manipulation by social media platforms. Of course you could always say that all US social media is under contract to US government intelligence agencies. Personally, I don't have a problem with that. With China it is different as they could use these tools to wage war on us.",

A small drone needs to be set up, take off, then fly towards the enemy, at a much slower speed, taking far more time per engagement.\n\n2. This applies primarily to Javelin, but the warhead is much larger. A correlated metal shed around the tank is usually enough to fend off most FPVs. That does basically nothing to an ATGM.  The same applies to most ERA and composite armor. The ATGM is also far more likely to destroy, rather than lightly damage, what it hits.\n\n3. The NLAW and Javelin aren\u2019t effected by drone jamming equipment.

If you increase supply and also increase demand, then you have essentially done nothing to change the global balance. Excessive production needs to be combined with demand destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Norway has by far the best policies in this regard, but Biden isn&#39;t that far behind. He did increase production and he&#39;s also reducing demand. Both parts are equally important!</p>\n</div>",
