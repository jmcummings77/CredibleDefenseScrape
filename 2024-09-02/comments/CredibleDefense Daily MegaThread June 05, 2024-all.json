Gorgan regularly reported to Makarov on Moldova's domestic political situation and provided information on visits from Ukrainian Ministry of Defense representatives, who came to Moldova to purchase military equipment and ammunition. Gorgan served in the General Staff until late 2021, when the country\u2019s new Western-leaning president Maia Sandu requested his resignation. Before the July 2023 mass expulsion of Russian spies working in Moldova under diplomatic cover in Moldova,, Gorgan even managed to secure a job at the UN. Leveraging his remaining connections in the Moldovan Defense Ministry, Gorgan continues to be a key GRU informant.\n> \n> Igor Gorgan and Alexei Makarov began particularly active communications in April 2022, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Their confidential meetings primarily occurred in cafes in Chisinau or during fishing trips. \u201cI can meet anyone, I am a man of action, we need to move forward faster! We should go fishing and talk about everything! We're living in historic times! And we have to make this history!\u201d reads one of the messages from the Moldovan general.\n> \n> Judging by these reports, the GRU was particularly interested in what kind of weapons Kyiv buys from neighboring countries \u2014 including Moldova. General Gorgan immediately reported: \u201cUkraine\u2019s [state defense exporter] Ukroboronexport is trying to buy back (or take with the help of \u2018partners\u2019) 6 Mig-29s from Moldova, which are in M\u0103rcule\u0219ti. They insist very strongly... So far the airplanes are in place. They want to \u2018pull off\u2019 the operation through a front company from the United Arab Emirates in the near future.\u201d\n> \n> Gorgan sent another message on the same day: \u201cRailroad trains with fuel are coming from the territory of Moldova, namely from the village of Etulia to the Ukrainian settlement of Reni. The train with fuel moves only at night, during the day it stands still in order not to become a target of the Russian Federation's Aerospace Forces (VKS).\u201d\n> \n> \u201cThank you,\u201d Colonel Makarov replies.\n> \n> Another message to the handler followed soon after: \u201cThe Ukrainians have been walking around our Ministry of Defense for three weeks asking for everything \u2014 artillery shells in particular.\u201d\n> \n> Agent Gorgan was also restless about arms deliveries to Ukraine via Romania. Here\u2019s the advice he gave to Colonel Makarov: \u201cIt\u2019s essential to close the border with Romania as soon as possible! It's a big hole! A lot of cargo comes to Ukraine from there. Especially military cargo! The Romanians still have some military factories that produce weapons and ammunition.\u201d\n\n> < snip >\n> \n> In 2013, he became the Chief of General Staff of Moldova, but a conflict with then Defense Minister Anatol Salaru forced him to leave the military. In 2019, after Kremlin prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Igor Dodonwon Moldova\u2019s presidential election, Gorgan again headed the General Staff. He remained in this position until September 2021, when new President Maia Sandu asked him to resign.\n> \n> Nevertheless, many of Gorgan's proxies still retain their posts in the ministry, using their access to supply him with secret information.

Specifically, they\u2019re interested in the radio-electronic component of this complex, which was produced in Chisinau. We are talking about the electronic control units of the TOCHKA-U!!!!

This is due to Gazprom\u2019s reliance on pipelines and lack of LNG export capabilities. The report is also seemingly relying on the Siberia 2 pipeline linking Russia and China to be completed, but [there's still no progress on this front](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-china-gas-pipeline-deal-stalls-over-beijings-price-demands-ft-2024-06-02/) more than 6 months after the report was drafted, making Gazprom\u2019s irrelevance likely to continue indefinitely.

In an ideal world, they\u2019d use their fossil fuel exports to help fund that pivot into things like mining, tourism, tech, improved agriculture, etc. But the money is instead being devoted to the war effort.

A massive addition to Russian coffers, a stronger position against NATO and a West decidedly in decline from the world\u2019s point of view.

Led by the United Kingdom, the competition will dish out funds to successful bidders in hopes of delivering significant quantities FPV drones to Ukraine. These types of munitions have become critical on both sides of the front lines in the war in Ukraine; so much so that it has spurred an arms race for them.*\n\n*The competition, led by the U.K. Ministry of Defense with assistance from the Latvian Ministry of Defense, was formally opened yesterday. The initiative is part of plans orchestrated by the Drone Capability Coalition, which was made public in February and is headed by the U.K. and Latvia. The Drone Capability Coalition has the aim of supplying Kyiv with over a million drones, predominately FPV types, by the end of the year.*\n\n*Companies from across the coalition are encouraged to apply, which includes the U.K., Latvia, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Ukraine. In order to have submissions assessed as part of the competition, entrants must submit their proposals by July 1, per the U.K. Ministry of Defense solicitation.*\n\n*\"The UK and Latvia have opened the bidding for companies to supply FPV drones to Ukraine, on behalf of the Drone Capability Coalition,\" the U.K. Ministry of Defense states. \"This competition aims to produce these drones at scale and at an affordable price point, leveraging the strength of Western industry.\"*\n\n*According to the U.K. Ministry of Defense, the coalition aims to \"procure up to 15 batches of first-person view racing quadcopter style drones, consisting of 20 drones each [300 in total] and potential associated options.\" The total contract award for up to 300 FPV drones is valued at \u00a3300,000 (over $383,000 at current conversion rates.) This puts the cost at $1,000 ($1,277) per drone.*\n\n*It also states that FPV drones \"capable of carrying varying payloads depending on their propeller size\" are desired. While specific payload requirements aren't specified in the solicitation, FPV-type kamikaze drones, with improvised warheads, have been used heavily by both sides during the war \u2014 including against air and sea targets. Other Western countries, including the U.S., are working to acquire and hone their skills on FPV and FPV-like loitering munitions/kamikaze drones.*\n\n*\"First-person view drones have proven highly effective on the battlefield since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion,\" the U.K. Ministry of Defense notes, \"providing Ukrainian operators with situational awareness to target enemy positions, armored vehicles, and ships with explosive ordnance.\"*\n\n*The solicitation notes that for the successful bidder(s), FPV drone proposals \"must be produced and dispatched for testing within three weeks of a contract award (expected the week commencing 12 August 2024). ... Bidders are to ensure that their system meets all qualification questions & entry criteria prior to submitting their proposal.\"*\n\n*From there, the entries will be subjected to testing and evaluation, which will last up to three months. The intent is that, following those tests, bidders whose entries meet the necessary requirements will be considered for potential future production contracts of many thousands of drones.*\n\n*Failure to submit a proposal by July 1 does not preclude interested companies from throwing their hat in the ring further down the road. As the Ministry of Defense highlights, \"additional FPV competitions are expected to take place through 2024, building on the lessons learned from this first competition.\"*",

Also the tactics and platforms keep evolving with drones doing basically the entire gambit of WW1 airplane development with now you have drones that hunt other drones and drone carriers etc. Eventually it will all end up with advanced drones that cost a decent amount of money and look a lot like what the US is already developing.</p>\n</div>",
