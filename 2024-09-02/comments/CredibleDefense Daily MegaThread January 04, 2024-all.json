      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

                                    "body": ">In what way is supplying air defence over the skies of an allied nation at their request an act of war?\n\nNATO has no obligations to Ukraine as we are not officially allied with the country (which is why Russia was able to invade in the first place). Firstly, \u201cAt their request\u201d would immediately make us a party in the war. Secondly, it would be an act of war because defensive action would necessitate offensive action against Russian air forces. \n\n>And NATO jets don't have to shoot everything in the sky, just like they don't shoot Russian jets from the Polish border, or when they're over the black sea. They just have to shoot things (mainly cruise missiles) within Ukrainian air space. \n\nIgnoring that this would make us a party in the conflict, how could we guarantee this? What happens when tactical VKS aircraft attack in the Kherson region? Are we going to shoot them down? What happens when an American F-16 gets downed by a VKS MiG who thinks he\u2019s firing on a Ukrainian fighter? Imposing a no-fly zone requires proactive action against intruders, and Russian WILL test the limits. This is not a risk any political figure in NATO wants to take. \n\n>I would like to point out that a manned RAF plane got fired at by Russian planes whilst in international air space and it didn't start WW3.\n\nThe attack was not part of a larger strategy to destroy any NATO aircraft in and around Ukraine. It was an accident and it also failed to down the aircraft. NATO also has not put up conditions that downing that aircraft would be an act of war. \n\n>If Russia chooses to launch fighters, then they'll only lose them if they enter the no fly zone, which would have clear borders in Western Ukraine. I think this would be unlikely given that the front lines would be more heavily covered by AA in this case and Ukraine has no need to\n\nAgain, no guarantee on the these \u201cborders\u201d to keep Russians out, as this would also be us directly joining the war if we were to enforce it against Russian aircraft. \n\n>Russia would then have to choose to escalate by engaging legitimately present (according to international law) NATO air assets within Ukrainian territory which they themselves are illegally invading, in a sphere where they are heavily outmatched.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where the source is on the legitimacy of such an intervention, but it doesn\u2019t really matter as international law means jack sh*t to Russia. The escalation would be on our part by imposing fighter patrols that can and will shoot down Russian aircraft. Russia would immediately consider NATO aircraft valid targets.

                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>In what way is supplying air defence over the skies of an allied nation at their request an act of war?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NATO has no obligations to Ukraine as we are not officially allied with the country (which is why Russia was able to invade in the first place). Firstly, \u201cAt their request\u201d would immediately make us a party in the war. Secondly, it would be an act of war because defensive action would necessitate offensive action against Russian air forces. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And NATO jets don&#39;t have to shoot everything in the sky, just like they don&#39;t shoot Russian jets from the Polish border, or when they&#39;re over the black sea. They just have to shoot things (mainly cruise missiles) within Ukrainian air space. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ignoring that this would make us a party in the conflict, how could we guarantee this? What happens when tactical VKS aircraft attack in the Kherson region? Are we going to shoot them down? What happens when an American F-16 gets downed by a VKS MiG who thinks he\u2019s firing on a Ukrainian fighter? Imposing a no-fly zone requires proactive action against intruders, and Russian WILL test the limits. This is not a risk any political figure in NATO wants to take. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would like to point out that a manned RAF plane got fired at by Russian planes whilst in international air space and it didn&#39;t start WW3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The attack was not part of a larger strategy to destroy any NATO aircraft in and around Ukraine. It was an accident and it also failed to down the aircraft. NATO also has not put up conditions that downing that aircraft would be an act of war. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Russia chooses to launch fighters, then they&#39;ll only lose them if they enter the no fly zone, which would have clear borders in Western Ukraine. I think this would be unlikely given that the front lines would be more heavily covered by AA in this case and Ukraine has no need to</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, no guarantee on the these \u201cborders\u201d to keep Russians out, as this would also be us directly joining the war if we were to enforce it against Russian aircraft. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia would then have to choose to escalate by engaging legitimately present (according to international law) NATO air assets within Ukrainian territory which they themselves are illegally invading, in a sphere where they are heavily outmatched.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure where the source is on the legitimacy of such an intervention, but it doesn\u2019t really matter as international law means jack sh*t to Russia. The escalation would be on our part by imposing fighter patrols that can and will shoot down Russian aircraft. Russia would immediately consider NATO aircraft valid targets.

How this training will be structured (if it will be divided between basic and more advanced training after being assigned to a unit), the article does not specify.\n\n> According to NV's interlocutor in the committee, Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny strongly disagreed with some of the proposed norms:\n\n> \"He spoke out against the norm of enlisting prisoners and convicts in the army . He says: what is the army for bad people? It does not. But he also said: I need people, the Russians have already called up 400,000 and for June they are preparing several hundred thousand more, up to 400,000. Who should I fight? Either turn to the world and ask people there, or go fight if you don't provide.\"\n\n> Zaluzhnyi said, says the people's deputy, that they will try to save every life. **\"There will be 80 days of training for each conscript.

He says: what is the army for bad people? It does not. But he also said: I need people, the Russians have already called up 400,000 and for June they are preparing several hundred thousand more, up to 400,000. Who should I fight? Either turn to the world and ask people there, or go fight if you don&#39;t provide.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Zaluzhnyi said, says the people&#39;s deputy, that they will try to save every life. <strong>&quot;There will be 80 days of training for each conscript.

The first is a Reuter&#39;s special report on Sudanese refugees and the genocide they are experiencing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/sudan-politics-darfur-attacks/\">Sudan refugees detail second wave of bloody ethnic purge by Arab forces</a></p>\n\n<p>Arab-led RSF forces have pressed ahead this month with their expulsion of Sudan&#39;s ethnic-African Masalit tribe from West Darfur. Survivors described large-scale killings of Masalit captives at a soccer field and a bridge in the regional capital. As assaults mount, some fear a possible partition of the country.</p>\n\n<p>Reuters spoke to more than 70 people for this report, including civilians and Sudanese army soldiers who survived the carnage and made it to Chad. The interviews took place in Adre, at a border crossing as escapees entered Chad, and at refugee sites in the area. This account of the latest phase of the Arab forces\u2019 purge of the Masalit is based on their testimony, as well as on Reuters analysis of satellite images, photographs and social media footage of the violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second report is from the WSJ, more of the same with harrowing anecdotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/africa/the-militia-at-the-center-of-the-darfur-genocide-kills-hundreds-in-sudan-b367b9ed?mod=RSSMSN\">The Militia at the Center of the Darfur Genocide Kills Hundreds in Sudan</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Group that grew from infamous Janjaweed militia blamed for killing of about 800 people in refugee camp. \u2018I couldn\u2019t count the number of dead bodies.\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hassan Omer, a 30-year-old woman, said she and her three children cowered for much of the first day of the rampage in a hut they used as a kitchen. She said they listened to RSF fighters shouting racial slurs as they searched homes for survivors.</p>\n\n<p>Omer and her children are now in Adr\u00e9, but she has no news of her husband, who had gone out to buy food when the RSF fighters roared into the camp. \u201cI have no idea if my husband is dead or alive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut many people were killed.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Among the dead was Farsha Mohammed Arbab\u2014a prominent leader of the Masalit, one of the ethnic minorities in Darfur that has repeatedly been targeted by the ethically Arab militias spearheaded by the RSF.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

F16s are slightly more survivable than the current Ukrainian options but they are not going to be able to penetrate Russian air space to launch a deeper strike. This is not like HARM where the F16 allows the pilots to seek out targets of opportunity. These strikes are going to be planned out well before the mission is launched. The biggest advantage of these weapons being donated is simply volume. You can hit a more targets if more missiles are sent.

F16s are slightly more survivable than the current Ukrainian options but they are not going to be able to penetrate Russian air space to launch a deeper strike. This is not like HARM where the F16 allows the pilots to seek out targets of opportunity. These strikes are going to be planned out well before the mission is launched. The biggest advantage of these weapons being donated is simply volume. You can hit a more targets if more missiles are sent. It\u2019s unknown how many storm shadow/scalp missiles were sent but the Brit/French stocks were never that large so it\u2019s likely the Ukrainians are running relatively low by now.</p>\n</div>",

The use of body armor is allowing soldiers to survive blasts that would otherwise be fatal due to systemic damage. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to a blast can produce neurological consequences in the brain, but much remains unknown. To elucidate the current scientific basis for understanding blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI), the NIH convened a workshop in April, 2008\" There is a later survey at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743194/\n\nSo interest pre-dates 2019. The papers say that research on TBI is hampered by the fact that the circumstances that produce TBI also produce a variety of other injuries and stresses, making it difficult to sort out what causes what.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The paper at <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958428/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958428/</a> is dated 2010 and states &quot;Over the last few years, thousands of soldiers and an even greater number of civilians have suffered traumatic injuries due to blast exposure, largely attributed to improvised explosive devices in terrorist and insurgent activities. The use of body armor is allowing soldiers to survive blasts that would otherwise be fatal due to systemic damage. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to a blast can produce neurological consequences in the brain, but much remains unknown. To elucidate the current scientific basis for understanding blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI), the NIH convened a workshop in April, 2008&quot; There is a later survey at <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743194/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743194/</a></p>\n\n<p>So interest pre-dates 2019. The papers say that research on TBI is hampered by the fact that the circumstances that produce TBI also produce a variety of other injuries and stresses, making it difficult to sort out what causes what. However people do seem to be finding physical changes with brain scans and biochemistry. Recent interest may also be due to a new ability to learn more from these sources, as well as information gained from studies on sports related injuries.</p>\n</div>",

That's what lieutenant colonels with PhDs, and Foreign Area Offices are for. \n\nPetraeus isn't knowledgeable about this sort of warfare either, he predominantly spent most of his career in \"light\" infantry units, and his education and expertise focused HEAVILY on small wars and COIN, where he was far from the most brilliant but probably the most knowledgeable 3 star at time when they were specifically looking for a 3 star to promote to 4 star to run Iraq.

For example, any 3-4 star holding a major command would have had massive staffs in their last assignments, filling buildings up with the amount of officers and civilian DOD employees who were at their beck and call 24/7, helping with advice especially on subjects the generals weren't experts on that could include knowing facts and figures about allies, enemy, tactics, strategy, training, etc. In the US system, those level of commanders would generally not be involved much in the planning process for a major offensive until their operations staffs had already essentially written it, and then they'd really just provide input and changes, not rewrite the whole thing based on how they want to do it (which is much different from the Soviet-Russian-Ukraine system, where the commanders are heavily involved in all aspects of the planning cycle). As senior commanders, they'd not only have two aides surrounding them at all times, but they'd have a public affairs office team. Which means before anyone posts on Twitter they'd have LOTS of oversight to make sure they don't stick their d**k in a hornet's nest.

Destruction was also reported in four other districts of the city. By 3 January, the death toll from the attack in Kyiv had risen to 30, making it the bloodiest Russian strike on the Ukrainian capital since the launch of this phase of the war in February 2022. In addition, attacks were launched on Odesa (five fatalities), where the main target was the **port infrastructure**; Lviv (one civilian killed), where **weapons repair facilities** were hit; Kharkiv (three fatalities), where the Russian missiles\u2019 targets included the **Malyshev armour repair plant**; Konotop in Sumy oblast; the city of Dnipro where (seven civilians killed) and the neighbouring town of Novomoskovsk; and Zaporizhzhia city (nine fatalities), where the targets included the **Iskra factory**. Infrastructure facilities were also reported to have been hit in Selydove in Donetsk oblast, and Drohobych near Lviv. The Russians launched another attack in the afternoon of 29 December, hitting targets with rockets in Sumy city and Cherkasy oblast (one person was killed in the latter area).\n\n...\n\n\\[2 January\\]\n\nThe main target was once again Kyiv, where significant damage was caused to the **Mayak \\[weapons\\], Radiovyzmiruvach \\[aeronautical equipment and electronics\\] and Kvazar \\[integrated circuits and military hardware\\] industrial plants**. Damage of varying degrees was reported in nine areas of the city, with two civilians killed and 50 injured. Unlike previous attacks, there was widespread damage to the power grid in Kyiv and the oblast, resulting in 259,000 users being cut off from electricity in the city and a further 184,000 in the region as a whole. However, major energy infrastructure facilities were not attacked (most of the damage was caused by falling debris), allowing power supplies to be restored in less than a day. In addition to Kyiv, Russian missiles struck Kropyvnytskyi and Kharkiv. In the latter, one person was killed and 50 injured, and missiles from S-300 systems struck Kharkiv again late in the evening of 2 January.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) The [military uniforms factory M-Tac](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/01/3/7435643/) in Kyiv also reported being hit hard.

Given how inaccurate their ballistic missiles are they are very much reliant on cruise missiles to do most of the damage. As someone who has worked at military industrial complexes my entire professional career tho not in Ukraine, these facilities are huge and reinforced. You aren't going to do much unless you concentrate your missile barrages in economies of force. Using 3 very valuable and expensive cruise missiles to hit a facility that is mostly producing civilian clothing isn't going to do much for the Russian war effort. The Artem and Luch factories have been hit since the start of the war and they are still at least operational which is all the proof you need that if you really want to take them offline then you need to hit them repeatedly and with precision. I am not saying they can't do it but so far these attacks in this bombing campaign have been very inefficient.

You can hit targets quite far away in minutes, unlike sea or air launched cruise missiles which might have a flight time of 2 or 3 hours, *after* launch. The Iskander takes about 4 minutes from launch to impact, and in many cases, air alarms went off only after the explosion happened.",

There was also the awards ceremony which killed quite a few. So I don&#39;t think the precision should be called into question. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the other advantage of the Iskander. You can hit targets quite far away in minutes, unlike sea or air launched cruise missiles which might have a flight time of 2 or 3 hours, <em>after</em> launch. The Iskander takes about 4 minutes from launch to impact, and in many cases, air alarms went off only after the explosion happened.</p>\n</div>",

Recently, he restored a boat engine that had been sunk underwater for several months, its wiring stiff with mussels.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re either in the military or helping the military,\u201d Burgar said.  </p>\n\n<p>In mid-December, an explosive Shahed drone hit his shop \u2014 \u201ca present from Russia,\u201d he said. But somehow, the work continued.  </p>\n\n<p>The marines still needed boats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just how irresponsible can a journalist be with people&#39;s lives? There are at least three critical pieces of information in this paragraph that paint a bullseye on Burgar&#39;s boat shop. And next time it won&#39;t be a Shahed, but a 500-kilogram glide bomb, and the work will not continue.</p>\n</div>",
