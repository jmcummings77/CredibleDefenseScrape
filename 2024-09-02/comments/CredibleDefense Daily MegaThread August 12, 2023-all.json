                        "body": "I don't see a problem with your assessment per se expect with regards to putting Kerch Bridge attacks in that category.  Now, I believe the Moscow attacks are partially designed for an effect like that, but the majority of their strikes (as of now) will probably be planned to directly to benefit the current strategic situation, ie. first they struck the same tower twice in a row to prove it wasn't neither shot down nor a fluke in a proof-of-concept kind of a way, but within days they already struck a facility in Moscow that was either making the shell casings or filling them with explosives, or was possibly just a stockpile. Either one of these three options does show they are still trying to focus directly on the immediate war effort. We have seen evidence of quite a few failed UAV attacks over the last 6-9 months or so before they started reaching Moscow more consistently so they are obviously learning, adapting and introducing changes into their UAVs, or have a much more detailed insight into the AD capabilities still being kept in Russia proper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, if we are spitballing - my own personal theory is that they are trying to develop a relatively effective, **indigenous** response to Russian overwhelming superiority in long range capabilities. We must remember that every single long(-er) range weapon system supplied by the West apparently came with restrictions on striking targets within Russia proper, and I don't quite think Kerch Bridge falls into that category, although it's possibly murky and a point of contention in the West. We haven't seen any western supplied weapons being levied against it, but they are probably focusing on more immediate targets that will benefit the current counter offensive as well as having the advantage of being more vulnerable than the bridge itself. Or it's just a range problem for now, with Kerch Bridge being some 250 clicks from the current frontlines.\n\nNow, why I think they are definitely trying to produce their own indigenous response to Russian LR capabilities is because I can easily picture a scenario where the conflict enters a lower tempo phase in which neither side is able to muster enough offensive capabilities to significantly shift the front, but a peace treaty is nowhere in sight - they are simply that far apart in their view of the situation even now, let alone after taking additional tens of thousands of casualties and billions upon billions of dollars in damages. I do believe that in that theoretical scenario Russia will continue to perform strikes against civilian infrastructure so as to dissuade any possible return of millions of refugees as well as possibly force millions of others to flee, if only \"seasonally\" over the winter, effectively trying to render Ukraine a failed state and putting essentially an ever lingering burden on the EU. As much as the EU is not able to supply weapons and ammo as much as the US, it is currently hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees at an enormous cost that often gets overlooked. Even in this hypothetical scenario I don't see the restrictions on western supplied weapons being lifted - the primary concern of the West is avoiding a direct conventional conflict with Russia, or worse. Latter option being the more likely one if things start moving in that direction. And this is where I believe the idea behind a consistent indigenous response comes into play - if it's successful, it allows Ukrainians to at least be able to retaliate, up to a certain degree and there is likely a certain threshold of symmetry that they must attain for it to actually work, after every single missile and Shaheed strike levied against their infrastructure - this doesn't allow Russia to stay at arms length and wreck Ukraine with impunity as they have been up until relatively recently. Essentially, I believe this whole project of developing LR UAVs is aimed at securing Ukraine a better prospect at forcing Russians to the negotiating table, if everything else fails. We've seen enough evidence, arguably even in the first weeks of war, that Russia doesn't really care about the state of Eastern or Southern Ukraine nor its populace and this might be the only way they can, in theory at least, force Russia to genuinely feel that they are trapped in a true endless loop of destruction and violence unless they negotiate and give up on many of their demands.",

Latter option being the more likely one if things start moving in that direction. And this is where I believe the idea behind a consistent indigenous response comes into play - if it&#39;s successful, it allows Ukrainians to at least be able to retaliate, up to a certain degree and there is likely a certain threshold of symmetry that they must attain for it to actually work, after every single missile and Shaheed strike levied against their infrastructure - this doesn&#39;t allow Russia to stay at arms length and wreck Ukraine with impunity as they have been up until relatively recently. Essentially, I believe this whole project of developing LR UAVs is aimed at securing Ukraine a better prospect at forcing Russians to the negotiating table, if everything else fails. We&#39;ve seen enough evidence, arguably even in the first weeks of war, that Russia doesn&#39;t really care about the state of Eastern or Southern Ukraine nor its populace and this might be the only way they can, in theory at least, force Russia to genuinely feel that they are trapped in a true endless loop of destruction and violence unless they negotiate and give up on many of their demands.</p>\n</div>",

The Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics is a good journal for GNC papers. I think IEEE publishes some as well. Like any academic paper, it's going to be a bit dense if you're not familiar with model-predictive control or nonlinear control algorithms in general.\n\nIf you're looking for current applications and implementations, unfortunately it's a bit outside of my work so I haven't kept up. I know it's the Holy Grail for Amazon- they would love to have drone swarms to deliver packages semi-autonomously. They're probably at the forefront of drone swarm research these days, at least from the perspective of trying to implement it.\n\nIf you'd like an overview for laymen, here's what I'd offer:\n\nThe challenges of drone swarming are proportional to the level of autonomy you want to give each drone. I can give two examples on opposite extremes to demonstrate this.\n\nFirst consider a swarm of four drones with the intended mission of working together to lift a package that cannot be lifted alone. This is comparatively easy. One way to go about this is to assign each drone to one corner of the package, program its flight path, and have it perform the intended flight as if it were alone. The problem with this approach is that each drone will incorrectly sense its own location, and calculate flight corrections incorrectly. The drones will connect to the box at different times, so will start the flight at different times. The swarm quickly falls apart due to natural drift and the package is either dropped or never lifted.\n\nThe better solution is to designate a \"leader\" drone and and the rest as \"follower\" drones. You set up a model where drone flight corrections are based not on the intended flight path, but rather the \"follower\" drones' relative position and velocity to the \"leader\" drone. Thus the swarm stays together because only one drone is trying to achieve the actual flight path, and the rest are just trying to keep up with the leader. So only one drone actually has any autonomy.\n\nSecond example would be something like kamikaze drones. If you try the leader-follower model, you may run into a situation where the leader is disabled through electronic or physical means, or the communication between the leader and followers is severed. This destroys the whole swarm. Not ideal.\n\nSo your challenge is for each drone to be able to attack the target semi-independently without relying on a single leader. But if you go fully independent, you no longer have a swarm. It's not acting in concert with each other to maximize results. You could try a cascading leadership model where each drone is capable of assuming a leader role in some predetermined sequence, but that's more expensive and it could quickly lead to chaos. A chaotic swarm is useless.\n\nI don't know what the eventual solution will be. But these are some of the challenges that would come from using drone swarms. There's certainly a model out there that can achieve a comfortable balance, but I'm not currently aware of it. Once this challenge is overcome, I expect you'll see drones engaging in semi-autonomous roles such as \"distract\", \"strike\", \"surveil\", \"coordinate\", etc, transitioning between roles smoothly and efficiently. It'll be both glorious and utterly terrifying.",

At that point the economic tradeoff shifts in favor of the SPAAG. Faster drones, greater maneuverability, and more advanced navigation all increase the cost of the drone. At a certain point, you might as well just arm the drone or add a warhead for the amount you're spending on each unit.",

Let's start, probably, from the Tokmak direction...Fierce close-quarters battles are taking place in the area of the village of Robotyne in its northern and eastern parts. At the same time, advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are advancing east and west of this settlement...Units of the enemy's 291st Motorized Rifle Regiment (MSP) and its 1430th MSP of the Territorial Troops (TrV)... are trying to hold on to the Kopani-Robotyne border, but, judging by everything, they are not succeeding... Advanced units The Armed Forces of Ukraine have already approached the northern and northeastern outskirts of the village of Kopani... and are also waging stubborn battles on the line of strongholds between this village and the village of Robotyne... and according to certain information available to the IS group, they managed, at least , to overcome it in one place...During the past 2 days, the Armed Forces also managed to expand the area where they reached the enemy's main line of defense (in the area of the village of Verbove), advancing approximately 2 km west of it. Thus, the total area of the \"point of contact\" of the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the enemy's main line of defense is already about 4 square kilometers...Both battalions of the enemy defending in this direction (BARS-3 and BARS-14 \"Sarmat\") did not manage to prevent this and were forced to advance to the south for another couple of km. Thus, the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine get a chance to reach the village of Novoprokopivka from the north-eastern direction, simultaneously cutting off the enemy units that are still trying to hold the village of Robotyne from the enemy's tactical group, which occupied the defense area around the village of Verbove. .In this section, in connection with the above-mentioned events, the enemy command was forced to ALREADY begin the occupation of the main line of defense by troops... in particular, the following were deployed there:- units of the 1429th military infantry unit of the TRV (more precisely, what was left of it that was still operational after the battles northwest of the village of Robotyne- 2 BARS-type battalions (BARS-1 and BARS-11)- the 417th separate reconnaissance battalion (orvb) is deployed in the village of Verbove itself...The main difficulty for the enemy lies in the fact that he does not yet imagine how the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will act in the future - either they will continue to press from north to south (that is, on the village of Novoprokopivka), or they will suddenly \"depart\" through the \"point of contact\" on the village of Verbove...In the situation that is now dynamically developing in the Tokmak direction, this issue may become of key importance for the enemy to maintain the advanced positions (first line) of his entire main line of defense...If the Armed Forces break through it \"on the move\" in the area of the village of Verbove, the consequences for the enemy can be catastrophic.Yes, this has not happened yet... and the enemy is systematically trying to restrain the advanced units of the Armed Forces even BEFORE the main line of his defense system... But it is obvious that it becomes more difficult for him to do this in the Tokmak direction... Because, the number of reserves that he concentrated, for example, in the Berdyansk direction... He does not have such quantities here... ...It was this reason that became the main reason why, 2 days ago, the enemy's command began to move the 108th Airborne Assault Regiment to the Novoprokopivka area. For those who have forgotten, I will remind you that the 247th infantry fighting unit of the same division is now quite active in the area of the village of Urozhayne and the area of the village of Staromayorske... in the Berdyansk direction. Taking into account the fact that certain units of its third \"regular\" regiment, the 56th infantry division... also \"went\" in the direction of the city of Melitopol, we can state... the \"disbandment\" of the Dnipro army group in favor of the Vostok army group by the Russian command - actively continues...",

            "body": "Part 2.\n\n2. Now, actually, about the Berdyansky direction...According to certain data... the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to liberate the village of Urozhane yesterday... but I would wait for official reports on this account.In general, the situation in this direction... is developing, albeit with its own peculiarities, but in general - according to a scenario very similar to the Tokmak direction...The day before yesterday morning, it finally dawned on the Russian command in this direction that if urgent steps are not taken, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will very soon grope for the \"weak link\" in the main direction of their offensive and hit it with a sledgehammer...Therefore, a day ago, it finally decided to use part of its second echelon in this area, in order to, at least, consolidate the battle formations of the already badly damaged units of the 247th infantry brigade and the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (omsbr), which are defending in this direction. .But, as you know, the appetite comes when eating, so this reinforcement resulted not only in the advance of a part of the enemy's 136th omsbr to the area west of the village of Staramayorske from the area of the village of Staromlynivka, but also in an attempt to counter-attack the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this place with the help of this brigade to restore the position... However, to no avail.In turn, the enemy's 247th infantry division, which made exactly such an attempt a few days before, and with the same \"result\", was regrouped in the area of the village of Urozhaine... to hold it and prevent the bypass of this village from the east ...Yesterday, there was information that the Russian airborne did not cope with this task and was forced to leave the village of Urozhaine. But I would not hurry, at least for now, with a final conclusion BEFORE the official notification of the Ukrainian command...The Russian 394th ISP continues its attempts to hold the village of Priyutne, but it probably won't be able to achieve what it wants either. The Ukrainian command seems to have decided to put an end to this splinter, which the enemy firmly drove into the flank area of our offensive and blocked all attempts to pull it out from the west. The advanced units of the Armed Forces simply bypassed it from the north, and judging by everything, they will enter it as well - precisely from this direction. And in this way, the enemy's advantages in this area, which were given to him by controlling the heights southwest of the village, will be weakened...\n\nPart 3.\n\n3. Finally, a few words about the Vasylivsky direction...As far as I understand, the enemy command considers him the most \"problem-free\" for himself. Otherwise, we would have already seen its significant strengthening... But so far, this is not happening.... the movement of a battalion of Crimean \"barsiks\" into this strip is hardly possible to consider as such, although, of course, it looks quite symptomatic...The enemy's command, judging by everything, expected to maintain the situation here, precisely with that \"hodgepodge\" of units, units and formations, which it deployed here on the eve of the Ukrainian offensive in the supply lane... And until recently, it had reason to hope for this. ..But a few days ago, the advanced units of the 128th OGSHBR of the Armed Forces of Ukraine started a rather lively advance north of the village of Zherebyanka in the direction of the village of Lugove (one of the main points of the enemy's defense on the road from Kamianskoye to Vasylivka).The fact is that the enemy's 429th Infantry Division, even reinforced by battalions of Ossetian \"deer\" and local collaborators, was quite possibly able to defend itself successfully, while the Armed Forces attacked exclusively on a narrow section in the direction of the village of Pyatikhatka - the village of Zherebyanka. But as soon as the scope of activation of the Armed Forces in this direction began to grow in scope... problems began.The first \"bell\" was the change in direction of Ukrainian attacks. Instead of breaking \"head-on\" at the village of Zherebyanka along the road Orihiv - Vasylivka, the Ukrainian command shifted their direction slightly to the north-west. And it immediately became clear that it was not as easy for the enemy to hold the village of Zherebyanka as it had seemed to him before... After all, the battle formations of the 429th infantry brigade turned out to be too stretched for this.And a slight hint by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to bypass from the east the southern part of the village of Kamianske, which is still held by the enemy, generally forced the enemy to react at a \"waltz pace\"...First, the enemy pulled \"under Vasylivka\" everything he had in this direction at hand - the battalion of the 810th separate brigade of marine fur (rear MP), then another battalion from the combined tactical group of the 4th military base (VB). finally, for the sake of \"peace of mind\", a consolidated tactical group (up to 2 detachments/battalions) of the 45th separate brigade of special assignment of airborne troops (arr SpP pdv).In connection with this, a completely natural question arises - what if the advanced units of the Armed Forces in this direction add more \"width\", for example, in the direction of Nesteryanka or Myrne... what will the enemy throw in this direction?\n\nIt is not at all a fact that the story of the \"replacement\" of the 7th Assault Division (dshd) as part of the Dnipro Air Force for the \"newly formed\" 70th Motorized Rifle Division (msd), for the purpose of using the former in the Tokmak and Berdyansk directions, by the enemy's command will be able to repeat...I already wrote a couple of weeks ago that the speed at which the enemy prepares strategic reserves does not correlate at all with the dynamics of changes in the situation in key areas of the front... Scraping one MSD is not at all the same as scraping three or four such divisions...",

After all, the battle formations of the 429th infantry brigade turned out to be too stretched for this.And a slight hint by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to bypass from the east the southern part of the village of Kamianske, which is still held by the enemy, generally forced the enemy to react at a &quot;waltz pace&quot;...First, the enemy pulled &quot;under Vasylivka&quot; everything he had in this direction at hand - the battalion of the 810th separate brigade of marine fur (rear MP), then another battalion from the combined tactical group of the 4th military base (VB). finally, for the sake of &quot;peace of mind&quot;, a consolidated tactical group (up to 2 detachments/battalions) of the 45th separate brigade of special assignment of airborne troops (arr SpP pdv).In connection with this, a completely natural question arises - what if the advanced units of the Armed Forces in this direction add more &quot;width&quot;, for example, in the direction of Nesteryanka or Myrne... what will the enemy throw in this direction?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is not at all a fact that the story of the &quot;replacement&quot; of the 7th Assault Division (dshd) as part of the Dnipro Air Force for the &quot;newly formed&quot; 70th Motorized Rifle Division (msd), for the purpose of using the former in the Tokmak and Berdyansk directions, by the enemy&#39;s command will be able to repeat...I already wrote a couple of weeks ago that the speed at which the enemy prepares strategic reserves does not correlate at all with the dynamics of changes in the situation in key areas of the front... Scraping one MSD is not at all the same as scraping three or four such divisions...</p>\n</div>",

What is more likely is that the cost of these loans will be in two forms. First, joining and complying with any supranational organizations like the World Bank, IMF, etc. I think Ukraine was already a member of these orgs before, but likely post-War theyll ask for reforms in exchange for leniency on the terms of each loan. This is probably a good thing though, as it just helps Ukraine move further into the EU sphere, I doubt the IMF will asks something of them that the EU would not. Second, Ukraine's debt holders will likely look to offset their initial investments through beneficial trade agreements, especially regarding any tech industry that exists post-war, and natural resources. The challenge for everyone, but especially Ukraine, is the AG products. A core pillar of EU trade policy is supporting and subsidizing member-nation farmers. Particularly those in western Europe. A huge influx of Ukrainian grain is likely to be something French or Italian farmers would like to avoid. But its also Ukraine's most valuable export. So where does that go? Thatll be the headache. \n\nAs for bonds, Ukraine Bonds are up near 22% I think, which is pretty damn bad. By comparison, the US is at 5.5% and this is the highest weve been in probably 15 years. These war debts are going to be painful to pay off in the future, and without post-war western aid (probably in the form of a post-war IMF bailout) Ukraine is going to have a very hard time paying those wartime bonds off. But I dont think its as doom and gloom as the numbers suggest, a big chunk of the UA government is being subsidized by lower interest western bonds (Canada raised $500m for Ukraine on its bond market back last winter). Moreover, these bonds are going to get bailed out as part of postwar reconstruction, which will be necessary. If the bonds arn't, I would take that as a sign that the west is going with the 'Fuckem Plan' as opposed to the 'Marshall 2.' \n\nOverall Ukraine's postwar health is heavily tied now to whatever package the west can work up. Its in the west's interest, IMO, to rebuild Ukraine. Thats going to take a ton of cash not just for monetary reconstruction, but physical as well. Moreover the immediate post-war will be a good time to move the economy into line with countries like Poland and Romania, and to begin to implement some painful reforms to set up EU membership. End result is going to be that regardless Ukraine is in for a tough few years.

            "body": "I'd say the counteroffensive will have had limited, but worthwhile, success if they can pierce the Surovikin Line below Staromlynivka, put the train line under fire control near Zachativka, and go south from Robotyne far enough to put Tokmak in comfortable artillery range. That puts all of Zaporizhzhia in a very uncomfortable logistical position.\n\nSo in short, I don't agree with abandoning Robotyne. There are strong indications that Russian forces there are bending and may be close to breaking. Attrition is working. \n\nThat said, if they were to do it over again, I'd strongly recommend an attack south from Vuhledar, combined with an attack east from Orikhiv and south from Hulyaipole towards Polohy. I feel like Vuhledar was the softest part of the Line with already-attrited Russian forces, lower fortification density, and shortest route to a strategic target (Volnovakha). Polohy is heavily defended, but you could approach it from two axes along highways, and the Line doesn't have near as much depth as it did south of Orikhiv. The Tokmak axis is a friggin buzzsaw all the way to Melitopol. No idea why they would choose that route.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d say the counteroffensive will have had limited, but worthwhile, success if they can pierce the Surovikin Line below Staromlynivka, put the train line under fire control near Zachativka, and go south from Robotyne far enough to put Tokmak in comfortable artillery range. That puts all of Zaporizhzhia in a very uncomfortable logistical position.</p>\n\n<p>So in short, I don&#39;t agree with abandoning Robotyne. There are strong indications that Russian forces there are bending and may be close to breaking. Attrition is working. </p>\n\n<p>That said, if they were to do it over again, I&#39;d strongly recommend an attack south from Vuhledar, combined with an attack east from Orikhiv and south from Hulyaipole towards Polohy. I feel like Vuhledar was the softest part of the Line with already-attrited Russian forces, lower fortification density, and shortest route to a strategic target (Volnovakha). Polohy is heavily defended, but you could approach it from two axes along highways, and the Line doesn&#39;t have near as much depth as it did south of Orikhiv. The Tokmak axis is a friggin buzzsaw all the way to Melitopol. No idea why they would choose that route.

The strategic objective isn't a city, it's reaching the Sea of Azov to cut the Land Bridge, which means they can choose anywhere along a 160 kilometer frontage to attack. Main effort, supporting effort. Not a first main effort and second main effort, with the supporting effort on the other side of the country.\n\nThe Ukraine summer offensive was HORRIBLY planned.

Surprise attacks on Kharkiv? HIMARS? Do you think those were created for fighting insurgents? Why do the Ukrainians want ATACMS? Because they're ineffective at deep fires in this type of war?

Plan A was fast breakthroughs before the NATO summit so Zelensky could use the success as bargaining chips, with the Sea of Azov being the strategic objective, to cut the Land Bridge. That didn't work, partly because the enemy gets a vote, but not a small bit that they didn't do a good job planning and preparing for this offensive.\n\nBut when Russia botched the initial invasion, remember how many people were saying tanks were obsolete and all the rest of that crap!

The current Plan B at least might succeed in weakening the Russians enough to force them to retreat. I doubt it'll be enough to reach their ultimate goal, but enough they can claim the offensive was a Win, that's still possible. \n\nThe problem is attrition was never really a good option, it's utterly reliant on the West to support, which isn't a great idea considering how poorly the West was prepared to support this sort of war, and it's being done against a world power who is historically notorious at taking ridiculously heavy losses and persevering.",

Also worth considering that, as far as I&#39;m aware, the Ukrainians have never successfully advanced on the basis of artillery suppression in any significant engagement. They simply don&#39;t have the capability to do the kind of mass fires that it requires. Don&#39;t know to what degree they&#39;ve tried, but their success has stemmed from their artillery units&#39; ability to attrition the Russians rather than bruteforcing advances in the manner that Russia has had success with. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They shifted deep fire capabilities to tactical support last year too in Kharkiv especially, it&#39;s actually a good idea. It&#39;s part of massing, using all available resources to support the main effort. HIMARS are a corps asset in the US Army for a reason, to provide high level tactical fire support as well as deep strike operational targeting.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is not massing everything they could for the main effort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But do they have the deep pockets and supplies that the US army has? From what I&#39;ve been able to gleam from the internet, the GMLRS stockpiles don&#39;t exactly seem bottomless.</p>\n</div>",

Okay, you&#39;ll just die tired in a different location.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I&#39;ll get downvotes for saying this but it&#39;ll sell better if a top general is fired and replaced. A new strategy can&#39;t come from the same screwups that caused the last failure, it needs a new face to sell it. Ukraine has had zero change at the strategic level since the war started, it&#39;s definitely time for a change. Let someone else with a different mindset take the helm and see what they can do. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;ll never happen though...</p>\n</div>",

But he does not have any information about what is actually going on at the frontlines, he does not know what information and resources UAF possess, he does not know what information and resources RuAF possess. He does not understand the mentality of the people involved in this war to analyze their attitude and their decision-making. All he can say about UAF is that they are corrupted and inferior to US Army with some political decisions sprinkled in there somewhere. But that's a bit too shallow knowledge to be so sure about reasons behind every action UAF or RuAF had taken. He's a local US Army expert talking about a war that US are not involved in on a \"boots on the ground\" level. \n\nAs the matter of fact, one particular analogy comes to my head when I'm seeing all this discourse. From 2014 to 2022 local DNR and LNR received some Russian officers on rotation, to help them build up their 1st and 2nd Army Corpse. And I've heard a lot of complaining about it. How these guys would come and give orders straight from the University books, but locals would only laugh them off, because these orders had nothing to do with reality on the ground. Russia tried to prepare LNR\\DNR for the war by their books and in the end failed, they did not have enought men, they didn't do well building up the structure of these forces and they wasted some experienced man at the start of the war. \n\nMy point is - yes, US Army is obviously superior to UAF, as is RuAF to L\\DNR forces, but sometimes to be even greater force and gain more experience you ought to observe and listen to these small forces to see what they're doing wrong, what innovations they might introduce or how does the war of this type look like in this age and time. And I'm sure some US officials and specialists do this, but I'm not sure Duncan does. To me, he sounds like these Russian officers coming in full of superiority bravado. I'd take his word for theorycrafting, because he's good at it. But I'd only accept it with a caveat that it's only right if all his conclusions are right by all accounts, which I'm not so sure about. If Ukrainians only listened to US and did not use their brain and their people at all, they would've evacuated Zelensky out of Kyiv, and UAF would've waited for an insurgency against Russians in Carpathian mountains with those Javelins and Stingers they received. That's how good of an expert opinion US have gotten on both Ukraine's and Russia's military capabilities.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry, but no matter how well-written his posts are, they tend to go sideways sometimes with tons of sarcasm or insults. Which I get it, other people who are not as knowledgeable as him are asking the same questions and throwing the same wrong theories over and over again, and he's smart, he's tired of refuting them everytime, so he's got a bit of an attitude going on when he's on edge. That should not be acceptable though, for the sake of a good analysis that he provides, it'd be much more credible if it was a bit calmer, even when repeating some things 10 times every thread. \n\nLast thing, I'm not a military expert at all, that's the reason I'm constantly afraid to take part in discussions most of the time. And the point of this post is to not shit on Duncan, I appreciate his posts and reasonings as much as the other person on this sub. But I do know a lot about the mentality of Ukrainian people and those in UAF in particular, as my family has been a part of it for my whole lifetime. Duncan is oh so right about the general incompetence surrounding the UAF. But, they're not totally braindead, they try to get better, they just don't have enough smart people, so some corrupt idiots bound to stay in their position, because the alternative might be just as dubious. 47th Brigade is an example. The Brigade command was created from presumably young officers and they all got criticized for their shortcomings just as much.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is it's okay to doubt and criticize UAF and think about what should've been done differently, but we have to tread carefully with theorizing, because we don't know what tools they have at their disposal on the ground. Whether the decisions are right or wrong, there IS always SOME sort of logic behind them. And the same goes for Russians, by the way. I see a lot of \"stupid Russians\" and \"stupid Ukrainians\" evaluation here, which is a wrong way to look at it, in my opinion, if you want to learn something that is.",
