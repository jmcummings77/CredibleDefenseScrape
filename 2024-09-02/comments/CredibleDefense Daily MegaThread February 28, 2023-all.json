        "body": "An article on the diversification of production facilities and supply chains away from China:\n\n>[Apple Suppliers Are Racing to Exit China, AirPods Maker Says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-28/apple-suppliers-are-racing-to-exit-china-airpods-maker-says)\n\n>* GoerTek invests $280 million in a new northern Vietnam plant\n>* Tech giants want suppliers to diversify amid US-China tensions\n\n> Apple Inc.\u2019s Chinese suppliers are likely to move capacity out of the country far faster than many observers anticipate to pre-empt fallout from escalating Beijing-Washington tensions, according to one of the US company\u2019s most important partners.\n\n>AirPods maker GoerTek Inc. is one of the many manufacturers exploring locations beyond its native China, which today cranks out the bulk of the world\u2019s gadgets from iPhones to PlayStations. It\u2019s investing an initial $280 million in a new Vietnam plant while considering an India expansion, Deputy Chairman Kazuyoshi Yoshinaga said in an interview. US tech companies in particular have been pushing hard for manufacturers like GoerTek to explore alternative locations, said the executive, who oversees GoerTek\u2019s Vietnamese operations from northern Bac Ninh province.\n\n>\u201cStarting from last month, so many people from the client side are visiting us almost every day,\u201d Yoshinaga said from his offices at GoerTek\u2019s sprawling industrial complex north of Hanoi. The topic that dominates discussions: \u201cWhen can you move out?\u201d\n\n>The expanding conflict between the US and China, which began with a trade war but has since expanded to encompass sweeping bans on the exchange of chips and capital, is spurring a rethink of the electronics industry\u2019s decades-old supply chain. The world\u2019s reliance on the Asian nation became starkly clear during the Covid Zero years, when Beijing\u2019s restrictions choked off the supply of everything from phones to cars. \n\n> Apple\u2019s suppliers rarely comment on its thinking, in part because of the US company\u2019s famous insistence on secrecy across its global supply chain. \n\n> The iPhone maker has kept mum on whether it plans to diversify out of China, which would entail revamping a model Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pioneered under Steve Jobs. The US giant has been careful to avoid suggestions it might reduce its investment in China, where it\u2019s built an ecosystem centered on companies such as GoerTek and Foxconn Technology Group, which collectively employ millions.\n\n>Behind the scenes, 9 out of 10 of Apple\u2019s most important suppliers may be preparing large-scale moves to countries like India, which is dangling incentives to drive Narendra Modi\u2019s Make in India initiative. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates it could take eight years to move just 10% of Apple\u2019s capacity outside of China. \n\n>The GoerTek executive argues it\u2019ll be far quicker.\n\n> Most Chinese tech manufacturers are experiencing the same pressure. \u201cI would say currently 90% of them, they\u2019re looking at that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the brand companies\u2019 decisions.\u201d\n\n> India is high on clients\u2019 wish-lists \u2014 a reflection of its potential both as a market and a manufacturing base. \n\n>\u201cWe get requests from our clients almost every month. \u2018Do you have any plans to expand to India?\u2019\u201d Yoshinaga said. \u201cIf they decide to build up the production lines in India, we may have to think about it seriously. Currently we are focusing on developing our Vietnam production facilities.\u201d\n\n> Vietnam for now is the company\u2019s sole manufacturing site outside of China. The envisioned new 62-hectare complex in Bac Ninh will make products for major US brands and is expected to be operational within a year, Yoshinaga told Bloomberg News.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An article on the diversification of production facilities and supply chains away from China:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-28/apple-suppliers-are-racing-to-exit-china-airpods-maker-says\">Apple Suppliers Are Racing to Exit China, AirPods Maker Says</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GoerTek invests $280 million in a new northern Vietnam plant</li>\n<li>Tech giants want suppliers to diversify amid US-China tensions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Apple Inc.\u2019s Chinese suppliers are likely to move capacity out of the country far faster than many observers anticipate to pre-empt fallout from escalating Beijing-Washington tensions, according to one of the US company\u2019s most important partners.</p>\n\n<p>AirPods maker GoerTek Inc. is one of the many manufacturers exploring locations beyond its native China, which today cranks out the bulk of the world\u2019s gadgets from iPhones to PlayStations. It\u2019s investing an initial $280 million in a new Vietnam plant while considering an India expansion, Deputy Chairman Kazuyoshi Yoshinaga said in an interview. US tech companies in particular have been pushing hard for manufacturers like GoerTek to explore alternative locations, said the executive, who oversees GoerTek\u2019s Vietnamese operations from northern Bac Ninh province.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStarting from last month, so many people from the client side are visiting us almost every day,\u201d Yoshinaga said from his offices at GoerTek\u2019s sprawling industrial complex north of Hanoi. The topic that dominates discussions: \u201cWhen can you move out?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The expanding conflict between the US and China, which began with a trade war but has since expanded to encompass sweeping bans on the exchange of chips and capital, is spurring a rethink of the electronics industry\u2019s decades-old supply chain. The world\u2019s reliance on the Asian nation became starkly clear during the Covid Zero years, when Beijing\u2019s restrictions choked off the supply of everything from phones to cars. </p>\n\n<p>Apple\u2019s suppliers rarely comment on its thinking, in part because of the US company\u2019s famous insistence on secrecy across its global supply chain. </p>\n\n<p>The iPhone maker has kept mum on whether it plans to diversify out of China, which would entail revamping a model Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pioneered under Steve Jobs. The US giant has been careful to avoid suggestions it might reduce its investment in China, where it\u2019s built an ecosystem centered on companies such as GoerTek and Foxconn Technology Group, which collectively employ millions.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, 9 out of 10 of Apple\u2019s most important suppliers may be preparing large-scale moves to countries like India, which is dangling incentives to drive Narendra Modi\u2019s Make in India initiative. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates it could take eight years to move just 10% of Apple\u2019s capacity outside of China. </p>\n\n<p>The GoerTek executive argues it\u2019ll be far quicker.</p>\n\n<p>Most Chinese tech manufacturers are experiencing the same pressure. \u201cI would say currently 90% of them, they\u2019re looking at that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the brand companies\u2019 decisions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>India is high on clients\u2019 wish-lists \u2014 a reflection of its potential both as a market and a manufacturing base. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe get requests from our clients almost every month. \u2018Do you have any plans to expand to India?\u2019\u201d Yoshinaga said. \u201cIf they decide to build up the production lines in India, we may have to think about it seriously. Currently we are focusing on developing our Vietnam production facilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Vietnam for now is the company\u2019s sole manufacturing site outside of China. The envisioned new 62-hectare complex in Bac Ninh will make products for major US brands and is expected to be operational within a year, Yoshinaga told Bloomberg News. That investment will add to the $1.06 billion of commitments that GoerTek\u2019s made in Bac Ninh and the north-central province of Nghe An, he added.</p>\n\n<p>GoerTek, which also plans to manufacture virtual reality headsets in Vietnam from 2024, expects the Southeast Asian country to produce more than half of its global revenues in three years, up from one-third now, Yoshinaga said.

It could be fixed by hand, but we're talking on the order of 100 million phones. Apple's partners like Foxcon were able to train a workforce of 1000s on how to do the task, and get it completed on the scale of a couple weeks, in time for the launch.\n\nIn other words, for Apple the labor price was less critical than their ability to organize at scale at a pace that's simply impossible in the US. There's just no company in the US that could do that. You'd still be arguing the details in a conference room a month later.\n\nSecond, Apple actually owns a large portion of the manufacturing equipment used for their products, particularly the CNCs. This is again because they buy at such a huge scale they want full control of their capacity.

It could be fixed by hand, but we&#39;re talking on the order of 100 million phones. Apple&#39;s partners like Foxcon were able to train a workforce of 1000s on how to do the task, and get it completed on the scale of a couple weeks, in time for the launch.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, for Apple the labor price was less critical than their ability to organize at scale at a pace that&#39;s simply impossible in the US. There&#39;s just no company in the US that could do that. You&#39;d still be arguing the details in a conference room a month later.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Apple actually owns a large portion of the manufacturing equipment used for their products, particularly the CNCs. This is again because they buy at such a huge scale they want full control of their capacity. Apple&#39;s entire strategy revolves around these big product launches, and missing one due to a supply chain oops is their existential nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>So I mention this just as a way to point out there&#39;s concerns beyond simple labor costs at work here.

Inventories of 20%-enriched material rose to 435 kilograms from 386 kilograms.\n\n>It\u2019s the ninth consecutive quarter that Iranian engineers increased the country\u2019s volume of nuclear fuel enriched to just below the grade needed for weapons, despite suffocating US sanctions. \n\n>Tuesday\u2019s report comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the West over several overlapping crises including an effective suspension of nuclear talks with world powers, Tehran\u2019s military support for Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the Islamic Republic\u2019s deadly crackdown of widespread anti-government protests.\n\n>On Monday, a senior Iranian official said that a visit by IAEA inspectors, including Grossi, was expected in the \u201ccoming days.\u201d The government has so far dismissed concerns about its enrichment levels and said traces of 84%-enriched uranium amounted to a \u201ctechnical matter.\u201d\n\n>The UN monitors reiterated their warning that the longer Iran goes without its nuclear deal brokered by world powers, which capped its atomic work before it unraveled after the US withdrew from it in 2018, the harder it will be for the IAEA to quickly re-establish compliance.\n\n>\u201cAny future baseline for the JCPOA verification and monitoring activities would take a considerable time to establish and would have a significant degree of uncertainty,\u201d inspectors wrote, referring to the 2015 nuclear accord using its official acronym. \n\n>The agency would be prepared to work on specific arrangements with Iran, which would be indispensable to addressing this issue, the report said.\n\n>While agency monitors have full access to Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facilities, they\u2019ve lost sight over places where the fast-spinning machines that separate the metal is made.

Inventories of 20%-enriched material rose to 435 kilograms from 386 kilograms.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the ninth consecutive quarter that Iranian engineers increased the country\u2019s volume of nuclear fuel enriched to just below the grade needed for weapons, despite suffocating US sanctions. </p>\n\n<p>Tuesday\u2019s report comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the West over several overlapping crises including an effective suspension of nuclear talks with world powers, Tehran\u2019s military support for Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the Islamic Republic\u2019s deadly crackdown of widespread anti-government protests.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, a senior Iranian official said that a visit by IAEA inspectors, including Grossi, was expected in the \u201ccoming days.\u201d The government has so far dismissed concerns about its enrichment levels and said traces of 84%-enriched uranium amounted to a \u201ctechnical matter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The UN monitors reiterated their warning that the longer Iran goes without its nuclear deal brokered by world powers, which capped its atomic work before it unraveled after the US withdrew from it in 2018, the harder it will be for the IAEA to quickly re-establish compliance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAny future baseline for the JCPOA verification and monitoring activities would take a considerable time to establish and would have a significant degree of uncertainty,\u201d inspectors wrote, referring to the 2015 nuclear accord using its official acronym. </p>\n\n<p>The agency would be prepared to work on specific arrangements with Iran, which would be indispensable to addressing this issue, the report said.</p>\n\n<p>While agency monitors have full access to Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facilities, they\u2019ve lost sight over places where the fast-spinning machines that separate the metal is made. That absence of oversight leaves open the possibility that Iran could be diverting centrifuges to an undeclared location.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Political leaders have encountered unanticipated resistance within their own coalitions, and even from their defense ministries.

When Russia launched the largest land war on the continent since World War II, they were woefully unprepared.\n> \n> Hints of the problem have surfaced repeatedly since Russia invaded Ukraine a year ago, through shortages of weapons and ammunition. But now, as Germany and its allies struggled for weeks to scrape together enough Leopard 2s to fill two battalions of tanks \u2014 62 vehicles in total \u2014 the extent of their quandary has become even clearer.\n> \n> The irony of this situation is not lost on Germany.\n> \n> For weeks, Chancellor Olaf Scholz resisted an intense public pressure campaign from Ukraine\u2019s leaders, European politicians and security experts to supply Kyiv with tanks, and to permit other nations to send some of their own Leopards, despite German concerns that it could be perceived by Russia as a NATO escalation. Many goaded Mr. Scholz with a social media campaign: #Freetheleopards.\n> \n> The Leopards may be free now, but they are scarce on the ground. And some countries that clamored for permission to send them to Ukraine are having difficulties doing so, or second thoughts of their own.\n> \n> Despite Europe having an estimated 2,000 Leopard 2 tanks of different models \u2014 they are among the most commonly used main battle tanks across the continent \u2014 pledges for Ukraine are still short of the hundreds it says it needs.\n> \n> Germany has offered 18, and Poland another 14, but the numbers drop from there.

It is not so much that nations are unwilling to make good on their promises but rather that they have faced a rude awakening as to just how difficult it is.\n> \n> Finland, where many outspoken members of Parliament led the calls for Germany to allow Leopard deliveries, announced on Thursday that it would supply three Leopard mine-clearing vehicles \u2014 but none of its estimated 200 Leopard main battle tanks.\n> \n> Some German officials expressed sympathy for Finland, which is not yet a NATO member and has Europe\u2019s longest border with Russia, some 830 miles. It does not want to weaken its defenses now that Russia has shown a willingness to attack a sovereign neighbor.\n> \n> But some European officials were hoping for a larger contribution from Finland, given promises from the United States and Britain to come to its defense if necessary, even before NATO accession.\n> \n> Nordic countries such as Sweden, which had long pushed for Leopard deliveries but on Friday offered only \u201cup to\u201d 10, are facing another unexpected problem, several German officials said: While their politicians and members of the public appear keen to offer tanks to Ukraine, their militaries are not.\n> \n> For decades, European countries enjoying a post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d had seen war as almost a thing of the past, regularly cutting military support. Now, the shrunken armies tend to be protective of what they still have. At NATO, European militaries are sometimes called \u201cbonsai armies,\u201d after the miniature trees.\n> \n> For years, the United States has been nagging Europe to increase military spending, and in 2014, after Russia grabbed Crimea, NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Yet even today, by current NATO estimates, only nine of the alliance\u2019s 30 members are spending that much, while a 10th is close. Thirteen countries, including Germany, were spending around 1.5 percent of their G.D.P. or even less.\n> \n> In Germany, which for years clung to a foreign policy that emphasized aid and development more than hard power, some saw the problem as uniquely German. Yearly military reports to Parliament offered sometimes comical glimpses of the shortages. Commandos conducted water training at local public pools, because their own facilities were shut down. Planes could not fly. Soldiers trained with broomsticks instead of rifles. Even newer Puma infantry fighting vehicles recently broke down en masse.\n> \n> But other European nations are now realizing their own militaries may have similar troubles.\n> \n> \u201cThe trend across the board in European armies has been cutting, cutting, cutting,\u201d  said Christian M\u00f6lling, a defense expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut at the end of the day, many were on the same track as Germany: War is a theoretical thing.

Like Berlin, Warsaw has some 200 Leopard 2 tanks \u2014 but it says it will provide just 14. It sent the first of the tanks to Ukraine on the anniversary of the invasion, Feb. 24, although Poland has yet to finish training Ukrainian soldiers how to use them.\n> \n> Warsaw may be holding off on deliveries of Leopards until it receives new Hyundai-made K2 tanks from South Korea, meant to replace the German model, some analysts said. Poland has sent many upgraded Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukraine.\n> \n> But some European officials think Warsaw should be offering more Leopards, and some policymakers are planning meetings with Polish officials this week to better understand the situation. Even when it comes to the tanks that are in large supply \u2014 namely, the older Leopard 1 models \u2014 there are complications.\n> \n> The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have launched a joint initiative to refurbish and send 150 Leopard 1 models to Ukraine by the end of the year. But at a training session for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany earlier this week, one general said militaries had been forced to seek out retired Leopard 1 tank drivers to come back and help train Ukrainian forces. The old model is too unfamiliar to current militaries.\n> \n> As politicized as the Leopard issue has become, Gustav Gressel, a security analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that there were plenty of solutions if European nations worked together.\n> \n> The Dutch, for instance, lease 18 Leopards from Germany. Officials are discussing whether it would be possible for Germany to take some of them to use in place of its own Leopards in Lithuania and then send those to Ukraine.\n> \n> Switzerland, sticking to its constitutional neutrality, refuses to send any of its 134 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. But it is willing to give the tanks to European Union members, Mr. Gressel said. Countries like Finland or Poland, he said, could request the Swiss tanks and send their own to Ukraine.\n> \n> Another option would be for countries to simply buy more Leopards, made by the German companies Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, and send their current models to Ukraine.

        "body": ">[China\u2019s Imports of Russian Uranium Spark Fear of New Arms Race](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-01/china-nuclear-trade-with-russia-risks-tipping-military-balance)\n\n>Russian nuclear fuel deliveries to a new Chinese reactor are raising US concerns about the potential to produce weapons-grade plutonium. \n\n> On the same day in December when Chinese and US diplomats said they\u2019d held constructive talks to reduce military tensions, Russian engineers were delivering a massive load of nuclear fuel to a remote island just 220 kilometers (124 miles) off Taiwan\u2019s northern coast. \n\n>China\u2019s so-called fast-breeder reactor on Changbiao Island is one of the world\u2019s most closely-watched nuclear installations. US intelligence officials forecast that when it begins working this year, the CFR-600 will produce weapons-grade plutonium that could help Beijing increase its stockpile of warheads as much as four-fold in the next 12 years. That would allow China to match the nuclear arsenals currently deployed by the US and Russia.\n\n>> \u201cIt is entirely possible that this breeder program is purely civilian,\u201d said Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based nuclear analyst with the United Nations\u2019s Institute for Disarmament Research. \u201cOne thing that makes me nervous is that China stopped reporting its civilian and separated plutonium stockpiles. It\u2019s not a smoking gun but it\u2019s definitely not a good sign.\u201d\n\n> China\u2019s burgeoning capacity to expand its atomic weaponry comes as the last remaining treaty limiting the strategic stockpiles of the US and Russia is on the verge of collapse amid spiraling confrontation over the war in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin announced Feb. 21 that Russia is suspending its involvement in the New START agreement, a decision US President Joe Biden condemned as a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d\n\n>In a Dec. 30 videoconference, Putin told Chinese President Xi Jinping that defense and military technology cooperation \u201chas a special place\u201d in their relations. \n\n>\u201cClearly, China is benefiting from Russian support,\u201d said Hanna Notte, a German arms-control expert. The risk for Beijing is the US may expand its own stockpile in response to China\u2019s build-up as well as the Kremlin\u2019s abrogation of arms-control treaties and \u201cthe discrepancy will just grow again,\u201d she said.\n\n>US Department of Defense officials have repeatedly raised alarm over China\u2019s nuclear-weapons ambitions since issuing a 2021 report to Congress. Military planners assess that the CFR-600 is poised to play a critical role in raising China\u2019s stockpile of warheads to 1,500 by 2035 from an estimated 400 today. \n\n> Pentagon officials say Russian state-owned Rosatom Corp.\u2019s Dec. 12 supply of 6,477 kilograms (14,279 pounds) of uranium is fueling an atomic program that could destabilize Asia\u2019s military balance, where there are growing tensions over Taiwan and control of the South China Sea. China possesses few means to increase its plutonium stockpile for nuclear weapons after its original production program closed down in the 1990s, experts say. \n\n> China rejects the US\u2019s concerns. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said China \u201cstrictly fulfilled its nuclear non-proliferation obligations\u201d and voluntarily submitted \u201cpart of civil nuclear activities\u201d to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Defense Ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said in a Feb. 23 briefing the US repeatedly hyped up the \u201cChina nuclear threat\u201d as an excuse to expand its own strategic arsenal, while China maintained a defensive policy that includes no first-use of nuclear weapons. \n\n> US protests didn\u2019t dissuade China National Nuclear Corp. from taking delivery of fuel from Rosatom for the CFR-600 reactor, which is based on a Russian design using liquid metal instead of water to moderate operation. Exclusive trade data showing details of the transaction was provided to Bloomberg by the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank. \n\n>The expanding nuclear partnership between Russia and China is having a huge impact on non-proliferation efforts. Between September and December, the RUSI data show Russia exported almost seven times as much highly-enriched uranium to China for the CFR-600 as all the material removed worldwide under US and IAEA auspices in the last three decades.\n\n>China paid about $384 million in three installments for 25,000 kilograms of CFR-600 fuel from Rosatom in that period, according to the RUSI data, which is sourced from a third-party commercial provider and based on Russian customs records. \n\n>Rosatom declined to comment. The project \u201cwill become the first nuclear power plant with a high-capacity fast reactor outside of Russia,\u201d Rosatom\u2019s TVEL Fuel Company said in a Dec. 28 statement confirming delivery of fuel.\n\n>Highly-enriched uranium, defined as the presence of uranium-235 isotopes refined to greater than 20% purity, is a strictly-controlled metal that only a few countries manufacture or possess. The higher the level of enrichment, the closer the suitability for use in weapons, and eliminating the international trade in highly-enriched uranium has been a central pillar of non-proliferation policy since the 1990s.\n\n> The CFR-600 is part of China\u2019s ambitious $440 billion program to overtake the US as the world\u2019s top nuclear-energy provider by the middle of next decade. Unlike traditional light-water reactors it runs on a combination of highly-enriched uranium and so-called mixed-oxide fuel that yields weapons-usable plutonium as a byproduct. \n\n>China is also building a desert factory in Gansu province designed to extract plutonium from the CFR-600\u2019s spent fuel, once construction is finished in two years. Beijing ceased voluntarily reporting plutonium stockpiles to the IAEA since 2017.\n\n> \u201cThe increasing secrecy and strong diplomatic efforts against providing greater transparency have raised international suspicion,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a visiting research scholar at Princeton University\u2019s Science and Global Security Program. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can rule out the potential military use.\u201d \n\n>December\u2019s high-level diplomatic meeting between senior US and Chinese officials in Langfang, a city neighboring China\u2019s capital, was intended to pave the way for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s first official visit as part of efforts to ease tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. \n\n>But tensions spiked again after Blinken\u2019s trip was canceled in February in response to the alleged Chinese surveillance balloon over US airspace that Biden ordered shot down by a warplane. At a security conference in Munich, China\u2019s top diplomat, Wang Yi, blasted the US reaction as \u201chysterical\u201d while Blinken warned Beijing not to supply lethal weapons to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. \n\n>The danger now is that tit-for-tat recriminations between Beijing and Washington take a nuclear turn once the CFR-600 starts operating, enabling the potential production of plutonium for weapons in years ahead. \n\n> \u201cPreviously, China had limited itself to what it called \u2018minimum nuclear deterrence.\u2019 This potential was much inferior to the American one,\u201d a Russian arms-control expert, Alexei Arbatov, said in a Feb. 6 commentary for the Kremlin-founded Russian International Affairs Council. \u201cBut then, apparently, the Chinese decided to match the United States (and, by default, Russia) in terms of the number and quality of nuclear forces.\u201d\n\n>Russia has grown increasingly dependent on China since Putin\u2019s year-old invasion of Ukraine prompted unprecedented international sanctions. China has shown it has little intention of abandoning its staunch diplomatic partner against their common US adversary, even as Beijing portrays itself as a neutral actor over the war. \n\n> As part of the five-member club of official nuclear-weapons states codified under the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty, China and Russia don\u2019t have to report details that might help verify whether the CFR-600 is being used to boost Beijing\u2019s weapons stockpile. The site isn\u2019t subject to mandatory IAEA monitoring, requiring the Pentagon and arms-control analysts to make assumptions about its purpose.\n\n> Frank von Hippel, a physicist and former White House adviser now at Princeton University, figures the CFR-600 could produce as many as 50 warheads a year once it\u2019s up and running. \u201cI would expect the enrichment in the HEU for the CFR-600 to be less than 30% - still weapon usable,\u201d even if lower on the spectrum of highly-enriched material, he wrote in an emailed reply to questions.\n\n>\u201cFor China, getting the technology and fuel is important,\u201d because there aren\u2019t many places where it can obtain plutonium and Russia won\u2019t object if the heavy-metal is used for nuclear weapons, said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cWhatever is bad for the US and whenever you can strengthen American competitors, is viewed now as a good thing for Russia.\u201d\n\nCombine this story with the WSJ one from earlier this month:\n\n>[China Has More ICBM Launchers Than U.S., American Military Reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-has-more-icbm-launchers-than-u-s-american-military-reports-11675779463)\n\nMore launchers, and now more potential warheads.",

        "body": "Key points of a [recent interesting interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoKJhgQJNA) (made in February 25) of Kyrylo Budanov, Chief of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine:\n\nRussia hasn't completed any of its main strategic objectives since the invasion began. \n\nThere were many thoughts if Russia would indeed invade in February 2022 but in the end there were steps taken to increase the defense of the country. An example he made is that Ukraine moved its airforce out of its bases prior to February 23 expecting the invasion. And the looses of aviation were minimal in February 24th.\n\nAsked about the reasons behind the successful defense of the country, he replied that the will of the people was the main reason. He said that the Russians compare this war to their Great Patriotic war, giving it an existential character, but indeed this war is the Great Patriotic war for the Ukrainians.\n\nTo make any breakthrough in the conflict, Ukraine needs the increase of delivery of Western weapons. In particular, he said that the increase of quantity of deliveries is preferred over the deliveries of new weapon systems that haven't made to Ukraine. He mentioned that Ukraine needs planes, and specifically \"storm aviation\" that can hit ground targets such as A-10s and AH-64s and not F16s that are being discussed. He said that its his personal opinion and other advisors to the President have other opinions.\n\nHe said that the Russians have not started their big offensive yet.\n\nThe Russians have decreased the frequency of using long range missiles to hit Ukrainian targets as well as the number of missiles used per wave. Probably because the stocks are running out.\n\nHe doesn't believe that China will supply Russia with weapons. He actually thinks even that there are no such discussions between China and Russia.\n\nThe only country supplying weapons to Russia is Iran. Rumors that N. Korea supplied weapons to Russia have not yet been true based on evidence in the battlefield (he doesn't exclude however seeing such ammunition in the future). Russia hoped for Serbia to supply them weapons but Serbia refused. There are diplomatic efforts to import weapons through third countries but so far they were unfruitful for Russia. Russia tries to get some weapons from Myanmar currently.\n\nRussia cannot openly admit that they are loosing. The stability of the Kremlin's regime relies in that fact. There are different views in the Kremlin about the continuation or not of the war because they have realised some facts and that they could possibly could not win in the end but still many advocate for the continuation of the war mainly because if they loose, they are afraid of the consequences and taking the responsibility of the defeat, only when they will be put in the corner they will realise what is happening.\n\nThe war will only end after the recapture of all territories as they were internationally recognised to the borders of 91'. If such will not be the case, then the war will not stop and any ceasefire will not be accepted by the political leadership of Ukraine. \n\nRussia is not prepared to fight a long-term war. Their resources and time to fight is limited and they know it, no matter how much propaganda they put out in the public.\n\nDuring the next 3 months there will be a lot of activity in the the battlefield that will shape the future of this war. This activity will be everywhere, in the South and East. He has no evidence of plans to invade Kyiv from Belarus possible because there aren't any.\n\nHe mentions that one of the most important aspects of cooperation with Western partners are UAV reconnaissance drones.\n\nHe believes that all the geopolitical threats as perceived by Russia were increased due to their stupid decision to invade. The countries of Eastern Europe perceive the Russia as a threat but that opinion is not shared by many countries of the Western Europe. Only if Russia invaded the Eastern European countries, it would be seen as a threat as it was during the Warsaw Pact. In addition, Russia has been kicked out of the global weapons supplier markets because of Ukraine. Furthermore, most of its skilled officers were lost during the first year of the war, the mobilised troops cannot be compared to the tactical army that Russia had prior to the Feb24 invasion. \n\nRegarding the possibilities of dissolution of Russia into more independent states, he believes that the sooner they will leave Ukraine, the more chances they get to keep their integrity. Russia could become more of a Federation because they are currently called a Federation but in fact they act more like a unitary state.\n\nEven if Ukraine wins the war and Russia will change its attitude towards Ukraine, preferring peaceful relations and trade, Ukraine will still transform into an Israel-like state, this will be the result not of realistic facts but of the image and perception of Russia by the citizens of Ukraine as an existential treat. Ukrainians will ask for security above everything else and such will be the policies followed by the elected officials. \n\nPolitical elections during wartime will not be held as they are also illegal. Budanov doesn't plan running for office.\n\nAround 2,000 have been returned during prisoner's exchanges. Ukraine consulted with many western partners to provide them advise about how these exchanges must be held, but there weren't much advices provided because the nations hadn't had much experience in prisoner's exchange during active wartime operations. He said that many times Ukraine had to force Russia to return the prisoners by using coercive methods without providing any details. Russia has more prisoners of war than Ukraine, 90% of whom were captured during the first days of the invasion. 40% of the captured prisoners by Russia are civilians. Ukraine doesn't capture civilians.\n\nAll measures have been implemented to secure the prisoners including the pope Francis as a mediator.\n\nRegarding the change of leadership in Moldova, Budanov mentioned that the new leadership (Dorin Recean) of Moldova comes from the silovii block (or block of people strength) and it is highly professional. Moldova realised that Russia was planning a coup to overthrow the constitutionally elected government. Measures were taken to prevent the coup and it seems that they will work and Russia's plans will fail.\n\nRegarding the usage of nuclear weapons if Ukraine tries to get Crimea by force, he mentioned that Russia has used this treat a lot of times so far with no practical implementation. He doesn't think that Russia is run by crazy people and that they fully recognise the consequences of nuclear weapons usage. The political leadership of Russia acknowledge that nuclear weapons are not made to be used in the battlefield but used as a strategic tool of prevention (he also mentions that during the cold war nuclear weapons were never used for the same reasons). The offensive usage of nuclear weapons will have many negative consequences for the offender.\n\nAbout how he views this war will end, Budanov believes that the first stage of the war will end by recapturing all occupied territory. The second stage of the war will result in many regional economic and security related changes, in particular towards Russia. He also believes that a (at least) 100km demilitarised zone must be created (without mentioning if the zone will be created in Russia or in both countries).",

If they're going to have to fight a meat grinder urban battle somewhere, it might as well be somewhere that is already economically devastated and depopulated, rather than a relatively intact city. \n\nTheir secondary defensive lines are in similar terrain and thus aren't any easier to defend than Bakhmut. The increased distance from Russian supply bases isn't sufficient to add significant strain to their logistics. So the Ukrainians can fight where they are now, or they can fight the same battle 20-30km west of where they are now. The only difference is the Russians get a little more land, a (frankly pathetic) propaganda win, and the opportunity to shell previously undisturbed civilian infrastructure around Kromatorsk or Slovyansk. \n\nI do think the Ukrainians' primary motivation is to humiliate Putin, though.

If they&#39;re going to have to fight a meat grinder urban battle somewhere, it might as well be somewhere that is already economically devastated and depopulated, rather than a relatively intact city. </p>\n\n<p>Their secondary defensive lines are in similar terrain and thus aren&#39;t any easier to defend than Bakhmut. The increased distance from Russian supply bases isn&#39;t sufficient to add significant strain to their logistics. So the Ukrainians can fight where they are now, or they can fight the same battle 20-30km west of where they are now. The only difference is the Russians get a little more land, a (frankly pathetic) propaganda win, and the opportunity to shell previously undisturbed civilian infrastructure around Kromatorsk or Slovyansk. </p>\n\n<p>I do think the Ukrainians&#39; primary motivation is to humiliate Putin, though.

The Russians have long ago and identified and exploited weak points, and the more they progress, the weaker the weak points become for the Ukrainians. Hence the reason there seems to be exponential success since mid January, because the actual defense was already cracked, this is really only the mop up phase. \n\nThe only reason to remain in Bakhmut at this point that makes any sort of tactical or operational sense would be because the phased withdrawal is still ongoing (which points to issues having waited too long to execute it), or that the defensive positions west of the city haven't actually been prepared in advance (which means a major planning screwup).",

None of the positions would have suffered much if any damage due to to months of heavy fires either. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the better fixed defenses around Bakhmut were overrun some time ago, most defenses occupied now are hasty, designated and manned on the spur of the moment while needing to adjust to Russian unexpected successes (like flanking attacks threatening to cut off the city&#39;s supply lines). The Russians have long ago and identified and exploited weak points, and the more they progress, the weaker the weak points become for the Ukrainians. Hence the reason there seems to be exponential success since mid January, because the actual defense was already cracked, this is really only the mop up phase. </p>\n\n<p>The only reason to remain in Bakhmut at this point that makes any sort of tactical or operational sense would be because the phased withdrawal is still ongoing (which points to issues having waited too long to execute it), or that the defensive positions west of the city haven&#39;t actually been prepared in advance (which means a major planning screwup).</p>\n</div>",

And this is absolutely critical because such an attack will be extremely favorable for the Russians. Where does UAF defend along that axis? Maybe they can put up a stand just north of Pryvillya? If Russia is forced to attack from jumping off points further east, at least the UAF can defend on parallel ridge after parallel ridge. Plus they've been planning defenses on that axis since 2015. If Russia is forced to attack from jumping off points to the north, at least UAF can defend along the Siverskyi Donets river. The Bakhmut-Sloviansk axis looks like the worst axis for the UAF to defend, and the most favorable for the Russians to attack along. They very well could face a situation where the next position they can hold for any length of time is right in front of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. \n\nRussian pressure and then progress attacking along that axis could easily unglue the defenses of all of northern Donetsk. Possession of Bakhmut, even if encircled and basically combat ineffective, makes such an attack unfeasible. We know encircled UAF forces can hang on to urban terrain for weeks.

It is conducted, as a rule, when there are insufficient forces and means available to conduct a positional defense.*\n[source](https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2021/Spring/2Grau_Bartles21.pdf)\n\nIt made a comeback in the late 80s. Now it's go to Russian doctrine (though they don't do it that well in this war). The Russians used it in Kharkiv oblast during May-June, and Kherson oblast Sep-Nov.\n\n> I do believe we'll see these issues lessen as the war goes on and the UAF command learns from its past battles, evolves its command structure, and absorbs more Western thinking & training. \n\nRUSI said the UAF wanted to do a maneuver defense in the Donbas but were denied in order to save Ukrainian non-combatants from ending up in Russian occupied territory. I think it's a bullshit answer, totally fabricated, but regardless of why let's look at where else and when, which would everywhere and the whole war. So it's a universal strategic policy that is a blanket rule for the entirety of Ukraine, it has to be an order emanating from Kyiv, either Zelensky or Zaluzhnyi. Nobody else can be responsible, those are the only two individuals who have the authority to make that decision.\n\n>And my argument is that Bakhmut may just be one of those situations. Ukrainian possession of that town, in my opinion, fatally weakens any potential further Russian attack NW towards Sloviansk.\n\nIf Bakhmut was that important, the UA govt and General Staff ought to have done what was necessary to hold it, which means not only commiting more than what they did until mid January to \"hold at all costs\" positionally, but they should have counterattacked significantly, as in division sized or bigger, back in the fall to retake the high ground east of the city that they lost the previous spring through summer. \n\nBut they didn't do that, wouldn't commit the resources because Bakhmut wasn't important enough. Instead they stayed the course, likely because up until late December and definitely into January, they thought they were winning. By the time they realized they weren't, they seemed to have pulled the plug on support. \n\n>Where does UAF defend along that axis?\n\nAfter losing Bakhmut, the next defendable terrain feature is the high ground between the Bakhmutka River valley that Bakhmut sits in and the Kazennyi Torets River that Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka all sit in.\n\n>They very well could face a situation where the next position they can hold for any length of time is right in front of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. \n\nOr they don't defend anymore and go on the attack. But let's be realistic, they won't choose that sector for a large scale offensive because it's not important enough.\n\nAnd that's the problem. They're defending everything as if everything is Kyiv. But it's not. If it's not actually important enough to launch an attack, then it's not important enough to defend at all cost. \n\nThe idea that offense automatically equals more casualties than defense is untrue. I won't suggest Kharkiv proved otherwise because that was a fluke situation caused by incompetence and manning issues the Russians fixed. But I mean that there are times when defending is bad, specifically when being actively outflanked. Then defending only means they keep catching punches to the side of the head. \"Rope-a-Dope\" only works when the punches aren't actually landing and breaking the fighter's nose, jaw, eye socket, and ribs. Same goes for defending.\n\n>Might Russia have the capability to keep driving north on the M03 axis once Bakhmut is secured?\n\nRussians need roads for their tactical but especially operational rear for resupply, so their tactical advance must generally follow roads. But they don't need to follow any specific road unless there are no others. Also, to follow that road means crossing the heights beyond Pryvillya, no easy task. \n\n>Where do you imagine the UAF could set up to check such a drive?\n\nThat whole ridge. But if they really want to check the drive, do counterattacks. \n\n>Would Russian success along this axis necessitate the abandonment or possible encirclement of Siversk and all territory east of the M03\n\nIf they take that high ground, probably. Though if they contribute any more units to attack NE in conjunction with existing attacks SW from Kreminna, that might happen. \n\n>Imagining that the danger described above is real, do you still believe that holding Bakhmut despite the possible destruction of its garrison is incorrect? \n\nI don't think the entire UAF defense of the Donbas was done well. But, assuming maneuver/mobile defense is out, I still think they botched the defense of Bakhmut, because the flanks collapsed entirely too easily/quickly starting in late December, and if the city was so critical and those flanks so important they should have been ready to deal with that.\n\nMonths ago, back in ~November when Bakhmut first started getting lots of news and every third question on this sub was asking why attack Bakhmut or would it fall, my answer to the latter was \"only if Hell froze over\" because I couldn't see it happening. A frontal assault through the city would be too costly, and flanking attacks around the city would be too vulnerable to counterattacks to lop off the vulnerable salients like these:\n\n[Day 302](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_bakhmut/day_302_Bakhmut-Front.jpg)\n[Day 310](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_bakhmut/day_310_Bakhmut-Front_b.jpg)\n[Day 342](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_bakhmut/day_342_Bakhmut-Front2.jpg)\n\nWhere were the brigades ready to counterattack those salients in strength? They had enough to continuously rotate units in static positions so everyone got a chance to eat artillery and attacks and get ground up that way, but not enough to hit hasty Russian positions in force? \n\nBecause a decision was made by generals how to defend, and the way they chose favored Russian tactics, their operational plan, and their existing strategic strengths.\n\nAnother boxing metaphor: if my opponent is an out of shape power puncher I don't stand in front of him and trade hooks. An MMA metaphor: if my opponent is a BJJ expert who can't strike for shit, I don't clinch because then I'll end up getting choked or tapped out, I keep the fight on our feet and maintain distance.",

The Russians used it in Kharkiv oblast during May-June, and Kherson oblast Sep-Nov.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do believe we&#39;ll see these issues lessen as the war goes on and the UAF command learns from its past battles, evolves its command structure, and absorbs more Western thinking &amp; training. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>RUSI said the UAF wanted to do a maneuver defense in the Donbas but were denied in order to save Ukrainian non-combatants from ending up in Russian occupied territory. I think it&#39;s a bullshit answer, totally fabricated, but regardless of why let&#39;s look at where else and when, which would everywhere and the whole war. So it&#39;s a universal strategic policy that is a blanket rule for the entirety of Ukraine, it has to be an order emanating from Kyiv, either Zelensky or Zaluzhnyi. Nobody else can be responsible, those are the only two individuals who have the authority to make that decision.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And my argument is that Bakhmut may just be one of those situations. Ukrainian possession of that town, in my opinion, fatally weakens any potential further Russian attack NW towards Sloviansk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If Bakhmut was that important, the UA govt and General Staff ought to have done what was necessary to hold it, which means not only commiting more than what they did until mid January to &quot;hold at all costs&quot; positionally, but they should have counterattacked significantly, as in division sized or bigger, back in the fall to retake the high ground east of the city that they lost the previous spring through summer. </p>\n\n<p>But they didn&#39;t do that, wouldn&#39;t commit the resources because Bakhmut wasn&#39;t important enough. Instead they stayed the course, likely because up until late December and definitely into January, they thought they were winning. By the time they realized they weren&#39;t, they seemed to have pulled the plug on support. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where does UAF defend along that axis?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After losing Bakhmut, the next defendable terrain feature is the high ground between the Bakhmutka River valley that Bakhmut sits in and the Kazennyi Torets River that Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka all sit in.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They very well could face a situation where the next position they can hold for any length of time is right in front of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or they don&#39;t defend anymore and go on the attack. But let&#39;s be realistic, they won&#39;t choose that sector for a large scale offensive because it&#39;s not important enough.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s the problem. They&#39;re defending everything as if everything is Kyiv. But it&#39;s not. If it&#39;s not actually important enough to launch an attack, then it&#39;s not important enough to defend at all cost. </p>\n\n<p>The idea that offense automatically equals more casualties than defense is untrue. I won&#39;t suggest Kharkiv proved otherwise because that was a fluke situation caused by incompetence and manning issues the Russians fixed. But I mean that there are times when defending is bad, specifically when being actively outflanked. Then defending only means they keep catching punches to the side of the head. &quot;Rope-a-Dope&quot; only works when the punches aren&#39;t actually landing and breaking the fighter&#39;s nose, jaw, eye socket, and ribs. Same goes for defending.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Might Russia have the capability to keep driving north on the M03 axis once Bakhmut is secured?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russians need roads for their tactical but especially operational rear for resupply, so their tactical advance must generally follow roads. But they don&#39;t need to follow any specific road unless there are no others. Also, to follow that road means crossing the heights beyond Pryvillya, no easy task. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where do you imagine the UAF could set up to check such a drive?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That whole ridge. But if they really want to check the drive, do counterattacks. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would Russian success along this axis necessitate the abandonment or possible encirclement of Siversk and all territory east of the M03</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they take that high ground, probably. Though if they contribute any more units to attack NE in conjunction with existing attacks SW from Kreminna, that might happen. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagining that the danger described above is real, do you still believe that holding Bakhmut despite the possible destruction of its garrison is incorrect? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think the entire UAF defense of the Donbas was done well. But, assuming maneuver/mobile defense is out, I still think they botched the defense of Bakhmut, because the flanks collapsed entirely too easily/quickly starting in late December, and if the city was so critical and those flanks so important they should have been ready to deal with that.</p>\n\n<p>Months ago, back in ~November when Bakhmut first started getting lots of news and every third question on this sub was asking why attack Bakhmut or would it fall, my answer to the latter was &quot;only if Hell froze over&quot; because I couldn&#39;t see it happening. A frontal assault through the city would be too costly, and flanking attacks around the city would be too vulnerable to counterattacks to lop off the vulnerable salients like these:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_bakhmut/day_302_Bakhmut-Front.jpg\">Day 302</a>\n<a href=\"https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_bakhmut/day_310_Bakhmut-Front_b.jpg\">Day 310</a>\n<a href=\"https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_bakhmut/day_342_Bakhmut-Front2.jpg\">Day 342</a></p>\n\n<p>Where were the brigades ready to counterattack those salients in strength? They had enough to continuously rotate units in static positions so everyone got a chance to eat artillery and attacks and get ground up that way, but not enough to hit hasty Russian positions in force? </p>\n\n<p>Because a decision was made by generals how to defend, and the way they chose favored Russian tactics, their operational plan, and their existing strategic strengths.</p>\n\n<p>Another boxing metaphor: if my opponent is an out of shape power puncher I don&#39;t stand in front of him and trade hooks. An MMA metaphor: if my opponent is a BJJ expert who can&#39;t strike for shit, I don&#39;t clinch because then I&#39;ll end up getting choked or tapped out, I keep the fight on our feet and maintain distance.</p>\n</div>",

Remaining in them while they are being outflanked or actively encircled doesn't.\n\nFor example, let's say someone uses a large river as a defensive line. But then part of it is breached. And then the enemy breakthrough downstream and start outflanking the rest of the defenders on the river line. At some point they need to retreat, because they have lost the advantage of the terrain feature.\n\nSuch is the situation in Bakhmut. The value of it was largely lost by mid January, when the vulnerable flanks collapsed. After that, the UAF aren't defending from prepared positions, they're having to retreat from hasty position to hasty position, where they have less and less tactical advantage. Especially when their supply lines are lost with remaining heavily threatened.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the Russians bypassed a large amount of the urban terrain in Bakhmut. Their main efforts are on the flanks, moving primarily through rural areas with the occasional small town or village, while the pressure directly towards the densely populated portions of the city itself are largely fixing actions forcing the Ukrainians to commit large numbers of defenders to prevent a successful Russian frontal assault on the city. The city of Bakhmut was largely bypassed.\n\nMeanwhile, while the fieldworks defenses to the west of Bakhmut are more vulnerable than heavily constructed reinforced concrete structures commonly found in Ukraine, and especially possessing less concealment than can be found in urban areas like Bakhmut, those hilltop fieldworks are largely untouched. Trenches, bunkers and minefields that are still hidden, the Russians haven't identified them yet by ISR or probing attacks. Avenues of approach that still haven't been identified, strong and weak points that the Russians aren't aware of.\n\nTo successfully attack that line requires a total Russian operational reset. They're going to have take a pause, move their brigade and divisional rear areas, supplies, command posts about \\~20 km or so. They're going to have to launch ISR and start trying to figure out where everything is. They're going to have to organize probing attacks to light up the UAF defenses. They need to create an operational plan to crack the nut, like they realized the way to take Bakhmut was outflanking it. There will be an operational level weakness, but they wont find it for some time, and probably many tens of thousands of casualties from now. That buys the Ukrainians time to prepare for offensive ops, because they should only be defending in the first place to gain temporary respite to launch an offensive.\n\nLastly, and I cannot stress this enough, when fighting a fires centric enemy like the Russians, a literal one trick pony, it's best to not remain in one location to get hit by those fires, especially if the enemy knows where you are. If that decision is made, nd they cannot or wont conduct a mobile defense, then the proper response is to dig as deep as possible, to hide as best as possible. And that means essentially rewriting \"the book\" on entrenchments, on tunnels, on camouflage. But the UAF are not doing that, they are actually rather lackluster in the construction of their fixed defenses.

The value of it was largely lost by mid January, when the vulnerable flanks collapsed. After that, the UAF aren&#39;t defending from prepared positions, they&#39;re having to retreat from hasty position to hasty position, where they have less and less tactical advantage. Especially when their supply lines are lost with remaining heavily threatened.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to consider is that the Russians bypassed a large amount of the urban terrain in Bakhmut. Their main efforts are on the flanks, moving primarily through rural areas with the occasional small town or village, while the pressure directly towards the densely populated portions of the city itself are largely fixing actions forcing the Ukrainians to commit large numbers of defenders to prevent a successful Russian frontal assault on the city. The city of Bakhmut was largely bypassed.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, while the fieldworks defenses to the west of Bakhmut are more vulnerable than heavily constructed reinforced concrete structures commonly found in Ukraine, and especially possessing less concealment than can be found in urban areas like Bakhmut, those hilltop fieldworks are largely untouched. Trenches, bunkers and minefields that are still hidden, the Russians haven&#39;t identified them yet by ISR or probing attacks. Avenues of approach that still haven&#39;t been identified, strong and weak points that the Russians aren&#39;t aware of.</p>\n\n<p>To successfully attack that line requires a total Russian operational reset. They&#39;re going to have take a pause, move their brigade and divisional rear areas, supplies, command posts about ~20 km or so. They&#39;re going to have to launch ISR and start trying to figure out where everything is. They&#39;re going to have to organize probing attacks to light up the UAF defenses. They need to create an operational plan to crack the nut, like they realized the way to take Bakhmut was outflanking it. There will be an operational level weakness, but they wont find it for some time, and probably many tens of thousands of casualties from now. That buys the Ukrainians time to prepare for offensive ops, because they should only be defending in the first place to gain temporary respite to launch an offensive.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, when fighting a fires centric enemy like the Russians, a literal one trick pony, it&#39;s best to not remain in one location to get hit by those fires, especially if the enemy knows where you are. If that decision is made, nd they cannot or wont conduct a mobile defense, then the proper response is to dig as deep as possible, to hide as best as possible. And that means essentially rewriting &quot;the book&quot; on entrenchments, on tunnels, on camouflage. But the UAF are not doing that, they are actually rather lackluster in the construction of their fixed defenses. In the age of drone ISR, <a href=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3067ea99459f09491e675e65995f443b335a6a25/0_220_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a9e7b04a62c1cc44f347547c445391d6\">this is subpar</a>.</p>\n</div>",

They&#39;re deliberately fighting in cities to use the urban terrain to their advantage tactically. They aren&#39;t remotely taking steps to keep military and civilians separate. And they definitely aren&#39;t doing their best when there are still civilians in Bakhmut right now. </p>\n\n<p>But then again, &quot;their best&quot; can mean anything you want it to mean, they can do nothing and as long as you want to defend them that is their best. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They are the target of a brutal invasion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And now they are active combatants in a year long war against them to liberate their country.

They&#39;ve done the same thing after major storms and other major destruction. That&#39;s the whole GD point of martial law.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have wondered why these people chose to stay as well, but forced displacement will certainly raise questions. Let me put it like this: where is this concern by the NYT or BBC if they think it should be done? Find me any article by them saying that the UAF is failing its citizens by not forcibly removing citizens. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to prove your fake ass argument for you. You&#39;re the one suggesting the western press would have a fit. Its not my job to prove they wouldn&#39;t, its your job to prove they would.

Right now there are no politics in the classical sense; on practically every issue, the sides go \"let's go kick ass together and settle this after the war\" out of basic survival instinct.",

From what I can tell from every encounter I have had with Ukrainian people in the last year, a similar effect seems to have happened in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>So the reason it&#39;s so hard to tell is that we are really talking about a hypothetical &quot;if there was peace now, how would the politics end up looking like&quot; scenario. Right now there are no politics in the classical sense; on practically every issue, the sides go &quot;let&#39;s go kick ass together and settle this after the war&quot; out of basic survival instinct.</p>\n</div>",

Some political actors behind the scenes may be using that fact in an apparent attempt to foment tensions between the two. <strong>Rumours even persist that the presidential administration might be inclined to replace the popular but independent-minded General Zaluzhny with his former boss. Cracks of disunity have high-placed Western military officials worried.</strong> The two generals on their part say they fully trust each other and wish to stay out of politics.
