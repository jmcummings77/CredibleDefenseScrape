        "body": "There isn't much in the way of new unit information this week, but here's my book report on what I've seen.  The AFU has 13 mech brigades (and one Hunter Brigade) in training at this point. Some such as the 47th OMB have been in training for 5 months, been to Germany for combined arms training and come back and are (as far as I can tell) ready for deployment. Even the last to be disclosed, the 41st OMB, appears to have completed company level training and moved on to battalion/brigade level activity. \n\nIn non mechanized expansion, there have been a number of developments. 4 corps level HQ units have been stood up, and are being populated by 3-4 brigades each, making them more or less equitable to US division. The HQs appear to be exclusively C3 hubs, with no additional artillery/ engineering reserves, but they may have  medical, recon, intel resources. \n\nRumors of a new armor brigade have been clarified-No new unit as such, but the 5th armor has been brought up to full strength (it apparently had been donating parts to other units to keep them at full strength through the fall/winter).  \n\nOne additional new infantry Brigade has been announced, and it's a bit odd: The 142nd reserve rifle brigade. The announcement was not accompanied by any explanation of what a reserve rifle brigade is. If I were to take a guess (and spitballing is all I have here) I would say that 1) the UAF found itself with enough bits and pieces at the end of the spring build up to form a 'motorized brigade' style unit and 2) The name is a definitive statement that the well of IFVs/APCs and even MRAPs has run dry.  \n\nThat's a techy subject to me. I've voiced fears that several of the Mech brigades aren't all that mech, having been fleshed out with MRAPs and maybe even armored hummers. In the last week, I heard Perun voice a similar concern.  It all starts with a question of 'how many APCs has Ukraine scraped together? America provided 300, the British said they would provide two (but a portion of those turned out to be MRAPs , Norway/Sweden/Germany another hundred, but it gets fuzzy beyond that. France and Finland said they would be providing substantial numbers, but what does that mean? Italy made non specific commitments and Poland said they were outfitting a brigade, whatever that means.  But there's also been significant transfers to Ukraine directly through purchase (with US funds)- Not brand new, but lots of M113s, BMP1s and various british  surplus vehicles.  On the other hand, there's additional requirements for the new AAB brigade, the two new Marine brigades, and let's not forget the Interior ministry.  All we have is back of the envelope math, but that indicates that yes, MRAAPs are being counted as APC equivalents in many of the mech brigades.\n\nDoes this matter? Both are protected transport, but comparing a MaxPro to a Bradley is like comparing a baboon to a Guerilla (under this analogy, an armored hummer or other  IMV is a chimpanzee, and a regular truck is a spider monkey) but comparing an IFV  to a common APC like a stryker or VAB comes out much the same.  It all comes down to assault fire support.   \n\nIt does at least appear that the brigades will have armor battalions, though some appear to have been bunched together from what could be found (for example, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/surrounded-and-outgunned-ukraines-tank-crews-prepare-for-battle-of-bakhmut\n\nIt's a very strange article about the 214th Assault battalion last seen at Bakmut as an independent infantry battalion which got chewed up last fall, which then segways into moaning over how their  tanks are old T-64s, ignoring that light infantry battalions don't even have tanks, so the 214th was (as we've speculated) incorporated into one of the new Mech brigades)\n\nLeaving the friendly confines of the ground forces, the new brigades of the other stake holders continue their formation and training. I have little new to report regarding the marine brigades , but for the 82nd AAB, I can report that they are mounted on Strykers, and they just completed their combined arms training in Germany. \n\nThe Interior Ministry's Offensive Guard program has expanded again to 8 brigades and is reported to be 40,000 men strong, but as this involved incorporation of pretty much all the existing National Guard units, articles which trumpet the 'formation' as all new volunteers  ignore the 20,000-25,000 veterans cannibalized from the IM fast reaction brigades. \n\nThat's about all I've got, except for a final odd independent unit. The Consolidated Rifle Brigade has been formed, consisting of volunteers from the various Ukrainian Air Force guard battalions (NOT part of the Air Assault Forces)  No more odd than the Border Patrol and Security Police brigades formed within the Offensive Guard I suppose,  I look forward to learning more.\n\nEdit: I glossed over the 13th Jaeger Brigade above, but there was a nice clip of them working with Swedish instructors, learning woodcraft and forest combat skills.",

You could use Ukrainian data to predict how many losses Oryx is going to report in about a week. There was no such correlation the other way. Obviously it cannot be very high, even if on average it takes ~7 days for Oryx to get the loss data, the whole time series will be smooshed regardless of its quality.\n\nUkrainian data also peaked exactly at the right times we'd expect it to, and with the kinds of equipment we can expect it to have happened. The peaks corresponded to days when events happened, even if they only became public a few days later. Notable events to correlate are Saki airfield attack, Bilohorivka crossings, two major counteroffensives, data for all of them was pretty good.\n\nAll such checks very strongly suggest that the data is real and based on real field reports from the troops. Now it could very well be highly inflated (either unintentionally due to troops inflating their estimates and double counting enemy losses and not enough correction for that; or intentionally for propaganda reasons), but there's no way it's just made up like some other countries like doing.\n\nAlso air losses data have very little independent confirmation.",

Taiwan&#39;s current existence is only a threat to Chinese internal politics and sense of what history says China is owed. Describing Chinese ambitions re Taiwan as a choice between appeasement, and not, is framing Taiwan as an aggressor; framing Taiwan as the threat to peace, stability, self governance.</p>\n\n<p>And that, to come full circle, is a bit gross.</p>\n\n<p>If the CCP wants to try to mischaracterise things in that way, so be it, but nobody else should be normalising that language for them.</p>\n</div>",

The teams boarded more than 30 vessels bristling with weapons, formidable gifts from friends in the West.  \n> \n> Their orders: to launch an assault to recapture the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the Russians on the opposite bank.\n> Kyiv has never acknowledged attacking Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power station but Ukrainian special forces, military intelligence and navy personnel involved have revealed to The Times details of the highly dangerous operation to recover the site.  \n> \n> By the night of the raid, Russian troops had held the power station for over six months, using its territory to bombard Ukrainian cities across the water and a major steel plant in Nikopol. Ukraine\u2019s desperate attempt to retake the facility from President Putin\u2019s troops, and the reasons it gave for doing so, highlight the risk to Europe of nuclear disaster at the contested plant.\n> Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), visited the site last week in an effort to broker a deal to demilitarise the area around its six nuclear reactors.  \n> \n> \u201cIt is very, very important that we agree on the fundamental principle that a nuclear power plant should not be attacked under any circumstances,\u201d Grossi said during his visit, which took place a week after The Times asked the IAEA to comment on the raid. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be used to attack others, likewise. A nuclear accident with radiological consequences will spare no one.\u201d  \n> \n> On October 19 the Ukrainian soldiers were excited. If they survived the war, their mission would be one to tell their grandchildren about, an officer involved said.\n> \u201cThe idea was that this would be an infantry-only battle. They wouldn\u2019t be able to use artillery against us, as this is a nuclear plant,\u201d the officer said. Drawn from select units of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, GUR, and including the Shaman battalion, the Kraken Regiment and the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, even the youngest among his brothers-in-arms were already battle-hardened. Yet none of them expected the resistance they would face at the power plant.  \n> \n> \u201cThe Russians built a very dense defence, they mined everything,\u201d the officer said. \u201cWhen we were approaching they even pulled up tanks and artillery and started firing at us right on the water.\u201d\n> Despite the site\u2019s strategic importance, the Russian occupation was ill disciplined, chaotic and dangerous, according to Petro Kotin, president of Ukraine\u2019s state nuclear enterprise Energoatom.  \n> \n> \u201cThere are Russian national guards, FSB [the security service], Omon [special police], DNR [Donetsk People\u2019s Republic], LNR [Luhansk People\u2019s Republic], the Kadyrov guys [serving Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the Chechen Republic] and they communicate with each other only a limited amount,\u201d Kotin added.  \n> \n> \u201cThey do whatever they want whenever it comes into their minds. For example, one group starts to repair the line that connects ZNPP [the plant] to the Ukrainian electricity grid, then another group will shell it.\u201d  \n> \n> Although the reactors have been shut down since September 11, the plant needs electricity to pump coolant around nuclear fuel if it is to avoid disaster, Kotin said.\n> \u201cThe plant has been in full blackout mode six times already, working only on backup diesel generators, now down to two weeks\u2019 fuel supply,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they stop you will have melting in six reactors and six spent fuel pools. Some reactors will melt in three hours, some will take a day.\u201d  \n> \n> Before the raid Russian troops had tortured staff responsible for the safe operation of the reactors, plant workers said, increasing the risk of the type of human error that caused catastrophe at Chernobyl. Two days before the assault, on October 17, Energoatom reported that Oleh Kostyukov and Oleh Oshek, two senior employees essential to the reactor\u2019s safe operation, had been abducted by Russian troops, raising the hazard level still further.  \n> \n> By October each of the seven pillars of nuclear safety had been violated at the plant, according to the IAEA, which said the presence of Russian troops on its territory was inviting disaster. President Zelensky\u2019s administration had appealed to the United Nations to help evict Putin\u2019s forces, but weeks of diplomacy had failed to resolve the risk. Ukraine decided to take matters into its own hands.  \n> \n> As special forces speedboats crossed a stretch of river nearly three miles wide, precision Himars rockets provided by the US smashed into Russian positions on the riverbank.  \n> \n> \u201cThis is our artillery and Himars working. Here they are shelling us in the water, on the Dnipro River,\u201d the officer narrated as he showed video of the assault to The Times, explaining how his patrol boat had probed Russian defences on the bank for weaknesses.  \n> \n> Asked whether the US had provided targets for the Himars before the raid, a US defence source confirmed that \u201ctime-sensitive\u201d intelligence was provided to Ukrainian special forces, although they declined to give specific details. \u201cWe do share information with them but they are responsible for the selection, prioritisation and ultimate decisions to engage threats,\u201d the source said.\n> Once the Ukrainian boats had neared the shoreline, the Russian guns opened up, forcing the soldiers to change direction.  \n> \n> \u201cWe had speedboats, a lot of boats,\u201d said the officer. \u201cWe repeatedly assaulted their positions, from our shore to their shore. They kept on shelling us, really heavy shelling.\u201d \n> \n> A handful of the Ukrainian special forces teams in smaller boats managed to make it to the shore as dawn broke, engaging the Russians in a three-hour firefight on the outskirts of the town of Enerhodar, which adjoins the plant. The main force was unable to land, however.  \n> \n> \u201cIt was impossible for such a large group to penetrate,\u201d the special forces officer said. \u201cWith smaller groups, yes, we were advancing, penetrating and fighting them. But with a large group it was impossible, as they were lurking everywhere.\u201d  \n>   \n> \n> His team tried to engage the tanks on the shoreline but it was difficult to fire anti-tank weapons while moving at speed over the water. The larger boats manoeuvred to try to attack Enerhodar from the opposite flank but a constant hail of fire eventually forced all the Ukrainians to withdraw.  \n> \n> \u201cA lot of lives were saved thanks to the commander of this operation. When he realised it would be very, very difficult and we would take heavy casualties, instead of stupidly saying, \u2018Go forward!\u2019 he decided we could retreat.\u201d  \n> \n> Even among senior Ukrainian officials who are adamant the Russians must be driven out, the attempt to take the plant by force is considered controversial.\n> Energoatom\u2019s Kotin said: \u201cIf our army can advance south towards Crimea, toward Melitopol, this is the only option \u2014 no direct shelling of the plant, no direct advance on the territory of the plant with direct actions against the Russians. It is very dangerous to do such things near nuclear material. Any damage will bring radiation to the people and to the whole world.\u201d  \n> \n> However, the greatest threat to the plant remains the Russian presence there, Kotin stressed. Today the Russians are using control centres as barracks, installing gun emplacements on the roofs of plant buildings and constructing fortifications close to storage sites of radioactive material. They keep ammunition trucks inside the reactors\u2019 turbine halls, risking a nuclear incident that could blight Ukraine for decades, he added.  \n> \n> \u201cWe see the progressive degradation of the plant in all directions \u2014 the site itself, equipment and personnel; all type of programmes which in normal, peaceful times would be considered unacceptable,\u201d Kotin added.  \n> \n> \u201cWe are in a state of emergency, waiting until something bad happens, and that could happen at any time.\u201d",

Any damage will bring radiation to the people and to the whole world.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>However, the greatest threat to the plant remains the Russian presence there, Kotin stressed. Today the Russians are using control centres as barracks, installing gun emplacements on the roofs of plant buildings and constructing fortifications close to storage sites of radioactive material. They keep ammunition trucks inside the reactors\u2019 turbine halls, risking a nuclear incident that could blight Ukraine for decades, he added.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe see the progressive degradation of the plant in all directions \u2014 the site itself, equipment and personnel; all type of programmes which in normal, peaceful times would be considered unacceptable,\u201d Kotin added.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are in a state of emergency, waiting until something bad happens, and that could happen at any time.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

They greatly overestimate how much will actually be lofted, and underestimate rain out, which to be fair we only have practical, measurable examples of recently.\n\nThe modesl of how cities burn is flawed as well, deliberately, based more on how WW2 German and Japanese cities burned than modern ones, which have vastly lower fire loading. They also assume a 100% burnup of the cities, therefore releasing all of the possible black carbon available, and every city will turn into a super firestorm version of Hamburg and Hiroshima, which didn't even happen that often in WW2 despite the best efforts of the RAF.\n\nAnother point is that every single scenario they come up with always has the war happening at the worst possible moment, late winter, in order to greatly increase the shock effect of the temperature drop, and the absolute numbers for scaremongering.

They also assume a 100% burnup of the cities, therefore releasing all of the possible black carbon available, and every city will turn into a super firestorm version of Hamburg and Hiroshima, which didn&#39;t even happen that often in WW2 despite the best efforts of the RAF.</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that every single scenario they come up with always has the war happening at the worst possible moment, late winter, in order to greatly increase the shock effect of the temperature drop, and the absolute numbers for scaremongering.
