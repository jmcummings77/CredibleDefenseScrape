Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The view of America as a great power/hegemon tends to be very cynical these days, which is understandable after the Iraq War in particular, but it shouldn't obscure the fact that American power has always been underpinned, at least nominally, with the idea of espousing the ideals of liberal democracy.   \n\n\nFor example. in WWI, Wilson was a rabid idealist. One of the major reasons he wanted to enter the war and get a say in the post WWI order was because he had grand visions for a liberal democratic world. Indeed, his efforts at Versailles were nigh fanatical in this regard, especially when it came to ensuring self-determination, curtailing the \"tyrannical\" authority of the old empires, and generally promoting the ideals of liberal democracy and economics. And he was wildly popular in Europe at the time for doing so. Similarly, in WWII, Roosevelt wanted the end of empires in no small part because he believed they were fundamentally flawed/wrong as institutions. They had caused two world wars and needed to be shut down for the betterment of humanity. That's why they pounced on the opportunity to twist Britain's arm with the Atlantic Charter, which espoused a post-war world ordered on liberal democratic values.  \n\n\nNow it's perfectly valid to argue that during the scope of the Cold War the vision was warped (I would 100% agree with it, citing Vietnam as a key example of where it really went off the rails), but a lot of the folks in the US machine didn't think so. The fight against communism was ideologically driven as much as it was a great power struggle. And that ideology was always liberal democracy. Even the US' modern interventionism in Iraq and Afghanistan was at heart an ideologically driven affair, even if it was tainted and twisted. Obviously, all of this can be abstracted to great power competition or just basic IR neorealism (That is the point of neorealism, after all). You could also argue that the values of liberal democracy are not the best for the world as a whole. But I think it is narrow-minded to simply say that it was all self-motivated expansion of power when in reality those individuals who were at the forefront of US power moves, such as Wilson and Roosevelt, believed so strongly in an ideological component of doing things not just for the betterment of America but for the betterment of the world as a whole.",

By the time they complete the training, expected to last about 10 weeks, the Abrams tanks currently being built for the Ukrainian forces will be ready, he said.\n\nA U.S. official said the 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks needed for the training arrived at the port in Bremerhaven, Germany, last weekend and they will get to the base by early this coming week. Their arrival at Grafenwoehr is a couple of weeks ahead of the schedule that was mapped out when military leaders from around Europe and elsewhere met in Germany last month to discuss Ukraine\u2019s needs for the war against Russia.\n\nThe tanks the U.S. is providing Ukraine are being built to its military\u2019s specifications and will get to Ukraine by early fall, just as the troops are finished with their instruction. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details of the delivery not publicly released.\n\nThe tank training will be the latest and most lethal new layer of combat instruction the U.S. is providing Ukraine\u2019s troops to give them the best chance to overwhelm and punch through Russia\u2019s battle lines. Over the past few months U.S. troops have trained more than 8,800 Ukrainians, including on how to use Stryker and Bradley fighting vehicles and M109 Paladins together on the battlefield. The Bradleys and Strykers are armored and armed vehicles used to ferry troops, and the Paladin is a self-propelled howitzer gun.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, pressed Austin to move quickly to get the tanks into Ukrainian troops\u2019 hands and onto the battlefield.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything possible to accelerate the delivery of these tanks, and early fall is a projection,\u201d Austin said.\n\nCollins and others noted the urgency of the fight in Ukraine, and she told Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to be blunt about Ukraine\u2019s needs. Defense leaders should not let budget concerns dissuade them from seeking more weapons if that\u2019s what Kyiv needs to be successful in a counteroffensive, said Collins, the ranking Republican on the panel.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that the administration provide Ukraine with what it needs in time to defend and take back its sovereign territory,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect the administration not to wait until the 11th hour if the Ukrainians seek more before the end of the fiscal year.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., noting the broader implications of the war, questioned Milley on the impact a Russian victory could have on China and its deliberations on whether to move to take the self-governing island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims.\n\n\u201cI think that the Chinese are watching the war between Russia and Ukraine very carefully,\u201d Milley said, adding that if Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds, \u201cChina will learn certain lessons.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may not be the single decisive point, but I think it will calculate into their decision-making process as to whether or not they attack to seize the island of Taiwan. So I think the outcome of Ukraine is critical to much broader issues than just Ukraine,\u201d Milley said.",
