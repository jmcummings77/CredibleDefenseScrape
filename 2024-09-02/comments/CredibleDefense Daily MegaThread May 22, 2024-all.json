Going into Rafah was the result of Hamas not agreeing to any acceptable deal (for months!), not the fact that they agreed to the Egyptian deal at the last minute. The response to this was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because what Hamas agreed to was not the same as what Israel had agreed to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is true (as I said in my response), but it doesn\u2019t demonstrate that the Egyptian proposal lead to the Rafah invasion. Hence \u201cYou think Hamas would have agreed to what Israel wanted if it wasn&#39;t for the last minute Egyptian changes\u201d followed by \u201cthe reason for the invasion of Rafah invasion was the failure to reach a ceasefire agreement.\u201d IE, I don\u2019t see evidence that the Egyptian deal changed anything important, and that there would have been a ceasefire if it hadn\u2019t happened.</p>\n\n<p>To put it more plainly - if we take it as a given that Hamas wasn\u2019t going to agree to an acceptable deal either way - particularly since they hadn\u2019t agreed to one for months - it\u2019s hard to see how what Egypt did (as the original poster claims) \u201ctotally sunk negotiation chances\u201d or \u201cled to Israel rapidly moving into Rafah.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

If they don't they'll practically send the signal that NATO can participate with minimal risk and that's game over for Russia. They'd be sent packing back to 1991 borders *very* quickly.\n\nIt seems to me that the Americans have found a strategy of slow rolling the Russian red lines. All weapon packages have been introduced one by another from simply moving the goal posts slightly over and over. Without significant Russian response.\n\nEdit: ~~massively~~ in terms of political consequences and not necessarily raining missiles. Even a minor conventional strike on NATO territory would be unprecedented.",

However, the main move is strategic deterrence.  Saying \"Russia you can't shoot over our territory any longer\" is not an escalation as Russia already escalated by doing so, it is a denial of Russia's escalation.  It would be up to Russia to escalate further, but a tit-for-tat shooting down of missiles to help Ukraine doesn't change things from that standpoint.\n\nThe escalation from the France-led Coalition will be when they use this \"shoot down of missiles in our territory\" and they expand it to their troops in Ukraine (when that comes likely first as trainers and later maintainers).
