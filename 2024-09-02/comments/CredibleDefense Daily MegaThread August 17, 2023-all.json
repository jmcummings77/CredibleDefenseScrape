Resistance groups lack support from any foreign government.\n\n2. They lack supply lines to neighboring countries and between provinces which leaves guerrillas chronically short on weapons, ammunition, and money. This has also led to guerrillas being captured and killed while trying to help other units or enter/leave the country.\n\n3. Disinterest in international media heavily limits the spread of news of their actions and messages.\n\n4. Perceived US support of the Taliban by Afghans has discouraged wider resistance against the Taliban as many see it as futile.\n\n5. The participation of members of the former Afghan government in these groups has somewhat decreased their legitimacy and caused infighting which has prevented them from forming a unified front or coordination above a local level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall this article accurately describes the struggles of anti-Taliban groups although I disagree with the 1st and 4th points as Tajikistan continues to provide at least limited support to the NRF and the effect of perceived US support of the Taliban is negligible IMO. However recent events are encouraging as the AFF and especially the NRF have significantly increased their presence and activity in Badakhshan Province which is the most promising target if either group wants to challenge the Taliban's territorial control and establish a connection with neighboring countries, in particular, recent events have shown that NRF forces are strong in Badakhshan and may even have de-facto control over some rural areas (I'm going to write a separate post about recent guerrilla activities hopefully tomorrow). Additionally, both the NRF and AFF have announced their willingness to cooperate further, and as both groups have recently significantly scaled up their activities their successes have been impossible for the Taliban to hide as can be seen on social media where some Taliban fighters and pro-Taliban accounts have started to claim that the US or France are actively supporting the guerrillas. Overall after a disappointing start to the year, anti-Taliban forces look to be the strongest they have ever been and in my opinion will have the capability to challenge Taliban control at least temporarily at the district level in the coming year.",

It was also during a period when simulator training was substantially less useful. We also do not know how much preparation has been happening behind the scenes, although I've heard that Ukrainian pilots have at least started on simulator training. So it's possible the program is farther along than we can tell from information in the open source, meaning any estimates we see should be treated as upper boundaries rather than lower (i.e., the F-16s will be delivered \"no later than\", rather \"sometime around\" or \"sometime after\" announced estimates, more on which below). \n\nFurther, the Ukrainians are not developing novel doctrine for a brand new class of fighter for their air force nor are they working out the kinks with a newly produced aircraft, but instead are benefiting from decades of US and allied experienced flying multiroles in general and the F-16 in particular on top of the Ukrainian Air Force's own experience operating comparable (albeit far lower quality) multirole aircraft. Bottom line, it's not all bad news, and 22 months should very much represent a far upper boundary estimate, I think, particularly because the announced training schedules are much more aggressive than that.\n\nThe real problem for Ukraine is simply scheduling. They are beholden to the training cycles and resources of their allies, especially the US. [For example, per WaPo, training for the first cohort of pilots is supposed to take six months, but won't start until January because the US is requiring English-language proficiency classes for many of the pilots](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/11/f-16-fighters-ukraine-training-delays/). In any case, even what WaPo describes as a pessimistic timeline puts the first trained pilots in the air over Ukraine sometime in July of next year. \n\nYour argument also depends on a specific time frame for the war ending, which is an inherently difficult to predict event. You didn't state explicitly when you think the war will end or precisely how long you think F-16 adoption will take, but from context you seem to be thinking sometime later than (but probably approximately on a roughly similar scale as) 22 months from now, if I am right to presume you think it will take Ukraine longer but not orders of magnitude longer to adopt F-16s than the US took. Based on the rates at which Russia is burning through its materiel reserves and the lethargy with which they have mobilized their defense industrial base, mid-2025 is a reasonable upper bound estimate for when they will essentially run completely out of critical supplies and basic military systems like IFVs, artillery, and tanks, and so in all probability they will be forced to negotiate or withdraw sometime around or shortly before those supplies run out completely. Which is a similar time frame to what you suggest for F-16 deployment, again if I am reading you correctly. So what you are suggesting isn't out of the realm of possibility, nor is it even wildly unlikely. It's just an upper bound estimate for F-16s combined with a relatively lower bound estimate for the war ending.\n\nYet there are enormous, gargantuan error bars around both estimates. Under optimistic scenarios for Ukraine, F-16 adoption could happen just barely before the end of war, even if it takes only six months from now to get them deployed. Under more pessimistic conditions, it could happen just after the war ends in two or three years. However, based on the announced training timelines, I think it's far more likely that the F-16s will be deployed within about a year than delays in training or doctrinal adaptation will push it out past 18 months (which would represent the training schedule slipping, but only a single cycle). I am much less optimistic that the war will end within that time frame, simply because neither side is close to achieving their strategic objectives nor expending all of their available military resources. Without a dramatic shift in battlefield results over the next two months before the mud season, both belligerents will likely remain both willing and able to fight for at least the next year.",

Under optimistic scenarios for Ukraine, F-16 adoption could happen just barely before the end of war, even if it takes only six months from now to get them deployed. Under more pessimistic conditions, it could happen just after the war ends in two or three years. However, based on the announced training timelines, I think it&#39;s far more likely that the F-16s will be deployed within about a year than delays in training or doctrinal adaptation will push it out past 18 months (which would represent the training schedule slipping, but only a single cycle). I am much less optimistic that the war will end within that time frame, simply because neither side is close to achieving their strategic objectives nor expending all of their available military resources. Without a dramatic shift in battlefield results over the next two months before the mud season, both belligerents will likely remain both willing and able to fight for at least the next year.</p>\n</div>",

Generals in the Indian military discuss whether conflict with China is inevitable as India continues to rise.](https://youtu.be/qdYHWvT0gic)\n\nTalk is part of a much broader, multi-part discussion over whether or not an emerging U.S./India - Russia/China power dyad is emerging. Their broad view to that question is that even though reality is much more complex by 2030 India will essentially have to answer that question. Today, right now it is mostly strategic posturing. I can post that discussion if people would like too. \n\nTheir key takeaways: \n\n3 Global powers exist in the international system (US, China, Russia).

                        "body": "I understand where you're coming from, and it may at the very least be fair to say that the popularity of the Iranian regime has been waning -- I'm not sure if that's the case because I don't follow it very closely but it's also plausible, and correlated with protests. I don't want to discount this point, only to point out that there is some context to it that I think is relevant.\n\nThe current Iranian regime and, say, the communist regime in the Democratic German Republic, both fall under the authoritarian umbrella. The latter pursued a great deal of poor economic policies, and retained control through a variety of brutal means, but was also founded on an ideology that gradually lost the support of even the relatively few adherents it had early on. So it was, indeed, quasi-universally hated by the time it fell. \n\nThe Iranian regime is, however, based on an ideology that does have significant numbers of adherents among the wider population, or perhaps more precisely, is based on an ideology that agrees with the main religious and ideological tenets of many Iranians (see e.g. [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230818053223/https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-754902)). Due to its name (Islamic republic) and some of its policies Western media tends to portray the Iranian political establishment as some sort of ultra-conservative Taliban-like beardheads, which is not *exactly* true; in fact, among the more traditionalist segments of the population, it's actually the ultra-conservatives that are the least supportive of the government (to the point where they even had polarizing figures among them, like al-Yamani a few years ago). \n\nA large segment of the Iranian population does in fact agree with the government on most \"doctrinal\" points; they may have their own issues with e.g. corruption, or disagree with how they are enforced, but they are not entirely unlikely to view these as things that should be settled between the government and the governed (see e.g. [this study](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Iranian_PO_After_Protests_FINAL_070918.pdf)). So, to cite a recent example, while obviously condemning the death of Mahsa Amini, a surprising (by Western standards) proportion of the Iranian population actually agrees that the government should strictly enforce Islamic law (as understood in Iran, long story), including the women's dress code. You and me may think that's backwards but we're not Supreme Leaders (unless you are in which case I take all this back and please don't kill me :-) ). They have an issue with the unrestrained rape, torture and murder that security forces use as para-judiciary tools but not with what they see as the main goals of the regime.\n\nThe comparison with the current Russian regime is definitely justified, but I think we should be mindful of the same limits. Putin's regime is barely half as old as the Islamic Republic, and has barely managed to assemble a vague ideology in the last ten years or so, most of it based on historic revisionism and thus limited in terms of moral and spiritual authority. The Iranian regime is based on an ideology that's also novel, but much more coherent, and based on the dominant religion in that part of the world, and it's not like it has replaced a democratic regime that was very mindful of people's needs, either.\n\nI don't want to portray the Iranian republic as some democratic heaven that's misunderstood by the West, IMHO it absolutely is a repressive regime which has co-opted a religious substrate to justify its criminal means, rather than guide its way to higher goals, and I have zero sympathy for that. But it's also a regime that shares a lot of moral and religious affinities with those that it governs, and that absolutely colours their opinions on how they'd like to see it changed.",

Russian logistics further back go through one of the most developed and extensive infrastructure network in the whole of Ukraine with that general area being essentially a gateway from Rostov-on-Don and Taganrog which are both biggest logistical hubs for everything Ukraine related except Northern Luhansk as well as having the advantage of being positioned in Russia proper which means no way to interdict the logistics with Western equipment until it reaches Ukrainian territory, etc.\n\nFurther down the river or going from Vuhledar, the situation improves slightly and a few more (poor) roads open up in a separate area, but it's still far outmatched by everything that Russia can use by the time they reach it. Volnovalkha itself (which is along with Zachativka, latter being positioned some 40 kilometres from the current front but objectively only reachable through the single aforementioned road down a valley, probably the only two strategic objectives they can even consider even barely realistic at this point) is positioned [on heights that are just about unmatched by anything anywhere close to it](https://imgur.com/a/bUM9RqU) as well as having the added benefit of being extremely well fortified, essentially since the beginning of the war - it was key to Russian siege of Mariupol and the whole advance from Donbas into the wider area. The whole area is in relative proximity to areas that Russia is still pushing in (Marinka, Avdiivka, etc.) which they can most likely partially give up in order to transfer over materiel and men should the need arise, and offers an ability to quickly move any reserves they have from other areas - even if they chose to move them from Northern Luhansk through Russia or Donbas itself. There are also significant untapped reserves further down towards the Azov sea. The whole area ([Azov Upland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Upland) and [Donetsk Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donets_Ridge)) which can be considered even remotely strategically meaningful is really hilly, barely any area with active hostilities are comparable to it.\n\nSituation in the other area is much different, if you reach the vicinity of Tokmak (currently 22-ish kilometres away) you can achieve fire control over every single link (Edit 1: I meant to say every single significant link\\*) from Kherson to Donbas except for the Berdyansk - Melitopol highway which would in that case supply everything all the way to the westernmost point of Kherson oblast IF Ukraine is able to take down couple of bridges from Crimea and/or the Kerch bridge, with the added benefit of the most of the area being reachable by GMLRS. It's simply by far the more significant strategic objective, and I'd argue along with Melitopol the single two most strategically significant towns in the current state of the war.\n\nEdit 2: In theory, if they were to secure Tokmak they could even use GMLRS on the Berdyansk - Melitopol highway, which is 60-ish kilometres from the centre of Tokmak. It's kinda in range, but probably in practical terms it would be at the tail end of what Ukraine would consider feasible/acceptable, but we've just yesterday seen them use HIMARS on a small shooting range some 50 kilometres from the frontlines, so if that was considered as a good enough target with regards to the cost/benefit analysis, I'd imagine this might just barely be considered as acceptable, too.",

I mean it's not like there are any north south orientated defensive lines in that sector to defend against an operational turning movement. But just to be on the safe side, the UAF would definitely not want to trigger the 35th to uproot itself from fixed defenses to come out in the open, its better to fight the Russians while they're dug in with less forces and ammo. Disperse, the new principle of warfare! \n\nMore so, the UAF should still focus their main main effort of the offensive on the most highly defended sector in Ukraine with the most defensives built in, that has barely budged in two months. After all, there is no threat from the Russians there, the Russians will never expect the Ukrainians to keep attacking the most defended place in Ukraine.

Though I do think if you had the right expectations for what Ukraine could do with an offensive they are actually doing well.  They haven't committed all their reserves, they have stopped major advancements by force concentration in the north, straightened the line around Bahkmut, made gains in the south, and even bridgeheads on the other side of Dnipro.  The only things that I can recall off my head are they have slowly gotten pushed back around Kriminna and the major blunder with Leos in the minefield.
