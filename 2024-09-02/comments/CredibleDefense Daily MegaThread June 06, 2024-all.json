The primary reasons France would not want to supply this missile comes largely down to wanting to keep its performance secret and prevent it from falling into Russian hands in the event of a missed shot. Those are certainly valid concerns from the perspective of the French government. But at the moment the choice is very much provide little to no support to Ukraine and wait until they are defeated then attempt to deter an emboldened Russia, or provide all possible aid to Ukraine and then need to deter a largely crippled Russia while having an ally in Ukraine.

This would deprive Ukraine of almost all its power generation.</p>\n\n<p>The best reason I can think of why Russia would not do this is because they fear and assume that Ukraine would retaliate with drone attacks against their own nuclear plants, several of which are within drone range. Hopefully that risk will keep Putin from taking this step, but I still am concerned about this possibility.</p>\n</div>",

But after losing 1 system at Pokrovsk, it's highly unlikely they will continue this strategy, the systems are just too valuable. \n\nSince you can't intercept a glide bomb, the key question really is: how do you stop Russian bombers from getting into drop range? This is a really tough problem to solve and I fear the answer is, that there isn't a reliable way. \n\nThe advertised Patriot maximum range is already pretty close to the drop range for conventional glide bombs. The new Russian glide bombs are aerodynamically improved, they've attached wings and more, so the gap might be even closer. So you have to put Patriots very close to the frontline, which isn't really feasible, as you've said.\n\nIn my opinion you have to try and destroy the aircraft on the airfields. ATACMS, long range drones, sabotage, every option should be considered and they did have limited success with these methods. Too many losses aircraft losses will force relocation of aircraft to further away or less convinient/equipped airports. This will reduce bombing runs, increase operational risk, etc.\n\nI'm really interested in other possible solutions to this issue, but I don't see many options.",

This implies that China may face outcomes even worse than those suffered by Japan in the 90s.\n\nKrugman is a Nobel prize winning economist and winner of the John Bates Clark medal (which is harder to get than a Nobel prize). His specialty is disaster economics. He's very much the real deal, a respected heavyweight in the field.\n\nRegarding the reticence to boost consumer spending - never-mind questioning how this reflects on the CCP's commitment to socialism and bettering the lives of the Chinese people. What I'm curious about is whether this is part of a pattern of bad leadership on the part of the CCP and Xi himself.\n\nNot everyone likes Zeihan, and I am never sure whether the things he says are crazy or whether I just don't know enough to understand them myself, but one thing Zeihan tends to harp on is that China is now incapable of leading itself. Xi has surrounded himself with people that are incapable of challenging him. Xi is isolated and prone to group-think. Xi does not receive information from within his own country that he might find to be disagreeable.\n\nZeihan has stated that the suppression of COVID statistics happened because no one wanted to bring the news to Xi. He's stated that Xi didn't know that the balloon that entered the US was actually a Chinese spy balloon for months after the incident because no one wanted to tell him.\n\nGoing back through things that are more obvious and a little less sensational, I can recall several obvious blunders China has made in the recent past.\n\n* Xi's China squabbled over that reef with the Philippines - resulting in 11 new military bases for the US. It should have been easy to guess that souring relations with the Philippines would drive them back into the arms of the United States, and result in the re-establishment of a US military presence there, yet they squabbled anyway. They still don't have that reef, and they've gravely undercut their ability to take Taiwan by fighting over it.\n* China openly bragged about civil-military fusion with regard to AI. It was everywhere for a little while, every Chinese Nationalist you'd run into would talk about how China is going to dominate in the AI space and use their new AI tech to upend the global order. The US then imposed chip sanctions on China.\n* China's \"Wolf Warrior\" diplomacy has been making it enemies, and its brash bullying nature just seems detrimental to the regime's goals. To me, this looks like a symptom of piss poor leadership.\n\nSo... here's my questions:\n\n1. Is this perceived leadership vacuum real?\n2. Is Krugman's point about Xi being unwilling to fix his own economy accurate, and how might this impact China's military capabilities with regard to a Taiwan conflict?\n3. Is this a part of a pattern of poor leadership on China's part, and how might such failings affect a conflict over Taiwan? Is there likely to be spillover into the military? Into military preparedness? Into tactics and strategy employed in an engagement over the strait?",

PRC is perhaps stagnating - sorta like Japan did for 3 decades - or growing slower than their own target number 5% annual growth rate posted by PRC/CCP but it's not collapsing.\n\nEDIT:  And b/c PRC is a dictatorship unlike Japan, the stagnation could trigger much bigger trouble for PRC than it did for Japan.  But no one can say that for sure one way or the other and Zeihan would be the last one I would listen to if nothing else b/c he's been making wrong predictions about PRC for at least 15+ years.\n\n>Can we claim he was wrong while ignoring the current collapse?\n\nLike I said, there is no collapse, not yet anyway.  I can say Zeihan is/was wrong b/c he claimed in 2010 that PRC would \"collapse in this coming decade\" as in 2010's.

Krugman\u2019s claim that devaluation was necessary for Latvia\u2019s recovery (and presumably also Estonia and Lithuania\u2019s) turned out to be wrong.\n\n>Krugman\u2019s disregard for the risk of sovereign default is perplexing. His main line of thinking seems to be that Europe has a growth problem, not a debt problem, and he appears to believe that a fiscal stimulus can always overcome the threat of the increased public debt burden. Even in the case of Greece, which had a gross public debt of 165 percent of GDP at the end of 2011, he failed to notice the danger but financial markets declared that the country\u2019s public debt was excessive. Slovenia\u2019s public debt of 50 percent of GDP, for instance, is more than the markets accept, as its bond yields have exceeded 7 percent.\n\n>Greece stands out as the main villain of the European crisis. Multiple Greek governments had grossly falsified their statistics and maintained an average budget deficit of 7 percent of GDP for the last two decades, refusing to fulfill their EU obligations. The George Papandreou government adopted a stabilization program in May 2010, with more IMF funding than any IMF program in history but one year later it had expanded the already excessive public administration by a net of 5,000 civil servants. Papandreou raised already high taxes rather than cutting public expenditures.\n\n>Yet incredibly, Krugman calls Greece a victim, laying all blame for its predicament on the EU, the European Monetary Union, and Germany.

If one takes the growth capability of Chinese advanced industry for granted, then it makes much more sense to deprive the Chinese MIC from access to top US tech like NVIDIA *now* for programs like the hypersonic glide vehicle, rather than let the Chinese MIC benefit from US tech while gradually building up domestic industry, which has been an **explicitly** stated goal of the CCP since the mid 2010s.\n\nWill the deprivation accelerate domestic Chinese technological development? Of course. China isn't some banana republic.

The idea that the US would just go along with the status quo while China catches up and erodes the lead strikes me as wishful thinking.

            "body": "Honestly, I've been wondering about the same thing for quite some time now - what are those videos *really* showing - but am starting to admittedly approach it from an entirely different angle.\n\nReddit search is kinda iffy currently, but I remember those videos started appearing sometime around ~2 years ago on URR (so basically almost at the beginning) and don't believe the rate of appearance of those videos has fallen much in the meantime.\n\nNow, we have our 'Western Media' that's gladly going around interviewing anyone willing to complain from the Ukrainian side (can't remember how many time I've read that 'It's worse than hell' on the frontlines anymore), yet we have, as you've observed, basically radio silence on this issue.\n\nThere's also an ongoing manpower crisis on the Ukrainian side, and important to mention, *not the first one according to our own media*: \n\n- [Time Is Not on Kyiv\u2019s Side: Training, Weapons, and Attrition in Ukraine, June 2022](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/time-is-not-on-kyivs-side-training-weapons-and-attrition-in-ukraine/): Each anecdote by itself a data point, but together they tell a story that belies the relentless optimism that has pervaded Ukrainian representation of the war from the outset. After four months of grinding attrition, the Ukrainian army is facing a manpower shortage.\n\n- [As Ukraine Loses Troops, How Long Can It Keep up the Fight?, June 2022](https://www.voanews.com/a/as-ukraine-loses-troops-how-long-can-it-keep-up-the-fight-/6603860.html): \"The problem is recruiting, training and getting them on the front line,\" said retired U.S. Marine Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n- [WP: Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow, March 2023](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2023/03/19/wp-ukraine-short-of-skilled-troops-and-munitions-as-losses-pessimism-grow/): Such grim assessments have spread a palpable, if mostly unspoken, pessimism from the front lines to the corridors of power in Kyiv, the capital.\n\n- [Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow, March 2023](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/): Same as above, actual source\n\n- [Ukraine\u2019s army is running out of men to recruit, and time to win, Victory may be in sight for Vladimir Putin, August 2023](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/08/22/ukraines-army-is-running-out-of-men-to-recruit/): It\u2019s a brutal but simple calculation: Kyiv is running out of men. US sources have calculated that its armed forces have lost as many as 70,000 killed in action, with another 100,000 injured. While Russian casualties are higher still, the ratio nevertheless favours Moscow, as Ukraine struggles to replace soldiers in the face of a seemingly endless supply of conscripts. \n\n...but they're not giving these videos even close to enough importance, as you've observed as well, that we would expect to be given to them if we would base their supposed importance on the amount of posts being generated on such forums *and* the current manpower situation in Ukraine.\n\n---\n\nThat alone honestly seems fishy to me, so much that *just based on the lack of Western media reports on it, again, alone,* I'd go and say that the importance of such videos is wildly overstated and such opinions of their importance can almost exclusively be found only in places heavily leaning towards Russia.\n\nI'm not saying forced conscription doesn't happen and all of those videos are fakes, but that instead the shock and disbelief regarding what is happening in those videos is not coming from the Ukrainian side, i.e. it's not an issue as large as some seem to portray it. Otherwise, I'd expect that after **2 years** (more or less) of brutal beatings, insults and chases over the rivers, highways and forests the Ukrainians would get sick of it, and we would certainly hear about it.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Honestly, I&#39;ve been wondering about the same thing for quite some time now - what are those videos <em>really</em> showing - but am starting to admittedly approach it from an entirely different angle.</p>\n\n<p>Reddit search is kinda iffy currently, but I remember those videos started appearing sometime around ~2 years ago on URR (so basically almost at the beginning) and don&#39;t believe the rate of appearance of those videos has fallen much in the meantime.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we have our &#39;Western Media&#39; that&#39;s gladly going around interviewing anyone willing to complain from the Ukrainian side (can&#39;t remember how many time I&#39;ve read that &#39;It&#39;s worse than hell&#39; on the frontlines anymore), yet we have, as you&#39;ve observed, basically radio silence on this issue.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also an ongoing manpower crisis on the Ukrainian side, and important to mention, <em>not the first one according to our own media</em>: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://mwi.westpoint.edu/time-is-not-on-kyivs-side-training-weapons-and-attrition-in-ukraine/\">Time Is Not on Kyiv\u2019s Side: Training, Weapons, and Attrition in Ukraine, June 2022</a>: Each anecdote by itself a data point, but together they tell a story that belies the relentless optimism that has pervaded Ukrainian representation of the war from the outset. After four months of grinding attrition, the Ukrainian army is facing a manpower shortage.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/as-ukraine-loses-troops-how-long-can-it-keep-up-the-fight-/6603860.html\">As Ukraine Loses Troops, How Long Can It Keep up the Fight?, June 2022</a>: &quot;The problem is recruiting, training and getting them on the front line,&quot; said retired U.S. Marine Col. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2023/03/19/wp-ukraine-short-of-skilled-troops-and-munitions-as-losses-pessimism-grow/\">WP: Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow, March 2023</a>: Such grim assessments have spread a palpable, if mostly unspoken, pessimism from the front lines to the corridors of power in Kyiv, the capital.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/\">Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow, March 2023</a>: Same as above, actual source</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/08/22/ukraines-army-is-running-out-of-men-to-recruit/\">Ukraine\u2019s army is running out of men to recruit, and time to win, Victory may be in sight for Vladimir Putin, August 2023</a>: It\u2019s a brutal but simple calculation: Kyiv is running out of men. US sources have calculated that its armed forces have lost as many as 70,000 killed in action, with another 100,000 injured. While Russian casualties are higher still, the ratio nevertheless favours Moscow, as Ukraine struggles to replace soldiers in the face of a seemingly endless supply of conscripts. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...but they&#39;re not giving these videos even close to enough importance, as you&#39;ve observed as well, that we would expect to be given to them if we would base their supposed importance on the amount of posts being generated on such forums <em>and</em> the current manpower situation in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>That alone honestly seems fishy to me, so much that <em>just based on the lack of Western media reports on it, again, alone,</em> I&#39;d go and say that the importance of such videos is wildly overstated and such opinions of their importance can almost exclusively be found only in places heavily leaning towards Russia.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying forced conscription doesn&#39;t happen and all of those videos are fakes, but that instead the shock and disbelief regarding what is happening in those videos is not coming from the Ukrainian side, i.e. it&#39;s not an issue as large as some seem to portray it. Otherwise, I&#39;d expect that after <strong>2 years</strong> (more or less) of brutal beatings, insults and chases over the rivers, highways and forests the Ukrainians would get sick of it, and we would certainly hear about it.
