It's an abbreviated dumbed down version of their own basic training that can't be failed relying entirely on interpreters to assist with translation, sentence to sentence. They're not using TTPs the Ukrainians commonly use. They're not using equipment they often will have. They're using their own stuff their own doctrine and imparting it on the Ukrainians. It's not great. Even by the admission of the Times article, they're talking about junior enlisted soldiers going through a whopping four weeks of training. Anyone wondering what four weeks gets ya, it's crap. It's almost criminally negligent.\n\nMeanwhile, a whole lot of Ukrainians have said the UAF is too Soviet. Who is saying it? The Ukrainians who \"drank the Koolaid,\" who have more modern views on warfare, organization, training, professionalism, leadership that aren't originating from the Soviet-Russia-Ukraine style that permeates their military, especially since they quadrupled or possibly quintupled in size in under two years, not even counting the horrific casualties they took against the prewar cadre. The UAF is now absolutely brimming with Soviet era/Post'91-Pre'15 old school military veterans who are back in the military again doing what they know, which is probably not correct. \n\nLastly, and this is just a hunch of mine based on a year plus of reporting. It's quite possible what this article and what others like Kofman et al repeatedly describe about inability for battalion and higher coordination could just be what the Ukrainians mean by \"we practice Mission Command.\" This very well might be their version of it, extreme decentralization to the point that the Germans themselves can't even recognize it anymore. \n\nThink about it. You're a not very well trained Ukrainian officer, with no formal military science education or lengthy period of quality command and staff assignments. You're being bombarded by messaging from Zaluzhny on down that the UAF practices Mission Command, and to give initiative to the lower level commanders. If you didn't know any better than means you give a very brief order to subordinates and then leave them alone to execute the order as they see fit, only getting involved to check on them every so often and to give them what they say they need. And as commanders at different levels do that, it eds up being a bunch of platoons and companies fighting their own fight, without control by higher commanders. Which is exactly what's being reported.\n\nBut it's far more nuanced than that. I know that from years of reading about this stuff. First about how awesome Auftragstaktik was, then about its faults that fewer talk about, then about how the Germans often didn't use it themselves. But would they know that? How would they know how to do it right, the hard decisions when to give freedom and when not too? Who taught them?",

The decision to reinforce Bakhmut and not retreat was made in late February. By early March, DOD discord leaks reveal the Ukrainians only had about 9k artillery shells left in the whole country, having blown through them in previous offensive, grinding in Luhansk for two months, and then Bakhmut August to February. So when they were in ABSOLUTE dire straits, they made the decision to commit more. \n\nThe US bailed them out with an immediate resupply of ~30k shells from our strategic stockpile, then more over the winter and spring. Not enough, especially considering the fight in Bakhmut didn't end until May, and their tactical situation was ever worsening requiring heavy fires just to survive. \n\nWhen the offensive started this summer, they didn't have enough ammo to continue, that's why Biden unlocked DPICM. Sullivan said it, Mike Kofman has said it, countless credible individuals have said it. They didn't have enough ammo for a long campaign, especially not one that was fires heavy. \n\nMany are blushing blaming NATO for that, saying they didn't give Ukraine exactly what they wanted, a blank check. I call bullshit on that, Ukraine has a responsibility too, and economy of force is a principle of warfare for a reason. Actions have consequences.\n\n2) Ukraine was forced to rely on brand new brigades of dubious quality for their offensive. That was a deliberate decision, but even if they wanted to use their higher quality veteran brigades (many of which are nearly division in size), most are recovering from the Bakhmut meatgrinder. Feel free to disagree with me, Mike Kofman and Rob Lee both ranted about this exact issue in their latest podcasts on The Russian Contingency. \n\nThe Ukrainians knew they were going to launch a spring summer offensive since early winter at the latest. They were obligated to prepare for it, correct? Isn't that the purpose of a strategic level commander in chief of an armed forces? And their general staff? To bother planning for future operations and then taking the steps to implement the plan? \n\nPart of planning for future ops requires having the manpower and supply to carry it out, and that often requires slowing the OPTEMPO and even refusing battle sometimes to be in a better position for the future. FFS, that's the whole reason modern armies typically slow down operations in the winter, so they can conserve and be ready for the fighting when the weather improves and they're capable of fighting effectively, which means pursuing strategic goals (and I've already told you how Bakhmut factors in terms of strategy)\n\nThere is no real indication the UAF took the planning of this offensive seriously at the strategic level based on their actions so far, and that's unfortunate. At least not based on the reality of the situation, it seems their plan hinged on the Russians' being easy to punch through. \n\nTheir Plan A was clearly based on minimal effort, but when that didn't pan out and the Russians were defending better than ever, they had no means to keep going without more foreign aid, specifically artillery. \n\nWhy? Because they didn't focus on minimizing OPTEMPO in order to preserve their force and stockpile ammo over the winter and spring, they did the exact opposite actually. They chose, AGAINST THE ADVICE OF THEIR ALLIED PATRONS, to fight the most costly campaign of this war. They took that risk and then lost anyway. \n\nLuckily they've gotten bailed out, much more ammo to the point they'll be able to fire more than they ever have. But their own failures caused that bailout, not their success. Their failure to plan triggered more aid, because the West is knee deep in Sunken Costs associated with this war and especially this offensive.\n\n>I am not convinced the published casualty ratios were just propaganda and we will never be certain about that.\n\nThe UAF claimed casualty rate, of some nonsense like 7:1, was definitely propaganda. What we do know is the vast vast majority of the Russian casualties involved in the Bakhmut campaign were Wagner and not the Russian military. And of the Wagner losses, most were convicts, literally cannon fodder. Even a 3:1 ratio in that regard would suck for Ukraine. Meanwhile people that were there from February onwards were saying it was close to 1:1. \n\n>Wagner was definitely weakened although mainly expendable troops. These troops would have been used to reach objective somewhere else if not in Bakhmut.\n\nWhere? More so, how long does it take the corps sized Wagner force to move to that other sector and start attacking in force? How long to move it's forces, and equipment, and supplies? How long to run the probing attacks needed just to pinpoint Ukraine defenses and know where the minefields and strongpoints are? The smart time to retreat was March 1, mud season ends by mid May at the latest, giving 2.5 months and then it's UAF offensive time and Wagner needs to keep one eye over it's shoulder. \n\nFurthermore, which other sector in Ukraine gives Wagner an advantage like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqOy_TLWAAA6mzl?format=jpg&name=large) thanks to the tactical situation?

For Ukraine, Bakhmut&#39;s supply lines were westerly and northerly, and thus losing Klishchiivka in the southwest was much more dire for them. Make sense?</p>\n\n<p>Not sure why this was unclear.</p>\n</div>",

Some military bloggers write that the aim is to hit Borova, we are also inclined to this opinion.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, it sounds like he has direct sources confirming this information for him based on how authoritatively he&#39;s speaking about these changes. His credibility would be destroyed if turned out he was wrong about this. There are allegedly ongoing stabilization measures, but he claimed yesterday that &quot;the enemy was finally stopped and even repulsed in some landings&quot; near Novoyehorivka and promptly updated the map with a 40 square kilometer Russian advance today. We&#39;ll see if they can stop them in the second line of defense.</p>\n</div>",

Now fierce battles are going on in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Soldiers of the RF Armed Forces block the columns of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the support of artillery, mortars, ATGM crews and aviation. According to the Zaporozhye Front, at least 20 pieces of equipment have already been destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, another group has advanced from Novodanilovka on eight armored vehicles and tanks and is moving south to support the attacking forces with a second wave. Judging by the interception, units of the 118th Ombre of the 10th AC of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are participating in the assault.</p>\n\n<p>This indicates the use of reserves in the attack and indicates, on the one hand, the imminent full-scale offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and, on the other hand, the depletion of other brigades that previously participated in the battles near Rabotino.</p>\n\n<p>Rapid activation is also confirmed by the activity of 10 AA compounds in other areas. To the west, in Lobkove, the forces of the 3rd battalion of the 118th brigade began to occupy the lines, and detachments of the 117th brigade appeared near Belogorye. In addition, engineering formations of the 48th engineering brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with Western-made pontoon stackers arrived in Sladkoye.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Edit]</p>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TuiteroMartin/status/1684116414733451264\">brief drone footage</a> has emerged, which shows two disabled Bradleys and a tank.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Michael O'Leary has given an interview to Interfax Ukraine where he discusses the plans Ryanair have been developing for a possible resumption of civilian flights to Ukraine (based on how they operate flights to and from Israel with their own security risks), during his visit to the country: he claims that the \"most likely\" scenario is a small number of flights resuming by as soon as the year's end. A few relevant extracts (interview was originally published in Ukrainian but this is an auto-translation):\n\n>**Can you provide any details of what was discussed at these meetings?**\n\n>Of course! We presented the minister with a plan to restore aviation in Ukraine. According to it, we undertook, if EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) confirms the opening of the sky and the airports have a competitive cost, we will provide 5 million passenger seats on airplanes in Ukraine in the first year. Within six weeks after the restoration of the sky, we consider it possible to connect Kyiv with 25 European cities.\n\n>**You say 25 cities... Instead, the official press release mentioned 20 cities...**\n\n>Yes, it will be about 20 or 25 European cities on flights from Kyiv, about 10 - from Lviv, and the next 5 cities - from Odesa. And it will be possible literally six weeks after the opening of the sky.\n\n...\n\n>**Was this also discussed at the meeting with government officials and representatives of Ukrainian airports?**\n\n>Mainly, we discussed today how exactly the Ukrainian aviation sector will be restarted. Maximum plan: 5 million passengers in the first year, growth to 10 million passengers within five years. But everything can be more complicated... It may not be possible to open all of Ukraine on the first day. Ukraine works in this direction with experts from Israel and their experience. But it may not be 5 million passengers in the first year. We may have to operate fewer flights. And then we need to work with the airport to discuss whether we can, for example, operate five flights or ten flights to Kyiv. Currently, we have to determine which airports we need, which routes will be the first priority. We are working to first offer the routes they want (Ukrainian authorities - IF-U).\n\n>Thus, we are considering two plans: one, when the war is over and everything will open in one or two days. And the second, the most likely, according to which we can plan a small number of flights already at the end of this year. Can we convince the European security authorities and the Ukrainian authorities that the flights will be safe, that they can protect the plane from drones, missiles and the like, as is happening in Israel? The Ukrainian authorities are working with the right people to try to reopen the airspace, but there is nothing we can do unless they convince EASA, the European Safety Agency and insurance companies that it is safe to operate the limited number of flights to Kyiv and Lviv.\n\n>**Will one word from EASA be enough to open the sky over Ukraine?**\n\n>So. I mean, if the agency says it's safe, then there's no reason not to return flights to Ukraine. We were the second largest airline in Ukraine before the full-scale Russian invasion. And when this is a thing of the past, we intend to become the largest airline in Ukraine, because we have planes. We can sell tickets through the site, quickly filling flights to Ukraine. Planes of \"International Airlines of Ukraine\" (UAI), for example, are stuck on the ground. They will all require certain maintenance procedures before they can return to the air. All of our aircraft are in good working order.\n\n>All we need to do is return them to Ukraine. We are interested in cooperation with Ukrainian airports, in particular with Boryspil and Lviv airports, and we want to start without delay.\n\n...\n\n>**It is unlikely to be possible before the end of the Russian shelling, or am I not fully understanding correctly?**\n\n>On the contrary, it is possible. Look at what the Israeli government is doing. We (Ryanair - IF-U) operate in Israel and beyond. We fly to Tel Aviv airport. From time to time rockets are fired from the West Bank and Hamas launches rockets. So, anything is possible. But it is necessary to convince the European security authorities that the flights will be safe. The authorities must show that they can protect the flights bound for Kyiv and Lviv, because without this the security agencies and insurance companies will not allow the flights. Ukraine must demonstrate that it is safe and can protect flights. If they can do that, then the Europeans will say it's safe - and we'll be back literally within six weeks.\n\n>**Eurocontrol gave a very pessimistic forecast - according to their estimates, restrictions on air flights to/from Ukraine will remain until 2030. Do you disagree with this assessment?**\n\n>This will change very quickly because Eurocontrol is not an accurate forecaster. No one knows what will happen with the war. I think we should be optimistic. Currently, the Ministry (Ministry of Reconstruction - IF-U) is working to restore some flights to Kyiv and Lviv at the end of this year. And if they can prove it's safe, we'll do those flights. The planes land every day in Tel Aviv, which is only a 10-minute drive from the West Bank, from where the rockets are launched. It was determined that it is safe to fly and they (local authorities - IF-U) can protect the plane. Therefore, I see no reason why we cannot return flights (to Ukraine - IF-U). The only question is whether we will return with a small number of flights or whether it is a large-scale opening of the skies. That is, are we going to implement the big plan, namely 5 million passengers in the first year. I would prefer if we had 5 million passengers in the first year. However, this requires a cease-fire, or a victory, or an end to the war.\n\n>**Do you allow such a scenario, in which EASA will allow flights only from some airports, for example, from Uzhgorod or Lviv, while restrictions will remain for the rest?**\n\n>It is possible. They can give permission for flight corridors on specific flight routes from Kyiv and Lviv. At the moment, Kyiv seems quite safe, it seems quite well protected.\n\n>Life here continues as usual. Trains run, buses run. So, anything is possible. But the Ukrainian authorities have the task of convincing the European authorities. I think that the official representatives of Europe and the USA are interested in the restoration of air traffic in Ukraine. Obviously, there is a huge risk of return flights. No one can allow a repeat of the fate of the Malaysian Airlines plane, which was shot down by the Russians.\n\nhttps://interfax.com.ua/news/interview/924317.html",

Here are several articles from earlier this year on [how Vietnam is positioning itself](https://thediplomat.com/2023/04/the-china-factor-in-vietnams-multidirectional-foreign-policy/) diplomatically and [why an upgrade in US-Vietnam ties is not going to happen](https://thediplomat.com/2023/04/is-a-us-vietnam-strategic-partnership-likely-to-happen-soon/) (Note that, as the article correctly predicted, Vietnam indeed did not upgrade its ties with the US in April). \n\nTLDR, Vietnam is and always has been quite vulnerable to Chinese displeasure, be that economic or military. The two countries share a great deal of trade and investment, and the PLA enormously outclasses the PAVN. Even in prior decades when that was not the case, Vietnam was quite wary of pissing off China simply because it's a large neighbor with a land border (ref. 1979, which however you want to spin it, hurt Vietnam quite a lot). This is not a new phenomenon; it's thousands of years old. China does China stuff, Vietnam treads carefully and keeps its head down. That's not to say that Vietnam is helpless, but its space to maneuver is necessarily constrained by its uncomfortable geographic and political position. It extracts what benefits it can from everyone and tries to avoid becoming a target of anyone. But at the end of the day, Vietnam respects Chinese redlines because it knows what happens when it doesn't. And becoming a US military ally is very much a red line.\n\nEDIT: Here's a fun fact to illustrate the long legacy of Sino-Vietnamese relations and the weight of Chinese influence. The name \"Vietnam\" itself was issued by the Jiaqing Emperor of China in response to Nguyen Anh's petition to name his new country. Nguyen Anh initially asked for \"Nam Viet,\" the ancestral name of the original kingdom, but was refused because it had ruled parts of Guangdong and Guangxi. So the characters of Nam Viet (\u5357\u8d8a) were reversed to make a new name without the historical baggage, Vietnam (\u8d8a\u5357).",

Even in prior decades when that was not the case, Vietnam was quite wary of pissing off China simply because it&#39;s a large neighbor with a land border (ref. 1979, which however you want to spin it, hurt Vietnam quite a lot). This is not a new phenomenon; it&#39;s thousands of years old. China does China stuff, Vietnam treads carefully and keeps its head down. That&#39;s not to say that Vietnam is helpless, but its space to maneuver is necessarily constrained by its uncomfortable geographic and political position. It extracts what benefits it can from everyone and tries to avoid becoming a target of anyone. But at the end of the day, Vietnam respects Chinese redlines because it knows what happens when it doesn&#39;t. And becoming a US military ally is very much a red line.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Here&#39;s a fun fact to illustrate the long legacy of Sino-Vietnamese relations and the weight of Chinese influence. The name &quot;Vietnam&quot; itself was issued by the Jiaqing Emperor of China in response to Nguyen Anh&#39;s petition to name his new country. Nguyen Anh initially asked for &quot;Nam Viet,&quot; the ancestral name of the original kingdom, but was refused because it had ruled parts of Guangdong and Guangxi. So the characters of Nam Viet (\u5357\u8d8a) were reversed to make a new name without the historical baggage, Vietnam (\u8d8a\u5357).</p>\n</div>",

It's possible, however, that some kilometers on the border of the areas of responsibility are manned by TDF elements.\n\nI find it very likely that the Russian advance is due to rotation problems, but I assume internal to the 66th Brigade. There has been high-intensity fighting in this area for over a month now, and Russia is employing numerous units - for example, all the maneuver regiments of the 4th Tank Division. The new brigades in that sector were introduced to increase force density, not to replace veteran ones. Although personally the \"new brigade = zero experience\", \"existing brigade = always better\" scheme seems a bit fallacious to me, like when the trend was \"NATO-trained brigade = invincible\". It always depends from case to case. On the quality of the officers, the training of the troops, the availability of equipment, enemy forces, luck. Some new brigades are formed by a veteran battalion for example.\n\nWhen UAF does an inter-brigade rotation, it's because the combat capability of a brigade has already been seriously compromised. Always - otherwise they don't do it. Brigades then do rotations between their own battalions at their operational level and between companies or smaller units at the tactical level.\n\nSoledar was, unfortunately, a fuck up by the 128th Brigade. In early December all of the brigades that had taken part in the Kherson campaign were rushed to the Bakhmut sector, to relieve brigades that had been in the area for some time (such as the 93rd, before it was sent back to Bakhmut two months later) but mainly to increase force density as Bakhmut had become for both sides the most important sector. The 128th, definitely a veteran brigade, suffered heavy losses in Kherson, replenished their ranks with poorly trained men from TDF, and was sent to Soledar in the very month when Russian efforts were concentrated (rightly so, from their pov) toward that town even more than Bakhmut itself. It really suffered a lot of casualties but I have also read Ukrainians reporting that there were instances of lack of discipline in some companies that some officers after the war will have to answer for. The breakthrough of the lines around the Knauf Gips factory got the whole area into trouble, with Wagner managing to take the heights north of Soledar and the Ukrainians having to send in the then-new 46th Brigade to try to salvage what could be saved in a week or so of extremely hard urban clashes in the town center. This brigade fought well and inflicted a lot of casualties on the enemy, but it could not stop the Russian onslaught that by then had gained favorable ground and suffered very heavy losses. The Ukrainians (too) have this vice of replenishing losses in brigades by using poorly trained personnel, and often this problem affects a part of the \"old\" brigades (the less famed ones) rather than the new brigades. I wrote \"vice\", in reality they often had no choice, but sometimes this made them pay the price harshly. Both in terms of loss of territory and men.",

But based on what I can observe, I tend to agree with Grau (I didn't know him).\n\nThe Russians throughout the South are giving stubborn resistance across the contact line. In some places with quite a lot of success, in others with little, but still they are doing what is possible to them and as far ahead as they can. If they retreat it's because they are being forced to do so by the Ukrainians or because a position behind them is tactically more defensible (e.g., something we might see soon in Novodonetske). The whole \"lol you haven't even reached the actual first line\" debate doesn't make that much sense. The most developed static defense lines have indeed yet to be reached, but Russia is doing what it can to prevent the Ukrainians from reaching them. Okay, on the one hand fighting as far ahead as possible is safer for the hold of the front, but the Russians also have heavy losses, and we know about their situation when it comes to reserves. Right now they would not have enough units to defend the rear lines if by absurd the Ukrainians were to break through. I understand that having multiple undermanned lines to be filled when it's deemed convenient to is one of the pillars of maneuver defense, but I still see too many theoretical differences.\n\nAs the image in the PDF you linked to shows, a maneuver defense would require a space of 50 kilometers, in the Eastern Front of WW2 a Soviet Front (I mean the Army Group) had defenses that extended to a depth of 150 km... If we take into account that from Robotyne to Melitopol there are about 70 km, we can see that particularly in the South I don't see the physical space for such a defense. In my opinion these are theories developed looking at the events in the Eastern Front of WW2 when there were days in which the Germans or Soviets advanced dozens of kilometers. In this war even in Kharkiv in September there were no such advances. The only exception being the first week of the war. Theories later refined for an hypothetical WW3, which would, however, have seen far more resources and manpower than this war as well as much broader and deeper strategic objectives.\n\nIn Robotyne of course both sides often attack and counterattack. As also between Rivnopil and Pryyutne. It's known that the Russians use mobilized and BARS to hold the lines, then they counterattack with regulars, naval infantrymen, even detachments of Spetsnaz GRU... The Ukrainians advance 2 km, the Russians push them back 1,5 km, the next day the Ukrainians recover 1 km, and so on. In this sense yes, the defenses are more mobile than one might think at first notice - there is no single mega trench that the Russians defend to the death against hordes of bayonet-charging Ukrainians. But actually such stuff was already common in non-mechanized contexts such as WW1, let alone now. \n\nLet's also say that one of the purposes of maneuver defense is to buy time, but the Russians are not interested in that in the South. They want to prevent the Ukrainians from reaching Azov Sea at any cost, as that would be the real unrivaled game-changer in this war at the strategic level. Also, another purpose is to mess up the enemy's logistics, which makes sense if the enemy has to advance like 100 km in a hostile environment, but I doubt that this can apply to the Ukrainians in this context. I really don't know if what we are seeing can fit into that definition, to conclude.",

I will summarize his thoughts below. Views expressed are not mine, but his. \n\n1.) He believes a war between China and India is imminent or at least highly probable. He believes that the recent US-India summit has increased this probability. He also believes that if such a war occurs, Pakistan would join in on China\u2019s side. Alternatively, Pakistan could go to war with India and China could simply sit back and utilize non-kinetic assistance to tip the scales. \n\n2.) He states that China has created 6 domains of warfare: Land, Sea, Air, Space, Cyber, and EW. \n\nHe states that the Cyber and EW domains are designed to disrupt communication between theatre commands of the enemy and create an \u2018informatized\u2019 warfare where AI is used to essentially recreate a more significant \u2018fog of war\u2019. He views China as the leading entity in this regards and states that ICET is aimed to improve America\u2019s capabilities and quickly get India up to speed. \n\nIndia remains behind in his view, with an outdated battle concept and only a 3 domain view. As a result China retains total dominance in the 3 non-kinetic domains of warfare. The analyst does not view India as a true competitor of China nor a geostrategic player on the level of Russia or the U.S. \n\n3.) He argues that India is simultaneously the cornerstone of Biden\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy and its weakest link. It is the poorest country in the Quad with a highly outdated and under equipped military. It also occupies a key geostrategic location, particularly in the Maritime domain where it can quite easily intercept China\u2019s sea lines of communication and commodities trade. Because of this an Indo-Pacific strategy on the part of the US cannot exist without India playing a major role. Likewise because of this, it makes little sense for China to attack Taiwan but makes tremendous sense for China to attack India. \n\nHe states that America has and is expecting India to take on a significantly larger military role within the region and expresses serious doubts about India\u2019s capability to do so. \n\n4.) He states that China and Pakistan have achieved true interoperability and interchangeability. He states that PLA officers and troops have been spotted along the Pakistan-India Line of Control and that senior Pakistani military officers are embedded within China\u2019s Western Theater Command. \n\n5.) He states that if Pakistan were to go to war with India, China would intervene on Pakistan\u2019s side through the utilization of the Space, Cyber, and EW domains where India is lagging and that as a result India could very well lose.",

Not least of which because the disputed islands, and in particular the Spratlys, have a major untapped oil potential. It could secure Chinese energy independence in ways that even Russia cannot, because China would control its own energy.\n\nThe issue is that there cant be just a China-Vietnam war again. Vietnam and the PRC arnt the only two to lay claim to these islands, nearly all are claimed by the SRVN, PRC, ROC, Philippines, and I believe Indonesia lays claim to some of the southern ones.

            "body": "IMHO there's a variety of reasons, operational, strategical and political. I think this is one of those cases where Western assessment has been based too much on Soviet (and post-Soviet) military doctrine and too little on understanding the wider strategic framework within which Russia operates, and the overwhelming influence of these factors on military decisions.\n\nAt this point it seems rather unlikely that either the Russian military command or an important pro-war faction in the government might persuade Putin that they have a realistic chance at reaching the original goals of the war -- a successful takeover of Kyiv, followed by a disbandment of the Ukrainian army and imposing a Russian-aligned post-occupation regime -- within a short timeframe. The most realistic short-term course is a peace settlement around the most favourable demarcation lines they can achieve.\n\nConsequently, one of the short-term operational goals is to secure territorial lines that are easily defensible, can be safely and amply supplied, and are favourably positioned for a future resumption of military operations (i.e. a \"second special military operation\" to be launched if Russia manages to rebuild a sufficiently strong force before Ukraine manages to secure meaningful security guarantees).\n\nThis is, in part, informed by basic military considerations, but it's also backed by a very long tradition of Soviet \"buffer territory\" doctrine. The land bridge to Crimea, a major strategic objective for Russia in the Black Sea region not only on account of its ground connection, but also -- if not mainly -- on account of the strategic ports along the coast, would not be considered a viable strategic asset if it were confined to a narrow corridor along the coast.\n\nThere is some non-negligible operational sense in defending so far ahead of their main lines in terms of immediate priorities. First, ceding ground would mean ceding some of the logistical network in the South, and possibly approach axes to Mariupol and Berdyansk. Second, while UAF has so far not been very successful at manoeuvre warfare, it's not like the Russian army is significantly better at it. Doctrinally defending over as high a depth as they can, even under unfavourable conditions, makes a lot more sense than trying to pull off a kind of operation they already know they suck at.\n\nBut the wider, more important objectives, are IMHO 1) to secure more favourable frontlines for a future conflict and 2) to avoid further military embarrassment.\n\nThe former is important not only in terms of general military doctrine but also in terms of political manoeuvring. The Russian establishment got a lot of flak for its bloody and ultimately strategically inefficient winter offensive. If that offensive were to be followed by major, even if strategically sound territorial trade-offs, it would significantly complicate the Kremlin's public messaging efforts.\n\nIt's extremely difficult to advocate for freezing a conflict unless you've managed to physically freeze the frontlines for a long period of time. The Kremlin's main line of diplomatic and media offensive in the West -- the Russian army has dug in and it can't be extricated, the Ukrainian offensive has stalled, it's extremely important to reach a peaceful settlement as soon as possible to minimise suffering for Ukrainian civilians and European economies -- wouldn't work with a more flexible defense, even if a more flexible defense would result in fewer Russian casualties. Or, in any case, it would take *longer* to work, it might achieve a frozen frontline, with fewer casualties, but along less certain lines and over a longer period of time, which the Russian government may not have. Economic concerns aside, they're not at war and not under martial law, and they're just 7 months away from a presidential election which they have no constitutional reason to postpone for now.\n\nThe latter is also a major factor, and it's not \"just\" PR. So far, the fiercest, most coherent and most *popular* criticism that the current Russian establishment has received came not from the democratic opposition (most of which is in exile anyway) but from nationalist voices. There's a long and complicated post-Soviet history behind it but tl;dr the Russian opposition is not, generally speaking, anti-war or pro-Ukraine, and Putin's grasp over his electorate is quite brittle under these circumstances. Even the supporters of his most outspoken opponents, like Navalny, don't really disagree with him on major ideological topics. It's nothing like Democrats vs. Republicans, it's not even like factions *within* these parties -- ideologically, they're largely in agreement, disagreements are over state organisation, institutions, corruption and so on. Much of the Russian opposition is dissatisfied with how efficiently Russia is ran and with how the considerable wealth it produces is (re)distributed, not with the Russian government's general aims. Some opposition leaders have slightly \"revised\" their positions on hot topics, largely in order to make themselves more frequentable by Western organisations and leaders, but overall they'd agree that the war is necessary and its aims are important for Russia, they just disagree with how it's been executed.\n\nThis makes it *extremely* important to avoid even the appearance of a military setback, as there's a large sector of the public that might swing their backing otherwise. \n\nSo tl;dr:\n\n* It makes some immediate military sense: the military leadership probably has more faith in their ability to execute this than the theoretically better, but practically riskier alternative, and there are major objectives worth protecting\n* It ensures better demarcation lines in case of a hypothetical peace settlement, or even a temporary armistice\n* It's politically important for the Russian establishment not to cede ground in Ukraine, even if it makes military sense\n* There is a historical tradition of Soviet and post-Soviet thought that makes this stiff defense very easy to advocate for in the higher echelons\n\nEdit: I dwelled on longer-term objectives for too long to mention the other obvious aspect. It's certainly true that a more mobile defense is *generally* a better approach. However, it's also true that, despite its risks and despite its losses, the stiffer defense employed by the Russisan forces has so far been fairly successful. They've traded relatively little ground for possibly more lives than a mobile approach would've allowed for, but presumably still few enough that they can publicly justify, and scored some PR wins. It remains to be seen if this was the correct choice, especially given the success UAF has had in e.g. counter-battery fire, but when it comes to the immediate, trivial objective of holding ground, it has not been a failure. So far this hasn't been a case of barely-equipped, poorly-trained soldiers getting methodically ran over by a significantly superior force, it's been a slow battle of attrition in which Russia has slowly conceded ground, but has inflicted losses. So all that stuff above shouldn't be read in terms of \"here's why this is a bone-headed strategy that political amateurs have decreed and imposed on professional military leaders against their better judgement\". My crystal ball is as bad as anyone else's, and I also don't have all the information the Russian (or Ukrainian) commanders have. It *might* work, and ten years from now, when we'll have the benefit of hindsight, the short answer might also be well, it was the right thing to do.",

            "body": "Counterbattery has been an absolute essential for offensive operations since 1914. The battle of the Somme failed largely for the reason it didn't prioritize counterbattery. \n\nTo successfully fight Russia requires finding a way to defeat their strengths.The greatest Russian strength in this war, offensive and defensive, is their fires, predominantly tube and rocket artillery. Ukraine will have trouble taking out their MLRS because of its range but they'll have a lot more ease hitting artillery pieces here and there. \n\nBy progressing past a suppression effort, temporarily forcing the Russian arty to displace by firing at them, and instead focusing on destruction, permanently removing those capabilities, they're investing in a long term solution, for the effects to pay off exponentially as time goes on and the Russians can't replace their artillery pieces and crew.\n\nI bet my next paycheck the Ukrainians aren't just prioritizing Russian arty, that's just the one they are promoting the most with their information operations campaign (aka propaganda) because either they're having more success with finding and hitting arty.
