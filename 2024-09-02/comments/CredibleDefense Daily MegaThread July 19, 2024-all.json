They were selling directly to Iran, there were no third parties involved.\n\nThe public has just learned about this, but the ABW (Polish equivalent of the FBI) started investigating the matter in 2022 and the CEO was charged in 2023. She faces up to 10 years in prison. Despite the criminal charges, she wasn't fired until a month ago.\n\nHere's a translation of the [full article](https://wiadomosci.radiozet.pl/polska/polityka/news-czesci-do-iranskich-dronow-bojowych-z-polskiej-panstwowej-firmy-ujawniamy-ustalenia-abw):\n\n>## Parts for Iranian Combat Drones from a Polish State-Owned Company: ABW\u2019s Findings Revealed\n>\n>A state-owned company from Pozna\u0144 sold parts that ended up in Iranian Shahed 136 combat drones, investigative journalist Mariusz Gierszewski from Radio ZET discovered. These drones are used by Russians to carry out attacks on Ukraine. The Internal Security Agency (ABW) uncovered the case.\n>\n>### Parts for Iranian Combat Drones from a Polish State-Owned Company\n>\n>In mid-September 2022, when Ukrainian soldiers shot down an Iranian-made combat drone sent by the Russians over Krupiansk in the Kharkiv region, no one suspected that the trail would lead to Poland. Ukrainian services took interest in one of the parts found in the wreckage of the downed drone.\n>\n>Investigative journalist Mariusz Gierszewski from Radio ZET discovered that it was a fuel pump. According to our information, fuel pumps produced by Wytw\u00f3rnia Sprz\u0119tu Komunikacyjnego \u2013 Pozna\u0144 Sp. z o.o., a company owned by the Industrial Development Agency (ARP), were used in Iranian Shahed 136 drones utilized by Russia in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine since 2022.\n>\n>### Drones for Attacking Ukrainian Cities\n>\n>The Iranian Shahed 136 unmanned aerial vehicles are manufactured by Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries Corporation. In the Russian army, they are known as Geran-2. Shaheds carry a warhead with up to 20 kilograms of explosives. Russians use them in the war against Ukraine, mainly for attacking civilian targets. The pumps driving these Iranian combat drones are ordinarily used for civilian purposes in diesel engines.\n>\n>The Pozna\u0144 company's website states that \"WSK Pozna\u0144 is a company with over 100 years of tradition and experience in precision metalworking.\" The company specializes \"in the production of injection apparatus for diesel engines (DPA and DP pumps, DPA, DPS, and DP heads), aircraft equipment (electromechanisms, solenoid valves, and electromagnets), and precision cooperative elements.\"\n>\n>Our findings indicate that WSK Pozna\u0144 sold parts to Iran Motorsazan Company, which manufactures agricultural tractors. Through this channel, the fuel pumps reached Iranian factories producing military drones, subsequently purchased by Russia.\n>\n>### Former President Charged, Faces Up to 10 Years in Prison\n>\n>The Internal Security Agency uncovered the matter, confirmed by the National Prosecutor's Office to Radio ZET. \"The investigation was initiated on July 1, 2022, by the Regional Prosecutor's Office in Pozna\u0144 based on materials provided by the Pozna\u0144 Delegation of the Internal Security Agency. The case was handed over for further proceedings to the Greater Poland Branch of the Department for Organized Crime and Corruption of the National Prosecutor's Office on September 19, 2022,\" wrote prosecutor Przemys\u0142aw Nowak, spokesperson for the National Prosecutor's Office.\n>\n>In February 2023, investigators charged WSK Pozna\u0144 President Renata S. \"In this proceeding, Ms. Renata S. was charged with committing an offense under Article 33, Section 1 of the Act of November 29, 2000, on trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance for state security, as well as for maintaining international peace and security,\" explained prosecutor Nowak in response to Radio ZET. This offense carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. The investigation is ongoing, extended until September 30, 2024.\n>\n>### \"This matter is covered by investigative secrecy\"\n>\n>We contacted the former president of WSK Pozna\u0144 with questions about the case. Renata S. initially agreed to meet and talk with a Radio ZET journalist but later changed her mind and refused to answer. We also asked Pozna\u0144 Wytw\u00f3rnia Sprz\u0119tu Komunikacyjnego for explanations. We inquired about the number of pumps exported and whether they went directly to Iran Motorsazan Company. \"This matter is covered by investigative secrecy,\" WSK Pozna\u0144 replied.\n>\n>When asked about the remedial steps taken after the case was revealed, the company assured that \"every contractor, company, and country to which it intends to sell its products is thoroughly checked each time. The destination country, company, and company owners are verified for any imposed sanctions,\" read the response sent to Radio ZET.\n>\n>### Contact from Iran: ARP Security Bureau Recommendations\n>\n>We found that the Industrial Development Agency (ARP) is preparing a report to the prosecutor's office regarding the lack of appropriate actions by the previous ARP management. The sale of parts used in the production of Iranian combat drones has been under scrutiny by auditors at the Industrial Development Agency in recent weeks. According to our unofficial information, the auditors found that the previous ARP management, despite having knowledge of the charges against the then-president of WSK Pozna\u0144, did not take supervisory or corrective actions in the company. Renata S. was not dismissed from her position; she lost her job only on June 3 of this year.\n>\n>Additionally, auditors examining ARP's actions noted that in June 2023, an individual associated with the Industrial Development Agency Foundation was contacted by a representative of the Iranian embassy seeking to unblock orders placed at WSK Pozna\u0144. This information reached the ARP Security Bureau. According to our findings, the bureau recommended the then-president of ARP, Cezariusz Lesisz, to refrain from any contacts regarding this matter.\n>\n>Cezariusz Lesisz led the agency from November 2018 to April 2024. He began his political career in the 1980s as an anti-communist activist and co-founder of the Fighting Solidarity. He was the secretary and driver of Kornel Morawiecki, father of former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. In 2017, he became the head of Mateusz Morawiecki's political cabinet when he was still the Minister of Development and Finance. After becoming Prime Minister, Morawiecki appointed Lesisz as the plenipotentiary for economic development, and Lesisz later became head of ARP.\n>\n>We contacted Cezariusz Lesisz with questions about the matter. We did not receive a response before the article's publication.\n>\n>### Deputy Minister of State Assets: \"A Highly Detrimental Matter, Undermining Our Credibility\"\n>\n>As reported by the Western press, a few months before the first Russian attacks on Ukraine using Iranian drones, American intelligence sources and Ukrainian officials claimed that Iran had delivered several hundred drones to Russia, including the Shahed 136 model.\n>\n>According to a report by the independent observer organization Iran Watch, Iran's drone industry is driven by private companies. \"These are not just supply entities or military industry enterprises, although some may have initially originated from there. They are companies with significant human capital and technical knowledge. Some have connections to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, but their ownership and management seem to belong to private citizens. Their efforts have mainly focused on producing components and offering research and development services. Some, but not all, have been sanctioned by the United States and the European Union,\" reads the December 2023 report titled \"The Private Companies Propelling Iran\u2019s Drone Industry.\"\n>\n>We asked the Ministry of State Assets, which oversees the Industrial Development Agency, about supplying parts from Poland used to construct Iranian combat drones.\n>\n>Deputy Minister Robert Kropiwnicki responded to Radio ZET: \"This is an extremely harmful matter for us on the international stage, undermining our credibility. It is scandalous that, on the one hand, we are fighting to support Ukraine, and on the other, we were supplying parts to opponents. There was no oversight from the former ARP management,\" commented Kropiwnicki, adding: \"The matter is closed today and the culprits will be held accountable\"",

An official decision regarding the curfew would be issued soon, the prime minister's press secretary, Nayeemul Islam Khan, told BBC Bangla. Three people were killed in the country on Friday as police cracked down on unrelenting student-led protests against government job quotas despite a ban on public gatherings, local media said.\n\n>Police fired tear gas to scatter protesters in some areas, Reuters journalists said. One said he could see many fires across the capital Dhaka from a rooftop and smoke rising into the sky in several places. Telecommunications were also disrupted and television news channels went off the air. Authorities had cut some mobile telephone services the previous day to try to quell the unrest. Bengali newspaper Prothom Alo reported train services had been suspended nationwide as protesters blocked roads and threw bricks at security officials. Violence on Thursday in 47 of Bangladesh's 64 districts killed 27 and injured 1,500.The total number of those dead from the protests reached 105 on Friday night, AFP separately reported, citing hospitals. Reuters could not immediately verify the reports and police have not issued a casualty toll. The U.S. Embassy in Dhaka said that reports indicated more than 40 deaths and \"hundreds to possibly thousands\" injured across Bangladesh.\n\n>The protests initially broke out over student anger against\u00a0quotas that set aside 30% of government jobs for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan. The nationwide unrest - the biggest since Hasina was re-elected this year - has also been fueled by high unemployment among young people, who make up nearly a fifth of a population of 170 million. Some analysts say the violence is now also being driven by wider economic woes, such as high inflation and shrinking reserves of foreign exchange. The protests have opened old and sensitive political fault lines between those who fought for Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971 and those accused of collaborating with Islamabad. \n\n>The European Union said it is deeply concerned by the violence and loss of life.\"It is vital that further violence is averted and that a peaceful resolution to the situation is found as swiftly as possible, underpinned by the rule of law and democratic freedoms,\" it said in a statement. Neighbour India said the unrest was an internal matter of Bangladesh and that all 15,000 Indians in that country were safe. Violence linked to the protests also broke out in distant London, which is home to a large Bangladeshi population, and police had to quell clashes between large groups of men in the east of the British capital.\n\n>TELECOMS DISRUPTED, WEBSITES HACKED\n\n>Friday began with the internet and overseas telephone calls being crippled, while the websites of several Bangladesh newspapers did not update and were also inactive on social media. A few voice calls went through, but there was no mobile data or broadband, a Reuters journalist said.  Television channels and state broadcaster BTV went off the air, although entertainment channels were normal, he said. Some news channels displayed a message blaming technical problems, and promising to resume programming soon. The official websites of the central bank, the prime minister's office and police appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself \"THE R3SISTANC3\".\"Operation HuntDown, Stop Killing Students,\" read identical messages splashed on the sites, adding in crimson letters: \"It's not a protest anymore, it's a war now.\" Another message on the page read, \"The government has shut down the internet to silence us and hide their actions.\"The government had no comment on the communications issues.On Thursday, it had said it was willing to hold talks with the protesters but they refused.Many opposition party leaders, activists, and student protesters had been arrested, said Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chairman of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Reuters could not confirm the arrests.\n\n>",

Neighbour India said the unrest was an internal matter of Bangladesh and that all 15,000 Indians in that country were safe. Violence linked to the protests also broke out in distant London, which is home to a large Bangladeshi population, and police had to quell clashes between large groups of men in the east of the British capital.</p>\n\n<p>TELECOMS DISRUPTED, WEBSITES HACKED</p>\n\n<p>Friday began with the internet and overseas telephone calls being crippled, while the websites of several Bangladesh newspapers did not update and were also inactive on social media. A few voice calls went through, but there was no mobile data or broadband, a Reuters journalist said.  Television channels and state broadcaster BTV went off the air, although entertainment channels were normal, he said. Some news channels displayed a message blaming technical problems, and promising to resume programming soon. The official websites of the central bank, the prime minister&#39;s office and police appeared to have been hacked by a group calling itself &quot;THE R3SISTANC3&quot;.&quot;Operation HuntDown, Stop Killing Students,&quot; read identical messages splashed on the sites, adding in crimson letters: &quot;It&#39;s not a protest anymore, it&#39;s a war now.&quot; Another message on the page read, &quot;The government has shut down the internet to silence us and hide their actions.&quot;The government had no comment on the communications issues.On Thursday, it had said it was willing to hold talks with the protesters but they refused.Many opposition party leaders, activists, and student protesters had been arrested, said Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chairman of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Reuters could not confirm the arrests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

[The same case was made months ago](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/23/politics/concern-biden-administration-houthi-strikes/index.html) and this administration chose to continue with dynamic targeting limited only to present and imminent threats as they popped up.\n\n>The Houthis are also extremely concerned about their senior leadership being targeted in a strike and have become increasingly paranoid, two officials said.\n\n>For some former US officials who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, the fact that the US has not yet hit Houthi leadership and has instead focused on destroying weapons and equipment is a large part of why the US has failed to meaningfully deter the group.\n\n>\u201cThe US campaign against the Houthis appears to bear the hallmarks of many of these highly circumscribed, scrubbed campaigns of the past where we seek to avoid causing them actual pain,\u201d said one former US military official.\n\n>Former officials point to the apparent success the administration has had in deterring Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria by striking their leaders. After these militants killed three Americans in Jordan in January, the US carried out a strike inside Baghdad on February 7 that killed two key militia commanders. The attacks have since stopped entirely, the Pentagon has said. Officials also believe Iran instructed the groups to back off the attacks following the US strikes.\n\nAs I said at the time, either we need to be comfortable with this not being over any time soon or we pick up the tempo of operations. The analogy of what we have been doing is managing a bucket sitting under a running faucet in which we have punctured a small hole. We could either puncture a much bigger hole or stop the water from filling the bucket. It's much easier and less costly in the long run to puncture a big hole. \n\nIn terms of the Russians, people will be well served to keep one thing in mind. AShMs can be used on ground targets. They are less precise than ALCMs. Guess who could be in the range of those missiles? The Saudis and Israelis (depending on the type we're talking about). I am sure the Saudis who have been propping up oil prices will appreciate Russia supplying missiles to the Houthis. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the Houthis have attacked close to a dozen ships carrying Russian goods [and ships carrying aid to the Houthis](https://www.reuters.com/world/greek-ship-attacked-red-sea-by-houthis-arrives-aden-with-cargo-2024-02-20/)\n\n>The Sea Champion, which was ferrying corn from Argentina to Aden, the seat of Yemen's internationally recognised government, was attacked twice on Monday, with a window damaged but no crew injuries, Greek shipping ministry sources said.\n\n>The U.S. Central Command said the Sea Champion has delivered humanitarian aid to Yemen 11 times in the past five years.\n\n>A port source in Aden and a separate shipping source said the vessel was unloading part of its cargo of some 9,229 tonnes of corn in Aden, before it heads to the northern Yemeni port of Hodeidah, an area controlled by the Houthis, where it was meant to discharge the remaining load of some 31,000 tonnes.\n\n>The port source in Aden, who declined to be identified, said the attack on the vessel was a mistake. A separate port source in Hodeidah, who also declined to be identified, said the Houthis informed them that the attack was not intentional.\n\n[And the time they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran](https://www.reuters.com/world/ambrey-says-bulker-was-targeted-by-missiles-bab-al-mandab-2024-02-12/)\n\nIf anyone had any doubts about who the Houthis are and what they want, this is their motto\n\n>\"God Is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam\"",

None are good, but the first has major costs associated with it like completely stopping shipping for at least a few weeks (who's going to transverse a war zone, even if the US and Israel says it's safe?). Truthfully the second has been reasonably successful so far in keeping shipping moving, but there are questions of sustainability. The 3rd is the hardest, but can be pursued at basically no cost to the current status quo.\n\nEdit: I'm not engaging people who have tried on **multiple** occasions to try and twist \"switch to low intensity operations\" into \"withdraw completely,\" particularly posts with loaded language like \"Biden has been pressuring Israel to surrender\" that's just plain obvious misinformation (The US has been one of the few countries defending a military response to Oct 7, provided offensive armaments to pursue said campaign, and blamed every failure of negotiations on Hamas).",

Truthfully the second has been reasonably successful so far in keeping shipping moving, but there are questions of sustainability. The 3rd is the hardest, but can be pursued at basically no cost to the current status quo.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;m not engaging people who have tried on <strong>multiple</strong> occasions to try and twist &quot;switch to low intensity operations&quot; into &quot;withdraw completely,&quot; particularly posts with loaded language like &quot;Biden has been pressuring Israel to surrender&quot; that&#39;s just plain obvious misinformation (The US has been one of the few countries defending a military response to Oct 7, provided offensive armaments to pursue said campaign, and blamed every failure of negotiations on Hamas).</p>\n</div>",

Extra maintenance costs in stealth aircraft then come from a combination of these two important aspects of stealth. The moving parts of the plane (wheel wells, weapons bays etc) need to stay in perfect alignment to maintain the needed geometry, most likely at much higher tolerances than 4th gen planes. This increases maintenance hours for checking tolerances and replacing out of spec parts, leading to higher cost. Then you have the RAM coatings, which degrade by air friction and exposure to the elements during flight hours, and need to be reapplied at regular intervals. Much more expensive than a regular paint job on a 4th gen fighter. Now I don\u2019t know the exact ratio of extra cost each of these features contribute, but I do know the only cost you would save with a 4th gen \u201cstealth\u201d fighter would be the extra precision in joints and moving parts.

Kings and Lords used to have to stop wars because they ran out of gold and silver (after doing things like confiscating gold and silver vessels from churches and melt them down). Central Banks allow a state to continue financing wars and burning wealth, production capacity, men, women, and children until absolutely there is nothing left.

Kings and Lords used to have to stop wars because they ran out of gold and silver (after doing things like confiscating gold and silver vessels from churches and melt them down). Central Banks allow a state to continue financing wars and burning wealth, production capacity, men, women, and children until absolutely there is nothing left.
