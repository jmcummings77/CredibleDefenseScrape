But military support the U.S. and its allies have provided Kyiv has shaped what Ukraine is able to accomplish on the battlefield. \n\n>Since Russia massed forces to invade Ukraine in February, the U.S. has gradually expanded the types of weapons it has been willing to provide to Kyiv beyond the shoulder-fired Javelin antitank missiles Ukraine first received during the Trump administration.\n\n>After months of internal discussion about how to provide Stinger antiaircraft missiles that didn\u2019t contain classified equipment, the first Stingers from U.S. stocks arrived in Ukraine in late February shortly after the Russian invasion was under way. U.S.-made Stingers from Baltic nations began to arrive in Ukraine early that month.\n\n>By April, M777 howitzers were being shipped to Ukraine. In May, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Denmark would provide U.S.-made Harpoon antiship missiles and a shore-based launcher to fire them.\n\n>Later that month, U.S. officials said that they would provide wheeled Himars. Those launchers, officials said, would be used to fire the GMLRS, which have roughly twice the range of the howitzers. \n\n>To guard against the risk of escalation, the U.S. secured a commitment from President\n\n>Volodymyr Zelensky that the launchers wouldn\u2019t be used to strike targets on Russian territory. Ukraine has honored that pledge, which Ukrainian officials say shows Kyiv can be trusted with longer-range weapons. \n\n>The Pentagon said in August that it has provided High-speed Anti-Radiation Missiles, or HARM missiles, which Ukraine fires from its Soviet-era fighters to attack Russian radars. \n\n>But the White House has moved cautiously, weighing the military benefit to Kyiv against the risk of escalation with Moscow, in a balance that has left Ukraine without long-range U.S. missiles that can strike \nRussia\u2019s naval headquarters, air force units and logistics in Russian-occupied Crimea or military assets on Russian territory.\n\n>The U.S. has declined to provide Gray Eagle MQ-1C drones amid Pentagon concerns that they could be used to strike targets in Russia.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s hopes of acquiring Western aircraft in the near term have also been rebuffed by the Biden administration, **though the U.S. hasn\u2019t ruled out supplying them years from now after the Ukraine conflict is resolved**.  \n\n>One major system that the Russians have warned Washington not to provide\u2014privately as well as publicly\u2014are long-range, surface-to-surface missiles such as the ATACMS missiles, which can be fired from Himars launchers and could strike well into Russia territory. \n\n>\u201cIf Washington decides to supply longer-range missiles to Kyiv, then it will be crossing a red line and will become a direct party to the conflict,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in September.\n\n>President Biden said in May that the U.S. won\u2019t provide Ukraine with \u201crocket systems that strike into Russia.\u201d\n\n>The Russian demand not to provide ATACMS to Kyiv comes as debate has grown among current and former U.S. and European officials about whether the Biden administration has been too cautious in providing military support to Ukraine. \n\n>That dispute has intensified as Russia has bombarded Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure, to deprive millions of civilians of electricity, heat and water by firing missiles from Russia territory and launching Iranian-made drones from bases in Russian-occupied Crimea with virtual impunity. \n\n>The U.S. and its allies have sought to help Ukraine by bolstering its patchwork of air defenses. But the allied efforts have moved slowly. While Ukrainian officials claim that about 80% of the attacking missiles are shot down, the ones that have gotten through have disabled around 50% of Ukraine\u2019s power grid, though Ukraine\u2019s workers are trying to restore it. \n\n>On one side of the debate are experts such as Charles Kupchan, the top National Security Council official for Europe during the Obama administration, who argues that the U.S. should continue to limit the range and sophistication of the weapons provided to Ukraine, to contain the risk of broader conflict with Russia. \n\n>>\u201cThe United States should avoid encouraging or facilitating a Ukrainian effort to fully expel Russian forces from all of its territory, including Crimea, a war aim that would run too high a risk of prompting [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to undertake even more reckless actions, including the possible use of nuclear weapons,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said.\n\n>The other side includes some former alliance officials.

E. Clifton James successfully impersonated General Bernard Montgomery (\"Monty\") for intelligence purposes during World War II.\n\n> As a result, he was approached by actor David Niven in May 1944.

                    "body": "I'm not even talking about long-range missile defense; Zelensky was spotted in both Kherson and Izyum after both were liberated (Nov and Sept, respectively). Both are in artillery range (I'd wager the former more so). \n\nTo add: there's been a lot of whining on the Russian side for them not striking Zelensky during those ops--not even making a half-assed attempt at a strike. I did see some speculation that local commanders may have ordered a strike while Zelensky was in Kherson, but that it was overruled up the chain. While most Russian whining about this or that issue can mostly be dismissed, they do raise a valid point here.\n\nTo me, it's plain Russia isn't treating Zelensky like Saddam, whom the US targeted again and again during the Iraq invasion; Russian soldiers haven't been issued capture-or-kill playing cards with Ukrainian leadership on them. So we're left to guess why this is the case:\n\n1) It's a conscious decision by Putin et al, for various reasons (to not escalate the war, to not create a martyr, fear of a NATO response, etc)\n\n2) It's Russian incompetence. While Russian precision strikes are rather pathetic and not all as precise as comparable NATO strikes, they are capable of hitting general areas quite effectively (knocking out Ukrainian power day after day takes some precision to do). And these photo ops aren't small events: hundreds of soldiers and staff, with a very visible and identifiable Zelensky in the middle. Either Russia is trying and missing the target zones entirely, or some other comical farce is preventing their launches. I wouldn't completely rule this out; I just place it as a lower probability.\n\nAt the end, we're just left with guesswork. Zelensky lives and not only that, is able to freely traverse to the front--something not usually afforded to modern leaders in modern wars (Saddam being the clearest exemplar of that).",

Now, enforcing the laws and dealing with the <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/11/23/armed-crime-on-the-rise-in-russia-a79473\">increase in crime</a> inside Russia might increase the pressure in the government to turn to solving issues inside the country and taking a step back from propaganda, as it is now kind of veiled behind \u201cwhataboutism\u201d about the West and in a way hiding the issues by not talking about them. </p>\n\n<p>So my question is how much longer can propaganda keep hiding the issues inside without people mobilizing to act or pressure some clarity upon themselves? Especially as more and more people will be returning from the war.</p>\n</div>",

You defend strategic bombers by dispersing them so no one hit can destroy too many of them. You can check the list of old SAC B-52 bases on Wikipedia. It goes on, and on, and on- and those aren't even the dispersal fields!\n\nThe thing about Russian long-range aviation, though, is that the Soviets (who they inherited it from in large part) never took it as seriously as we took SAC. For them, the main striking arm against the main enemy was the missile, and the bombers were some kind of appendix. They didn't drill and practice like SAC, they didn't develop doctrine like SAC, and they didn't spend money like SAC. \n\nThis included on the aircraft themselves (fewer Tu-95 than B-52, many fewer Tu-160 than B-1B, even though production began at the same time), but it also included airfields. The intercontinental types were always concentrated at only 5 airfields, which, when combined with the lack of things like MITO drills, meant that their utility in global thermonuclear war situations was not high.",

        "body": "There was alot of angst directed at Milley when he predicted the war was settling into an attritional slog a few weeks ago, but I think he was correct. The Russians seem to have mobilized enough troops to stabilize their lines, and likely still retain equipment reserves. I don't know that this means a Ukrainian return to Feb 24th lines and beyond is impossible, but it might require a deterioration of RU forces to the point where they either collapse or Russian leadership is forced to make peace from domestic pressure. Both of those look a long ways off right now, so I do think this war has plenty of room left to run. \n\nHowever, gotta wonder what Russian leadership is thinking at this point. Their immediate strategy appeared to be \n\n1. Stabilize the lines and reconstitute for a Spring offensive\n2. Conduct localized offensive against Bakmut and surrounding settlements\n3. Launch strategic strikes against Ukrainian energy infrastructure to apply maximal pressure to the Ukrainian electric/heating grids during winter \n\nI think they've had mixed success across this list, but you get the sense from what the Russians are *doing* that they're still seeking territorial/political concessions from Ukraine beyond what they've already taken. That goal seems widely unrealistic at this point, their best bet was probably a total collapse of the Ukrainian electric grid and at this juncture that does not look likely. Russia's energy war on Europe also has been pretty unsuccessful, to be sure it looks like it'll cause the EU a serious financial headache but it has *not* stopped the flow of military and monetary support to Ukraine.\n\nSo if you're Russia, what exactly are your next steps? It doesn't seem like there's a route to terminate this conflict favorably for them that justifies the immense damage being done to their economy, military, and international standing. What's more, continuation of war means more dead Russians. There is a legitimate political risk here of exhausting the population, although I suspect much of the damage has already been done by the exodus of young, relatively wealthy people to escape the war and draft.\n\nSo in summary, barring some unprecedented reversal for Russia in the war I think they have suffered a serious strategic defeat. From the start of the conflict I think you've seen Russian leadership compensate for a lack of success on the battlefield with strategic political and military plays meant to indirectly shift the conflict in their favor. Ultimately I think their deck of strategic moves is starting to exhaust itself, either because the West was able to adapt (gas embargoes, infrastructure strikes on Ukraine) or because their tools weren't that potent in the first place (cyber attacks). \n\nIf Russian leadership wants to pull this out of the fire I think they'll have to do it on the battlefield, against an AFU still supported materially and fiscally by the West. As we've seen a stabilization/freezing of the line does seem possible if RU is willing to accept the loss, but I think their posturing towards a future offensive indicates Russian leadership is still pursuing maximalist strategic goals for this conflict. I'm very skeptical they retain the material ability to accomplish those goals, and I think this mismatch between goals and reality could prevent them from holding onto what they've taken",

I'm not going to say I'm not rooting for the Ukrainians, I am, but I'm also not making the mistake all the big military think tanks are and giving the Russians way more credit then they deserve.

The answer is simple and prosaic - there are no more airfields in the Russian Federation, the infrastructure of which would be suitable for servicing aircraft of this class on a regular basis. There are a number of airfields capable of receiving strategic bombers for refueling, but not ensuring their operation for a long time - therefore it is physically impossible to disperse the aircraft.\n\nPre-flight service, for example, Tu-160 takes a total of several days, requires a large number of qualified personnel and specialized equipment. In Soviet times, this did not cause great difficulties, but it has long been irretrievably gone, and for modern Russia, the mass organization of such processes is too complicated and expensive.\n\nMoreover, it was never planned to invest resources in expanding the infrastructure of strategic aviation due to the complete lack of expediency.

If you believe that there's 2.5 injured for every 1 dead, which is normal for a modern army, then 1/3.5 of the casualties would be dead, and the rest would be injured.\n\nHaving said that, though, we've also seen many reports suggesting Russia hasn't been that great to their wounded.
