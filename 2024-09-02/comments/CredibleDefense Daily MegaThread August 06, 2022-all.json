I\u2019m going to summarize what I\u2019ve been reading and my understanding; I can drop references if you\u2019re so inclined and when I have time. \n\nRussia\u2019s armed forces total about a million (active duty), but their army is only about 300k. We have seen a lot of Russian effort to recruit volunteers to go into Ukraine with minimal training. Some theorize this is because Russia is only signing up volunteers with infantry experience; others think they\u2019re going to be used as cannon fodder. In any event, reports coming out are saying that Russia is getting somewhere between a third and a half of a BTG per location. While that kind of makes sense given Russia\u2019s BTG strategy (go to war with 2/3rds of a BTG but have the equipment for another 1/3rd, just add troops), it doesn\u2019t make sense when you consider Russia\u2019s casualties. \n\nYes, it\u2019s true that Russia has not undergone a mass mobilization. But it\u2019s not clear that Russia has the capability to draft and train a mass amount of troops; the conscription and training centers of the Soviet era were dismantled in the late 90\u2019s / early 2000\u2019s. And, there\u2019s some concern that a mass mobilization may lead to political instability, similar to what occurred during WW1. \n\nWe have seen Russian units pulled from other locations where, I presume, Russia would have preferred to keep those units in place. Azerbaijan/Armenia, Syria, and Georgia. There was an unsubstantiated rumor (neither confirmed or denied) that Russia pulled units off of the Finland/Russian border and sent those units to Ukraine. \n\nThe bottom line is that Russia\u2019s manpower in Ukraine is suffering, as evidenced by Russia\u2019s own actions. You don\u2019t start volunteer recruiting drives and pull units out of hotspots if you have plenty of manpower available. \n\nAbout equipment, Russia has lost a lot. According to Oryx, Russia has a documented loss of 929 tanks thus far. I don\u2019t care who you are or what you have in reserve; losing the equivalent of over 92 BTG\u2019s worth of tanks hurts a lot. \n\nWe\u2019re also seeing a lot of Russian crowdfunding to get Russian troops things like NVGs and drones. Additionally, Russia approached Iran for drones and asked Bayraktar whether it would sell Russia some drones. \n\nRussia appears to have culminated in Eastern Ukraine. They would be sending more troops and advanced weapons to continue their advance, but they don\u2019t have them. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that the war is close to being over; it means that Russia will continue to throw in more antiquated equipment and insufficiently trained troops because it has no other option at this point.",

        "body": "*It\u2019s an artillery war, but Ukraine still kills tanks with Javelins* \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/05/ukraine-war-javelins-russia-tanks/\n\nNEAR IZYUM, Ukraine \u2014 It turns out, some Ukrainian soldiers discovered, that Javelin cases make great beds. The U.S.-made antitank missiles are packed in large, black rectangular capsules \u2014 perfect for elevating a slim cot off the dirty, cold floors of front-line positions.\n\nAre you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\u201cMake sure you mention they\u2019re empty,\u201d said a soldier, showing off the makeshift beds. \u201cThe last thing we need is Americans thinking they\u2019re sending us Javelins just so we can sleep on them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the opposite, actually: The 93rd Mechanized Brigade had fired so many Javelins at Russian tanks that they needed something to do with the pile of empty cases.\n\nThe fighting in this stage of war between Russia and Ukraine has shifted toward an exchange of long-range artillery and missile strikes. But despite Javelins being a shorter-range weapon \u2014 its maximum range is about 2.5 miles \u2014 soldiers here near Russian-occupied Izyum in northeastern Ukraine still consider Javelins an effective way to inflict punishing damage on Russian troops. Lt. Oleksandr Sosovskyy referred to the weapons as his \u201cgood buddies.\u201d\n\nHe said the Ukrainian and Russian troops in many places are dug in on front lines just a few miles apart \u2014 within Javelin range.\n\n\u201cWe keep burning their vehicles, and that means that a few more houses in Ukraine will stay intact,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren won\u2019t get killed. Civilians and military won\u2019t get killed.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about the role Javelin antitank missiles could play in Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia\n\nFor years, as Ukraine was locked in a simmering conflict with Russian-led separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, Javelin antitank missiles were the premier military aid from Washington \u2014 a defensive, lethal weapon intended to deter greater hostilities. Then, they were kept away from the front line and never used outside of training environments, but already \u201cJavelin\u201d had become part of the lexicon in Ukraine as a symbol of Western support.\n\nAfter Russian tanks actually crossed the border on Feb. 24 \u2014 and some were immediately wiped out with Javelins \u2014 the cult around the weapons grew. \u201cJavelin\u201d \u2014 or \u201cJavelina\u201d for a girl \u2014 is now a common name for pets. Local department stores sell plush Javelin missile toys for children. An internet meme of religious figures cradling Javelins became so popular that its creator started a charity organization selling T-shirts with the images. Ukraine\u2019s defense minister recently wore a \u201cSaint Javelin\u201d patch on his bulletproof vest.\n\nLt. Col. Bohdan Dmytruk is another fan of the anti-armor system. A battalion commander in Ukraine\u2019s 93rd brigade, Dmytruk said he\u2019s seen a decline in the quality of tanks Russians are using on the front lines. He has an intimate understanding of his enemy \u2014 his battalion was fighting the same Russian brigade in the Sumy region, farther north, earlier in the war, and they are now facing off again in the Kharkiv region.\n\nIn Sumy, the 93rd brigade was victorious, expelling Russian forces from the region. In the more than three months that they\u2019ve been posted near Izyum, the front line hasn\u2019t budged much, though Dmytruk said his unit advanced about 5 miles along one part of it during that time. The road to Ukraine\u2019s current trench positions is littered with destroyed Russian vehicles and rotting soldiers\u2019 corpses. The grain fields here have been burned and filled with craters from artillery shells \u2015 sunflowers tend to sprout around their edges.\n\nSunflowers ring a crater created by shelling in a field in Ukraine. (Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post)\nThe tanks the Russians are using now are older, Dmytruk said, because Javelins and similar weapons have depleted their arsenal. Even the crews operating the tanks now are less experienced, often not even managing to fire on Dmytruk\u2019s forces before they\u2019re taken out, he said, because they didn\u2019t properly load the ammunition.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian military basically destroyed their newest tanks and infantry combat vehicles in the first wave of fighting,\u201d Dmytruk said. \u201cThe last vehicle of theirs we damaged just a couple days ago was a BMP-1, which is one of their oldest models. They would\u2019ve had that one sitting in storage for a long time, so they\u2019re really emptying out their stocks right now.\u201d\n\nWashington has provided Ukraine with more than 5,000 Javelins as part of its more than $8 billion in material aid since the start of the Biden administration. In the first days of the war, Javelins were passed around to anyone who spotted an enemy column \u2014 sometimes with on-the-spot instruction.\n\nTwo Russian armored vehicles destroyed by Ukrainian forces, who still use short-range Javelin antitank weapons in a war that is now largely fought with long-range artillery. (Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post)\nBefore the Russian invasion, some Ukrainian servicemembers had attended special sessions with U.S. trainers on how to use the Javelin. But it was nowhere near enough to defend against Russian tank convoys once the war started.\n\nSosovskyy said he watched a 5-minute YouTube video and scanned a 12-point instruction manual \u2014 all while being driven to the spot from where he had to start firing the weapons. The first time, it didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cYou shoot, but something\u2019s not working and then you are trying to learn on your own, with the enemy right there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we figured it out and managed to hit targets, not only would the target get destroyed, but the rest of the convoy would get scared and flee. Javelins helped us quickly get rid of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re like in a cartoon,\u201d Sosovskyy added. \u201cClick-click and it flies.\u201d\n\nAs they wait for weapons, Ukrainians hold the line with Soviet artillery\n\nUsing Javelins and other antitank missiles, such as British NLAW and the Ukrainian-made Stugna-P, now requires more of a hunt. The 93rd brigade uses drones to look for targets. Then small teams \u2014 usually about two people \u2014 move into firing range to take it out with Javelins or NLAWs, which are considered lighter and easier to use but reserved for shorter distances.\n\nMembers of the 93rd brigade have also come up with creative ways to reach the Russians. Dmytruk said his soldiers will sometimes attach a \u201cpresent\u201d \u2014 an antitank grenade \u2014 to a drone that will then drop it on any enemy vehicle.\n\n\u201cRight now, they\u2019re afraid to even walk up to their tanks,\u201d Dmytruk said. He said he\u2019s intercepted audio of some Russian commanders telling their soldiers to fill white bags with dirt and cover the tops of their tanks. Dmytruk said doing that is \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just empty Javelin cases his brigade recycles. If a Russian tank or combat vehicle is lightly damaged and recoverable, the Ukrainians will snag it for themselves. Dmytruk said his battalion alone has destroyed 18 Russian tanks, but five were taken as \u201ctrophies\u201d that Ukrainian soldiers repaired, repainted and redeployed to the front.\n\nA Russian tank is captured by Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian army has repurposed some of the Russian tanks it has captured, returning them to the front lines. (Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post)\nAmong them are two T-80 models parked in thick mud and under the cover of tree branches. They weren\u2019t hit with Javelins \u2014 then they wouldn\u2019t have been salvageable. But with many of their tanks captured, the Russians are turning to older tanks, and the Ukrainians are fighting them with their own newer ones.\n\n\u201cWe can see it by their equipment that they are lacking some,\u201d Sosovskyy said. \u201cWe learn that from intercepted messages or some stories. We see they are panicking, that their reconnaissance is getting weaker. So we are hopeful. And we\u2019ll be doing everything we can to kick them out of here.\u201d",

Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine.\n\u201cMake sure you mention they\u2019re empty,\u201d said a soldier, showing off the makeshift beds. \u201cThe last thing we need is Americans thinking they\u2019re sending us Javelins just so we can sleep on them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the opposite, actually: The 93rd Mechanized Brigade had fired so many Javelins at Russian tanks that they needed something to do with the pile of empty cases.</p>\n\n<p>The fighting in this stage of war between Russia and Ukraine has shifted toward an exchange of long-range artillery and missile strikes. But despite Javelins being a shorter-range weapon \u2014 its maximum range is about 2.5 miles \u2014 soldiers here near Russian-occupied Izyum in northeastern Ukraine still consider Javelins an effective way to inflict punishing damage on Russian troops. Lt. Oleksandr Sosovskyy referred to the weapons as his \u201cgood buddies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He said the Ukrainian and Russian troops in many places are dug in on front lines just a few miles apart \u2014 within Javelin range.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe keep burning their vehicles, and that means that a few more houses in Ukraine will stay intact,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren won\u2019t get killed. Civilians and military won\u2019t get killed.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>What to know about the role Javelin antitank missiles could play in Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia</p>\n\n<p>For years, as Ukraine was locked in a simmering conflict with Russian-led separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, Javelin antitank missiles were the premier military aid from Washington \u2014 a defensive, lethal weapon intended to deter greater hostilities. Then, they were kept away from the front line and never used outside of training environments, but already \u201cJavelin\u201d had become part of the lexicon in Ukraine as a symbol of Western support.</p>\n\n<p>After Russian tanks actually crossed the border on Feb. 24 \u2014 and some were immediately wiped out with Javelins \u2014 the cult around the weapons grew. \u201cJavelin\u201d \u2014 or \u201cJavelina\u201d for a girl \u2014 is now a common name for pets. Local department stores sell plush Javelin missile toys for children. An internet meme of religious figures cradling Javelins became so popular that its creator started a charity organization selling T-shirts with the images. Ukraine\u2019s defense minister recently wore a \u201cSaint Javelin\u201d patch on his bulletproof vest.</p>\n\n<p>Lt. Col. Bohdan Dmytruk is another fan of the anti-armor system. A battalion commander in Ukraine\u2019s 93rd brigade, Dmytruk said he\u2019s seen a decline in the quality of tanks Russians are using on the front lines. He has an intimate understanding of his enemy \u2014 his battalion was fighting the same Russian brigade in the Sumy region, farther north, earlier in the war, and they are now facing off again in the Kharkiv region.</p>\n\n<p>In Sumy, the 93rd brigade was victorious, expelling Russian forces from the region. In the more than three months that they\u2019ve been posted near Izyum, the front line hasn\u2019t budged much, though Dmytruk said his unit advanced about 5 miles along one part of it during that time. The road to Ukraine\u2019s current trench positions is littered with destroyed Russian vehicles and rotting soldiers\u2019 corpses. The grain fields here have been burned and filled with craters from artillery shells \u2015 sunflowers tend to sprout around their edges.</p>\n\n<p>Sunflowers ring a crater created by shelling in a field in Ukraine. (Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post)\nThe tanks the Russians are using now are older, Dmytruk said, because Javelins and similar weapons have depleted their arsenal. Even the crews operating the tanks now are less experienced, often not even managing to fire on Dmytruk\u2019s forces before they\u2019re taken out, he said, because they didn\u2019t properly load the ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Ukrainian military basically destroyed their newest tanks and infantry combat vehicles in the first wave of fighting,\u201d Dmytruk said. \u201cThe last vehicle of theirs we damaged just a couple days ago was a BMP-1, which is one of their oldest models. They would\u2019ve had that one sitting in storage for a long time, so they\u2019re really emptying out their stocks right now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Washington has provided Ukraine with more than 5,000 Javelins as part of its more than $8 billion in material aid since the start of the Biden administration. In the first days of the war, Javelins were passed around to anyone who spotted an enemy column \u2014 sometimes with on-the-spot instruction.</p>\n\n<p>Two Russian armored vehicles destroyed by Ukrainian forces, who still use short-range Javelin antitank weapons in a war that is now largely fought with long-range artillery. (Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post)\nBefore the Russian invasion, some Ukrainian servicemembers had attended special sessions with U.S. trainers on how to use the Javelin. But it was nowhere near enough to defend against Russian tank convoys once the war started.</p>\n\n<p>Sosovskyy said he watched a 5-minute YouTube video and scanned a 12-point instruction manual \u2014 all while being driven to the spot from where he had to start firing the weapons. The first time, it didn\u2019t work.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou shoot, but something\u2019s not working and then you are trying to learn on your own, with the enemy right there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we figured it out and managed to hit targets, not only would the target get destroyed, but the rest of the convoy would get scared and flee. Javelins helped us quickly get rid of them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like in a cartoon,\u201d Sosovskyy added. \u201cClick-click and it flies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As they wait for weapons, Ukrainians hold the line with Soviet artillery</p>\n\n<p>Using Javelins and other antitank missiles, such as British NLAW and the Ukrainian-made Stugna-P, now requires more of a hunt. The 93rd brigade uses drones to look for targets. Then small teams \u2014 usually about two people \u2014 move into firing range to take it out with Javelins or NLAWs, which are considered lighter and easier to use but reserved for shorter distances.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the 93rd brigade have also come up with creative ways to reach the Russians. Dmytruk said his soldiers will sometimes attach a \u201cpresent\u201d \u2014 an antitank grenade \u2014 to a drone that will then drop it on any enemy vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight now, they\u2019re afraid to even walk up to their tanks,\u201d Dmytruk said. He said he\u2019s intercepted audio of some Russian commanders telling their soldiers to fill white bags with dirt and cover the tops of their tanks. Dmytruk said doing that is \u201cuseless.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And it\u2019s not just empty Javelin cases his brigade recycles. If a Russian tank or combat vehicle is lightly damaged and recoverable, the Ukrainians will snag it for themselves. Dmytruk said his battalion alone has destroyed 18 Russian tanks, but five were taken as \u201ctrophies\u201d that Ukrainian soldiers repaired, repainted and redeployed to the front.</p>\n\n<p>A Russian tank is captured by Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian army has repurposed some of the Russian tanks it has captured, returning them to the front lines. (Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post)\nAmong them are two T-80 models parked in thick mud and under the cover of tree branches. They weren\u2019t hit with Javelins \u2014 then they wouldn\u2019t have been salvageable. But with many of their tanks captured, the Russians are turning to older tanks, and the Ukrainians are fighting them with their own newer ones.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can see it by their equipment that they are lacking some,\u201d Sosovskyy said. \u201cWe learn that from intercepted messages or some stories. We see they are panicking, that their reconnaissance is getting weaker. So we are hopeful. And we\u2019ll be doing everything we can to kick them out of here.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

These are usually equated to the US Burkes and Ticos, respectively. China also has YJ-62s and YJ-12s aboard dozens of destroyers, frigates, and missile boats. I don't believe YJ-8s are in service except for some old missiles boats for the PLAN. The same extends to the Yu-4. They made be in use by the oldest PLAN submarines, the Type 35s, but the Yu-6 is their newest development. Supposedly the Chinese equivalent of the US Mark 48 ADCAP. \n\nChina has spent ungodly amounts of money on the PLAN navy surface fleet in the last two decades. I'd say it's safe to assume their fleet is fully equipped. Replenishment may be more of a issue, but if China was to go into a full scale war I wouldn't doubt their ability to manufacture. Nobody in their right mind would, they have the largest industrial base on the planet. \n\nThe only heavy weight torpedo in USN service, as used by submarines, is the Mark 48 ADCAP in various revisions. The LA, Seawolf, and Virginia classes totaled up have storage for ~1,599 torpedoes, if they're fully loaded(with just fish). The Ohio-class have four tubes as well but I don't think numbers have ever been released as to their storage numbers. [This happy picture tells at least 4+4](https://i.redd.it/6oqp1zqhbea91.jpg), but I'd say it's safe to assume something like 4 fish in the tubes and 16 reloads giving 20. That'd give 1,879 maximum across the fleet, likewise I'd assume the USN has at least 1,000 mark 48s in service. You could probably just dig through US budgets and figure out a reasonable number as well.\n\nAs for anti-ship missiles, the US hasn't made a large investment until lately. The USN relies on submarines and air power for anti-shipping. The Harpoon AShM is a **old** missile now, and the US never adopted the Block III/II+ ER variant. The Burke-class destroyers dropped the Harpoon launchers all together in order to have a enclosed hanger for two LAMPS III helos on the Flight IIA ships. The Tomahawk Block Va is the new anti-shipping missile for the USN, usable on any Burke or Tico via the Mark 41 VLS. The previous Tomahawk AShM was retired in 1994. The Block Va is either not deployed yet, or only in very limited numbers. Some of the pitiful LCS ships, Independent and Freedom classes, have the Naval Strike Missile(NSM). The future Constellation-class frigates will likely have NSM AShMs as well. \n\nThe USN has the AGM-88 SLAM-ER, a air launched land attack and anti-shipping derivative of the Harpoon. Probably hundreds of them, if not in the low thousands. The AGM-158C LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile) is the USN's newest and most capable air launched AShM.",

Better to make the Russians *think* you\u2019re going to attempt to liberate Kherson so they cram it full of troops and you can bleed them white.

Plus it\u2019s feasible for Ukraine to establish some kind of local artillery dominance in the region, far more so than in the Donbas.</p>\n\n<p>I could easily imagine a strategy like this being suggested by their NATO advisors: \u201cA full-scale assault on the city would be bloody for both sides and cause large civilian casualties. Better to make the Russians <em>think</em> you\u2019re going to attempt to liberate Kherson so they cram it full of troops and you can bleed them white. If we\u2019re lucky, it could trigger desertions and morale collapse and break the Russian army.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>(Also note Ukrainian Brigadier General Dmytro Krasylnykov\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/volodyatretyak/status/1555633966811648000?s=21&amp;t=5eKQ6jNDpbVzm1aAmnRg8g\">recent comments on the similar difficulties the UAF faced in Lysychansk</a>; this tactic could have been inspired by their negative experiences of being cut off there)</p>\n</div>",
