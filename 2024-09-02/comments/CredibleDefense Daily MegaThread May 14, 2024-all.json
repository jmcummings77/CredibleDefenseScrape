As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Dedicated to the history of this drone is the recent article by [Ukrainska Pravda](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2024/05/13/7455462/). However, besides Liutyi, there are other drones famed for strikes on Russian military bases and infrastructure.*\n\n*For example, drones with an attack range of 800 km, namely, the Bober UAV developed thanks to the crowdfunded Black Box project and known for its strikes on Moscow City, or the Morok operated by the Security Service of Ukraine. But the most capable of these developments responsible for the record-breaking 1,400+ km strike has been shrouded in mystery.

However, in terms of the price/quality/range/accuracy ratio, Liutyi still holds a confident leadership,\" notes the author of the article.*\n\n*Based on the name alone, it's quite difficult to guess what kind of drone this Ninja might be. The video showing the attack on the oil refinery in Bashkiria features a UAV that looks more like a small civil aviation aircraft rather than conventional drone. At the same time, that's not the A-22 which is listed as part of a separate project and obviously points to a drone made of the A-22 Foxbat ultralight aircraft from the Ukrainian Aeroprakt company.*\n\n*One possible option is that it's based on the Skyranger Nynja, another single-engine ultralight aircraft that can be acquired as a Do-It-Yourself kit.*\n\n*Defense Express notes that one of the drones based on the Skyranger aircraft family has already been seen in use by the Ukrainian Defense Forces. In late April 2024, Russian sources published a photo depicting such a drone after it fell into the field, it was equipped with an OFAB-100-120 aerial bomb. But despite some sources having identified it as Skyranger Nynja, it actually was a very similar aircraft of the same series, the Skyranger Swift.*\n\n*Although the difference between the aircraft used as aerial vehicles for explosives is minimal, we must take note that the Swift-based drone was, most likely, a reusable bomber drone, similar to the U-2 actively used during World War II. Meanwhile, the drone that attacked Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat did not carry any bombs under its belly, as evidenced by the footage filmed by the locals. Apparently, the Ninja was from the get-go supposed to make a single-in-a-lifetime flight and thus carried explosives inside the hull.*\n\n*Still, a possibility that the Skyranger Nynja and our Ninja may still be different drones, cannot be ruled out just yet. After all, the declared operational range of Nynja is less than 700 km. Effectively multiplying the flight range would require an impressive amount of work on the part of Ukrainian engineers.*",

I think it's more likely that the weak responses simply delayed the conflict, maybe you can argue that delay gave Russia more time and resources to strike out---but I don't think it holds water. Russia's relative strength in regards to Ukraine was going DOWN as time passed on(2014-2022), as Merkel said in her now infamous interview she knew that Ukraine needed time so that was part of the reason Minsk accords were pursued. The pro-Rus people will say this is an indication that West/Germany wanted war(false, since if that were the case we wouldn't continue economic entanglement especially with greater gas infrastructure investments), some people will say it's simply Merkel trying to whitewash her hands(again false). \n\nTo go back to the earlier point, Russia's relative military strength in regards to Ukraine's was high at all points post the dissolution of the USSR. Of course what also 'stopped' Russia in its potentially imperialistic tracks was that they had a lot of economic and political issues in the early 90s, but their foreign policy stance was EXACTLY THE SAME as it is in the year 2022 in regards to Ukraine as the invasion enfolded. People like Karaganov were held high in regard at the time, and Primakov who was in an actual position of power formulated the geopolitical strategy that Russia begun to implement in around 2007. You know about Dugin's famous book? He didn't come to the ideas he presented of his own accord, he copied the official line. But alright, that foreign policy stance dies out over time as you move towards the late 90s; and Russia \"softens\" quite a bit under Kozyrev. Russia decides to go back to its prior foreign policy in probably 2004 already when the Orange revolution occurs, but in terms of actions taken definitely in around 2007/08 when they start investing heavily into the military. This is also now long after they have dealt with political and economic woes, Putin has been in power for ~8years and he's cleared a lot of house, economy is doing well, IMF debts have been paid off, and so on. It's at this point that Russia is starting to increase its relative strength to Ukraine substantially, Ukraine is not going to have a meaningful capacity to fight Russia for years---so why doesn't Russia invade back then already? After their easy incursion into Georgia in 2008, their adventures in Syria, their capture of Crimea, they're in a major position of strength. By your reckoning this should be the prime time to take over Ukraine, I assume; but they don't. If you look up most academic papers on arming Ukraine in 2013/2014, you'll see that majority of the mainstream foreign policy think tank thought in terms of a arming an insurgency movement in Ukraine. Nobody seriously thought Ukraine could stop Russia back then if they were invaded.\n\n>Equating soft power with military annexation through war is flat out an absurd take. The two are fundamentally different. \n\nThey aren't from the perspective of Russian or Chinese regimes. You can win wars through military conquest and then lose the peace, a very common occurrence in history. You can also lose wars and win the peace, much rarer but happens sometimes as well. Ultimately, the centers of power of which USA, Russia(USSR) and China are the most important hold that soft power is as important as hard power if not even more. You can track this through the doctrines that were held and promoted during the cold war, but ALSO after the cold war. China has held the concept of \"peaceful evolution theory\" to be as dangerous to its interests as any military intervention, same thing for Russia except they frame it in different terms.\n\n>One is interests aligning. The other is war.\n\nAs I said, when you can't compete by measures of soft power you choose hard power. Obviously, that only goes for areas where self-interest is considered to be paramount. The ideology that is involved doesn't really matter, just because we give credence to liberal democracy doesn't mean other states will. By the same measure you can look at communism and how it formulated its notion of expansion, it was all about \"anti-imperialism\"; about \"freeing the slave from the master\", \"workers uniting against capital\", and so on. So even though the rhetoric was about \"freeing\" others and so on, it was really about taking control and expanding one's own influence. Why do you think liberal democracy is any different? \n\n>Bush's Chicken Kiev speech was an attempt at exactly the same kind of appeasement this whole thread is about.\n\nNo, it was about the very real possibility of the USSR dissolution devolving into ethnic strife that would produce regional war akin to Yugoslavia's. Nothing to do with appeasement, who was USA appeasing? \n\n>Because as you put it, \"the geopolitical fundamentals all but demand it.\"\n\nUkraine's struggle for independence goes back a long time, but in the 90s that nationalist sentiment really had no legs.

It\u2019s a dozen SPGs destroyed this week without firing a shot because they\u2019re attempting hip shoots/and/or shooting from roads (like an MLRS would) instead of doing survivability moves in a prepared PAA.\n\nMy understanding of this statement is they're trying to drive and shoot like HIMARS can (and gets away with because of the extended range) where they should be firing from a designated artillery zone that is filled with hide sites and shooting positions. There may be a big lack of prepared and pre-stocked artillery positions in the Kharkiv area if it's like the other defensive positions that have been complained about so far.\n\nhttps://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN21932-FM_3-09-000-WEB-1.pdf\n\nOn the topic of the practicality of 'shoot and scoot', and it's use in real doctrine and combat:\n\nI think the issue is more the length of movements. He keeps degrading 'shoot and scoot' as something that's not doctrine, is stupid and was never/should never be done etc., but it IS done, and DOES work. It all depends on the types of threat and the sort of movements you are making when you 'scoot'. I think the long road movements are vulnerable to UAS, but shooting and then moving into a new hide in ~5 minutes should be possible before observation reaches you. Here's an article from an JRTC OPFOR commander who says they had to adopt displacement after every engagement because of the counterfire radar threat:\n\nhttps://www.fieldartillery.org/news/opfor-perspective\n\n> Some of these tactics include displacement after each firing mission, strict target selection standards/unmasking criteria, PAA management to prevent occupation patterns, and dispersion of the batteries into individual sections. OPFOR Fires also placed substantial emphasis on TTPs that reduced the signatures of the battery through the use of hide sites when not firing, created numerous decoys, incorporated cache sites for ammunition, had trucks turn off their engines when not in use, and reduced radio and cell phone signatures to an absolute minimum. The intent was for no one to detect our signature until we fired the IDF, and then immediately displace.\n\nHere's more articles talking about the value of and desire for quick displacement and using the term 'scoot-and-shoot'\n\nhttps://www.fieldartillery.org/news/wheely-good\n\nhttps://www.fieldartillery.org/news/the-need-for-a-wheeled-howitzer\n\nAnd here's something from Rob Lee: \nhttps://x.com/RALee85/status/1773044320288776669\n\n> Haven't talked to any 105mm batteries, but the main counterbattery threat for Ukrainian artillery is from Lancets. And the best means of defending against Lancets is to build semi-permanent shelters. So many self-propelled howitzers don't actually move that often\n\nSo the hunkering tactics working in Ukraine work because the most common cbatt tool, the Lancet, can be defeated with simple shelters. But if Russia is able to task Krasnapol, guided bombs etc. to cbatt no amount of expedient shelter could protect you- thus, you MUST be able to move to avoid being engaged at all. \n\nI reckon another factor could be that cbatt radars are not able to totally accurately determine firing locations, and thus require UAS reconnaissance to actually get something accurate enough to engage with precision weapons. Russian drones tasked with this ISR may not have the optics good enough to detect hides, even if they are exactly where fires were traced from by radar.\n\nAnd from my understanding, wheeled SPGs like CAESAR have been 'shooting and scooting' heavily and doing well at survivability.",

But if Russia is able to task Krasnapol, guided bombs etc. to cbatt no amount of expedient shelter could protect you- thus, you MUST be able to move to avoid being engaged at all. </p>\n\n<p>I reckon another factor could be that cbatt radars are not able to totally accurately determine firing locations, and thus require UAS reconnaissance to actually get something accurate enough to engage with precision weapons. Russian drones tasked with this ISR may not have the optics good enough to detect hides, even if they are exactly where fires were traced from by radar.</p>\n\n<p>And from my understanding, wheeled SPGs like CAESAR have been &#39;shooting and scooting&#39; heavily and doing well at survivability.</p>\n</div>",

I can&#39;t recall seeing video of a single Russian armored advance which wasn&#39;t being met by drone attacks or, if EW is particularly heavy, artillery fire. Not sure how you make a rapid armored advance in the face of that, plus minefields, etc.</p>\n</div>",
