                "body": "I think it\u2019s that their propaganda system is much more sophisticated than many realize. \n\nModern Russian state media is nothing like old school USSR propaganda. They don\u2019t just suppress negative news and make like every thing is working perfectly. Instead they work through and intricate system of polling, information saturation, and narrative control. Depending on real time metrics in the information space, they have multiple strategies and tactics to react-to and steer public opinion. \n\nJust one example of this is information saturation. When some compromising information comes out, they don\u2019t just suppress it and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. Instead they saturate the information space with conflicting and extreme information which in-turn makes it difficult for their target population to work out what\u2019s true, how true is it, and how important this truth (if it\u2019s true) is. \n\nI\u2019m oversimplifying here because I don\u2019t feel like writing a whole essay. But I think it\u2019s more accurate to describe Russian state media as a ball of dough, instead of an iron wall. It\u2019s constantly being kneaded and added too. Some of this kneading could very well be criticism towards the government or military, but that\u2019s just one knead as part of a larger shaping of the dough.\n\n[here\u2019s a video from a Russian political philosopher who explains this far better.](https://youtu.be/_j6Vg7yLx54)",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think it\u2019s that their propaganda system is much more sophisticated than many realize. </p>\n\n<p>Modern Russian state media is nothing like old school USSR propaganda. They don\u2019t just suppress negative news and make like every thing is working perfectly. Instead they work through and intricate system of polling, information saturation, and narrative control. Depending on real time metrics in the information space, they have multiple strategies and tactics to react-to and steer public opinion. </p>\n\n<p>Just one example of this is information saturation. When some compromising information comes out, they don\u2019t just suppress it and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. Instead they saturate the information space with conflicting and extreme information which in-turn makes it difficult for their target population to work out what\u2019s true, how true is it, and how important this truth (if it\u2019s true) is. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m oversimplifying here because I don\u2019t feel like writing a whole essay.

The operator could have some ability to modify the drone's flight pattern with a brief transmission, making it more difficult to triangulate. This would include hold position/resume/return-to-base instructions, so the operator can pause the flight if they find a target of interest.\n\nThis also mitigates electronic attack against the drone - if it's not receiving signals, then it's not an effective target for EA. The operator is, but if the operator doesn't transmit, as the defender you have to rely on your own ISR to deduce where they are. This potentially gives the operator an advantage in the electronic battlespace, because they know where their drones are, but as the defender you don't know where the operator is, so the operator can use directional receivers to preferentially amplify the signal from the drone and attenuate poorly targeted jamming. (In this scenario it's relatively difficult for an EW system to achieve an effective jam-to-signal ratio, because signal strength at the base station is likely roughly proportional to the distance to the drone, while jam strength is proportional to the distance to the jammer squared or even *cubed*, depending on the characteristics of the equipment involved.)\n\nAnother way to mitigate the risk is to position the transmitter far away from any other assets.

Israel flew F-35s deep into Iran, which would have given Iranian SAM operators the chance to observe the radar returns of F-35s without Luneburg lens. If one of those F-35s had been shot down or experienced a technical problem and crashed, then China would have an F-35 in their possession.\n\nI think that F-35s in Ukrainian hands would be safer than those in Israeli hands, especially if they aren't used for deep penetration operations. If an F-35 yolos deep into enemy territory, it will be at risk of being detected by a SAM that keeps its radar turned off until the F-35 is overhead, getting its approximate location detected by low-frequency radars and then surrounded by interceptors, or just having some SAM or plane located behind its position detect it from an angle where it isn't very stealthy. F-35s loitering 50-75 km behind the front line, protected by Ukraine's air defense umbrella, will be very safe, and will be able to detect and destroy low-flying Russian attack planes launching rocket volleys and attack helicopters using AMRAAMs. F-35s flying over the black sea would be able to confine the Black Sea Fleet to port (as it has no long-ranged SAMs whatsoever after the destruction of the Moskva and as the single newer frigate armed with S-350s is still undergoing trials) and as the lack of land-based radars would make it much harder to detect them, interdict Russian cargo vessels heading to Crimea, and hit the Crimea bridge repeatedly (SDB IIs can be used for anti-ship combat, as I think an F-35B can carry 6 of those in addition to 2 AMRAAMs without having anything externally, and they have a 72 km range against moving targets).\n\nAnd the chances of Russia capturing an F-35 wreck would be minimal. Even if they somehow manage to down one of them 50-75 km behind the front line, retrieving it would be very difficult. If one goes down over the Black Sea, it would fall into the water, and I severely doubt Russia has the ability to fish something out in an active warzone (indeed, the Turks could be asked to fish it out for us). As long as you don't use F-35s to try and drop JDAMs on Russian positions, it would be very hard for Russia to grab any of them.\n\nAnd I don't see how donating 24 or so F-35Bs to Ukraine would compromise the US's security to any significant extent. The US has sold F-35s (some delivered, some not) to many other countries that probably won't help it fight China, such as Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, and Finland, as well as to many European countries such as Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, etc. that don't have much expeditionary capability. If the US needed every single F-35 possible to fight China, then why sell to these countries? I doubt 24 F-35s are going to be the difference between victory and defeat, and seeing how the F-35 performs in combat would be very valuable. Besides, helping Ukraine win would allow the US to gain access to large amounts of noble gases (important for chip production), natural gas (especially important if Russia refuses to sell gas and stops Azerbaijan from doing it as well during a war with China), and cropland, all of which would be useful both in a war against China and in strengthening our position in the world.\n\nHow are the Ukrainians not the second most powerful country in Europe? They had in excess of 2000 tanks even before this war, enormous amounts of artillery, lots of APCs and IFVs, tons and tons of soldiers, as well as significant conventional combat experience (both from the current war, and the war in the Donbass, which lasted for years). Most western European countries had ~200 or less tanks, very little artillery, few soldiers, and no conventional combat experience. Some had 5th generation fighters, which are great, but don't compensate for a lack of everything else. If you compare Ukraine to France, you can clearly see that Ukraine is stronger in nearly every way. \n\nHow would Russia destroy F-35Bs that move frequently and can take off from whereever? Sure, as I said previously, they would be at risk if used to penetrate Russian lines, where SAM density is high and enemy fighters can swarm them from all sides, but F-35s used behind Ukrainian lines or over the Black Sea seem like they would be very hard to detect and destroy. And even if some are destroyed, it would be very hard for Russia to grab them.\n\nAnd 4th generation aircraft aren't that great. They would probably just be used for firing rockets like a flying MLRS, or shooting down cruise missiles, or something like that. The west lacks ultra-long ranged air-to-air missiles, and thus stealth is needed to contest the Russian air force in the air. F-35Bs would be able to keep Su-25s and helicopters off the backs of Ukrainian soldiers, and would thus be of great benefit. They would also help besiege Crimea.",

When that happens, without Western jets, Ukraine cedes its entire high-altitude air space to the Russians. The country quickly loses the ability to deter large-scale dumb bombing deep into its territory. You can solve this in the interim with Western SAMs, but we have a different doctrine that considers them less important. We have fewer to go around.\n\nThe doctrine difference is that NATO denies air power from the air. Two squadrons of F-16s are enough to counter any deep penetration by the Russians even if they have to be positioned deep behind the lines and occasionally attrited when strong patriot coverage still lets one through.

When that happens, without Western jets, Ukraine cedes its entire high-altitude air space to the Russians. The country quickly loses the ability to deter large-scale dumb bombing deep into its territory. You can solve this in the interim with Western SAMs, but we have a different doctrine that considers them less important. We have fewer to go around.</p>\n\n<p>The doctrine difference is that NATO denies air power from the air. Two squadrons of F-16s are enough to counter any deep penetration by the Russians even if they have to be positioned deep behind the lines and occasionally attrited when strong patriot coverage still lets one through. Basically, it\u2019s aligning Ukraine with how NATO would be fighting a war where it hadn\u2019t established air superiority.</p>\n</div>",

Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Monday to continue the U.S.-Israel talks about Iran and other regional issues.\n\n>Last week, the U.S. and Israel carried out their largest-ever joint military exercise involving more than 7,500 personnel from both countries and a series of scenarios to test their ability to take out air-defense systems and refuel jet planes -- both of which could be key elements of a major military strike on Iran.\n\n>Israel's top general told The Wall Street Journal last week that Israel and the U.S. were preparing for the worst.\n\n>Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israel Defense Forces' chief of staff, said that the military exercises sent \"a very clear message to Iran: If Iran makes mistakes, offense capabilities are getting ready.\"\n\n>Efforts by President Biden to resurrect a nuclear containment deal with Iran have come to a standstill, but the U.S. has yet to develop an alternative. Mr. Netanyahu has been pushing the U.S. to take a tougher stance against Iran.\n\n>At the same time, the U.S. has been pressing Israel to do more to help Ukraine in its war with Russia, especially now that Tehran is providing Moscow with hundreds of drones used to attack Ukraine. Israel has rebuffed pressure to send Ukraine direct military aid, which Russian politicians have warned would imperil Israeli relations with Moscow.\n\n>Russia and Israel have had a yearslong understanding that has allowed Israeli warplanes to repeatedly strike Iranian targets inside Syria, where Moscow provides air defenses for President Bashar al-Assad. Israel is worried that open support for Ukraine could imperil its ability to strike Iranian targets in Syria.\n\n>Mr. Netanyahu's new government isn't expected to offer Ukraine direct military support. But it is expected to continue carrying out covert strikes against Iran's nuclear and military program.\n\n>Strikes like the one over the weekend help damage Iran's ability to help Russia with the war in Ukraine.\n\n>\"This is a smart trifecta where Israel can hurt Iran, help Ukraine, and not risk its strategic interests in Syria or run the risk of the diversion of its sensitive military technology to Russia and into Iran,\" said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive officer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank critical of Iran.\n\n>\"Explosive night in Iran,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, wrote on Twitter in response to the blast in Iran. \"[Ukraine] did warn you.\"\n\n>When Mr. Netanyahu was last in office, he oversaw a series of Israeli strikes on Iran involving small drones like those used over the weekend, according to former Israeli and U.S. officials. His successor, Naftali Bennett, embraced a strategy he called the \"Octopus Doctrine,\" under which Israel carried out strikes not just against Tehran's proxies in the Middle East, like Hezbollah, but also against Iran itself as the head of the so-called octopus.\n\n>In 2021, Iran's Atomic Energy Agency said it had thwarted an attack by two quadcopter drones on one of its facilities. Last May, quadcopters were used to target a military site used to develop drone, missile and nuclear technology outside Tehran.\n\n>The main target of Saturday's strike was a warehouse located behind a mall in Isfahan that Iran said was an ammunition storehouse. Video of the explosion posted on social media by witnesses captured a small explosion above a building that appeared to cause minimal damage.\n\n>Satellite imagery released on Sunday appeared to show minor damage to the building.\n\n>Ronen Solomon, an independent intelligence analyst and author of the Intelli Times blog, said that the small size of the blast indicated that the target wasn't an ammunition storehouse. Instead, he said, it could have been a lab or military-logistics site.\n\n>Public figures in Iran suggested Israel and its Western allies were behind the attack.\n\n>\"They both need to learn that punishment comes with failure too,\" said Mohammad Marandi, who is close to the government and was previously a spokesman for Iran's nuclear-negotiations team.\n\n>Mr. Solomon said satellite imagery showed the warehouse is located across the street from a site belonging to a unit of the Iran Space Research Center, a U.S.-sanctioned organization that has worked with the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, which is responsible for Iran's ballistic missile programs, and the Iranian Ministry of Defense.\n\n>The Wall Street Journal was able to confirm Mr. Solomon's information. Social-media channels close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps separately showed a satellite image of the targeted site, which matches the exact area where the Isfahan unit of the Space Research Center is located.\n\n>A missile plant owned by the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group on a site west of Tehran was reportedly targeted by an Israeli strike in September 2021.",

How is that imperialism?\n\nAlso, official government is what the US says it is, isn't it? Like Guiado in Venezuela. Or they are not governments, they are \"regimes\"... Be serious here, people are trying to have factual and reasoned dialogues and debates.\n\nNever mind the constitutional pledge of Ukraine to become part of NATO and a spear against Russia.\n\nUkraine defines its nationalism not only as Not Russians, but ANTI Russian.

                            "body": "Ty, I appreciate the Sobyanin/Roizman/Furgal/etc. info. **If you have places to look at to back up the Navalny 35-40% claim, please share**, because (I'm not in a position to speak confidently) AFAIK, it isn't realistic. Unfortunately, I don't think hypotheticals can be \"proven\" either way. And poll validity can be questioned.\n\nAnd to anyone reading this, to be clear, I'd like to see all Russians forcibly removed from pre 2014 borders, at the cost of as few Ukrainian men as possible. But I'm not interested in avoiding what I think is true.\n\nI am certain that I haven't seen any polls with <50% (and probably 60%) domestic support for Putin. I am nearly certain that approval ratings increased post-Feb 24.\n\nI don't think my position can really be defended. It's who you want to believe. The tweet I have saved is from October, \"Putin Approval Dips For First Time After Ukraine Invasion\"\nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/28383/putin-approval/\n\nI know you can call bullshit on that. I am certain I watched a video interviewing Russians, in Russia. (Man-on-the-street), shortly post-invasion. They were not upset (some resigned to reality that the status quo will continue on, regardless). I know, you can call that bullshit as well. (It was probably EoM or TVRainn before the take down)\n\nI looked at the Navalny wikipedia article. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny ctrl f %. I don't see him as being a contender, based on what's there.\n\nI did the same for Nemtsov https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov . Again, the uninformed understanding I had was that (the Russian populace considered) Nemtsov was the opportunity for the country to move in a different direction. I'm sorry, I don't have that citation noted. It was probably around the anniversary of his death. So maybe it was too kind to him.\n\nI don't think the war's popularity is the relevant issue. I think the popularity of candidate #1 and #2 for head-of-state is.\n\nTo all the idiots reading this, if you are wondering whether Navalny is in any realistic position to be elected President, I think the bottom line is unfortunately no (and, he's not some perfect man, either).\n\nI don't mean to sound aggressive. There's been dreams of \"oh everything in Russia will fall to shit, surely, and the government will be overthrown!\" from day 1. I think that has been demonstrated false.\n\nAnd I know, there have been limited protests in Russia. And I understand the challenges/explanation as to why there have been so few. And I watched the mass-exodus of males cross borders. FWIW, if you read the comments on a site like vc.ru, there is like 1-5% pro-Putin or pro-war, and those get called shills. The rest are unrelated, or criticize Putin (or, typical internet cynicism, resigned to life under the bunker dwarf). Typical \"what can we do but suffer\", similar to western politics.\n\nThere have also been pro-Russian protests, in foreign countries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack to OP:\n\nI guess their target audience would be western countries? (with the Berlin demonstration).\nMy perception, as an idiot, is that there are only 2 names known in Russian politics: Putin, and Navalny (and Navalny has no fucking chance). I assume most laymen only know the same 2 names. I guess Navalny's party would want to try and bolster support/foreign funding(?) (I'm not even sure if foreign funding is allowed). Or try to push the perception that there is popular resistance against Putin (AFAIK that is false. You can believe what you want).\nI guess their goal would be to sow division in the Russian populace (judging by their youtube channel).\nOr, to give the impression that there is realistic/possible opposition to Putin. (maybe that makes foreigners more willing to support Ukraine financially. Or, at least think less of Russia's strength. Maybe if someone said, \"*do you want to support Ukraine? Putin has a high approval rating, and the Russian populace is pretty united*.\" the answer would be \"no\".\nIt seems like they're the kind of political group who tries to tear the country apart from the inside by pointing out how bad everything is. I'm sure they have their own ideas regarding moving in a positive direction, but their youtube is pretty.. idk if \"alarmist\" is the right term, but it is certainly negative-focused/outrage. (you can certainly say that they're trying to put a spotlight on corruption/nepotism/etc)\n\n- Navalny's yt seems like it's mostly criticizing Putin, and trying to get people opposed to super-rich spending.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@NavalnyRu/videos\n\n- Again, seems to be mostly activism/divisiveness you'd expect with a political party:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxTPTFbIbCWfTR9I2-5SeQ/videos\n\nI used to follow Navalny's twitter (until after his imprisonment). I don't recall having a high impression of it. It seemed like futility, and I don't recall learning any revelations from it. It seemed kind of empty/hollow. A lot of it concerned his trial though, so typically \"boring\" court stuff.\nhttps://twitter.com/navalny\n\nThe likes seem low on his twitter. Idk anything about social media. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a Russian thing (like, his telegram is more active).\nThe youtube channels seem to have believable/high views and comments to go along with the subscriber numbers. I can't read Russian to see what the comments (with grammar) look like. Remember the populaton of the country is @150m\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Again, I am not the person with their finger-on-the-pulse of Russian politics**. I've never followed Russian politics prior to 2022 (outside of hearing \"Navalny\", \"Nemtsov murdered\", etc.) so don't put faith into what I say. I have however watched a lot of wide-eyed people, including myself, fall for \"Russia will collapse/change\" promises in the last 11 months, and I think the chance of that happening is very low.\n\nBut hey, there was the office paper shortage.",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ty, I appreciate the Sobyanin/Roizman/Furgal/etc. info. <strong>If you have places to look at to back up the Navalny 35-40% claim, please share</strong>, because (I&#39;m not in a position to speak confidently) AFAIK, it isn&#39;t realistic. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think hypotheticals can be &quot;proven&quot; either way. And poll validity can be questioned.</p>\n\n<p>And to anyone reading this, to be clear, I&#39;d like to see all Russians forcibly removed from pre 2014 borders, at the cost of as few Ukrainian men as possible. But I&#39;m not interested in avoiding what I think is true.</p>\n\n<p>I am certain that I haven&#39;t seen any polls with &lt;50% (and probably 60%) domestic support for Putin. I am nearly certain that approval ratings increased post-Feb 24.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think my position can really be defended. It&#39;s who you want to believe. The tweet I have saved is from October, &quot;Putin Approval Dips For First Time After Ukraine Invasion&quot;\n<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/28383/putin-approval/\">https://www.statista.com/chart/28383/putin-approval/</a></p>\n\n<p>I know you can call bullshit on that. I am certain I watched a video interviewing Russians, in Russia. (Man-on-the-street), shortly post-invasion. They were not upset (some resigned to reality that the status quo will continue on, regardless). I know, you can call that bullshit as well. (It was probably EoM or TVRainn before the take down)</p>\n\n<p>I looked at the Navalny wikipedia article. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny</a> ctrl f %. I don&#39;t see him as being a contender, based on what&#39;s there.</p>\n\n<p>I did the same for Nemtsov <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov</a> . Again, the uninformed understanding I had was that (the Russian populace considered) Nemtsov was the opportunity for the country to move in a different direction. I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t have that citation noted. It was probably around the anniversary of his death. So maybe it was too kind to him.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think the war&#39;s popularity is the relevant issue. I think the popularity of candidate #1 and #2 for head-of-state is.</p>\n\n<p>To all the idiots reading this, if you are wondering whether Navalny is in any realistic position to be elected President, I think the bottom line is unfortunately no (and, he&#39;s not some perfect man, either).</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t mean to sound aggressive. There&#39;s been dreams of &quot;oh everything in Russia will fall to shit, surely, and the government will be overthrown!&quot; from day 1. I think that has been demonstrated false.</p>\n\n<p>And I know, there have been limited protests in Russia. And I understand the challenges/explanation as to why there have been so few. And I watched the mass-exodus of males cross borders. FWIW, if you read the comments on a site like vc.ru, there is like 1-5% pro-Putin or pro-war, and those get called shills.
