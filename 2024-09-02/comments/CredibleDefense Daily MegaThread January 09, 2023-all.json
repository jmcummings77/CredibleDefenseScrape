The enemy has reached a position from which he can fire on the main supply route to Soledar.  The Russians can't get on the right path. This is not a complete encirclement, but normal supply along the route is impossible, this is critical for defense. But there are opportunities to correct the situation.\n\n>We have considerable forces concentrated in this area, there are troops, there are many people. There is equipment. The difficult situation is clear to everyone. Actions are needed that will correct this situation. What is needed are not chaotic actions, but planned ones, to realize our advantages step by step. The tactical situation is clear to our command, O. Syrskyi, the commander of the OUV, was in Soledar yesterday.\n\n>What is happening in Soledar itself? The temperature complicates the actions of the troops: - 18, this must be taken into account, and it creates problems for both us and the enemy. At this temperature, combat capability is highly dependent on adequate supplies.\n\n>The 46th Airborne Brigade is fighting tough defensive battles for every house. They are also helped by some other units - border guards, SSO, tankers. Melee battles and skirmishes continue. Today, the Russians advanced in some directions, but at the cost of very heavy losses.\n\n>The 46th aeromobile brigade is doing its best, maintaining combat capability in extremely difficult conditions. The paratroopers act exemplary, the fighters trust the commanders, and everyone does everything possible to destroy the enemy. The Russian assault groups are destroyed one by one in close-range contact battles, but they continue to attack and bring reserves into battle.\n\n>But the main threat from the Russians is to cover the city from the flanks. They will do everything possible to make their way to the track behind Soledar. To bypass Soledar, fresh reserves from the airborne troops were sent, the Russian command attaches great political importance to the capture of Soledar.\n\n>It is mentioned how one 93rd mechanized brigade with the support of TRO battalions held the front from Soledar to Bakhmut for three months in a row in the summer. How important it would be if the brigade commander and all battalion commanders of the 93rd battalion were recognized for their skillful actions at the highest level, and they tried to organize management, intelligence, and the use of troops as effectively as the 93rd operated. They fought for every landing and inflicted losses on the Russians many times greater than they suffered themselves. If you manage in this way, then there is every possibility to correct the situation.\n\n>Units of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade and the 46th Airmobile Brigade are also operating nearby as effectively. Our army has the commanders and experience to effectively destroy the Russians and win in the most difficult conditions.\n\n>We all worry about the heroes of Soledar, and we believe in our army, which, with proper organization, can defeat the Russian invaders near Soledar.",

            "body": "> **Conditions for Success**    \n>Analysis of the 24 game iterations showed four necessary conditions to defeat a Chinese invasion.   \n \n>1. Taiwanese forces must hold the line.    \n>Recommendation: Strengthen Taiwanese ground forces. Because some Chinese forces will always\nland on the island, Taiwanese ground forces must be able to contain any beachhead and then\ncounterattack forcefully as Chinese logistics weaken. However, the Taiwanese ground forces have\nsevere weaknesses. Therefore, Taiwan must fill its ranks and conduct rigorous, combined arms training.\nGround forces must become the center of Taiwan\u2019s defense effort.   \n \n>2. There is no \u201cUkraine model\u201d for Taiwan.    \n>Recommendation: In peacetime, the United States and Taiwan must work together to provide Taiwan\nwith the weapons it needs; in wartime, if the United States decides to defend Taiwan, U.S. forces\nmust quickly engage in direct combat. In the Ukraine war, the United States and the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) have not sent troops directly into combat but have sent massive amounts of\nequipment and supplies to Ukraine. Russia has been unable to interdict this overland flow. However, the\n\u201cUkraine model\u201d cannot be replicated in Taiwan because China can isolate the island for weeks or even\nmonths. Taiwan must start the war with everything it needs. Further, delays and half measures by the\nUnited States would make the defense harder, increase U.S. casualties, allow China to create a stronger\nlodgment, and raise the risk of escalation.    \n\n>3. The United States must be able to use its bases in Japan for combat operations.    \n>Recommendation: Deepen diplomatic and military ties with Japan. While other allies (e.g., Australia\nand South Korea) are important in the broader competition with China and may play some role in the\ndefense of Taiwan, Japan is the linchpin. Without the use of U.S. bases in Japan, U.S. fighter/attack\naircraft cannot effectively participate in the war.    \n\n>4. The United States must be able to strike the Chinese fleet rapidly and en masse from outside\nthe Chinese defensive zone.    \n>Recommendation: Increase the arsenal of long-range anti-ship cruise missiles. Bombers capable\nof launching standoff, anti-ship ordnance offer the fastest way to defeat the invasion with the least\namount of U.S. losses. Procuring such missiles and upgrading existing missiles with this anti-ship\ncapability needs to be the top procurement priority.\n\n-\n\n>**Avoiding a Pyrrhic Victory**\n\n\n>Victory is not everything. The United States might win a pyrrhic victory, suffering more in the long run\nthan the \u201cdefeated\u201d Chinese. Furthermore, the perception of high costs might undermine deterrence:\nif China believes that the United States would be unwilling to bear the high costs of defending Taiwan,\nthen China might risk an invasion. The United States should therefore institute policies and programs\nto make winning less costly in the event of conflict. Such measures would include:\n\n>POLITICS AND STRATEGY    \n\u25aa Clarify war plan assumptions. There is a seeming gap between war plans, which assume prewar\ndeployments to Taiwan and neutral countries, and political realities.    \n\u25aa Do not plan on striking the mainland. The National Command Authority might withhold\npermission because of the grave risks of escalation with a nuclear power.    \n\u25aa Recognize the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties. In three weeks,\nthe United States will suffer about half as many casualties as it did in 20 years of war in Iraq\nand Afghanistan.    \n\u25aa Move Taiwanese air and naval forces toward asymmetry. Despite rhetoric about adopting a\n\u201cporcupine strategy,\u201d Taiwan still spends most of its defense budget on expensive ships and\naircraft that China will quickly destroy.\n\n>DOCTRINE AND POSTURE    \n\u25aa Fortify and expand air bases in Japan and Guam. Dispersion and hardening dilute the effects of\nmissile attacks.    \n\u25aa Revise U.S. Air Force doctrine and restructure procurement to increase aircraft survivability on\nthe ground. Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground.    \n\u25aa Do not plan on overflying the Chinese mainland. Chinese air defense is too strong, the targets\ntake a long time to produce operational results, and the air missions around Taiwan take priority.    \n\u25aa Recognize the limitations of Marine Littoral Regiments and Army Multi-Domain Task Forces\nand cap their numbers. These units are designed to counter China and do provide some value, but\npolitical and operational difficulties put limits on their utility.    \n\u25aa Avoid crisis deployments that create vulnerabilities. Military doctrine calls for forward\ndeployments to enhance deterrence during a crisis, but these forces make tempting targets.\n\n>WEAPONS AND PLATFORMS    \n\u25aa Shift to smaller, more survivable ships and develop rescue mechanisms to deal with crippled\nships and multiple sinkings. Surface ships are extremely vulnerable, with the United States\ntypically losing two carriers and 10 to 20 large surface combatants in game iterations.    \n\u25aa Prioritize submarines and other undersea platforms. Submarines were able to enter the\nChinese defensive zone and wreak havoc with the Chinese fleet, but numbers were inadequate.    \n\u25aa Continue development and fielding of hypersonic weapons but recognize that they are niche\nweapons. Their high cost limits inventories, so they lack the volume needed to counter the\nimmense numbers of Chinese air and naval platforms.    \n\u25aa Prioritize sustainment of the bomber fleet over fighters. The range, missile standoff distance, and\nhigh carrying capacity of bombers presented the People\u2019s Liberation Army with daunting challenges.    \n\u25aa Produce more, cheaper fighters and balance the acquisition of stealth aircraft with production\nof non-stealth aircraft. With so many aircraft lost early in the conflict, the Air Force risks running\nout of fighter/attack aircraft and becoming a secondary player in the conflict unless it has a large\nenough force to sustain the losses.    \n\n\n>Finally, the project and its recommendations need some caveats. Modeling an invasion does not imply\nthat it is inevitable or even probable. The Chinese leadership might adopt a strategy of diplomatic\nisolation, gray zone pressure, or economic coercion against Taiwan; even if China opts for military force,\nthis might take the form of a blockade rather than an outright invasion. However, the risk of invasion is\nreal enough and potentially so destructive that analysis is worthwhile.\n\n>The project does not take a position on whether the benefits of defending Taiwan outweigh the\nprospective costs, or how to weigh those costs and benefits. Instead, the purpose is to enhance the\npublic debate and thus allow the nation to make better-informed decisions on this critical national\nsecurity challenge.\n\n\nFull link [here](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?WdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ)",

I realized that I have been implicitly assuming that the war is determined by initial configuration the combatants found themselves in after first few months of the war.  In short, the Russian side will always be hobbled by lack of experienced soldiers and ready equipment, while Ukraine will always enjoy the advantage of professionally trained forces.\n\nHowever, this assumption really rests on presumed inability of Russians to make changes in their force generation capacity.

Russians have the capacity to keep the conflict going long enough that new/repurposed military industry complexes and training facilities can be brought online.  In the past , the incentives of corruption and rent-seeking created ascendancy of appearance of military power over the reality of it.  However, the circumstances have changed - the survival of the Putin regime is certainly dependent on victory in Ukraine, and it will do anything and everything within it's power to survive.  That doesn't mean that it's capacity to improve Russian military is unconstrained - but some limits which existed in the past have been significantly diminished.  To put it bluntly, the business owners in Russia are faced with the dilemma - support the state with their resources, or take a short but picturesque one way trip out the window.  \n\nThat, and readiness to sacrifice civilian standard of living, will liberate resources which will be directed to the military and security sector.  I think we can reasonably expect that Russia will increase it's artillery munition production, that it's air force will adjust it's tactics to be more effective, that untrained soldiers sent to the front will be replaced with reasonably well trained soldiers in the future.  To win, Ukraine will need not just match Russia, but significantly overmatch it.

The point of just about any composite material is to mix a hard-but-brittle material (in this case, ceramic) with a not-as-hard-but-malleable material (in this case, metal). The advantage of DU for armor-piercing shells is that it is both very dense and very hard, but it's not particularly malleable. In Chobham armor, the ceramic provides the desired hardness. It'd make more sense to compose it with a somewhat softer metal, like steel, to reduce the risk of the armor shattering. That said while some of my relatives are experts in materials science, I'm not, so there could be other considerations I'm unaware of.

The delivery of the first four systems won\u2019t take place until mid-2023, with 10 more arriving by the end of the year.  \n  \n>The Pentagon hasn\u2019t said why it took several months from the initial announcement to issue a contract for the counterdrone technology. The company behind the Vampire said it was just a matter of paperwork.  \n\n>\u201cIt was just a process to get to the right contract vehicle and the right mechanism in order to get us turned on,\u201d said Luke Savoie, president of the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business at L3Harris Technologies Inc.  \n \n>The contract underscores the challenging effort among the U.S. and allies to help Kyiv counter the threat posed by the large, slow and cheap Iranian Shahed-136 drone that Russia has deployed to attack Ukrainian cities and electricity infrastructure. It also highlights, however, the difficulty of deploying the systems quickly and in enough numbers to mount an effective defense.  \n  \n>\u201cI think Ukraine needs a lot of these systems distributed very widely across the entire depth of the front,\u201d said Sam Bendett, a drone expert at the Center for Naval Analyses, a federally funded research organization in Arlington, Va. \u201cIt would need hundreds of these systems around large cities, around large military facilities, around military bases, in main infrastructure facilities and the like.\u201d  \n \n>The Vampire, an acronym for Vehicle-Agnostic Modular Palletized ISR Rocket Equipment, uses high-definition sensors to track threats\u2014including drones\u2014then intercepts them with laser-guided munitions. The system is designed to fit in the bed of a commercial pickup, according to L3Harris.  \n \n>While Ukrainian forces have had some success shooting down suicide drones or loitering munitions, but no system so far provides comprehensive defense. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky singled out the drones in his December speech to Congress, saying, \u201cIranian deadly drones, sent to Russia in hundreds, became a threat to our critical infrastructure.\u201d  \n  \n>Russia began deploying Iran\u2019s Shahed-136 en masse in September 2022.  At first, Russia aimed the drones at military positions, before it began to target power plants and civilian buildings.  \n  \n>Ukrainian troops have shot down the majority of the drones fired by Russia using a mix of surface-to-air missiles, air-to-air missiles, antiaircraft guns and man-portable air defense systems known as manpads, according to Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London.  \n \n>In early January, Ukrainian officials said they shot down drones using NASAMS, a U.S.-provided surface-to-air missile defense system. However, air defense remains a patchwork.  \n  \n>The Shahed, which is made from mostly commercial parts, including from the West, is so noisy it earned the nickname \u201cthe flying moped,\u201d said Mr. Bendett, the drone expert. It can be preprogrammed with GPS coordinates to hit a target without communicating with an operator.  \n\n>Shahed lowered the threshold to developing and constructing a fairly effective, very cheap and expendable loitering munition,\u201d Mr. Bendett said. \u201cIf the cost of attack is going to be less than the cost of defense, then the strain is going to be on the defender.\u201d  \n\n>At a counter drone conference last month, Richard Ast, director of unmanned systems technology in the Pentagon\u2019s research and engineering directorate, said his office was looking at industry to help come up with solutions. In particular, he pointed to the threat of autonomous drones fired in large numbers. \u201cThe key word is degrade,\u201d Mr. Ast said. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to be able to defeat them wholeheartedly.\u201d  \n  \n>U.S. and NATO officials declined to provide details on what other types of counterdrone systems it is seeking to provide to Ukraine.  \n \n>Scott Crino, a former military attack helicopter pilot and founder of consulting firm Red Six Solutions LLC, said several counterdrone technologies are in development. Some systems, such as the Vampire, strike the drone itself; others would detonate near a drone and \u201cexplode out like a shotgun blast,\u201d he said.  \n  \n>The U.S. has focused on lasers and high-powered microwaves to target smaller, hobbyist drones rigged with explosives, but neither technology has matured enough to be deployed against the Shahed-136, Mr. Crino said.  \n \n>The most promising solution is electronic warfare, which jams radio signals to the aircraft or its satellite-navigation systems. However, Mr. Crino said the Shaheds had been dodging that tactic using an anti-jamming antenna.  \n \n>\u201cI think we have made a lot of strides in creating capabilities that are effective against the Shaheds,\u201d Mr. Crino said. \u201cOur ability to get those systems to Ukraine and get them integrated into their defensive structure has been somewhat more limited.\u201d  \n \n>As the Russian invasion nears its first anniversary, private companies say they are factoring the Iranian drones into their planning.  \n \n>Bill Haraka, vice president of defense and security with the Dutch Robin Radar Systems, said his firm was optimizing its sensors to best identify larger drones including the Shahed-136.  \u201cThe requests we\u2019re getting from different organizations in Europe is actually to battle that particular threat,\u201d Haraka said.  \n \n>Fortem Technologies, a Utah-based airspace security company, said it was modifying its DroneHunter system, which captures drones in nets, to work against Iranian drones. \u201cWe have certainly been made aware of the characteristics of the Shahed-136, and we have made improvements that can capture that type of drone,\u201d CEO Jon Gruen said.  \n \n>He added that the Shahed-136 \u201cis currently the biggest threat of an unmanned air system type in the Ukrainian conflict.\u201d\n\nI can't think of another weapon system in recent history that forced the military-industry of such wide variety of nations (including Israel, the Gulf and the entire West) to quickly scramble to come up with a cost-effective solution against it. Remarkable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Bill Haraka, vice president of defense and security with the Dutch Robin Radar Systems, said his firm was optimizing its sensors to best identify larger drones including the Shahed-136. \u201cThe requests we\u2019re getting from different organizations in Europe is actually to battle that particular threat,\u201d Haraka said.\n\nIn other words, still difficulty with detection.",

At first, Russia aimed the drones at military positions, before it began to target power plants and civilian buildings.  </p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian troops have shot down the majority of the drones fired by Russia using a mix of surface-to-air missiles, air-to-air missiles, antiaircraft guns and man-portable air defense systems known as manpads, according to Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London.  </p>\n\n<p>In early January, Ukrainian officials said they shot down drones using NASAMS, a U.S.-provided surface-to-air missile defense system. However, air defense remains a patchwork.  </p>\n\n<p>The Shahed, which is made from mostly commercial parts, including from the West, is so noisy it earned the nickname \u201cthe flying moped,\u201d said Mr. Bendett, the drone expert. It can be preprogrammed with GPS coordinates to hit a target without communicating with an operator.  </p>\n\n<p>Shahed lowered the threshold to developing and constructing a fairly effective, very cheap and expendable loitering munition,\u201d Mr. Bendett said. \u201cIf the cost of attack is going to be less than the cost of defense, then the strain is going to be on the defender.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>At a counter drone conference last month, Richard Ast, director of unmanned systems technology in the Pentagon\u2019s research and engineering directorate, said his office was looking at industry to help come up with solutions. In particular, he pointed to the threat of autonomous drones fired in large numbers. \u201cThe key word is degrade,\u201d Mr. Ast said. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to be able to defeat them wholeheartedly.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>U.S. and NATO officials declined to provide details on what other types of counterdrone systems it is seeking to provide to Ukraine.  </p>\n\n<p>Scott Crino, a former military attack helicopter pilot and founder of consulting firm Red Six Solutions LLC, said several counterdrone technologies are in development. Some systems, such as the Vampire, strike the drone itself; others would detonate near a drone and \u201cexplode out like a shotgun blast,\u201d he said.  </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has focused on lasers and high-powered microwaves to target smaller, hobbyist drones rigged with explosives, but neither technology has matured enough to be deployed against the Shahed-136, Mr. Crino said.  </p>\n\n<p>The most promising solution is electronic warfare, which jams radio signals to the aircraft or its satellite-navigation systems. However, Mr. Crino said the Shaheds had been dodging that tactic using an anti-jamming antenna.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think we have made a lot of strides in creating capabilities that are effective against the Shaheds,\u201d Mr. Crino said. \u201cOur ability to get those systems to Ukraine and get them integrated into their defensive structure has been somewhat more limited.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>As the Russian invasion nears its first anniversary, private companies say they are factoring the Iranian drones into their planning.  </p>\n\n<p>Bill Haraka, vice president of defense and security with the Dutch Robin Radar Systems, said his firm was optimizing its sensors to best identify larger drones including the Shahed-136.  \u201cThe requests we\u2019re getting from different organizations in Europe is actually to battle that particular threat,\u201d Haraka said.  </p>\n\n<p>Fortem Technologies, a Utah-based airspace security company, said it was modifying its DroneHunter system, which captures drones in nets, to work against Iranian drones. \u201cWe have certainly been made aware of the characteristics of the Shahed-136, and we have made improvements that can capture that type of drone,\u201d CEO Jon Gruen said.  </p>\n\n<p>He added that the Shahed-136 \u201cis currently the biggest threat of an unmanned air system type in the Ukrainian conflict.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t think of another weapon system in recent history that forced the military-industry of such wide variety of nations (including Israel, the Gulf and the entire West) to quickly scramble to come up with a cost-effective solution against it. Remarkable.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bill Haraka, vice president of defense and security with the Dutch Robin Radar Systems, said his firm was optimizing its sensors to best identify larger drones including the Shahed-136. \u201cThe requests we\u2019re getting from different organizations in Europe is actually to battle that particular threat,\u201d Haraka said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, still difficulty with detection.</p>\n</div>",

Attrition replacements and supplies, in order to maintain the current capacity of the Ukrainian forces.  A monthly sustained feed of supplies. With surges as needed. \n\nThere is a lot of talk about giving more weapons, tanks, guns,  space lasers to Ukraine. However dribing, and drabbing it in, without a plan to employ it is foolhardy at best, and allows for a dilution of effort on the ground. 10 Challengers here, 50 Bradleys there......\n\nIn exchange taking up a longer term view, via Ring Swaps, or NATO increases in production of building up a New Ukrainian army / Police Force / Intelligence service that is more plugged in with the west. Complete with Western Officers (How the Foreign legion should have happened) if needed.\n\nI really feel that the haphazard nature of aid and supply needs to slowly come to an end, and a new phase of building up Ukraine needs to begin. Ideally bilateral grants and loans (To keep them away from the IMF and World Bank for a while) and for some countries immigration assistance are a  good option, the Blackwater deal is excellent and something the west need to start pushing.\n\nTo loop away from sustaining and building new governance structures, I think that the real strategy for future assistance and Military needs to be as follows:  \n\n\n1. **Sustained Ring Swaps for Equipment in Europe** \\- Replacing the EU's supply of former Soviet equipment, either through grants, or Aid. From Small arms, to Howitzers and Jets, this will free up additional attritional replacement and some modest expansion to Ukraine to use up the equipment.  I think back to the programs done in the 1950s-1960s. Even if the first round of replacements are M113s for BMPs......before moving to a 'New NATO replacement program' to standardize equipment.  This also allows for a long term view of production lines over the mid-term.\n2. **Taking over the training system** \\- NATO and the EU can, with mobilization of some selected reserves begin to take over the entire training system for the Ukrainian armed and police forces. Everything from Initial training, to staff college, from Environmental Management to General safety.  \n3. **Equipment donations to equip a new force.** It does look as if the situation is stable enough. With current reserves of equipment, it should not be hard to equip several Brigades ground to top, rather than feeding in dribs and drabs. More importantly than new combatant brigades, is the need to completely rebuild and expand their supporting arms. Things such as Preventative Medicine, Technical Intelligence Collection, Civil Military Affairs, Salvage units, etc. Building those capabilities take the longest, and are key. \n   1. Essentially this would build a new Army or Army Corps for Use in later 2023. Developing 3-4 Western Equipped Brigades, C4I and Enablers, as well as the higher support elements will allow them to build a separate maneuver force. \n   2. Developing some additional Brigades as an Interim solution to allow for the rotation of Ukrainian forces currently on the lines to be rotated. This also allows for other forces to rest, re-equip and more importantly maintain a strategic reserve, as Maintenance of a Reserve is the most critical thing in warfare. \n4. **Leveraging private sector for infrastructure assistance -** There is a great role for the private sector, especially if aid funding enables them to establish and create operations in Ukraine. \n5. **A new Trade framework for post war Ukraine**\\- Nothing gets nothing. Like I said, the Blackwater deal is great, but there does need to be trade agreements on the table for the future. I believe that it is past the phase of worrying if there will be a Ukraine tomorrow, and we now need to look at what a future Ukraine looks like.",

All evidence we have confirms that yes, Russia has made significant advances in the city and might indeed capture it, though that is not guaranteed. We will have to wait and see what will come of the latest Russian assault--it does appear Ukraine is pulling out of the city, though a dense fog of war has descended in that part of the front.\n\nWhat interests me the most is how, after mobilization, that main line of troops doing the bulk of the offensive work for Russia are still the PMCs like Wagner. At least, that is the impression that the Russian milbloggers give. The simplest explanation is that Wagner is savvy with modern media like tiktok while the traditional military is not; hence why we see Wagner do the bulk of the fighting. I'm more partial to that explanation than the one that Russia is not using its mobilized men over morale fears. The fighting videos I've seen the past few days have all been grueling urban warfare, soldiers on both sides grimly describing their daily jobs: clearing out large apartment buildings, room by room. Without encircling the city, all the Russians need are warm bodies who can fire a rifle, and I doubt they'd be reluctant to used mobilized bodies, even with morale concerns. That being said, Wagner troops are still being used heavily.\n\nIn any case, we probably need a deeper reflection on what this all means when a modern, great power military is reverting from mobilized conscripts to contracted mercenaries. If it seems antiquated, it is--Putin's military tactics seems to have more in common with the Western European armies of the 16th and 17th century than any more modern army, at least when you look at it from this glance: using a few thousand mercenaries as a roving attack force to pounce on underprotected villages and to square off against other mercenary forces (Ukraine has Mozart, after all). In that way, Putin's army might as well be the army of imperial Spain. \n\nI'm morbidly curious to see what would happen if a larger war did break out with NATO. Would both sides revert back to the post-Napoleonic total war model of thrusting every living soul into the war effort, to be ground up into dust? Or would NATO copy the Russians, create their own PMC, and let that fight endlessly in across the steppes of Ukraine and Russia? Before this war: we took Wagner semi-seriously as a bad guy doing bad things for Russia in Africa. Now they're Putin's seemingly main offensive force in Ukraine.
