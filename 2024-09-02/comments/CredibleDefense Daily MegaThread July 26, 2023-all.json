Their comments dovetailed with reports from the battlefield on Wednesday, where artillery battles flared along the southern front line in the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nAnd Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s chief spokesman, reported a \u201cmassive\u201d assault and fierce battles south of Orikhiv, a town that Ukraine holds about 60 miles north of the Sea of Azov. Vladimir Rogov, an official appointed by Moscow in southern Ukraine, said the assault involved Ukrainian troops who had been trained abroad and were equipped with about 100 armored vehicles, including German-made Leopards and American-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles.\n\nAnother Russian occupation official in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeny Balitsky, said that Ukraine had made 36 attempts to shell settlements in the region since Tuesday. Russian assertions that the Ukrainian attacks had been repelled could not be immediately verified.\n\nUkrainian troops along the southern front said in interviews on Wednesday that they were steadily pushing Russian troops back, but their progress had been incremental with no major breakthroughs. They have been slowed by minefields, and some said the biggest obstacles were Russia\u2019s withering artillery fire and airstrikes.\n\nUkrainian officials have told U.S. officials that the enlarged Ukrainian force would try to advance south through Russia\u2019s minefields and other fortifications toward the city of Tokmak, and, if successful, on to Melitopol, on the coast.\n\nTheir goal is to sever the so-called land bridge between Russian-occupied Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula, or at least advance far enough to put the strategically important peninsula within range of Ukrainian artillery. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and uses it as the base for its Black Sea fleet as well as to supply its forces in the south.\n\nThe new operation, if successful, could take one to three weeks, Ukrainian officials have told officials in Washington.\n\nHowever, little has gone according to plan since the counteroffensive started early in June, and officials at the White House and Pentagon said on Wednesday they were watching the increased activity with keen interest.\n\n\u201cThis is the big test,\u201d said one senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",

Excerpts:\n\n>\u201cThey are constantly attacking us,\u201d said Lt. Col. Oleh Matviychuk, a 49-year-old battalion commander with Ukraine\u2019s 100th Territorial Defense Brigade. \u201cThey are looking for a weak place and then they storm.\u201d\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>Oleg, a 50-year-old doctor who is working as a frontline medic with the 100th Brigade, said that after weeks of seeing almost no wounded soldiers, he is now racing to Ukrainian positions to tend to wounds every day \u2014 a testament to a more aggressive Russian assault.\n\n>In recent days, the Russians have claimed small breakthroughs up and down the lines from Kupiansk to Kreminna 60 miles to the south. Kyiv is sending experienced units to reinforce the lines in the area.

Alongside shortages in demining equipment, Ukraine also faces shortfalls in crucial airpower. Kyiv\u2019s soldiers have been cut down by strafing from Russian helicopters as they attempt to advance. \n\n>The leaked German military assessment claimed that Kyiv was failing to implement Nato-standard tactics by attacking in units composed of too few men - and not simultaneously engaging infantry, artillery and tanks in \u201ccombined arms warfare\u201d.\n\n>It blamed Ukraine for promoting combat veterans over unproven soldiers who had been trained at Western boot camps.\n\n>Mr Heappey, who is a front-runner to replace Ben Wallace as defence secretary, defended the Ukrainian advance, saying it had to be acknowledged that Kyiv was up against defences that had been prepared for six months.\n\n>While Russia\u2019s professional army is greatly diminished and relies more on demoralised conscripts, Kyiv still faces an adversary that has a strong fighting tradition and will \u201cnever be a pushover, no matter the odds,\u201d he said.\n\n>The minister, who is in Busan for the 70th anniversary of the armistice that halted the Korean War in 1953, said he would raise the prospect of Seoul making a bigger contribution to Ukraine\u2019s war effort in conversations with Korean officials.\n\n>Pressure has been mounting on South Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s biggest stockpiles of ammunition and a vibrant defence industry, to supply arms to Ukraine that it desperately needs.\n\n>Kyiv\u2019s ambassador to Seoul recently told the BBC that South Korean weapons could \u201cchange the course of the war,\u201d but it has so far limited its support to joining international sanctions and providing more than $200 million (\u00a3155 million)  in humanitarian aid.\n\n>\u201cIf the Korean government is able and willing to provide more to Ukraine that would be incredibly welcome,\u201d said Mr Heappey.\n\n>But he recognised that South Korea, which faces constant warmongering from the nuclear-armed North, stockpiled munitions and maintained manufacturing capacity as it faced \u201can existential threat that they consider to be live and present every day.\u201d\n\nObligatory Mike Tyson quote, etc., but there are some who have been advocating for the experienced troops to be the leaders, while others are calling for NATO trained greenhorns to be the leaders. Not sure exactly what the answer is, but it'd seem to an amateur like myself that leadership isn't the main issue here.",

Kyiv\u2019s soldiers have been cut down by strafing from Russian helicopters as they attempt to advance. </p>\n\n<p>The leaked German military assessment claimed that Kyiv was failing to implement Nato-standard tactics by attacking in units composed of too few men - and not simultaneously engaging infantry, artillery and tanks in \u201ccombined arms warfare\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>It blamed Ukraine for promoting combat veterans over unproven soldiers who had been trained at Western boot camps.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Heappey, who is a front-runner to replace Ben Wallace as defence secretary, defended the Ukrainian advance, saying it had to be acknowledged that Kyiv was up against defences that had been prepared for six months.</p>\n\n<p>While Russia\u2019s professional army is greatly diminished and relies more on demoralised conscripts, Kyiv still faces an adversary that has a strong fighting tradition and will \u201cnever be a pushover, no matter the odds,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The minister, who is in Busan for the 70th anniversary of the armistice that halted the Korean War in 1953, said he would raise the prospect of Seoul making a bigger contribution to Ukraine\u2019s war effort in conversations with Korean officials.</p>\n\n<p>Pressure has been mounting on South Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s biggest stockpiles of ammunition and a vibrant defence industry, to supply arms to Ukraine that it desperately needs.</p>\n\n<p>Kyiv\u2019s ambassador to Seoul recently told the BBC that South Korean weapons could \u201cchange the course of the war,\u201d but it has so far limited its support to joining international sanctions and providing more than $200 million (\u00a3155 million)  in humanitarian aid.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf the Korean government is able and willing to provide more to Ukraine that would be incredibly welcome,\u201d said Mr Heappey.</p>\n\n<p>But he recognised that South Korea, which faces constant warmongering from the nuclear-armed North, stockpiled munitions and maintained manufacturing capacity as it faced \u201can existential threat that they consider to be live and present every day.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obligatory Mike Tyson quote, etc., but there are some who have been advocating for the experienced troops to be the leaders, while others are calling for NATO trained greenhorns to be the leaders. Not sure exactly what the answer is, but it&#39;d seem to an amateur like myself that leadership isn&#39;t the main issue here.</p>\n</div>",

They also developed low observability munitions like the JASSM and LRASM, anti radar munitions like HARM and MALD, and can have some kind of jamming aircraft on virtually ever sortie.\n\nThe reason people dog the A-10 so much and point to the F-35 as the 21st century paradigm for air support is on display right now in Ukraine. IADS have gotten really good, and Russia's doctrine and air tech are stuck in an era when this wasn't yet a reality.

A pee would normally just be done beside the nearest tree or bush or in the open, anywhere outside the  trench really but you'd try to keep it a good few yards away.\n\nIf its unsafe to leave the trench you could dig a hole inside the trench at one side or in a designated (and marked) spot if the trench was larger and use that.

Sometimes troops poo'd into small plastic bags and threw that out of the trench or buried it in the trench.

Not knowing pretty much anything about the program, my only question would be if the Redback costs significantly more than the Lynx. Those are the only two certain cost and benefits to be weighed. The other potential benefits are more hypothetical.\n\nThe possible synergistic effects of adding Lynx production would have been that big of a benefit if it did come to pass. However, having a diversified supplier of equipment could also help with future competition or supply. Especially since Rheinmetall is looking at Ukraine for their future expansions, which has the potential to threaten vehicle production in other countries if it were to get large enough. \n\nThere's also a chance that by choosing the Redback they reinforce their ties with a neighboring country that is facing similar issues. Rheinmetall is a mostly European/NATO company, and their focus on Ukraine is going to reinforce that. Australia is neither (though a close NATO partner) so building closer relationships with traditional US allies in their vicinity in addition to AUKUS makes sense.

Not knowing pretty much anything about the program, my only question would be if the Redback costs significantly more than the Lynx. Those are the only two certain cost and benefits to be weighed. The other potential benefits are more hypothetical.</p>\n\n<p>The possible synergistic effects of adding Lynx production would have been that big of a benefit if it did come to pass. However, having a diversified supplier of equipment could also help with future competition or supply. Especially since Rheinmetall is looking at Ukraine for their future expansions, which has the potential to threaten vehicle production in other countries if it were to get large enough. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also a chance that by choosing the Redback they reinforce their ties with a neighboring country that is facing similar issues. Rheinmetall is a mostly European/NATO company, and their focus on Ukraine is going to reinforce that. Australia is neither (though a close NATO partner) so building closer relationships with traditional US allies in their vicinity in addition to AUKUS makes sense.

I know they used reinforced concrete in some of their bunkers along the old Donbas frontline, but I don't know if making a lot of that kind of thing is a priority for their limited war industry right now.\n\nJust having time to conduct normal infantry entrenching operations along the northern borders will make Ukraine much more resilient if attacked in that direction again. However, I doubt this is anything like a continuous manned trench line which you might expect in the Western Front of WW1. I haven't really seen anything like that even in the densest sections of active fighting in the Donbas or the south.

The problem is the variability of the system, and the lack of knowledge we have about that variability. At any given moment of time, the shell is experiencing the following forces:\n\n1. Gravity. This varies (slightly) with altitude and is very well characterized.\n\n2. Drag. This is dependent on the velocity of the shell, and acts opposite the direction of the shell. The problem is that drag is dependent on the density of air, and the density of air varies significantly and somewhat unpredictably with altitude. We have models of this behavior, like the exponential atmospheric model, that do an okay job. But it's not perfect.\n\n3. Wind. This is the tricky one. Wind can act along any direction, can vary its intensity over time, and also varies with altitude and spatial position. Additionally, the wind drag term requires knowledge of the shape of the shell normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the shell in order to calculate a coefficient of drag and its cross-sectional area. And these terms change depending on the direction of the wind experienced by the shell, which again, varies based on altitude and spatial position.\n\nIf you were to figure out a way to predict the wind along the trajectory, you would still run into the problem of *precision*. That is to say, the artillery guns are fired using a mechanism to control the angle of the barrel. These have a certain amount of imprecision like any machine. But being off by an arcsecond might change your shell by several feet, several dozen feet, or several hundred feet; I have no idea the tolerance of an artillery barrel. But I know it's not perfect.\n\nAll that said, our problem is that we just can't accurately model everything involved with the trajectory of an artillery shell. It's inherently inaccurate. The only thing we could do to improve accuracy further is to implement a guidance, navigation, and control system on the shell. In other words, something that tells it where it needs to go, where it is at any given time, and something that steers it and corrects its course. That's the origin of, say, guided artillery shells like Excalibur. \n\nProblem is, GNC systems are expensive. But hey, they pay my bills, so I'm okay with that.",

            "body": "> I guess I ultimately don\u2019t understand the hostility Russia has with the west in general. In Soviet times there was an ideological/competitive reason at least. [...] If a lot of this anger is about the US invading Iraq, I still don\u2019t understand it. I would think that the Russians would be be more nervous about the Chinese l, not the US who they know is not going to invade Russia.\n\nNeither the use of hostility towards some Western powers, nor good terms with a dangerous neighbour are new phenomenons.\n\nLet's start with the former. In one of the earliest formulations on Cold War doctrine, his infamous Long Telegram, George Kennan noted that the political establishment of his time was walking in the ideological footsteps of a long lines of chronically paranoid regimes. The Marxist line of history, animated by its strict historical determinism, offered ideological justification for the instinctive fear of the outside world that the early Soviet political establishment felt, and turned out to be an extraordinary vehicle for a militarisation of Soviet society that enabled better and deeper government control. However, Kennan noted that this way of using the perception of an outside threat to mobilise and guarantee internal support was not new: its ideological support was otherwise the only novel aspect that distinguished the Bolshevik regime from a \"long succession of cruel and wasteful Russian rulers who have relentlessly forced country on to ever new heights of military power in order to guarantee external security of their internally weak regimes\".\n\nKennan was, of course, writing from his own ideological perspective, and he was also oversimplifying things considerably. Summarizing the policy of a 30 year-old federal government, anchored in a very foreign ideology, operating in a foreign land inahbited by dozens of diverse peoples with very foreign cultures is bound to be reductionist and also wrong to some degree.\n\nHowever, his observation that this hostility was instinctive and rooted in a long history of diffuse hostility aimed at the outside world in general more than at a particular threat, and that Russian political regimes have used this as an internal tool, was not incorrect. There are parallels to this in Western regimes as well, so it's not like this was some peculiar evil Soviet innovation.\n\nThat the regime and its favourites are not hostile towards the West is pretty obvious. Virtually every Russian politician's children study abroad, even though Russia does actually have a solid academic tradition. Many of them live abroad. They own businesses abroad, so their own economic situation is very much tied to that of the \"collective West\". These are not things that you do if you expect imminent retaliation from a russophobic West. They are things you *might* do if you were hostile to the West but, just like animosity towards Western ideals wasn't universal in Soviet circles, and animosity towards Western goods and services was practically non-existent, so animosity towards the West is not exactly universal in Russian political circles, even though it might be a sore point at the highest level.\n\nWhat's said on TV is a whole other story and just ties in to the older Soviet tradition of using the perception of outside threat as a valuable internal tool.\n\nThe most staggering example of the latter -- a surprising alliance with a hostile neighbour -- also dates from Stalin's time. Stalin, and much of the political leadership of his time, expected that confrontation between communist and capitalist states was inevitable. Attempting to justify the unthinkable Ribbentrop-Molotov pact to his Bulgarian communist counterpart, Georgi Dimitrov, Stalin noted that the alliance with one capitalist faction against another was temporary, and that confrontation with the remaining faction was necessary.\n\nThere is ample historical animosity between Russia and China but there is also considerable reason for collaboration. They share a common enemy and, while the Chinese government's ideology is *formally* different and largely incompatible with a strategic alliance with Russia, the two governments have a lot of common ground, they just can't go live on TV admitting it.\n\nIn any case, both of them share two very compatible high-level convictions:\n\n1. That confrontation with the West is likely, if not inevitable, and \n2. That a steep decline of the West is inevitable and has likely began\n\nso there is ample reason for them to fight the good fight together.\n\n> Does Russia have no interest in normalizing relations with the west? It seems like they\u2019re content to never talk or deal with Europe or the US again, which I personally don\u2019t understand. \n\nIt does. The Soviet Union had no qualms thrash talking the US while also subsisting on US grain, and similarly the Russian Federation went from denouncing capitalist pigs to IMF loans in literally just a few months.\n\nJust obviously not now. They're not wrong about it, mind you, recent European history would suggest that once a peace is negotiated, regardless of terms, greed will follow its natural course and allow trade to resume.",

Hes very clearly been involved in some shady business, which led him first to being fired and then to him filing a whistleblower complaint. Had he kept things straight he would, IMO, have had good grounds to allege that there has been a cover up. But instead hes gone down the route of grift, perhaps realizing there is more money in book deals and Joe Rogan appearances than actually briefing Congress on the things he was tasked with doing.\n\nI am increasingly of the persuasion that the UAPs he was meant to investigate are indeed systems built by rival nations for use against American assets. Surveillance balloons, drones, drone swarms, very sophisticated EW assets, and perhaps even some hyper sonic test vehicles. I am especially persuaded by the idea that surveillance craft with very advanced EW gear is shadowing American forces, especially CVNs. If you were designing some kind of EW gear, the golden apple would be equipment which could spoof the brain of, for example, an F-18. Trick it into sending the pilot incorrect speed, position, and targeting data. We already know that Chinese spy balloons are actually quite sophisticated, indeed many are more sophisticated than the ones recently shot down and can do very impressive things considering their size and altitude. Drones can make very unusual and rapid changes in speed and direction. If you make a quad-rotor with, say, jet turbines you'd get something which performs very unusually indeed. \n\nMoreover the conspiracy I think Grusch uncovered was that the DoD is not only well aware of what these devices are an who built them, but that theyve been generally unwilling to share this info with most members of Congress. What were seeing play out isn't so much a battle between the MIB and people who want to make the aliens public, but rather a constitutional battle between the military and executive branches, who don't want to tell Congress about the Chinese spy drones they've shot down, and Congress who thinks they really ought to be told. There is some reason for concern, during World War Two [one Congressmen who couldn't keep his mouth shut](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/congressman-andrew-may-caused-the-death-of-800-submarine-crewmen-during-wwii.html) ended up costing the lives of probably 800 sailors. Perhaps the DoD is now concerned that if it was revealed that China and Russia had very very sophisticated surveillance drones, it would unintentionally reveal the limits of American understanding and push them into technologies which the US hadn't 'cracked' yet. Grusch threatened to go beyond DoD policy and so was fired, and thus became a whistleblower. This fits pretty well with what he said early on about the DoD knowing but covering up what UAPs were. IMO the alien stuff only came later as a grift when he realized hed probably lost his sweet DoD pension and needed a quick buck. \n\nRegarding your other questions, along the lines of UFOs there is increasingly good evidence that a lot of early UFO paranoia was stoked by the government. A recent [documentary alleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage_Men) that the Men in Black, that is the people who UFOlogists think go out and suppress stories of sightings and abductions, were in fact real. Its just that their mission wasn't to keep people quite, but to instead *convince* them that what they had seen was crazy (aliens from Mars) not plausible (aircraft of unusual size and shapes) Likewise there is [some evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/14/men-in-black-ufo-sightings-mirage-makers-movie) that similar teams of disinfo artists have been (and still are) at work presenting doctored photos and videos to help sow the seeds of conspiracy minded individuals for much the same purposes. So thats all to say that some of this shit is probably real, and if its real its been quite effective. \n\nTo your last question I'm sure there are a ton of military secrets, like ULTRA, which had a profound effect on strategy and operations. But the biggest coup I can think of, and one which is still relatively unknown because it was such a well kept secret for so long, was [VENONA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project). Project Venona was an intel operation in which the Russian diplomatic cables, which were routinely sent through under sea cables in NYC, were collected and cracked. Because of how Soviet intel operations worked, agents delivered messages all to one central clearing house in the DC embassy. The embassy then forwarded along sensitive intel to Moscow, with special urgent orders going in diplomatic bags and the day to day trash sent through cables. When the FBI cracked the Russian's code they were able to identify basically every member of the Russian intelligence network in the US by their code name, and then through old fashioned investigation eventually identified many of the people involved. It basically destroyed Russian hard espionage in North America for a generation, and is a big reason why the KGB switched from spying to political subversion in the US. Also while Venona mostly wrapped up in the 1950s, the wedge it gave the FBI into Russian coms opened the door to snoop messages for basically the entire rest of the Cold War. While not everything could be read, enough was to help maintain control over Russian intel ops.",

The official agreed to speak on condition of anonymity given the confidential nature of the discussions.\n> \n> \u201cThere is an eminent need for track 1.5 diplomacy when the world gets closed off as it has now,\u201d the official said. \n> \n> Meetings between the U.S. and officials in the Kremlin have been taking place at least twice a month, often through an online format. \n> \n> \u201cI have been visiting Moscow at least every three months,\u201d the official said. \n>   \n> \n> \n> When it came to the Kremlin\u2019s willingness to lay its cards on the table, the official stated: \u201cWe were given some access to the Kremlin\u2019s thinking, though not as much as we would have liked.\u201d \n> \n> From his vantage point, sitting across from senior Kremlin officials and advisers, it was apparent that the greatest issue was that the Russians were unable to articulate what exactly they wanted and needed. \n> \n> \u201cThey don't know how to define victory or defeat. In fact, some of the elites to whom we spoke had never wanted the war in the first place, even saying it had been a complete mistake,\u201d said the official. \n> \n> \u201cBut now they\u2019re at war \u2014 suffering a humiliating defeat is not an option for these guys.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt was here that we made clear that the U.S. was prepared to work constructively with Russian national security concerns,\u201d the official added, breaking from the official U.S. line of squeezing Russia financially and isolating it internationally so as to prevent it from continuing its war against Ukraine. \n> \n> \u201cAn attempt to isolate and cripple Russia to the point of humiliation or collapse would make negotiating almost impossible \u2014 we are already seeing this in the reticence from Moscow officials,\u201d he said.\n> \n> \u201cIn fact, we emphasized that the U.S. needs, and will continue to need, a strong enough Russia to create stability along its periphery. The U.S. wants a Russia with strategic autonomy in order for the U.S. to advance diplomatic opportunities in Central Asia. We in the U.S. have to recognize that total victory in Europe could harm our interests in other areas of the world. \n> \n> \u201cRussian power,\u201d the official concluded, \u201cis not necessarily a bad thing.\u201d \n> \n> On the subject of Russia's deepening relationship with China, the official acknowledged that completely severing ties between Moscow and Beijing was unrealistic. However, efforts should be made to limit the extent of this relationship, he argued Washington\u2019s goal is to strike a balance that prevents an overwhelming consolidation of Russian power while fostering diplomatic opportunities in Asia, where Moscow plays a significant role.\n> \n> \u201cThis does not mean we are abandoning Ukraine or Europe,\u201d the official was quick to note. \u201cRather, we want to find ways of guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s independence while bringing Russia back as a more creative player in European security.\u201d\n> \n> Both the U.S. and Russia should have used greater strategic imagination in the decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the official argued further. In recent years, Moscow has become especially resentful after the Biden administration did not prioritize efforts to rebuild strained U.S.-Russia ties.\n> \n> The Biden administration thus realized \u2014 albeit too late \u2014 that Russia sought to be taken seriously, with its military build-up at Ukraine\u2019s borders in 2021 a tactic to gain attention. \n> \n> \u201cThere has been a severe lack of sustained U.S.-Russia dialogue on European security,\u201d the official said, \u201cand our negotiations in early 2022, prior to the full-scale invasion should have remained confidential, but the Russians proceeded to leak the details. This made the negotiation process far more difficult.\u201d\n> \n> The official admitted, however, that no matter how much work the U.S. might now undertake, sooner or later Russia and Ukraine would have to sit down together at the negotiating table. \n> \n> \u201cWe suggested setting up a number of diplomatic channels in order to satisfy the desires of all the parties involved,\u201d he said. \u201cThere firstly needs to be a serious U.S.-Russia channel, as these are the only two countries powerful enough to negotiate security in Europe. There must of course be a channel between Ukraine and Russia, another between Russia and the EU; and one between Russia and the Global South.\u201d\n> \n> During the discussions, it became evident that Ukraine\u2019s chances of regaining its occupied territories were extremely slim. Crimea remains a particularly contentious issue, as Ukraine asserts its intent to reclaim the region which Russia annexed in 2014.\n> \n> \u201cIf Russia thought it might lose Crimea,\u201d the official said, \u201cit would almost certainly resort to [using] tactical nuclear weapons.\u201d \n> \n> The official noted that Washington had also offered to help conduct fair referendums in the Russian-occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, in which residents would vote on whether they wished to be part of Ukraine or Russia. \n> \n> Russia apparently declined this offer and claimed to have annexed the territories in September 2022 following referendums widely viewed as a sham.\n> \n> But the official expressed a sense of impasse in the ongoing secret talks. \u201cIn Russian diplomacy, everything is now linked, all built around the locus of the war making it impossible to do any productive forms of diplomacy.\u201d \n> \n> The problem was less with the Russian elite as a whole than it was with Putin specifically, he explained. \n> \n> \u201cPutin is the major block to all progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. administration has made at least  one attempt to speak with the Kremlin but Putin himself refused.\u201d \n> \n> For this reason, he argued, Washington \u201cshould begin reaching out to the anti-war Russian elite and begin making progress with them.\u201d \n> \n> If there was support among the elite for another leader, he said, \u201cousting Putin would not be impossible.\u201d",

Yes Russian society has serious issues, but if you want people to change their point of view, if you want a war to end with a stable peace, the worst thing you can do is ascribe a blanket of blame on a nation\u2019s society and population. \n\nRussia has a very different political system and culture the west. The vast majority of Russian people view themselves as imperial subjects on Russian land, not citizens with a political voice.
