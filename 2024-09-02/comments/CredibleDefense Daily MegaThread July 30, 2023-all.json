            "body": "ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) was founded via the Lagos Treaty of 1975. It initially contained fifteen members, essentially the entirety of what is generally considered to be West Africa. The organization has three official languages (English, French, and Portuguese) reflecting its members' colonial history and general diversity. Originally, the organization was aimed at joint economic development in the post-colonial world, but in 1993 the founding treaty was refined and their mandate expanded somewhat to \"collective self-sufficiency\" with the primary focus remaining economic coordination and development. Specifically, the refined goals are as follows:  \n\n\n>the harmonization and co-ordination of national policies and the promotion of integration programmes, projects and activities, particularly in food, agriculture and natural resources, industry, transport and communications, energy, trade, money and finance, taxation, economic reform policies, human resources, education, information, culture, science, technology, services, health, tourism, legal matters;  \nthe harmonization and co-ordination of policies for the protection of the environment;  \nthe promotion of the establishment of joint production enterprises;  \nthe establishment of a common market;  \nthe establishment of an economic union through the adoption of common policies in the economic, financial, social and cultural sectors, and the creation of a monetary union.  \nthe promotion of joint ventures by private sector enterprises and other economic operators, in particular through the adoption of a regional agreement on cross border investments;  \nthe adoption of measures for the integration of the private sectors, particularly the creation of an enabling environment to promote small and medium scale enterprises;  \nthe establishment of an enabling legal environment;  \nthe harmonisation of national investment codes leading to the adoption of a single Community investment code;  \nthe harmonization of standards and measures;  \nthe promotion of balanced development of the region, paying attention to the special problems of each Member State particularly those of landlocked and small island Member States;  \nthe encouragement and strengthening of relations and the promotion of the flow of information particularly among rural populations, women and youth organizations and socio-professional organizations such as associations of the media, business men and women, workers, and trade unions;  \nthe adoption of a Community population policy which takes into account the need for a balance between demographic factors and socio-economic development;  \nany other activity that Member States may decide to undertake jointly with a view to attaining Community objectives.\n\nPersonally, I would rate as one of the more successful multilateral African institutions, thanks largely to its continued longevity and economic successes. It is a fully developed organization consisting of a number of institutions and sub-institutions, ranging across the board to cover its goals. The driving control iof ECOWAS comes from the Authority of the Heads of State, a council of all the member heads of state. This council is led on a rotating, yearly basis by one head of state elected from among the group. It is really this body that sets the agenda for the rest of the organization. The current Chairman is Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu, the current President of Nigeria, which also happens to be ECOWAS' largest and most powerful member.   \n\n\nIn terms of membership, though ECOWAS currently consists of 15 states, the numbers and specific states have shifted since 1975. Cape Verde joined in 1977, Mauritania withdrew in 2000 (though regained associate membership in 2017 iirc), and Morocco has petitioned for membership (going nowhere). The most recent membership issues, however, have sprung from what is one fo the major crises of ECOWAS in the post-Cold War era: mitigating and preventing coups. In 2021, ECOWAS suspended Mali's membership due to a coup. Shortly thereafter in the same year, ECOWAS also suspended Guinea's membership for the same reason. Then, in 2022, they did the same thing to Burkina Faso. However, these responses, while potentially damaging, are far less dramatic and punitive than the earlier interventions the organization launched.\n\nIn the early 1990s, anglophone ECOWAS members established ECOMOG (Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group) as a multilateral task force to intervene in the Liberian civil war despite strenuous objections from mostly francophone members. Despite limited support from the United States, mostly in the form of logistics, ECOMOG had a mixed track record as an enforcement arm for stability in the region. It was plagued primarily with corruption and ill-discipline and since its main force was almost entirely Nigerian, it relied on that country's good graces as well.  It eventually withdrew from Liberia, but was deployed again to Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone in the late 90s (again with limited success). Largely at the prompting of the US, a second multilateral peacekeeping task force, ECOMIL (ECOWAS mission in Liberia) was deployed to Liberia in 2003 but shortly thereafter handed over operations to a UN mission, UNMIL. They also intervened with smaller forces in Guinea-Bissau in 2012 and Mali in 2013 (which was mostly France's show). The most recent intervention, as another poster mentioned, was in 2017 and was a large force of nearly 8,000 soldiers, primarily from Senegal with support from Nigeria. That intervention was largely successful, with very minimal violence and the resumption of proper governance in The Gambia, though the stabilization portion of the mission is still ongoing.   \n\n\nAs for the current threat, it is hard to say exactly how credible it is. ECOWAS response to coups in recent years has, as I mentioned, been tepid at best. That said, the threat is not idle. ECOWAS could quite conceivably launch a large-scale intervention into Niger to reassert governmental authority and oust the puschists. They could genuinely do this of their own accord and with their own internalized resources, but I think it's fairly likely they could call on either French or US support, almost certainly in the forms of logistics, if they chose to follow that route. Both France and the US have troops stationed in Niger, as well as a vested interest in maintaining a strong, friendly democratic government there. For France, it is both an issue of maintaining/support its post-colonial obligations and economic sphere. For the US, it's largely about preserving a base of operations for efforts to combat terrorist activities in Western Africa and also pushing back against potential Chinese and/or Russia influence in the region. Nigeria, ECOWAS' most powerful member and current overall leader, has its own issues with terrorism and instability and shares an extensive land border with Niger. As such, it has an almost certain vested interest in maintaining Nigerien stability. In fact, compared to previous ECOWAS interventions, this potential situation is the one that most directly impacts Nigeria and in the largest way. It has never had an ECOWAS crisis dropped on its doorstep and it therefore may push for an largely unilateral intervention with the organization's backing.  \n\n\nAll that being said, ECOWAS also has a track record of facilitating negotiations and diplomatic solutions to potential conflicts. I imagine that they will attempt to push that angle first before stepping towards an actual intervention. After the succession of coups since 2020, the ECOWAS leaders must be starting to feel a little concerned, and if Niger, which is relatively stable as African states go (or at least has been stable in recent years) can go like this, they all have to be a little unnerved. As such, very much not outside the realm of possibility to see them move away from the tepid responses here and finally put a foot down/set an example that they will no longer be tolerating such overthrows within the region. Given what I mentioned above re: the French and Americans, ECOWAS might also feel more international pressure to act than it did in the case of Guinea or Burkina Faso. On the overall scale of very unlikely to very likely, I would personally rate an ECOWAS intervention force at the end of their seven-day ultimatum as somewhat likely. IMO there is not a significant amount of evidence to support that the coup has broad strokes popular support among the Nigerien people and as one of ECOWAS largest members, both by population and geographical area, I think it behooves ECOWAS to act more so than they have in the past.",

The VDV is largely an offensive unit.  Given the size of the push, it's very possible they had help, but an assumption that an assault unit participated in an assault in their area is not based on \"literally nothing\".\n\n>We also have an article talking about Ukrainians taking heavy casualties in the forest, and admittance of retreat, extensive Russian fires in the area, and the commitment of reserves in service of holding an unfavorable position\n\nYes, but again, the article is almost exclusively talking about the situation much more south on the front in the Kreminna forest, not about the recently developed salient around Nadia.  It was well known that there's western gear there for a while now.  It's talking about a different battle.\n\n>Pejoratives and double standards for sources are beneath the usual norm for your posts.\n\nI don't think I've **ever** seriously taken an anonymous account of a battle of any sort in a vacuum.  Whereas, what exact sources of mine are you attacking?\n\nThe only sources I've brought up are the only ones I remotely trust on this matter, and that's a handful of mappers that claim this push even happened.

                            "body": ">Why was Hanit sailing along the Lebanese coast with its countermeasures and SAM system switched off?\n\nIn the message above I outline why the intelligence corps was not sharing intelligence with the forces. So while the IDF knew that Hezbollah had the capability to hit the ship, the intelligence was kept secret and not passed to the ship.\n\nAnd so the system was turned off as a safety measure to prevent accidental targeting of IAF jets over Lebanon.\n\n>Why the very casual initial approach at Bint Jbeil? \n\nConfuse in command. Initially a force of 5000 and significant support was assigned the task of attacking and taking Bint Jbel. But due to unclear and changing objectives from the politicians and high command the objective was changed again and again. Eventually what was left was a force of a couple of hundreds tasked with taking some houses in the outskirts of the town with no real military purpose.\n\n>Would Israel have fought like this if it was engaging Egypt or Syria? Of course not.\n\nNo due to the reasons I outlined in my post. The IDF and Israeli politicians did not set clear objectives.

It seems the new brigades in that sector were already deployed there in early or mid June, and not in July as I previously thought. It may have been the plan all along to have them relieve existing units there, rather than as a reaction to increased Russian offensive activity in the sector.\n\nIt's behind a paywall and in French, so here's the full article translated with deepl:\n\n> Ukraine: the deadly Russian push in Kreminna\n\n> A few hours after leaving the front line positions of the brigade under his command in the middle of the Serebryansky forest, the colonel, who requests anonymity, looks exhausted and throws himself on a bottle of water and a piece of meat in the bunker that serves as his command centre. Once he was full, he recounted his arrival with his men on the afternoon of Thursday 27 July, and his surprise at being caught in a massive artillery barrage signalling the imminent launch of a new Russian assault on Ukrainian positions. A quick decision had to be made.\n\n> He immediately decided to withdraw to the rear, at the risk of being hit by the mortar shells falling thickly around him. A few minutes later, when he had reached a rough shelter, he remembers a huge explosion and the astonishment of the other men. Only later would he be informed that a Russian BTR-MD Rakushka, an armoured personnel carrier, had just blown up on a Ukrainian mine while trying to penetrate their defences.\n\n> The next day, in the headquarters of this brigade recently deployed to one of the most violent points on the front line in north-eastern Ukraine, the commander proudly pointed out on a map the location of the previous day's explosion, some one hundred metres from the position he was in. And to think that the sappers from his brigade had laid the mine that blew up the BTR-MD only the day before the attack... The colonel seems to have come to his senses after having narrowly escaped death. \"We're outnumbered, we don't have their firepower, we have to be better\", he explains to his soldiers, justifying his sorties into extremely risky positions. \"I've come to support my men in battle\", he says soberly.\n\n> His soldiers, deployed on the front line through the forest, are exposed to constant bombardment. If the officer goes to these extremely risky positions, it's because he feels it's his duty to visit them to \"increase their level of motivation and courage\". It takes courage and determination to hold these positions hastily dug in by Ukrainian soldiers. Positions that they are constantly changing, through this forest where the two enemy armies face each other, in the hell of combat where the bombardments are constant and the assaults repeated.\n\n> A shifting front line\n\n> While Ukraine has managed, at the cost of heavy losses, to recapture simple villages in the south of the country, here in the Kreminna region, Moscow's forces are conversely trying to break through the lines of the Ukrainian army. The small Ukrainian town occupied since the start of the war has become a logistics hub for the Russian army.\n\n> The Serebryansky forest, which separates the Ukrainian soldiers from Kreminna, has been a battleground for the two armies since the Kiev forces' lightning counter-offensive that liberated the Kharkiv region as well as part of the Donetsk region. At the beginning of winter 2022, caught up in their successes on the front lines, Ukrainian troops had crossed the woods until they approached the occupied town of Kreminna, before being pushed back.\n\n> In recent weeks, the intensity and regularity of Russian attempts to break through have intensified. In the forest overflown by drones and riddled with snipers, the front line is constantly in flux. \"One day you can be in one position, and the next day you're 50 metres further on\", explains Myroslav, an officer at the front. explains Myroslav, an officer in the same brigade, whom we met in the command centre. \"During the assaults, the Russians send in small groups to try and break through the Ukrainian defences\", explains the brigade commander. But before that, \"they bombard us with their artillery to clear the area and make it easier for their infantry to get through\".\n\n> The enemy is constantly attacking\n\n> While the Kremlin's forces are essentially on the defensive along the Ukrainian regions they occupy, from the east to the south of the country, they are on the offensive in this sector of north-eastern Ukraine. The battle taking place in the Serebryansky forest is the epicentre of the fighting on a hundred kilometre front line stretching from Kupiansk to Lyman, two towns recaptured in the autumn after more than six months of occupation.\n\n> Faced with the Russian push along this north-eastern line, the commander of the Ukrainian army, Oleksandr Syrsky, declared on Friday 28 July: \"The enemy is constantly attacking, using its most professional units. We are repelling numerous assaults in these areas every day. None of our positions have been lost. But the assaults were deadly. Determined to meet them, Kiev's forces have no choice but to deploy new brigades to hold the front. The commander of the Ukrainian brigade visiting his soldiers along the front line explained that he had been deployed with \"several other units\" in order to \"reinforce the area\" and resist enemy pressure at all costs.\n\n> For the Russian forces, breaking through the Serebryansky forest would open the way to the town of Lyman, a strategic road junction for continuing their offensive in the Donbass. Further north, as far as Kupiansk, the capture of the territories under Kiev's control would create a buffer zone for the occupied region of Luhansk, which Moscow has been claiming to control for a year.\n\n> While the Ukrainian high command assures us that the Russian defence lines have not given up any significant ground, some positions have had to be evacuated. Oktavian, or \"Odyssey\" as he is known, commander of the 408th battalion of the 21st mechanised brigade deployed in the direction of Kreminna for a month and a half, admits that he was forced to retreat because of the violence of the enemy assaults. Rather than talk of a tactical withdrawal, the career soldier, who became a civilian before the conflict, prefers to speak of a \"manoeuvre\" towards the rear lines, prepared in advance.\n\n> Since this former Odessa businessman was deployed to the front, he has observed a \"gradual\" increase in the intensity of the Russian assaults. For the past two weeks, his battalion's positions have come under direct attack from the Russian air force, which no longer hesitates to venture into the area. On 20 July, the stabilisation point to which wounded soldiers from his battalion were evacuated for rapid treatment before being taken to hospitals far from the front was destroyed by a bomb fired from an aircraft. The explosion killed one person and injured several others. \"According to our intelligence, the Russians are at their most intense, given the stock of ammunition and weapons they have,\" says the commander, who tries to reassure himself: \"There are more of them than us, but we're holding out.",

A few minutes earlier, in a command room, the soldier was watching a giant screen broadcast live images from a drone flying over a Russian position.

Three of my lads were killed,\" says Ihor. You never get used to that.\n\n> The soldiers we met all spoke of the disproportion between the human and material capacities of the Russians and those of the Ukrainian army. \"Russian drones outnumber our drones, and the same goes for our ammunition and the number of soldiers\", explains Volodymyr, whose nom de guerre is \"Gera\", commander of a company in the 32nd brigade, deployed on the western flank near Svatove.\n\n> Among the group of six assembled at the soldiers' base, three were able to take part in training at a NATO training centre in Germany for a month.

Starlinks real benefit is that having a ton of these in low earth orbit means latency is dramatically reduced, bandwidth is disturbed over more satellites, and by sheer numbers would be less likely to be disabled. \n\nFurther, does the military not already use the internet mission critical operations? I don't actually know. While presumably, the US DOD could fork over 10 billion to build its own network, surely it could compel SpaceX to give it priority traffic and disable non-military terminals in certain regions at the click of a mouse.\n\nPresumably, the bandwidth and latency of Starlink with direct laser connection would allow extremely high bandwidth and low latency that could permit stuff like human piloted fighter drones. Internet says current ping on a predator drone is like 2 seconds. Reducing that number to high video game level pings, say 250ms, would probably make certain kinds of systems more feasible.\n\nEdit: Presumably another benefit would be exactly what Ukraine is using it for now.

While presumably, the US DOD could fork over 10 billion to build its own network, surely it could compel SpaceX to give it priority traffic and disable non-military terminals in certain regions at the click of a mouse.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, the bandwidth and latency of Starlink with direct laser connection would allow extremely high bandwidth and low latency that could permit stuff like human piloted fighter drones. Internet says current ping on a predator drone is like 2 seconds. Reducing that number to high video game level pings, say 250ms, would probably make certain kinds of systems more feasible.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Presumably another benefit would be exactly what Ukraine is using it for now. A cheap makeshift comms network for equipping US allies in proxy wars.</p>\n</div>",

First of all, great for the latter! When the transfer was announced I had read an article that said they could be equipped just with a 12.7mm turret.\n\nAll this equipment belongs to the 21st Mechanized Brigade in all certainty. I find it likely that this brigade may have only one tank company with ten Striv 122s (I don't think they also have Leopard 2A4s and I assume they are not mixed with Soviet tanks). So the 21st is currently one of the best equipped Ukrainian brigades, after the 47th and 82nd. We know that they are deployed around Nesvke (between Svatove and Kreminna, and they are already being employed, these days sadly a CV90 was damaged and captured by the Russians) - so they are being used for mostly defensive purposes. At the same time I am curious as to which brigade the Abrams-fielding tank battalion will be assigned to, perhaps one that will be equipped with the newly delivered Bradleys and/or Strykers, to form a brigade equipped only with the best of Western donations like the brigades mentioned above (the new 42nd Brigade, currently deployed in the Kreminna sector, was seen with Strykers during training but there was no update about that). Although I wonder if it will be one of the last formed brigades or if they might choose to give such equipment to a veteran brigade that has proven it deserves them (it could be the 93rd for instance, or the 92nd or the 72nd). But in that case we should see elements of these brigades pulled off from the front for re-training I guess.",

You can argue Putin had bad information, it doesn\u2019t really matter. He\u2019s a black box with an objective reality input and an action output. Whatever happened inside was irrational.\n\nI think you would agree that if he had declared \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 after a couple months, he would have been fine. So, clearly, time matters for him. \n\nThere are many examples of the irrationality of this whole war.

We all know that the base bleed ammo goes further, but how much of an effect does barrel length and charging have on the range of the non-base bleed variant (which is rated at 17km from an unknown barrel lenght, propably m109)?\n\n3. Will the rocket artillery variants be introduced too (do they still exist in quantity)? I know that the range is an issue for those as Ukraine has an incentive to keep their HIMARS and m270s out of counterbattery range, but a cluster saturation attack on defensive lines sounds like an enticing idea.",

Degrades the performance but doesn&#39;t prevent it.</p>\n\n<p>I have no knowledge of Starlink or anything related to jamming or protecting it.

        "body": "Deepstate has finally posted a summary:\n\n\ud83d\udd76\ud83d\udd76 at the front as of the end of the day on July 30, 2023\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Beilomoskovskiy, Siverskyi and Bilhorodskyi shades \u2014 unchanged.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Matchmaking touch \u2014 despite two Katsap statements during the week about success near Sinkivka, none of them are true. There, the front did not change. Stabilization measures west of Karmazynivka finally bore fruit. To overcome the chaos on the site, hunters were involved, who expertly destabilize the situation. The enemy was not allowed to gain a foothold not only near Nadia, but also in the village itself. As a result of the battles in Novoyehorivka, the enemy supposedly remained only in the eastern part of the village. Thus, on July 30, 2023, the enemy has only Serhiyivka under full control. Of course, the enemy is using much larger forces in the Serebryan Forestry, but at the same time, it has not had significant success there.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Bakhmut direction - despite the statement of Western military analysts, who of course know better what is happening at the front than the military themselves, about the transition to full control of the village of Klishchiivka on July 25, the fighting in the village is still ongoing. Significant enemy reserves are concentrated in the northern part and the vicinity of the village. Battles are also taking place near Andriivka and Kurdyumivka. Although tiktokers from Akhmat-chai shoot videos of them fleeing, this does not make the task of our troops any easier. Katsap with the help of arty continues to hold on to each landing.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Avdiyivka touch - periodically the Katsapas go on assaults from Kruta Balka in the direction of Avdiyivka, but this does not cause changes in the LBZ. Near Nevelsky, the ZSU had partial success. In Marinka, fighting continues for the western part of the city, but no significant changes have been recorded.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Berdyansky shade - after the liberation of Staromayorskyi, hostilities take place along the lines: Pryutne, a cascade of reservoirs, Zavitne Desire, the northern outskirts of Urozhany. The harvest for the enemy in two months turned into a ledge with a shaky position on the eastern flank. These factors complicate further defense of the village, despite the significant number of fortifications in the village itself. Deoccupation of this village will be a matter of time. It is worth checking with the insiders who vacated Urozhayne in June, how things are going with the de-occupation.\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f Zaporizhzhya touch - enough footage of the mass attack of 116 OMBr, which was sent between Robotine and Verbove, has already appeared. Unfortunately, there were footage of both our prisoners and the lost equipment. The enemy managed to regain part of the positions, in the rest the situation is either unknown or deadlocked. We were separated from success by unsuccessful actions on the flanks. Many people ask why Robotyn. The deeper the front, the smaller the concentration of minefields. If now the Defense Forces stop for a couple of months, then we will get again the rake that was in June. It is also worth noting that the Russian woman is again actively using propaganda, manipulating shots and very often showing the same places from different angles. We all need to take and analyze this information very carefully.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary: Ukraine has stabilized the Russian advance in Luhansk(recaptured some territory), is still fighting over Klishchiivka(I have seen a lot of brutal Russian footage released from Klishchiivka), has captured Staromaoirske(which complicates the Russian defense of Urozhaine), and seems to have  lost at least some of their captured positions in Robotyne. People bashed me on a previous comment for saying this attack was a failure because my sources were \"not credible\" and here we have further confirmation of the fact. Ukraine needlessly lost equipment and men for territory that the Russians have at least partially recaptured. For what its worth, Suriyak also is mapping Russians recapturing territory near Robotyne, basically eliminating any progress the Ukrainians made with that attack. No significant changes elsewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: he raises an important point I want to discuss, which is that \"Many people ask why Robotyn. The deeper the front, the smaller the concentration of minefields. If now the Defense Forces stop for a couple of months, then we will get again the rake that was in June.\" This line of reasoning makes sense, but I don't see how the Ukrainians can make significant advances here short of catching the Russians with their pants down in one of their attacks. That is, it feels like the only way for Ukraine to capture meaningful territory(like Robotyne and Verbove) is relying on the Russians to make a series of serious mistakes rather than being able to outright defeat a competent Russian defense.\n\nWe have seen company sized(and maybe battalion sized) armored advances get utterly wiped out. We have multiple reports that Ukrainians struggle to coordinate brigade sized operations. Recently, Ukraine has been using primarily infantry advances to take territory(which almost never bode well), but I just can't see how infantry advances will get Ukraine towns like Robotyne or Verbove, much less Tokmak. The Russians have released quite a few aftermath pictures and videos of Ukrainian infantry squads gunned down, and nothing I've read even seems to suggest that the Ukrainians are taking 1-1 casualties with the Russians. It's easy to say in hindsight, but it feels like the Ukrainians would be in a much better spot than they are right now(in terms of territory captured and general \"progress\") if they focused whatever resources they've committed in the Tokmak axis to the Velyka Novosilka axis).",

They would have likely gone the same or more.\n\nThey lost 40 units of heavy equipment **because their attack failed**.  Which is also why they didn't advance past 2 km!\n\nThat's why (in most cases) trying to view this as a \"trade\" doesn't work - you're not exchanging one thing for the other.  You're trying to win individual battles (in many cases, engagements is more correct).  The USSR didn't \"trade\" 6k tanks for however much territory they got immediately after Kursk, they won a battle despite losing 6k tanks.  \n\nYou could say that the USSR \"traded\" those tanks for winning the battle.  But even that doesn't work, because usually the cost of losing is **higher** than the cost of winning.  It's not a trade if less costs more and/or more costs less.  And usually when a battle is won or lost that changes the trajectory of the war a lot more than the territory lost.\n\nThat's the fundamental issue people had with your point (I imagine, I haven't asked them, but that's what stands out as weird to me).  Not the fact that the push was poorly organized (which it was), that casualties were heavy (which they were), and that Ukraine needed to do better (which it does).
