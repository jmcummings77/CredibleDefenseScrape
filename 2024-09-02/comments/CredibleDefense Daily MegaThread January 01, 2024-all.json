As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

A [Ukrainian general](https://old.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/18vgyzo/ru_pov_afu_general_krivonos_just_one_corporation/) recently said that one Russian corporation produced 1321 cruise missiles in 2023. He was referring to [Tactical Missiles Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_Missiles_Corporation), which does not produce 100% of Russia's cruise missiles, with the P-800 Onyx and Iskander being produced in numbers by other firms. Given this, it seems likely that Russian cruise missile production equals or even surpasses that of the United States. I looked over [Army](https://www.asafm.army.mil/Portals/72/Documents/BudgetMaterial/2023/pbr/Army%20FY%202023%20Budget%20Overview.pdf), [Air Force](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/28/2002964733/-1/-1/1/FY%202023%20DAF%20BUDGET.PDF), and [Navy](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21562409/fy23todate.pdf) procurement figures and came up with a figure of 1311 cruise and tactical ballistic missiles having been produced in 2023 (JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, and Tomahawk (I'm assuming all production numbers in the TACTOM section refer to new missiles produced)). This doesn't seem to include export production, although I couldn't find good figures for that. In any case, it seems that Russian cruise missile production in 2023 roughly equaled that of the United States and, given that it continues to increase, likely exceeds US production currently.",

Do we expect generals to meet in a field and do a handshake agreement to fight at a specific point? Israel is invading Gaza. Hamas is fighting where they live. There is nowhere else to fight, and Palestinians have the the right to armed struggle.

            "body": "I don't see any blatant discrepancies looking through this from a random sampling and, by posting this information so openly, I don't expect anyone who deeply scours it will find much either. The issue I will point out is trying to compare this list to the one by BBC/Mediazona (henceforth B/M) and then concluding the total counts are equal as a result. There is a **substantial difference** in data collection between both sides that makes such an extrapolation plainly wrong... though not obvious. See, both sides report from the following sources: social media posts, local media reports, and official statements. However the key difference is the access to *official statements*. \n\nBetween 28 February 2022 and 12 October 2023, [454 presidential decrees were issued on posthumous awards to 14,402 Ukrainian servicemen + law enforcement](https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/11/18/ukraines-grim-toll-over-30000-defenders-killed-in-war-with-russia-civic-group-says/) with the full lists freely available online. This website makes full use of this information. You can distinguish these results by the [pages of names](https://i.ibb.co/rQRYm88/Screenshot-2024-01-01-132611.png) without ages or locations usually. Conveniently, you can't filter for those '?' results, but here are two examples ([1](https://ualosses.org/soldier/7e6f5c3f-816f-4621-a65f-f759a2c3defc/), [2](https://ualosses.org/soldier/3e66c4bb-733a-44f3-ae15-552f9e41d88f/)). Another contributing point to this is the 'Ukrainian Memory Book' project where, since 2014, they had been collecting names of dead Ukrainian servicemen. They published this information publicly during this war as well until May 31 2022, and this website utilizes them just as well (example [1](https://ualosses.org/soldier/e3807b57-ba42-4b8e-ba21-8065854d9b0c/), [2](https://ualosses.org/soldier/2ebc8700-1607-43cd-8a95-0cdb4da20b2c/)). Trusting a third party list like this is also something the B/M list would not do - but that's a minor point.\n\nAs far as I know, there are no huge lists posted on the Russian side compiling thousands of their dead like these two examples. So, while 'UA Losses' can collect half their entries just from these lists, B/M do not have that luxury for their count. Neither list is fully comprehensive, but the B/M list is almost definitely less so by not being handed ~20,000 names with zero research effort.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t see any blatant discrepancies looking through this from a random sampling and, by posting this information so openly, I don&#39;t expect anyone who deeply scours it will find much either. The issue I will point out is trying to compare this list to the one by BBC/Mediazona (henceforth B/M) and then concluding the total counts are equal as a result. There is a <strong>substantial difference</strong> in data collection between both sides that makes such an extrapolation plainly wrong... though not obvious. See, both sides report from the following sources: social media posts, local media reports, and official statements. However the key difference is the access to <em>official statements</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Between 28 February 2022 and 12 October 2023, <a href=\"https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/11/18/ukraines-grim-toll-over-30000-defenders-killed-in-war-with-russia-civic-group-says/\">454 presidential decrees were issued on posthumous awards to 14,402 Ukrainian servicemen + law enforcement</a> with the full lists freely available online. This website makes full use of this information. You can distinguish these results by the <a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/rQRYm88/Screenshot-2024-01-01-132611.png\">pages of names</a> without ages or locations usually. Conveniently, you can&#39;t filter for those &#39;?&#39; results, but here are two examples (<a href=\"https://ualosses.org/soldier/7e6f5c3f-816f-4621-a65f-f759a2c3defc/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ualosses.org/soldier/3e66c4bb-733a-44f3-ae15-552f9e41d88f/\">2</a>). Another contributing point to this is the &#39;Ukrainian Memory Book&#39; project where, since 2014, they had been collecting names of dead Ukrainian servicemen. They published this information publicly during this war as well until May 31 2022, and this website utilizes them just as well (example <a href=\"https://ualosses.org/soldier/e3807b57-ba42-4b8e-ba21-8065854d9b0c/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ualosses.org/soldier/2ebc8700-1607-43cd-8a95-0cdb4da20b2c/\">2</a>). Trusting a third party list like this is also something the B/M list would not do - but that&#39;s a minor point.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, there are no huge lists posted on the Russian side compiling thousands of their dead like these two examples. So, while &#39;UA Losses&#39; can collect half their entries just from these lists, B/M do not have that luxury for their count. Neither list is fully comprehensive, but the B/M list is almost definitely less so by not being handed ~20,000 names with zero research effort. There are other factors that will lead to differences such as how many people post obituaries and how people are searching for them, but those are unknowable. I think it&#39;s fair to assess that this release does not contradict anything that we know about and that Russian losses are higher than Ukrainian.</p>\n</div>",

These acts fall into five categories:</p>\n\n<p>Killing members of the group</p>\n\n<p>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group</p>\n\n<p>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part</p>\n\n<p>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group</p>\n\n<p>Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a much broader list than what most people imagine when they think of genocide, and there are aspects of both conflicts that could be argued to fall into one or more of these categories. Certainly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine satisfies more and to a greater extent the conditions for classifying something as a genocide, but where exactly to draw the line is a subjective decision.</p>\n</div>",
