Then, they can use the coax for suppressive fire, which frees the infantry MGs to focus on moving forward and reduces the ammo they need to carry on foot to achieve the same suppression effect. e.g., if there are 20 APCs plus 100-ish infantry assaulting a fortified position held by 30 or so enemy soldiers, the APCs can be extremely useful for laying down a base of fire as the infantry advance without undue risk to the APC machine gunner. But in the same situation except with only five APCs, each vehicle will be a bullet magnet because they are the big, obvious, scary target with a powerful weapon manned by a relatively exposed soldier in an elevated and easy to target position. So you'd be better off letting the infantry provide the suppressive fire then.\n\nIt's a bit of a moot point going forward into the future, though, with remote weapons stations increasingly replacing manually fired coaxial MGs on at least western AFVs. Which is part of why the new Bradleys and other western vehicles will provide much more capable assault platforms. It's way easier to fire accurately and continuously when you're safely ensconced in a heavily armored vehicle.",

If anything, this news suggests the Russians are unable to defend the territory they have taken against the very same units that have been defending against the Russians during their winter offensives. Which in turn suggests those offensives were as misguided as most of us thought all along, and the Russians burned through not only their offensive potential but also compromised their ability to defend.

But there may be secondary motivations in many cases, such as establishing more defensible positions to reduce the burden of holding the line in certain areas while the offensive proceeds elsewhere, or capturing positions that will open up more options for follow-on offensives with the dedicated assault units. Targets of opportunity basically, just as you describe.\n\nBakhmut is interesting because holding it prevents the Russians from establishing a defensive line along the Siversky Donetsk Canal, while keeping open the possibility of attacking Soledar from three directions and continuing on toward Lysychansk to the north or reversing the famous \"Popasna flower\" to the east, or cutting the LNR off from the DNR by attacking along the M03.

You&#39;re just strengthening the point that this is nothing at all like Bakhamut.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>so if that&#39;s our definition then they&#39;re exactly the same because the area around Balakliia was also the site of low intensity skirmishing like what we&#39;ve seen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, completely false. The UA intentionally left Balaklia quiet, which is why the forces there were taken completely by surprise. Also why Russia had such scarce and low quality forces there.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t see a reason to continue the discussion, seems like when reality doesn&#39;t fit your narrative you just use your imagination and make things up.</p>\n</div>",

Most of PTI's key leaders now look to be under arrest. The government line is that Khan's arrest is a matter for the anti-corruption taskforce and the independent of the government and military, but that subsequent PTI leadership arrests are only because PTI is inciting premeditated violent unrest. \n\nFor my two cents, it's a bit chicken and egg - PTI's brand of populist nationalism does threaten the government and the stability and security of the state, it is clear why the state made the call to act to crush them before Khan and PTI tried to overthrow the government. But PTI certainly has a huge list of valid grievances and good reason to argue the illegitimacy of the current government's mandate (albeit their methods have been destructive and delusional, ie claiming the deep state colluded with the US and this is all a western conspiracy). \n\nThe military top brass' backing of the crackdown was almost a given but certainly is now with the deployment of the army to the streets. As a commentator yesterday mentioned, this is a dangerous time, Khan remains hugely popular, this crackdown is hugely divisive and may swell that further.

Of course, the instability has actually made it less likely the IMF will restart their loan program, so if that was the thought it backfired.\n\nStill, there's 320 T-80UDs they bought from Ukraine in their arsenal.

Suppressing doesn't necessarily require complete, permanent destruction of all enemy artillery, just forcing them to keep their heads down long enough to extend that 5-10 minute window out to however long it takes to concentrate, attack, and disperse again.\n\nI assume the Ukrainians have been reserving their own artillery ammo for this purpose based on info from Zaluzhny and others suggesting they have been husbanding resources for the offensive, which has contributed to the shortages on the front during the winter. The new assault corps also feature a pretty impressive number of Paladins and other western SPGs, which means they should be able to concentrate an enormous amount of highly accurate artillery that is reasonably resilient to enemy counterbattery fire very quickly. If they roll 60 Paladins into a few square kilometers, they will be able to fire more accurately, more quickly, and at greater range than anything the Russians have on the ground. The UAF shaping operations also seem to be focused on fuel storage, which will reduce the Russian's ability to quickly redeploy artillery to compensate for any comprehensive counterbattery campaign immediately prior to an assault.\n\nSo that just leaves the Russian missile forces, drones, and air force posing any threat to assault unit troop concentrations. I am frankly unsure how the Ukrainians will check these aerial threats, based on what information is in open source currently, but it seems likely they will concentrate their GBAD resources in the area of any attack. If the timing were convenient, I'd probably wait until just after a major Russian missile attack has depleted their short-term capacity to launch large scale PGM and drone attacks, because it seems they can't manage more than a monthly cadence for such attacks. That would free as much GBAD as possible to focus on denying access over the contested area of the front to the VKS planes armed with dumb bombs.",

So at a minimum, the Ukrainians could counterattack to reestablish the 2014 borders without facing fortifications any more substantial than what they will face anywhere else on the front. \n\nI think a lot of folks are conceptualizing the Ukrainian offensive as if it will be a single major push in one location toward one target. It's entirely possible, and maybe even more probable, that the Ukrainians will engage in a series of somewhat more limited offensives spread across the front. The Russians have demonstrated repeatedly that they struggle with multitasking because of their top-down command-and-control culture. Forcing them to respond to multiple attacks at once can overload the centralized commanders, which results in exploitable errors on the front. [That's how the US Army recommends fighting against Russian units, for example.](https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2017/spring/2Fiore17.pdf)\n\nSo we may see limited counteroffensives where there are opportunities to push the Russians back at least somewhat toward less favorable defensive lines. These attacks will be secondary efforts, not intended to achieve the Ukrainian strategic objectives in and of themselves, but meant to force the Russians out of position or to make difficult choices about where to prioritize resources.\n\nI suspect we may see such attacks targeting (in order from north to south along the front) the area northeast of Kupyansk, Svatove, Kreminna, the area on the right bank of the Siversky Donetsk west of Lysychansk, Lysychansk itself, Soledar/Krasna Hora, Popasna, Svitlodarsk, Verkhnotoretske (just north of Donetsk and the heart of the salient threatening Avdiivka from the north), Oleksandrivka (just south of Donetsk), or Volonovakha. So basically all the places that were viciously contested over the last 15 months as the Russians slowly ground forward in the east.\n\nIt would make sense to see more of these attacks concentrated near the center of the front rather than the flanks, because the Ukrainians will be able to make better use of their shorter interior lines of communication in the areas around Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, which have become heavily fortified supply hubs for the UAF in the Donbas. That would include everywhere from Kreminna south to the Russian salient north of Avdiivka. The Ukrainians should have an easier time concentrating forces for assaults there on short notice without necessarily signaling their exact target, giving the Russians the least amount of time possible to reinforce the targeted section of the front.

            "body": "> Could China realistically pressure Putin to give up Crimea? Macron seems to believe that there can be negotiations after a successful counteroffensive.\n\nI doubt anyone could pressure Putin to give up Crimea. IMHO the strengthening ties between the EU (especially France) and China are happening at the confluence of several things:\n\n1. The Anglo-American partnership, the UK's remarkably decisive involvement in the Ukraine war, and the way several Eastern European countries have managed to rise up and handle this remarkably well, despite all the politicking happening behind the scenes (see e.g. Poland) have cast the EU's geopolitical game in a rather bad light. So there are European leaders who need to step up their PR game to show they're still independent and capable of making bold foreign policy moves. Moving towards China is an attractive option for some politicians, like Macron, who have an American-skeptic audience to appeal to at home and who would like to avoid having too much weight shift East in the European landscape. (Thomas de Garets Geddes has some cool excerpts on [this](https://www.sinification.com/p/the-importance-of-france-and-macron), relevant for my third point below, too).\n\n2. There's some concern in China that the EU's strategic autonomy is waning, and that economic difficulties might pull the EU space further into the American orbit (the same Thomas des Garets Geddes,\nand Sophia Leonard Buisson quote an interesting analysis by Zhang Jian [here](https://www.sinification.com/p/the-future-of-the-eu-and-its-strategic?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1083330&post_id=105394844) - this isn't an official government document per se, so it's not necessarily the prevalent view in Beijing, but it's *a* view). So some rapprochement might actually calm some tits in Beijing, which isn't a completely bad thing in and of itself, given that the EU is just as dependent on China for its supply chain as the US but, between political & national greed and slow European institutions, they're generally in a worse position to do something about it.\n\n3. China, at the other end of the spectrum, has something big to be concerned about in this conflict. Their \"responsible superpower\" policy could lose all credibility if their close partner, Russia, goes nuclear (either by straight out lobing nuclear warheads or by doing something stupid at e.g. ZNPP). That would be really awful for China, but especially for Xi, as strong partnership with Russia was his pet project and one that wasn't especially well-received early on. Furthermore, China might end up going to war with one of the world's nuclear powers, so their attitude towards the use of nuclear weapons in this war might turn out to have consequences in a war that might be just around the corner. So they are *very* motivated to keep Putin's nuclear threats in check, but can't easily coordinate with the other major nuclear power in this game (the US). Macron is actually the ideal middleman in this case. He enjoys an excellent image in China (see my first link above for some samples), which is interesting in and of itself, as most European voters who are farther to the left and admire, or at least nominally don't dislike China, hate Macron for many of the reasons why the Chinese ideologists they admire so much love him. And the French audience is probably the only one in the EU that can swallow tighter partnership with China without much public shame, as they share some American skepticism, sympathy for some regimes and so on (I swear some jokes about French people being awful just write themselves).\n\n4. While the Russian government has been able to keep the economic consequences of international sanctions in check so far, their ability to do so is increasingly dependent on Chinese support. So as the war progresses, it's likely that China is going to have an increasingly bigger sway over Russia, which will remain in place even after the end of the war, to the point where finding some common ground with China will be useful for short- and medium-term security goals in Europe.\n\nIMHO the only short-term game currently being played is in terms of nuclear deterrence, some posturing by European leaders who are afraid to appear impotent, and some economic gains, rather than immediate influence over Russia's territorial demands. It's a little too early for anything else.\n\nChina may not necessarily be able to pressure Russia over something *specific* but they may be able to pressure them into entering negotiations sooner than they'd like, or entertaining terms they otherwise wouldn't entertain. Military concerns aside, the war hasn't been especially forgiving on Chinese economy - it's given them access to a rather modest market and helped them diversify their oil & gas sources to some degree, but the impact of strained consumption on their two largest foreign market has offset much, if not all of that - so China would probably like to see this war over sooner rather than later.",

The Vatican, but that&#39;s a bit of a silly example and it certainly wasn&#39;t neutral prior to the 19th century. I mean, a pope literally started the Crusades. Yugoslavia, although that started when it formed and ended when it broke up. Ireland, which was nominally not neutral when part of the UK, but that was compelled by a colonizing power and the Irish have been neutral since their independence and were at best reluctant participants in any pre-independence British wars.</p>\n</div>",

I.e. why have they escalated along their current trajectories thus far and no less or further? For example, people have speculated that the west has refrained from sending long range missiles or allowing Ukraine to strike Russian leaders because this, in turn, prevents China from providing direct military/ammunition aid to Russia.

But it's important that the risk be assessed and weighed against alternatives, instead of simply using the fact that a risk exists to end consideration of some course of action. Every thing that benefits a side is an escalation, and it's impossible to win a war without doing things that benefit your side.\n\nThe primary escalation that occurred during this war took place when Russia invaded Ukraine with pretty much their entire army, which escalated the war from sniping in the Donbass into a full-scale conventional war.\n\nGiven that Russia escalated to a full-scale war, question is how western actions, or Ukrainian actions, could further escalate the conflict.\n\nThe most significant way the conflict could escalate is by turning it into a nuclear conflict. That's one argument against providing Ukraine with long-range missiles, for example - Russia might mistake a conventional long-range missile headed into Russia for a nuclear first strike, and it could unintentionally turn the conflict nuclear. Another risk is that Ukraine, or the west, might defeat Russia too resoundingly. The idea is that if the Russian army were completely obliterated, Russia might assume an invasion of Russia was imminent and launch the nukes, so the safer option is to defeat the Russian army more slowly (or not defeat them entirely, by getting Russia keep part of the conquered territory or something of that sort.) I think that avoiding things like missiles flying into Russia is a good idea, but I don't think that the risk of nuclear war is sufficient to justify worry about exactly how to make Russia lose the war.\n\nAnother way the war could escalate is by drawing in Russian allies, like China or Iran, more than they are already drawn in. The theory here is that if the US gives Ukraine certain weapons then China, for example, will begin giving weapons directly to Russia. I don't really find this persuasive either - I think that China is avoiding giving Russia weapons because they don't want to suffer the economic fallout of Europe sanctioning them, and I don't think that Ukraine getting weapons is likely to change that. But who knows. This is the sort of escalation that is more tolerable to take risks with though, because the stakes are much lower than with nukes.\n\nThe last way that I think the war could escalate is if Russia became more invested in the war. Russia could win the war any time it wanted to, but Russia as a population generally speaking doesn't want to fight this war, and instead wants it to go away. Only the Russian elite are invested in this war, and not even all of them. I think that things like invading Russia or blowing up population centers in Russia would risk escalating the war by making Russians actually look at this war like a war for national survival, instead of the inconvenience that it currently is for them. I think that this risk is more likely than either of the other two, and serious enough that avoiding this particular type of escalation should be, and I'm sure is, one of the primary goals of Ukraine and the west.\n\nEdit: I want to add that there are other risks that in my opinion, at least, are behind much of the reluctance to provide certain weapons to Ukraine, such as the risk that Russia get their hands on technology.

That's the problem with trying to wage a war that most of the people in your country wish you weren't involved in. (The bright side for Putin is that the average Russian exists in a state of learned helplessness, so they aren't likely to start a revolution anytime soon, but apathetically sitting there doesn't win wars either.) \n\nContrast this with the Ukrainian people. They have excellent motivation to fight and everything I've seen suggests they are highly motivated. On the one hand they have cultural memories of Russian atrocities and mismanagement during Soviet times. On the other hand they felt enough kinship with the Russian people to feel betrayed by this invasion. Russians can't stop committing sickening war crimes, which means that they know exactly what to expect if the Russians succeed. They're fully committed and motivated.\n\nPresumably none of that is going to change for the foreseeable future.

(The bright side for Putin is that the average Russian exists in a state of learned helplessness, so they aren&#39;t likely to start a revolution anytime soon, but apathetically sitting there doesn&#39;t win wars either.) </p>\n\n<p>Contrast this with the Ukrainian people. They have excellent motivation to fight and everything I&#39;ve seen suggests they are highly motivated. On the one hand they have cultural memories of Russian atrocities and mismanagement during Soviet times. On the other hand they felt enough kinship with the Russian people to feel betrayed by this invasion. Russians can&#39;t stop committing sickening war crimes, which means that they know exactly what to expect if the Russians succeed. They&#39;re fully committed and motivated.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably none of that is going to change for the foreseeable future. But if, for some reason, the Russian people did decide that this was a war worth fighting, that would be and awful development for Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",
