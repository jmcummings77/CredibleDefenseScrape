        "body": "New update about the tactical situation of the front in Ukraine and on the events of the last month. Today I will comment on the sectors from Kupyansk to Horlivka, and tomorrow on those from Avdiivka to the Dnipro River. As usual, my main sources are the Ukrainian military observators Mashovets and Kovalenko, several Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels (e.g. WarArchive for geolocations) and of course DeepState. I suggest having a map under eye while reading, for instance DeepState or Andrew Perpetua's. Another map I recommend is that of Motopatriot (you can find him on Telegram), who is a Russian and pro-Russia but his map is usually reliable (with a few exceptions, his lines almost entirely reflect my understanding of the tactical situation in the various sectors); it's very useful especially for locating Ukrainian trenches and strongpoints, which are mapped thanks to satellite images or to videos by drones being posted.\n\nKupyansk sector. The 6th Army (= CAA) of the Leningrad Military District, with its 25th and 138th Motorized Brigades supported by several regiments of the Territorial Forces (344th, 350th, 352nd, 1843rd), continued its attack operations towards Synkivka, but there were very few successes. In January they had advanced 4/500 meters into the forest south of Lyman Pershyi, aiming to flank Synkivka from the north-west: the Ukrainian positions in the forest west of the village are very important for holding the former; nevertheless, no significant new advances have been recorded. At the moment the Russians, as I understand it, control the first two streets in the northern end of Synkivka, but from there they have not been capable of further progress. They are also trying to advance along the forest belt to the north-east of the village to approach it from that side. Recently the 1st Mechanized Battalion of the Ukrainian 30th Mech Brigade should have arrived in the area, thus joining the 2nd Mech Battalion of the same brigade in defending the village. The Ukrainian grouping around Kupyansk is very large and strong (I will not list every unit defending the area) and I believe it\u2019s one of the few areas where the Ukrainians have numerical superiority. Moreover, the (small) 6th CAA is, in my opinion, the worst performing army of the Russian Armed Forces, both now and during the course of the war, although Russian sources state that the commanders of the very costly and unsuccessful attacks against Synkivka of December have been relieved.\n\nThe intensity and the number of directions from which the Russians are attacking has reduced significantly since the last part of 2023. In particular, the Russians attack sporadically and with little effort from Pershotravneve (where the 96th Reconnaissance Brigade of the 1st GTA was spotted), although Mashovets warned that they may become more active from this direction in the future. A few days ago the 3rd Mech Battalion of the 54th Mech Brigade (which confirmed that elements of this brigade are still in the sector!) repelled a Russian attack along a forest belt to the north-west of Orlyanka, preventing the Russians from reaching Height 195, an important Ukrainian position in the area.\n\nThe most interesting thing in this sector is that the Ukrainians were able to contain the Russian breakthrough in the Tabaikva/Krokhmalne direction which was carried out in January. The 103rd TDF Brigade and some reinforcements which arrived recently - the 1st Assault Battalion of the 67th Mech Brigade (which lost a couple of companies and the name \"Da Vinci's Wolves\", that joined a new battalion within the 59th Motorized Brigade) and elements of the 1st Special Purpose Brigade \"Ivan Bohun\" - were able to retake a few hundred meters near Tabaivka, preventing the Russians from crossing the Pischana River. Today the (very small) village is a gray area. At the same time the Russians, whose units involved in the area are mainly the 1st Tank Regiment and the 15th Motorized Regiment of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st Tank Army (= GTA) of the Moscow Military District, have been unable to break through the Ukrainian trenches along the P07 Road and to approach the heights around Kotlyarivka and Kyslivka. To support the Russian actions towards these two villages, the 7th Separate Motorized Regiment of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet (although today, in theory, it should formally belong to the Leningrad MD, following the recent Russian reform) is attacking from Yahidne towards Ivanivka, but again, without success. Just to the south of the area affected by the breakthrough in January, the Russians still report the presence of elements of the Ukrainian 25th Airborne Brigade, a sign that not all of the brigade was moved to Avdiivka. \n\nSvatove sector. Nothing relevant to say. Last week some Russian Telegram channels totally randomly claimed that they had captured Makiivka, but as far as I understand there is no Russian progress towards this village after the advances during January. \n\nKreminna sector. The Ukrainians have all in all stabilized the situation between Terny and Yampolivka so far, after the Russians had managed to advance 6 kms towards the Zherebets River between early December and early February. Russian advances in the forested ravine that the Russians call \"Alligator\" (the largest of those descending towards Terny) were halted (with the Russians holding about slightly more than the half of the ravine), while in the ravine south of the former (\"Mitten\"), the Russians were never able to occupy positions. Russian sources complain of very stiff Ukrainian resistance and these areas being heavily mined. The 144th Motorized Division of the 20th CAA of the Moscow MD (i.e. the formation that had achieved the advances of December/January, particularly with its 283rd and 488th Motorized Regiments) suffered significant human and material losses. Dozens of armored vehicles were lost in the area, and from the Russian channel \"Poisk in UA\" I read that a woman searching for a MIA relative of hers (a serviceman of the 283rd Motorized Regiment) complained that there would be 20 men left in his company from the initial 120.\n\nThe Ukrainians have a relevant grouping in the area: near Terny, the 21st Mech Brigade, the 97th Mech Battalion of the 60th Mech Brigade, the 18th \"Sloviansk\" Brigade of the National Guard; while the 3rd Battalion of the 25th Airborne Brigade, transferred from here to Avdiivka in February, has been replaced by at least a battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade\u2026 the \"firefighters\" of the north-western front. A few days ago, I saw from a video released by them that the UAV unit of the \"Azov\" Brigade of the National Guard was active in this area, although I don\u2019t know whether maneuver elements of this brigade were relocated here from the Serebrianka Forest. The area near Yampolivka, just to the south (towards which the 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA of the Central MD is active), is defended by the 63rd Mech Brigade, elements of the 4th Tank Brigade and some TDF battalions. Ukrainian sources report that lately the intensity of fighting has decreased and a rotation in the Russian side is underway. Elements of the 31st and 37th Motorized Regiments of the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th CAA, supported by elements of the 19th Tank Regiment of the same division, have entered action towards Terny.\n\nSome assault companies of the 752nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division of the 20th CAA of the MMD have been transferred to the area (from the area around Makiivka) in support of the 144th Motorized Division. As the Group of Forces \"West\" has gained jurisdiction over at least the area down to Yampolivka, elements of the 1st GTA are also being transferred to the Kreminna sector from Kupyansk. A battalion of the 2nd Motorized Division and another one of the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA are going to be transferred to the subordination of the 144th Motorized Division. In addition, elements of the 153rd Tank Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA are arriving in Kreminna and Rubizhne, together with the 744th Artillery Regiment of the same division and the 347th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, to make up for the complete withdrawal from the Kreminna sector of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD and the 348th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, which were transferred to Avdiivka. Therefore, the situation is still far from being completely stabilized. \n\nThe 169th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA continues, unsuccessfully, to push towards Dibrova. At the moment the Russian units active in the eastern part of the Serebrianka Forest are the 137th Motorized Brigade (per Mashovets is part of the 41st CAA of the CMD) and elements of the 201st Military Base of the CMD, along with some BARS detachments. Against them there is the \"Azov\" Brigade, supported by elements of the \"Bureviy\" and \"Khartiia\" Brigades of the National Guard. It seems that in February the \"Azov\" Brigade was able to gain a few hundred meters to the east, in the context of the broad fluidity of the lines inside the forest. Last part below.",

Dozens of armored vehicles were lost in the area, and from the Russian channel &quot;Poisk in UA&quot; I read that a woman searching for a MIA relative of hers (a serviceman of the 283rd Motorized Regiment) complained that there would be 20 men left in his company from the initial 120.</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians have a relevant grouping in the area: near Terny, the 21st Mech Brigade, the 97th Mech Battalion of the 60th Mech Brigade, the 18th &quot;Sloviansk&quot; Brigade of the National Guard; while the 3rd Battalion of the 25th Airborne Brigade, transferred from here to Avdiivka in February, has been replaced by at least a battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade\u2026 the &quot;firefighters&quot; of the north-western front. A few days ago, I saw from a video released by them that the UAV unit of the &quot;Azov&quot; Brigade of the National Guard was active in this area, although I don\u2019t know whether maneuver elements of this brigade were relocated here from the Serebrianka Forest. The area near Yampolivka, just to the south (towards which the 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA of the Central MD is active), is defended by the 63rd Mech Brigade, elements of the 4th Tank Brigade and some TDF battalions. Ukrainian sources report that lately the intensity of fighting has decreased and a rotation in the Russian side is underway. Elements of the 31st and 37th Motorized Regiments of the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th CAA, supported by elements of the 19th Tank Regiment of the same division, have entered action towards Terny.</p>\n\n<p>Some assault companies of the 752nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division of the 20th CAA of the MMD have been transferred to the area (from the area around Makiivka) in support of the 144th Motorized Division. As the Group of Forces &quot;West&quot; has gained jurisdiction over at least the area down to Yampolivka, elements of the 1st GTA are also being transferred to the Kreminna sector from Kupyansk. A battalion of the 2nd Motorized Division and another one of the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA are going to be transferred to the subordination of the 144th Motorized Division. In addition, elements of the 153rd Tank Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA are arriving in Kreminna and Rubizhne, together with the 744th Artillery Regiment of the same division and the 347th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, to make up for the complete withdrawal from the Kreminna sector of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD and the 348th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, which were transferred to Avdiivka. Therefore, the situation is still far from being completely stabilized. </p>\n\n<p>The 169th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA continues, unsuccessfully, to push towards Dibrova. At the moment the Russian units active in the eastern part of the Serebrianka Forest are the 137th Motorized Brigade (per Mashovets is part of the 41st CAA of the CMD) and elements of the 201st Military Base of the CMD, along with some BARS detachments. Against them there is the &quot;Azov&quot; Brigade, supported by elements of the &quot;Bureviy&quot; and &quot;Khartiia&quot; Brigades of the National Guard. It seems that in February the &quot;Azov&quot; Brigade was able to gain a few hundred meters to the east, in the context of the broad fluidity of the lines inside the forest.

            "body": "Siversk sector. Bilohorivka (the one in Luhansk Oblast) continues to be heavily attacked by the Russians, specifically by the 127th Motorized Brigade (per some Russian sources it\u2019s known as the 7th) of the 2nd Corps of the 8th CAA of the Southern MD. The Ukrainian 81st Airmobile Brigade is putting up very determined and capable resistance to Russian efforts there. From the chalk processing plant, the Russians had managed to advance a few hundred meters along the industrial area towards the center of the village, around one month ago, but they appear to have been stopped and were unable to drive the Ukrainians from their positions inside the chalk quarry. The 6th Motorized Brigade (which was likely reformed; it was the former 6th Motorized Regiment) of the 2nd Corps, along with elements of the 88th Motorized Brigade of the same corps, tried to advance into the area between Verkhnokamyanske and Spirne, but to no avail, thanks to defense opposed by the \"Rubizh\" Brigade of the National Guard and elements of the 54th Mech Brigade. \n\nThe 123rd Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps and the 51st and 119th Air Assault Regiments of the 106th VDV Division continued to push from the area near Vesele in the direction of Vyimka. By mid-February they had succeeded in advancing about 600 meters along the Siversk-Nyrkove railway, but since then no further progress has been made, either along this railroad or towards the heights north of Vesele, where in both cases there are several Ukrainian fortifications defended by the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade. Vesele is largely a gray area and the Russians have been unable to cross the Sukha Plotva River.\n\nThe 137th Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division and elements of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps are active in the area between Vasyukivka and Rozdolivka but no progress is being made, thanks to the defense by elements of the 30th Mech Brigade and of the 241st TDF Brigade. \n\nBakhmut sector. Northern flank. Here there is the most critical situation for the Ukrainians. The 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet (in theory, this, too, should now be part of the LMD), along with the \"Sever-V\" Brigade of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps, continues to push towards Bohdanivka, managing to record some slight advances within the village (of which they control about one third) and in the heights to its north-west. The village is defended by the 56th Motorized Brigade, a battalion each of the 93rd and 24th Mech Brigades, elements of the \"Lyut\" Brigade of the National Police and elements of the TDF. \n\nIn mid-February, the Russians (after some Ukrainian counterattacks that had stabilized the situation in January), specifically the 98th VDV Division, were able to advance both along the Bakhmut - Chasiv Yar railway and from the Khromove cemetery, capturing the important Ukrainian trenches system located on either side of the railway. The area is defended by the 42nd Mech Brigade, the 214th Special Battalion OPFOR, the 21st and 23rd Special Purpose Battalions of the Separate Presidential Brigade and the 114th TDF Brigade. The Russians thus advanced 7/800 meters into the heights south-east of Bohdanivka in the direction of Chasiv Yar (occupying the Popov Forest and coming within 2 kms of the private sector of Chasiv Yar, in the part of the town to the east of the Donets-Donbas Canal) and in particularly (thanks also to the work of other units), managed to get Ivanivske into trouble, advancing about 2 kms from Khromove towards it. The 98th VDV Division is fully committed in the offensive. Among its three air assault regiments, the 217th is active in the direction of Bohdanivka, the 299th in the direction of Chasiv Yar and the 331st in the direction of Ivanivske. Moreover, around mid-February elements of the 150th Motorized Division (its 102nd Motorized Regiment and 68th Tank Regiment) of the 8th CAA were brought into the battle in the direction of Ivanivske from the Bakhmut dachas area, managing to advance about 1 km and occupy the first houses of the village, forcing the Ukrainians to abandon the positions in the fields to the north-east of Ivanivske, wedged between the two Russian attack axes. They are being assisted from the east by the 11th VDV Brigade and the \"Kamerton\" unit of the \"Akhmat Special Forces\". Ivanivske is likely defended by one battalion each from the 92nd Assault Brigade and the 93rd Mech Brigade, the 17th Tank Brigade and elements of the TDF. \n\nBetween late February and early March, the Russians were able to make important and rapid advances within the village (which the Russians never managed to occupy at the time of the battle of Bakhmut). At the moment, as far as I understand, they occupy about half the village, including all of the part north of the T0504 Road. It\u2019s unclear whether the Ukrainians will be able to stabilize the situation while avoiding the loss of the village. In such a case, the Russians would be about 1,5 km from the Donets-Donbas Canal and could approach Chasiv Yar from the south-east (let\u2019s recall that this town is constantly being hit by Russian aviation and artillery), and it would also significantly worsen the situation for the Ukrainians near Klishchiivka. \n\nSouthern flank of Bakhmut. Tough battles continue in the area around Klishchiivka, but the Russians are still unable to make any headway. About half of the extensive system of fortifications north-west of the village, which includes the well-known Height 215 (which the Russians call the \"Bald Mountain\"), remains in Ukrainian hands. The Russians very often launch assaults in this area, which are repulsed, with significant losses on both sides. \n\nKlishchiivka is defended by the bulk of the 93rd Mech Brigade, the 5th Assault Brigade, the 22nd Mech Brigade, elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade and elements of the TDF. The bulk of the 92nd Assault Brigade is active in Andriivka, just to the south. Attacking from the east, the Russians are unable to make any progress towards these two villages and the Ukrainians even continue to hold the area of the ponds, east of the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway, between Klishchiivka and Andriivka.\n\nAs for the Russians, there are several motorized brigades of the 2nd Corps (4th, 85th and elements of the 88th) and the 3rd Corps in the area. I believe the latter formation is now deployed entirely in the southern flank of Bakhmut, although it should be small overall. It includes the 72nd Motorized Brigade, the 6th Motorized Division and the 17th High Power Artillery Brigade, all deployed in the area. The 6th Motorized Division was never fully completed. It was originally supposed to include three motorized regiments (54th, 55th and 57th) and the 10th Tank Regiment. The latter regiment has recently been transferred to the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA; the 57th Motorized Regiment according to Ukrainian sources is supposed to be in Avdiivka but there have been no updates about it for months; while the 54th and the 55th probably don\u2019t exist (they were said to be being trained in Belarus, but I found instances of people who had signed contracts with them and then were sent to units of the 2nd Corps). According to Mashovets, the 6th Motorized Division today includes the 1008th, 1194th and 1307th Regiments of the Territorial Forces. \n\nThe area around Klishchiivka is attacked by elements of the 2nd Corps and by the 1008th and 1307th Regiments (along with, probably, the 1428th Regiment of the Territorial Forces) as well as \"Akhmat\" detachments, while the 72nd Motorized Brigade along with the 1194th Regiment are active towards Andriivka. The 83rd VDV Brigade is also in the area. Kurdyumivka is home to the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment of the Caspian Flotilla and elements of the 7th Military Base of the 49th CAA of the SMD, which have not made any progress towards Ukrainian positions, held by the 28th Mech Brigade and by elements of the \"Pomsta\" Brigade of the Border Guards (part of the Offensive Guard).\n\nMashovets urges attention to one thing: if the Russians by chance ever succeed in breaking through the Donets-Donbas Canal from the southern flank of Bakhmut and in advancing to the north along the H20 from Avdiivka, they could begin building an advance along the flanks of Toretsk, with the goal of putting the city inside a salient. Toretsk may in fact be a long-term Russian target. \n\nHorlivka sector. Nothing to say. \n\nSee you tomorrow (I hope) for the rest of the front line!",

I expect Russia to try something in the Baltics if given an opportunity and I do think that this will still come as a major surprise to our NATO allies, I also think that Russia will have it much harder against us than most people (including Russia and our NATO allies) expect.\n\nI think Russia will not be able to overrun the Baltic armies. Russia will be capable of presenting so many simultaneous problems that they can occupy and fortify certain regions in the Baltics.

            "body": "As someone who has spent considerable (in hindsight: disgusting) amounts of time trawling satellite imagery of Russian airfields and ARZ's in particular, cataloguing for airframes, whilst this \\*might\\* be indicative of losses the actual evidence is extremely slim and should only be taken as a sign that airframes are potentially moving around.\n\nAll this demonstrates is that at the time the snapshot was taken, the airframes weren't present/visible. It doesn't explain where those airframes went or even show the maximal number of airframes actually present at those respective airfields. It merely shows an extremely limited snapshot of what was visible at that specific moment, irrespective of missions, training, repair or any other activities that would remove them from the image.\n\nThe article and the telegram source take some liberties with describing these which I don't think are appropriate given the relative unreliability of this type of satellite imagery and as someone else already noted, they weren't particularly accurate in the past (although that shouldn't really have much of an impact on the satellite images, merely their analysis of them).\n\nThe problem with Satellite Imagery is that it only takes a snapshot at an extremely specific time and airbases in particular are operational by nature, especially in the middle of a war. If an aircraft is landing, covered or even taxiing at the time and doesn't get exposed properly, it will be missed. If the aircraft is off re-arming at a separate field or using the maintenance facilities of a separate field, it will be missed. If the aircraft is placed at a dispersal field for a few days, and those happen to be days where satellite imagery was taken of a specific set of airfields, then that can also cause false positives.\n\nI generally have a problem with people trying to draw conclusions from airbase satellite imagery mostly because I've spent a great deal of time steeped in this so to be entirely fair my bar might be higher than is actually reasonable, I also recognize that many of these OSINT sources have to fund the satellite imagery themselves which is no small feat and have access to more limited sets, so to some extent there are challenges outside of analysis which can prove difficult to overcome.\n\nThat being said, you need to have a large enough data set and other sources to prove/disprove regiment movements, specific airframe movements, operational tempo etc, that can all add to a more general conclusion, but realistically speaking a handful of spaced snapshots of airfields over a relatively short timeframe just doesn't provide enough evidence and leaves things far too susceptible to false positives and other challenges that come with aircraft in particular.\n\nThere are a few other more general issues, for a start it's extremely difficult to attribute specific airframes to satellite imagery. The Su-34 you spot at Morozovsk for example could be the exact same Su-34 you spot days later at Khanskaya or Primorsk etc. The aircraft you also spot \\*missing\\* from Morozovsk could also be enroute at the time to one of those two locations. There's not enough data here to prove an airframe loss.\n\nWhilst there are some upsides, notably Russian airbases mostly don't have specific covered structures or HAS's for the more modern aircraft and for the Su-34 in particular (the only airbase which houses a Su-34 regiment with covered structures is Khurba (Komsomolsk-on-Amur) and this makes identifying them easier, especially with the colour and minor structural differences) the challenge is that the aircraft still frequently rotate location based on their operational needs, sometimes several times a day between the main apron, repair and then the revetments. Drawing any conclusions based on the specific location of airframes is premature especially when several days have passed between the satellite imagery in some of these cases.\n\nAnother issue is that satellite imagery doesn't take into account repair. Russian airbases typically have repair and maintenance facilities that are on the smaller side. In the past this was fine when operational tempo pre-war was extremely low, but during the war they've already demonstrated a willingness to move airframes temporarily back to interior locations, ARZ's and manufacturers to speed up the process given the limited internal space at many of these forward workshops and the necessity to avoid maintenance impacting operational availability. Given enough satellite imagery over a significant amount of time, you could rule this out or at least quantify it to some extent, but limited data makes drawing conclusions pointless.\n\nThere's also a few inaccuracies, they state that prior to the war Krymsk did not have Su-34's, they did. There has frequently been rotational Su-34's that land there for several weeks, sometimes months at a time even before the war. Just because an airbase doesn't have a specific regiment attached doesn't mean that airframes aren't frequently based there. Khanskaya for example is a perfect example of that, there is no official attachment of composite or BAP, and yet it's currently being used as a hodgepodge dispersal and relief field for several types of fighter bombers. This was also the case for several training regiment fields pre-war for both Su-34's and Su-24M's. Russia has a habit of moving its airframes around for training, deployment and dispersal purposes.\n\nAlso they mention Primorsko-Akhtarsk, stating that there shouldn't be any Su-34s there which is a bit puzzling. The 559th frequently uses Primorsko as an operational field for both dispersal and operations from the Sea of Azov. There have been several instances where the number of aircraft increased or decreased but for the most part it has consistently been used by the 559th throughout the war.\n\nIt's not bad to use the satellite imagery to infer that there are potentially losses, so long as there is enough data to support that analysis, and in this case two side by sides with various overlap and non-overlap with other targeted fields and several days gap between images doesn't really do much to prove or disprove anything other than that aircraft are clearly not currently present.\n\nOn the note of the fiber optic links, thank you for sharing! I had no idea this was even being considered as an EW workaround but it's actually extremely interesting and maybe indicates the direction that EW resistant drones are going to have to take in the future.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>As someone who has spent considerable (in hindsight: disgusting) amounts of time trawling satellite imagery of Russian airfields and ARZ&#39;s in particular, cataloguing for airframes, whilst this *might* be indicative of losses the actual evidence is extremely slim and should only be taken as a sign that airframes are potentially moving around.</p>\n\n<p>All this demonstrates is that at the time the snapshot was taken, the airframes weren&#39;t present/visible. It doesn&#39;t explain where those airframes went or even show the maximal number of airframes actually present at those respective airfields.

There&#39;s nothing preventing a 7.62mm machine gun on a remote weapons station from shooting down an FPV drone if you&#39;re ok with intercepting it at only a couple hundred meters distance. Cost of engagement and hardware costs would be very low, the main technical difficulty is the reliable detection of the drone by the onboard sensors, which is mostly a software challenge.

        "body": "Well, Andrew Perpetua tweeted about this so I suppose its relevant enough to share. NYT publishes another inner look at US/Ukraine relations. The only interesting tidbit is that Zaluzhny was on US's side during the planning of the 2023 counteroffensive.\n\n[Mutual Frustrations Arise in U.S.-Ukraine Alliance](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/politics/ukraine-us-military-frustrations.html)\n\n>More than two years into their wartime alliance, the bond between the United States and Ukraine is showing signs of wear and tear, giving way to mutual frustration and a feeling that the relationship might be stuck in a bit of a rut.\n\n>For the Pentagon, the exasperation comes down to a single, recurring issue: American military strategists, including Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, believe that Ukraine needs to concentrate its forces on one big fight at a time. Instead, President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has vowed to drive Russia out of every inch of Ukraine, expends his forces in battles for towns that U.S. officials say lack strategic value.\n\n>For its part, Ukraine is increasingly disheartened that American political paralysis has resulted in shortages of ammunition for troops on the front. As each day goes by without a fresh supply of munitions and artillery, and Ukrainian crews ration the shells they have, morale is suffering.\n\n...\n\n>Some officials say General Syrsky may be more in sync with Mr. Zelensky than his predecessor.\n\n>Two other officials, however, worried whether the new military chief would be willing to push his boss in a direction he did not want to go.\n\n>Neither the Americans nor the Ukrainians are heading for exit doors. Their commitment remains solid, as each side needs the other. The U.S. intelligence community still provides a substantial amount of real-time information to Ukraine\u2019s military on Russian command posts, ammunition depots and other key nodes in Russian military lines. The Pentagon still hosts monthly Contact Group meetings to prod Ukraine\u2019s partners to provide money, weapons and ammunition.\n\n>\u201cAt the end of the day, make no mistake: Even those generals who might be frustrated with Ukraine are at the same time looking at the Russian casualties reports and equipment losses and they\u2019re smiling,\u201d said Dale Buckner, a former Army colonel who is the chief executive of Global Guardian, a U.S.-based security firm.\n\n...\n\n>The disagreement over Avdiivka was a mirror image in reverse of Washington\u2019s frustrations with the Ukrainian counteroffensive last summer. In that case, Mr. Austin and other American officials urged Ukraine to focus its assault on one main effort along the 600-mile front line and press to break through Russian fortifications there.\n\n>U.S. officials believed that General Zaluzhny had agreed with the American advice but that he could not convince his president. So instead of a single defining fight, Kyiv split up its troops, sending some to the east and some to other fronts, including in the south.\n\n...\n\n>Pentagon officials are still giving advice on the military campaign they would like to see in 2024. Three U.S. military officials said in interviews that the United States wanted Ukraine to concentrate long-range strikes on \u201cputting Crimea at risk,\u201d a phrase that translates into attacking the Russian \u201cland bridge\u201d that traverses southern Ukraine and connects Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which President Vladimir V. Putin seized in 2014.",

The only interesting tidbit is that Zaluzhny was on US&#39;s side during the planning of the 2023 counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/us/politics/ukraine-us-military-frustrations.html\">Mutual Frustrations Arise in U.S.-Ukraine Alliance</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>More than two years into their wartime alliance, the bond between the United States and Ukraine is showing signs of wear and tear, giving way to mutual frustration and a feeling that the relationship might be stuck in a bit of a rut.</p>\n\n<p>For the Pentagon, the exasperation comes down to a single, recurring issue: American military strategists, including Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, believe that Ukraine needs to concentrate its forces on one big fight at a time. Instead, President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has vowed to drive Russia out of every inch of Ukraine, expends his forces in battles for towns that U.S. officials say lack strategic value.</p>\n\n<p>For its part, Ukraine is increasingly disheartened that American political paralysis has resulted in shortages of ammunition for troops on the front. As each day goes by without a fresh supply of munitions and artillery, and Ukrainian crews ration the shells they have, morale is suffering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some officials say General Syrsky may be more in sync with Mr. Zelensky than his predecessor.</p>\n\n<p>Two other officials, however, worried whether the new military chief would be willing to push his boss in a direction he did not want to go.</p>\n\n<p>Neither the Americans nor the Ukrainians are heading for exit doors. Their commitment remains solid, as each side needs the other. The U.S. intelligence community still provides a substantial amount of real-time information to Ukraine\u2019s military on Russian command posts, ammunition depots and other key nodes in Russian military lines. The Pentagon still hosts monthly Contact Group meetings to prod Ukraine\u2019s partners to provide money, weapons and ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day, make no mistake: Even those generals who might be frustrated with Ukraine are at the same time looking at the Russian casualties reports and equipment losses and they\u2019re smiling,\u201d said Dale Buckner, a former Army colonel who is the chief executive of Global Guardian, a U.S.-based security firm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The disagreement over Avdiivka was a mirror image in reverse of Washington\u2019s frustrations with the Ukrainian counteroffensive last summer. In that case, Mr. Austin and other American officials urged Ukraine to focus its assault on one main effort along the 600-mile front line and press to break through Russian fortifications there.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials believed that General Zaluzhny had agreed with the American advice but that he could not convince his president. So instead of a single defining fight, Kyiv split up its troops, sending some to the east and some to other fronts, including in the south.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pentagon officials are still giving advice on the military campaign they would like to see in 2024. Three U.S. military officials said in interviews that the United States wanted Ukraine to concentrate long-range strikes on \u201cputting Crimea at risk,\u201d a phrase that translates into attacking the Russian \u201cland bridge\u201d that traverses southern Ukraine and connects Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which President Vladimir V. Putin seized in 2014.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

So instead of a single defining fight, Kyiv split up its troops, sending some to the east and some to other fronts, including in the south.\n\nThis is interesting. \n\n[The Dec 4, 2023 WaPo article describing planning issues of the counteroffensive says otherwise](https://archive.is/otBGS) \n\n>Ukrainian officials argued that they needed to sustain a robust fight in the Bakhmut area because otherwise Russia would try to reoccupy parts of the Kharkiv region and advance in Donetsk \u2014 a key objective for Putin, who wants to seize that whole region.  \n>  \n>\u201cWe told \\[the Americans\\], \u2018If you assumed the seats of our generals, you\u2019d see that if we don\u2019t make Bakhmut a point of contention, \\[the Russians\\] would,\u2019\u201d one senior Ukrainian official said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d  \n>  \n>In addition, Zaluzhny envisioned making the formidable length of the 600-mile front a problem for Russia, according to the senior British official. The Ukrainian general wanted to stretch Russia\u2019s much larger occupying force \u2014 unfamiliar with the terrain and already facing challenges with morale and logistics \u2014 to dilute its fighting power.  \n>  \n>Western officials saw problems with that approach, which would also diminish the firepower of Ukraine\u2019s military at any single point of attack. Western military doctrine dictated a concentrated push toward a single objective.  \n>  \n>The Americans yielded, however.\n\nThat article credits Zaluzhny specifically with the broad front strategy, with two sources (one UA and one British) saying that he wanted to stretch the Russians thin. But now it's Zelensky's fault? \n\nI'm not so sure. Zelensky might have insisted on retaking Bakhmut and holding Kupyansk, which would necessitate concentrating forces under Syrsky's Operational-Strategic Grouping of Forces Khortytsia, but that doesn't explain the diffused effort in   Tarnavskyi's Operational-Strategic Grouping of Forces Tavria, who had two full corps at his disposal, plus Air Assault Forces in reserve, but committed them piecemeal in two separate operational axes that weren't mutually supportive. \n\nThe only logical reason to do that, minus stupidity or treason, is 1) The assumption that the Russians are too weak to stop even a piecemeal assault force from breaking through, so they can leave most of the offensive forces aside as reserves 2) A desire for the Velyka Novosilka axis attack, starting four days before the Robotyne thrust, would cause the Russians to commit operational reserves there, which is exactly what the WaPo article also says Zaluzhny was planning in the East too (as well as the raid into Belgorod). \n\nEither way, whether it was Zaluzhny or Zelensky, somebody at the top screwed up.",

Just shy of half a year of grinding away in very costly attacks, using up manpower and ammo they had no assurances they could replace (and couldn&#39;t), and in the end they had almost nothing to show for it other than a few villages and talk of causing severe Russian losses. </p>\n\n<p>That were so severe that Russia was immediately able to launch a major counter counteroffensive that&#39;s been ongoing for 6 months, which has been as bloody for the Russians as any stage of this war or worse.  </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, I don&#39;t think the UAF decision to disperse forces worked out better...</p>\n</div>",

There is literally a dedicated Wikipedia article for the [Haitian crisis (2018\u2013present)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_crisis_(2018%E2%80%93present\\)). It culminated in the assassination of the president in 2021, the true perpetrators of which have never been found. Whatever was spent on security and democratisation didn't suffice this time, either. \n\nThe twenty year, multi-trillion dollar operation in Afghanistan ended with the last Allied planes taking off in Kabul after the Taliban had overrun the democratic government and installed themselves in power. Whatever was spent on security and democratisation didn't suffice this time, either, and it must have been a lot more.\n\nIt's neat that someone at Rand estimated in 2007 that democratisation costs ten dollars per capita and year.

The practical solution is for the aid to be delivered through Israel, as it has always been, the primary limitation on that is that Israel has been preventing almost all aid from going through for many months. Given reports that Biden has approved over 100 weapons sales to Israel since the conflict started, without Congressional input, and given that the US has continued to be the one country backing Israel down the line at the UN, he has a lot of leverage if he wanted to use it. But doing so would outrage pro-Israel lobbyists and the pro-Israel portion of his own party. At the same time he is under increasing pressure from the pro-Palestinian portion of his party to take decisive action to protect the starving civilians, particularly with reports that Israel has been shooting them while they try to access aid.\n\nThis plan is an attempt to thread that political needle. It is a plausible way to provide large amounts of food to starving Palestinians, unlike the air drops, and it is almost impossible to use it to accuse Biden of being disloyal to Israel. It does, to an extent, interpose the American military directly between the Israeli military and those aid shipments (remember that Israel has a long history of shooting Palestinians in those waters), and any result of that gives Biden more maneuvering room, whether the aid goes through or Israel opens fire on the US for violating their blockade. It is absolutely not entirely practical. But it does have some chance of working, which is better than none.\n\nEdit: I was curious about some napkin math on airdrops and the need, just using Wikipedia numbers. The standard calorie requirement is 2000, divide that by 4 calories per gram of protein or carbohydrate and you get 500 grams per person per day. That's assuming no packaging, water weight, etc. 2.3 million people living there, so 1.15 million kg per day. A C-130 can carry up to 19,000 kg. So you get 61 C-130 flights per day, in a heavily idealized scenario. The USAF has 273 C-130J's in total. This would be a massive effort. A single Panamax cargo ship can carry up to 52.5 million kg of cargo.",

The WFP usually drops sacks of staples like rice, flour, or beans, packaged into 20-50kg sacks with multiple bags to contain any spillage from the inner sack bursting on impact, from around 100m. For three reasons. First, a single container drop can be seized by one party who can then control distribution of the aid, potentially empowering nefarious parties to exercise control over the local population. A large number of sacks spread across a large area defrays this risk. Second, because of the danger that a single, large container will land on top of someone, as happened in this case. Even if the chute opens, the container poses a risk to people and structures on the ground, never mind in cases like this one where it fails to open and thus impacts at a much greater velocity. A 20kg sack falling from 100m will hurt if it hits you, but it probably won't kill you.

In this case, that avoids the problems they have had with packages drifting over the ocean or into Israeli territory.\n\nIf they are going to continue to drop from higher altitude with containers under canopy, they should have a lead plane that drops a sonde or even just a smaller package to verify the windspeed and direction for updating the primary release point on any subsequent drops.
