The graft probe has ensnared more than a dozen senior defense officials over the past six months, in what may be China\u2019s largest crackdown on the country\u2019s military in modern history.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the US assesses that Xi hasn\u2019t been weakened by the widening purge, according to the people. Rather, they said, his move to oust senior figures \u2014 including some promoted under his watch \u2014 shows his hold over the Communist Party remains firm and that he\u2019s serious about improving discipline, eliminating corruption and ultimately preparing China\u2019s military for combat over the long term.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if you don&#39;t believe the &quot;water instead of fuel&quot;, the public removals of a ton of top officials are real, and it&#39;s silly to think the US has just sat around after losing the spy network in <del>2016</del> 2012.

It\u2019s why the main way people measure corruption is via \u201cperception\u201d (which of course is flawed, since some things may be perceived as corruption in some places but not others). \n\nHowever, since Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign started, government employees in general have been a lot more afraid of doing public showings of wealth such as expensive dinners. While again this isn\u2019t quantifiable, it\u2019s backed up by numerous anecdotes of people asking officials to a restaurant and being told \u201cwe can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d In general, I would argue corruption has significantly gotten better, since officials know they\u2019re being watched closely nowadays.\n\nXi may also be using this campaign as a way to consolidate power, but it\u2019s silly to say corruption has worsened or been unchanged since it began, especially among officials of lower standing.

Empty rhetoric.    \n\nAnd this does have consequences for NATO because NATO, ultimately, is only words.
