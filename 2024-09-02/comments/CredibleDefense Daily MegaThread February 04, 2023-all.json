Alternatively one could suggest this was done by a hawkish faction within China in an attempt to postpone or even cancel the Blinken trip.\n\nIt's also plausible that this is some private group/university launching the balloon without thinking about possible consequences - but a similar balloon has been seen over Japan in the past and apparently there's currently one floating around South America, so seems unlikely. US intelligence also seems pretty confident that it is in fact a spy balloon.

Alternatively one could suggest this was done by a hawkish faction within China in an attempt to postpone or even cancel the Blinken trip.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also plausible that this is some private group/university launching the balloon without thinking about possible consequences - but a similar balloon has been seen over Japan in the past and apparently there&#39;s currently one floating around South America, so seems unlikely. US intelligence also seems pretty confident that it is in fact a spy balloon. Moreover, you&#39;d think something like a university&#39;s big balloon launch would be covered in a local news article somewhere - it seems unlikely that the Chinese foreign ministry would&#39;ve been unable to dig up such an article.</p>\n</div>",

This could&#39;ve been done by Wednesday morning, considering the US found out about it Tuesday--though waiting until an opportune moment where the least risk to major urban centers is preferable. Thursday should&#39;ve been the very last day the balloon was in the air--the sooner, the better. There still would&#39;ve been risk, but compared to the long-term harm this will result in--the gains that would&#39;ve far eclipsed any harm.</p>\n</div>",

They're not stealthy balloons, they're visible to the naked eye and I'm sure radar tracked them right away.\n\nFirst up China has likely been using these for several years including over India and Japan.\n\n[http://www.hisutton.com/Chinese-Navy-High-Altitude-Spy-Balloons.html](http://www.hisutton.com/Chinese-Navy-High-Altitude-Spy-Balloons.html)\n\nThere may have been many missions that were not detected.\n\nIn terms of \"stealth\", well what does a radar see? Operators are not going to be fixated on finding objects with weak returns moving at the speed of the wind. Software likely washes this out by design. They may actually be able to sneak across under normal circumstances. This one may (or may not) have been lower than usual, thus visually sighted, they can get up a lot higher than this. Its all a bit of guess work. Sources are claiming the US has noted these before (stick a pin in this thought, I will come back to it)\n\nWhat ever happened its  more likely a small part of the Chinese government thought it was being super clever rather than something from Xi and the top.\n\nMy pet theory is that the US got tired of watching these things pass over and pulled China on them this time. In 8 weeks time the average voter will have to be prompted to remember this happened. Its like that killer hornets story from a couple of years ago, it just blows over once the drama is done. US does not want to shoot them down as it would be an utter ballache to get all the relevant local, state and federal authorities to agree how to do it and mitigate everything from risks of forest fires to damage from the bullets. Once it hits the ground you will likely need a bomb disposal team to make safe any explosive bolts, then hazmat teams to ensure there is nothing like hydrozene or so on on them. Then have to build a road to the crash site and bring in very large trucks to lift it. All the time having every news network act like aliens had landed.\n\nI know people think this is easy, but when you dont have a pre agreed plan to shoot down a harmless object.... the legal work would be off the charts. They will perhaps ping it over water to show they could.\n\nWhat follows is my wild supposition but I suspect US radars do track it, though I just said its hard for radars to do so.

Now the US got one where they felt they could let everyone know they now track em.\n\nYou asked for theories, I have offered mine. I could give half a dozne other ones.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>What&#39;s everyone&#39;s theory on the goal of the spy balloons?  </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t understand why the Chinese just wouldn&#39;t use satellites if they wanted to observe us. I&#39;ve heard some people float the idea that satellites can&#39;t stay on target for long, so we can hide what we want from them on a schedule, but that doesn&#39;t make balloons a viable alternative. They&#39;re not stealthy balloons, they&#39;re visible to the naked eye and I&#39;m sure radar tracked them right away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First up China has likely been using these for several years including over India and Japan.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hisutton.com/Chinese-Navy-High-Altitude-Spy-Balloons.html\">http://www.hisutton.com/Chinese-Navy-High-Altitude-Spy-Balloons.html</a></p>\n\n<p>There may have been many missions that were not detected.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of &quot;stealth&quot;, well what does a radar see? Operators are not going to be fixated on finding objects with weak returns moving at the speed of the wind. Software likely washes this out by design. They may actually be able to sneak across under normal circumstances. This one may (or may not) have been lower than usual, thus visually sighted, they can get up a lot higher than this. Its all a bit of guess work. Sources are claiming the US has noted these before (stick a pin in this thought, I will come back to it)</p>\n\n<p>What ever happened its  more likely a small part of the Chinese government thought it was being super clever rather than something from Xi and the top.</p>\n\n<p>My pet theory is that the US got tired of watching these things pass over and pulled China on them this time. In 8 weeks time the average voter will have to be prompted to remember this happened. Its like that killer hornets story from a couple of years ago, it just blows over once the drama is done. US does not want to shoot them down as it would be an utter ballache to get all the relevant local, state and federal authorities to agree how to do it and mitigate everything from risks of forest fires to damage from the bullets. Once it hits the ground you will likely need a bomb disposal team to make safe any explosive bolts, then hazmat teams to ensure there is nothing like hydrozene or so on on them. Then have to build a road to the crash site and bring in very large trucks to lift it. All the time having every news network act like aliens had landed.</p>\n\n<p>I know people think this is easy, but when you dont have a pre agreed plan to shoot down a harmless object.... the legal work would be off the charts. They will perhaps ping it over water to show they could.</p>\n\n<p>What follows is my wild supposition but I suspect US radars do track it, though I just said its hard for radars to do so. I think that after Japan and India they will have added software to watch for the signature and someone has a very boring job of looking at 1000 stray weather balloons a week or something before this one was a thing. Now the US got one where they felt they could let everyone know they now track em.</p>\n\n<p>You asked for theories, I have offered mine. I could give half a dozne other ones.</p>\n</div>",

There are two primary data providers that most in the West use for price discovery on various Russian oil products: Argus and Platts. They\u2019ve both been incredibly tightly correlated throughout this period, with a very small deviation between the two. The premise that \u201cprivate\u201d price setting on Asian flows is not being considered seems too simplistic, but perhaps is conceivable, even if unlikely. If so, are Russia, China and India all misrepresenting data? Possible. But, to what extent and how frequently? In a post yesterday, I said let\u2019s assume Russia\u2019s weighted average for the different grades of oil they sold was $55 (they reported $49.48 for Urals). Let\u2019s bump it up by $5 and make it $60, to be generous. Does that mean the oil cap is a failure? Well, look at the price discount to Brent pre-cap: the current discount is roughly 10 percentage points higher. \n\nThe question on the 36% is highly likely to be because of flows due to what happened in December and periodicity. The article negates to mention that weather played a significant role in the over 1mmbpd decline in December, so January\u2019s figures were just a matter of normalization. Based on Platts\u2019s and Vortexa\u2019s data, that number is way too low on a sustainable level going forward. Another possible explanation is what\u2019s defined as a \u201cEuropean\u201d shipping firm has become harder to discern. Either way, this is an absolutely moot point, because the price, even at $50, is well below the cap rate. So, for the purposes of the article, it\u2019s irrelevant whether the ship was Russian or European.\n\nLastly, on a point that the Economist doesn\u2019t take into account is Russian production, which has nothing to do with the price cap. And on that front, the lowest sequential decline estimate that I\u2019ve seen is 500kbpd. Wood Mackenzie had it at 800kbpd. Citi had the highest forecasted decline at 1mmbpd. So, Russian crude has been flowing freely to China and India, where it\u2019s refined, and the refined products then flow back to Europe. But refined products also carry higher prices and bigger margins. So, unless this policy comes back to bite Europe by pushing up diesel, jet fuel, NGLs and  gasoil prices (the reason I personally thought this was too high risk an endeavor,) pushing Russia to change its product mix and sell lower margin crude, and making them ship products that take an extra ~30 days to get there, has already done way more than many skeptics like myself believed possible 3 months ago.\n\n> call our financial expert \n\nLet\u2019s not get carried away.",

The Ukrainians have used that proximity to lob artillery shells at the trains, limiting Russia\u2019s ability to move men and equipment between the two fronts and, ultimately, to achieve its stated aim of capturing the Donbas, which comprises the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk.\u2019</p>\n</div>",

But this incident doesn't materially change any of the facts, no.\n\nThe first balloon flew over another country in the 1780s, one was shot down over another country in 1916. The first aircraft flying higher than the Armstrong limit (as this balloon was) passed over another country in the 1950s, and one was shot down doing so in 1960. The first satellite passed over another country in the 1950s, anti-satellite weapons were built in the 1960s and to date nobody has shot down someone else's satellite, nor shot down any satellite \"over\" another country.\n\n\"Over\" in quotes because it's usually more useful to think of satellites, particularly low ones, as occupying their entire orbital path more than any particular location on a map. I don't *think* any country has claimed that an orbit passing overhead frequently or infrequently is any kind of violation of their airspace or in any way related to balloons, though perhaps some have.\n\n80km is frankly very low for a definition of where space is, and I'm happy to get into the weeds on \"where\" \"space\" is and what that question even means if anyone's actually interested. But suffice to say that this balloon was not in space or anything like space. Things do change, but today aviation happens up to about 15km and unusual aviation doesn't go much over 50km, whereas even the lowest unusual satellites are more like 200km and pass over the breadth of the US in minutes not days.\n\nThe most we can say is that this balloon was a specialised kind of high altitude aviation, but it's not one where shootdowns haven't occurred in the past.

Because it is surprisingly hard and balloons haven't been a serious threat since Japan used them in WWII, so nobody has been following the \"anti-balloon\" tech tree much lately.\n\nLack of capabilities?

It depends a lot on the specifics of the balloon&#39;s equipment and the classified capabilities of the missiles.</p>\n\n<p>Ground based missiles need to be in place and pretty close to directly under it since the missile will have to expend a lot of its energy just going up nearly 12 miles. And the ground based missiles will start running into the same guidance nuances the the missiles above have.</p>\n\n<p>Also the risk to civilians from falling debris is a concern. It is possible that the US had the response ready days ago but was waiting for safer circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>So in answer to your questions:</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because it is surprisingly hard and balloons haven&#39;t been a serious threat since Japan used them in WWII, so nobody has been following the &quot;anti-balloon&quot; tech tree much lately.</p>\n\n<p>Lack of capabilities? Sort of yes. I have little doubt a sea launched SM3 could do it, but over land the US does have a bit of a weakness in land based AA.</p>\n</div>",

Tens of billions of dollars was spent on the Zumwalt class which has been rendered more or less pointless. The navy spent so long on failed destroyer and cruiser designs that they're still building Arleigh Burke classes despite being intended to have construction stop 15 years ago.\n\nThe air force similarly keeps operating the A10s which are not really suitable to modern battlefields and haven't had the best service records when used. The F35 program got frankensteined into being too expensive by forcing it to support a STOVL variant, and now even though we have an advanced fighter design the navy is still ordering F18s and the air force is still ordering F15s (and F16s? not sure).\n\nThe marines keep being dragged back and forth from being \"we have the army at home\" to a distinct force and just tossed aside all their tanks recently as a consequence from reaching one end of that pendulum. Congress consistently orders more tanks than the army wants. I find military tech fascinating and the number of vehicle designs (especially for the army) that had billions of dollars spent on them before cancellation over the past 20 years is kind of crazy.\n\nHow much money is spent on maintaining mothballed tanks that if we're all honest with ourselves will never find use? Ukraine is basically the ideal scenario for old, no longer cutting edge, equipment to be brought out of storage and shipped off to an ally to use in combat. But even here we've largely been shipping them more modern vehicles (the Abrams are expected to be M1A2 SEPv2 I believe). If we cannot bring ourselves to find a use for 20, 30, 40+ year old tanks now, we have to accept that we never will and should scrap them rather than spend the money on basic maintenance of the facility and vehicles.\n\nThe DOD occasionally asks to do a BRAC to shutdown and consolidate bases that are costing billions of dollars and congress consistently says no (because no one wants to lose a base in their district).\n\nDoesn't fall under DOD budget but the Department of Energy spends an enormous amount of money (tens of billions annually) maintaining our nuclear arsenal. Which is an important task, don't get me wrong. Yet it could be a far cheaper task if we weren't maintaining nearly 4000 warheads with 1500 in active use. Even 700 in active use and nothing else would still have the US as the second largest active nuclear stockpile in the world and would be way more than enough to be a sufficient deterrence. Could possibly even help with slowing down nuclear proliferation, but that's not certain and would only be a side benefit if it happened.\n\nAlso relevant is that the military has gone on a whiplash of operational goals over the past 20 years. Beyond the lives unnecessarily lost in Iraq and Afghanistan, we pissed away trillions of dollars and got the military focused on an occupation-centric role rather than one of opposing major world powers (read: China).\n\nTrying to shorten things: the military (and/or congress, depending on the specific item) is unwilling/unable to retire old platforms or bases and replace them solely with newer platforms or just go with the downsizing so as to maintain force effectiveness without ballooning the budget. Some sensible downsizings and being smart about new designs would save *a lot* of money with minimal effect on overall effectiveness. $400b a year? Not a chance. But enough money to be worth it.",

I don't think I have to say much here, except to mention: electric vehicles, battery technology, AI research, the number of STEM graduates per year, the Chinese space station, landing rovers on the Moon and Mars, etc. Nobody who has gone to China regularly over the last 15 years could possibly say the country hasn't advanced technologically. It's like night and day. His characterization of Chinese students is also just a crude trope. Yes, Chinese education does involve more memorization than American education, but it's also way more rigorous and demanding in math and science. China is producing a lot of STEM talent every year, as anyone who has visited Silicon Valley or any American STEM graduate program knows.\n\n2. China will \"go away\" in 10 years. Joe Rogan pressed Zeihan on this, and Zeihan just smugly replied, \"Yeah, they'll die.\"\n\n3. \"There's nothing to fear from a war over Taiwan.\" Zeihan thinks it'll be no big deal. Easy.\n\n4. Even if China captured TSMC intact, they wouldn't have any idea what to do with it. They can't even run their own fabs, because they're all incompetent. \"That's why their fabs are the worst in the world.\" China is a significant player in chip fabrication. China isn't at the leading edge, but it has a very substantial share of the market in mature nodes, and it has managed to push down to 14nm (and seems to be developing 7nm processes). There are only a few companies anywhere in the world that are fabricating chips at the leading edge. Just because a country isn't producing leading-edge chips, that doesn't mean that it is incapable of running a fab.\n\n5. Nobody on the Chinese Politburo is competent. They're all just flunkies. This is where I wish Rogan had asked Zeihan to name one Politburo member, other than Xi. I would bet Zeihan has no idea who's even on the committee. You can look up some of these guys' CVs online. Yes, they are politically aligned with Xi, but a lot of them also have pretty impressive credentials (e.g., several higher degrees, and decades of experience in government, all the way from the lowest level to multiple stints as provincial governors).\n\nFinally, you can look up Zeihan's previous predictions of China's imminent collapse. [In 2010, Zeihan predicted that China would collapse](https://www.businessinsider.com/stratfor-predictions-for-the-next-decade-2010-1) within the decade.

If you make it harder to access contraception, I would assume (perhaps incorrectly) that the birthrate will go up.

Isn't it the case that increasing access to contraception lowers teen pregnancy rates?\n\n>I question the capacity for any state to substantially increase fertility rates\n\nThere's another comment below mine that addresses that you responded to that addresses this point. Hungary got to a 1.55 TFR with just financial incentives - even if you argue that there's no way China can do better, a 1.55 TFR is still better than the UN's mid range fertility estimate for China, which requires that it increases to 1.48 by 2100. It's worth noting Russia got its TFR up to 1.78 before the Crimea annexation and subsequent sanctions, which presumably tanked living standards.\n\nI'm not claiming China is going to get to a TFR of 2.1, I'm claiming that China could plausibly get to a TFR of maybe 1.6 or something by 2050, which would offset the effects of demographic collapse.\n\n>Reverting to full blown totalitarianism \n\nIf China manages to build a decently comfortable welfare state, would something like a tax for being single or married with no kids *really* be totalitarianism?",

The post-Crimea sanctions were deliberately targeted at Russia's wealthy decision-makers, not their economy as a whole. The period of TFR increase in Russia correlates better with oil price, with the peak TFR in 2015 (the year of the price crash).

I see totalitarianism as likely being necessary to *ensure* that most families are having more kids, i.e. effectively monitoring and enforcing measures to coerce enough families to substantially increase TFR. You seem to only be envisioning a slight bump in TFR, though; I was originally thinking about what it might take to get TFR close to 2.0. A tax on having fewer kids might have an effect, but again, the question is the magnitude of this effect. You cannot squeeze water from a stone.\n\nThe problem with China's TFR is not just the number itself. It's the existing demographic imbalances that cannot be fixed with a sub-2.1 replacement rate, as well as this sub-optimal TFR existing during a crucial phase of economic transition. China managing to up their TFR to 1.55 would be a bandaid, not a solution. This is assuming that economic incentives and contrasceptive bans in China have the same quantitative effect as those in Hungary.",
