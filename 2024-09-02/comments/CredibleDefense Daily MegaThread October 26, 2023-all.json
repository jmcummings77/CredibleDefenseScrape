Still undecided is whether the reevaluation will entail an exodus of Hamas leaders from Qatar, where they have long maintained a political office in the capital, or steps that come short of that, these officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\n>The agreement is an attempt to balance the Biden administration\u2019s short-term goal of rescuing as many hostages as possible with its long-term objective of trying to isolate Hamas following its Oct. 7 rampage in Israel.\n\n>\u201cAll I can say with regard to Qatar is, in this instance, we very much appreciate their assistance,\u201d Blinken told reporters last week when asked if he thinks Qatar\u2019s hosting of the Hamas office is worthwhile. \u201cWe want to focus on making sure that we\u2019re getting those who remain hostage back home and with their loved ones. That\u2019s the single most important thing.\u201d\n\n>Qatar, a tiny gas-rich peninsula in the Persian Gulf, has been instrumental in helping the United States and Israel secure the release of hostages and communicating with Hamas on other pressing issues, including the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the safe passage of Palestinian-Americans out of the besieged enclave.\n\n>But its decision to provide harbor to Hamas\u2019s political leaders and host an office for their operations, dating back more than a decade, has come under scrutiny by Republicans in Congress and other pro-Israel hard-liners.\n\n>\u201cI want to see President Biden go after our allies that we have, like the Qataris \u2026 and extradite these Hamas terrorists,\u201d Rep. Max L. Miller (R-Ohio) told reporters this month.\n\n>Since the cross-border attack, the Biden administration has adopted the Israeli government\u2019s policy of likening Hamas to the Islamic State and pressured foreign governments and financial institutions to cut ties with the group, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007. \u201cThere can be no more business as usual with Hamas,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Qatar on Oct. 13.\n\n>The Treasury Department has launched a global campaign, imposing sanctions on Hamas members and financial facilitators in Algeria, Sudan, Turkey, Qatar and other places. The militant group receives economic and military support from Iran, Israel\u2019s chief adversary.\n\n>But a zero-tolerance policy on Hamas associations threatens the delicate, ongoing hostage negotiations between the group and Qatar, talks that saw their first major breakthrough on Friday with the release of two American women who had been abducted in the assault. Since then, two Israeli women also have been freed. The Israeli government said Wednesday that more than half of the Hamas hostages have passports from foreign countries, including 54 Thai nationals, 15 Argentines, 12 Germans, 12 Americans, six French and six Russians.\n\n>More than any previous conflict in the Middle East, the war between Israel and Hamas is testing Qatar\u2019s ability to manage its diverse portfolio of contacts without crossing red lines with core partners.\n\n>Its recent mediation efforts have elicited applause from the United States and rare praise from Israel.\n\n>\u201cQatar is becoming an essential party and stakeholder in the facilitation of humanitarian solutions. Qatar\u2019s diplomatic efforts are crucial at this time,\u201d Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n>While the potential departure of Hamas leaders from Qatar would represent a long-sought goal by pro-Israel hard-liners, it would likely drive the group\u2019s representatives to take up residence in less friendly harbors, said experts, potentially diminishing the West\u2019s ability to negotiate thorny issues such as cease-fire agreements, humanitarian pauses or prisoner swaps.\n\n>\u201cIf Hamas leaders left Qatar, they would likely go to Iran or Syria or Lebanon, or somewhere farther afield such as Algeria,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a Middle East scholar and former official at the CIA. \u201cRelocating to Syria would amount to a feather in the cap of President Bashar al-Assad but they would most likely just move to Iran.\u201d\n\n>Qatar, unlike many actors in the Middle East, has sought to keep open lines of communication throughout the region and leverage its ties with a diverse array of players.\n\n>As a champion of the Palestinian cause, the wealthy nation of 2.7 million people pays the salaries of civil servants in Gaza and makes direct cash transfers to poor families there.\n\n>It hosts Hamas political leaders including Ismail Haniyeh, the group\u2019s supreme leader, and Khaled Mashaal, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 1997. In 2012, Qatar\u2019s then-emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Hamas-controlled Gaza.\n\n>Qatar also has maintained low-key ties to Israel when other Gulf nations were firmly opposed to any contact. In the 1990s, Qatar permitted an Israeli trade office, the Jewish state\u2019s only outpost in the Gulf.\n\n>Qatar, the biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, shares the world\u2019s largest natural gas field with Iran, resulting in a less hawkish policy toward Tehran than the one pursued by its neighbors, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.\n\n>Key to Qatar\u2019s security is its close partnership with the U.S. military. The country is home to the forward headquarters of U.S. Central Command, the largest U.S. military installation in the Middle East.\n\n>During the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Qatar\u2019s Al-Udeid base was a central node in Washington\u2019s massive evacuation effort of Americans, foreigners and Afghan allies. During the Trump administration, Qatar also hosted negotiations between U.S. and Taliban leaders aimed at ending the conflict.\n\n>Washington considers Qatar a major non-NATO ally and the two engage in billions of dollars in military sales.\n\n>Besides negotiating the release of hostages, Qatar has also played a fixer role for the United States in various situations.\n\n>In the recent U.S. prisoner swap with Iran involving the unblocking of $6 billion in Iranian oil revenue, Qatar agreed to manage the money. The agreement limited Iran\u2019s access to the funds to humanitarian items such as food and medicine. But after the Oct. 7 attack and in response to pressure from the U.S. Congress, Doha and Washington agreed not to act on requests from Tehran to access those funds for the time being.\n\n>\u201cQatar has a 360 degree foreign policy,\u201d said Riedel. \u201cThey host senior Hamas political officials. They provide the United States with a huge air base. They talk to the Iranians. They cover all their bases so they can communicate with anybody at any time in a low-key fashion.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/26/qatar-hamas-hostage-negotiations/",

These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17. As a result of these attacks, one U.S. citizen contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place; 21 U.S. personnel suffered from minor injuries, but all have since returned to duty. The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today\u2019s action to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests.\n\n>The United States does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities, but these Iranian-backed attacks against U.S. forces are unacceptable and must stop. Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them. If attacks by Iran\u2019s proxies against U.S. forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people.\nThese narrowly tailored strikes in self-defense were intended solely to protect and defend U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria. They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict. We continue to urge all state and non-state entities not to take action that would escalate into a broader regional conflict.",

The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today\u2019s action to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests.</p>\n\n<p>The United States does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities, but these Iranian-backed attacks against U.S. forces are unacceptable and must stop. Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them. If attacks by Iran\u2019s proxies against U.S. forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people.\nThese narrowly tailored strikes in self-defense were intended solely to protect and defend U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria. They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict. We continue to urge all state and non-state entities not to take action that would escalate into a broader regional conflict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Another reason to never trust what the enemy writes.</p>\n\n<p>Berdyansky touch - the katsaps are trying to regain the positions they lost in the summer near Priyutny.</p>\n\n<p>Zaporizhzhya flavor \u2014 counter-battles near Verbovoy and Novoprokopivka continue. The Defense Forces improved their tactical position near Nesteryanka and Kopany.</p>\n\n<p>Taurian shade - no changes. We recommend waiting for official comments.</p>\n\n<p>Analytical note. A difficult situation remains along the entire front line due to the widespread engagement of infantry formations, equipment and drones by the enemy. The weather makes its adjustments, but they are not in our favor. Now it is important to approach the information soberly and not panic because of the fighting in Avdiivka. This is war and it is normal when there are maneuvers. Bad - when they are not there. In many other areas, the situation is dire, even in Tavriysk.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Food for thought on Avdiivka. Last Friday Putin visited the Southern Military District HQ in Rostov-on-Don, where he also met with Gerasimov. What's believed is that he confirmed his will to take Avdiivka. \n\nSince the beginning of the war, most of the DPR Army, now 1st Corps, has been concentrated around Avdiivka. The large majority of the actions against the city have been the work of it. The DPR forces had immense losses against Avdiivka. Such sector has been, arguably, always one of the areas with the best UA:RU KIAs ratio for the Ukrainians. At times the regular army provided support. For example, in March 2023, when there were major advances (especially in the north-east of the city), there were also the 20th Motorized Division (8th Army, SMD) and the 136th Motorized Brigade (58th Army, SMD) deployed, respectively, in the southern and north-eastern flanks of the city, along with, probably, some elements of the VDV. This time, however, the 1st Corps (subordinate to the 8th Army) received a very important reinforcement: most of the formations of the Central Military District. This is afaik the first time that formations unrelated to the former DPR Army (or to the Southern MD) are active in Avdiivka and the first time since the beginning of the war that Central MD's formations are deployed so far south. This may suggest something about the Russian determination right now regarding Avdiivka.\n\nFirstly, let's have a recap of the actions. As for the north-eastern flank, in April 2022 the Russians seized Novobakhmutivka. In the following August they managed to take Novoselivka Druha. In February 2023 the Russians began a major offensive in the area, eventually succeeding in capturing Krasnohorivka and Vesele. On the southern flank, progress came later. The situation was unlocked in August 2022, when the Russians succeeded in taking Pisky, thanks to a frightening artillery fire (I don't know how many places had such a density of arrivals per square meter) that basically destroyed an entire battalion of the Ukrainian 56th Motorized Brigade, with the Ukrainians still having very serious fire and counter-battery capability issues back then. In November they managed to take Opytne, the southern part of Vodyane and reached the unfinished ring road in several points. In the February/March offensive they succeeded in taking all of Vodyane and pushed onto the first tree line to the north of the village.\n\nThe summer in Avdiivka was fairly quiet, thanks to the transfer elsewhere of the units outside the 1st Corps (including sending part of the 3rd Corps to Bakhmut). Several elements of 1st Corps were also deployed along the southern front to increase force density. Units from some brigades/regiments of 1st (and 2nd) Corps are being embedded in the most battered Russian formations in order to restaff them. In any case, during this period the formations of the 1st Corps received new personnel, new equipment, and stockpiled ammos. \n\nOccasionally there was some action. The Ukrainians in September managed to undo what the Russians had gained to the north of Opytne during the winter and reached the gates of the settlement. The Russians, as was their standard from the spring onwards, attacked mainly on the eastern flank of Avdiivka, from the H20 Highway. Since October 1 there was an intensification of the actions (along with massive artillery/FABs arrivals), but the real offensive started on October 10. As I understand it, the Ukrainians didn't expect such an offensive, the intensity of which was discovered the same morning thanks to the usual morning drone reconnaissance which proved crucial to repel the attacks. \n\nLet's have a list the elements of strength and risk in Avdiivka. The southern flank is the safest right now, in my view. Here the Russian advance has been minor and it seems to have been stopped altogether over the past week (except for some very small advances towards the dachas of Pervomaiske, just above the Novoavdeevskiy Stavok Lake). The Russians advanced, on average, a few hundred meters and only at a limited point (i.e. to the south-west of Sjeverne) they were able to take positions along the last \"latitudinal\" tree line before Sjeverne. The Russians would also have recovered the Optyne quarry they had lost in September. \n\nAt the moment I am not too concerned about this direction. The Ukrainians have entrenched every tree line and mined the fields; approaching the city of Avdiidkva there are several Ukrainian strongholds massively reinforced after 2015 that the Russians never captured: the former Air Defense base north-west of Spartak (beyond the unfinished ring road), the former \"Tsarska Ohota\" restaurant just before the Avdiivka-Jasynuvata railway, and the Donetsk Filtration Station just east of the H20 Highway (if anyone needs the coordinates - just tell me). Which is the reason why, for now, the Russians have never attempted to directly assault that area (from the Mineralne area) in force. In the southern flank it could be assumed that the 9th \"Marine\" Brigade of the 1st Corps is nearly exhaustion (the 1st Motorized Brigade of the same corps holds the areas of this flank closest to Avdiivka) and probably the Russians are waiting for the arrival of additional elements of the 41st Army (CMD). \n\nThe north-eastern flank is definitely the one which deserves a greater concern. The Russians reportedly succeeded in getting close to the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway. From what I understand, the actions on the first day, October 10, would have resulted in a several hundred meters of gain by the 114th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps + a few supporting units. In the following days elements of the 2nd Army (CMD) entered the field. We had known for some time the 21st Motorized Brigade was in the area; the 15th Motorized Brigade is also confirmed to be in that area (the Storm Z detachment of this brigade was certainly involved, as was that of the 21st - moreover, the 15th fields BTR-82s); the 30th Motorized Brigade which was thought to have gone to the Volnovakha area (from Svatove, like the rest of the army) could also be in the north-east flank of Avdiivka. They would also have been reinforced by Spetsnaz detachments (from the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade from Novosibirsk, usually attached to the 41st Army - probably those of the 3rd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade which used to follow the 2nd Army will also arrive or have already arrived), while now the 114th Brigade is more active in the Terrikon area. \n\nAs far as I got it, within days from the start of the offensive the Russians would have already come very close to the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway. At that point there would have been a counterattack by elements of the 47th Mechanized Brigade (from the north-west) that drove the Russians away from that corner between the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk and the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railways. The Russians also were never able to pass the latter railroad and progress towards Novokalynove was extremely limited. They would, however, have been able to approach to the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway in a section starting further south (from the dirt road leading to Krasnohorivka) down to the Terrikon, which the Ukrainians reportedly lost. This is certainly a negative development, because the Ukrainian lines on the fields between the railroad and Krasnohorivka during the last months had a favorable altitude advantage compared to the Russian ones. At present there's no indication to claim that the Russians are setting up positions immediately close to the railroad, which is a formidable Ukrainian defense line.\n\nRussian artillery is less effective in Avdiivka compared to other places. The Russians can see what the Ukrainians are doing on the surface with drones, but they cannot see what's happening underground. Below the ground the Ukrainians rest, store ammos, stabilize the wounded, etc. I had wrote about this a few months ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/151zyqc/comment/jsctfhy), based on an interview with a member of the \"Pyatnashka\" Battalion. This battalion, along with \"Somalia\" and \"Sparta\" are considered the elite of the former DPR Army. They are largely made up of volunteers from Russia proper. Despite the fact that the sector has always been very dangerous, these units manage to attract a number of volunteers who want to be deployed precisely in Avdiivka as they are sincerely convinced about the reports of \"Nazi artillery shelling Russian children in Donetsk\". Avdiivka's greatest importance is political. For the Russians, it represents a Ukrainian stronghold extremely close to the city of Donetsk and whose occupation is crucial for the \"security\" of the capital of the former DPR and for bringing forward the project of the \"liberation\" of Donbas. Strategically speaking, for the Russians, Avdiivka wouldn't guarantee new operational depths that could make the capture of the city worth it, except, again, from a political point of view, and reflexively, considering the backlash to Ukrainian morale that the loss of the city would cause.\n\nAndrew Perpetua had written about a potential shortage of shells on the Ukrainian side. I'm not aware of this, but if Perpetua wrote it, he had reasons to do so. What I've heard is that the Russians have noticed that around Bakhmut the Ukrainian artillery fire has decreased from the intensity of the past weeks and today, if we are to trust them, it's for the vast majority DPICMs. Which could be, if true, an indication that they had to allocate higher volumes of standard shells to Avdiivka. The issue of mortar ammo is true, there's always too little of it. Last part of my comment below.",

There are also tunnels that start from under the coke plant. Since 2015 these tunnels have been expanded, and today to my knowledge they cover a good part of the city, with Ukrainian infantrymen being able to avoid going through the surface of the city. But... there's a corollary to this. Avdiivka, from a military point of view, IS its coke plant. Without the plant, the city wouldn't hold in my opinion. And moreover, the access road to Avdiivka passes just behind the plant. By taking the Terrikon, the Russians have come very close to the north-eastern boundary of coke plant. At the moment there are no reported Russian positions on this tailings heap. The tactical importance of this artificial hill in itself is not that high: other than a few observation/sniping points, heavy equipment can't be deployed on the heap and the surface can be hit e.g. with cluster munitions. Still, the railroad dividing the coke plant from the Terrikon must be defended harshly and the Russians must be kept out of it. The Russians are using a large number of FABs against Avdiivka, particularly the coke plant, which, however, is built to resist heavy bombings.\n\nThe Russians are taking very high material and human losses, much more than the Ukrainians are. If I had to make an estimate, let's say a 1:5 KIAs ratio wouldn't even seem optimistic at all, at this stage. However, we have to have a discussion about the consequences of these losses. What are the acceptable losses, for the Russians? We don't know. What are the losses that, even if successful, could make the operation a Pyrrhic victory with negative long-term consequences for them? We don't know. We don't know how many losses the Russians are willing to take to capture Avdiivka, but these could be really high. This is justified by the fact that there are not that many kilometers on which they have to advance to dangerously tighten the pincer and the Russians might accept a very high number of losses as long as it brings positional gains that they aim to consolidate. Once they've made gains, they could push again. It could be as early as next week, it could be in January/February 2024. But every 100 meters the Russians manage to take, the risks arise. \n\nWith the current situation the Ukrainians can afford just one \"mistake\" imho. That is the loss of Stepove/Berdychi or Sjeverne/Tonenke (on Tonenke I have doubts, being too close to Orlivka). The loss of the coke plant is not allowed. None of these situations is imaginable at the moment, but it's what the Russians clearly aspire to (especially the first option). And such a mistake would greatly complicate things in the city nevertheless.\n\nI see many comparisons with Bakhmut being made. I don't agree that much with them. Bakhmut was a different battle in many respects. The flanks were massively bigger, and there were times when the Russians were able to achieve a legit breakthrough that got the Ukrainians into trouble, causing very high casualties (Soledar, first and foremost), well before the dirt road south of Khromove remained the only way to get in and out of the city. None of this happened in Avdiivka so far. There were slight Russian advances, but no unplanned breakthroughs, and Ukrainian losses were limited. Avdiivka's network of tunnels and bunkers is unique. Moreover, urban warfare raged in Bakhmut during the last months. In regards to Avdiivka, I find likely that there will never be a real major urban battle. Also because the Ukrainian strongholds along the outskirts of the city are too strong. What I believe is that the Russians will try to advance further on the flanks. At that point: either they will continue getting pushed back, or they will advance up to a point that will force a Ukrainian withdrawal from Avdiivka before there are chances for a pocket.  \n\nIf we want to make a comparison, the Russians could aim for a maxi version of Zolote in June 2022, when the Ukrainian positions around (especially to the south) of this town were very strong and the Russians chose, and succeeded, to break through the flanks around Hirske further north, forcing the withdrawal of 2000 Ukrainian troops to avoid encirclement. But, again, this challenge (breaking through the flanks), for the Russians is, and will be... very, very, very difficult as well as costly. My mood remains the same. The situation at the moment is under control, but one must always keep an eye on the critical issues that are quite a few and always there.",

There *were* major reinforcements from Luhansk sent to the Tokmak front, including 2 whole VDV divisions.

I personally took that to mean that Russia wouldn't want to, or be able to launch a major attack anytime soon without those units since most Russian units outside the VDV and Naval Infantry aren't exactly effective at offensive maneuvers. \n\nThen again, considering the immense Russian losses in men and materiel outside Avdiivka, that assumption was only partially incorrect.

On the surface, Ukraine looks to have a good position in Avdiivka with the massively fortified coke plant serving as an anchor. Breakthroughs haven't occurred yet.

The units that have been bloodied in the AFU counteroffensive now have some experience in the challenges of counterattacking. We see the 47th MB and 1st TB are deployed there now, and I suspect other units will join them. I personally think Russia is overextending themselves on the northern pincer. Krasnohorivka is a crappy place to launch attacks out of. It's a giant pit with a terrible view of surrounding terrain. Ukraine could try to \"pincer the pincer\" with an attack along the H20, or even more ambitiously, south of Niu York.\n\nLastly, it's important to note that Russian success in Bakhmut came from light infantry assaults. This was prior to cluster munitions being given. CM effectiveness has been proven again and again in the last few months. Russia will struggle to achieve these kinds of gains with AFU artillery working much more effectively than earlier this year.",

The Russian infantrymen were covered with all kinds of weapons, the enemy was well seen. The Russians rotated and replaced the knocked out assault units, and threw reserves into battle.\n\nUnits of the 110th mechanized brigade successfully repelled all attacks directly on Avdiivka.\nBut the situation north of Avdiivka seriously worsened. Despite heavy losses, the Russian assault units north of Avdiivka advanced along the railway track, occupied an area up to 1 km wide, trying to expand the controlled corridor and create conditions for the concentration of forces and further offensive in the direction of Stepove-Berdychi, and in the direction of the industrial zone of the Avdiivka coke plant. This is a very serious threat that needs maximum attention. The enemy hopes to gain a foothold in the factory building and gain a bridgehead to enter the city. To the south of Avdiivka, Russian troops continue their attacks with the aim of seizing a sand quarry near the village of Opytne.\n\nSince the rate of losses for the Russian group near Avdiivka is unacceptable, the Russian command withdraws significant forces from the Kupyan direction to continue the infantry attacks. Avdiyivka has much more strategic importance for Ukraine than even Bakhmut. The Russian command will want to show success here at any cost. The tactical situation for the destruction of Russian strike formations is very favorable here. But our advantages must be realized in full. It is not the number of people in uniform that can stop the Russian infantry, and not the number of different units and flags on the map, but qualitatively organized, coordinated and controlled fresh units. And all such reserves are needed right here in order to destroy the Russians precisely in the narrow corridor in which they are fighting. I hope that all the necessary reserves that we have will be directed to the Avdiivka district.\n\nThe situation in Avdiivka is escalating and there is a battle going on, in which the enemy is throwing its main forces, a battle that we, if necessary, have every chance of winning if we concentrate our forces.

Two French frigates are already on location.  \n\n*On Wednesday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron announced, during his trip to Egypt, that France was about to send a military vessel to Gaza to \u201csupport the hospitals\u201d, deprived of electricity due to shortages of fuel.*\n\n*However, given the number of helicopters aboard Tonnerre, Naval News believes this deployment is not exclusively for humanitarian tasks. The vessel could play a key role in evacuating French citizens should the need arise.*\n\nSome interesting naval news from the U.S. Army. [The U.S. Army\u2019s 10th Support Group based in Western Japan is getting the new U.S. Army\u2019s Maneuver Support Vessel (Light) and Maneuver Support Vessel (Heavy) to replace their two vintage Vietnam-era Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) vessels to haul ammunition to three port locations around the bay.] (https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2023/10/u-s-army-10th-support-group-looks-forward-to-using-msvl/).\n\n*The MSV(L) will replace the Landing Craft Mechanized-8, (LCM-8,) a Vietnam-era watercraft. It is the first major Army watercraft acquisition in more than 20 years. The current Army Acquisition Objective is to build 13 vessels. The MSV(L) is 117 feet long and can travel up to 21 knots fully laden and 30 knots unladen. Its range will be 360 nautical miles when fully laden. Eight Army Mariners will crew the MSV(L).

The West Bank isn't even politically unified - parts A are controlled by the PLO, part C and East Jerusalem is controlled by Israel, par B is jointly controlled.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any interest in breaking up the Palestinian territories among the Palestinians, as far as I can tell. A three state solution reminds me of the people who throw out peace proposals for Ukraine and Russia. If one side or the other is completely disinterested in a proposal, then it's a useless proposal.

A three state solution reminds me of the people who throw out peace proposals for Ukraine and Russia. If one side or the other is completely disinterested in a proposal, then it&#39;s a useless proposal. Any peace proposal would work if you could get both sides to agree.

Now imagine their government cede their land for foreigners, on top of that, because they&#39;re forced by the West pressure to do so, in exchange for some money and some &quot;good will&quot; of &quot;international audience&quot;. I&#39;m not sure if these &quot;right people&quot; can take the money in peace or gonna be toppled by the nationalists factions not long after. Taking refuge is one thing, but ceded your territory to establish another state for other foreign people, because of a matter that doesn&#39;t even related to their country is entirely different matter</p>\n</div>",

Such an outcome would clearly not be a win for Ukraine either though, as Russia is still occupying something like 20% of its 1991 territory, including most of Ukraine's coastline, much of Ukraine's best agricultural land, and Russia controls the mouth of the Dnieper further isolating Ukraine from trade. \n\nAs for the long term, that really depends on how the war ends.

If Russia continues to occupy large swathes of Ukrainian territory, it's not going to join NATO and I'm skeptical Ukraine will receive defensive guarantees from the US and other Western powers. Ukraine's future in the EU is also very much an open question, it'll require many revisions to Ukraine's judiciary, political system, justice system, press, and more.

        "body": "Recent article by Pravda on the state of the Russian economy: https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2023/10/26/7425902/\n\nKey points: \n\n-Twenty months into the full-scale invasion, the partners' enthusiasm for introducing new sanctions packages has somewhat waned, and the restrictions that have already been imposed are gradually losing their effectiveness. Moreover, the Russian economy is showing signs of moderate recovery, which has enabled the Russian Ministry of Finance to allocate record war spending in the 2024 budget.\n\n-The Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) has recently released a report on the state of the aggressor country's economy as of October 2023. The report indicates that the Russians have adapted to life under sanctions and are managing to circumvent restrictions and even generate income amid high oil prices.\n\n-Russian oil revenues have been steadily increasing over recent months. It's all thanks to the rise in global oil prices and Russia's expanding ability to circumvent price restrictions with the help of the \"shadow fleet\".\n\n-The necessity to support the Russian federal budget with funds from the NWF fell in 2023 as the situation for the Kremlin began to improve. The budget deficit was shrinking, and there was even a surplus in some months. Consequently, the annual deficit plan reached 58% in January-September, compared to 80% in the first quarter.\n\n-Stabilisation in public finances has paved the way for the Russian Finance Ministry to plan an increase in spending in the 2024 budget. The biggest addition is expected in defence, with spending on the war against Ukraine increasing by 68% - from this year's RUB 6.4 trillion [roughly US$68,08 billion] to RUB 10.8 trillion [roughly US$114,9 billion].\n\n-The devaluation of the rouble has hit Russians not only psychologically, but has already affected the rate of price growth.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Recent article by Pravda on the state of the Russian economy: <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2023/10/26/7425902/\">https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2023/10/26/7425902/</a></p>\n\n<p>Key points: </p>\n\n<p>-Twenty months into the full-scale invasion, the partners&#39; enthusiasm for introducing new sanctions packages has somewhat waned, and the restrictions that have already been imposed are gradually losing their effectiveness. Moreover, the Russian economy is showing signs of moderate recovery, which has enabled the Russian Ministry of Finance to allocate record war spending in the 2024 budget.</p>\n\n<p>-The Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) has recently released a report on the state of the aggressor country&#39;s economy as of October 2023. The report indicates that the Russians have adapted to life under sanctions and are managing to circumvent restrictions and even generate income amid high oil prices.</p>\n\n<p>-Russian oil revenues have been steadily increasing over recent months. It&#39;s all thanks to the rise in global oil prices and Russia&#39;s expanding ability to circumvent price restrictions with the help of the &quot;shadow fleet&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>-The necessity to support the Russian federal budget with funds from the NWF fell in 2023 as the situation for the Kremlin began to improve. The budget deficit was shrinking, and there was even a surplus in some months. Consequently, the annual deficit plan reached 58% in January-September, compared to 80% in the first quarter.</p>\n\n<p>-Stabilisation in public finances has paved the way for the Russian Finance Ministry to plan an increase in spending in the 2024 budget. The biggest addition is expected in defence, with spending on the war against Ukraine increasing by 68% - from this year&#39;s RUB 6.4 trillion [roughly US$68,08 billion] to RUB 10.8 trillion [roughly US$114,9 billion].</p>\n\n<p>-The devaluation of the rouble has hit Russians not only psychologically, but has already affected the rate of price growth. At the beginning of the year, Russian statistics services reported that annual inflation had fallen below the Central Bank&#39;s target of 4%. However, this was primarily due to the high comparative base of 2022, when price growth rates reached 16-18%.</p>\n\n<p>-One of the biggest incentives working to restore the Russian economy is currently military procurement. The funds that the Kremlin uses to equip the occupation army and produce missiles, ammunition and heavy equipment have helped to increase production in related industries.</p>\n</div>",
