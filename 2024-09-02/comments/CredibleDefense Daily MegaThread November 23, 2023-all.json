It's quite a big one, and I haven't seen anyone discuss this on this subreddit, so I'll give a brief summary for those who don't have the time to listen. \nhttps://warontherocks.com/2023/11/adaptation-at-the-front-and-the-big-picture-in-ukraine/\n\n* Ukrainian offensive culminated sometime towards the end of September/early October.\n* Ukrainian marine brigades have crossed the Dnieper, established a bridgehead, not sure if they can sustain the effort and make continued effort. Big problem is that it comes late into the year and is not being supported by an ongoing offensive in Zaporizhia. Thinks that the reasoning for an offensive is to show Ukraine's western backers that they can still take land after summer offensive failed to achieve result. \n* Russian military since October has been trying to seize initiative. Kupiansk, Kreminna front offensives have petered out, but they made some marginal gains.\n* Large scale quick mechanized and manoeuvrer attack at Avdiivka failed so they transitioned to attritional dismounted infantry attacks and are making incremental progress, thinks that Ukrainian forces can hold Avdiivka for some time, but there are some rumours that Ukraine will eventually have to abandon Avdiivka. But doing so will shorten Ukrainian lines and not result in a breakthrough. Doubts Ukrainian political leadership will do a 'fortress Avdiivka' like they did with Bakhmut.\n* Ukrainians are suffering shell hunger across the front to the point they cannot conduct offensive operations, can somewhat compensate with FPV drones, but it is no substitute for artillery. Ukrainian forces are exhausted after 5 months of offensive operations, lost a lot of units. Need to reconstitute and regenerate combat effectiveness. Still well motivated though.\n* Ukraine had a relative advantage in fires over the summer (esp long range precision) but not a decisive advantage to break well entrenched Russian forces who fought better than most predicted due to offensive failures of the past 2 years. Russia has restored its advantage in artillery now.\n* Ukraine has generally done very well on adaptation and innovation, but production is mainly artisanal in small workshops. Uranian FPV drones aren't being fitted with munitions in the production phase, so troops on the front have to do it themselves which is dangerous and has lead to unfortunate consequences, Ukraine has a shortage of munitions for FPV drones. \n* Russia on the other hand is not as good at adapting and innovating, but once they have chosen a design that works, they can scale production much faster.\n* FPV drones are a relatively new challenge for both sides, while Ukraine pioneered them, Russia copied them now has more of them and holds the advantage on the drone front. Mainly due to Russia's big domestic industrial advantage, that Ukraine doesn't have due to reliance on foreign production. \n* FPV drones effectiveness depends a lot on topography due to signals. Mainly used in small groups as their signals conflict with each other, main reason they can't be a replacement for artillery. FPV have made it near impossible to move vehicles in daytime.\n* Assault groups have shrunk further, mainly around 14 people supported by apc's and ifv due to difficulty concentrating troops due to improved ISR and artillery. Russians can have fire on a location within 4-6 min of detecting an attack. Big evolution with command and control using apps and drone feeds from the Ukrainians.\n* EW has evolved to small scale and trench based EW with shorter ranges.\n* Russians have adapted to artillery shortage by using more precision weapons like lancets, krasnopol guided shell and recently 500kg guided bombs. Glide kits are increasingly being used on 1500kg bombs.\n* Ukrainians can see Russian aircraft dropping bombs as they fly on established routes, but can't intercept them\n* Despite successful ATACMS strike, Russian helicopters are still a persistent problem due to dispersed forward bases from which they are resupplying from.\n* No American military observers for unknown reasons, Ukrainians are confused as to why since Brits are there.\n* At best Ukrainian offensive was a missed opportunity, Ryan thinks it was a failure. Both west and Ukraine have to take some blame. Mike thinks the most successful part of the offensive was the tactical fighting as losses were relatively even. Silver lining is that tactical fighting was a draw, but offensive was not successful.\n\n**Most important part of the podcast IMO starts at 26 min. Everyone here should just listen to it:** \n\n* Doesn't think the fighting is positional yet, as Uraine has not entrenched, and they need to learn the lesson from Russian prepared defences.\n* *Ru will be materially advantaged in 2024 in most categories especially in artillery ammunition, drones, cruise missiles*\n* *North Korea has likely sent more artillery ammunition to Russia in the past 2-3 months than Europe has ever sent to Ukraine(!!!!!!!!!!!!!)*\n* Most artillery production in Europe is being financed by American contracts (e.g. Bulgaria, Czechia, Romania etc)\n* Kofman thinks Gerasimov will most likely squander the material advantage as he has done in the past\n* Doesn't think a positional war will benefit Russia, as they need to attack and take the rest of the Donbass. Ukraine will mainly be on the defence and Russian material advantage in 2024 will not be decisive enough.\n* Doesn't seem to think Russia will accept a stalemate.\n* *If the west doesn't make the right decisions soon, Russian advantage in 2024 could turn into a significant advantage in 2025*\n* *Most people don't want to say stalemate as it makes Ukraine's position look bad, Kofman thinks it misses Russia's advantages and if the west accepts a stalemate and reduces aid, Russia's advantages will compound.*\n* Russia hasn't fielded its advantages yet, but more Russian offensives will come.\n* Kofman thinks this winter will be worse than the last, despite western AA systems, as Ukraine is a large country and there is not enough to defend all of it.\n* Ukraine now has the ability to strike Russia with drones and missiles.\n* Ukraine has political problems when it comes to mobilising its younger population.\n* Russia has some manpower issues, but they have enough volunteers to replace losses and regenerate some units, but not enough to conduct large scale rotations. Likely waiting until 'presidential elections' in March to conduct another large scale mobilisation. Have been more successful in recruiting, and that they suffered fewer losses in the Ukrainian offensive than he thought they would.\n* Russia can sustain a defensive war with the current rate of recruitment, but not an offensive one.\n* If Ukraine and west make right decisions, 2024 should be a build year of entrenchment, reconstitution and rotation of units. Learning lessons from 2023, in terms of training and offensive failures. Building stockpiles and fixing logistical issues. Thinks that material from west for another offensive is unlikely until end of 2025.\n* Big worry is if Ukraine tries and fights for initiative from Russia, as Russia can reconstitute more quickly. \n* Russia will likely attack before they are ready again, easier to break their offensive potential defending, regenerate forces while waiting for more qualitative western projects currently in the pipeline.\n\nProbably the most pessimistic I've heard Kofman in a good while, and unfortunately not without good reason.",

It is crazy.\n\nFirst, NATO is an military alliance and EU is an economic and political union. The type of cooperation, decisions and investments needed to ramp up European production is totally outside the realm of NATO and must be handled by the EU for the EU and EU/NATO members. I am certainly not going to argue about the tardiness of the EU, but it is a massive institution, in a constant state of identity crisis, that where never meant to take quick decisions about anything. Personally i am amazed every time they actually manage to agree on anything. I do think there is some confusion and exaggerated negativity about the situation though.\n\nThe EU has put forward in March 2023 a 3 track plan to supply Ukraine and increase weapons platforms, ammunition and missile production:\n\n**Track 1**: Help Member States in sending such ammunition from national stockpiles or from pending orders. Ca 300k have reached Ukraine under this track\n\n**Track 2**:  Joint procurement of initially 155mm ammunition (European Defense Agency). This is the initiative to collaborate between corporations and nations to shorten lead times and streamline the supply chains.  25 nations signed and 8 large contracts for ammunition have been made with defense industry. It's under this track that the \"one mil rounds in one year\" where promised, which failed. The track is by no means dead though, and remains the most important initiative to supply Ukraine with weapon platforms, ammunition and missiles long-term.\n\n**Track 3**: Ramp up capacity in the European defense industry (Act in Support of Ammunition Production). An EU fund for European defense industry to draw means to invest in more production capacity. Applications opened in October -23 and by April -24 the fund will have selected up to 20 projects to support.\n\nTrack 3 is, as far as i understand, intended for smaller actors that have a product that they can make and Ukraine needs, but they lack the means to initiate or increase production. Track two is the big one where massive collective orders are being made, that allows the defense industry the security and longevity required to invest in new production facilities and infrastructure.",

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6v2DwEPVWU) then watch [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4J3C14-fq4).\n\nSo unfortunately for the skilled workers in video 1, Pakistan has shit labour regulations and no unions (because dictatorships), so they are producing steel rebar the way grandpa did, with rollers, and it's dangerous and slow. \n\nIn video 2, that's a plant in South Korea, that has modern safety standards, and modern automation. One thing you'll notice is that if your workers aren't constantly getting maimed by your dogshit workplace, they get better at their jobs and think up process improvements. Another thing you'll notice is that the quantity of output is simply incomparable. \n\nIf you didn't have freight costs, you literally could not pay the guys in Pakistan little enough to make up for how much more efficient it is to be running a modern factory. You see all those charts of worker productivity going up since 1900 - this is what it looks like. If you build a factory with modern labour, enviromental, and safety laws, it absolutely produces more and faster than ever before.\n\nSo if you imagine a shell factory in WW1 britain is like video 1: skilled workers, working with machine tools - probably a bit worse, because they would be belt-fed back then - you would imagine that making the parts of a shell today is lots of factories like video 2. Except, that's not what's happening. I have seen one video from a US manufacturer of 155mm, and it had some modern stuff, but it was also pretty obviously a factory geared to making small batches. My guess is guys like that are just being asked to produce more, and that's obviously taking ages and not working very well.",

One thing you&#39;ll notice is that if your workers aren&#39;t constantly getting maimed by your dogshit workplace, they get better at their jobs and think up process improvements. Another thing you&#39;ll notice is that the quantity of output is simply incomparable. </p>\n\n<p>If you didn&#39;t have freight costs, you literally could not pay the guys in Pakistan little enough to make up for how much more efficient it is to be running a modern factory.

Israel, under increasing international pressure to prove those claims, has released several videos to press its case, showing elements of its cautious exploration of underground structures the military identifies as Hamas tunnels. The videos so far \u2014 including those released on Wednesday \u2014 have not shown conclusive evidence of a vast network of tunnels.\nOne video released this month included a military spokesman showing weapons that he said were found at Al-Shifa. Another showed a section of a tunnel that The New York Times verified was recorded at Al-Shifa.\n\nThat tunnel resembled the one seen in a video released on Wednesday. In that video, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, is shown holding a flashlight as he and a group of soldiers traverse a tunnel with an arched ceiling that he describes as being underneath Al-Shifa\u2019s complex.\n\nThe videos released on Wednesday also show at least two toilets, a small alcove with a sink and a room with exposed wiring. Admiral Hagari says in the video that the room, and an electrical panel in another part of the tunnel, are connected to electricity sourced through the hospital.\n\nIn the video, the admiral also shows a room that he called a \u201chideout,\u201d with two cots and a wall-mounted air-conditioning unit that he says is connected to an engine outside a hospital building.\n\nThe Israeli military said that Hamas had likely emptied the rooms as Israeli forces advanced.  Admiral Hagari says in the video that Hamas tried to seal and destroy portions of the tunnel ahead of the military\u2019s arrival.\n\nIn another video released on Wednesday, Admiral Hagari enters a home that he says is near Al-Shifa\u2019s complex and served as a classroom. Inside the house, which has a chalkboard with English writing on it, Admiral Hagari shows an entrance into a tunnel that he says connected to tunnels under Al-Shifa.\n\n[American journalist in the tunnel](https://youtu.be/_Trd8YguYHQ)",

Israel applies divide and conquer to weaken its opponents (terror orgs since the 60s-70s)\n\n2. *Some* of those efforts *somehow* strengthened organizations that turned into Hamas\n\n3. Three-four decades later, after ongoing efforts from both sides to both initiate peace and to destroy each other, Hamas executes one of the largest terror attacks in history\n\n4. Israel invades Gaza to root out Hamas and will eat a lot of shit doing that and after.\n\nYour response to this is if you play with fire you get burnt?\n\nYou think, if Israel hadn't tried divide and conquer,  Gaza would be swell right now? The PLO would have remained the sole Palestinian entity,  and maybe even finally signed a peace treaty? Iran and others would not have instigated anything or straight up create other terror orgs?

Do &quot;defnese/patrol/security helicopters&quot; make any sense for the future?), I see a use of these and wouldnt count them out if they actually perform as advartised/expected, which is kind of a middle sized If.</p>\n\n<p>They can even operate as a screening for the KA-s, same like the US vision of the &quot;body system&quot; (I think) for their new gen air force. I might be stretching it a bit on the organisational capabilities, but it should be possible.</p>\n\n<p>Am I just seeing things and absolutley wrong? (My knowledge related to military air operations is near zero, so please consider that when you read my ideas. I am in no way a trained/experienced someone on this matter)</p>\n</div>",
