That prompted multiple US delegations since 2020 to fly to Tokyo to warn Japan, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified discussing the sensitive matter.\n\n>Still, the US saw insufficient evidence Japan was taking action to secure its networks despite warning of a problem, said a former intelligence official. General Paul Nakasone, director of the National Security Agency and commander of US Cyber Command, was among US officials who visited Tokyo to flag the issue.\n\n>**But Japan wanted proof of the infiltration, said the former official, who added that intelligence is sometimes too sensitive to share specifics.** Japan also was reluctant to let the US into its networks, the former official said.\n\n>Only after Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, visited Japan in mid-November 2021 did the US and Japan chart a successful way forward, according to the officials. Japan has since set about boosting its cybersecurity defenses, although the US is eager to see it do still more, according to statements from both countries this year, in addition to national security experts.\n\n>The breach and the US warnings were reported earlier by the Washington Post, which cited multiple current and former US and Japanese officials it didn\u2019t identify.\n\n>>\u2018Not Confirmed\u2019\n\n>Yasukazu Hamada, Japan\u2019s defense minister, declined to comment on the Washington Post report, telling reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that it doesn\u2019t comment on individual cyberattacks and how they are handled.\n\n>\u201cI won\u2019t comment on the details due to the nature of the matter,\u201d Hamada said. \u201cWe have not confirmed that classified information held by the Defense Ministry has been leaked due to a cyberattack.\u201d The Embassy of Japan in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages requesting comment.\n\n>Tensions between the US and China are increasing due in part to concerns of a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which would likely be accompanied by cyberattacks, particularly in the early stages.\n\n>In 2019, the US and Japan agreed that a cyberattack against either country in Japan could, in certain circumstances, constitute an armed attack. The US has about 56,000 troops based in Japan, according to the US Defense Department.\n\n>In August 2021, Yasuhide Nakayama, who was then Japan\u2019s state minister of defense, said he and Nakasone were \u201copening a new chapter in our joint efforts in cyberspace\u201d as part of a visit to US Cyber Command to discuss security challenges in cyberspace and bilateral cooperation, according to US Cyber Command.\n\n>Japan established a Cyber Defense Group in 2014, as part of its Self-Defense Forces. But amid a growing spate of cyberattacks, it reorganized and launched a full cyber defense command in March 2022, along with a commitment to engage in offensive cyber operations and plans to expand to 4,000 people by the end of 2027, according to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defense.\n\n>In addition to visits to Japan by both Nakasone and Neuberger, then National Cyber Director Chris Inglis also visited Japan in December 2022.\n\n>In a statement provided to Bloomberg News, the US Defense Department described the US-Japan Alliance as the cornerstone of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and said it was strengthening cyber cooperation as part of \u201cAlliance modernization efforts\u201d.\n\n>In January, the US and Japan agreed to \u201cintensify collaboration to counter increasingly sophisticated and persistent cyber threats\u201d following security talks to strengthen the alliance in Washington DC.\n\n>\u201cThe United States welcomed Japan\u2019s initiatives to bolster its national cybersecurity posture,\u201d said a joint statement, citing the creation of a new organization to coordinate whole-of-government cybersecurity policies and a new framework set to \u201cprovide a foundation for a wider range of US-Japan cooperation.\u201d",

At the same time, there are fewer and fewer reserves because of the need for troops on the Southern front.

The attack devastated the city of Pokrovsk, which lies about 43 miles to the northwest of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk and 30 miles from the front line.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Tuesday that targeting the rescue workers was a \u201cdeliberate decision\u201d by the Russians \u201cto cause the greatest pain and damage.\u201d\n\nAfter the second attack, the search for survivors was suspended overnight out of concern that there could be additional strikes on rescuers, according to Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine\u2019s minister of internal affairs. At least 12 multistory buildings, including a hotel, a prosecutor\u2019s office, a pharmacy, shops and two cafes, were damaged, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nBy the time the rescue operations were complete on Tuesday, 122 tons of rubble had been removed from the city center, Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said.\n\nPhotos of the wreckage showed a five-story building with a chunk of the top floor missing and many of its window frames badly warped.

The attack devastated the city of Pokrovsk, which lies about 43 miles to the northwest of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk and 30 miles from the front line.</p>\n\n<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Tuesday that targeting the rescue workers was a \u201cdeliberate decision\u201d by the Russians \u201cto cause the greatest pain and damage.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>After the second attack, the search for survivors was suspended overnight out of concern that there could be additional strikes on rescuers, according to Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine\u2019s minister of internal affairs. At least 12 multistory buildings, including a hotel, a prosecutor\u2019s office, a pharmacy, shops and two cafes, were damaged, Ukrainian officials said.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the rescue operations were complete on Tuesday, 122 tons of rubble had been removed from the city center, Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said.</p>\n\n<p>Photos of the wreckage showed a five-story building with a chunk of the top floor missing and many of its window frames badly warped. Debris littered a children\u2019s playground.

It will be interesting if Ukraine further chooses to \"bring the war\" to Russia by seriously drone striking civilians, not just 1 or 2 lone drone strikes but a concerted effort of waves of drones designed to kill Russian civilians and emergency personnel, and they will be arguably justified in doing so since Russia is the aggressor.

At worst, they are mirroring Russian actions, and unlike Russia, Ukraine is fighting for their existence as a nation. Ukraine killing 30 Russian civilians here and there in apartment drone strikes with the aim of ending the war is completely understandable in comparison to the tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians that have died to Russian missile strikes and artillery.

As far as I know, the vast majority of the soldiers are mobilized men from the Odesa Oblast. In the 38th Brigade there are officers from the 503rd Marine Battalion who were taken prisoner in Mariupol, freed and now the battalion is part of this brigade. Nice to read that it had a good start. The performance of the 37th wasn't that stellar, but nevertheless they are continuing to attrite the Russians at Novodonetske (funnily enough, from the Russian 37th Motorized Brigade) - in my opinion it won't be long before the latters will have to withdraw to Kermenchyk. It has to be said that the Ukrainian marines are average mechanized infantry for all intents and purposes, not an elite corps (I wouldn't be surprised if a chunk of the enlisted don't know how to swim, but then again it's not even something that's that necessary for the areas they fight in).\n\nP.S. The point about the new brigade being withdrawn due to losses is interesting. My money on the 23rd Mechanized.

In this war, the Kremlin has provided the guns, and I believe the Russian Orthodox Church is providing the ideas,\u201d states Archimandrite Cyril Hovorun, an Orthodox priest and theologian who in the 2000s worked in the central offices of the Moscow Patriarchate and is now a professor at Loyola Marymount University in California.\n\nThe support of the Russian Orthodox Church has grown as the invasion of Ukraine has progressed, with Patriarch Kirill becoming one of the war\u2019s most prominent promoters. In his sermons, he has accused \u201cforeign forces\u201d of trying to divide Russia and Ukraine, which he often describes as \u201cone people.\u201d These thinly veiled attempts to blame the war on the Western world while denying Ukraine\u2019s right to an independent national identity closely echo the Kremlin\u2019s own imperialistic talking points.\n\nPatriarch Kirill has continued to defend the invasion despite mounting evidence of Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine. He has remained unmoved by the atrocities uncovered in liberated towns such as Bucha, or the seemingly endless accounts of mass killings, sexual violence, torture chambers, child abductions, and forced deportations throughout Russian-occupied Ukraine. He is silent regarding the constant missile and drone assaults against civilian targets including homes, apartment buildings, shopping centers, churches, hospitals, schools, and grain storage facilities.\n\nWhile Patriarch Kirill\u2019s efforts to justify the invasion of Ukraine have garnered considerable international attention, his stance is far from exceptional and appears to be broadly representative of the mood in today\u2019s Russia. Indeed, Russian aggression against Ukraine is not the result of plans determined by President Putin alone; nor is Patriarch Kirill the only establishment figure to publicly back the invasion. On the contrary, levels of support, or at least acquiescence, among the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian society as a whole remain scandalously high.\n\nNot one of the approximately 400 Russian Orthodox Church bishops in Russia has spoken out against the war. The Russian Orthodox Church clergy is a huge body including more than 40,000 full-time clerics, priests, and deacons internationally. Only approximately 300 members of the clergy signed a joint public statement criticizing the war, with many of the signatories based outside of Russia. Moreover, 700 university rectors have signed a public statement supporting the war.\n\nRussian theologian Sergei Chapnin, who formerly served as deputy editor-in-chief of the Moscow Patriarchate Publishing House and is now based at the Orthodox Christian Study Center of Fordham University, has been highly critical of what he sees as the hypocrisy of the Russian Orthodox Church bishops. In an open letter published in February 2023, he reproached them for being \u201cembittered castle-builders swilling the cocktail of imperial myth, resentment, and unbelievably primitive eschatology. You stand by a man [Patriarch Kirill] who justifies war crimes and has betrayed the Church. You repeat his words, retell his criminal arguments.\u201d\n\nIn a January 2023 sermon, Patriarch Kirill predicted the Russian invasion would leave the Russian Orthodox Church triumphant in Ukraine and warned: \u201cthere will be no trace left of the schismatics because they are fulfilling the devil\u2019s evil bidding of eroding Orthodoxy on Kyivan land.\u201d This chilling prophesy is unlikely to be fulfilled.

Connectivity modules are typically controlled remotely and are the necessary link between the device and the internet.\n\nRecent events demonstrate the power of these small modules. Last year, Russia stole $5 million worth of farm equipment from a John Deere dealership in Ukraine and attempted to bring it back to Russia. Luckily, that equipment was embedded with Western-made connectivity modules. Because the modules can be controlled remotely and the vehicles require internet connectivity to operate, remotely shutting down the module allows the module provider to shut the vehicle down. When Russia moved the stolen John Deere vehicles across the border into Russia, the modules were disabled\u2014shutting down the equipment and effectively turning the vehicles into bricks.\u00a0\n\nConnectivity modules are used in a wide variety of devices throughout the U.S., from consumer \u2018smart devices\u2019, to electric cars, to U.S. telecom networks regulated by the FCC. Serving as the link between the device and the internet, these modules have the capacity both to brick the device and to access the data flowing from the device to the web server that runs each device. As a result, if the CCP can control the module, it may be able to effectively exfiltrate data or shut down the IoT device. This raises particularly grave concerns in the context of critical infrastructure and any type of sensitive data.\n\nIndeed, the CCP is well aware of the importance of IoT modules. It has given extensive state support to its cellular IoT industry, led by Quectel and Fibocom. Quectel provides modules to leading international firms. They are used in smart cities, drones, and U.S. first responder body cameras. Fibocom, meanwhile, targets individual collaborations with major tech players.\n\nPRC law requires companies to comply with the Party\u2019s commands, including requests for data whether it is stored in the PRC or elsewhere. In addition, observers have expressed concerns that both companies are closely integrated into the PRC military and state security. Fibocom even states on its website that people using Fibocom\u2019s Platform \u201cshall comply with\u2026the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d which implies that Americans using a device with a Fibocom module can be surveilled pursuant to PRC law.\n\nUnder your leadership, the FCC has taken important steps to counter the nefarious influence of CCP-controlled technology in U.S. telecom networks, including adding equipment and services to the Covered List from companies such as Huawei, ZTE, and Hikvision, among others. Luckily, unlike in the Huawei case, there are still many U.S. and allied firms that compete with PRC cellular IoT module providers\u2014such that restricting Quectel and Fibocom\u2019s access to the U.S. market would not undermine U.S. telecommunications networks.\n\nTackling PRC cellular IoT modules is a natural next step for the FCC, in consultation with appropriate national security agencies. For one, Quectel and Fibocom supply companies whose equipment is already on the FCC\u2019s Covered List. The equipment on this list poses a national security threat to the U.S. and may not receive authorization for importation or sale in the U.S. Similar scrutiny should be considered for any PRC cellular IoT modules in this equipment.\n\nWe respectfully request information on the PRC IoT threat. Please respond to the following questions by August 21, 2023.\n\n\u2022 Is the FCC, or other agencies with which it collaborates on national security issues, able to track the presence of Quectel, Fibocom, and other cellular IoT modules provided by PRC-based companies in the U.S.? Can the FCC provide further information about these modules in U.S. networks?\n\n\u2022 Does the FCC share our concerns about the presence of PRC cellular IoT modules in U.S. networks?\n\n\u2022 Is the FCC considering using the Covered List to tackle PRC cellular IoT modules?\u00a0Could requiring certification for modules used in communications equipment be an effective means of countering PRC cellular IoT modules in U.S. networks? What other potential solutions exist in the view of the FCC?\n\n\u2022 Does the FCC require or desire further statutory authorities to combat the threat that PRC cellular IoT modules pose?\n\nThe House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party has broad authority to \u201cinvestigate and submit policy recommendations on the status of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s economic, technological, and security progress and its competition with the United States\u201d under H.

US, Israel, and USSR all operated Modern system armies that focused on maneuver warfare where gas would not be useful. They also had maneuver focused warfare in WW2 as well, which is again why gas wasn't used. It cannot be emphasized enough the reason why gas was ditched was because of maneuver. \n\nNo, it was not ditched solely because of manuever otherwise there were multiple situations it would have seen use during WW2. Gas was ditched because it wasn't effective at breaking the stalemate. For casualties they're subpar with even the best performer, mustard gas, only causinh 2-3% of hospitalized casualties to die. Just to sufficiently saturate 50 square kilometers of a front with Sarin gas you'd need 15,000 155mm shells which I'll remind you was Russia's peak fire rate during the war. They're no longer hitting that number because they're manufacturing isn't keeping up.\n\n>We've already seen both sides employ gas grenades at the tactical level, and Russia has been more willing to use gas/incendiary weapons. Because we're entering a static conflict where gas makes more and more sense. \n\nAnd from this we get to the large scale production necessary to use these weapons the way you're describing how?\n\n>Both sides are probably highly vulnerable to large scale gas attacks, if anyone built up enough stockpile to do it. I'll grant you it would take a large amount of artillery shells to do, which makes it unlikely to be employed at the strategic level (at least for this year). But there's also massive and plentiful amounts of tactically deployable gas canisters on the world market for riot control.

        "body": "[Exclusive: North Korean hackers breached top Russian missile maker](https://www.reuters.com/technology/north-korean-hackers-breached-top-russian-missile-maker-2023-08-07/)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nAn elite group of North Korean hackers secretly breached computer networks at a major Russian missile developer for at least five months last year, according to technical evidence reviewed by Reuters and analysis by security researchers.\n\nReuters found cyber-espionage teams linked to the North Korean government, which security researchers call ScarCruft and Lazarus, secretly installed stealthy digital backdoors into systems at NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a rocket design bureau based in Reutov, a small town on the outskirts of Moscow.\n\nReuters could not determine whether any data was taken during the intrusion or what information may have been viewed. In the months following the digital break-in Pyongyang announced several developments in its banned ballistic missile programme but it is not clear if this was related to the breach.\n\nExperts say the incident shows how the isolated country will even target its allies, such as Russia, in a bid to acquire critical technologies.\n\nNPO Mashinostroyeniya did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment. Russia's embassy in Washington did not respond to an emailed request for comment. North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNews of the hack comes shortly after a trip to Pyongyang last month by Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu for the 70th anniversary of the Korean War; the first visit by a Russian defence minister to North Korea since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe targeted company, commonly known as NPO Mash, has acted as a pioneer developer of hypersonic missiles, satellite technologies and newer generation ballistic armaments, according to missile experts \u2013 three areas of keen interest to North Korea since it embarked on its mission to create an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of striking the mainland United States.\n\nAccording to technical data, the intrusion roughly began in late 2021 and continued until May 2022 when, according to internal communications at the company reviewed by Reuters, IT engineers detected the hackers' activity.\n\nNPO Mash grew to prominence during the Cold War as a premier satellite maker for Russia's space programme and as a provider of cruise missiles.\n\nEMAIL HACK\n\nThe hackers dug into the company's IT environment, giving them the ability to read email traffic, jump between networks, and extract data, according to Tom Hegel, a security researcher with U.S. cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, who initially discovered the compromise.\n\n\"These findings provide rare insight into the clandestine cyber operations that traditionally remain concealed from public scrutiny or are simply never caught by such victims,\" Hegel said.\n\nHegel's team of security analysts at SentinelOne learned of the hack after discovering that an NPO Mash IT staffer accidentally leaked his company's internal communications while attempting to investigate the North Korean attack by uploading evidence to a private portal used by cybersecurity researchers worldwide.\n\nWhen contacted by Reuters, that IT staffer declined to comment.\n\nThe lapse provided Reuters and SentinelOne with a unique snapshot into a company of critical importance to the Russian state which was sanctioned by the Obama administration following the invasion of Crimea.\n\nTwo independent computer security experts, Nicholas Weaver and Matt Tait, reviewed the exposed email content and confirmed its authenticity. The analysts verified the connection by checking the email's cryptographic signatures against a set of keys controlled by NPO Mash.\n\n\"I'm highly confident the data's authentic,\" Weaver told Reuters. \"How the information was exposed was an absolutely hilarious screwup\".\n\nSentinelOne said they were confident North Korea was behind the hack because the cyber spies re-used previously known malware and malicious infrastructure set up to carry out other intrusions.\n\n'MOVIE STUFF'\n\nIn 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin touted NPO Mash's \"Zircon\" hypersonic missile as a \"promising new product\", capable of travelling at around nine times the speed of sound.\n\nThe fact North Korean hackers may have obtained information about the Zircon does not mean they would immediately have that same capability, said Markus Schiller, a Europe-based missile expert who has researched foreign aid to North Korea's missile programme.\n\n\"That's movie stuff,\" he said. \"Getting plans won't help you much in building these things, there is a lot more to it than some drawings\".\n\nHowever, given NPO Mash's position as a top Russian missile designer and producer, the company would be a valuable target, Schiller added.\n\n\"There is much to learn from them,\" he said.\n\nAnother area of interest could be in the manufacturing process used by NPO Mash surrounding fuel, experts said.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/north-korean-hackers-breached-top-russian-missile-maker-2023-08-07/\">Exclusive: North Korean hackers breached top Russian missile maker</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>An elite group of North Korean hackers secretly breached computer networks at a major Russian missile developer for at least five months last year, according to technical evidence reviewed by Reuters and analysis by security researchers.</p>\n\n<p>Reuters found cyber-espionage teams linked to the North Korean government, which security researchers call ScarCruft and Lazarus, secretly installed stealthy digital backdoors into systems at NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a rocket design bureau based in Reutov, a small town on the outskirts of Moscow.</p>\n\n<p>Reuters could not determine whether any data was taken during the intrusion or what information may have been viewed. In the months following the digital break-in Pyongyang announced several developments in its banned ballistic missile programme but it is not clear if this was related to the breach.</p>\n\n<p>Experts say the incident shows how the isolated country will even target its allies, such as Russia, in a bid to acquire critical technologies.</p>\n\n<p>NPO Mashinostroyeniya did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment. Russia&#39;s embassy in Washington did not respond to an emailed request for comment. North Korea&#39;s mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>News of the hack comes shortly after a trip to Pyongyang last month by Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu for the 70th anniversary of the Korean War; the first visit by a Russian defence minister to North Korea since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>\n\n<p>The targeted company, commonly known as NPO Mash, has acted as a pioneer developer of hypersonic missiles, satellite technologies and newer generation ballistic armaments, according to missile experts \u2013 three areas of keen interest to North Korea since it embarked on its mission to create an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of striking the mainland United States.</p>\n\n<p>According to technical data, the intrusion roughly began in late 2021 and continued until May 2022 when, according to internal communications at the company reviewed by Reuters, IT engineers detected the hackers&#39; activity.</p>\n\n<p>NPO Mash grew to prominence during the Cold War as a premier satellite maker for Russia&#39;s space programme and as a provider of cruise missiles.</p>\n\n<p>EMAIL HACK</p>\n\n<p>The hackers dug into the company&#39;s IT environment, giving them the ability to read email traffic, jump between networks, and extract data, according to Tom Hegel, a security researcher with U.S. cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, who initially discovered the compromise.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;These findings provide rare insight into the clandestine cyber operations that traditionally remain concealed from public scrutiny or are simply never caught by such victims,&quot; Hegel said.</p>\n\n<p>Hegel&#39;s team of security analysts at SentinelOne learned of the hack after discovering that an NPO Mash IT staffer accidentally leaked his company&#39;s internal communications while attempting to investigate the North Korean attack by uploading evidence to a private portal used by cybersecurity researchers worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>When contacted by Reuters, that IT staffer declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>The lapse provided Reuters and SentinelOne with a unique snapshot into a company of critical importance to the Russian state which was sanctioned by the Obama administration following the invasion of Crimea.</p>\n\n<p>Two independent computer security experts, Nicholas Weaver and Matt Tait, reviewed the exposed email content and confirmed its authenticity. The analysts verified the connection by checking the email&#39;s cryptographic signatures against a set of keys controlled by NPO Mash.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m highly confident the data&#39;s authentic,&quot; Weaver told Reuters. &quot;How the information was exposed was an absolutely hilarious screwup&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>SentinelOne said they were confident North Korea was behind the hack because the cyber spies re-used previously known malware and malicious infrastructure set up to carry out other intrusions.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;MOVIE STUFF&#39;</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin touted NPO Mash&#39;s &quot;Zircon&quot; hypersonic missile as a &quot;promising new product&quot;, capable of travelling at around nine times the speed of sound.</p>\n\n<p>The fact North Korean hackers may have obtained information about the Zircon does not mean they would immediately have that same capability, said Markus Schiller, a Europe-based missile expert who has researched foreign aid to North Korea&#39;s missile programme.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s movie stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;Getting plans won&#39;t help you much in building these things, there is a lot more to it than some drawings&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>However, given NPO Mash&#39;s position as a top Russian missile designer and producer, the company would be a valuable target, Schiller added.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There is much to learn from them,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>Another area of interest could be in the manufacturing process used by NPO Mash surrounding fuel, experts said. Last month, North Korea test-launched the Hwasong-18, the first of its ICBMs to use solid propellants.</p>\n\n<p>That fuelling method can allow for faster deployment of missiles during war, because it does not require fuelling on a launchpad, making the missiles harder to track and destroy before blast-off.</p>\n\n<p>NPO Mash produces an ICBM dubbed the SS-19 which is fuelled in the factory and sealed shut, a process known as &quot;ampulisation&quot; that yields a similar strategic result.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to do because rocket propellant, especially the oxidiser, is very corrosive,&quot; said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;North Korea announced that it was doing the same thing in late 2021. If NPO Mash had one useful thing for them, that would be top of my list,&quot; he added.</p>\n</div>",

It also denounces western sanctions, describing them as worse than Napoleon, who marched on Russia in 1812.\n\nThe new history book also states that the \u201cmain goal\u201d of the west is to \u201cdestabilise the situation inside Russia\u201d, and casts Moscow as a victim of western aggression fighting for its very existence.\n\nWhen describing the origins of the war in Ukraine, the book cites Putin, who has repeatedly claimed the invasion of Ukraine war started in order to \u201cend the fighting started by the west\u201d. The history book also describes Ukraine as an \u201cartificial state\u201d, parroting Putin\u2019s long essay On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, which states that \u201cRussia was robbed, indeed\u201d when Ukraine gained independence in 1991.\n\nPresidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who is known for his conservative view of history and has been criticised by some historians, praised the speedy production of the book. \u201cNo textbook has ever been created in our country in such a short time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe authors wrote it practically with their own hand.\u201d He added that the textbook presents \u201cthe state\u2019s point of view\u201d.\n\nMedinsky appeared to boast that the book rewrote past history. \u201cWe completely rewrote the sections \u201870s\u2019, \u201880s\u2019, \u201890s\u2019 and \u20182000s\u2019. A new section has been added from 2014 to the present, including the special military operation,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia has unleashed an unprecedented crackdown on dissent during its Ukraine offensive, which has extended into education.\n\nIn April, a Russian girl was taken away from her father after she drew a picture in support of Ukraine at school.\n\nA Russian court also sentenced a former history teacher to five and a half years in prison for referring criticising the war online.\n\nAfter the start of the Ukraine operation, a new subject \u2013 \u201cConversations about important things\u201d \u2013 was introduced in Russian schools, meant to instil patriotism in children.\n\nThe subject included the need for students as young as eight to understand that loving one\u2019s country means a readiness to \u201cbear arms in its defence\u201d in dangerous times.\n\nThere has also seen an exodus from Russia of prominent historians and philosophers who disagree with the war in Ukraine.\n\nAleksei, a former history teacher at an elite school outside Moscow who quit last April after a disagreement with management over the new \u201cpatriotic\u201d curriculum, described the new history textbooks as \u201ctotal fiction\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are rewriting both the past and the present,\u201d Aleksei told the Guardian, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cI worry for the children that will be brought up by lies.\u201d",

                "body": ">Ukraine is in much better shape than it was back in May-July 2022 when Russian artillery dominance was unrivaled, inflicting massive casualties on Ukrainian forces\n\nAre you saying they had higher casualties back then? I agree that in terms of material available it was much worse, they have much more stuff now.\n\nI'm not sure about manpower though, it's going to be nearly impossible to count. For Ukraine I've lately been looking at the number of times the Hero of Ukraine has been awarded. Obviously one has to keep in mind that it has been awarded for political reasons in the past(before the invasion, but especially before 2014), but if you look at the 2022 and 2023 timeline it roughly maps with periods of intense fighting being reported in the news being the time with the most awards.\n\nNot sure when we start counting the summer offensive to be in full swing, but if you start counting from June onwards when the first leopard was lost then there's been ~54 awards given since then. From February to June it was ~24 awards. That's for 2023.\n\nSomewhat arbitrary point to choose, but starting from May 2022 until the end of the year there were roughly ~57 awards given. I think choosing May as a starting point for comparison makes sense, since February-march-april have very high % of awards being given posthumously; which maps with the time Ukraine was on the defense and was losing a lot of people. Obviously if you put that point up to late july when the first major Ukrainian offensive started, the number of awards is even lower. But I think May is a better comparison point because it illustrates that the casualty rates really are high right now. \n\nAnother point to make is that looking at recent awards from the time of this summer offensive, they are overwhelmingly noted as being awarded posthumously; not the case for 2022; where I'd say it's about 30-40% posthumously.\n\nedit: for 2022, the 30-40% number is for May onwards to be clear, there are a lot more awards given posthumously in february-march-april.",

[The U.S. Department of Commerce conducted an audit of ASML's EUV machine but found that it did not meet the 25% threshold (U.S.-made components did not constitute more than 25% of the value of the machine)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight-idCAKBN1Z50HN). The 25%+ threshold would have allowed the blocking of its export under the laws or trade agreements in place at the time. They had to get the Dutch government to block the sale.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong. Do you have a source for your claim that ASML's EUV couldn't be exported to China because of US tech? I'll go ahead and admit right away that I don't have a source to back my claim that Trump's threats to withdraw from NATO had an impact on the Dutch government blocking the EUV sale.

These precision munitions have not been given to Ukraine in anything other than token numbers. The weapons we are giving to Ukraine (predominately shells) are going to be of limited use in a war with China as there just aren\u2019t going to be massive land battles. The air defense theory makes sense on a surface level as the US has publicly stated that we don\u2019t have the numbers of patriot batteries needed for us and our Allies and that manufacturing rates of interceptors has not kept up. This ignores two very important facts. First the missiles sent to Ukraine are majority older from US stockpiles, these are far less capable of engaging Chinese missiles than the newer variants and are approaching their expiration date anyway, and two real world experience for these systems is extremely valuable as it allows engineers to improve the design of future missiles and radar systems, so for a future conflict with China expending a hypothetical 5% of missile stocks to get a 15% improvement it interception rate is a fantastic deal. And the US needs to step up product these systems and missiles regardless so the small numbers of missiles given to Ukraine will not be significant in any future pacific war. The last point that is often brought up is that these systems could be given to Taiwan, this argument forgets that supply of Taiwan during a war would be nearly impossible so any concerted effort to arm them would need to be done before a war starts. Where is the political will to do this? The same politicians saying we need these shells for Taiwan don\u2019t want to put US troops on Taiwan or give them massive amounts of aid.",

The air defense theory makes sense on a surface level as the US has publicly stated that we don\u2019t have the numbers of patriot batteries needed for us and our Allies and that manufacturing rates of interceptors has not kept up. This ignores two very important facts. First the missiles sent to Ukraine are majority older from US stockpiles, these are far less capable of engaging Chinese missiles than the newer variants and are approaching their expiration date anyway, and two real world experience for these systems is extremely valuable as it allows engineers to improve the design of future missiles and radar systems, so for a future conflict with China expending a hypothetical 5% of missile stocks to get a 15% improvement it interception rate is a fantastic deal. And the US needs to step up product these systems and missiles regardless so the small numbers of missiles given to Ukraine will not be significant in any future pacific war. The last point that is often brought up is that these systems could be given to Taiwan, this argument forgets that supply of Taiwan during a war would be nearly impossible so any concerted effort to arm them would need to be done before a war starts. Where is the political will to do this? The same politicians saying we need these shells for Taiwan don\u2019t want to put US troops on Taiwan or give them massive amounts of aid.</p>\n</div>",

For whatever reason they have difficulty with coordinating units above the company level, and therefore lack the means to conduct breeching operations to sufficiently force a breakthrough anywhere on Russia defensive lines. That all makes sense. What I don't understand, and this may seem profoundly ignorant, is if WW2 armies with inferior communications and a less educated population base to work from could do it, why can't Ukraine? The Red Army officer corps was hammered with purges, horrendous casualties at the start of the war, and was greatly expanded in size, yet they made huge mechanized advances moving entire army groups. I have a hard time believing the average Ukrainian officer should be worse than a Soviet one, yet they struggle to move more than a few battalions at a time?

Now, will fusion energy to the grid take that 40% out completely? Obviously not, oil has a million different uses. But it would still be a drastic change. In turn, that would mean changes in the importance of some of the world's most critical shipping lanes (Strait of Hormuz, for example,) which would then reduce the bargaining power of many countries. Additionally, think of a China unburdened by energy constraints. Will international trade be sufficient to keep it in check? Hard to say.

Now, will fusion energy to the grid take that 40% out completely? Obviously not, oil has a million different uses. But it would still be a drastic change. In turn, that would mean changes in the importance of some of the world&#39;s most critical shipping lanes (Strait of Hormuz, for example,) which would then reduce the bargaining power of many countries. Additionally, think of a China unburdened by energy constraints. Will international trade be sufficient to keep it in check? Hard to say.

What does that mean? Oil refiners produce a range of products, including gasoline. Where solar, wind and geothermal can replace coal for power generation, they will. But for wider use cases, other products, like jet fuel and diesel, are very much dependent on gasoline.

Based on what I'm seeing from Janes as recently as January of this year, testing is ongoing in Arctic waters and batches of weapons for Poseidon have been built.
