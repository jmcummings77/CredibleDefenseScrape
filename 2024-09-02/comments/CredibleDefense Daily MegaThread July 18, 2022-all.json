I think this is how Ukraine wants it until the new brigades in training are ready and the counterattack kicks off.

That was a message to Ukraine, Zelensky in particular, that Biden was willing to talk openly but unofficially with the press to discuss his concerns, so they had better be heeded before those concerns are discussed publicly and officially. \n\nThat article, plus various behind closed doors discussions nobody talks about openly but we are assured are happening, are major reasons why the UA are having to rush a big counteroffensive against Kherson, despite not having recovered from their serious losses, still not having what they need/want from NATO, despite not having the manpower and resources to even stop the Russian Donbas offensive, despite not waiting for the Russians to even strategically culminate. Zelensky must commit the forces and achieve an offensive victory to prove to the West, Biden especially as the chief UA patron, that a military solution to retake Russian defended territory including a city is possible. \n\nAnd Kherson is the \"easiest\" target for a counteroffensive. It's the closest to Ukraine supply lines, the farthest from the Russian supply lines, the Russians are holding the far side of a river, the population HATES the Russians, and the Russians are focused on the Donbas in terms of manpower and supplies.\n\nAnd if I suspect that, then Putin does too. Which means despite Donbas being his strategic main effort, it's in his best interest to make the Kherson offensive as costly as possible to the UAF, even if it's equally damaging to Russia, because this will be a chance for him to erode Western support for Ukraine's ability to achieve a military solution in a timely manner. This could be a strategic victory for Russia even if they lose Kherson.\n\nWorst case scenario is the offensive fails but even Pyrrhic for the Ukrainians could cause more concerns and doubts about the UAF's offensive abilities. Then it means to get any results the US must wait at least until spring/summer 2023 for another counteroffensive, while committing far more financial and military aid well beyond what we've given up already. That is extremely unappealing considering the global economic and food crisis this war has caused. Which means it could cause a push for a negotiated settlement (which is almost surely the outcome anyway) where Putin is in the position of power to dictate terms. \n\nIn comparison, let's say the best case scenario happened and UAF takes the Kherson bridgehead with ease, with the Russians even refusing to fight. Then Russia looks like cowards, Putin loses face, and can't even contemplate negotiations unless he's willing for his rep to get treated like a bitch.",

Which means despite Donbas being his strategic main effort, it&#39;s in his best interest to make the Kherson offensive as costly as possible to the UAF, even if it&#39;s equally damaging to Russia, because this will be a chance for him to erode Western support for Ukraine&#39;s ability to achieve a military solution in a timely manner. This could be a strategic victory for Russia even if they lose Kherson.</p>\n\n<p>Worst case scenario is the offensive fails but even Pyrrhic for the Ukrainians could cause more concerns and doubts about the UAF&#39;s offensive abilities. Then it means to get any results the US must wait at least until spring/summer 2023 for another counteroffensive, while committing far more financial and military aid well beyond what we&#39;ve given up already. That is extremely unappealing considering the global economic and food crisis this war has caused. Which means it could cause a push for a negotiated settlement (which is almost surely the outcome anyway) where Putin is in the position of power to dictate terms. </p>\n\n<p>In comparison, let&#39;s say the best case scenario happened and UAF takes the Kherson bridgehead with ease, with the Russians even refusing to fight. Then Russia looks like cowards, Putin loses face, and can&#39;t even contemplate negotiations unless he&#39;s willing for his rep to get treated like a bitch.</p>\n</div>",

At the onset of the 2014 sanctions, and in three different U.S. administrations since, there was a clear and consistent view from the Treasury that any sanctions regime on Russia would take a while to produce results. \n\nBut the point that was often missed in these discussions, primarily because no one thought it would ever come to that, was that there was also a recognition that in an all-out war (not far from what we're witnessing now) that sanctions would actually have the **opposite** effect in the short-term. That Russia would receive a boost in its military capabilities. There were three broad-based reasons for this:\n\n1. An economic downturn would incentivize military enlistment as the jobless rate would increase, pushing younger males, especially from Russia's impoverished ethnic minority regions, to serve beyond their conscription period. We've seen examples of that. The part that the game-theory didn't perfectly account for is that Russia has been able to increase monetary incentives as well, so there are both push and pull factors in play at the moment, instead of the Treasury's view of only push factors. \n2. An increase in patriotism and grassroot support for the war efforts. We saw this in the U.S. after 9/11 and the swelling of U.S. military ranks with many choosing to serve due to a \"sense of duty.\" We can see evidence of that in the increase in support for Putin specifically reflected in some of the polls (as suspect as they are.) For the most part, however, there is little evidence from the sagging morale of Russian troops that there are many that want to be in a war of aggression against their neighbor. There are also other indicators, such as the increased reliance on Wagner forces that Kofman talked about a few days ago, which seems to indicate that this effect hasn't worked to the extent some would have expected. \n3. An onset of sanctions in previous regimes has always encouraged a rush towards getting last minute shipments accelerated and a boost in production in the near-term to build inventories. I think this is the area where there was higher confidence that everything from the Russian military industry complex to the shipping industry would increase output to blunt effects from the sanctions. Government spending as a percentage of GDP was also expected to surge early on. I think we've seen a lot of this happening. \n\nUltimately, the point is that we don't really know how strong the current sanctions packages have performed. Leading indicators were predicted to show more resilience upfront, and we're not long enough into this war for lagging indicators to reflect a true slowdown. But **some** of the criticism from certain quarters in the West, as well as the premature celebrations from the pro-Russians, misses the point that sanctioning a large country like Russia, with its natural gas trump card, is immensely difficult and results would take longer to show than sanctioning a country the size of Iran or NK.",

On some level, it makes sense given the system's advantages...but I also feel like Russia should have been more prepared for this thing on some level.\n\nEDIT: I put this in a reply to someone else, but [this](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-july-16) is likely relevant to my point.

I'm awfully skeptical that the raid was some underlings off on their own too - you'd have to be pretty stupid to miss the political dimensions of an attack like that, and to fail to see how you'd be risking dramatic consequences for Ukraine by going rogue like that.

Then after a couple weeks they'll start hitting stuff in Crimea. I imagine they'll be using all their Tochka's against Russian targets at this point, since they can use ATACMS against domestic targets.

That sort of situation means they're more vulnerable to be spotted and potentially engaged by the Russians, it means their ammo supply route stretching all the way to the Polish border has to be that much longer, and additionally, by having extended range a single HIMARS can control a much larger section of the front line then its umbrella is bigger, so less HIMARS are needed in one area.\n\nAn example of this would be Operational Command East, with its headquarters based in Dnipro it is responsible for the frontage from Kharkiv all the way to the edge of Kherson Oblast, so about 75% of the entire frontage for this war. Besides the JFO that's based in Donbas, OC-E is the only operational command, with only tactical commands, brigades and independent battalions, under it. Which means OC-E control the PGMs used in their operational area. For each of the sectors within OC-E where Russians are massed and their supply lines vulnerable, OC-E have to place their limited allotment of HIMARS and other domestic PGM systems relatively close to the front lines. \n\nSo, for M31 GMLRS to hit the Russian rear area beyond Kharkiv it needs to be close to Kharkiv, which means it can't support the Donbas too. Not so with ATACMS, which can be just east of Dnipro and cover much of OC-E. That means when OC-E gets intel on a target their kill chain is simplified and shortened. Not a big deal if they're going after immobile targets but very good if they are getting time sensitive targets like finding out about an ongoing Russian command meeting. \n\nAlso, ATACMS has a warhead 2.5x bigger than the M31 GMLRS, so when it strikes a target the effects will be bigger.

Try to negotiate a ceasefire using the current lines?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s unrealistic to think that Ukrainians would have any interest in current lines, so that&#39;s not an option. Retreating to February 24 lines is the likely result of defeat if the conflict continues, so that&#39;s sort of the bad case scenario. Retreating to 2014 lines is the worst case scenario if the conflict continues. It seems unlikely that Russia gains any substantial international goodwill from withdrawing from Ukraine, especially if current leadership remains in place, and probably even if current leadership leaves. Russia scared the hell out of Europe, and they&#39;re going to remain scared, destroying the multi-decade Russian effort to wins European hearts, minds, and energy dependence, Russia can&#39;t change that.</p>\n\n<p>So basically, the only way he can end the conflict is by losing it. That means he keeps going, and maybe he loses, but maybe the West stops supporting Ukraine and it turns into a win. Until he has a way to end the conflict that looks more attractive than the results of military defeat, he is going to keep fighting and see if circumstances change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree.

Even though only perhaps a fraction of NATO's weapons was used, the main thing that always repeats in NATO weaponry is: precision and surveillance. The \"stealth\" aspect will not be a thing in this war, but the precision strikes and the power of AWACS and satellite intel are clearly something to learn from, and are also a part of the stealth aspect almost wholly. \n\nThe possible lessons that the clearly reactive Russia might be learning from right now are, excluding \"be god damn proactive and it'll cost you much less than being reactive\":\n\n- Make HQs: more fluid, much more communication-secure, decentralized, motor-based, EWS-integrated(?) so they move in time when threatened, or just straight out decentralize your own army, adjusting everything else accordingly. \n\n- Invest in logistics, the machinery needed to load and unload, to make logistics much more flexible, much less centralized if you do not believe in your own AD\n\n- Anti-satellite weaponry is also a must and is something all of the aforementioned powers have been investing money and time into, but it is clear that Russia did not ever have a plan for dealing with precision strikes aside from using its AD, and probably never planned to wage a conventional war with NATO (given the half useless centralized humongous stockpiles of armor and ammunition that they would probably be almost too late to deploy, unless they'd rely on US-bound ship logistics sucking or getting sunk majorly, regardless its huge sitting duck ammo storages would've been definitely a subject to bombing campaigns). \n\nWhile I might sound like a captain obvious, we might be overestimating everyone, including ourselves (NATO), about how proactive the enemy is or how we are superior in every way possible to the enemy. Just one look at how it probably never crossed Russian generals' minds that HIMARS could be so destructive to its logistics and HQs is enough. They were possibly purely relying on AD while probably not even knowing how to identify HIMARS in the first place (per https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceskPbDtTzY). Even then, AD network is never 100% efficient, probably never will be, so decentralization of almost everything in the field is key, but goes against a lot of what Russia believes in on the battlefield.",

The &quot;stealth&quot; aspect will not be a thing in this war, but the precision strikes and the power of AWACS and satellite intel are clearly something to learn from, and are also a part of the stealth aspect almost wholly. </p>\n\n<p>The possible lessons that the clearly reactive Russia might be learning from right now are, excluding &quot;be god damn proactive and it&#39;ll cost you much less than being reactive&quot;:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Make HQs: more fluid, much more communication-secure, decentralized, motor-based, EWS-integrated(?) so they move in time when threatened, or just straight out decentralize your own army, adjusting everything else accordingly. </p></li>\n<li><p>Invest in logistics, the machinery needed to load and unload, to make logistics much more flexible, much less centralized if you do not believe in your own AD</p></li>\n<li><p>Anti-satellite weaponry is also a must and is something all of the aforementioned powers have been investing money and time into, but it is clear that Russia did not ever have a plan for dealing with precision strikes aside from using its AD, and probably never planned to wage a conventional war with NATO (given the half useless centralized humongous stockpiles of armor and ammunition that they would probably be almost too late to deploy, unless they&#39;d rely on US-bound ship logistics sucking or getting sunk majorly, regardless its huge sitting duck ammo storages would&#39;ve been definitely a subject to bombing campaigns). </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While I might sound like a captain obvious, we might be overestimating everyone, including ourselves (NATO), about how proactive the enemy is or how we are superior in every way possible to the enemy. Just one look at how it probably never crossed Russian generals&#39; minds that HIMARS could be so destructive to its logistics and HQs is enough. They were possibly purely relying on AD while probably not even knowing how to identify HIMARS in the first place (per <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceskPbDtTzY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceskPbDtTzY</a>). Even then, AD network is never 100% efficient, probably never will be, so decentralization of almost everything in the field is key, but goes against a lot of what Russia believes in on the battlefield.</p>\n</div>",
