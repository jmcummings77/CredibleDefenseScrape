As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The attack will likely still happen in some form, but the suggestion is that Iran may at least delay it and/or scale it back.\n\n>The Biden administration has in recent days worked through diplomatic channels, bringing in its Middle East allies to lobby Tehran to reconsider moving forward with a military attack on Israel. They\u2019ve warned Iran that a massive strike would only inflame tensions and risk a direct confrontation between the two countries, two senior U.S. officials said.\n\n>The administration has also urged Iran to rethink its reaction to the blast that killed Hamas leader ISMAIL HANIYEH, because his death appears to be the result of a remote-controlled bomb that had been placed in his Tehran guesthouse in a covert operation, rather than as part of a larger attack. Now, Tehran is increasingly on board with Washington\u2019s thinking, though it initially denied it, the officials said.

A very quick analysis: \n\n- The Kurks region has a NPP as well as the gas faucet through why Russian gas still flows to Europe. These are strategic objectives. \n- If Ukrainians manage to hold russian territory, they may push for land swaps, at least with the Kharkiv region. These areas are sparsely populated. Also, it makes it difficult fo russia to accept the end of the war at the current lines. \n- Russia may be forced to pull manpower back from the Donbass salient to avoid further penetration into Kursk. In a sense, this is from the Russian playbook which used Kharkiv as semi-effective diversion to push on the main line. \n- The main risks for Ukrainians are related to a Russian response. Putin may set an ultimatum along the lines \"leave our territory - or else\" and threaten to go nuclear, again.

Because comments focus on what will affect election chances versus defense topics, and there are plenty of subreddits to discuss that already.</p>\n\n<p>In this particular case, JD Vance isn&#39;t VP (yet/possibly never) so he doesn&#39;t have hypothetical increased influence over policy. Additionally, he is a Senator whose opinions are well known, as another commenter has helpfully posted a link to another discussion about his interview. </p>\n\n<p>As such, there&#39;s really nothing new to engage with on this topic, and doesn&#39;t pass. </p>\n\n<p>However, we&#39;ll leave it up as this type of thing will likely happen more frequently as November nears so hopefully an explanation helps limits the comments.</p>\n</div>",

You know, just in case.\n* Agreed with a blanket statement that  \n\n> The principals underscored the vital importance of all states being free to exercise rights and freedoms consistent with international law, as reflected in the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea, including freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea.  They reiterated their strong opposition to destabilizing or coercive unilateral actions in the maritime domain, including in the South China Sea and East China Sea, that increase tensions and undermine peace and stability.\n\n* then followed up with a very *not*-blanket statement before turning to other topics:\n\n> The principals expressed concern about China's excessive maritime claims in the South China Sea that are inconsistent with international law and unilateral actions to change the status quo by force or coercion.  They noted grave concern about China's dangerous and escalatory behavior toward Philippine vessels lawfully operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.  The principals reaffirmed the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award as final and binding on the parties to that proceeding and reconfirmed their resolve to work with partners to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.\n\n> The principals noted with concern China's recent unsafe and unprofessional encounters with naval vessels and aircraft that were exercising freedom of navigation and overflight, as established under international law.  They committed to maintain the steady and long-term presence of Australian and U.S. aircraft and vessels in the Indo-Pacific, consistent with international law and in partnership with other states, to promote stability and security in the region's vital international waterways, including the East and South China Seas.\n\n* shout outs to Japan and the Philippines for working with both countries on security issues\n* Australia gets added to Title III of the U.S. Defense Production Act so the US can throw money at it for stuff\n* All AUKUS countries get license-free defense trade, which will save UK and AUS billions as long as they buy within the trio\n* Military research/innovation/productization sharing\n\n> The United States and Australia committed to streamline cooperation on missile and uncrewed aerial vehicle technologies, particularly for Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise and AUKUS Pillar 2 Advanced Capabilities, and reiterated their respective commitments to upholding the standards of multilateral nonproliferation regimes. \n\n* then followed with three examples of what that means\n\n* GMLRS\n\n> The principals welcomed progress towards our 2023 commitment to collaborate on a flexible guided weapons production capability in Australia, with an initial focus on the co-production of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) by 2025.  They acknowledged Australia's intent to produce viable volumes of GMLRS for global consumption and welcomed efforts to finalize, by December 2024, the MOU to enable the co-assembly of GMLRS, with follow on mechanisms for co-production in the future.  The principals supported the establishment of a sovereign Australian solid rocket motor capability and manufacture of tactical training rounds.  \n\n * Australian M795 production and certification for US use\n\n> The principals welcomed progress on our 2023 commitment to share technical data on 155mm M795 munitions and highlighted Australia's investment in manufacturing 155mm M795 munitions in Australia.  They reaffirmed the support to fast tracked future productions. These efforts are intended to enable U.S. certification of Australian-manufactured munitions and Australia's deeper integration into the U.S. defense enterprise and global energetics supply chain.\n\n* PRSM\n\n> The principals acknowledged the supply chain complementarities between GMLRS and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM).  They committed to finalizing a PrSM MOU on cooperative Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development (PSFD) by December 2024 and announced the establishment of a Joint Program Office to advance cooperative activities on this critical munition in 2025.\n\n* Thumbs up for the Statement of Intent on Integrated Air and Missile Defense between the Australian Department of Defence and U.S. Department of Defense - interop between both countries' systems is the goal\n* Continued development of air-launched, air breathing hypersonic weapon (probably HACM at present, but Australian research predates that program)\n* Seeking increased opportunities for MRO&U collaboration, given their shared equipment\n* Unspecified other AUKUS Pillar 2 stuff like AI\n* then back to political statements (\"hamas bad\", \"houthis bad\", \"russia bad\", \"north korea bad\", \"states that proliferate nukes are bad\" etc)",

They noted grave concern about China&#39;s dangerous and escalatory behavior toward Philippine vessels lawfully operating within the Philippines&#39; exclusive economic zone.  The principals reaffirmed the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award as final and binding on the parties to that proceeding and reconfirmed their resolve to work with partners to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.</p>\n\n<p>The principals noted with concern China&#39;s recent unsafe and unprofessional encounters with naval vessels and aircraft that were exercising freedom of navigation and overflight, as established under international law.  They committed to maintain the steady and long-term presence of Australian and U.S. aircraft and vessels in the Indo-Pacific, consistent with international law and in partnership with other states, to promote stability and security in the region&#39;s vital international waterways, including the East and South China Seas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>shout outs to Japan and the Philippines for working with both countries on security issues</li>\n<li>Australia gets added to Title III of the U.S. Defense Production Act so the US can throw money at it for stuff</li>\n<li>All AUKUS countries get license-free defense trade, which will save UK and AUS billions as long as they buy within the trio</li>\n<li>Military research/innovation/productization sharing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The United States and Australia committed to streamline cooperation on missile and uncrewed aerial vehicle technologies, particularly for Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise and AUKUS Pillar 2 Advanced Capabilities, and reiterated their respective commitments to upholding the standards of multilateral nonproliferation regimes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>then followed with three examples of what that means</p></li>\n<li><p>GMLRS</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The principals welcomed progress towards our 2023 commitment to collaborate on a flexible guided weapons production capability in Australia, with an initial focus on the co-production of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) by 2025.  They acknowledged Australia&#39;s intent to produce viable volumes of GMLRS for global consumption and welcomed efforts to finalize, by December 2024, the MOU to enable the co-assembly of GMLRS, with follow on mechanisms for co-production in the future.  The principals supported the establishment of a sovereign Australian solid rocket motor capability and manufacture of tactical training rounds.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Australian M795 production and certification for US use</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The principals welcomed progress on our 2023 commitment to share technical data on 155mm M795 munitions and highlighted Australia&#39;s investment in manufacturing 155mm M795 munitions in Australia.  They reaffirmed the support to fast tracked future productions. These efforts are intended to enable U.S. certification of Australian-manufactured munitions and Australia&#39;s deeper integration into the U.S. defense enterprise and global energetics supply chain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PRSM</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The principals acknowledged the supply chain complementarities between GMLRS and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM).  They committed to finalizing a PrSM MOU on cooperative Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development (PSFD) by December 2024 and announced the establishment of a Joint Program Office to advance cooperative activities on this critical munition in 2025.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Thumbs up for the Statement of Intent on Integrated Air and Missile Defense between the Australian Department of Defence and U.S. Department of Defense - interop between both countries&#39; systems is the goal</li>\n<li>Continued development of air-launched, air breathing hypersonic weapon (probably HACM at present, but Australian research predates that program)</li>\n<li>Seeking increased opportunities for MRO&amp;U collaboration, given their shared equipment</li>\n<li>Unspecified other AUKUS Pillar 2 stuff like AI</li>\n<li>then back to political statements (&quot;hamas bad&quot;, &quot;houthis bad&quot;, &quot;russia bad&quot;, &quot;north korea bad&quot;, &quot;states that proliferate nukes are bad&quot; etc)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

That's what I can say: it's likely that the brigade involved in Ukraine's offensive operations in Kursk Oblast is in fact the 22nd Mechanized Brigade. During June they were likely withdrawn from Klishchiivka (the last time they were mentioned by the spokesman of the GoF \"South\", in the daily bulletin of the Russian MoD, was in mid-June) and [transferred](https://i.imgur.com/za40hwj.png) to Sumy Oblast (probably also for restoration of combat capabilities). Since yesterday morning the Russian MoD has identified the 22nd Mech Brigade as the responsible of these attacks - most of the time, it's reliable.\n\nHowever, the 22nd Mech Brigade had never been seen with Strykers. It's possible that in the last two months they have been assigned to it; after all, the UAF had quite a few Strykers in storage that were transferred last year. But it could also be possible that there is participation by elements of the 80th and/or 82nd Air Assault Brigades. Support units of these two brigades, as far as I have found and put in the image above, were recently reported to have been deployed in Sumy Oblast; maneuver units may have been deployed there too, although it's not certain at all. Besides, it's also too early for the first MIA notices to appear.\n\nIn Sumy Oblastm in addition to the 35th Regiment of the National Guard (which is covering the border in the Velyka Pysarivka area), there should also be battalions of the 103rd, 117th, 119th and 127th TDF Brigades, but these are probably covering the border (Sumy Oblast is pretty large) and haven't been committed in the attacks in my opinion.\n\nReinforcements are also on the way in critical sectors, by the way. In the Pokrovsk sector, (at least) elements of the 117th Mech Brigade are arriving from the Orikhiv sector according to the informations I have gathered, in addition to the 88th Mech Brigade (which would thus finally see its \"baptism of fire\", after a year and a half since its creation - this is the most \"mysterious\" brigade in the UAF). In the Toretsk sector, the 53rd Mech Brigade was transferred about a month ago from Sumy Oblast, where it had been regaining combat capability over the recent months. It likely relieved the most battered subunits of the 41st Mech Brigade and its \"endowments\" (primarily battalions of the 241st TDF Brigade) around Niu-York. Also from Sumy Oblast, where they were covering the border, elements of the new 150th Mech Brigade are arriving in the Toretsk sector. \n\nReturning to Kursk, on the Russian side in that area there were conscripts from regular units (a Russian regiment/brigade generally has a battalion of conscripts, which may be deployed to cover the state border with Ukraine, regardless of where the rest of the brigade is deployed in the \"SMO\" area); as well as detachments of the Border Service, along with smaller FSB quick reaction units. Reinforcements are probably now arriving, in terms of regular reserves of the GoF \"North\" (which are, however, concentrated in Belgorod Oblast: there are about 10k Russian servicemen in Kursk Oblast according to Ukrainian reports - roughly the same number as 6 months ago - compared to over 50k in Belgorod) and/or operational units of the Rosgvardia. Some Russian channels have been accusing for months, and even more since yesterday, the Kadyrovites (detachments of which cover the border in Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts) of avoiding active fighting and hiding behind conscripts, who are generally unprepared to deal with such situations. In addition, the GoF \"North\", which has jurisdiction over the affected area, has... several issues in terms of command and control compared to other GoFs. Moreover, at the end of July, a Russian Telegram channel mentioned the arrival of elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade in Kursk Oblast (e.g. its air assault battalion), to be deployed either near Sudzha (but at this point I don't know if this was actually the case), or to strengthen the operational reserve of the GoF \"North\".\n\nI personally don't believe in theories regarding the exchange of territories, negotiations, nuclear power plants, etc. In any case, I will write about this in more detail the next week, when there will be more news for sure. What's certain is that the Russians have been caught by surprise and will have to transfer reserves there (when a Russian channel, in late July, wrote about future plans to transfer several battalions of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade from the Kharkiv sector to the Pokrovsk sector); moreover, the topography of the place affected by the Ukrainian offensive operations is, well, very interesting... at least if compared to the dullness of Southern Ukraine but also of much of Donbas.",
