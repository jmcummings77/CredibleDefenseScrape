It's just costly in various ways. But was it too costly? They didn't lose public opinion in Russia, because they used scum, so little political cost. Obviously it's going to be tough to recruit more volunteers so it's potentially only a trick they can do once. They lost out on the equipment lost by casualties they couldn't recover. I'm not even sure they paid these people. So what else did it cost them?\n\nThe joys of being a piece of sht country that most of the world hates is they can do highly unethical crp like this and get away with it. \n\n>Again, the \"major damage\" to the ukrainian army is all assumed, as of now. \n\nIt's not assumed when people, to include Ukrainians themselves, have been talking about it since the fall. What's assumed are hard numbers, that won't matter anyway because war isn't a math problem.\n\nWhat is a problem is having enough offensively capable units who possess the skill and finesse to break through Russian defensive lines without needing to resort to Wagner-esque tactics. Which means the UAF needs to PRESERVE manpower and not try to exchange it in pointless meat grinder attritional battles that go south. \n\n>And it lies on the false assumptions that the russian army has somewhat unlimited manpower, that only convicts were used at bakhmut (while we know for sure that experienced wagner troops and VDV were used and lost there), **and that ukrainians have only lost skilled veterans, while we know for sure that many TDF units and other less valuable units were sent there.**\n\nFirst, I just want to reiterate to everyone reading this that you're trying to push the narrative that the Ukrainians themselves used the TDF as meat, all to protect the Ukrainian General Staff from an accusation that they lost good troops in large numbers. \n\nSecond, I never said only Wagner excons took casualties, I said most Russian casualties would be the \"meat\" whose tactics WANTED THEM TO TAKE CASUALTIES. They're used for reconnaissance in force, they're supposed to find mines by walking into mine fields, they're supposed to find defenses by being fired at by them. After that heavy weapons go to town on identified positions. Deliberate assaults by better units would only be planned when defenses were believed to be sufficiently weakened to fall to said assaults, hence the whole reason they tier the forces. One is totally expendable, the other is not.\n\nOn the flip side, the Ukrainians don't have expendable castes of troops.

It&#39;s just costly in various ways. But was it too costly? They didn&#39;t lose public opinion in Russia, because they used scum, so little political cost. Obviously it&#39;s going to be tough to recruit more volunteers so it&#39;s potentially only a trick they can do once. They lost out on the equipment lost by casualties they couldn&#39;t recover. I&#39;m not even sure they paid these people. So what else did it cost them?</p>\n\n<p>The joys of being a piece of sht country that most of the world hates is they can do highly unethical crp like this and get away with it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again, the &quot;major damage&quot; to the ukrainian army is all assumed, as of now. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not assumed when people, to include Ukrainians themselves, have been talking about it since the fall. What&#39;s assumed are hard numbers, that won&#39;t matter anyway because war isn&#39;t a math problem.</p>\n\n<p>What is a problem is having enough offensively capable units who possess the skill and finesse to break through Russian defensive lines without needing to resort to Wagner-esque tactics. Which means the UAF needs to PRESERVE manpower and not try to exchange it in pointless meat grinder attritional battles that go south. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it lies on the false assumptions that the russian army has somewhat unlimited manpower, that only convicts were used at bakhmut (while we know for sure that experienced wagner troops and VDV were used and lost there), <strong>and that ukrainians have only lost skilled veterans, while we know for sure that many TDF units and other less valuable units were sent there.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, I just want to reiterate to everyone reading this that you&#39;re trying to push the narrative that the Ukrainians themselves used the TDF as meat, all to protect the Ukrainian General Staff from an accusation that they lost good troops in large numbers. </p>\n\n<p>Second, I never said only Wagner excons took casualties, I said most Russian casualties would be the &quot;meat&quot; whose tactics WANTED THEM TO TAKE CASUALTIES. They&#39;re used for reconnaissance in force, they&#39;re supposed to find mines by walking into mine fields, they&#39;re supposed to find defenses by being fired at by them. After that heavy weapons go to town on identified positions. Deliberate assaults by better units would only be planned when defenses were believed to be sufficiently weakened to fall to said assaults, hence the whole reason they tier the forces. One is totally expendable, the other is not.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, the Ukrainians don&#39;t have expendable castes of troops. At least they shouldn&#39;t, and if they do then western support should probably be reevaluated because then Ukraine isn&#39;t much better than Russia. So assuming they don&#39;t use &quot;meat&quot; to hold the front lines and act at artillery targets to deliberately consume ammo by being hit with them, then they&#39;re all going to get pulverized by fires and assaulted on a more egalitarian manner.

With basic military armor PPE that'll mean fewer KIA than WIA. Their supply lines were only recently compromised, so good medevac procedures meant many WIA stayed WIA. \n\nBut I bet the overall casualty ratios would be far less than 5:1. \n\nNot that numbers matters, not after Russia finally decided to mobilize and when Wagner recruited \"meat\" to take Bakhmut in this manner.

The U.S. story is part of a larger remapping of world energy,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of the Ukraine a year ago has shifted global energy supply chains and put the U.S. clearly at the top of the world\u2019s energy-exporting nations.\n\nAs Europe struggled with threats to its supply of natural gas imports from Russia, U.S. exporters and others scrambled to divert cargoes of liquified natural gas from Asia to Europe. Russian oil has been sanctioned, and the European Union no longer accepts Moscow\u2019s seaborne cargoes. That has resulted in a surge in U.S. crude and refined product shipments to Europe.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. used to supply a military arsenal. Now it supplies an energy arsenal,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital.\n\nNot since the aftermath of World War II has the U.S. been so important as an energy exporter. The Energy Information Administration said a record 11.1 million barrels a day of crude and refined product were exported in the week ended Feb. 24. That is more than the total output of either Saudi Arabia or Russia, according to Citigroup, and compares with 9 million barrels a day a year ago.\n\nHowever, exports averaged about 10 million barrels a day over the four-week period ended Feb. 24. That compares with 7.6 million barrels a day in the year-ago period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think of all those decades of concern about energy dependence to find the U.S. is the largest exporter of LNG and one of the largest exporters of oil. The U.S. story is part of a larger remapping of world energy,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of S&P Global. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a continuing redrawing of world energy that began with the shale revolution in the United States. ... In 2003, the U.S. expected to be the largest importer of LNG.\u201d\n\nYergin said the changing role of the U.S. oil and gas industry in the world energy order will be a topic of conversation among the thousands attending the annual CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference in Houston from March 6-10. Among the speakers at the conference are CEOs from Chevron,\n Exxon Mobil,\n Baker Hughes\n and Freeport McMoRan\n, among others.\n\n\u201cOne of the ironies, from an energy perspective, is if you only looked straight back, where we were the day before the invasion ... if you look at price, you would say not much has happened,\u201d said Daniel Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners. \u201cThe price of global natural gas spiked but came back down. Oil is lower than where it was before the invasion. ... The reality is we certainly have set in motion a rejiggering of global supply chains, particularly on the natural gas side.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, the U.S. has been an annual net total energy exporter since 2018. Up to the early 1950s, the U.S. produced most of the energy it consumed, but in the mid-1950s the nation began to increasingly import greater amounts of crude and petroleum products.\n\nU.S. energy imports totaled about 30% of total U.S. consumption in 2005.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a global LNG boom that has become much more apparent and visible to the market,\u201d said Pickering. \u201cWe\u2019ve shifted around who consumes what kind of crude and products. We\u2019ve meaningfully changed where Russian oil moves to.\u201d\n\nIndia and China are now the biggest importers of Russia\u2019s crude. \u201cYou look at those things, and to me, we very clearly adjusted the way the world is thinking about supply for the next four or five years.\u201d\n\nBut a year ago, when Russia invaded Ukraine, it was not clear that the world would have sufficient supply or that oil prices would not spike to sharply higher levels. That is particularly true in Europe, where supplies have been sufficient.\n\nRBC commodities strategists said there were a number of factors at play that helped Europe get by this winter.\n\n\u201cA combination of warm weather, mandated conservation measures, and additional supplies from alternative producers such as the United States, Norway and Qatar, helped stave off such a worst-case scenario for Europe this winter,\u201d the strategists wrote. \u201cCountries that had relied on low cost Russian gas to meet their economic needs, such as Germany, raced to build new LNG import infrastructure to prepare for a future free from Moscow\u2019s molecules.\u201d\n\nBut they also point out that Europe is not in the clear, especially if the military conflict continues. \u201cKey gas producers have warned that it could be difficult for Europe to build storage this summer in the absence of Russian gas exports and a colder winter next year could cause considerable economic hardship,\u201d the strategists added.\n\nQatar has promised to send more gas to Europe, and the U.S. is building out more capacity. \u201cIn gas, we\u2019re going to be a very real player. We\u2019re trustworthy. We have rule of law. We have significant resources, and our projects are reasonably quick, compared to a lot of other potential projects around the world,\u201d said Pickering. \u201cMy guess is we will go from [capacity of] 12 [billion cubic feet] of exports a day to close to 20, and we will be a big supplier to Europe.\u201d\n\nPickering said U.S. exports are currently around 10 Bcf a day.\n\nThe oil story is different. Pickering said the U.S. industry chose not to be the global swing producer. \u201cWe\u2019re not the swing producer because we decided not to be with our capital discipline,\u201d he said.\n\nEnergy companies now have earnings visibility that they did not have before, and that could be the case for another five years or so, Pickering said. Oil companies have not been overproducing, as they had in the past, and they did not jump in to crank up production despite calls from the White House in the past year.\n\nThe White House has also been critical of the energy industry\u2019s share repurchase programs, which many have.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re generating a lot of cash. They\u2019re being rewarded by shareholders for being disciplined with that cash,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cYou did see companies signal their optimism, like with Chevron\u2019s $75 billion share repurchase.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe Russia, Ukraine dynamic may have ushered in an era where it\u2019s cool to bash big oil, but my expectation is you can bash all the way to the bank and the political dynamic is very different than the financial and economic dynamic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. now produces about 12.3 million barrels of oil a day, and Pickering does not expect that number to race higher. Producer discipline has helped support their share prices. The S&P energy sector is up 18% over the past 12 months, the best-performing sector and one of just three of 11 sectors that are showing gains. The next best was industrials, up 1.7%.\n\n\u201cOur absolute production levels are as high as they\u2019ve been when you combine oil and natural gas. We were a net importer, and we\u2019ve dramatically reduced that. It\u2019s a massive shift,\u201d said Pickering. \u201cThe shale boom benefited the energy sector. It benefited U.S. consumers. It was a terrible stretch for producers. They did their jobs too well. They overproduced. When we went from 5 million barrels a day to 13 million barrels a day, we were taking the most barrels away from OPEC. That was when we were most influential. We were the swing producer.\u201d",

A logistics battalion servicing one AA battalion and one infantry battalion, instead of the traditional three battalions of infantry. It's everything needed to operate independently in an A2AD role across an island chain. Except fire support, which does not necessarily need to be organic in a well-trained combined arms force with robust communications, F-35s, HIMARS, Tomahawks, and whatever else the Navy can float into range. AA on the other hand probably does need to be organic for a fully mobile independent unit, simply because enemy air assets can be deployed so much faster than any ground forces. AA also strengthens the unit's A2AD capabilities. \n\nOrganic artillery on the other hand would dramatically reduce the MLR's mobility, both because of the extra weight to lug around and the increased ammo supply requirements. Without it, the regiment can hop around much more freely than otherwise, making it difficult for the enemy to find them or predict where they will be. That in turn will make it hard for any enemy to bring ground forces to bear, and those forces will be subject to precision strikes even if they are able to engage the regiment. \n\nTanks are also not necessary because there isn't any need to attack through fortified lines in most cases. The US can simply bypass any fortified islands after destroying any A2AD systems from the sea or air. Unlike during WW2, the US doesn't need to use the islands as logistical stepping stones. It just needs to deny their use as observation posts or as bases for AD or surface-to-surface missiles. \n\nPlus tanks are heavy and mobility is the name of the game when it comes to the Pacific island chains. The physical environment is not conducive to concealment or cover, with most islands having flat terrain, little vegetation, and limited urban construction.

One might ask, if the Marine Corps sole claim of prowess is their expeditionary capability, then why not just fold that into the army, and just have a 1st, 2nd and 3rd Amphibious Assault Brigade or something like that? Force 2030 combines the traditional USMC force structure and operational profile and defines a mission set that keeps the Marines focused on a specialty that while the Army could do it, would be more efficient to keep as a dedicated force, much like how Space Force spun off from the Air Force for their mission.",

Both are complementary to their same service branch and are specialties within the same said branch. That goes too for the air assault and airborne units as well.  We don't have airborne infantry split off in their branch of the military own Paratrooper Corp that's its own branch of the military, their a specialized unit within the Army. Again to someone looking outside in, they might logically ask why does the water army have to be their own thing when the air army isn't?

Because to an outside observer it looks like for more than 30 years the Marine Corp has been spending a lot of time in the desert doing Army shit and acting like a smaller Army. The major amphibious operation of the Marines in the last 30 years was being a distraction along the Kuwaiti coast line to trick Saddam into moving more units out of position prior to Desert Storm. One of the biggest tank battles was the Marine tanks taking out the Iraqi forces at the Kuwait airport, but that wasn't in an amphibious operation, it was a conventional land attack not that dissimilar to the armored push by Army armored. In the GWOT, the Marines were patrolling cities and working in FOBs just like the Army. In the next global conflict, what exactly should the Marines be doing and is what they're doing different enough to justify having an entirely different branch of the military? You can talk about the Marine's doing things more cheaply, but is it really cheaper to keep an entire branch of the armed services dedicated to one job rather than just having one or two large specialized divisions in the Army?\n\nAgain, want to say I'm not actually advocating this, this is stuff and sentiments I've heard from friends and folks who have a passing interest in the military or are people on the outside looking in.

Because to an outside observer it looks like for more than 30 years the Marine Corp has been spending a lot of time in the desert doing Army shit and acting like a smaller Army. The major amphibious operation of the Marines in the last 30 years was being a distraction along the Kuwaiti coast line to trick Saddam into moving more units out of position prior to Desert Storm. One of the biggest tank battles was the Marine tanks taking out the Iraqi forces at the Kuwait airport, but that wasn&#39;t in an amphibious operation, it was a conventional land attack not that dissimilar to the armored push by Army armored. In the GWOT, the Marines were patrolling cities and working in FOBs just like the Army. In the next global conflict, what exactly should the Marines be doing and is what they&#39;re doing different enough to justify having an entirely different branch of the military? You can talk about the Marine&#39;s doing things more cheaply, but is it really cheaper to keep an entire branch of the armed services dedicated to one job rather than just having one or two large specialized divisions in the Army?</p>\n\n<p>Again, want to say I&#39;m not actually advocating this, this is stuff and sentiments I&#39;ve heard from friends and folks who have a passing interest in the military or are people on the outside looking in. I think it is a good discussion point to have to examine things.</p>\n</div>",

Every ABCT is still stuck in that cycle, this is the biggest complaint about being in ABCT\u2019s, the perpetual grind. Besides that, you only need 1/12 of your undeployed ABCT\u2019s to be ready. \n\n>One battalion in each regiment are always deployed, though not all as MEUs, who only came from 1st and 2nd MarDiv and joined Navy amphib fleets.

AIs who don't know the first thing about marksmanship whose only qualification is rank, which doesn't mean anything. People trying to train troops while on the firing line doing zeroing, which is too late. Solution to either failure to group/zero or failing the qualification range is to get back in line and draw more ammo, as if that's going to help if they couldn't figure it out the first time. On the actual qualification range, they're handing out loaded mags with bad mags that cause stoppages on a range type that doesn't allow for alibis. The targets are so shot to hell or just broken that 1/4-1/3 don't even register hits, but the range control assholes don't care and keep sending shooters to those lanes despite AIs routinely telling them \"yo, I've been on three relays and the 150m and 250m targets don't go down, and the 200m target won't even come up.\"\n\nAnd they wonder why they have a marksmanship problem...",

The Philippines is the last option and they&#39;re moving back into the US&#39; geopolitical orbit right now... </p>\n\n<p>North Korea and Russia would help, of course, but that&#39;s going to be by land routes.</p>\n\n<p>The US has a large fleet of nuclear attack submarines. If the US wished it there really isn&#39;t anything China can do to stop a naval blockade. Who knows how effectively it would be with the size of China&#39;s land borders.</p>\n</div>",

More recently, his government has faced mounting public criticism for its slow response after two catastrophic earthquakes struck the south of the country on Feb. 6, devastating cities and killing more than 50,000 people in Turkey and neighboring Syria.\n\n>In the wake of the tragedy, Erdogan has acknowledged delays in rescue efforts and asked for the public\u2019s forgiveness. Last week, in the ruined city of Adiyaman, he appealed to residents for their \u201cblessing.\u201d\n\n>\u201cUnfortunately, we could not carry out the activity we wanted in Adiyaman for the first few days due to the devastating effect of the tremors, adverse weather conditions and the difficulties brought by the damaged infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are aware of everything.\u201d\n\n>Erdogan\u2019s opponents have criticized his rapid accumulation of power and crackdown on political dissent over the years, and have vowed to restore democracy to Turkey. As the elections for parliament and president approach, the opposition must contend with Erdogan\u2019s significant and loyal base of supporters, and his chokehold on the media and state institutions, as well as its own glaring divisions over ideology and tactics, analysts said.\n\n>Erdogan has unleashed a wave of public spending in recent months to woo voters, including cheap loans, energy subsidies, tax relief and a lowering of the retirement age, allowing more than 2 million people to retire early and collect pensions.\n\n>The opposition alliance, called the Nation Alliance, was supposed to name its candidate last month but delayed the announcement, it said, because of the earthquake. On Friday, Meral Aksener, the chairwoman of the right-wing Good Party, the second-largest party in the bloc, withdrew from the alliance after disagreeing with the choice of Kilicdaroglu, as long-simmering tensions burst into public view.\n\n>The opposition would be better served, she said in a speech Friday, by selecting more popular figures from Kilicdaroglu\u2019s party: either Mansur Yavas, the mayor of Ankara, or Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, names she said her party had \u201cheard frequently in the streets, shops and squares for over three years.\u201d\n\n>The mayors came to office after an election in 2019 that saw a wave of opposition victories and dented Erdogan\u2019s aura of invincibility at the ballot box.\n\n>Opinion polls have shown both men would fare better than Kilicdaroglu in an election against Erdogan. \u201cWe understood that personal ambitions were preferred,\u201d Aksener said, referring to the CHP leader.\n\n>But on Monday, she rejoined the opposition bloc after meeting with the two mayors. The alliance released what it called a \u201croad map\u201d that laid out a transition of power that includes a return to a \u201cstrengthened\u201d parliamentary system, meant to reverse sweeping powers Erdogan assumed after a referendum in 2017.\n\n>The road map also called for the appointment of vice presidents, including Yavas and Imamoglu, a measure apparently aimed at bringing Aksener back into the fold.\n\n>\u201cWe will rule Turkey through consultation and consensus,\u201d Kilicdaroglu said during brief remarks in Ankara, the capital. \u201cWe will establish the power of morality and justice together.\u201d The Nation Alliance does not include a powerful Kurdish-led opposition party whose support is considered pivotal in Turkish elections.\n\n>Erdogan had portrayed the opposition bickering over the past few days as a sideshow while he focused on earthquake relief. On Monday, he announced that the death toll in Turkey had surpassed 46,000 people.\n\n>Hundreds of thousands of people in the country are still in temporary housing and the United Nations said Monday that its $1 billion appeal to assist survivors was only about 10 percent funded.\n\n>Without more funding, \u201cthe U.N. and its partners will not be able to meet the humanitarian needs,\u201d Alvaro Rodriguez, the U.N. resident coordinator in Turkey, warned in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nSo, after a bit of a shitshow, we have a firm matchup. Maybe some analysts have overhyped this election, but it's hard to shake a sense of just how important it is for a whole lot of reasons in the upcoming decade.",

It's like when you see people complain about \"government spending,\" not realizing that government spending in most countries is just spending back into that country's economy (the wages of government employees, for example, are \"government spending\" even though that is, in turn, paying people to be able to afford all the private sector goods and services they need).  \n\nSo, no matter what kinds of external sanctions affect Russia, the effect on its internal economy won't be immediately drastic. Only access to imported products and material. The only item of great note I've bought recently that was imported was a smartphone. Otherwise, everything else I've bought was either domestically produced, or could be replaced by a domestic good. If avocados suddenly become sanctioned, I don't have guacamole. I still end up eating something else. \n\nThe Russian economy has just shifted its purchases away from imported products, which makes life uncomfortable or inconvenient, but doesn't immediately result in a dramatic decline in GDP. Unless they were employed in a primarily export industry, or an import-reliant industry which has been eliminated, that just means they spend their money on other goods and services.\n\nI agree that 2022 was only the earliest phase of Russian economic contraction though. Their principle exports have been massively disrupted and while they can shift their export output to countries less worried by Western sanctions, those revenues will still likely decline as poorer countries have less ability to pay so will either have to import lower quantities or Russia will have to accept lower prices.",

This idea that the US wants to weaken Russia is one dreamt up by the fact that Russians think Americans have imperialistic goals with their foreign policy. That&#39;s because they who have lived under the Soviets, Russian empire, Tsardom, are literally incapable of imagining a world where people don&#39;t also have that mindset. They think the US wants to conquer everything, because they want to conquer everything. Making statements line &quot;ukraine never existed&quot; when it was the  Kievan RUS that formed fucking Russia.</p>\n</div>",

That's how defense in depth works, they need to be built in advance so this doesn't happen. \n\nI can understand if they backed off the effort during the fall, victory disease was pervasive among Ukrainians following the Kharkiv counteroffensive and they likely believed the threat against Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka was over.

So likely that's where they had to plan the next defensive line. \n\nThe issue with that is when the UAF units in and around Soledar would retreat that distance, ~ 5 km, it would expose the flanks of left and right UAF units, who'd also have to retreat. Which would be a major problem for Ukrainian brass, there would be a massive jump forward for the Russians and suddenly the northern flank of Bakhmut is threatened. \n\nBasing a defense on Krasna Hora wont work for long, it's low ground and open fields north and south so it'll be outflanked in relative short order. Once that happens, they need to retreat again, and then the M03 is threatened and the Russians have a gate into northern Bakhmut, which then bends the front lines there too and means more units now need to defend it from a N and NE axis.\n\nAdditionally, that retreat would also undermine the overall operational Siversk-Bakhmut line, greatly expanding the size of the front lines putting Siversk into a salient and requiring commitment of more reserves to hold a new east west defensive line needed to defend the south of Siversk from the T0513 highway axis. \n\nThe more the Russians bent the front lines, the longer it got. That means more units are needed to hold the defensive line around Bakhmut (that is no longer situated on very defensible ground) and Siversk too. And with heavier than expected casualties among defending units (like the 24th) it means having to tap in even more into their operational and strategic reserves, and it will only get worse from there.\n\nAll because Soledar. Such is the difficulty of a positional defense. Lose one key position and it can undermine everything. \n\nI'll bet the later uncovered history of the battle of Soledar will include quite a few significant UAF counterattacks that tried and failed to retake the flanks of Soledar so they could try to hold indefinitely.",

Her next door neighbor died and they had to pretty much draw straws to figure out who was going to remove the body when it started to smell. After her Uncle died from a tripwire IED the Russians set up, she and her brother had to evacuate at the last minute while trying to withstand the overwhelming smell of rotting flesh.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps not on quite the same scale as Stalingrad, but I still think stories like that qualify for what Dan Carlin might call the &quot;extremes of the human experience&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

I think this is the one thing the West *could* be relied to respond to, simply because not doing so would set precedent for how any nuclear power could take land it wanted.

To me, an intervention could be quite irrational in many cases and most policymakers would not see it in their best interests.
