It was the first major Ukrainian city to fall during Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion. In November, Ukrainian forces liberated the southeastern city, once home to more than 280,000 people.\n\n>\u201cWorking closely with Ukraine\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor General, a paper trail has been exposed that shows that the main torture chambers in Kherson and those administering them do so through the financial support of the Russian state,\u201d Wayne Jordash, an international human rights lawyer and managing partner of the law firm Global Rights Compliance, told CNBC.\n\n>Jordash added that the team of lawyers, experts and investigators uncovered that the torture sites were directly managed by several Kremlin security agencies, including Russia\u2019s Federal Security Services, known as the FSB.\n\n>\u201cMillions of rubles from Putin and his government helped to fund the Kherson torture chambers that were designed with one aim \u2013 to kill those who posed a threat to the Kremlin\u2019s plans to extinguish Ukrainian nationality and culture,\u201d added Jordash, who leads a Mobile Justice Team, a group of international lawyers and investigators supporting Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general\u2019s office.\n\n>The Mobile Justice Team is one component of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, which is funded by the State Department, European Union and the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\n\n>Prior to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the State Department had a small team in the country providing operational assistance to the prosecutor general.\n\n>\u201cAfter the invasion, we had to think about how to scale this and so we immediately reached out to the European Union and the United Kingdom and both were keen to join forces in this regard. And so this is now a three-way effort,\u201d said U.S. ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice Beth Van Schaack.\n\n>Van Schaack described the Mobile Justice Teams as a rapid response group made up of multinational and multidisciplinary experts tasked with helping investigators lock down crime scenes, identify evidence and interview survivors and witnesses. She added that Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general has catalogued more than 70,000 Russian war crimes since Moscow\u2019s conflict began a year ago.\n\n>\u201cThe goal is to support ultimately the prosecutor general in his efforts to do effective investigations to international standards, to put together dossiers on responsible individuals and ultimately to bring criminal cases in domestic courts,\u201d she added.\n\n>\u201cWhenever Russia has troops withdraw or troops retreat, journalists, human rights advocates, investigators, NGO workers are able to get into those areas and they are confronted by this potential evidence of serious atrocities,\u201d Van Schaack said, referencing a pattern seen in Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol, Izium, Kherson, Kharkiv and other liberated cities and towns.\n\n>A U.N. report previously outlined grisly accusations of war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\n>The Kremlin has previously denied that its forces commit war crimes or deliberately target civilians. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.\n\n>In Kherson, more than 1,000 Ukrainians gave first-hand accounts of their time in the torture centers, which were located in basements of abandoned buildings as well as in former prisons. More than 400 people were also reported to have vanished from Kherson torture sites, but it is not clear if they were killed or taken to Russian-held territory.\n\n>The torture sites served a variety of purposes, including, detention, interrogation, re-education and physical beatings.\n\n>Survivors also said in interviews with lawyers that electric shock torture and waterboarding were common tactics used by Russian forces at the torture centers.\n\n>In some cases, Ukrainians were forced into memorizing and reciting pro-Russian slogans, poems and songs.\n\n>\u201cThis is yet more evidence of genocidal tactics baked into Putin\u2019s plan to extinguish Ukrainian identity in the areas under Russian occupation,\u201d Jordash said.\n\n>He added that the Kremlin has shown no signs of relinquishing its ambitions to erase Ukrainian sovereignty in order to restore the Soviet empire.\n\n>\u201cMany more torture centers certainly exist around Ukraine in occupied areas and are being funded by Putin\u2019s credit card,\u201d Jordash added.",

In November, Ukrainian forces liberated the southeastern city, once home to more than 280,000 people.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWorking closely with Ukraine\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor General, a paper trail has been exposed that shows that the main torture chambers in Kherson and those administering them do so through the financial support of the Russian state,\u201d Wayne Jordash, an international human rights lawyer and managing partner of the law firm Global Rights Compliance, told CNBC.</p>\n\n<p>Jordash added that the team of lawyers, experts and investigators uncovered that the torture sites were directly managed by several Kremlin security agencies, including Russia\u2019s Federal Security Services, known as the FSB.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMillions of rubles from Putin and his government helped to fund the Kherson torture chambers that were designed with one aim \u2013 to kill those who posed a threat to the Kremlin\u2019s plans to extinguish Ukrainian nationality and culture,\u201d added Jordash, who leads a Mobile Justice Team, a group of international lawyers and investigators supporting Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general\u2019s office.</p>\n\n<p>The Mobile Justice Team is one component of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, which is funded by the State Department, European Union and the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the State Department had a small team in the country providing operational assistance to the prosecutor general.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAfter the invasion, we had to think about how to scale this and so we immediately reached out to the European Union and the United Kingdom and both were keen to join forces in this regard. And so this is now a three-way effort,\u201d said U.S. ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice Beth Van Schaack.</p>\n\n<p>Van Schaack described the Mobile Justice Teams as a rapid response group made up of multinational and multidisciplinary experts tasked with helping investigators lock down crime scenes, identify evidence and interview survivors and witnesses. She added that Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general has catalogued more than 70,000 Russian war crimes since Moscow\u2019s conflict began a year ago.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe goal is to support ultimately the prosecutor general in his efforts to do effective investigations to international standards, to put together dossiers on responsible individuals and ultimately to bring criminal cases in domestic courts,\u201d she added.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhenever Russia has troops withdraw or troops retreat, journalists, human rights advocates, investigators, NGO workers are able to get into those areas and they are confronted by this potential evidence of serious atrocities,\u201d Van Schaack said, referencing a pattern seen in Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol, Izium, Kherson, Kharkiv and other liberated cities and towns.</p>\n\n<p>A U.N. report previously outlined grisly accusations of war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The Kremlin has previously denied that its forces commit war crimes or deliberately target civilians. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>In Kherson, more than 1,000 Ukrainians gave first-hand accounts of their time in the torture centers, which were located in basements of abandoned buildings as well as in former prisons. More than 400 people were also reported to have vanished from Kherson torture sites, but it is not clear if they were killed or taken to Russian-held territory.</p>\n\n<p>The torture sites served a variety of purposes, including, detention, interrogation, re-education and physical beatings.</p>\n\n<p>Survivors also said in interviews with lawyers that electric shock torture and waterboarding were common tactics used by Russian forces at the torture centers.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, Ukrainians were forced into memorizing and reciting pro-Russian slogans, poems and songs.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is yet more evidence of genocidal tactics baked into Putin\u2019s plan to extinguish Ukrainian identity in the areas under Russian occupation,\u201d Jordash said.</p>\n\n<p>He added that the Kremlin has shown no signs of relinquishing its ambitions to erase Ukrainian sovereignty in order to restore the Soviet empire.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany more torture centers certainly exist around Ukraine in occupied areas and are being funded by Putin\u2019s credit card,\u201d Jordash added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

However, I think that sending Russian nationalists is a different proposition. First, they are not Ukrainian. Second, they are Russian, so they can demonstrate that Putin can be resisted by Russians - armed, nationalist Russians. It sends different messages to the different Russian publics (the nationalists, the anti-Putin side, and the pretend \"I'm outside of politics\" crowd). Putin is not in control, Russians can think, and do otherwise than they are otherwise told. it completely undermines the Kremlin's \"Putin strong and stable\", and \"stay out of politics\" propositions.\n\nThe question is if these messages will outweigh the Kremlin's efforts (already visible) to portray this as a terrorist threat to all Russians. I personally think so. If it persists, it will make Putin look weak, and ineffective, which I believe outweighs anything else.\n\nIt may not have been centrally planned, but I think it is a welcome initiative, and an opportunity to be seized, if it can be.",

Critics say not much has happened since.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/what-happened-to-the-german-militarys-100-billion-fund/a-64846571\">https://www.dw.com/en/what-happened-to-the-german-militarys-100-billion-fund/a-64846571</a></p>\n\n<p>Interesting overall article, a shocking excerpt: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The original estimate was that only \u20ac8 billion of the special fund would have to go toward the interest payments on the loan that the government had taken out. Now, thanks to rising interest rates, that estimate has gone up to \u20ac13 billion. So that leaves \u20ac87 billion of actual money to spend.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, there&#39;s inflation and the value-added tax, which mean that, once all the extra costs have been covered, only about \u20ac50 to \u20ac70 billion will be left over to spend on actual hardware. &quot;The longer you have this money sit around somewhere, the longer factors like inflation and interest payments have to eat away at this pile,&quot; says Rafael Loss, a defense specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why is military procurement subject to the value added tax? The government is taxing itself at a cost to national defense preparedness.</p>\n</div>",

Even if Ukraine forces Russia all the way back to the 1991 borders and then stops, the war isn't actually over, Russia can still keep attacking. So...that leaves \"both sides agree to stop fighting\", which is a negotiated settlement - the sides will make concessions of varying degrees, and agree a procedure for ceasing hostilities and demobilising.

Well, either that or Russia decides to force things back to option 1 and nukes Ukraine off the map, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWhat exactly the negotiated settlement will consist of depends on the situation when negotiations start. If Ukraine does manage to push Russia all the way out, it's unlikely that they'll agree to cede any territory. They might have to give up on the war crimes tribunals, though. If Ukraine doesn't manage to evict Russia in a year or three, the war might stall out and then we're looking at de facto territory concessions. It's really hard to say at the moment, both sides are taking absolutist positions, and neither side sees themselves as being in a losing situation that would require giving anything up.\n\nWhether Russia can be trusted to honour the agreement, whatever it is, in the long term, also depends.

If Russia actually manages to take the regions it formally annexed, they may settle for that...or they may see it as a starting point to take the rest. Hard to say. In the short term, though, there will be safeguards baked into the agreement to ensure it doesn't immediately get broken. There will be staged, matched demobilisations over a long time. Demilitarised zones. Third-party observers. Ukraine's probably joining NATO as soon as the shooting stops, if it's not explicitly ruled out by the peace agreement.

But that doesn't mean there can't be a settlement that stops the fighting. The settlement will just have to be evaluated based on what it does, not based on what countries promise to do.

Both sides agree that Donbass, Crimea, and Luhansk will have new referenda to decide where they end up permanently. Negotiation of a full peace treaty deciding the terms of the referenda to follow.\n\nSettlement B: ceasefire, Russia reaffirms Ukrainian sovereignty, both sides stay where they are, Russia promises to negotiate with Ukraine on the terms of local referenda in each of the contested territories to determine who gets what.  Full peace treaty to follow the referenda.\n\nBoth end the fighting and involve a combination of promises and action.  If you look at the talk, they look similar: ceasefire, referenda, sovereignty.  Of course, when you look at their actual effect on who has control of what, they're very different. A is a clear victory for Ukraine: Russia has immediate obligations to act and the war can be expected to restart quickly if those short term promises are not honored. It's a Russian surrender in all but name. B, on the other hand, is a clear Russian victory: Ukraine has basically given Russia everything that it currently controls but reserved the right to be mad about it when Russia reneges on its promises.",

                        "body": "> And confidentiality; sharing those documents with ChatGPT would require some sort of assurance that the documents did not become public\n\nThat's a very solvable problem. Although convincing the bar that's true may be challenging given the profession's historically strong streak of tech illiteracy. Unlike some other ML systems like Reinforcement Learning models, ChatGPT doesn't incorporate user feedback directly into its model so any information it interacts with for an attorney would not be retained by the ML model server itself. I believe they are using some user feedback to guide manual tuning, which is why there is a little feedback box that pops up after a message from the bot, but that's a feature of the web application and isn't built into the LLM itself, again unlike an RL system. The LLM does retain a limited conversational history for context, but it is ephemeral and not retained outside of wherever the conversation itself is stored. \n\nIt's perfectly straightforward to deploy an LLM and the web app to store that conversational history to a fully isolated environment (either on-prem or in the cloud) where it cannot even theoretically communicate with the external world, so there would be no risk of disclosure. In the defense world, that would mean deploying to a GovCloud instance that is at least Impact Level 4 certified, depending on the classification level of the documents you want to let it loose on. IL4 is for Controlled Unclassified Information, IL5 is for Secret, IL6 for Top Secret. Each of those options runs on a physically isolated network (and the S/TS networks do not even physically interface with the civilian internet at all) from which it is *extraordinarily* difficult to transfer data, even for legitimate purposes, because the data have to go through a slow and demanding declassification process (well, not for CUI, obviously, but the system's logical and physical architecture are somewhat similarly designed to prevent data spillage). \n\n\n> The only way I can see firms agreeing to use ChatGPT for doc review is for ChatGPT to offer a full indemnity in the event of a malpractice suit.\n\nI'm not so sure of that. If OpenAI or whoever is monetizing LLMs this way can demonstrate that their system results in an error rate comparable to that of humans, I think it would be perfectly reasonable for attorneys to rely on it (and thus would not breach any duty of care). A tired attorney locked in some doc review mill basement can make mistakes too, and not every error amounts to malpractice, nor does an adverse legal outcome necessarily show malpractice. Many lawsuits these days (maybe most large ones? idk I've been out of the legal tech world for a while at this point so you probably know better) have substantially more discovery materials than can reasonably be reviewed by the parties' attorneys, so they rely on keyword searches and other shortcuts to try to more efficiently process the documentation. \n\nThe common standard for negligent malpractice has four elements: a duty of care, breach, causation, and damages. Causation and damages are fact intensive so not relevant for determining whether it is *a priori* negligent to use ChatGPT. The duty of care for attorneys is a pretty low bar to meet. They are only required to possess and exercise the reasonable skills or knowledge of an attorney, and there is wide latitude for applying professional judgment to ambiguous fact patterns. So treating ChatGPT like a super fancy keyword search seems perfectly acceptable to me, if it reduces the amount of manual review required or enables review of an otherwise unmanageably large corpus. This approach particularly benefits less well-off clients who can't afford an extensive discovery process and would be prevented from pursuing a suit without the ability to review a massive document dump. \n\nSo it comes down to the types of errors we might expect and whether they have the potential to cause damages to a client in a manner that a reasonable attorney could not prevent. ChatGPT (or any doc review search tool really) has two primary failure modes: false positives where it actively misrepresents a document's contents as relevant when it is **not** relevant, and false negatives where it fails to detect relevant information. False negatives happen all the time when the documentation is too voluminous to review and the attorneys just don't happen to get eyes on some potentially critical piece of information. Using ChatGPT is no worse than that.\n\nFor a false positive, though, no competent attorney would include a reference to a document in their brief without verifying that the document says what they are representing it to say. That means even if ChatGPT returns a false positive, a human being will review the document and have the opportunity to override its conclusions. Unless the document is blindly included as part of a collection of documents that demonstrate the same fact or facts repeatedly, in which case reviewing a representative sample seems like it would be sufficient in many cases. Which means ChatGPT isn't worse than the status quo ante and using it thus meets the attorney's duty of care. Bottom line: while it may not give definitive, final answers to the relevant legal issues, it could dramatically reduce the amount of material the lawyers need to manually review.\n\nOne great example comes to mind from a case I worked on many years ago on an R&D tax credit controversy. Typically, companies hire accountants or consultants to collect contemporaneous technical documentation to justify taking the credit before claiming it on their returns, but sometimes the clients are not so bright (or their consultants weren't) and their lawyers need to rework the documentation once the credit is already in controversy for some reason. That involves having lawyers and/or accountants reading tons of poorly written, often ad hoc internal technical documentation like emails and Jira tickets, typically in a massive file dump from some apathetic if not actively hostile IT guy with zero investment in the activities of the accounting department. Reviewing the docs is extremely easy work and something that a first or second year accountant at a public accounting firm might handle. \n\nThe credit involves a four part test to determine whether a given project qualifies. A business component (which more or less means a project) has to be developed for (1) a permitted purpose (2) to eliminate uncertainty that is (3) technical in nature (4) using a systematic process of experimentation. But practically the IRS only ever argues about uncertainty and process of experimentation. So in doc review, you basically just need to look for signs of technical uncertainty and a process of experimentation, then link any document doing so to the specific project that is being qualified for the credit. ChatGPT 100% could handle a prompt like \"Find documents in this corpus relating to Project X that describe technical topics.\" And perhaps with a little coaching, I think it could identify signs of uncertainty or a process of experimentation, but that's obviously a harder question even for a human. Either way, you've dramatically reduced the manual labor involved.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>And confidentiality; sharing those documents with ChatGPT would require some sort of assurance that the documents did not become public</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a very solvable problem. Although convincing the bar that&#39;s true may be challenging given the profession&#39;s historically strong streak of tech illiteracy. Unlike some other ML systems like Reinforcement Learning models, ChatGPT doesn&#39;t incorporate user feedback directly into its model so any information it interacts with for an attorney would not be retained by the ML model server itself. I believe they are using some user feedback to guide manual tuning, which is why there is a little feedback box that pops up after a message from the bot, but that&#39;s a feature of the web application and isn&#39;t built into the LLM itself, again unlike an RL system. The LLM does retain a limited conversational history for context, but it is ephemeral and not retained outside of wherever the conversation itself is stored. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s perfectly straightforward to deploy an LLM and the web app to store that conversational history to a fully isolated environment (either on-prem or in the cloud) where it cannot even theoretically communicate with the external world, so there would be no risk of disclosure. In the defense world, that would mean deploying to a GovCloud instance that is at least Impact Level 4 certified, depending on the classification level of the documents you want to let it loose on. IL4 is for Controlled Unclassified Information, IL5 is for Secret, IL6 for Top Secret. Each of those options runs on a physically isolated network (and the S/TS networks do not even physically interface with the civilian internet at all) from which it is <em>extraordinarily</em> difficult to transfer data, even for legitimate purposes, because the data have to go through a slow and demanding declassification process (well, not for CUI, obviously, but the system&#39;s logical and physical architecture are somewhat similarly designed to prevent data spillage). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only way I can see firms agreeing to use ChatGPT for doc review is for ChatGPT to offer a full indemnity in the event of a malpractice suit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not so sure of that. If OpenAI or whoever is monetizing LLMs this way can demonstrate that their system results in an error rate comparable to that of humans, I think it would be perfectly reasonable for attorneys to rely on it (and thus would not breach any duty of care). A tired attorney locked in some doc review mill basement can make mistakes too, and not every error amounts to malpractice, nor does an adverse legal outcome necessarily show malpractice. Many lawsuits these days (maybe most large ones? idk I&#39;ve been out of the legal tech world for a while at this point so you probably know better) have substantially more discovery materials than can reasonably be reviewed by the parties&#39; attorneys, so they rely on keyword searches and other shortcuts to try to more efficiently process the documentation. </p>\n\n<p>The common standard for negligent malpractice has four elements: a duty of care, breach, causation, and damages. Causation and damages are fact intensive so not relevant for determining whether it is <em>a priori</em> negligent to use ChatGPT. The duty of care for attorneys is a pretty low bar to meet. They are only required to possess and exercise the reasonable skills or knowledge of an attorney, and there is wide latitude for applying professional judgment to ambiguous fact patterns. So treating ChatGPT like a super fancy keyword search seems perfectly acceptable to me, if it reduces the amount of manual review required or enables review of an otherwise unmanageably large corpus. This approach particularly benefits less well-off clients who can&#39;t afford an extensive discovery process and would be prevented from pursuing a suit without the ability to review a massive document dump. </p>\n\n<p>So it comes down to the types of errors we might expect and whether they have the potential to cause damages to a client in a manner that a reasonable attorney could not prevent. ChatGPT (or any doc review search tool really) has two primary failure modes: false positives where it actively misrepresents a document&#39;s contents as relevant when it is <strong>not</strong> relevant, and false negatives where it fails to detect relevant information. False negatives happen all the time when the documentation is too voluminous to review and the attorneys just don&#39;t happen to get eyes on some potentially critical piece of information. Using ChatGPT is no worse than that.</p>\n\n<p>For a false positive, though, no competent attorney would include a reference to a document in their brief without verifying that the document says what they are representing it to say.

Sure, because rates can be higher or lower, but I'm aware of no grand battles except maybe western front world war 1 where the collapse happened because of pure attrition, the attrition matters because it saps the strength of forces, which is predictive of when a rout occurs. Even in world war 1, neither the German or the Allied front collapsed. It just became predictive because of the high losses that Germany had, combined with a broken morale and economy, that the Allies were on the verge of the final break through, and the Germans pushed for peace rather than suffer the collapse of their entire line. \n\n\nSo what about this article? He assumes it's a meat grinder. By doing so, he's begging the question. It's a meat grinder because Russia is not winning a rout or decisive victory, leading to something a bit more fluid than a stalemate. But by assuming that Ukrainian attacks are going to be meat grinders through and through, he basically assumes Ukrainian defeat. No shit, if you assume Ukraine cannot win, then Ukraine cannot win. \n\nBut if Mariupol fell to the Ukrainians, I very much believe it's not going to be a 4 year push in Bakhmut style attacks until they reach the city, rather, it will be a push that will be a rout, or they won't even come close to the city. Will Ukraine achieve this? That's where it becomes much more of a probability. \n\nFor breakthroughs to occur, you need a stars to align kind of moment. To use AOE2 as a quick example, in that game, if you and your opponent have equal resources and military, who can win? It really does come down to a moment where someone gets lucky, and has an artillery unit smash your opponents troops, or spearmen take down expensive knights, etc. It's a true stars align kind of moment, but as soon as it happens once, the game is over. \n\nWith Ukraine, their odds of having those moments increase over time as long as western aid lasts, and Russia's odds decreases as their old stockpiles deplete. One more Kharkiv style breakthrough, a \"fluke\" that would've always failed if the Russians knew it was coming weeks in advance, and you very well may see Mariupol come under threat by Ukraine again. \n\nBut there's no guarantee of that occurring. Just like how in that game you'd never move your units to get hit by your opponent's artillery with perfect knowledge, Russian lines shouldn't break to Ukrainian attacks, if Russians acted perfectly. \n\nBut the whole game theory is that there will be a slip up, and that's what the author misses. \n\nRome wouldn't have marched into Parthia if they knew Carrhae, Rome wouldn't have been destroyed by Hannibal if they had predicted his tactics at Cannae. France would've likely not fallen in world war 2 if they knew the German plan. Soviet Union probably could've pushed the Germans back much sooner if they had perfect leadership. But the opposites happened precisely because of imperfections. And those imperfections are the essence of decisive victories.\n\n\nTLDR: the author of this article assumes Ukraine will lose and then uses that to claim that Ukraine will lose while ignoring that wars and battles usually turn around because of unlikely breakthroughs, rather than through mathematical attrition alone.",

There is clear asymmetry between the capabilities and tactics of the two belligerents. So why would we expect symmetry in how their offensives play out? Ukraine has demonstrated that it is significantly more averse to casualties during offensives than the Russians are. That cultural difference alone makes the argument that their offensives will be a meat grinder patently false, since they would simply not conduct such an offensive. \n\nBut more importantly and concretely, the UAF enjoys an enormous set of advantages in terms of precision guided munitions and the ISR complex that provides targeting and BDA for those PGMs. Whereas the Russians enjoy advantages in raw personnel numbers and traditional artillery. The UAF advantages do not lend themselves toward a meat grinder campaign, whereas the Russian advantages do. The Ukrainians can best exploit their asymmetric advantages with interdiction campaigns against supply hubs to starve the Russians of ammo and thus force them from their entrenched positions without needing to conduct potentially high casualty frontal assaults.

There is clear asymmetry between the capabilities and tactics of the two belligerents. So why would we expect symmetry in how their offensives play out? Ukraine has demonstrated that it is significantly more averse to casualties during offensives than the Russians are. That cultural difference alone makes the argument that their offensives will be a meat grinder patently false, since they would simply not conduct such an offensive. </p>\n\n<p>But more importantly and concretely, the UAF enjoys an enormous set of advantages in terms of precision guided munitions and the ISR complex that provides targeting and BDA for those PGMs. Whereas the Russians enjoy advantages in raw personnel numbers and traditional artillery. The UAF advantages do not lend themselves toward a meat grinder campaign, whereas the Russian advantages do. The Ukrainians can best exploit their asymmetric advantages with interdiction campaigns against supply hubs to starve the Russians of ammo and thus force them from their entrenched positions without needing to conduct potentially high casualty frontal assaults. So unless the Ukrainians suddenly become much stupider, there&#39;s no reason to expect them to engage in such a campaign.</p>\n</div>",

It would take less than two years for the S-400s to be operational.\n\n>>\u201cThe longer you wait, the harder that becomes,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of a strike on Iran at a security conference in Tel Aviv last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited very long. I can tell you that I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\n>Such open threats \u2014 daily occurrences now in Israel \u2014 are a complex mix of intent and messaging aimed at Tehran and Washington although Israel bombed nuclear sites in Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007. An open military conflict with Iran could trigger an unparalleled regional conflagration affecting global oil supplies.\n\n>Russia has offered Iran \u201cunprecedented defense cooperation, including on missiles, electronics and air defense\u201d and may provide Tehran with fighter jets, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last Friday. \n\n>The Kremlin and the Russian Defense Ministry didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, Netanyahu\u2019s office declined to comment. \n\n>Concern has grown over Iran\u2019s nuclear work since international monitors detected uranium enriched to 84% purity \u2014 just below the 90% needed for weapons. By the end of 2023, Iran will have enough uranium enriched to 60% to produce 10 bombs, according to a senior Israeli official and a former senior US official. \n\n>Israel continues to hope the US will take the lead on any possible strike and while the Biden administration hasn\u2019t ruled out military action, it prefers diplomacy. \n\n>Iran accuses Israel of assassinating its nuclear scientists, most recently as in late 2020, as well as hacking and other nuclear sabotage. Israel doesn\u2019t publicly own up to them but they are widely acknowledged by officials both in the US and in Israel.\n\n>Iran says its decades-long atomic program is for peaceful purposes, but Western powers say it\u2019s building the capabilities to make a nuclear bomb.\n\n>>Drones and Fighter Jets\n\n>In December, the US said Russia was deepening military backing for Iran in return for Iranian supplies of drones for Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. The next month, an Iranian lawmaker said Tehran expects a delivery of Su-35 fighter jets from Russia by mid-March. \n\n>Russia has very good ties with Iran and Tehran is looking for more support, said Elena Suponina, a Moscow-based Middle East expert. \n\n>After the US and five other powers signed a deal with Iran in 2015 restricting its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, Russia sold it a less advanced air defense system, the S-300s. The nuclear deal fell apart in 2018 when President Donald Trump withdrew the US.\n\n> The S-400s, which can hit aerial targets at a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), would create a \u201cred zone for high-altitude aircraft,\u201d said Jeremy Binnie, Middle East defense expert at Janes, the UK-based defense intelligence firm.\n\n>\u201cThe more air defenses they have, the more difficult it is to hit them,\u201d said Yossi Kuperwasser, a former top Israeli military intelligence official and now a senior researcher at the Israel Defense and Security Forum, an association of former and reserve members of the security forces. \u201cWe are analyzing when is the most convenient time to take action.\u201d\n\n>Israel has been here before. In 2015, Israeli TV played recorded conversations with Ehud Barak, who was Netanyahu\u2019s defense minister in 2012, speaking explicitly of plans to attack Iran that were shelved after discussions with the US. \n\n>Israeli officials are watching not only Iran\u2019s ability to withstand an air attack but its capacity to build a nuclear bomb.\n\n>They calculate that once Iran decides to weaponize, \u201cit\u2019s anything between 18 to 24 months for them to build the first warhead,\u201d Mark Dubowitz, head of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which lobbies for measures to counter Iran, said in an interview in Tel Aviv. \n\n>After Joe Biden defeated Trump, his administration tried to revive the Iran nuclear deal but blamed Tehran for walking away. US Ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, recently indicated understanding for Israel\u2019s approach. \n\n>\u201cIsrael can and should do whatever they need to deal with (Iran) and we\u2019ve got their back,\u201d he said at an event on Feb. 19.\n\n>The US and Israel recently held highly publicized military exercises in the Mediterranean, the largest ever drills between the two allies in a demonstration of aerial force.\n\n>New US-built air refueling aircraft which the Israelis are due to receive by 2025 would significantly increase their long-range capability, said Binnie at Janes.  \n\n>Gulf nations would be at some risk but many are hoping Israel will act \u2014 even if it only sets back Iranian nuclear ambitions for a few years, said Riad Kahwagi, founder and chief executive officer of INEGMA, a Dubai-based security research group.",

At some public universities scientists get a 700,000 yuan bonus for each paper published by top academic journals, according to the same study published in the magazine Chinese Science and Technology Talent in March.\n\n> The background to this increase in top scientists\u2019 salaries is China\u2019s enormous spending on research and development. A total 1.4 trillion yuan was spent on the sector last year, according to the government, more than the entire GDP of New Zealand. Most R&D funds were previously spent on purchasing hardware with salaries for staff considered less important. Now government leaders have decreed that attracting the best talent is more important.\n\n> [...]\n\n> But many millionaires working in science have been created by the government and local authorities new found largesse, according to observers. The \u201cThousand Talents\u201d scheme launched by the central government in 2011, for instance, offered a one-off 1 million yuan bonus, with at least 3 million yuan in research funds, to successful applicants.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Scientists are paid peanuts in the US, that&#39;s why.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, China is turning its scientists into millionaires, thanks largely to taxpayer money: <a href=\"https://www.studyinchina.com.my/web/page/rise-of-chinas-millionaire-research-scientists/\">https://www.studyinchina.com.my/web/page/rise-of-chinas-millionaire-research-scientists/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe gap is vanishing,\u201d said a senior life scientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of the nation\u2019s top research centres. \u201cIn major cities, more and more Chinese scientists are making as much as they can for the same position in the US,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The average annual starting salary for a professor returning from overseas to a major university in China is about 800,000 yuan (HK$955,000) a year, or more than US$120,000, according to a study by researchers at the Science and Technology Talent Centre under the Ministry of Science and Technology. At some public universities scientists get a 700,000 yuan bonus for each paper published by top academic journals, according to the same study published in the magazine Chinese Science and Technology Talent in March.</p>\n\n<p>The background to this increase in top scientists\u2019 salaries is China\u2019s enormous spending on research and development. A total 1.4 trillion yuan was spent on the sector last year, according to the government, more than the entire GDP of New Zealand. Most R&amp;D funds were previously spent on purchasing hardware with salaries for staff considered less important. Now government leaders have decreed that attracting the best talent is more important.</p>\n\n<p>[...]</p>\n\n<p>But many millionaires working in science have been created by the government and local authorities new found largesse, according to observers. The \u201cThousand Talents\u201d scheme launched by the central government in 2011, for instance, offered a one-off 1 million yuan bonus, with at least 3 million yuan in research funds, to successful applicants.

Beyond the local economic benefits, the Philippines\u2019 strategic location means that a renewed US presence would be a huge asset to Washington in case of a conflict over Taiwan.\n\n>In contrast to earlier decades, when the US-Philippine alliance was seen as skewed toward Washington, now Manila has security concerns of its own.\n\n>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s government is looking to counter a record number of Chinese incursions in the disputed South China Sea that have seen Filipino fishing ships harassed or driven away from traditional waters. Public outcry erupted last month when a Chinese coast guard vessel aimed a laser at a Philippine ship. \n\n>Marcos was blunt in telling the armed forces this week that their mission has changed, and put US-China tensions as the reason why. \n\n>\u201cThere was a time where we did not have to worry about these threats and the intensification of the competition between the superpowers,\u201d Marcos said Feb. 27. \u201cNow things have begun to change and we must adjust accordingly.\u201d \n\n>So far, public sentiment appears to be on the side of stronger US ties.\n\n>In a survey published Feb. 9 by the ASEAN Studies Centre at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, nearly 79% of Filipinos said if Southeast Asia were forced to choose between the US and China, they would choose the former.  \n\n>Marcos isn\u2019t just looking for US support: he\u2019s turning to regional allies as well. He said he\u2019d be open to a reciprocal military access agreement with Japan if it would protect the country\u2019s fishermen and its maritime territory, and last month the Philippines said it\u2019s considering joint patrols with Australia.\n\n>>\u201cThe Philippines straddles a crucial location in the Pacific, and we have seaboards to the north, south, east and west,\u201d Defense Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAll of these must be monitored and protected.\u201d\n\n>But while US-China tensions are driving the rapprochement, America\u2019s complicated past with the Philippines, and fears that embracing Washington will drag Manila into any future conflict with China, are giving some communities pause.\n\n>\u201cThey are not welcome,\u201d said Manuel Mamba, governor of Cagayan province, which hosts one of the facilities US troops might soon have access to. \u201cChina has been good to us. I don\u2019t see any threat coming from them and my province is one of the nearest to them.\u201d\n\n>That kind of pushback may be why US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Galvez stopped short of disclosing where US troops would be working when they agreed last month to expand the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. That\u2019s a 2014 accord that was shelved under former President Rodrigo Duterte. \n\n>The EDCA deal allows the US to rotate troops for prolonged stays as well as build and operate facilities at designated sites, most of which are expected to be in the country\u2019s north, closer to Taiwan, or along the South China Sea. \n\n>Austin hailed the agreement as a \u201creally big deal,\u201d and it was seen as more evidence that Washington\u2019s long-promised pivot to Asia is finally underway. \n\n>But in a joint briefing with Austin, Galvez was careful to refer to the four unnamed locations US forces would go to under the agreement as \u201cEDCA sites,\u201d not bases, and stressed that the deal was still contingent on consultations with local authorities. President Marcos later said Subic Bay isn\u2019t on the list of sites being considered, after a Philippine defense official said it was last year.\n\n>The EDCA expansion \u201cis heavy on the hype, but wanting on the substance,\u201d said Rommel Ong, a retired rear admiral in the Philippine Navy who is now a professor at Ateneo de Manila University\u2019s School of Government. \n\n>Governor Mamba says he believes hosting American troops would be a security risk for his province, located about 300 kilometers (200 miles) from Taiwan at the northern tip of Luzon island. He also fears it would torpedo a $7 billion Chinese infrastructure package he said could transform the otherwise sleepy province.\n\n>In other communities, stories about mistreatment by visiting US troops in the past still resonate. The killing of a transgender Filipino in Subic Bay in 2014 by a US Marine on leave from a visiting warship sparked outrage and a renewed clamor for a review of the Philippines\u2019 military commitments.\n\n>\u201cLocal opposition probably is a concern, certainly,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former operations director at U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. \u201cThe US Navy was not very popular there.\u201d\n\n>And then there\u2019s the fear of getting pulled too deep into a US-China conflict. That was behind the objections raised by President Marcos\u2019s sister, Senator Imee Marcos. The senator, who chairs the foreign relations committee and is known for her political independence, grilled Defense Secretary Galvez at a hearing on Wednesday. \n\n>\u201cWe are not volunteering to fight wars that are not our own,\u201d the senator said. The president\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks. \n\n>Within Southeast Asia, not all leaders are comfortable with the US embrace. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says welcoming military forces is the wrong approach to deescalating tensions. \n\n>\u201cIt would be disconcerting if any force, East or West, starts showing military might or presence within Asean,\u201d Anwar said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel in the Philippines broadcast on Friday.\n\n>It\u2019s all evidence of how President Marcos has to navigate the US-China relationship carefully. Like other regional leaders, he has an interest in maintaining ties with Beijing, his country\u2019s top trading partner. In January, Marcos visited President Xi Jinping, with the two sides agreeing to resume talks on joint oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. \n\n>In the end, however, Marcos appears more open to the US than many experts expected. The president\u2019s remarks ruling out Subic Bay from the list of places expected to welcome more US troops may be more symbolic than substantive. US Navy ships still call there and American troops flow in for the annual Balikatan military exercises. \n\n>Paulino \u2014 the Subic Bay authority\u2019s director \u2014 said it\u2019s time to move on. The area he oversees could benefit from more investment.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-02/marcos-embrace-of-us-troops-near-taiwan-revives-old-grievances\">US Troop Expansion Near Taiwan Revives Old Debate in Philippines</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>American troops \u2018are not welcome,\u2019 one key governor says</li>\n<li>Military ties with US progressing rapidly amid China tensions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been more than three decades since the Philippines ordered US troops to withdraw from their sprawling military bases in the country, ending an era that hearkened back to America\u2019s colonial days. </p>\n\n<p>Now the man overseeing the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority \u2014 once home to the US\u2019s biggest naval base in Asia \u2014 wants them back. </p>\n\n<p>A recently revived defense agreement between the US and the Philippines could \u201cbe a welcome development for us\u201d if American forces return to Subic Bay, said Rolen Paulino, the authority\u2019s chairman, in an interview. \u201cWhen they come here they spend money, go to hotels, go to restaurants \u2014 plus tourists.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Paulino isn\u2019t alone. Beyond the local economic benefits, the Philippines\u2019 strategic location means that a renewed US presence would be a huge asset to Washington in case of a conflict over Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to earlier decades, when the US-Philippine alliance was seen as skewed toward Washington, now Manila has security concerns of its own.</p>\n\n<p>President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s government is looking to counter a record number of Chinese incursions in the disputed South China Sea that have seen Filipino fishing ships harassed or driven away from traditional waters. Public outcry erupted last month when a Chinese coast guard vessel aimed a laser at a Philippine ship. </p>\n\n<p>Marcos was blunt in telling the armed forces this week that their mission has changed, and put US-China tensions as the reason why. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere was a time where we did not have to worry about these threats and the intensification of the competition between the superpowers,\u201d Marcos said Feb. 27. \u201cNow things have begun to change and we must adjust accordingly.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>So far, public sentiment appears to be on the side of stronger US ties.</p>\n\n<p>In a survey published Feb. 9 by the ASEAN Studies Centre at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, nearly 79% of Filipinos said if Southeast Asia were forced to choose between the US and China, they would choose the former.  </p>\n\n<p>Marcos isn\u2019t just looking for US support: he\u2019s turning to regional allies as well. He said he\u2019d be open to a reciprocal military access agreement with Japan if it would protect the country\u2019s fishermen and its maritime territory, and last month the Philippines said it\u2019s considering joint patrols with Australia.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe Philippines straddles a crucial location in the Pacific, and we have seaboards to the north, south, east and west,\u201d Defense Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAll of these must be monitored and protected.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But while US-China tensions are driving the rapprochement, America\u2019s complicated past with the Philippines, and fears that embracing Washington will drag Manila into any future conflict with China, are giving some communities pause.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey are not welcome,\u201d said Manuel Mamba, governor of Cagayan province, which hosts one of the facilities US troops might soon have access to. \u201cChina has been good to us. I don\u2019t see any threat coming from them and my province is one of the nearest to them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That kind of pushback may be why US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Galvez stopped short of disclosing where US troops would be working when they agreed last month to expand the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. That\u2019s a 2014 accord that was shelved under former President Rodrigo Duterte. </p>\n\n<p>The EDCA deal allows the US to rotate troops for prolonged stays as well as build and operate facilities at designated sites, most of which are expected to be in the country\u2019s north, closer to Taiwan, or along the South China Sea. </p>\n\n<p>Austin hailed the agreement as a \u201creally big deal,\u201d and it was seen as more evidence that Washington\u2019s long-promised pivot to Asia is finally underway. </p>\n\n<p>But in a joint briefing with Austin, Galvez was careful to refer to the four unnamed locations US forces would go to under the agreement as \u201cEDCA sites,\u201d not bases, and stressed that the deal was still contingent on consultations with local authorities. President Marcos later said Subic Bay isn\u2019t on the list of sites being considered, after a Philippine defense official said it was last year.</p>\n\n<p>The EDCA expansion \u201cis heavy on the hype, but wanting on the substance,\u201d said Rommel Ong, a retired rear admiral in the Philippine Navy who is now a professor at Ateneo de Manila University\u2019s School of Government. </p>\n\n<p>Governor Mamba says he believes hosting American troops would be a security risk for his province, located about 300 kilometers (200 miles) from Taiwan at the northern tip of Luzon island. He also fears it would torpedo a $7 billion Chinese infrastructure package he said could transform the otherwise sleepy province.</p>\n\n<p>In other communities, stories about mistreatment by visiting US troops in the past still resonate. The killing of a transgender Filipino in Subic Bay in 2014 by a US Marine on leave from a visiting warship sparked outrage and a renewed clamor for a review of the Philippines\u2019 military commitments.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLocal opposition probably is a concern, certainly,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former operations director at U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. \u201cThe US Navy was not very popular there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And then there\u2019s the fear of getting pulled too deep into a US-China conflict. That was behind the objections raised by President Marcos\u2019s sister, Senator Imee Marcos. The senator, who chairs the foreign relations committee and is known for her political independence, grilled Defense Secretary Galvez at a hearing on Wednesday. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are not volunteering to fight wars that are not our own,\u201d the senator said. The president\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks. </p>\n\n<p>Within Southeast Asia, not all leaders are comfortable with the US embrace. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim says welcoming military forces is the wrong approach to deescalating tensions. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt would be disconcerting if any force, East or West, starts showing military might or presence within Asean,\u201d Anwar said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel in the Philippines broadcast on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s all evidence of how President Marcos has to navigate the US-China relationship carefully. Like other regional leaders, he has an interest in maintaining ties with Beijing, his country\u2019s top trading partner. In January, Marcos visited President Xi Jinping, with the two sides agreeing to resume talks on joint oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. </p>\n\n<p>In the end, however, Marcos appears more open to the US than many experts expected. The president\u2019s remarks ruling out Subic Bay from the list of places expected to welcome more US troops may be more symbolic than substantive. US Navy ships still call there and American troops flow in for the annual Balikatan military exercises. </p>\n\n<p>Paulino \u2014 the Subic Bay authority\u2019s director \u2014 said it\u2019s time to move on. The area he oversees could benefit from more investment. The now-private shipyards struggle to find commissions renovating yachts, and limited tourism appeal has forced the local airport \u2014 built in the shape of an aircraft carrier \u2014 to darken its halls. </p>\n\n<p>Sitting in his offices overlooking the bay, Paulino said he told US Ambassador MaryKay L. Carlson late last year that negative feelings about the American presence are in the past.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI told her that there\u2019s no such thing here; no resentment, nothing whatsoever,\u201d he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
