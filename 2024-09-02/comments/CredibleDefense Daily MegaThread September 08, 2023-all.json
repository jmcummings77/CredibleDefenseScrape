As of Sept. 1, only one Su-25 jet, which flew to Machulishchy on July 25 and then to Lida on Aug. 31, remains in the country, the group said.\n\nRussia used the Belarusian territory, with the approval of Alexander Lukashenko's regime, to launch an unsuccessful offensive against Ukraine from the north last year, hoping to capture the capital of Kyiv.\n\nRecently, the number of Russian troops stationed in the country was steadily decreasing and in July, Ukrainian officials reported that Russia had withdrawn almost all of its troops.\n\nBelarus became a host to a number of Wagner Group mercenaries, who arrived following their short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin in late June. Although reports emerged that the contractors began to depart following their boss Yevgeny Prigozhin's death in a plane crash on Aug. 23, Minsk denied these claims, saying that the mercenaries will remain.\n\nLukashenko admits Russian troops invaded Ukraine through Belarus in 2022.",

The Russians said that one tank against eight repelled the attack, created a loud PR.\r  \nIn fact, this is a video of a difficult and bloody victory of Ukrainian troops, which shows how, despite errors in planning and implementation, the high heroism and skill of Ukrainian soldiers turned the tide of battle.\r  \nAccording to the information I gathered, the video shows an attack on the first day of the Ukrainian offensive on the southern front.\r  \nOn June 4, units of the 23rd mechanized brigade attacked Russian positions near the village of Novodarivka in the Zaporizhzhia region.\r  \nTwo tanks were the first in the column in the video, followed by six armored vehicles, which did not have any anti-tank weapons. That is, in fact, only two advanced tanks had the opportunity to engage in battle with a Russian tank. The Russian tank did not destroy all our equipment - most of the equipment was blown up by anti-tank mines. Unfortunately, the enemy fired well and was able to retreat. But then the video ends at the most interesting part - what are the results?\r  \nAnd then it was not so interesting to show the Russians. The crews and infantrymen of the 23rd brigade did not run away, but secured themselves in a position near the broken equipment and after some time went forward. That is, the Russian tank failed to repulse the attack.\r  \nAnd this was not the only direction of the attack on Novodarivka - there was also an attack on another flank. The 110th Territorial Defense Brigade also entered the battle for the village.\r  \nRussian infantry defended the village under the cover of minefields and with the support of three T-90A tanks, according to the testimony of our fighters. One of these Russian tanks was destroyed on the outskirts of Novodarivka by a grenade launcher of the 110th TRO brigade, the wreckage of this tank is now being photographed by all journalists. After this defeat, two other tanks escaped, including the crew that attacked our column.\r  \nAfter the Russian tanks abandoned their infantry in the village, the soldiers of the 23rd and 110th brigades defeated the Russians in a contact battle, the escape began, and already on the evening of June 4, Novodarivka was freed from the occupiers.\r  \nIn other words, the Russian video is one of the unsuccessful tragic episodes of a generally successful operation for us.\r  \nAnd now for my personal take on the mistakes and takeaways that I believe affected the outcome of this episode on video:\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, the command of the corps, which issued the order for the use of the 23rd brigade, did not take into account that it was a newly created brigade that had not been tested for coordination and use in real combat conditions. Planning must correspond to the actual capabilities of the troops.\r  \n\r  \nThere was insufficient interaction with the 110th Zaporizhzhya TRO brigade, which had been operating in the area for a long time, had a good command of the situation, and could inform about the location of minefields and the defense system. After all, the 110th brigade had already entered Novodarivka before. The offensive must be planned, relying on those who have a better command of the tactical situation.\r  \n\r  \nIt is obvious from the movement of the column of armored vehicles that their actions were not corrected from the drone, and our tankers did not receive a timely notification and target designation regarding the approach of a Russian tank, the presence of which was known, it was possible to detect it and direct our tanks to it. But, unfortunately, we suffered unjustified losses due to the lack of control of the battle. War experience shows that armored vehicle crews during defensive or offensive actions must have constant information about the enemy and be guided by drones. The task of identifying targets during a maneuver battle cannot be transferred exclusively to the crew of combat vehicles. It is not the number of tanks in a convoy, but the number of drones, the quality of surveillance and the speed of response to changes in the situation that create an advantage in modern combat.\r  \nA Russian video shows how difficult the liberation of Novodarivka was. And mistakes during this operation should not be forgotten, but conclusions should be drawn so as not to be repeated.\r  \nAnd each of the Ukrainian heroes who liberated the village and contributed to the victory deserve the highest honors of the state and society.\r  \nIf any of the participants in those battles would like to clarify the circumstances and add details, please write to the messenger.\"",

Russia&#39;s military is already so badly ruined that it will be generations before it&#39;s a legitimate challenge to NATO again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/russia-forces-ukraine-war-cavoli/index.html\">https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/russia-forces-ukraine-war-cavoli/index.html</a></p>\n\n<p>According to US own military, Russia is stronger today than it was pre invasion</p>\n</div>",

No equipment = worse army.

That's especially true in terms of high tech weapons, which Russia has basically no capacity to replace.

It's cool that they can put together cheap drones, but that doesn't change the fact that they have destroyed their military surplus significantly quicker than they can rebuild it.    That's most evidence by Russia's declining artillery advantage as their artillery is destroyed by superior Ukrainian counter battery fire and general wear and tear that can't be stopped.\n\nRussia's logistics are definitely becoming more ragged, especially as seen by their inability to stop the Ukrainian advance, and their total collapses in Kherson and Kharkiv.  \n\n>And I think you are wrong by a large factor.... even at its darkest moments, such as after 1917 and the civil war that followed, Russia was able to spring back up pretty quickly, historically speaking.

Ukraine could've remained a functional state by simply agreeing not to join NATO and providing some form of autonomy to Russian people in it. That's basically what Minsk was about. Ukraine chose not to take that road. Unfortunately for Ukraine prospects as functional state, the longer this thing goes on, the less likely they are to remain as such, if for no other reason that their own population has been leaving in mass and is unlikely to return short of comprehensive peace agreement\n\n\n> Russia can just leave, and Russia will continue to exist.

They have absolutely no agency.\n\nWasn't your entire point that given enough pressure Russia would decide to disengage? If the population has no agency, why would they? FWIW I disagree... even in autocratic states, arguably especially in autocratic states, population support is absolutely critical and there needs to be some narrative that keeps people together. In democracy, if you disagree with current government, you simply wait for next election. In autocracy, push too much and you may end up with military revolt.\n\n\n> As for the Ukrainian population; they understand that the war is truly existential, so I think it would be pretty foolish to bet on them deciding to accept Putin tearing their nation and society apart.\n\nExcept for all the people who fled the country. And all the people who avoid conscription. To be fair, it is the case that Ukrainian population largely supports the war for now, but it's not universal and it has been changing over time.  \n\nSee here for example: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100076/volodymyr-zelensky-s-approval-rating-ukraine/ Zelensky approval rating shot up after the war start, but has been trending down.\n\n> That's just not true.

It isn't like the argument is any different for the Ukrainian side. Surrendering to Putin after so many gave their lives to expel Russia from half of the territory they took is far more unthinkable.\n\nWell, that's kind of my point. Would the war end eventually? Sure. Would it end because Russians or Ukrainians decide \"nah not worth it\"? This feels incredibly unlikely. I think we are looking for either total military collapse and subsequent capitulation, or some form of freeze, really depending on which side gets exhausted first, or if both happen at the same time.\n\nMy personal opinion? Russia grinds it out WW1 style all the way to a victory, as NATO gets tired politically, and Ukraine exhausts available manpower. Freeze is also somewhat likely, but it's hard to see this happening any time soon. I don't see how Ukraine can win attrition war against Russia so Russian capitulation feels very unlikely to me, short of something entirely unexpected happening that turns the tables completely.",

The order came after the US raised the issue in several different forums, they said.\n\n>The study will assess various war scenarios and provide options for India in case a conflict breaks out, they said. Some Indian military commanders believe that strong statements may suffice as a response in case the war is short, but ultimately that will not be enough if the conflict drags on like Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the officials said.\n\n>India\u2019s preparation for a potential war over Taiwan shows how its policy of \u201cmulti-alignment\u201d will be tested in the event of a drastic deterioration of US-China ties. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has forged its own path on international relations, effectively hedging its bets by developing close ties to the US while refusing to join international sanctions on Russia.\n\n>Yet tensions with China have also flared along their disputed Himalayan border, contributing to a deterioration in relations that may have prompted President Xi Jinping to skip the Group of 20 summit this weekend in New Delhi. India has strengthened defense ties with the US in recent years, joining the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue along with Japan and Australia \u2014 a band of democracies intent on countering China\u2019s growing influence.\n\n>*One option the Indian military will study involves serving as a logistics hub to provide repair and maintenance facilities for allied warships and aircraft, as well as food, fuel and medical equipment for armies resisting China, the officials said. A more extreme scenario, they added, would assess the potential for India to get directly involved along their northern border, opening a new theater of war for China.*\n\n>While no deadline has been set to complete the study, the Indian military is under orders to finish it as soon as possible, one of the officials said. The options prepared will be available for Modi and other political leaders to make a final call on any action should the need arise, the official said.\n\n>India\u2019s Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t respond to emailed questions.

This is from a conference for military and industry collaboration that he has attended for the past two years.  It's a very informative listen that's well worth your time.\n\nTo summarize, current design philosophies for future vehicles are a huge conceptual leap away from the design philosophies that led to current armored vehicles.  This includes focusing on more core design aspects than just the traditional iron triangle of mobility, protection, and firepower.  As combat is getting faster, the time to go through the kill chain of detecting, identifying, and engaging the enemy needs to be reduced.\n\nIn the future the role of the crewman will be more one of managing in the vehicle as opposed to operating it.  Vehicle crewman currently receive large amounts of information for them to process from their sights/optics, comms/battle management system, and general situationally awareness.  These disparate systems generate a cognitive burden on the crewmen.  With future vehicles, the processing of information into intelligence will be handled by the system instead of the crewman.  The crewman will receive intelligence from the system for making decisions on.  Certain jobs/operations in a chain will be entirely handled by the computer system/AI.  Thus, the cognitive burden on the crewman would be reduced so that they can make decisions faster.\n\n\n\nWith the technology for achieving these previously mentioned design philosophies still in the technology demonstrator phase, upgrades to existing vehicles is still necessary.  Germany is looking at the Leopard 2A8 and KF51 Panther more as stop gap upgrades than as the future of their tank force.  The Bundeswehr is interested in pursuing a multi-platform concept where the required capabilities will be split across the different vehicles in a platoon sized element.\n\nIn my opinion, there's a strong argument to be made that there has been a period of developmental plateauing in armored vehicle design after the end of the Cold War.  A period where the upgrade potential for Cold War designs are being pushed to their limits.  However, the near future seems to hold a lot of potential for serious advancements and fundamental changes in armored vehicle design.",

Of course a tank could be improved with a modern engine, but not to the same extent a car would.\n\nMostly the engine and the rest of the powertrain. Aerodynamics play a role, but modern powertrain engineering is a lot improved over its counterparts just 10 years ago, to say nothing about longer timeframes.\n\nFor one big example as it pertains to tanks, modern cars have extremely good idle performance compared to a few decades in the past. That improvement comes from improved powertrain designs (up to and including hybrids, which allow the engine to be fully shut off without actually causing a delay when the gas pedal is pressed), and tanks idle a ton.\n\nOf course, trying to R&D a hybrid system for a tank wouldn't be cheap, and given the very small number of tanks in service, it is probably best just to pay for fuel. And even the combat logistics that entails!\n\nBut anyway, it is more of an \"R&D is expensive and budgets are limited\" story and less of an \"internal combustion engines are at theoretical limits\" story. If you punch in the parameters of an air-breathing gasoline engine into the Carnot equation, you will find that the theoretical limits are about 80% efficient. No production (or heck, experimental) engine gets anywhere close, but having real designs fall short of theoretical limits happens all the time.",

That improvement comes from improved powertrain designs (up to and including hybrids, which allow the engine to be fully shut off without actually causing a delay when the gas pedal is pressed), and tanks idle a ton.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, trying to R&amp;D a hybrid system for a tank wouldn&#39;t be cheap, and given the very small number of tanks in service, it is probably best just to pay for fuel. And even the combat logistics that entails!</p>\n\n<p>But anyway, it is more of an &quot;R&amp;D is expensive and budgets are limited&quot; story and less of an &quot;internal combustion engines are at theoretical limits&quot; story. If you punch in the parameters of an air-breathing gasoline engine into the Carnot equation, you will find that the theoretical limits are about 80% efficient. No production (or heck, experimental) engine gets anywhere close, but having real designs fall short of theoretical limits happens all the time.</p>\n</div>",

Judging from reports about how Russia ran Kherson before their withdrawal, it seems they are enforcing local control via the FSB and other internal security organizations rather than the military itself, or even via forces that can substitute for official MoD forces such as Rosgvardia. Russia has an extremely well-developed apparatus for internal political control, and they have been putting it to work in Ukraine. There's no reason to disrupt the one part of their system that works the way they want. Last, they are not facing an enormous rear area security problem for the most part. They've largely depopulated the occupied territories of military-aged men, and in many areas the Russians are actually still supported by much of the remaining population. So it's not as if they are diverting large numbers of combat troops to securing rear areas.\n\n> Repair vehicles and organize supplies too?\n\nRepairing vehicles is skilled labor, and specialized to the vehicles in question.

Judging from reports about how Russia ran Kherson before their withdrawal, it seems they are enforcing local control via the FSB and other internal security organizations rather than the military itself, or even via forces that can substitute for official MoD forces such as Rosgvardia. Russia has an extremely well-developed apparatus for internal political control, and they have been putting it to work in Ukraine. There&#39;s no reason to disrupt the one part of their system that works the way they want. Last, they are not facing an enormous rear area security problem for the most part. They&#39;ve largely depopulated the occupied territories of military-aged men, and in many areas the Russians are actually still supported by much of the remaining population. So it&#39;s not as if they are diverting large numbers of combat troops to securing rear areas.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Repair vehicles and organize supplies too?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Repairing vehicles is skilled labor, and specialized to the vehicles in question.

        "body": "Was the article regarding UN and Putin \"Grain deal\" in Bild (lol) by everyone's favorite Julian R\u00f6pcke already discussed here? Should make people's blood pressure go into overdrive.\n\n[https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/09/8/7418983/](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/09/8/7418983/)\n\n\"The UN is currently conducting secret negotiations with the Russian Federation to reach a deal in which the key sanctions imposed after the beginning of its large-scale invasion of Ukraine will be lifted from Vladimir Putin\u2019s terrorist regime in exchange for reviving the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nSource: This was reported by Bild, which has obtained a secret letter from UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, dated 28 August.\n\nQuote: \"A secret letter from UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres shows how far the UN is ready to go to restore the grain deal with the warmonger Putin,\" the newspaper writes.\n\nThe letter from Guterres, which Bild calls \"explosive\", proposes \"four specific cornerstones of the agreement between the UN Secretariat and the Russian Federation\", which should \"lead to the continuation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative\".\n\n\"All four points are important, since their implementation would meet all the requirements of Vladimir Putin\u2019s terrorist regime and reward his missile attacks on Ukrainian civilian targets,\" Bild writes.\n\nGuterres' proposals are as follows:\n\n**A Russian state-owned bank is to be reconnected to SWIFT**\n\n**To circumvent the sanctions, the UN Secretary-General proposes to use a specially founded subsidiary of a sanctioned Russian bank, RSHB Capital SA.**\n\n**This will allow the Kremlin-controlled company to \"take on the role of an interface and provide technical services for payment transactions without playing the role of a bank, so it does not need a banking licence under Luxembourg law.\"**\n\n**\"Simply put: the head of the UN wants to activate a fake bank that will bypass EU sanctions against Russian banks,\" writes Bild.**\n\nMoreover, the UN has EU support for these plans.\n\nBild contacted the European Commission, which is responsible for the implementation of sanctions, and an EC representative confirmed that \"the EU has expressed to Russia, through the UN, its openness to seeking a more permanent, constructive solution through the designated subsidiary of the Russian Agricultural Bank, which allows SWIFT payments in accordance with EU sanctions on agricultural transactions.\"\n\nFinancial services provider SWIFT also indirectly confirmed this in response to Bild's enquiry: \"We are aware of the high-level discussions currently taking place around the Black Sea Grain Initiative and are closely monitoring developments.\"\n\n**\"So the UN and the EU are working on a \u2018legal\u2019 way to bypass the sanctions with respect to SWIFT for the sanctioned Russian Agricultural Bank,\" the newspaper writes.**\n\nThe UN is willing to insure Russian ships against Ukrainian attacks\n\nWithin this point, Guterres is seriously proposing to Lavrov that Russian ships should be insured against Ukrainian attacks in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea.\n\nHe writes: \"A UN-funded insurance company for Russian exports of food and fertilisers would be working with Lloyd's within 4-6 weeks.\"\n\nAs well as \"cargo insurance for Russian exports of food and fertilisers\", the UN head is also offering Casco and P&I insurance.\n\nCasco insurance is comprehensive insurance against external factors affecting ships used for transportation, while P&I is comprehensive insurance of liability for losses caused to third parties.\n\nGuterres promises the Russian foreign minister that \"the United Nations will support insurance to emphasise the importance of Russian exports to global food security and increase the number of market participants with the ultimate goal of reducing insurance costs for Russian exporters.\"\n\nBild contacted the British ship insurer Lloyd's, but they replied: \"No comment.\"\n\n**Frozen funds must be given back to Russia**\n\nUnder this point, Guterres is sending Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov an offer to help the Putin regime recover assets in the EU that have been frozen by the sanctions.\n\nHe writes: \"The United Nations may continue to help unfreeze the frozen assets of Russian fertiliser companies in the European Union.\"\n\nLike a kind of guide to sanctions evasion, the UN head tells Russia's chief propagandist that he should \"provide a list of specific accounts or assets\", and that \"Russian fertiliser companies should apply to the relevant national authorities of the EU for the appropriate exemptions\".\n\nGuterres promises that \"the United Nations will work with the relevant national authorities and EU bodies to address these requests\".\n\nPermission for Russian ships to dock in countries such as Germany to be reinstated\n\nFinally, in the last point, Guterres proposes to \"ensure effective access for Russian ships carrying food and fertilisers to EU ports through fast-track port permits\".\n\nThe UN chief notes: \"The United Nations stands ready to explore further options to facilitate access for Russian ships to EU ports for agricultural trade, including simplified procedures for issuing relevant permits, particularly before departure for Russian ports.\"\n\nTo this end, UN Secretary-General Guterres has \"held discussions with the European Commission and selected port authorities (Germany, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands)\".\n\nBild asked Germany\u2019s Federal Foreign Office in Berlin whether it was working with the UN to facilitate Russian ships entering German ports.\n\nResponding to a question from Bild, the EU Commission in Brussels  ambiguously stated that EU sanctions provide for \"targeted exemptions to allow Russian ships access to EU ports as required for the purchase, import or transport of agricultural products and food, including wheat and fertilisers\".\n\nOn 5 September, Bild asked the office of UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres about his outrageous letter to the Russian Foreign Minister.\n\nThere has been no response.\n\nBild says Russia's leadership is now carefully studying the UN proposals and has not yet agreed to them, as the Kremlin considers them \"too good to be true\" and has doubts about the \"technical feasibility\" of the concessions offered.\n\nUkrainian government circles say that Guterres' proposals are an \"incredible insult\" and a \"reward for Russia's aggressive behaviour\" from the UN.\n\nA senior government official stated that \"under no circumstances\" would the Ukrainian government resume the grain deal with Russia under these conditions, nor would it give up its \"right under international law\" to monitor Russian naval vessels and illegally built structures such as the Crimean Bridge in order to pursue the offensive.\"",

the newspaper writes.</p>\n\n<p>The letter from Guterres, which Bild calls &quot;explosive&quot;, proposes &quot;four specific cornerstones of the agreement between the UN Secretariat and the Russian Federation&quot;, which should &quot;lead to the continuation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;All four points are important, since their implementation would meet all the requirements of Vladimir Putin\u2019s terrorist regime and reward his missile attacks on Ukrainian civilian targets,&quot; Bild writes.</p>\n\n<p>Guterres&#39; proposals are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Russian state-owned bank is to be reconnected to SWIFT</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>To circumvent the sanctions, the UN Secretary-General proposes to use a specially founded subsidiary of a sanctioned Russian bank, RSHB Capital SA.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This will allow the Kremlin-controlled company to &quot;take on the role of an interface and provide technical services for payment transactions without playing the role of a bank, so it does not need a banking licence under Luxembourg law.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Simply put: the head of the UN wants to activate a fake bank that will bypass EU sanctions against Russian banks,&quot; writes Bild.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the UN has EU support for these plans.</p>\n\n<p>Bild contacted the European Commission, which is responsible for the implementation of sanctions, and an EC representative confirmed that &quot;the EU has expressed to Russia, through the UN, its openness to seeking a more permanent, constructive solution through the designated subsidiary of the Russian Agricultural Bank, which allows SWIFT payments in accordance with EU sanctions on agricultural transactions.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Financial services provider SWIFT also indirectly confirmed this in response to Bild&#39;s enquiry: &quot;We are aware of the high-level discussions currently taking place around the Black Sea Grain Initiative and are closely monitoring developments.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;So the UN and the EU are working on a \u2018legal\u2019 way to bypass the sanctions with respect to SWIFT for the sanctioned Russian Agricultural Bank,&quot;

The HAWKs were developed in the 1950s and were a core component of western AD all the way up until 1990, for example. Its a decent missile, but not a Patriot. A number of spectacular failures in gun platforms, the SGT. York and VADS on the M113 chassis, further put NATO behind. MANPADS were good, but outside the Gepard there was not every really success in bridging that super SHORAD and LRAD. Part of that is institutional (fucking up dev projects so bad you sour the milk) part of that is technological (Russia has always made good ground launched missiles) and part of that is doctrinal (we have great Air Forces, maybe they can pick up that midrange slack). Also worth considering that the majority of these late Cold War systems were **not** designed with BM intercept in mind. Only the Patriot was, and it was DOGSHIT at it in Desert Storm. Also ruined *that* program. \n\nIntervening you also had the nearly 20 year long collapse of credible peer threats. The collapse of the USSR, the relative friendliness of China before Xi, and the lack of any other real late-Cold War style military force in the 3rd world meant certain things could be ignored. F-15s with AAMRAMs were good enough to destroy (almost without loss) any Air Force in the world until relatively recently. So why do you need AD, except perhaps to cover a long range gap in fighters (Patriot) or once you get serious about BMs, cover that launch and low orbit envelope (THAAD)? The GWOT placed an even greater emphasis on this, why build a BUK-like system? Does the Taliban have an Air Force? Should we be building GBAD against enemies that dont, it seems, exist, or putting armor on Humvees because guys are dying and the Bush Admin is catching heat for it even on Fox? Spoilers, its going to be #2. The GWOT was hugely expensive not just in terms of development dollars, which were shifted from big battle to COIN, but also in terms of day to day operating costs as you put 100k+ troops in country in Iraq. Suddenly there is less food on the plate for what appears to be secondary considerations. Then add on the single worst piece of defense policy made in the last 50 years, Budget Sequestration. Getting a bunch of dipshits on Congress who are too chicken shit to even take votes on cuts to go into a room and make military decisions, without military assistance, and for entirely political reasons on what should get cut and not cut. It was HUGE, and it killed even the limited cheap AD solutions like Avenger. It was hitting reset on programs which were struggling to get off the ground in the first place.\n\nAnd meanwhile Europe was living in splendid bliss where all they had to contribute to Afghanistan was SOF and artillery, their skies were protected by US ABM technology, and they could simultaneously cut systems they didn't think they needed (which were mostly just lingering Cold War relics like the widely exported Gepard) and also complain about American militarism. And now here we are, with a need, but also with the legacy of total inaction on the issue. We have solutions which may not have worked, but which are inherited from very old doctrine meant for a totally different war, and are realizing that the situation in Ukraine is different even than the war we had planned to fight against our own peer foes.
