Proceeds from crude oil and petroleum products \u2014 which accounted for over two thirds of energy tax revenue last month \u2014 fell by 48% to 361 billion rubles, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\n> The drop in contributions to the nation\u2019s budget comes after the price of Urals crude \u2014 Russia\u2019s key export blend \u2014 has fallen to a significant discount compared to the Brent benchmark. The European Union banned most seaborne imports of crude and petroleum products from Russia, and the Group of Seven industrialized nations imposed a price cap.\n\n> With the price of Urals oil averaging just over half of its value a year ago, Russia is seeking to gradually narrow the discount to Brent it uses to calculate taxes in an effort to boost revenue amid sanctions. Energy proceeds account for around at third of nation\u2019s coffers, which are under pressure amid the rising cost of financing the war in Ukraine.\n\n> Gas revenue fell almost 42% in February from a year ago to 161 billion rubles, as even higher proceeds from the mineral extraction tax failed to make up for losses from export duties. Budget revenue from gas export duties fell 81% to 40 billion rubles after nation\u2019s gas giant Gazprom PJSC reduced pipeline flows to Europe, historically its largest market, and the fuel price has significantly declined amid warmer-than-usual weather.\n\n> Proceeds from the mineral extraction tax on gas rose 86% to 121 billion rubles, gaining from a temporary increase of the tax for Gazprom by 50 billion rubles per month in 2023-2025.\n\nRussia will never succeed to replace Europe as energy buyer. Firstly, China and India are much further away from the energy sources. The cost of building Power of Siberia was insanely high, and there will never be pipelines to India. Transportation has a price.\n\nSecondly, buying energy from Russia was an end in itself. Europe heavily subsidized gas to make it competitive with other sources. China and India don't, so Russia must sell it much cheaper.\n\nThirdly, China cares a lot about energy independence. Russia had to pay for Power of Siberia in full, because why would China invest in that instead of its own production? Meanwhile Europe happily paid for the Nord Streams. Who will pay for Power of Siberia 2? Probably nobody, hence the project seems to be stuck at the drawing board.",

If you're looking to reduce the signal/noise ratio, it helps to increase the noise and decrease the signal at the same time.

A month before, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 top leaders skipped a high-profile China-Arab summit in Riyadh. \n\n>Prince Mohammed and U.A.E. President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan steered clear of each other\u2019s events intentionally, Gulf officials said, even as the rulers of Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and others attended. The snubs exposed a growing rift between neighboring U.S. security partners that for years marched in lockstep on Middle East foreign policy. \n\n>Still formally allies, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have diverged on several fronts, competing for foreign investment and influence in global oil markets and clashing on the direction of the Yemen war. The disagreements once unfolded behind closed doors but are increasingly spilling out into the open, threatening to reorder alliances in the energy-rich Persian Gulf at a time when Iran is trying to exert more sway across the region and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has raised crude prices and roiled OPEC decision-making. \n\n>U.A.E. national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al Nahyan, who is close to Prince Mohammed, has repeatedly traveled to the Saudi kingdom to meet its 37-year-old de facto leader, but that has failed to ease tensions, said people familiar with the trips. On at least one occasion after the January summit in Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Tahnoun couldn\u2019t secure a meeting with the Saudi crown prince, some of the people said.\n\n>The U.A.E.\u2019s Sheikh Mohamed, 61 years old, was once the Saudi crown prince\u2019s mentor, bonding a few years ago on an overnight camping trip in the vast Saudi desert, accompanied by trained falcons and a small entourage, The Wall Street Journal has reported. But more recently, the two men have drifted apart as they offer divergent visions of leadership, and with Sheikh Mohamed avoiding the scrutiny faced by Prince Mohammed.\n\n>>\u201cUp until a few years ago, this sort of division and openly pursuing objectives that are counter to what their brothers are pursuing was unheard of,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, senior adviser for the Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group. \u201cNow it\u2019s becoming increasingly normal.\u201d\n\n>Emirati officials declined to comment. Saudi officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n\n>In a tweet in February, Anwar Gargash, an Emirati foreign-policy adviser to Sheikh Mohamed, reaffirmed the U.A.E.\u2019s unity with Saudi Arabia and said reports about shifts in Gulf alliances are wrong and create divisions at a time when the region needs solidarity.\n\n>The most intense disagreement is over Yemen, where the Saudis and Emiratis led an Arab military coalition that intervened in 2015. The civil war has left the country fractured between Iran-backed Houthi rebels controlling the north and an internationally recognized government in much of the south. \nThe U.A.E. pulled most of its ground forces from Yemen in 2019 but still fears being sidelined from discussions about its future as Saudi Arabia pursues direct talks with Houthi rebels on ending the war, Gulf officials said. The U.A.E. wants to maintain a strategic foothold on the country\u2019s southern coast and project power into the Red Sea to secure sea routes from its ports to the rest of the world, Gulf officials said. \n\n>In December, the U.A.E. signed a security agreement with the Saudi-backed Yemeni government allowing Emirati forces to intervene in the country in the case of an imminent threat, train Yemeni forces in the U.A.E. and deepen intelligence cooperation, according to Saudi, Emirati and Western officials. The U.A.E. is also seeking to build a military base and runway on an island in the Bab al-Mandeb strait at the southern end of the Red Sea, according to Gulf officials.\n\n>Saudi officials privately objected to the security agreement and plans for the base, Gulf officials said, and view the Emiratis as working against Riyadh\u2019s main objectives of securing its 800-mile border and stopping Houthi drone and missile attacks. \n\n>In response, the Saudis deployed Sudanese forces from the Arab military coalition to areas near Emirati operations, which Emirati officials saw as an intimidation tactic, Gulf officials said. \n\n>In December, when Sheikh Mohamed didn\u2019t attend the China summit in Riyadh, Saudi officials say they interpreted it as a sign of Emirati displeasure over the rising competition in Yemen. In Sheikh Mohamed\u2019s place, the ruler of the small emirate of Fujairah attended the summit featuring Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n>Two of the biggest oil producers in the world, the Saudis and Emiratis have also had behind-closed-doors arguments over energy issues.\n\n>Within the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the U.A.E. is obligated to pump much less than it is capable of, hurting its oil revenue. It has long pushed to pump more oil, but the Saudis have said no, OPEC delegates have said.\n\n>Now, said Emirati officials say, the U.A.E. is having an internal debate about leaving OPEC, a decision that would shake the cartel and undermine its power in global oil markets.\n\n>The Emiratis clashed with the Saudis last October when OPEC+\u2014a 13-nation group that includes OPEC and 10 other countries, including Russia\u2014decided to dramatically reduce oil production to prop up crude prices. \n\n>In public, the U.A.E. supported the production cut. But U.S. officials said the Emiratis told them privately that they wanted to pump more, in line with Washington\u2019s wishes, but faced resistance from Saudi Arabia. Since then, the U.A.E. has privately pushed OPEC+ to let it produce more, Gulf energy officials said.\n\n>The Emiratis are \u201cworried about a Saudi that works against their interests,\u201d said Ms. Esfandiary. She said the Saudis are concerned the U.A.E. poses a threat to Saudi dominance in the Gulf.\n\n>The Saudi-U.A.E. rift isn\u2019t as serious as Qatar\u2019s dispute with its neighbors, which saw diplomatic, trade and travel ties severed from mid-2017 until early 2021. The Saudis and the Emiratis continue to participate in joint military exercises, but the heyday of their alignment is over, analysts said.\n\n>The divergence began after the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government agents, which made the Emiratis reconsider how close they should be to him, Emirati officials said. In 2019, the Saudis felt abandoned in Yemen when Abu Dhabi began pulling its forces. A U.A.E. deal establishing relations with Israel generated more friction.\n\n>Riyadh\u2019s quick reconciliation with Doha after it pushed to end the boycott in early 2021 alarmed Abu Dhabi, which had originally pushed for isolating Qatar and wanted to continue the blockade, officials and diplomats have previously said. The Saudis have leaned on foreign companies to move their regional headquarters to the kingdom, challenging the position of Dubai, the Emirati city-state that is the Middle East\u2019s international business hub.\n\n>A potential realignment in the Gulf seemed to take shape in November when the king of Bahrain, long seen as a Saudi client state, appeared at a Formula One race in Abu Dhabi alongside Sheikh Mohamed on the same weekend the Saudi prince attended the soccer World Cup opening ceremony in Doha with the Qatari ruler.\n\n>Last month the U.A.E. arranged a phone call between the leaders of Qatar and Bahrain, which have had frosty ties for years.

Genuine fear of escalation, however small the risk.\n\n2. Limited stockpiles of certain munitions.\n\n3. Lack of coordination in terms of who should take the lead on certain things.

Though the battle started out with many believing the Russians would try a bold flanking maneuver to cut the salient at the shoulders, the Izyum axis went nowhere and there was no real southern axis beyond Popasna. But then the Russians began attacking along a broad front, not continuous but here and there daily, trying to off balance the Ukrainians. They started attacking the urban outskirts of Severodonetsk so it became clear it was just a matter of time until the Russians ground their way to the city. The Ukrainians chose to defend it at all costs, it was supposed to be Mariupol 2, the Ukrainians figured the urban terrain would act as such a force multiplier that it would stymy the Russians for quite some time, bloody them heavily, delay the overall campaign and act as further erosion as part of a strategy of attrition (the closest thing they had to a strategy over the spring summer). \n\nUnfortunately, when the Russians actually attacked the city, they pushed the Ukrainians back to the far western edge within 4 days, happening by very late May. That was unacceptable, so the Ukrainians reinforced it. That led to a counterattack around June 4 that took back part of the city, but a Russian counter to the counterattack pushed the Ukrainians back to the western edge of the city again (home to another large industrial factory complex with deep underground shelters and tunnels, common in ex-Soviet Cold War architecture). That resulted in a week long stalemate, but then in mid June the last bridge out of Severodonetsk was destroyed by the Russians, and the Ukrainians were gone within a week, with them saying afterwards it was the loss of the last bridge that triggered their retreat.\n\nGo back to early May and Popasna is lost, Ukrainians are forced to fall back. Everyone loves to talk about how small of a city it was, but check out [the topography](https://en-us.topographic-map.com/map-fhcvkl/Popasna/). The Ukrainians retreated to fall back lines behind it but then the Russians broke through that entire sector and advanced deep. That was going on through mid to late May, and it was THAT which caused the loss of the Luhansk portion of the Donbas salient (there were some more trouble spots, but none as devastating as the Popasna breakthrough).\n\nWhen the southern flank of the salient collapsed through mid June, a slow but obvious event that was blatantly obvious it was happening but without a retreat until July 3, that's when there was a lot of similar doom posting.\n\nAfter the lines in that sector shifted, the Russians in that sector that had been in the deeper part of that sector had two weeks to move 30-50 km westwards, reorganize, and prep for further offensive ops against the Siversk-Bakhmut line, hence the operational pause. At the end of that two weeks, the telegraphing of the Kherson counteroffensive caused the Russians to send a significant amount of overall forces from the Donbas Salient to reinforce Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.\n\nThat event caused them to thin their lines, to commit tactical reserves, to place paramilitary security forces in front line positions, and to cut a significant amount of their offensives. The axis against Bakhmut remained active, probes to the west and northwest of Sloviansk continued. Almost nothing happened along the Donets between Sloviansk and Siversk. And east of Siversk wasn't quiet but not at all hot either.\n\nIn addition, in late June, due to severe losses in the Donbas Salient, it was reinforced by numerous brigades sent from other regional commands plus the strategic reserve.

All of his administration's actions up to the invasion were relatively low effort and reactive: publicize available intelligence, keep issuing public statements and releasing intelligence to keep the topic of a potential war in people's minds, and threaten to sanction Russia if they invade.

She was furious. Her country was in ruins. She had lost dozens of friends. She hadn\u2019t seen her daughter more than a couple of times in the last year, but all the talk was of a long war in Ukraine. \u201cA long war is a disaster for us!\u201d Hopko nearly shouted. \u201cA disaster!\u201d How much longer could **Ukraine** survive in a war that had destroyed its economy, killed tens of thousands of civilians, displaced millions, and, **as the Estonian minister of defense told me, racked up a quarter million dead and wounded soldiers**? Sure, the Russians had similar numbers, but they had a far larger pool to draw from. **Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Odessa, told me grimly that Ukraine was facing a real manpower shortage. There were no more volunteers, he said. The ones who had joined up a year ago were dead, and there were no new ones queueing up to take their place.** \n  \n\nThat must be the largest casualty estimate from a non-Russian source yet, comparable to Western estimates of Russian losses. As for the lack of volunteers, this explains more forceful mobilization practices mentioned [here](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/26/ukraine-finds-stepping-up-mobilisation-is-not-so-easy) and depicted in videos coming out of Ukrainian cities lately.  \n\n> The longer I was in Munich, the more I understood some people\u2019s private confusion with the Biden administration\u2019s line on Ukraine. While in flight to Munich, Politico\u2019s Alex Ward and Paul McLeary typed up a story that Alex got while waiting to board the plane with half of D.C.\u2019s foreign policy establishment. **On a phone call with the city\u2019s think tankers, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said that Crimea is Putin\u2019s red line and that the United States was conveying to the Ukrainians that making a push to retake the peninsula militarily wouldn\u2019t be wise.** \u201cOverall the message is that there is a lot of uncertainty on how things will go from here with real questions about capacity of either side to make big gains,\u201d one of the people on the call told Alex and Paul. \n> \n> A few days before the conference, a senior administration official told the Washington Post that, given the political realities in D.C., more aid might be harder and harder to come by. The Boeberts and Greenes and Gaetzes in Congress aren\u2019t just very loud, they have a fair bit of power in a House where their party has the slimmest of majorities. \u201c\u2018As long as it takes\u2019 pertains to the amount of conflict,\u201d an anonymous White House official told the Post. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pertain to the amount of assistance.\u201d The official stressed that, \u201cWe will continue to try to impress upon them that we can\u2019t do anything and everything forever.\u201d\n> \n> In November, the White House had to publicly distance itself from Joint Chiefs chairman General Mark Milley\u2019s comments that, given the state of the battlefield, Ukraine was unlikely to achieve its aims\u2014restoring its 1991 borders\u2014militarily. It was time to start talking about talking. Now, three months later, it seems that the White House is starting to come around to Milley\u2019s position, at least more publicly. And since we\u2019re talking about big concepts that fit into one German word, there\u2019s a fair bit of schadenfreude in the Milley camp, though I don\u2019t know the German word for the bitterness they feel at being hung out to dry when they believe everyone basically agreed with Milley even then.\n> \n> \u201cEveryone here is talking about exit ramps, but very, very quietly, just nibbling around the edges,\u201d one high-profile American conference attendee told me. \u201cYou\u2019ll get slammed if you say anything publicly. You have to maintain a public front of unity.\u201d But the talk of exit ramps was there, only one year in. I asked this attendee what was really happening under the happy talk of a unified front. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and a feeling that time is not on Ukraine\u2019s side,\u201d they responded, in part because of political uncertainty in the U.S. and the understanding that Europe still needed Washington to be its cat-herder. \u201cWithout the U.S., does the E.U. hold together on Ukraine? Yes, but not at the same levels. Does Ukraine collapse [if aid levels decrease without the U.S.]? Probably. And Putin knows that. He\u2019s waiting us out.\u201d\n> \n> I could see why Hopko was so angry at the divergence between what Western leaders declared publicly and what they said privately. There were a couple off the record events I went to, so I can\u2019t say who they were with, but the distinct sense I was starting to get from them and as  I left Munich was that for all the talk of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d the West was fundamentally not comfortable helping Ukraine to win on Ukraine\u2019s terms. There was a very realistic and accurate assessment that Putin\u2019s nuclear threats were not empty and that he very well might act on them if the Russian military collapsed or if Ukrainians took Crimea.

                                    "body": "I wrote [this in May](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/comment/ia48yrz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I think most of it is still pretty valid. \n\n>Enact a no sht draft. They were already using conscription before the war, conscript more. The more in uniform the more they control them. They don't all need to be combat arms, but society has to be mobilized in a controlled manner, and having the military do it makes it easy, as it's an existing structured organization.\n\n>Likewise enact Stop Loss, nobody is getting out besides special exceptions.\n\n>Unfck their logistics. Enact a gddmn Proxy Czar if they have to but they can't keep begging for sh*t to have it sitting in western Ukraine and then b*tching that the troops in battle don't have enough. Someone highly competent needs to be put in the position to fix that and given the authority to plow through opposition and red tape.\n\n>Train up the TDF as best as possible, try to turn them into legitimate credible soldiers. Those in combat arms need to be focused entirely on conventional offensive ops, the TDF's days of small unit harassing ambushes are over. Pick and choose based on harsh selection to separate who goes where. Most TDF were doing combat arms, a lot of them don't belong in combat arms.\n\n>Use foreign troops wisely. Some of them have very valuable skills and shouldn't be used as cannon fodder. It's also very dangerous to use them that way because when they leave they can control the narrative of how fcked up things are. Ukraine is going balls to the wall to control OPSEC but they can't do that if foreigners are leaving to then sht talk to the media or write their books that talk down UAF abilities.\n\n>Start rotating combat units out of Ukraine whenever possible into \"training centers\" in Poland and elsewhere in NATO to give them a break. They can't be attacked there, it's a safe haven. Allow them to get drunk, get laid, decompress. Try to avert the worst of PTSD, as psych casualties in a war like this are going to be high. While they're there, that's the time to replace equipment and induct new replacements into those units, give them a few weeks doing training together on specific mission essential tasks to develop cohesion, then they go back into the fight.\n\n>Bring back division and corps HQs. As of now the UAF has operational command zones and under them a absolute fck ton of brigades, independent battalions, and independent companies. That's a recipe for disaster. If they can't find the officers, start begging the west for help, asking for retired officers to serve as staff officers with each assigned their own translator. I bet a whole lot will bite and sign up, one last hurrah to finally kill Russians despite their bad knees.\n\n>Train the combat brigades all HEAVILY in urban warfare. This will pay off. Possibly even use a few brigades as test beds for urban warfare to use in the first battles in the counteroffensives and then send half out to use as cadre for everyone else, while the remainder become dedicated urban specialists that the division and corps commanders can use for the toughest assignments. Task organize and arm them for that fight.\n\n>Invest HEAVILY in engineering units who specialize in mines, especially for mechanized forces. The Russians are going to seed the ground they control with probably millions of AP and AT mines. The Ukrainians can try to deal with that now or later but either way they're going to deal with them. Better now.\n\n>Ukraine SOF units are to take on duties of special reconnaissance sabotage, and unconventional warfare behind enemy lines exclusively. To conduct successful offensives means more than just intel from US provided SIGINT and IMINT plus drones, they need deep reconnaissance to find out where the Russians are strong and where they're weak.

They were already using conscription before the war, conscript more. The more in uniform the more they control them. They don&#39;t all need to be combat arms, but society has to be mobilized in a controlled manner, and having the military do it makes it easy, as it&#39;s an existing structured organization.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise enact Stop Loss, nobody is getting out besides special exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>Unfck their logistics. Enact a gddmn Proxy Czar if they have to but they can&#39;t keep begging for sh<em>t to have it sitting in western Ukraine and then b</em>tching that the troops in battle don&#39;t have enough. Someone highly competent needs to be put in the position to fix that and given the authority to plow through opposition and red tape.</p>\n\n<p>Train up the TDF as best as possible, try to turn them into legitimate credible soldiers. Those in combat arms need to be focused entirely on conventional offensive ops, the TDF&#39;s days of small unit harassing ambushes are over. Pick and choose based on harsh selection to separate who goes where. Most TDF were doing combat arms, a lot of them don&#39;t belong in combat arms.</p>\n\n<p>Use foreign troops wisely. Some of them have very valuable skills and shouldn&#39;t be used as cannon fodder. It&#39;s also very dangerous to use them that way because when they leave they can control the narrative of how fcked up things are. Ukraine is going balls to the wall to control OPSEC but they can&#39;t do that if foreigners are leaving to then sht talk to the media or write their books that talk down UAF abilities.</p>\n\n<p>Start rotating combat units out of Ukraine whenever possible into &quot;training centers&quot; in Poland and elsewhere in NATO to give them a break. They can&#39;t be attacked there, it&#39;s a safe haven. Allow them to get drunk, get laid, decompress. Try to avert the worst of PTSD, as psych casualties in a war like this are going to be high. While they&#39;re there, that&#39;s the time to replace equipment and induct new replacements into those units, give them a few weeks doing training together on specific mission essential tasks to develop cohesion, then they go back into the fight.</p>\n\n<p>Bring back division and corps HQs. As of now the UAF has operational command zones and under them a absolute fck ton of brigades, independent battalions, and independent companies. That&#39;s a recipe for disaster. If they can&#39;t find the officers, start begging the west for help, asking for retired officers to serve as staff officers with each assigned their own translator. I bet a whole lot will bite and sign up, one last hurrah to finally kill Russians despite their bad knees.</p>\n\n<p>Train the combat brigades all HEAVILY in urban warfare. This will pay off. Possibly even use a few brigades as test beds for urban warfare to use in the first battles in the counteroffensives and then send half out to use as cadre for everyone else, while the remainder become dedicated urban specialists that the division and corps commanders can use for the toughest assignments. Task organize and arm them for that fight.</p>\n\n<p>Invest HEAVILY in engineering units who specialize in mines, especially for mechanized forces. The Russians are going to seed the ground they control with probably millions of AP and AT mines. The Ukrainians can try to deal with that now or later but either way they&#39;re going to deal with them. Better now.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine SOF units are to take on duties of special reconnaissance sabotage, and unconventional warfare behind enemy lines exclusively. To conduct successful offensives means more than just intel from US provided SIGINT and IMINT plus drones, they need deep reconnaissance to find out where the Russians are strong and where they&#39;re weak. This doesn&#39;t just need to mean MACV-SOG type recon, or expert SOF sappers probing minefields to find gaps, it can mean a team inserted to link up with Ukraine partsan cells to do some OSS type stuff. They also need to organize, train, and lead partisan cells, while also arranging them to be properly armed.</p>\n\n<p>Find out how to defeat Russian drones, ask for that stuff from NATO, and build a legit counter drone company in every brigade. Also, invest more in their own drones.</p>\n\n<p>This will all help, though I doubt they&#39;ll do that well attacking without air superiority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
