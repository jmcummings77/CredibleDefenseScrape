As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Thhe F-35 is more capable, but the program was less ambitious in the sense that it was built upon existing technologies and continuous programs.

In return, Pakistan expected the group to help rein in an offshoot at home.\n\n>Almost two years later, relations between the Taliban and Pakistan have soured, terrorist attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan have jumped and some Taliban leaders are even seeking to establish ties with Pakistan\u2019s archrival, India. \n\n>The increased instability is adding to the turmoil in a Pakistan buffeted by simultaneous economic and political crises, as the country edges closer to a default, inflation rages and the military instigates a sweeping crackdown against former premier Imran Khan\u2019s political party.\n\n>Pakistan saw the Taliban as deeply connected to the TTP and able to persuade it to stop its attacks, people familiar with the matter said. The TTP has long said it wants to overthrow the government in Islamabad.\n\n>But some Taliban factions strongly oppose helping Pakistan\u2019s efforts to fight the TTP, and many are upset the government in Islamabad didn\u2019t recognize their regime, according to people familiar with the situation. Hundreds of Taliban fighters also joined the TTP to pursue another holy war, they said.\n\n>Pakistan made a \u201cremarkable\u201d miscalculation, said Farid Mamundzay, Afghanistan\u2019s ambassador to India, a holdover from the country\u2019s previous regime who doesn\u2019t represent the Taliban.\n\n>The TTP carried out the most militant attacks on Pakistani soil last year since 2018. This January, the group killed at least 100 people in a suicide bombing in the northwestern city of Peshawar \u2014 one of the deadliest attacks in its history. Four people were killed in a suicide car bomb on May 24, which hasn\u2019t been claimed by the TTP or other militants.\n\n>Some key Taliban members want the group to distance itself from Pakistan and show its independence, people familiar with the matter said. They include Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Afghanistan\u2019s deputy prime minister for economic affairs who spent years in a Pakistani jail after he was captured in 2010 during the war with the US, and Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the defense minister and son of Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar, the people said.\n\n>**Yaqoob has publicly been leading efforts to build relations with India, including urging the Indian government to train Taliban forces.**\n\n>Others within the Taliban take different positions. Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada has said Pakistan\u2019s establishment is \u201cun-Islamic\u201d and founded on the legacy of its British colonial rulers, according to a January report by the United States Institute of Peace.\n\n>Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister and leader of a powerful faction, brokered a cease-fire last year between Pakistan and the TTP in a bid to secure a lasting peace, people familiar with the matter said. It lasted about six months.\n\n>Some of the Taliban fighters helping the TTP have brought over weapons that the US left behind, including M-16s and sniper rifles with night-vision thermal goggles, the people said. Hundreds of TTP fighters released from a Kabul prison by the Taliban after the group retook power also returned to fight in Pakistan, they added.\n\n>Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, a spokeswoman for Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry, declined to comment. Inter-Services Public Relations, the military\u2019s media wing, didn\u2019t answer calls or respond to texts seeking comment.\n\n>Taliban spokesmen Zabihullah Mujahed and Bilal Karimi didn\u2019t answer calls or respond to WhatsApp messages seeking comment. In a statement in February, the TTP said it waged a \u201csacred war\u201d against Pakistan\u2019s army and called on politicians and others not to become an obstacle in this war.\n\n>At meetings in Islamabad in May involving Pakistan, China and the Taliban, Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the TTP and Pakistan should hold talks, but he didn\u2019t suggest a role for the Taliban. Meanwhile, the Taliban agreed with China and Pakistan to extend the Belt and Road Initiative to Afghanistan.\n\n>The US withdrawal \u201cgave impetus to TTP activities,\u201d Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, a spokesman for Pakistan\u2019s army, said in a press conference on April 25. Some 239 people, including 137 army officers and soldiers, have been killed in hundreds of insurgent attacks this year, he said.\n\n>On their side, the Taliban are upset that Pakistan hasn\u2019t recognized their regime, people familiar with the matter said. But doing so would be difficult for Pakistan given the sanctions on the Taliban and Islamabad\u2019s need for the International Monetary Fund to approve a stalled bailout package.\n\n>**Pakistan is designated a major non-NATO ally by the US.** While that confers some military and financial advantages, it includes no mutual defense treaty that would obligate American forces to respond in the event of a military attack. Some US lawmakers over the years have sought to remove the status due in part to Pakistani support for the Taliban.\n\n>During the war on terror, Pakistan covertly helped the militant group in their attempts to overthrow a US-backed Afghan government that was friendlier with India, and provided refuge and medical assistance to Taliban leaders and fighters, said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, a think tank.\n\n>The TTP is the largest and deadliest of about a dozen insurgent groups in Pakistan, with thousands of fighters hailing from the tribal belt. \n\n>The group announced its existence in 2007 after Pakistani security forces launched an operation against a prominent mosque in Islamabad that was suspected of sheltering and training Islamic radicals. More than 100 people died in the violence. \n\n>The TTP\u2019s attacks are increasing just as Pakistan faces several other major issues. Political tensions are at breaking point. More than 10,000 people linked to Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party were arrested in police raids following protests after Khan was arrested in May. Khan and his wife have been placed on a no-fly list. Inflation is accelerating at the fastest pace in Asia, making it difficult for many of the country\u2019s more than 220 million people to pay for fuel and food. And negotiations with the IMF are at a critical stage as the international lender has yet to release the funds. \n\n>All things considered, the now-retired ISI chief\u2019s confidence in Kabul\u2019s Serena Hotel is looking ill-advised.\n\n>\u201cPakistan had long banked on the Taliban being its best strategic bet in Afghanistan - a group willing to help Pakistan pursue its interests, including counterterrorism,\u201d Kugelman said. \u201cWhat Pakistan apparently didn\u2019t realize was that the Taliban, once it no longer needed a wartime sanctuary in Pakistan, would assert its independence from its former patron and refuse to do its bidding.\u201d",

Even in Korea, where the troop density could potentially be extremely high, it you can\u2019t every hold a piece of ground against a determined assault. So aside from the approaches to major cities like Sumy and Kharkov, which would have to be held early, the UA would have to conduct a flexible and forward defense. It leads to a paradox, politics dictates a defense close to the border while a militarily sound defense would emphasize delay, mobilization, and counter attack. What they need is an Israeli model, tho on a much larger scale. \n\nUkraine needs a large Army to challenge a Russian invasion, lots of soldiers, tons of equipment, and large ammo reserves. Likely Ukraine would have to main a sizable active force along the Dnepr zone, both east (to fight the first battle) and west (to reinforce the first force and hold penetrations east of the river). Then in the far east along the NATO border, reservists would meet reserve stocks and then head East. Aircraft would be dispersed during a crisis to alternate fields and prebuilt hardened shelters. Naval assets, such as UUVs would also deploy to secure the maritime border, EG Odessa. The battle in the East would likely have two purposes, like I said. To first push Russian troops away from the major eastern cities and second to canalize their attack into thin strikes. Then once the first round of mobilization (24-48hrs, mostly former active soldiers) completes, the UA counter attacks the stalled penetrations and restores the border. Of course the UA also has to avoid the error made in \u201873, when the Israelis in the Sinai followed this script despite the Egyptians clearly deviating from their prewar plan. Flexibility and a willingness to tolerate weeks/months of occupation are vital. \n\nThe Ukrainian border is simply too long to be fortified significantly, outside of the main highways between Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkov, etc. and the border. They also have to assume that any major prewar assets will be targeted, and stuff which is permanently stationed east of the Dnepr may become significantly degraded at least temporarily as a result. Even if Ukraine gets a great western AD net, a halfway competent Ru SEAD op would force them to go dark and move (the S in SEAD) leaving the front temporarily vulnerable. The keys are to be dispersed and flexible everywhere that the Ukrainians can. Don\u2019t maintain large garrisons, don\u2019t expect to win far forward, be prepared to wait 48 or more hours to launch the big counter attack. Only fight where retreat is absolutely politically unacceptable. Places where it may be more palatable to lose the bulk of the initial force than to give the place up. \n\nThe Bar Lev fortifications made the mistake of trying to hold strongpoints up front, those forts turned into tombs and drove the Israelis into suicidal counterattacks to futilely free isolated garrisons. Ukraine can\u2019t do that. Even in the Golan, where thick fortifications existed and *worked* the Syrians broke through the southern sector and was hours away from capturing major bridges over the Jordan. The crisis was adverted when a division, held in reserve facing Lebanon and not fully manned, was quickly mobilized and turned eastward. The counterattack and northern pressure southward into the canalized penetration turned a near disaster into a crushing victory. That and the massive, appalling, losses the Syrians took in their initial early afternoon attack.",

To first push Russian troops away from the major eastern cities and second to canalize their attack into thin strikes. Then once the first round of mobilization (24-48hrs, mostly former active soldiers) completes, the UA counter attacks the stalled penetrations and restores the border. Of course the UA also has to avoid the error made in \u201873, when the Israelis in the Sinai followed this script despite the Egyptians clearly deviating from their prewar plan. Flexibility and a willingness to tolerate weeks/months of occupation are vital. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian border is simply too long to be fortified significantly, outside of the main highways between Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkov, etc. and the border. They also have to assume that any major prewar assets will be targeted, and stuff which is permanently stationed east of the Dnepr may become significantly degraded at least temporarily as a result. Even if Ukraine gets a great western AD net, a halfway competent Ru SEAD op would force them to go dark and move (the S in SEAD) leaving the front temporarily vulnerable. The keys are to be dispersed and flexible everywhere that the Ukrainians can. Don\u2019t maintain large garrisons, don\u2019t expect to win far forward, be prepared to wait 48 or more hours to launch the big counter attack. Only fight where retreat is absolutely politically unacceptable. Places where it may be more palatable to lose the bulk of the initial force than to give the place up. </p>\n\n<p>The Bar Lev fortifications made the mistake of trying to hold strongpoints up front, those forts turned into tombs and drove the Israelis into suicidal counterattacks to futilely free isolated garrisons. Ukraine can\u2019t do that. Even in the Golan, where thick fortifications existed and <em>worked</em> the Syrians broke through the southern sector and was hours away from capturing major bridges over the Jordan. The crisis was adverted when a division, held in reserve facing Lebanon and not fully manned, was quickly mobilized and turned eastward. The counterattack and northern pressure southward into the canalized penetration turned a near disaster into a crushing victory. That and the massive, appalling, losses the Syrians took in their initial early afternoon attack.</p>\n</div>",

Both Ukraine and MENA saw populist revolutions with relatively limited military engagement. Aside from Tunisia, most of the Arab spring revolutions simply saw a different corrupt authoritarian government put into power. We had no way of knowing that kicking out Yanukovych would lead to the current system in Ukraine, or that annexing Crimea was the foreshadowing to the largest post-WWII war in europe's history. Additionally, during the Arab spring the EU perceived it as a minor issue taking place on its periphery, a view which I think colored the popular image of Ukraine even as NATO countries stepped into improve training between 2014 and February 2022.\n\nThis isn't an excuse. We should have done more, and we should have done it a lot earlier. As an American, it still embarrasses me to know we had a sitting President try to run a protection racket on the Ukrainians for dirt on a political opponent. I hope this awful war maybe reshapes how we see other aspiring colonial despots, and what their ambitions could mean for world stability. I'm just trying to figure out how we overlooked the chance for the catastrophe we're dealing with right now.",

Additionally, during the Arab spring the EU perceived it as a minor issue taking place on its periphery, a view which I think colored the popular image of Ukraine even as NATO countries stepped into improve training between 2014 and February 2022.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t an excuse. We should have done more, and we should have done it a lot earlier. As an American, it still embarrasses me to know we had a sitting President try to run a protection racket on the Ukrainians for dirt on a political opponent. I hope this awful war maybe reshapes how we see other aspiring colonial despots, and what their ambitions could mean for world stability. I&#39;m just trying to figure out how we overlooked the chance for the catastrophe we&#39;re dealing with right now.</p>\n</div>",

Said Hamilton: \u201cWe were training it in simulation to identify and target a SAM threat. And then the operator would say yes, kill that threat. The system started realising that while they did identify the threat at times the human operator would tell it not to kill that threat, but it got its points by killing that threat. So what did it do? It killed the operator. It killed the operator because that person was keeping it from accomplishing its objective.\u201d  \nHe went on: \u201cWe trained the system \u2013 \u2018Hey don\u2019t kill the operator \u2013 that\u2019s bad.
