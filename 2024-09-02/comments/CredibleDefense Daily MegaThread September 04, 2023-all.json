The link to the [War on the Rocks article](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/perseverance-and-adaptation-ukraines-counteroffensive-at-three-months/) in question. Many interesting points and observations raised throughout the article, so I'll just limit myself to pasting the first six introductory paragraphs that I believe set the tone well:\n\n>On June 4, Ukraine launched its long-awaited offensive. The operation has proven to be a test of Ukrainian determination and adaptation. Despite stiff resistance, Ukrainian forces have made steady gains in a set-piece battle against a heavily entrenched force. Ukraine\u2019s main effort is a push from Orikhiv, with the goal of driving south past Tokmak and ideally reaching Melitopol. If successful, this would sever Russian lines along the Black Sea coast and endanger supply routes from Crimea. The second is at Velika Novosilka, a secondary offensive operation likely aimed at Berdyansk, also along the coast. The third is a supporting offensive along the flanks of Bakhmut further to the north. Ukraine has made gains here, pinning several Russian airborne units. The offensive is gaining momentum, and much remains undecided, but three months in offers an opportunity to take stock of the operation thus far.  \n>  \n>This has become a war of tree lines, with shifts in the line often counted in hundreds of meters. Artillery fire and drones dominate the battlefield, as small groups of infantry advance through dense minefields, field by field, tree line by tree line. Progress has been fitful and slower than expected, as acknowledged by President Volodymyr Zelensky and now former Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov. However, Ukraine\u2019s recent gains illustrate that it has worn down Russian defenses over time, leveraging an advantage in fires and long-range precision weapons to steadily press Russian forces back from their defensive positions. That said, Ukraine will need to both break through Russian lines and exploit that success to reach its objectives. Much could be decided in the coming weeks.  \n>  \n>As we and others predicted, this kind of operation was bound to be difficult and costly. Without air superiority, a decisive advantage in fires, and limited enablers to breach Russian lines, any military would have faced similar struggles in such an operation. This is especially so against a force that had time to entrench, preparing a layered defense replete with minefields and fortifications. Ukraine\u2019s military changed tactics, from initially trying to breach Russian lines in a mechanized assault to taking a more familiar attritional approach that achieved incremental gains. Over time this approach can work, and has worked for the Ukrainian armed forces in the past, but each battle has its own context with a different set of conditions, geography, and forces in play.  \n>  \n>Ukraine needs more air defense, mine clearing, and similar enabling capabilities. Western assistance over the past 18 months has enabled Ukraine, but it has also limited Ukraine\u2019s options, resulting in undertrained units having to go up against a well-prepared defense without the benefit of air support. However, the challenges of this are not only due to capability and capacity shortcomings. The Ukrainian military continues to struggle with scaling offensive operations, and conducting combined arms operations at the battalion level and above, with most attacks being at the level of a platoon or company. These are important areas to address in Western training programs, as we have discussed with our colleagues in various episodes of the War on the Rocks podcast and the Russia Contingency.  \n>  \n>There is no single answer to the challenges Ukraine faces. The problem cannot be reduced to a lack of Western tactical aviation. The more important factors remain ammunition, training, providing the necessary enablers, and effective resource management in a war of attrition. War requires regular adaptation, since few plans survive contact with the enemy, but the process of adaptation equally requires identifying what has worked and what has not. The ability to discuss these challenges openly (which, in our view, doesn\u2019t include leaks to newspapers from behind a veil of anonymity) is what separates successful militaries from those like Russia\u2019s, which often falsifies success and buries bad news. Indeed, a poor understanding of how Ukraine\u2019s military fights, and of the operating environment writ large, may be leading to false expectations, misplaced advice, and unfair criticism in Western official circles.  \n>  \n>Ukraine\u2019s summer offensive is coming down to the balance of attrition over time, which side has more reserves, and who can better manage their combat power in a prolonged slugfest. In order to sustain Ukraine\u2019s war effort, Washington should support Kyiv\u2019s preferred approach, which means resourcing ammunition for an intensive fight, providing the requisite long-range strike systems, and supporting enablers. However, it should also learn from this experience, tackling long-term issues such as training, helping Ukraine improve its ability to conduct operations at scale, and transitioning to employ Western airpower along with the associated organizational changes to make it effective. It is also critical for Western countries to draw the right lessons from the development and performance of Ukraine\u2019s new brigades to improve future training efforts. The details in discussed in this article are based on open sources and our own field research in Ukraine, but do not disclose anything that is not publicly available about ongoing operations.",

However, the challenges of this are not only due to capability and capacity shortcomings. The Ukrainian military continues to struggle with scaling offensive operations, and conducting combined arms operations at the battalion level and above, with most attacks being at the level of a platoon or company. These are important areas to address in Western training programs, as we have discussed with our colleagues in various episodes of the War on the Rocks podcast and the Russia Contingency.  </p>\n\n<p>There is no single answer to the challenges Ukraine faces. The problem cannot be reduced to a lack of Western tactical aviation. The more important factors remain ammunition, training, providing the necessary enablers, and effective resource management in a war of attrition. War requires regular adaptation, since few plans survive contact with the enemy, but the process of adaptation equally requires identifying what has worked and what has not. The ability to discuss these challenges openly (which, in our view, doesn\u2019t include leaks to newspapers from behind a veil of anonymity) is what separates successful militaries from those like Russia\u2019s, which often falsifies success and buries bad news. Indeed, a poor understanding of how Ukraine\u2019s military fights, and of the operating environment writ large, may be leading to false expectations, misplaced advice, and unfair criticism in Western official circles.  </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s summer offensive is coming down to the balance of attrition over time, which side has more reserves, and who can better manage their combat power in a prolonged slugfest. In order to sustain Ukraine\u2019s war effort, Washington should support Kyiv\u2019s preferred approach, which means resourcing ammunition for an intensive fight, providing the requisite long-range strike systems, and supporting enablers. However, it should also learn from this experience, tackling long-term issues such as training, helping Ukraine improve its ability to conduct operations at scale, and transitioning to employ Western airpower along with the associated organizational changes to make it effective. It is also critical for Western countries to draw the right lessons from the development and performance of Ukraine\u2019s new brigades to improve future training efforts. The details in discussed in this article are based on open sources and our own field research in Ukraine, but do not disclose anything that is not publicly available about ongoing operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Putin to discuss the possibility of supplying Russia with more weaponry for its war in Ukraine and other military cooperation, according to American and allied officials.\n\n>In a rare foray from his country, Mr. Kim would travel from Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital, probably by armored train, to Vladivostok, on the Pacific Coast of Russia, where he would meet with Mr. Putin, the officials said. Mr. Kim could possibly go to Moscow, though that is not certain.\n\n>Mr. Putin wants Mr. Kim to agree to send Russia artillery shells and antitank missiles, and Mr. Kim would like Russia to provide North Korea with advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines, the officials said. Mr. Kim is also seeking food aid for his impoverished nation.\n\n>Both leaders would be on the campus of Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok to attend the Eastern Economic Forum, which is scheduled to run Sept. 10 to 13, according to the officials. Mr. Kim also plans to visit Pier 33, where naval ships from Russia\u2019s Pacific fleet dock, they said. North Korea celebrates the anniversary of its founding on Sept. 9.\n\n>On Wednesday, the White House warned that Mr. Putin and Mr. Kim had exchanged letters discussing a possible arms deal, citing declassified intelligence. A White House spokesman, John F. Kirby, said high-level talks on military cooperation between the two nations were \u201cactively advancing.\u201d U.S. officials declined to give more details on the state of personal ties between the leaders, who are considered adversaries of the United States.\n\n>The new information about a planned meeting between them goes far beyond the previous warning. The intelligence relating to the plans has not been declassified or downgraded by the United States, and the officials describing it were not authorized to discuss it. They declined to provide details on how spy agencies had collected the information.\n\n>While the White House declined to discuss the new intelligence, Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement that Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, traveled to North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to try to persuade Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunition to Russia.\n\n>\u201cAs we have warned publicly, arms negotiations between Russia and the DPRK are actively advancing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have information that Kim Jong-un expects these discussions to continue, possibly to include high level diplomatic engagement in Russia.\u201d\n\n>At other times since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, U.S. officials have released declassified intelligence to try to dissuade North Korea, China and other countries from supplying Russia with weapons. U.S. officials say White House warnings about planned transfers of North Korean artillery shells stopped previous cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow.\n\n>In late August, a delegation of about 20 North Korean officials, including some who oversee security protocols for the leadership, traveled by train from Pyongyang to Vladivostok, and then flew to Moscow, an indication that North Korea was serious about a visit by Mr. Kim. Their trip, believed to be a planning expedition, took about 10 days, according to officials briefed on the intelligence reports.\n\n>One potential stop for Mr. Kim after Vladivostok, an official said, is Vostochny Cosmodrome, a space launch center that was the site of a meeting in April 2022 between Mr. Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a partner of Mr. Putin\u2019s in the war in Ukraine. The center, whose first rocket launch took place in 2016, is about 950 miles north of Vladivostok.\n\n>The idea for the Russia visit came out of the trip by Mr. Shoigu to North Korea in July for Mr. Kim\u2019s celebration of the 70th anniversary of the \u201cvictory\u201d over South Korean and U.S. forces in the Korean War, officials said. (In reality, the three-year war halted in 1953 in a stalemate and armistice agreement, and the two Koreas are still officially at war.)\n\n>Mr. Kim took Mr. Shoigu to an exhibition of weaponry and military equipment that included ballistic missiles banned by the United Nations.\n\n>During the meeting, Mr. Kim presented Mr. Shoigu with options for greater military cooperation and asked for Mr. Putin to visit North Korea, officials said. Mr. Shoigu then made a counterproposal, suggesting that Mr. Kim travel to Russia.\n\n>Mr. Shoigu\u2019s visit to North Korea was the first by a Russian defense minister since the fracturing of the Soviet Union in 1991. Mr. Shoigu presented Mr. Kim with a letter from Mr. Putin, according to the Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, the country\u2019s state news service.\n\n>The agency did not indicate that Mr. Kim had explicitly mentioned Ukraine in the conversations, but it said that he had \u201cexpressed his views on the issues of mutual concern in the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty, development and interests of the two countries from the highhanded and arbitrary practices of the imperialists and to realize international justice and peace.\u201d\n\n>Mr. Putin has characterized his war against Ukraine as one of protecting Russian sovereignty, since in his view Ukraine should be part of a restored Russian Empire.\n\n>In June, Mr. Kim sent Mr. Putin a message on Russia\u2019s national day in which he pledged to \u201chold hands\u201d with the Russian leader and promised that the Russian people would have North Korea\u2019s \u201cfull support and solidarity\u201d for their \u201call-out struggle,\u201d according to the KCNA.\n\n>\u201cThe strengthening of the Russia-North Korea alliance comes at an opportune time for two countries with very few allies and a shared adversary in the United States,\u201d said Jean H.

He and President Donald J. Trump exchanged a series of letters as they prepared for historic face-to-face summits.\nFor the second of those summits, held in February 2019 in Hanoi, Vietnam, Mr. Kim traveled by armored train for two days from Pyongyang through China and across its tropical border with Vietnam. Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, both preferred to travel by train outside the country.\n\n>Mr. Kim first visited Russia in 2019, when he arrived in Vladivostok on his armored green train to meet with Mr. Putin. As the train pulled slowly into the station, white-gloved North Korean attendants raced alongside it, frantically wiping down any handholds and other surfaces that Mr. Kim might touch as he disembarked.\n\n>A beaming Mr. Kim stepped off in a black fedora and long black coat.

Officials, citing declassified U.S. intelligence, said that Russia planned to buy artillery shells for use in Ukraine.\n\n>In subsequent disclosures, Mr. Kirby said North Korea had shipped munitions to Russia through the Middle East and North Africa.\nBut U.S. officials said that the disclosures had deterred North Korea and that few if any North Korean weapons had made it to the front lines in Ukraine.\n\n>Deterring support for Russia from North Korea, Iran and China is a critical element of the Biden administration\u2019s strategy for helping Ukraine in its defense against Russia.\n\n>China, warned by Secretary of State Antony J.

There are other significant metrics that aren't as flashy, like what percentage of a batch of chips actually works that no company is very open with.\n\nSMIC retracting their 14nm claims would suggest that their yields were too low to bother with the production line.

Furthermore, decisions pertaining to ruses and deception are generally very context-specific, and there are subtle differences in how they apply on land, in air and at sea.\n\nYou may find some relevant information and starting points to answer your question in 5.21-5.25 [here](https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf?ver=2016-12-13-172036-190),  [here](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1572&context=ils) or possibly [here](https://www.icrc.org/data/rx/en/assets/files/other/irrc_853_pfanner.pdf) and [here](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/military-markings-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/).\n\nYou don't need to encode emblems or anything specific for some types of IFF spoofing to fall under provisions of the Geneva convention. Using a civilian squawk code, for example, quite clearly falls under [Article 37](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-37) as it invites an adversary to believe he is obliged to accord protection under the rules of international law.\n\nHowever, other types of IFF spoofing *may* fall under legal protection afforded to military rues by Art. 37, paragraph 2. For example, in their commentary to the protocols additional to the Geneva Bothe, Partsch & Solf argue that only concrete visual symbols fall under the provisions of Art. 39, and that spoofing military status or orders falls under the protection afforded for the use of enemy codes, passwords and countersigns. \n\nThe reasoning behind it is that there is a reasonable expectation that an army would try to safeguard its codes, passwords and countersigns. Failure to do so is a failure of a military nature. Any deception based on it would be based on an operational failure, not on misleading the enemy about the protection it is owed or forced to apply, or on an expressed or implied agreement requiring truth from the combatants, so the exploitation of such a failure would be fair game. IMHO (this is where my sources end and my speculation begins, so take it with an even bigger grain of salt than the rest) the *content* of the electronic signaling isn't relevant in this case.\n\n*Even then,* though, the answer is still context- and content-dependent. See for example [this old document](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AFP-110-31-US-AIr-Force-INTERNATIONAL-LAW-THE-CONDUCT-OF-ARMED-CONFLICT-AND-AIR-OPERATIONS-just-security.pdf) discussing the use of flares (the subject itself isn't relevant here but the way it's examined is). Using flares to deceive an enemy aircraft into landing in a treacherous place is lawful only as long as it is impossible for civilian aircrafts to be misled into landing there. Similarly, feigning IFF signatures in a way that e.g. invites emergency team responses may be considered unlawful (and in particular feigning a distress status would be considered perfidy under any circumstances).",

They unilaterally undertook the biggest annexation on European soil since World War 2 just under a year ago - annexing 4 different oblasts in their full territorial extent, of which they only had full control of one (Luhansk), but a large part of another one (Kherson) was even back then obviously going to be liberated hence their rush back then. The Constitution of Russia, as it currently stands, claims Russian ownership of 6th (5th if we exclude Donetsk) largest City in Ukraine (Zaporizhzhia) and an administrative capital of a whole oblast (Kherson + provisional capital of Donetsk, Kramatorsk). Just accepting realities on the ground as a starting point for negotiations would require a constitutional change in Russia (not literally, but you get the point) and a pretty sizeable reckoning within their society. I don't think we need much more evidence that Russia is not in any mood (or to be completely honest, position) to start negotiating in anything resembling good faith any time soon, even leaving aside the extent of callousness with which they've been breaking a lot of their previous treaties. I think we'll be noticing a rather long period of propaganda prep work before they even dare to embark down this path. Putin (Master Procrastinator as Kofman loves to call him) is obviously very reluctant to involve the broader population in a trip \"up\" the \"escalatory\" ladder, but I genuinely don't believe he feels much safer taking them down one, either.",

Just accepting realities on the ground as a starting point for negotiations would require a constitutional change in Russia (not literally, but you get the point) and a pretty sizeable reckoning within their society. I don&#39;t think we need much more evidence that Russia is not in any mood (or to be completely honest, position) to start negotiating in anything resembling good faith any time soon, even leaving aside the extent of callousness with which they&#39;ve been breaking a lot of their previous treaties. I think we&#39;ll be noticing a rather long period of propaganda prep work before they even dare to embark down this path. Putin (Master Procrastinator as Kofman loves to call him) is obviously very reluctant to involve the broader population in a trip &quot;up&quot; the &quot;escalatory&quot; ladder, but I genuinely don&#39;t believe he feels much safer taking them down one, either.</p>\n</div>",
