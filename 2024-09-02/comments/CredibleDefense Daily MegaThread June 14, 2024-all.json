He also said North Korea has sent dozens of ballistic missiles to help Putin\u2019s attack on his neighbor. \n\n>In return for the munitions, Russia has sent to North Korea technology to help in its plans to deploy an array of spy satellites as well as conventional arms such as tanks and aircraft.\n\n>Putin is set to visit North Korea as early as next week, the DongA Ilbo newspaper of South Korea has reported. The trip would be his first there since July 2000 and it\u2019s set to stoke concerns from the U.S. and its partners of arms transfers that have helped the Kremlin in its assault on Ukraine in exchange for aid propping up Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime.\n\n>With Kyiv now taking delivery of billions of dollars in fresh arms from its U.S. and European partners, the window for a Russian breakthrough is narrowing even as it continues to fire missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities including energy infrastructure.\n\n>The munitions sent by North Korea since Putin and Kim met in Russia in September for a meeting that led to stepped up trade between the neighbors have likely far outstripped what has been sent by the U.S. and the European Union. It has allowed the Kremlin\u2019s forces to bombard Ukraine, as it was forced to ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies \u2014 with aid being held up in the U.S. Congress.\n\n>While Ukrainian officials raised the alarm about the threat of a Russian breakthrough during months of delays over U.S. arms deliveries, Kyiv\u2019s troops mostly held the line despite being outgunned as much as 10-1 by Moscow\u2019s invading army. The European Union has pledged to send Ukraine one million artillery shells by the end of the year.\n\n>Kim, meanwhile, has been spending heavily on his missile program. Missile tests last year cost about $1 billion according to Shin. The figure represents about 4% of North Korea\u2019s economy, which South Korea\u2019s central bank estimated to be about $24.5 billion in 2022.\n\n>\u201cNorth Korea is ignoring its people\u2019s hardships to carry out missile provocations,\u201d Shin said. \u201cThe money is enough to cover North Korea\u2019s food shortages for a year.\u201d\n\n>A retired three-star Army general, Shin was a lawmaker of the ruling People Power Party until he assumed the ministerial job in October. He has been one of the most outspoken South Korean officials on North Korea\u2019s cooperation with Russia and the threats it poses to the global security.\n\n>Satellite imagery indicates that Pyongyang is making preparations for a Putin visit, the Seoul-based specialist service 38 North reported. Images show construction in Kim Il Sung Square in central Pyongyang indicative of the preparation for a military parade and planes parked at Pyongyang\u2019s main airport have been moved at the tarmac, likely to ready the facility for Putin, it reported Tuesday.\n\n>While Russia and North Korea have denied the arms transfers, commercial satellite imagery and intelligence provided by the U.S. government shows Russian cargo ships regularly shuttling between the once sleepy North Korean port of Najin near the border of Russia. Most have been bound for Dunay, a former Soviet submarine base about 180 kilometers (110 miles) away.\n\n>The White House has provided imagery it said showed weapons being sent on the route and delivered by rail thousands of miles away to a depot in the Russian town of Tikhoretsk for use in Ukraine.\n\nLooks like a good deal for both, I fully expect even more North Korean artillery will flow into Russia in 2024.",

(They already do this in numerous other economic sectors such as agriculture)\n\nUnlike China which their economy is still heavily intertwined with the West, North Korea doesn't have any incentive to play ball with the West, and thus is much more likely to give more support to Russia, for a price.  \nBUT for Russia, that price is probably, actually extremely cheap for artillery rounds. Russia probably just has to hand over some missile and plane technologies that they already developed a decade ago, and with some reports even suggesting Russia was buying artillery rounds for literally FOOD supplies to North Korea, it seems Russia could if North Korea wants too, turn the country in a major Russian source of artillery for pennies on the dollar.",

The US military may believe it is fighting fire with fire because of roughly comparable Chinese disinformation campaigns in Southeast Asia, but adding further disinformation to the media environment undermines the fundamental mechanisms of democracy. A well-functioning democracy requires well-informed voters, and adding more disinformation to the mix only creates even less well-informed voters.

Authoritarian regimes enjoy a differential advantage over open societies in disinformation warfare because they strictly control information internally to limit dissent and necessarily develop robust propaganda machines capable of generating effective foreign disinformation campaigns because they get so much practice doing so domestically.

For the most part, you were either sympathetic to the Soviets, to the US, or were largely out of the loop. There was no global media and a vast majority of the world population had little access to news outside their region, let alone their country. The US was either an \"evil imperialist\" or the \"defender of freedom\" for most people. This was a battle of images in which the US was perfectly at home, given the \"City on a Hill\" narrative dating back to the founding of the Massachusetts Bay colony. Inside the US, this idealism only grew through WW2 and up to the late 60s. This worldview took a beating domestically from 1968 through the 1970s, but internationally the US could still promote a fairly straightforward narrative during the Cold War.\n\nDuring and after the collapse of the USSR, he US needed to find its ideological footing. With the loss of global Communism, the US could no longer capitalize on anti-Communism to fuel its international image. The US \"defender of freedom\" Cold War narrative stemmed predominantly from anti-Communism, not the concept of universal human rights. Dealing with the chaos of the USSR's collapse led to Operation Desert Storm and the interventions in the Yugoslav wars, which gradually yielded the modern \"good guys\" narrative familiar to most these days. I don't believe there was any kind of coordinated plan to shift to emphasizing universal human rights during the \"End of History\" period. Rather, it developed organically from containment of global instability resulting from the collapse of the bipolar world system; the Christian humanism foundations of liberalism (the wide-ranging liberalism of John Locke, not the narrow definition of US domestic politics); and an urgent need for the US to both establish a new ideological foundation for its hegemony in the absence of global Communism as well as rediscover a moral foundation after forty years of anti-Communism.\n\nThat last part is crucial: during the Cold War, the US were the \"good guys\" because it was the bulwark against the \"tyranny of global Communism\". This was a very straightforward narrative; the appeal of the US was its opposition to Marxist-Leninist, USSR-aligned authoritarian states. There are, of course, additional components, namely the capitalist appeals of prosperity and opportunity, but the core messaging was simple: the US will either directly fight or back those who fight the people who want to establish these ML regimes. Part-im-parcel with this dynamic was the reality that imposing Communism came with much more baggage than just an authoritarian government; quite often it also involved anti-religious and ideological campaigns (e.g. the [Taraki regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_Muhammad_Taraki) as an extreme example) and major socioeconomic reorganization (e.g. forced establishment of people's communes in rural China, the Cuban Revolutionary Offensive). Of course, the US often backed authoritarian regimes that were friendly to its interests, but these strongmen had the advantage of being able to balance lots of various ethnic, religious, and ideological groups (and play them against one another, an old British imperialist trick) while also galvanizing them against Communism. In short, the ambitious scope of the \"Communist project\" created a lot of local enemies who could be united to thwart Communist movements.\n\nNow, the narrative has shifted to the US being the \"good guys\" because it \"protects universal human rights\". Ironically, the dynamics of the modern \"universal human rights\" narrative mirrors those of the aforementioned \"Communist project\"; the narrative core has shifted from a simple proposition, anti-Communism, to a highly complex and ambitious one, global enforcement of \"human rights\". Setting aside the obvious question of who defines those and how they are defined, the US has set itself up to fail with the \"universal human rights\" narrative. \"Rights\" are fundamentally dependent on a legal system; a legal system is fundamentally dependent on a monopoly of the legitimate use of force; therefore, *universal* rights are fundamentally dependent on a *universal* monopoly of the legitimate use of force. I don't think I need to elaborate on the implications of this. This brings us to the incoherence of the \"rules based international order\" under the US. This order is fundamentally predicated on the martial and economic (hard) power of the United States. Operating under the assumption that the best interests of the United States are *not* universal, placing the interests of another state above those of the US when they do not align necessarily comprimises the hard power of the US. This necessarily comprimises the foundation of power on which the \"rules based international order\" is predicated. I would consider this the \"realist\" component of my perspective.\n\nI'm not a fan of a purely realist perspective in these matters so I'm not advocating a strictly zero-sum view of world affairs. I believe that it's possible for the US to put the interests of another state above its own without comprimising its hard power *in the long term*. Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan come to mind as two obvious examples. However, as you might have already intuited, there still needs to be some kind of \"payoff\" for the US in the long-term. This payoff could be either \"soft\" or \"hard\": a soft power payoff would produce a greater degree of institutional and/or popular trust between the US and the other state. This \"greases the wheels\" of politics between the two (and the domestic politics of each state when it comes to interacting with the other) and also provides opportunities for developing the processes and organizations necessary for inter-state cooperation. However, this \"payoff\" is the riskier of the two because it is largely immaterial; attitudes can change overnight and we cannot quantify these gains like we can quantify currencies, resources, and materiel. A hard power payoff should be fairly obvious in light of this; giving the USSR materiel during WW2 directly contributed to the destruction of materiel of a common enemy that was judged to be a greater threat. The parts of the Marshall Plan that were not just donations (e.g. debt that accrued interest) were an investment on the part of the US that provided fixed returns. In the context of a military, political, or economic block, these same payoffs can apply collectively between all members and an outside state/bloc, or bilaterally between individual members of the bloc. To avoid getting to Structuralist about this, groupings like this can also overlap and/or only involve parts of the private and/or public sector of any given country, and the \"exchange\" need not be in the same realm (i.e. political/military, economic/military, economic/political). The elements of this that are not purely transactional constitute the \"idealist\" component of my perspective, but it is enhanced by transaction because even smooth transactions still produce intangible goods like trust and goodwill.\n\nThis perspective is permissive enough to account for the relationship between the US and the rest of the \"Global North\", but there are two core issues: the scope of this quasi-legal system and its fundamental dependence on the US as a foundation. The more countries one tries to cover under this system, the more difficult it is to maintain the coherence of the idealistic intereactions due to the exponentially increasing complexity of the totality of international interactions involved, the increasing diversity of thought, culture, and ideology producing fundamental disagreements that prevent a broad consensus, and the inevitable overlap of exceptionally difficult bilateral relations (Pakistan-India, Greece-Turkey, Israel-Iran as the most extreme examples). This scope problem comprimises both the \"idealist\" dynamics described above and the ability for a subset of the countries in this system to execute legal enforcement via coersion. This leads to the second core issue: forming the foundation of this system on American power places the US in a contradiction. The US cannot rely solely on the global exercise of unilateral hard power (the pure \"realist\" component) to enforce this global legal system because that would necessitate a *universal monopoly of power*, a world police in the most literal sense. To make up for this inability, the US needs to rely on the \"idealist\" component. However, this component still requires the US to sufficiently prioritize its own interests to ensure that it can act as the foundation of the system. The US is the foundation in two \"realist\" ways: its power creates a \"center of gravity\" around which other nations align and the US acts as the *capo dei capi* to settle disputes when necessary and preserve the system. In the \"idealist\" sense, the US provides a prototypal political and economic worldview that either aligns or shapes those of other nations in the system, thus facilitating further political, economy, military, and popular exchange between the members of this system.",

                                "body": "However, the US' role as the foundation is also a contradictory one. Since there is no global monopoly of power, there is no true universally applied legal system. The \"legal system\" of this patchwork system is only multilateral insofar as it is cooperative. When two member states of the system reach an irreconciable difference, one of two things happen: either they engage in conflict (not necessarily military) or another member (or members) intervene(s) to settle the matter. A conflict comprimises the entire system in the same way that a war between two Mexican cartels comprimises Mexico as a nation-state. Ultimately, there needs to be a *capo dei capi* to settle matters between the most powerful states in this system, especially because a war between the most powerful states is also the most damaging to the system. The US *de facto* serves this role right now, but this necessitates that it maintain a sufficient surplus of power to serve this role. Both this prioritization and the execution of this role also erode the aforementioned \"idealist\" component because unilateral action against the interests of another state is bound to upset other members, and prioritization of this surplus of power necessarily subordinates the interests of the other member states.\n\nIn short, since there is no global monopoly of power, any global system is necessarily dependent on both a cooperative system of international coordination and a \"final arbiter\" with a sufficient excess of power to enforce its will unilaterally. The role of the \"final arbiter\" necessarily involves a tradeoff between prioritizing the interests of said arbiter and the sufficient tabling of said (at cost to the \"final arbiter\") to maintain a cooperative system between an increasingly diverse group of member states.

                                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>However, the US&#39; role as the foundation is also a contradictory one. Since there is no global monopoly of power, there is no true universally applied legal system. The &quot;legal system&quot; of this patchwork system is only multilateral insofar as it is cooperative. When two member states of the system reach an irreconciable difference, one of two things happen: either they engage in conflict (not necessarily military) or another member (or members) intervene(s) to settle the matter. A conflict comprimises the entire system in the same way that a war between two Mexican cartels comprimises Mexico as a nation-state. Ultimately, there needs to be a <em>capo dei capi</em> to settle matters between the most powerful states in this system, especially because a war between the most powerful states is also the most damaging to the system. The US <em>de facto</em> serves this role right now, but this necessitates that it maintain a sufficient surplus of power to serve this role. Both this prioritization and the execution of this role also erode the aforementioned &quot;idealist&quot; component because unilateral action against the interests of another state is bound to upset other members, and prioritization of this surplus of power necessarily subordinates the interests of the other member states.</p>\n\n<p>In short, since there is no global monopoly of power, any global system is necessarily dependent on both a cooperative system of international coordination and a &quot;final arbiter&quot; with a sufficient excess of power to enforce its will unilaterally. The role of the &quot;final arbiter&quot; necessarily involves a tradeoff between prioritizing the interests of said arbiter and the sufficient tabling of said (at cost to the &quot;final arbiter&quot;) to maintain a cooperative system between an increasingly diverse group of member states. Any failures within this system that require unilateral action on the part of the &quot;final arbiter&quot; also erode the soft power underlying this system, which means that a cascade of failures could quickly bring the entire system to collapse. To bring this back to the original topic at hand: the US has traded a very simple system of international soft power for an immensely complex, fundamentally contradictory one.

Because if these groups would stop fighting each other they would be in a <em>lot</em> of trouble. Iraq in 2013 trouble. Niger already got bailed out by the French previously. That help isn\u2019t coming again.</p>\n</div>",

But they are organized and they DO have more power than an individual), and that stating \"Those who participated in 10/7 are connected to Palestinian civilians, therefore 10/7 was done by Palestinian civilians/ done with their support\" perpetuates the Israeli talking point that all Palestinians are combatants and that there are no innocent civilians? \n\nAnd finally, do you disagree with me as well and view that, depending on the end... It justifies the means, no questions asked? That all settlers are complicit, no matter their age, even if they are children, and deserve death, no questions asked? That Israeli Veterans who are murdered deserve it, no questions asked; devoid of context, devoid of the fact that many are forced into it, devoid of the fact that nurses would be considered veterans too and their deaths excused?\n\nI had tried to post this on geopolitics but wasn't able to.

Additionally, either them or someone in support, when I said \"Civilians were not responsible for 10/7\", stated that 10/7 was conducted by Palestinians and, therefore, since many have families and were at one point civilians... That those who launched, planned, and organized 10/7 were civilians (disregarding their role as a combatant on said day and completely disregarding the fact that 10/7 was planned by Hamas/a governmental body that represents only the Gaza Strip and not the West Bank too) ((i.e. Not all Palestinians))). (Disregarding the fact that there are many Palestinians against murdering civilians based ON PRINCIPLE). \n\nWhen I stated that this reinforces Israeli talking points where they state \"All Palestinians are responsible for 10/7\", \"Palestinians all support every action of Hamas\" and where they state \"All Palestinians civilians are complicit\", etc, I'm told that I'm spreading Hasbara talking points.With people completely disregarding the fact that someone had just said \"Murdering civilians is okay if the reason is justified\", \"Murdering illegal settlers is always justified\", and with the mods agreeing. Can we understand WHY they did this? Yes. Can we understand why oppressed people felt like they had no other choice? Yes. But does that mean we EXCUSE CIVILIAN death no matter the circumstance? Does that mean we instate a death penalty on every single settler? No matter the age? Even children? Because the mods on said sub would believe so as \"ALL SETTLERS ARE COMPLICIT\".

When that, additionally, wasn't the case. There were victims who WEREN'T settlers. There were victims who WEREN'T Israeli veterans.

That Israel has acted monstrously. That ISRAEL is the one at fault, ultimately**. But because I stated that Hamas, who PLANNED 10/7 (meaning it wasn't a  spontaneous action against oppression), could have targeted centers that affect Israeli politicians and military institutions. Would it have been harder? Yes. Does that mean they shouldn't do it? No! I'm dang sure Israel believes it's HARDER to only target Hamas/Combatants, which is WHY they say ALL Palestinians are complicit/combatants in some form. But me going AGAINST the Israeli government's ACTIONS and WAY OF THINKING, is spouting Hasbara talking points...? Where me saying that not all Palestinian civilians are tied to Hamas... is doing Israel's bidding? In what dang world?\n\nAll this is to say is: How is me saying murdering civilians is never okay/justified a Hasbara talking point?

And I posted this question in this mega thread rather than a post because it stated that the mega thread is the place to do so if you're unsure. Will take the question elsewhere I suppose, but I thought this was the appropriate place to do so, given the rules and context of the mega thread \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. It doesn't violate the rules but I can see how it COULD make people violate them. But, again, don't see how constructive conversation couldn't just... Be moderated? Instead of blocking it entirely?\n\nI believe there could be productive conversation as I have no idea how what I said was Hasbara talking points. That was my primary question and the rest were secondary. I'm sure I'm not the only one questioning why many on the site are excusing murdering civilians and when that became the norm in many circles. I have no doubt that there would be a few who aren't being productive. But I seriously doubt that my post absolutely WOULDN'T produce any productive conversation. It literally could.

Will take the question elsewhere I suppose, but I thought this was the appropriate place to do so, given the rules and context of the mega thread \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.

Secondly, some of the tech is out of date, there are newer materials that make things like stealth less costly to produce and maintain. \n\nOne caveat is apparently in the last or upcoming NDAA there seems to be some money set aside for the Raptor, but it likely has to do with upgrades.\n\n>was it shortsighted to discontinue the raptor if the NGAD will not be using any next-gen tech like directed energy weapons\n\nRaptor was discontinued because the Soviet Union fell and the GWOT took over the costs for all armed services, there simply was not a foe for it.\n\nI think you misunderstand the procurement process.  Let's say in 2000s as Raptor is entering service you start development of your next-gen fighter and you want the plane to come into service in the mid 2020s.  You set aside some money to do some studies and then top brass will set aside some \"ideas\" of what kind of tech they want in it and the capability guidelines the next fighter should have.  The movie Pentagon Wars is not very accurate but in a comedic way explains how design requirements can happen/change.\n\nOnce there is a general consensus about what those design requirements will be they submit solicitations to contractors like NG, LM, Boeing, etc for their design proposals (which comes with money to do this).  Part (or before) this process DARPA or similar defense agencies will provide insight into what deep research paths are available.\n\nLet's take your example of directed energy weapons, DARPA could say \"well we think this technology with the right funding may be ready in 10-20 years\", so this becomes a requirement for the contractor's design.  Next, the DOD will do a downselect between fewer and fewer contractors (lastly with prototypes) until they eventually award the contract to one of the companies.\n\nHowever, it is now 2010 and DARPA says \"I know we said 10-20 years, but it is definitely looking like another 10-15 years away still.\"  At this point the DOD, if it really wants directed energy weapons, will decide to delay the requirement or keep on track.  If the DOD says go ahead and remove DEW the contractor might come back and say \"with this change, it will still take another 10 years to switch based on the tooling we already designed and built.  Because during development they will be building aircraft to be testbeds for further refinement and training\n\nThen there is a setback when it is found a critical design flaw with the fuel reacting with the new carbon fiber tanks and will result in an eventual 5-year delay.  Eventually, by 2030 the first production plane will be produced with cost overruns, delays, and without DEW.\n\nIn the other timeline, DOD says they will delay the plane until DEW is ready.  So now it is 2030s and not only is the project still behind due to delays, but now airframes that were meant to be replaced in the 2020s are failing because of those delays and the DOD has to fund both the reproduction of old lines and fund the delayed and overbudget DEW fighter for 2035. \n\nOn top of that Oceania has now become a threat as a near-peer and the DOD realizes in 2025 the need for more aircraft but has nothing but old aircraft designs and behind schedule next gen fighters.\n\nThis is a timeline starting in the 2000s, what you are proposing is such a design starting in 2020s when they realized China's growing near-peer threat is going to cause issues without a Raptor replacement.  If the DOD opts for super advanced technology that won't be ready for years to come there will be a very large gap in capability.  The whole thing about airframes is not a joke, it is why we have to buy F15EXs and the ANG is also having issues with airframes because the USAF is keeping old ones in service longer.\n\nSo what NGAD was designed around roughly 2020 and said we need an aircraft IN SERVICE by 2030-2033, with that very fast development they can't wait for next-gen tech that isn't ready and cannot be relied upon to not delay the program.  \n\nWhat I think you are missing is just because they aren't using beyond the horizon technology the tech in an aircraft is somehow outdated.  One of the biggest things for NGAD over the F22 is a few key features.  More mature electronics/radar/data gathering/etc that was created by the F35 program, better-designed stealth features with more advanced computer modeling and materials, an upgraded engine tech that the F35 will be getting in an upgrade as well that allows for more fuel efficiency without sacrificing power (https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/xa100-ges-new-jet-engine-could-transform-us-air-force-forever-185908), and finally an internal bay designed for new weapons the USAF has been working on such as hypersonic weapons.  There are likely more, but that is a good list (loyal wingman/command and control).\n\n>but given the ever-reducing capabilities of the NGAD would it simply not be replaced by more F-35s considering it\u2019s already way ahead of its near peers?\n\nThe F-35 is an amazing plane despite its name of \"Fat Amy\", it isn't the most agile fighter, but few planes can beat a slick F-16 in dogfight and few planes can beat the F-35 over the horizon (if you hear about foreign nations beating it typically those scenarios are designed to be hard to test gaps in the aircraft but more so doctrine/training/battle plans).\n\nHowever, the F-35 does not have the same range, loiter time, internal bay size, speed, or stealth as the F-22 does, it is simply a smaller aircraft (you should check size comparisons) designed for different mission sets.  It is a cheap fighter (the F35A is cheaper than 4th/4.5 gen aircraft) meant for a wide variety of missions.  The F-22/NGAD has a focus on air dominance and its capabilities will reflect that.\n\nBoth the USAF and Navy's next-gen aircraft are expected to be larger, stealthier, and less maneuverable than the F22, but still be good.  With larger size, it can use bases further out than China could more reliably hit or it can reduce the workload on air tankers from closer bases.  I think it might actually be faster - but it won't ever be advertised as such.\n\nAnother big thing to remember is NGAD is desired to be like the B21 Raider program where it has a \"modular\" design of systems that aren't meant to build jack of all trades which was a disaster for the F35 program (JSF), but an example of we are going to use that XA100 GE engine, F35 hardware for electronics, and clean slate airframe.  Because they want this out the door quickly, the next NGAD is meant to be made concurrently with production NGAD, so if NGAD is ready by 2030, NNGAD will be ready by 2035, and NNNGAD will be 2040.  The idea (which I can't find ATM) was they wanted small batches of iteratively designed aircraft that can be built off the same factory evolving the same way aircraft do with block designs but will share commonality between close systems or having two companies alternating.  So if NGAD is built by LM and its factories, NNGAD would be built by Boeing, then NNNGAD would be back to LM.\n\nThey want to avoid lengthy procurement processes for technology to eventually and hopefully mature by the time they ask for it, and instead build fighters with the tech that is ready now and keeps quickly replacing them.\n\nA great example of this is SpaceX with their rockets and Starlink sats.  Anyways, good luck if you read all that but I hope it clears it up for you.",

However, it still carries a massive 150 kg warhead which is an extreme amount of extra mass to subsidize for such a high kinetic energy requirement task. It also doesn't have a reaction control system, and being dependant on fins for a high-altitude intercept is more than a little strange. The resulting system is 8x larger than THAAD, and seemingly much less capable in the anti-ballistic missile role.\n\nRidge thinks that the system is a victim of design by committee, in that he think the design had to have a backup role to engage aircraft. The reality is that the energy calculus required to intercept ballistic missiles requires trade-offs. I'd encourage everyone to in particular pay attention to post 14/23, which has some realistic looking interception envelopes for the 5V55R (S-300) missile.

Because versus the RSF, the non-Arab tribes basically face extinction in Sudan. It seems the RSF may really try to \"finish the job\" this time around.\n\nDarfur fell very quickly after the start of the war last April, due to two main factors- it's the RSF's homeland, and the government forces, anti-government forces, and locals were extremely unorganized thanks to the collapse in stability in Khartoum. I think that may be starting to change now that the Sudanese joint forces are now organized and fighting for survival. The general population has been mobilized- plus there is a huge population in al-Fasher right now since it was the last place in that area of Sudan for non-Arabs and government aligned forces to fall back to. I think it's  a \"bridge too far\" for the RSF, as everyone knows the consequences now if the city falls. Further, the Sudanese population outside of Darfur is increasingly hostile to the RSF because they upset the traditional tribal balance of power wherever they go. Whether it's too late for al-Fasher or the rest of Darfur remains to be seen. \n\nThe RSF is stalling out and even seeing a reversal in other parts of Sudan as well currently. However, the Sudanese government has a very long road ahead of it, and I don't know if they have the force generation, equipment, or coffers necessary to take back all of Sudan, at least not by themselves.\n\nWorst case, Sudan is further partitioned into a new state of Darfur in the west and Sudan in the east, de jure or de facto. The UAE wants Port Sudan- I don't think that's going to happen at this point without some serious interference on their part, RSF just doesn't seem to have the capacity. I don't think it's really another \"front\" of the Iranian-UAE proxy war as it's really a sideshow with conflicting interests for almost everyone involved.\n\nThe UAE is trying to keep its involvement seriously under wraps because obviously supporting genocidal tribals isn't exactly great for their imagery as the \"modern, secular, Las Vegas of the Persian Gulf\". I question how much longer they'll support the RSF since the capture of Port Sudan is extremely unlikely at this point, making further extensive support moot. \n\nChad is supporting the RSF, and acting as a conduit for UAE arms to the RSF, however, it is also harming itself by taking on a large amount of the refugees fleeing from RSF atrocities. The demographic shift alone is almost certainly going to cause future instability in Chad, as the Chadian-Sudanese was one of the focal point of the Chadian Civil War, caused by spillover from fighting in Darfur. This is at the same time that the Lake Chad Basin is having a growing Jihadist problem in the west.\n\nIran supports the Sudanese government probably because they're getting some sort of concessions from Sudan- what that is I can't quantify- and like you pointed out it's a good way to drive a wedge against their traditional allies- Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nI have no idea what Russia's overall strategy in Sudan is right now, because their involvement has been pretty schizophrenic from the start. Wagner's support for the RSF and the extractive activities they've conducted at the behest of the RSF is well documented. However, the Sudanese government just affirmed a couple weeks ago their commitment to building a naval base for Russia on the Red Sea, obviously in exchange for Russian training and equipment to be used against the RSF. How this would effect Wagner's (now Afrika Korps) operations with the RSF is unclear. Honestly, they're probably just being opportunists- trying to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nSaudi Arabia supports the Sudanese government- however that support has been mainly political and vocal, at least from what can be seen openly.\n\nAdd to all that- Ukrainian Special Forces have been active in Sudan on the side of the Sudanese government striking Wagner targets and the local nationals they work alongside.\n\nThis all creates a weird situation where you have:\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia supporting the same side against the side backed by a GCC state, Russia seems to currently support \\*both\\* sides, Saudi Arabia- by being shy in it's support- is causing the  government side to turn towards Russia enabling them to acquire a naval base on the Red Sea which Saudi \\*really\\* doesn't want, Iran (and strangely enough Ukraine) are both giving limited yet very impactful support to the side that is harming Wagner's business partners, Chad is almost guaranteeing a further ethnic conflict in eastern Chad by involving itself in supporting and enabling the RSF.\n\nTL;DR: No side is really winning right now, and we may have to add Sudan to the list of seemingly perpetually failed states. I see a future that may soon mimic Libya- two governments with competing outside support and recognition, with lawless wastelands in isolated areas.

FPVs, being one way, have greater range.  If you use an FPV on infantry it's better to go out to 15-20km, and let bomber drones handle anything inside of 10km.

It looks like there&#39;s a little 3D printed safety, but it&#39;s probably not the most reliable thing.</p></li>\n<li><p>The second drone runs into EW again, they dump the munitions and fly home</p></li>\n<li><p>They talk a bit about different types of drones, and how one wouldn&#39;t generally want to waste an FPV on infantry within 10km.  FPVs, being one way, have greater range.  If you use an FPV on infantry it&#39;s better to go out to 15-20km, and let bomber drones handle anything inside of 10km.  Obviously FPVs are more capable against vehicles with the appropriate munition though.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some nearby shelling</p></li>\n<li><p>They talk about Russian aviation, typically they might have 5-7 minutes notice that there&#39;s enemy aviation, when you get notice you run immediately</p></li>\n<li><p>At the end, they mention that they got 5 confirmed kills that day, lost 2 of 3 drones costing about $1400 total, or $280 per Russian soldier killed</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
