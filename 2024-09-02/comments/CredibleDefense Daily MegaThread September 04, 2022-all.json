The first is regarding Ukraine's objectives when they launched this offensive? it may be that everything is going according to plan, that they are advancing at the rate they anticipated, that the casualties they are taking are within anticipated limits and that they are well on the way to achieving what they set out to do. It also may be that they wanted to achieve a decisive breakthrough trapping significant Russian forces on the wrong side of the river and forcing the rest to flee to more easily defensible ground (i.e the east bank). If their expectations were the former then great, if they were the latter then, so far at least, they haven't achieved that. I wonder if this offensive was launched too soon with Ukraine needing a win to keep morale up whilst being worried that, with autumn approaching, they may be running out of time to achieve anything this year (this is, of course, pure speculation).\n\nThe second area of concern is the Russians, they seem to be trying to hold their ground. This suggests one of three things, the first is that political leadership have told tactical commanders that they must stand and fight regardless of the tactical situation, if so that is great news for Ukraine, it means they have the opportunity to deal a decisive blow to the Russians who are playing a bad hand. The second option is that the Russians are fighting a delaying action, trying to inflict maximum losses on the Ukrainians whilst ensuring they can fall back in good order. This is OK for Ukraine, it suggests they will eventually achieve their short term goals but it's unlikely to be a decisive victory. The third is that Russia believe they can hold their ground, that they can withstand the initial assault and degrade the Ukrainians enough that the offensive fizzles out, that would be a significant set back for Ukraine if it happens and would likely mean that Ukraine's chances of retaking any significant ground are over for this year.\n\nThe real issue for me is that I don't know, what is being reported now is just as likely to be Ukrainian success as it is failure and every day that remains unclear my worry will grow.",

What is more important is the outcome, what will Ukraine gain and at what cost. Ukraine has a good position in the sense that there are several possible winning outcomes and Ukraine can shift between them dynamically based on the development on the battlefield.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The third is that Russia believe they can hold their ground, that they can withstand the initial assault and degrade the Ukrainians enough that the offensive fizzles out</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would assume Russians still believe this, it&#39;s too early for them to &quot;give up&quot; mentally. Russia might be forced to change their approach later.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The real issue for me is that I don&#39;t know, what is being reported now is just as likely to be Ukrainian success as it is failure and every day that remains unclear my worry will grow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, it&#39;s unclear for now. But I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath and stress about this so much, this is going to play out in the course of several weeks probably.</p>\n</div>",

Anyway, the whole post sounds like an invitation to commit war crimes.</p>\n\n<p>[https://.me/rybar/38193](https://.me/rybar/38193)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>(add t before .me)  </p>\n\n<p>\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 About the strike on the military hospital in Mykolaiv  </p>\n\n<p>Overnight the Russian Armed Forces struck at Hospital No 1 on Volodarskogo Street in Mykolaiv. The civilian hospital had been converted into a military hospital where they were trying to put the wounded evacuated from the front on their feet.  </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian segment will now try to pass off the episode as an attack on a peaceful civilian hospital.  </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say it again: the strike eliminated wounded AFU servicemen.  </p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd3bOne such action alone succeeded in greatly demoralising the Ukrainian troops on this section of the front. Now they are well aware that the only way to survive is to surrender to the Russian forces.  </p>\n\n<p>It could have been a one-off action, an initiative on the ground, or a mistake in general.  </p>\n\n<p>But we very much hope that both in the command of the Russian Armed Forces and in the military and political leadership a decision in principle has been taken to stop worrying about the lives of Ukrainian servicemen. First of all, the Westerners - they have not been reeducated for more than half a century by the Soviet Union either with a stick in the form of a gulag or with a carrot in the form of a high standard of living.  </p>\n\n<p>It is time to learn a simple truth: every saved life of a wounded man at the frontline, every opportunity to recover and get back in line is a potential exchange of Russian citizens&#39; lives for Ukrainians.  </p>\n\n<p>And every terrorist stunt by the Ukrainian regime and its sponsors must be met with asymmetrical measures in Western Ukraine. Every terrorist attack, a strike on our infrastructure must be accompanied by strikes on the hostile infrastructure.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>\u2757\ufe0f And military hospitals are a legitimate and legitimate target.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t understand why in Syria the field hospitals of Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State have been razed en masse, while in Ukraine it only (inshallah) starts to come to this after half a year of SSOs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
