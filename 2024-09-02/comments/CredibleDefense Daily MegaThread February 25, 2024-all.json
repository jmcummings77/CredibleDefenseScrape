        "body": "On the shells for Ukrainian artillery. According to [Der Spiegel](https://twitter.com/deaidua/status/1761102128624353369), the 120k 122mm shells that Germany recently pledged to Ukraine were found in Bulgaria, have already been paid for and will arrive \"as quickly as possibile\". This is excellent news for Ukraine as will ensure that howitzers of this caliber will enjoy a decent rate of fire for quite a lot of weeks. \n\nAlso, the EU [has promised](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/eu-to-transfer-nearly-170-thousand-shells-to-ukraine-by-the-end-of-march/) that, as part of the EU-organized transfer of shells to Ukraine, 170k shells will arrive by the end of March (I guess, largely, newly produced 155mm shells?). Asking u/Gecktron just in case: I assume that the shells provided by Germany and paid for by them unilaterally are outside the numbers pledged by the EU? \n\nThe news that the 120k 122mm shells promised by Germany have an EU origin also means that they are out of the Czech procurement plan (500k 155mm shells + 300k 122mm shells) that will be sourced from outside the EU. I still have some doubts about the full feasibility of this project - some of the countries rumored to be supplying the shells are South Korea, South Africa and Turkey. South Korea has a large stock and ample production capacity, but it seems that it's only willing to replenish the stockpiles of countries that provide shells to Ukraine, and not to supply them directly (not sure about this, but it seems to me that the use of South Korean 155mm shells in Ukraine has never been proven). Relatively similar situation with South Africa: Rheinmetall has a plant there, and at least a NATO country [purchased](https://www.defense-aerospace.com/rheinmetall-wins-major-contract-for-155mm-artillery-ammunition-from-nato-country/) South African-made 155mm shells (there had been other smaller orders during 2022, I guess it was the Netherlands?). UAWeapons [had identified](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1613542823017447425) a presumably South African-made shell in Ukraine, but I'm pretty sure South Africa prohibits direct export of shells to Ukraine. Turkey is another very important country, as it has good production capacity (it also produces DPICMs) and stocks and above all doesn't seem to have issues in supplying Ukraine directly. Although purchases from Turkey at the EU level are very difficult as they are blocked by some countries, so funding is needed at unilateral level (from Germany, the UK, also the US if new funds are approved, etc.). \n\nAll those three countries aforementioned produce 155mm shells, while it's not clear from whom 122mm shells would come from, in terms of non-EU producers. One of them could be Pakistan, which has already supplied very significant quantities to Ukraine (although it seems there were, at least for some batches, quality and full compatibility problems). This [article](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/25117) suggests that in recent months, perhaps in Turkey but more plausibly in Azerbaijan, a 122mm shell production line has been opened with a production capacity of 30k units per month. Possibly the financing of this production could be part of the Czech plan? I don't know. Another producer of 122m shells from outside the EU is Bosnia-Herzegovina - capacities are presumably limited but the country pushes above its weight in terms of production for Ukraine (particularly for mortar bombs, if I recall correctly). Ditto for Serbia - it seems that through some middlemen Serbian-made shells and rockets quite often end up in Ukraine. Then there are other unlikely suppliers such as India, whose 155mm shell [had been identified](https://defence.in/threads/ukrainian-soldiers-found-operating-indian-ammo-independent-verification-still-pending.1310/), but I am pretty sure their official policy is against direct supplies to Ukraine and the supply may have been a middleman's initiative in violation of agreements. There was also evidence in the past that the Ukrainians used Iranian-made (!) 122mm shells, but it was probably a masterstroke by some Western countries in collaboration perhaps with an African country, and difficult to repeat.\n\nThen there is the matter of the supply from Greek stockpiles that had been announced several months ago and had to be paid for by the US (50k 105mm shells, 20k 155mm shells, 5k 203mm shells) which would be critical especially for 105mm shells, whose situation in terms of availability is very bad. The indirect transfer of 155mm shells, as had been rumored, could be repeated with Japan (as done with South Korea in 2023), but the US (with their deep stockpiles) are needed to allow this. \n\nIn any case: the two donations coming soon from Germany and the EU could give a breath to Ukraine's artillery. If, and I repeat if (and they are big ifs!) the Czech plan succeeds (in terms of funding and full feasibility), the US succeeds in approving a military aid package for Ukraine, and the EU comes at least close to what has promised for 2024, I am not afraid to write that the situation for Ukrainian artillery during 2024 could become more than decent for defensive purposes and there would be a great gap filler in anticipation of Western production increases from 2025 onward.",

These soldiers are not allowed to be attacked or harmed because they pose no threat. The rules of IHL state that these individuals are to be treated humanely and protected from harm.\n\nSurrender can be thought of as a three step process\n\n[**2.1 Attempted surrender (intent)**](https://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/LegalPracticalElementsSurrenderIHL_EN.pdf)\n\n> Regardless, soldiers must make their intent to surrender clear and unequivocal, and do so\nrapidly. Fighting from fortified emplacements is not a manifestation of an intent to surrender,\nand soldiers who fight until the very last possible moment take on certain risks. Their opponent\neither may not see their surrender, may not recognize their actions as an attempt to surrender\nin the heat and confusion of battle, or may find it difficult (if not impossible) to halt an onrushing\nassault to accept a soldier\u2019s last-minute surrender.19 New Zealand\u2019s military doctrine specifies\nthat opposing forces do not dictate the time and place of their surrender. Enemy combatants\ncan be required to wait for a lull in combat activity or for the arrival of more friendly forces\nbefore their surrender is accepted.20 The US Military Manual states that **for an offer of\nsurrender to render a person hors de combat, it must be feasible for the opposing party\nto accept the offer.**21 The feasibility of accepting surrender refers to whether it is practical\nand safe for the opposing force to take custody of the surrendering persons...Similarly, a soldier fifty meters from an enemy defensive position in\nthe midst of an infantry assault by their unit could not throw down their weapon and raise their\narms (as if to indicate their desire to surrender) and reasonably expect that the defending unit\nwould be able to accept and accomplish their surrender while resisting the ongoing assault\n\n\n**2.2 Processing surrender**\n\n>Slowly walking with hands up/behind head, laying down on the ground or crawling on knees\nwithout weapons are examples of safe ways to surrender. The enemy must drop their\nweapons. They approach the contact line with the opposing party or alternatively they are\napproached by the opposing party....Depending on\ncontext, use of force and instruments intended to restrain and limit the freedom of movement\nof a combatant are authorized.\n\n**2.3 Completed surrender**\n\n>Once the adversary has determined that the surrender is genuine and unconditional, that the\nsurrendering combatants are no longer a threat, and that they are no longer willing or able\nto participate in hostilities or defend themselves, the surrendering combatants are said to\nhave \u2018fallen into the power\u2019 of the opposing forces. **From this point onwards, the surrendering\ncombatants cannot be attacked. An act of surrender is complete.** \n\nSimply throwing ones hands up does not automatically confer the protections of a prisoner or the protections under hors de combat. Surrender is a process. \n\n\nI want to add a caveat, that is better said in the link above, \n\n>**The tactical response on a battlefield to any specific security threat posed by a combatant\nintending to surrender ...is  a practical rather\nthan a legal issue.** The process of surrendering comprises certain risks and threats and poses\ninsurmountable challenges to both parties in the conflict. The surrendering party can feign\nsurrender and a tired, hungry, shocked soldier can react instinctively to the enemy soldier and\nnot accept a surrender. \n\nWe can argue till the dogs come home about what we should expect and what is legal, but as a practical matter surrender is incredibly dangerous for both parties, potentially more so then continuing to fight, even if both parties are well intentioned. And for both parties, the legal implications are always going to be secondary to the their survival in that moment.",

The rules of IHL state that these individuals are to be treated humanely and protected from harm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Surrender can be thought of as a three step process</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/LegalPracticalElementsSurrenderIHL_EN.pdf\"><strong>2.1 Attempted surrender (intent)</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regardless, soldiers must make their intent to surrender clear and unequivocal, and do so\nrapidly. Fighting from fortified emplacements is not a manifestation of an intent to surrender,\nand soldiers who fight until the very last possible moment take on certain risks. Their opponent\neither may not see their surrender, may not recognize their actions as an attempt to surrender\nin the heat and confusion of battle, or may find it difficult (if not impossible) to halt an onrushing\nassault to accept a soldier\u2019s last-minute surrender.19 New Zealand\u2019s military doctrine specifies\nthat opposing forces do not dictate the time and place of their surrender. Enemy combatants\ncan be required to wait for a lull in combat activity or for the arrival of more friendly forces\nbefore their surrender is accepted.20 The US Military Manual states that <strong>for an offer of\nsurrender to render a person hors de combat, it must be feasible for the opposing party\nto accept the offer.</strong>21 The feasibility of accepting surrender refers to whether it is practical\nand safe for the opposing force to take custody of the surrendering persons...Similarly, a soldier fifty meters from an enemy defensive position in\nthe midst of an infantry assault by their unit could not throw down their weapon and raise their\narms (as if to indicate their desire to surrender) and reasonably expect that the defending unit\nwould be able to accept and accomplish their surrender while resisting the ongoing assault</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2.2 Processing surrender</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Slowly walking with hands up/behind head, laying down on the ground or crawling on knees\nwithout weapons are examples of safe ways to surrender. The enemy must drop their\nweapons. They approach the contact line with the opposing party or alternatively they are\napproached by the opposing party....Depending on\ncontext, use of force and instruments intended to restrain and limit the freedom of movement\nof a combatant are authorized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2.3 Completed surrender</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once the adversary has determined that the surrender is genuine and unconditional, that the\nsurrendering combatants are no longer a threat, and that they are no longer willing or able\nto participate in hostilities or defend themselves, the surrendering combatants are said to\nhave \u2018fallen into the power\u2019 of the opposing forces. <strong>From this point onwards, the surrendering\ncombatants cannot be attacked. An act of surrender is complete.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Simply throwing ones hands up does not automatically confer the protections of a prisoner or the protections under hors de combat. Surrender is a process. </p>\n\n<p>I want to add a caveat, that is better said in the link above, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The tactical response on a battlefield to any specific security threat posed by a combatant\nintending to surrender ...is  a practical rather\nthan a legal issue.</strong> The process of surrendering comprises certain risks and threats and poses\ninsurmountable challenges to both parties in the conflict. The surrendering party can feign\nsurrender and a tired, hungry, shocked soldier can react instinctively to the enemy soldier and\nnot accept a surrender. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can argue till the dogs come home about what we should expect and what is legal, but as a practical matter surrender is incredibly dangerous for both parties, potentially more so then continuing to fight, even if both parties are well intentioned. And for both parties, the legal implications are always going to be secondary to the their survival in that moment.</p>\n</div>",

It is incumbent on the one surrendering to make his intention to surrender clear. If his intention isn't clear, it doesn't offer protection. The one getting the signal of an intention to surrender is obligated to try to determine if it is genuine, but he isn't obligated to be naive and walk into an obvious trap.

My analysis was right at the time but the trend has changed because of two things:\n\n1. I was basing my prediction on 130 lancets per month but russia has pathetically managed for multiple months to *lower* its production (almost divided by two) however even if they are remarkably mediocre and definitely third world country tier, they recently brought the production back to a record high, yet unimpressive 141 per month.\n\nFor my new prediction I am assuming this will be the mean rate, meaning they can go higher or lower at some points.\n\nmy second error wasn't an error either but a change in the trend, being that I said:\n\n\\> 25% of lancets are expanded towards hitting 155mm tubes.\n\nI said that of the 50% total lancets, half goes towards NATO artillery and half goes toward soviet artillery.\n\nThis was really the trend at the time.\n\nBut NATO artillery has become empirically miserable.\n\nof 63 lancets against Ukraine artillery, only 10, 1/6 targets NATO artillery currently.\n\nThe more time passes, the more NATO artillery disappear from the frontline. Not because they are destroyed, but because like for the abrams or challengers, they don't even try anymore to deploy them on the front.\n\nI also made this observation at the time, that artillery is utterly useless and inaccurate. Hence the incoming nato artillery total attrition will have no consequences. The same way Ukaine retiring its NATO artillery from the frontline has had no impact.\n\nOtherwise you need to come up with a nonsensical explanation as to how 10 SPGs on the whole frontline per month are enough as a coverage.\n\nI already expand on this topic in an essay I am currently writing, which shows the absolute lack of dose response effect, which prove my point.\n\nWhen russia produced 21 lancets per months, they destroyed 11 m777 per month AKA 50% hits, now at 141, it is less than a 10% hit allocation. There are months were production is halved and hit rate on m777 is actually higher.\n\nThe absence of dose response effect and chronological correlations abundantly shows that the NATO artillery is less and less on the front.\n\nOtherwise you would have to hypothetize that they have a magical stealth technology, as the number of Ukraine total destroyed artillery per month keep increasing and is always linear with the absolute number of lancets (45%)\n\nHence at 10 NATO spgs allocated on the front per month, it logically follows, that if evenly spread temporally and the destruction rate is spread too, to simplify, then 2 days every 3 days, AKA 2/third of the month the frontline contains zero NATO SPG (over 40km range) and for the remaining third there is only one NATO SPG per day for the whole frontline.\n\nThis is irefutable and striking. But I predicted such impotence that is in front of the eyes, in extreme obviousness to anyone that actually observe the data. As said, the number of monthly Ukraine artillery losses (63) is record high and the number of NATO artillery losses is record low, consistently, hence the explanation is a retractation from the frontline.",

For one, on top of Ukrainian KIA you also have maybe around twice as many men wounded to the point of no longer being capable of active duty + POWs + MIA. So total irretrievable casualties if there were say 50k Ukrainian KIA would be around 200k. On top of that, the Ukrainian armed forces have more than doubled from their pre-war size. And then on top of *that* Ukraine still needs more men to replace casualties, build new units, and allow for men to be rotated off the lines. That takes a *ton* of manpower. \n\n>Also Russia flies 30 - 40 shorties a day, bombing Ukraine every single day, literally no days off since the start of the war and only 31k killed!?\n\nThe Russian Air Force is likely one of the smallest contributors to Ukrainian casualties. For comparison, the coalition air forces during Desert Storm were launching more than 1,000 sorties *a day* and launched 118k sorties over the course of just a few weeks. \n\nIn Ukraine, artillery is the biggest cause of casualties on both sides by a huge margin.",

Wow, who would have thought that could help? </p>\n\n<p>Jan-May 2023, the UA govt warnings of a UAF offensive against &quot;The South&quot; alerted the Russians who reinforced Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. That time they ignored advice from the US mil brass or other NATO allies and did their plan, which didn&#39;t work. An understatement, they blew through their strategic stockpile of ammo and manpower and had almost nothing to show for it. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-ready-launch-counteroffensive-2023-06-03/\">Zelenskiy says Ukraine ready to launch counteroffensive</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>THAT WAS THE DAY BEFORE THE COUNTEROFFENSIVE STARTED</strong></p>\n\n<p>Seeing a pattern here? </p>\n\n<p>And now President OPSEC Violation spews some crap about the need to be more secretive for success, a whopping two days after already going to the press to describe how he wants to launch another counteroffensive in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>Are.

Of course the rule has not always been followed, but generally speakingRepublican speakers will only deviate from it for matters critical to the government functioning, like budgets.</p>\n\n<p>The discharge petition is another option where a bill can be brought to the floor directly for a vote if a majority of the House signs it, but imo people on this forum especially have overstated how hard getting that is. You don\u2019t just need a handful of Republican representatives, you need a handful of Republican representatives to be willing to undermine their caucus leadership, oppose their (internally) popular presidential candidate, and piss of their colleagues, all for an issue that isn\u2019t super salient to the American people.</p>\n</div>",

During my time in the USAF there were only a select few 14N slots open for OTS candidates and selection into the program itself was less than 20%. Intelligence alone won\u2019t win you a war but it sure as hell will lose you one before it even begins.</p>\n</div>",
