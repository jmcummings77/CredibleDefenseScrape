Gone is the bravado of \"two weeks\" to half-envelop the town from around a month ago. There seems to be a higher recognition that the offensive is becoming too costly, and that Ukrainian redundancies west of Bakhmut would make the town a non-strategic victory in any case. Along with the artillery shortage complaints from the Wagners, some of their milbloggers are also starting to complain of a real shortage of armor that's making hard fought victories more difficult to defend and maintain. This would be in line with an OSINT source that had described a sustained and deliberate Ukrainian tactic to employ Excalibur shells exclusively on IFVs in the salient. Doesn't mean their analysis is right, or credible, but interesting to note the repositioning in tone and dialogue that's occurred over the past week.",

But, for this to work, they would have to reduce the Russian\u2019s mobility to keep them pinned and prevent maneuvering.

According to him, Russian artillery ammo is too low to support that level of destruction now, but they still have the armor to do the latter.

The Tajik branch of\u00a0Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL)\u00a0reported on December 22 that the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) offered Russian passports to more than 119,000 Tajiks between January and September, with the number of acquired citizenships peaking in July-September.[51]\u00a0An expert told\u00a0RFE/RL\u00a0that Russian officials had simplified the acquisition of citizenship for Central Asian migrants by allowing them to sign a contract with the Russian Armed Forces in exchange for a passport. ISW previously reported that the Kremlin initiated a volunteer recruitment campaign between June and September in which federal officials offered citizenship, social benefits, and one-time enlistment bonuses to migrants in exchange for participation in the war.[52]\u00a0The report upset several prominent Russian milbloggers who had made xenophobic remarks that these 119,000 migrants from Tajikistan will never integrate into Russian society, will form their own diasporas that hate Russians, and are already committing violent crimes in Russia.[53]\u00a0One prominent milblogger complained that thousands of people of \u201cforeign culture and ideology\u201d aim to exploit Russian charity while viewing Russia as a colonizing power.[54]\n> \n> The Russian MVD felt compelled to respond to and deflect criticism from Russian nationalists regarding immigration spikes among Central Asian nationals.

It penetrates only into minds already open, and rather than instill opinion it articulates and justifies opinions already present in the minds of its recipients. The gifted propagandist brings to a boil ideas and passions already simmering in the minds of his hearers. He echoes their innermost feelings. Where opinion is not coerced, people can be made to believe only in what they already \u201cknow.\u201d \n> Propaganda by itself succeeds mainly with the frustrated. Their throbbing fears, hopes and passions crowd at the portals of their senses and get between them and the outside world. They cannot see but what they have already imagined, and it is the music of their own souls they hear in the impassioned words of the propagandist. Indeed, it is easier for the frustrated to detect their own imaginings and hear the echo of their own musings in impassioned double-talk and sonorous refrains than in precise words joined together with faultless logic.\n\nIn general, Eric Hoffer contends that people lose themselves to seemingly insane causes by virtue of wanting to escape the misery of their own personal lives and to attach themselves to something greater than themselves that offers a greater future.\n\nYou need to provide more than propaganda. You need to provide belonging, hope, and a vision of a better future for Russian people. Putin is viewed as a great leader because he is seen as being responsible for ending the excesses of the terrible 90s, and improving Russian lives. Of course, it's difficult to explain how much potential improvement Putin also robbed from Russians in his 20+ years of rule, or how any stooge could use oil money to curb graft, buy less yachts and more social services.\n\nThe West has a natural advantage already in that despite much of the \"anti-liberal\"* rhetoric, Russians love their Western inspired culture, trends, and goods. The starkest example, of many, being the recent odd military recruitment ad of a dad joining the military to fight the West so he can buy his daughter an iPhone from California. It's the iPhone that offers hope, not anything Russian.\n\n\\* I don't have a firm understanding of what this term means to Russians. To me, it looks like a vague anti-West catchall. Like fascist is used by Russians as a catchall for anyone that they don't like.",

Indeed, it is easier for the frustrated to detect their own imaginings and hear the echo of their own musings in impassioned double-talk and sonorous refrains than in precise words joined together with faultless logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In general, Eric Hoffer contends that people lose themselves to seemingly insane causes by virtue of wanting to escape the misery of their own personal lives and to attach themselves to something greater than themselves that offers a greater future.</p>\n\n<p>You need to provide more than propaganda. You need to provide belonging, hope, and a vision of a better future for Russian people. Putin is viewed as a great leader because he is seen as being responsible for ending the excesses of the terrible 90s, and improving Russian lives. Of course, it&#39;s difficult to explain how much potential improvement Putin also robbed from Russians in his 20+ years of rule, or how any stooge could use oil money to curb graft, buy less yachts and more social services.</p>\n\n<p>The West has a natural advantage already in that despite much of the &quot;anti-liberal&quot;* rhetoric, Russians love their Western inspired culture, trends, and goods. The starkest example, of many, being the recent odd military recruitment ad of a dad joining the military to fight the West so he can buy his daughter an iPhone from California. It&#39;s the iPhone that offers hope, not anything Russian.</p>\n\n<p>* I don&#39;t have a firm understanding of what this term means to Russians. To me, it looks like a vague anti-West catchall. Like fascist is used by Russians as a catchall for anyone that they don&#39;t like.</p>\n</div>",

If that's the case, they can see about 200-250 miles. \n\nHere are some challenges. \n\nFirst, they'll probably be seen by Ukraine radar. If they are, they have to operate outside of the range of the S300. That's somewhere around 100-150 miles. That gives them about 50-100 miles of operating range to shoot down targets behind enemy lines. \n\nSecond, they'll have to be in the air when Ukraine air force is in the air. That means they'll be on station waiting for the Ukraine air force to fly sorties. Also, they'll be using their radar in order to see Ukraine air assets on the ground. So they'll be giving away their position if Ukraine has EW assets in the area. \n\nThird, if I were doing this, I'd fly 20 mile patterns at 50k feet with mig31s on opposite ends of the pattern (radar is forward looking in jets and you can't get too close to the border or you'll be shot at by S-300s). The Russian Mig-31 will have about 4 hours or station before they run low on fuel or have to go get refueled (Russian refueling has been known to be subpar). \n\nFour, the R-37 flies at about 4000mph and can go about 200 miles (with the booster). That's about 3 minutes to cover the distance. Assuming it takes a minute to determine if a Ukrainian jet is on target, and then 15 seconds to turn and burn, that gives about 1:45 to run from the R-37. My guess is a Mig-29 can do 900mph at low altitude, so that gives them about 25 miles or 17 miles for a 600mph Mig-25. \n\nPut all of that together, and yeah, they operate about 150 miles away from the front line, spot a jet about 200 miles away, shoot when it's less than 175, and they'll be really close to shooting it down. You can see that the Russians can probably shoot down a couple of jets, but it's right on the edge of their capability. \n\nAlso, they'd miss quite a lot. I suspect their hit rate is probably around 25%. And the R-37 is quite an expensive missile. I doubt Russia has many of them (probably a few hundred). \n\nAlso, the Mig-31 would be banging away with their radar, so the Ukrainian jets could see them and avoid them. Dangerous, yeah. There are counters to it, yeah. It also shows how critical the S-300 systems are for Ukraine. If they don't have them, essentially Russia is able to shoot down all aircraft over a larger area of Ukraine. Because other missile defense systems simply do not have the range of the S-300.",

That shift alone could stave conflict off for years to come. But if I'm wrong, victory is by no means guaranteed for the US. Think about it this way: China has one major ocean to contend with to keep its coasts safe. America has and will always have two. This means in a naval arms race, the US better be sure the Navy isn't needed in the Middle East (Iran/terrorist groups) or Europe (Russia)--which isn't the case today. \n\nThis isn't 1942 anymore--we don't have a robust British or Canadian ally which can supply huge raw numbers of ships to pepper enemy shipping in the Atlantic. And nor can we do much to help build it up--much like in 1890, a huge modern fleet is mostly the reserve of great powers, being much too costly for anything less. In a European war, America would do most of the heavy lifting with regards to the Navy. This reduces the naval force available to deploy to the Pacific, perhaps to a critical level. \n\nOne last note: the great naval arms race of the 19th century ended with WW1. The British and Germans had decades to build their dreadnoughts that at the end, which were barely used in direct combat as the ships themselves were too expensive and served better as a deterrent (fleet in being theory). History is a teacher, but we shouldn't overlearn past lessons; we may have until 2053 until a major war breaks out--we may have until tomorrow. And then, we'll go to war with the fleet we have and whatever we build in the time after. \n\nAs it stands, America is in a tough position. Not only is our fleet lesser but our political system leads to a greater questioning of military expenditure. Now, that hasn't happened since 9/11, but a lack of conflict breeds isolationism. Once the war in Ukraine is over, will Congress and voters really back an endless naval arms race with China, seemingly at infinite cost? Maybe not. Maybe, in lieu of spending trillions shoring the defense lines, the far cheaper option will be a pullback from Taiwan, to leave it to the fates, wherever they fall. And maybe, given tech advances, trillions on new carriers would indeed be a waste--much as the carrier killed the dreadnought, who's to say the drone and missile won't do the same for carriers?

Korea, Japan, Guam, and Australia are too far away for combat sorties of anything but big slow bombers. Forget about the F-22 or F-35.</p>\n\n<p>Air superiority would have to be gained by aircraft carriers and 70 FA-18s and F-35Cs, while a formidable force, is probably not going to beat the entire PLAAF <em>and</em> suppress their extensive network of SAMs up and down the seaboard, <em>and</em> sink all their naval based anti air assets.</p>\n</div>",
