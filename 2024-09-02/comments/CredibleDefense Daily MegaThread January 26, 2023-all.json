When the government lifted zero CoVID, it also turned around its messaging on a dime, and started comparing CoVID to the cold.</p>\n</div>",

It includes a commander\u2019s independent thermal viewer. Whereas before, only the gunner had a thermal site, now the tank commander has one as well, allowing them to help scan for and identify targets. The digital system also allows the tank crew to run their own onboard diagnostics, Abrams said, instead of waiting for mechanics to run tests to determine any issues that arise.\n\n>When it comes down to it, Abrams said, the M1A2 is \u201cfar superior in lethality and survivability and mobility\u201d to anything that Russia has on the battlefield.\n\n>It\u2019s unclear which variant of the A2 tank, of which there are three, will be chosen.

Tanks will not only have hugely significant symbolic value, but 100 Western tanks carry significant intrinsic value and will allow the Ukrainians to liberate more territory. \n\n2. Training is possibly already ongoing or will commence quickly. If employed correctly, tanks could allow the Ukrainians to breakthrough key territories by late spring/summer. \n\n3. The tanks could enable Ukraine to sever Russia's ability to support Crimea, get HIMARS into range for certain key targets. \n\n4. Nuclear escalation is highly unlikely.

As you mentioned above this is in no small part due to the fantastic economic foundation of the United States as not only the premier global economy, but also the global centre for innovation (both key to waging and winning war in the 21st century). Many have asked; however, if technology is equal, why can't other rich nations like, say, Saudi Arabia, produce an army at least *near* the quality of US forces? \n\nThe answer is extremely difficult. Earlier historians often puzzled over this: if the Romans could produce legionnaires out of the landholders of rural Italy or, later during the Imperial period, out of pretty much anyone who would join, why could their enemies not do the same? Why do the Gauls or Danes have a historical reputation for *warrior-esque* people, when surely one society could just supply, outfit, and field a similar army? \n\nIt turns out that societies have a tendency to reproduce their social structures on the battlefield. An anti-hierarchal society with a strong tendency towards decentralization might struggle to maintain unit cohesion and thus rely on kin relations to keep the army together (see: the aforementioned Danes). Unlike ancient or medieval era militaries (with some exception), professional modern militaries have a tendency to build parallel social structures to create bonds and enforce discipline (think unit traditions, a strict hierarchy of officers, a strong sense of *purpose* and espirit de corps). In other words, modern armies have actual structures and institutions to create the unique cohesion, culture, and bonds that maximize the advantages afforded by technology, supply, and organization. It's all interlocking. (notably if you want to see a historical example of a society stuck in the middle of the transition, look at how Charlemagne managed his military). This kind of analysis is extraordinarily difficult and is often the last refuge of racists and the lazy (e.g., \"these people fought better because they weren't *soft* and had a *racial characteristic* etc.). \n\nHow is this relevant here? Because it's not enough to simply outfit the UAF and train them on NATO equipment (although this obviously doesn't *hurt*). We've seen examples where that simply fails (the ANA, the modern Saudi military, etc.). Training Ukrainian units is no easy task because (like Charlemagne's retinue) it truly is a military caught in transition between a Soviet Era machine and a modern NATO era one. We should expect to see this level of heterogenous performance due to a whole host of factors (individual commanders, level of training received, experience, etc.).",

This kind of analysis is extraordinarily difficult and is often the last refuge of racists and the lazy (e.g., &quot;these people fought better because they weren&#39;t <em>soft</em> and had a <em>racial characteristic</em> etc.). </p>\n\n<p>How is this relevant here? Because it&#39;s not enough to simply outfit the UAF and train them on NATO equipment (although this obviously doesn&#39;t <em>hurt</em>). We&#39;ve seen examples where that simply fails (the ANA, the modern Saudi military, etc.). Training Ukrainian units is no easy task because (like Charlemagne&#39;s retinue) it truly is a military caught in transition between a Soviet Era machine and a modern NATO era one. We should expect to see this level of heterogenous performance due to a whole host of factors (individual commanders, level of training received, experience, etc.).</p>\n</div>",

It made no sense to the Pentagon to go through the logistical headaches of sending the country\u2019s most advanced tanks to Ukraine when there were very capable German Leopard tanks nearby that could get to Ukraine faster, and operate more efficiently..\n\n>On top of that, several European countries, including Spain, Poland and Finland, were willing to send their German Leopard tanks if Germany would only agree \u2014 a legal requirement that came with their original acquisition of their German-made equipment.\n\n>In senior Biden administration meetings, Mr. Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, laid out the Pentagon position. In subsequent interviews, White House national security officials dutifully repeated the military talking points about why the Abrams did not make sense, while European tanks did.\n\n>But Mr. Austin and General Milley are charged with giving Mr. Biden their best military advice; in this case it clashed with the need to preserve unity among the allies. **What the Pentagon was not taking into enough account, one official said, was the intense fear among European governments of doing anything to provoke Russia without having the cover of the United States doing the same thing first.**\n\n>\u201cLike it or not, that means the United States remains the glue that holds NATO and Europe together,\u201d said Peter Juul, a national security analyst in the newsletter The Liberal Patriot.\n\n>...\n\n>\u201cIt seems that the issue all along has been a political, not military one,\u201d said Evelyn Farkas, the Pentagon\u2019s senior official for Ukraine in the Obama administration. \u201cAnd our military leaders should have greenlighted the Abrams long ago to provide reinforcement to the Germans that collective security would prevail.\u201d\n\n>**\u201cWhat is stunning about it is how afraid our allies are about facing Russia without the United States,\u201d she added.**\n\n>**Mr. Austin himself arrived at that conclusion after the meeting in Germany ended without a decision on the German tanks, according to aides, telling associates that he did not see the sense of risking a \u201cfracture\u201d in NATO or a rift with Germany over the issue.**\n\n>Some Pentagon officials were taken aback that German officials were publicly admitting the link between the Abrams tanks and the Leopards, one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He added that officials had thought those communications would only be internal.\n\n>**By Monday, officials said both Mr. Austin and General Milley were onboard with sending American tanks to Germany. To make the point \u2014 or to be seen making the point \u2014 Mr. Austin called Mr. Biden on Monday to recommend sending the Abrams tanks.**\n\n>While some lawmakers had suggested the United States needed to send as few as a single Abrams tank to unlock the German Leopards, the Pentagon leaders said that made no sense. If the United States was going to send its most advanced tank system, it should send a battalion with \u201ccombat power,\u201d one official said.\n\n>A Ukrainian battalion has 31 tanks, so that was the amount the United States agreed to send, Pentagon officials said.\n\nNATO is still USA & Friends",

In subsequent interviews, White House national security officials dutifully repeated the military talking points about why the Abrams did not make sense, while European tanks did.</p>\n\n<p>But Mr. Austin and General Milley are charged with giving Mr. Biden their best military advice; in this case it clashed with the need to preserve unity among the allies. <strong>What the Pentagon was not taking into enough account, one official said, was the intense fear among European governments of doing anything to provoke Russia without having the cover of the United States doing the same thing first.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201cLike it or not, that means the United States remains the glue that holds NATO and Europe together,\u201d said Peter Juul, a national security analyst in the newsletter The Liberal Patriot.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt seems that the issue all along has been a political, not military one,\u201d said Evelyn Farkas, the Pentagon\u2019s senior official for Ukraine in the Obama administration. \u201cAnd our military leaders should have greenlighted the Abrams long ago to provide reinforcement to the Germans that collective security would prevail.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cWhat is stunning about it is how afraid our allies are about facing Russia without the United States,\u201d she added.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mr. Austin himself arrived at that conclusion after the meeting in Germany ended without a decision on the German tanks, according to aides, telling associates that he did not see the sense of risking a \u201cfracture\u201d in NATO or a rift with Germany over the issue.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some Pentagon officials were taken aback that German officials were publicly admitting the link between the Abrams tanks and the Leopards, one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. He added that officials had thought those communications would only be internal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>By Monday, officials said both Mr. Austin and General Milley were onboard with sending American tanks to Germany. To make the point \u2014 or to be seen making the point \u2014 Mr. Austin called Mr. Biden on Monday to recommend sending the Abrams tanks.</strong></p>\n\n<p>While some lawmakers had suggested the United States needed to send as few as a single Abrams tank to unlock the German Leopards, the Pentagon leaders said that made no sense. If the United States was going to send its most advanced tank system, it should send a battalion with \u201ccombat power,\u201d one official said.</p>\n\n<p>A Ukrainian battalion has 31 tanks, so that was the amount the United States agreed to send, Pentagon officials said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NATO is still USA &amp; Friends</p>\n</div>",

On the right bank near Kherson for example I expected them to have much more trouble supplying their troops but by all accounts that I read that wasn't the case. \n\nRegarding HIMARS, the logistics guys have no control over how often they get hit. They dispersed their supply points much slower than they should have which is absolutely a strike against them but  even so managed to keep enough shells flowing that things didn't fall apart on the front even if they had to ultimately halt their offensive. And of course Wagner says that, they've been taking any opportunity to criticize the regular army. It doesn't mean they're wrong but I'm not going to be taking their word for it either. \n\nTheir logistics at the start of the war were pretty shit around Kyiv but that was in the face of a widespread sabotage campaign in Belarus and the decision to have nearly undefended glocs.

        "body": "I'm still trying to wrap my head around exactly what's going on around Bakhmut. Ukraine has/had some pretty solid defensive lines in the area and has, at least on paper, a large number of professional soldiers holding the area, including several of their best maneuver brigades and tons of artillery. \n\nBut we keep hearing stories that the Ukrainian units around Bakhmut are outnumbered and outgunned, and suffering significant losses on a daily basis. Is this right? On paper Ukraine shouldn't be heavily outnumbered or outgunned. \n\nRegardless, Ukrainian forces have clearly been losing considerable territory over the past 1-2 months. Russia is steadily enveloping Bakhmut proper and is well on its way to cutting off its supply lines. \n\nKofman has also noted that he's heard a lot of grumbling from Ukrainian colleagues that Ukraine is trading professional troops for Wagner convicts, which is a terrible trade, and there was a story yesterday or the day before that the US is urging Ukraine to conserve its maneuver units for a future offensive and reconsider their defemse of Bakhmut. There are also a lot of rumors of incompetent Ukrainian commanders in the area getting Ukrainian troops killed, likely by trying to hold terrain they shouldn't and launching poorly planned and coordinated counterattacks. \n\nSo I'm trying to get a better understanding of what's happening around Bakhmut. Is it a failure of Ukrainian command, enacting a poor and costly defense trying to hold territory it shouldn't? Are they really squandering their limited offensive potential on this incompetent defense? Is Russian success really a result of drowning Ukrainian forces in conscript/convict blood and then hammering the identified Ukrainian defenses with artillery and their professional forces?\n\nIs there something I'm missing?

Ukraine has/had some pretty solid defensive lines in the area and has, at least on paper, a large number of professional soldiers holding the area, including several of their best maneuver brigades and tons of artillery. </p>\n\n<p>But we keep hearing stories that the Ukrainian units around Bakhmut are outnumbered and outgunned, and suffering significant losses on a daily basis. Is this right? On paper Ukraine shouldn&#39;t be heavily outnumbered or outgunned. </p>\n\n<p>Regardless, Ukrainian forces have clearly been losing considerable territory over the past 1-2 months. Russia is steadily enveloping Bakhmut proper and is well on its way to cutting off its supply lines. </p>\n\n<p>Kofman has also noted that he&#39;s heard a lot of grumbling from Ukrainian colleagues that Ukraine is trading professional troops for Wagner convicts, which is a terrible trade, and there was a story yesterday or the day before that the US is urging Ukraine to conserve its maneuver units for a future offensive and reconsider their defemse of Bakhmut. There are also a lot of rumors of incompetent Ukrainian commanders in the area getting Ukrainian troops killed, likely by trying to hold terrain they shouldn&#39;t and launching poorly planned and coordinated counterattacks. </p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m trying to get a better understanding of what&#39;s happening around Bakhmut. Is it a failure of Ukrainian command, enacting a poor and costly defense trying to hold territory it shouldn&#39;t? Are they really squandering their limited offensive potential on this incompetent defense? Is Russian success really a result of drowning Ukrainian forces in conscript/convict blood and then hammering the identified Ukrainian defenses with artillery and their professional forces?</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I&#39;m missing? For the amount of resources, especially limited and invaluable professional maneuver forces, Ukraine has poured into this fight they should be showing better results.</p>\n</div>",

Russia is steadily enveloping Bakhmut proper and is well on its way to cutting off its supply lines.\n\nIt really hasn't.  Ukraine has lost a few miles around Bakhmut, while Ukraine has gained a few miles further north.  It takes months for either side to secure a single town.  At the current rate of advance, the sun is going to go nova before either side captures the territory enough to matter.  The lines are basically static.  It's really a matter of attrition right now.  \n\nBoth armies are wearing themselves down on each other for basically no territorial gain.  They are trying to wear each other down enough that one side's logistics or will breaks, and they can make real territorial advancement.  The only value in holding a place currently is because it's a good place to kill the other side, or it's a good place to hold to prepare for a real maneuver warfare thrust.\n\nI'd expect big movements to look more like Kherson or Kharkiv where the two sides grind for a long time with little movement, and then suddenly one side decides they can't take the losses anymore, and so retreats to a more defensible position to continue the attrition process.  No one wants to retreat to a more defensible position because it is politically painful, and you end up taking disproportionate losses in the the retreat.\n\nThe only real question right now is who is losing more in any battlefield, and that is pretty damn opaque right now.",

            "body": "First off, we don't and won't know what is happening at the tactical level so it's futile trying to draw hard conclusions. Without knowing the specifics we're operating in the dark, and between OPSEC and propaganda there is no way to know what is real and what isn't. Until the media, ISW, Ukrainian GenStab, etc decide to enlighten us with unvarnished truth, or the Russians do it and are honest for a change, we're not going to know. \n\nSo any speculation in the OSINT world is going to be pretty bad. \n\n>But we keep hearing stories that the Ukrainian units around Bakhmut are outnumbered and outgunned, and suffering significant losses on a daily basis. Is this right?\n\nWith regards to being outgunned, that's possible if the UAF artillery battalions aren't at full strength or limited in fires due to ammo shortage, supply issues or successful Russian counterbattery. There are definitely at least two UAF separate artillery brigades supporting the battle, possibly three, and those are their best equipment, most UAVs, etc. They'd not have committed that number unless it's incredibly important, but after being committed I find it hard to believe the Russians have fire superiority. Additionally, committing so many to Bakhmut WOULD limit their offensive capabilities elsewhere, as the UAF are utterly reliant on arty to make any forward progress against dug in Russians.\n\nIn terms of personnel, as of early January, the Russians supposedly had 40 maneuver battalions involved in the Bakhmut operation, which would come out to about 8-13 UAF brigades, or less since numerous reports are suggesting UAF brigades have between 6-10 battalions now (likely due to lack of brigade level command, staff, and support necessary to create new ones). Meanwhile, most OSINT info suggests there are that many UAF brigades in the area.. To successfully attack usually requires outnumbering the defenders,, especially in urban terrain or against fixed defenses, at ratios some so range from 3:1 to 5:1, sometimes as high as 10:1, especially if casualties are heavy and expected, so I'm not really seeing a way the Russians grossly outnumber the Ukrainians.\n\n>Kofman has also noted that he's heard a lot of grumbling from Ukrainian colleagues that Ukraine is trading professional troops for Wagner convicts, which is a terrible trade\n\nI said this back in early December when I thought this battle could be purposeful Russian fixing action, because it was forcing a major Ukrainian commitment to send its best troops and most valuable artillery pieces to trade losses with Russian crap. Even if it's not meant as a fixing action, it's still serving as one, which means that yes, the Ukrainians are losing offensive capabilities by defending Bakhmut.\n\n>the day before that the US is urging Ukraine to conserve its maneuver units for a future offensive and reconsider their defemse of Bakhmut\n\nI believe they're wanting the UAF to stop focusing on costly battles of attrition and instead focusing on maneuver warfare. It's not about Bakhmut itself, it's about shifting the mindset that leads to battles such as Bakhmut. \n\n>There are also a lot of rumors of incompetent Ukrainian commanders in the area getting Ukrainian troops killed, likely by trying to hold terrain they shouldn't and launching poorly planned and coordinated counterattacks. \n\nThose could only be among the GenStab. There is no commander anywhere in OC-E doing anything unique that hasn't been policy since the war started.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>First off, we don&#39;t and won&#39;t know what is happening at the tactical level so it&#39;s futile trying to draw hard conclusions. Without knowing the specifics we&#39;re operating in the dark, and between OPSEC and propaganda there is no way to know what is real and what isn&#39;t. Until the media, ISW, Ukrainian GenStab, etc decide to enlighten us with unvarnished truth, or the Russians do it and are honest for a change, we&#39;re not going to know. </p>\n\n<p>So any speculation in the OSINT world is going to be pretty bad. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But we keep hearing stories that the Ukrainian units around Bakhmut are outnumbered and outgunned, and suffering significant losses on a daily basis. Is this right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With regards to being outgunned, that&#39;s possible if the UAF artillery battalions aren&#39;t at full strength or limited in fires due to ammo shortage, supply issues or successful Russian counterbattery. There are definitely at least two UAF separate artillery brigades supporting the battle, possibly three, and those are their best equipment, most UAVs, etc. They&#39;d not have committed that number unless it&#39;s incredibly important, but after being committed I find it hard to believe the Russians have fire superiority. Additionally, committing so many to Bakhmut WOULD limit their offensive capabilities elsewhere, as the UAF are utterly reliant on arty to make any forward progress against dug in Russians.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of personnel, as of early January, the Russians supposedly had 40 maneuver battalions involved in the Bakhmut operation, which would come out to about 8-13 UAF brigades, or less since numerous reports are suggesting UAF brigades have between 6-10 battalions now (likely due to lack of brigade level command, staff, and support necessary to create new ones). Meanwhile, most OSINT info suggests there are that many UAF brigades in the area.. To successfully attack usually requires outnumbering the defenders,, especially in urban terrain or against fixed defenses, at ratios some so range from 3:1 to 5:1, sometimes as high as 10:1, especially if casualties are heavy and expected, so I&#39;m not really seeing a way the Russians grossly outnumber the Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kofman has also noted that he&#39;s heard a lot of grumbling from Ukrainian colleagues that Ukraine is trading professional troops for Wagner convicts, which is a terrible trade</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I said this back in early December when I thought this battle could be purposeful Russian fixing action, because it was forcing a major Ukrainian commitment to send its best troops and most valuable artillery pieces to trade losses with Russian crap. Even if it&#39;s not meant as a fixing action, it&#39;s still serving as one, which means that yes, the Ukrainians are losing offensive capabilities by defending Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the day before that the US is urging Ukraine to conserve its maneuver units for a future offensive and reconsider their defemse of Bakhmut</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe they&#39;re wanting the UAF to stop focusing on costly battles of attrition and instead focusing on maneuver warfare. It&#39;s not about Bakhmut itself, it&#39;s about shifting the mindset that leads to battles such as Bakhmut. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are also a lot of rumors of incompetent Ukrainian commanders in the area getting Ukrainian troops killed, likely by trying to hold terrain they shouldn&#39;t and launching poorly planned and coordinated counterattacks. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those could only be among the GenStab. There is no commander anywhere in OC-E doing anything unique that hasn&#39;t been policy since the war started. What makes Bakhmut unique again is it&#39;s another casualty heavy battle where both sides are ruthlessly slugging it out over territory as a priority. Every time that happens there are complaints from UAF troops about their chain of command, like in Popasna, Severodonetsk, Pisky, etc. Nobody likes being a pawn but that&#39;s the life of a soldier, especially an infantryman. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it a failure of Ukrainian command, enacting a poor and costly defense trying to hold territory it shouldn&#39;t?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they&#39;re going to enforce a strategic policy not to give up any ground unless they can&#39;t hold it, then holding Bakhmut as long as possible makes sense if they value holding ground more than lives or even prospects of future offensive capability. </p>\n\n<p>If they think by doing that they&#39;re going to win a battle of attrition, which a lot of reports attest was at least partly the reasoning for ruthlessly defending territory in the past and Bakhmut, then that made sense in the fall and early winter before it became apparent the trade off wasn&#39;t in their favor.

Clips of [AFU talking to civilians](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/10l4vmj/ua_pov_ukrainian_mobilization_in_berezovka_odessa/) where nothing appears to happen.\n\n3.

Videos that exist for [no apparent reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/10l4xf7/ua_pov_ukrainian_military_looking_for_citizens_to/), perhaps to remind their target audience that \"Ukraine is losing\".\n\nThese are all from a single day, they've been like this awhile but for some reason lately there's a new 'push' for them.

I guess the exception may be submarines, since it allows them to maintain their nuclear triad. A counter argument to that is that the Arctic is rapidly becoming a more strategically important area, and a navy is nessecary if they want to project power there. However, in the end, Russia doesn\u2019t have a unlimited amount of resources, and will probably be forced to prioritise between which areas they aim to project power, such as Central Asia, Eastern Europe or the Arctic. Another argument for spending on their navy, may be that Russian officials still consider them a great power, and consequently they may consider that maintaining a large navy is necessary in order to maintain that perception. \n\nBut regarding the airforce, one could make the argument that a central reason for why the Russian Air Force has underperformed is due to a lack of funding. This could have contributed to everything from a lack of flying hours, to that the majority of their airforce consists of outdated soviet aircraft, that their ISR capabilities are clearly far behind NATOs, that they don\u2019t have a large number of precision guided munitions and their lack of a large number of advanced drones(evident by their purchase of shahed drones). \n\nTherefore, I could absolutely see Russia investing heavily into their Air Force after the war. Especially drones is a area that I could see Russia focusing heavily on. After all, one could make the argument that drones has been some of Russians best performing weapons in the war. For example, there are countless of videos showing lancet drones taking out various Ukrainian vehicles. And while they are slow and vulnerable to chain link fencing(above the vehicles) they are also probably incredibly cheap and simple to manufacture and simple to use for conscripts(I don\u2019t have data any data on this, but I assume it\u2019s a reasonable assumption to make). Their orlan drones has also been a constant issue for the Ukrainians, and while they are vulnerable to air defences, I have yet to see any indication that they are running out of them, which means they are probably relatively easy to manufacture. Finally you have the shaheds, which has caused significant issues for Ukraine. They are also available in large quantities, and have caused significant issues for Ukraine. Sure, they can\u2019t take out a hardened bunker, but they can absolutely damage a power grid. Another advantage with all the above mentioned drones, is that in addition to that they are cheap and easy to manufacture, Ukraine has often been forced to use more expensive systems to take them out. For example, using a iris-t system to take out a shahed or orlan drone is probably not very a economical trade off. And finally, it\u2019s probably relatively cheap to significantly improve these drones after the war. For example, they could probably significantly improve the speed and flight time of Lancets, make orlans able to gather and transmit more data, and make a stealthier version of the shahed.
