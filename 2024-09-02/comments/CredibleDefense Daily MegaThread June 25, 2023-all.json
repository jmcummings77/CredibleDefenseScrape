            "body": "(Reposting from the main thread, where I've posted this before I saw this stickied comment. I removed the old one.)\n\nI try to avoid even the barest attempts at drawing conclusions about something while it's still unfolding, as selection bias in open sources is very real, and very difficult to trace. IMHO, while the \"acute phase\" of the armed insurgency is probably done by now, the rift between the two factions is still very much not quenched, so it's also very early to draw any conclusions about this in general.\n\nHowever, I do think we've seen enoug that we can at least make an initial list of indicators to watch for so that we can have an idea about *what* is unfolding, and in which direction. That is, we can at least make a list of hypotheses that we can try to prove or disprove in the coming months, which might give us an indication about what's happened without waiting for documents to be declassified, interviews to be taken, and historians to write books.\n\nThere are three underlying assumptions behind this list:\n\n1. That the entire insurgency (troops taking over Rostov, then marching towards Moscow) was not staged. If it was, all of this is obviously an useless exercise. But I do think it's quite unlikely that it was staged. It involved real victims in the VKS, real loss of equipment, and a dangerous image gamble doesn't really fit Putin's careful, planned approach to image building. His modus operandi is closer to staging apartment bombings, where there's not even a theoretical danger of anyone siding with the \"other\" side.\n2. That the Wagner PMC enjoyed the support of a group of politicians, if not yesterday, at the very least up to their offensive on Bakhmut, and that there were other politicians who disagreed. Speculation on who exactly these people were is something I'd leave to people more familiar with the contemporary Russian political scene; for all we know, Putin himself may have been in one of these groups, and the other guys may have been unwilling to voice their disagreement too publicly. These groups may also have been formed after Wagner's rift with the MoD started -- that is, until we know exactly how it happened, I think we should be equally open both to the possibility that Prigozhin's conflict with the military leadership began and unfolded the way it did because Prigozhin enjoyed political protection early on, and to the possibility that political protection coalesced after the rift started and as it unfolded, because some people bet Wagner, not the MoD, would emerge as the major winner in the wake of the very poorly-handled February invasion.\n3. That the Wagner leadership saw itself as sufficiently autonomous from the Federal government, and held sufficient privileges (in the loose sense of the word) that it thought its autonomy and privileges were worth protecting. In other words, I am assuming this wasn't quite the same as a railway workers' strike with guns, where people are unhappy with their bosses and they start getting violent, but essentially acknowledge their legal and formal subordination, and seek a change in employment status or working conditions, or to get a really awful manager fired, after which they're happy to return to work. Instead, I'm assuming that, while obviously accepting the kind of subordination any organisation in Russia owes to the Russian legal system and government, it saw its activities, including its operations in Ukraine, as independently-pursued in collaboration with the Federal government, the way e.g. a contractor builds a railway or a motorway, and not as an organisational facade for a faction of the Russian army.\n\nWith these things in mind, here's what I would watch out in the coming weeks and months, broken down by topic.\n\n**How did this affect Putin's regime?** A PMC column marching on Moscow, shooting down aircraft in the process and precipitating official response (from speeches to sandbag position building) is not exactly a show of strength. \"Strength\" is people not even daring to wrap sausages with newspaper pages with the leader's faces -- implying they allowed themselves to be deceived by their subordinates, usurping their military command, and driving off to the capital city, then being granted amnesty for what was immediately labeled as one of the capital crimes in any nation, show the exact opposite of that. \n\nHowever, I think it's also fair to say that, whatever the mismatch between the power Putin wished he wielded and the power he *actually* wielded, he has, so far, wielded more than Wagner, since he's obviously still in the Kremlin and Wagner went back. The real questions, IMHO, are:\n\na) Did Putin offer Prigozhin this unexpected settlement because he negotiated from a position of strength and sought to avoid bloodshed at a time when human and equipment resources are sorely needed elsewhere, or because both he and Prigozhin negotiated from a position of uncertainty, or even weakness, and while neither party could walk back on their earlier grand statements of grand punishment, they also didn't want to test their ability to implement them?\n\nb) Did the Federal government retain sufficient political capital to retain, or even improve its position of control over state resources, or to the contrary, did this weaken the political status of the MoD, the Federal government in general, and possibly Putin himself, suggesting there's a power vacuum that other factions in the state apparatus, or other non-state actors, might fill?\n\nIMHO, if Putin did negotiate from a position of strength, and only postponed a more severe resolution so as to minimise its military and economic impact, then I think based on Soviet precedent and on what we've seen from Putin before, we should see:\n\n* No leadership changes in the MoD in the following months\n* A purging of figures associated with Wagner, both from military and non-military positions -- amnesty means one gets to walk out with their life but no one said anything about their job -- some of it followed by legal retribution on unrelated charges (amnesty for military insurgency doesn't cover, say, embezzlement, does it?) to ensure they stay out\n* A transfer of overseas Wagner operations to more reliable partners\n* A stricter regime for PMCs, which would guarantee better state control over their operation and leadership\n\nIf, instead, this was both parties avoiding a hot conflict, I think at a minimum we'll see Wagner retaining their overseas operations and no legal retribution against anyone who loses their job after this. If Wagner no longer participates in operations in Ukraine, there's probably no reason for changes in the MoD leadership, either, so I don't think Shoigu and Gerasimov keeping their jobs would be particularly significant in this event.\n\nControl over external resources would IMHO be the real canary in the coal mine: if these two parties negotiated as equals, they may have only settled to remove the reason of their initial misunderstanding -- i.e. the handling of operations in Ukraine -- and agreed to just go back to their very lucrative prior understanding. If Putin negotiated from a position of strength and practically obliterated Wagner, then I expect we'll see it slowly dismantled, and removing one of their main sources of income would be the absolutely necessary step.\n\nI'm not sure what to say about b). That one's a little looser: the real problem the federal government is facing at this point IMHO is that, even if they do formally dismantle Wagner, they now have 5-25K people with guns, military experience, uncertain employment prospects, and some of them got a get out of jail card for just about the worst offense you can commit against the government. At this point, the federal government's monopoly over violence and the issuing of orders to military forces, one of the pillars of state status, got challenged very badly, and the government's response, though it avoided violence, also left the question of whether it still holds this monopoly unresolved.\n\n**Did Lukashenko secure an independent military for himself, and what role could he have played in all this?** Prigozhin getting exile in *Belarus* of all places is bizarre. If this is just postponing execution or assassination, what's the point of a detour via Minsk? If this is a way of giving Prigozhin safety guarantees, Belarus is probably the worst place for it.\n\nc) What does all this tell us about Lukashenko's current status?\n\nIMHO I think that, if security guarantees for Prigozhin in Belarus do turn out to be real, and Lukashenko really managed to play a mediator's role, we should think about reviewing our idea of the kind of balance of power between his regime and Putin's. Belarus got very little out of their support for Russia against Ukraine, so everyone's knee-jerk reaction was to assume this was a symptom of Lukashenko's regime being a hollow, powerless agent of Moscow's interests.\n\nBut if Prigozhin's still alive, well, and prospering in Belarus in a few months, maybe handling some official function, or serving in some advisory position, it may be fair to conclude that Lukashenko really did some real mediation work, that he could back up with real guarantees, rather than that his \"mediation\" was just some make-believe facade meant to save face while postponing punishment for Prigozhin.",

            "body": "I added my take on the Prigohzin reversal/capitulation on the thread yesterday, and I'm adding it here as well as I am seeing a lot of 11-D chess takes that seem to me unlikely.\n\nThere does seem to be a rather mundane rationale that fits all known facts, and I'm unsure why a lot of theorising is required to explain it.\n\nThe two real fact we do know is \n\n1) There was a deal on the table at that point (this was not guaranteed to be true later) and\n\n2) That the deal was agreed to at the point the Wagner column had reached the Oka riverbut had not yet crossed the bridges over the river here that they needed to cross to take them into Moscow city proper.\n\nThis, by itself, may offer our rationale for why the attack halted..... there are reasonably 3 bridges crossing that river they may have taken, and we have credible sources claiming these were well manned with Moscow-based Spetsnatz/FSB SoF/GRU SoF units that we can assume had higher than usual loyalty to the regime and/or may have already mined the bridges ready to blow them (or could credibly claim to have done so to the Wagner commander on the scene).\n\nI summarised it as this the other day....\n\n>Its interesting the deal was struck at the moment the column reached the Oka river.\n\n>It may be Prighozin realised the game was up when the column commander radio'd him and said \"The bridges are well defended, by forces that won't agree to let us pass and the bridges are mined to blow if we try and force it.

An analysis by Tatiana Stanovaya, Senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\n\n> Below is a brief description of Prigozhin's mutiny and the factors that contributed to its outcome. We, as observers, initially missed important details due to the scarcity of information and lack of time for in-depth analysis. Here's the perspective that currently seems most plausible:\n\n> 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Prigozhin's rebellion wasn't a bid for power or an attempt to overtake the Kremlin. It arose from a sense of desperation; Prigozhin was forced out of Ukraine and found himself unable to sustain Wagner the way he did before, while the state machinery was turning against him. To top it off, Putin was ignoring him and publicly supporting his most dangerous adversaries.\n\n> 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Prigozhin's objective was to draw Putin's attention and to impose a discussion about conditions to preserve his activities  - a defined role, security, and funding. These weren't demands for a governmental overthrow; they were a desperate bid to save the enterprise, hoping that Prigozhin's merits in taking Bakhmut (that's why he needed it!) would be taken into account and the concerns would catch Putin's serious attention. Now it appears that these merits helped Prigozhin to get out of this crisis alive, but without a political future in Russia (at least while Putin is in power). \n\n> 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Prigozhin was caught off-guard by Putin's reaction and found himself unprepared to assume the role of a revolutionary. He also wasn't prepared for the fact that Wagner was about to reach Moscow where his only option remained - to \"take the Kremlin\" - an action that would inevitably result in him and his fighters being eradicated.\n\n> 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Those in the elites who were able reached out to Prigozhin with offers to surrender. This likely added to his sense of impending doom. However, I don't believe any high-level negotiations took place. Lukashenko presented Prigozhin with a Putin-endorsed offer to retreat on the condition that Prigozhin would leave Russia and Wagner would be dissolved.\n\n> 5\ufe0f\u20e3 I don't think Prigozhin was in a position to make demands (such as the resignation of Shoigu or Gerasimov - something many observers expect today. If that happens, it will be due to another reason.) After Putin's address in the morning of June 24th, Prigozhin's primary concern was to find an off-ramp. The situation would have led to inevitable death in merely a few hours. It is possible that Putin has promised him safety on the condition that Prigozhin remains quietly in Belarus.\n\n> I stand by my previous assertion that Putin and the state have been dealt a severe blow (which will have significant repercussions for the regime). However, I want to emphasize that image has always been a secondary concern for Putin. Setting optics aside, Putin objectively resolved the Wagner and Prigozhin problem by dissolving the former and expelling the latter. The situation would have been far worse if it had culminated in a bloody mess in the outskirts of Moscow.\n\n> And no, Putin doesn't need Wagner or Prigozhin. He can manage with his own forces. He's now certainly convinced of that.",

Girkin openly accused Prigozhin of planning to conduct a coup amid the upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive and of continuously violating Russian censorship laws against the discreditation of the Russian army and military command.[19] Girkin warned of \u201cmutiny\u201d if Prigozhin is \u201callowed\u201d to lead the Wagner Group. Girkin noted that Prigozhin ordered for the Wagner forces to withdraw to the Wagner bases deep inside of Russia on the eve of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. He also claimed that Wagner personnel had never taken oaths promising not to engage in combat against Russia or its military.[20] Prigozhin stated on May 27 that Wagner will decide later on if it will fight in Ukraine or in another country, which indicates that Prigozhin retains the ability to command his own army outside of the formal Russian military command structure.[21] Girkin also recently criticized the Russian military command for failing to address Prigozhin\u2019s open and vulgar conflict with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD), even warning that Prigozhin will \u201cdevour\u201d the Russian military officials who \u201cbet\u201d in his favor as he seeks to increase his political power.[22] A member of Girkin\u2019s Angry Patriots Club claimed that the conflict between Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Prigozhin is developing into a conflict between the Russian military and Wagner forces but that Putin is not paying attention.[23]",

The volume of rubles is a stark example of the distortions caused by the war that\u2019s now in its 16th month.\n\n>The amount of currency in circulation has soared at a record pace since September, when President Vladimir Putin announced Russia\u2019s first mobilization since World War II, resulting in 2.2 trillion rubles in cumulative excess cash outflows from banks, according to Bloomberg Economics.\n\n>Given the restrictions imposed on bank transactions, the use of paper money is becoming more widespread to settle external trade while also extending into occupied parts of Ukraine, where Russia is imposing its own currency as other payment options remain limited.\n\n>Headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a sanctioned Russian businessman linked to Putin, Wagner deployed to Ukraine as early as March last year and eventually bolstered its ranks by recruiting convicts from Russian prisons. \n\n>Prigozhin hasn\u2019t tried to hide how his forces get paid. In an audio comment published this month by his Concorde company, he said fighters \u201cget all the money in black cash.\u201d\n\n>\u201cPeople from penal colonies went to war so that the people of the Russian Federation could sit at home by the stoves and warm themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they died for this black cash.\u201d\n\n>Though the sources of Wagner\u2019s funding aren\u2019t clear, its involvement has meant that even more outlays on the war flow off the books. \n\n>>\u201cAn expansion in the use of cash may indicate a variety of changes in Russia\u2019s economy \u2014 none of them good.

Responsibility for overseeing the system of cash circulation lies with central bank Deputy Governor Sergey Belov, a military officer who\u2019s also in charge of special institutions that channel funding from the state budget to frontline troops.\n\n>In response to a request for comment, the Bank of Russia pointed to several likely reasons for what it called \u201celevated demand\u201d for cash since the final quarter of last year.\n\n>Among the factors is \u201cpossible additional\u201d demand for paper money in Russia\u2019s \u201cnew regions,\u201d it said, referring to parts of eastern and southern Ukraine annexed by Putin last September. The central bank also cited the role of public-sector payments that people tend to withdraw partly in cash and the needs of tourists during the May holiday season in Russia.\n\n>>Cashing In\n\n>Money earmarked for the military, including regular troops, is a major reason why cash is increasingly becoming the medium of choice, according to officials familiar with the Russian authorities\u2019 thinking.

What\u2019s changed is that \u201cthere\u2019s now another source of demand for cash, linked to the special military operation,\u201d he said, using the Kremlin\u2019s preferred term for the war.\n\n>Russians hauled cash out of banks in then-record amounts in February 2022, a month that culminated in Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine. But the frenzy proved short-lived, as the Bank of Russia drew funds back into the financial system with an emergency hike to interest rates that helped restore confidence.\n\n>Currency in circulation has recorded 10 months of almost uninterrupted growth that took it around 1.4 trillion rubles past the peak reached in March 2022, according to central bank data. It\u2019s a timeframe that aligns with the Kremlin\u2019s call-up and the assault often led by Wagner on the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut \u2014 the longest and bloodiest battle of the war so far.\n\n>Contracts are signed with another company owned by Prigozhin, and cash is delivered several times a month by car to a Wagner base in southern Russia, Gabidullin said from France.\n\n>\u201cAll disbursements, bonuses, funeral payouts and others have always been made only in cash, in envelopes \u2014 both then and now,\u201d he said.\n\n>The cash economy that\u2019s taking shape is emblematic of the changes in Russia, whose banks before the war were among Europe\u2019s leaders in providing digital services.

They&#39;re able to use the structure of the bridge as cover from artillery fire. Supply-wise, the Rus telegram states that high speed boats used for supplies are hard to stop over the 1km distance of the river, and that Russian forces asking to destroy the bridge have been denied so far due to &quot;infomation flow&quot;.

Only Britain and Eastern European countries have been fully 100% behind Ukraine and they range from having little else left to give to raiding their actual operational supplies while simultaneously continuing to cut their military budget (UK).\n\nThere's been constant speculation that if this summer's offensive fails to make substantial gains then support will start tailing off and major Western nations will start pushing Ukraine to make peace. Whether this happens is an entirely different matter but it's what Putin is relying on, as if Western support starts dropping then Russia will outproduce Ukraine (assuming Prigozhin was an isolated incident) as Ukraine's defence industry has been essentially destroyed and was smaller to start with.

And if the news isn't positive (like needing to retreat) they'll get less support. And less support means losing. I agree with the latter but not the former. The UA govt has the ability to greatly influence messaging and interpretation of events through probably the greatest information operations campaign since WW2. They've lost multiple battles in the war and it wasn't a big deal to their supporters or foreign support, thanks to their IO campaign. \n\nWhile I think politics is ultimately to blame for both high optempo and politically directed tactics, I think another major issue is military culture. \n\nTake a close look at the bios of the senior 3-4 star Ukrainian generals. They're pretty much all former Soviet Armed Forces officers, and that has an effect. Despite gungho their messaging about wanting to emulate NATO for half a decade (especially because saying that publicly helped unlock funding and weapons transfers), almost none of the top generals have any experience in their career working with western forces during various joint military operations like Kosovo, Iraq, or Afghanistan. Nor have most ever attended a single western military academy, war college, exchange program, large scale joint exercises, etc. Most of their military experience is from their outright Soviet days till 91, then their quasi Soviet days till the late 2010s. Their greatest achievements were as brigade command and higher since 2014, where they did the exact same thing they're doing now to keep their ragtag army fighting, just back then with almost no foreign military support until well into 2015. So how they view all things military and how westerners do will be very very different. \n\nLook at Colonel General Syrsky. Why isn't he a lieutenant general? Because he got that rank before that 2020 rebranding reform was even made. In terms of overall time in service, he's more senior than Zaluzhny. Srsky was already a 1 star general when the 2014 war started. He was a Russia born Soviet Ground Forces major who elected to stay in Ukraine after the USSR dissolved. Now he's the Ukrainian Ground Forces commander who's being used as a roving operational level commander similar to how Zhukov and other senior Red Army generals were used in WW2. There is nothing at all western about that guy, and yet he's got more influence on the bulk of Ukrainian forces than anyone in the country. Why would he make decisions based on Western ideals about training?",

If it&#39;s the US, there won&#39;t be anyone pressuring us. The whole of Russia will be a target not only for airstrikes but also invasions. </p>\n\n<p>Want to circumvent the Zaporizhzhia line? <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a6/6b/14/a66b14877e4536ff2f6bf97172ee4a15.png\">Pick a spot</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why Russia actually is terrified of Sweden and Finland joining NATO (and Ukraine for that matter).. It gives NATO that many more invasion fronts to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>Though at the end of the day, that&#39;s also why both sides regularly rattle nuclear sabers at each other.</p>\n</div>",

In the case of Russia, Putin allows opinions more nationalist than his, while quashing liberalizing forces with extreme prejudice.

Think about how Biden's approval ratings tanked when he left Afghanistan. They basically never recovered. And that was a deeply unpopular war that most people agreed with ending. Russia extricating itself from Ukraine would be a thousand times worse. The public hates losing, and they hate losers.
