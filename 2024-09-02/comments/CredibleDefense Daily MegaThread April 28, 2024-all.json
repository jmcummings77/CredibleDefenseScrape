As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The Times newspaper published this article on 23rd April: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/terminal-chechen-leader-posts-gym-video-as-succession-talk-mounts-bxbchzkw6\n\n\"Medical sources cited by Novaya Gazeta Europe said that Kadyrov, 47, was diagnosed with acute pancreatic necrosis in 2019\u00a0but that his condition had deteriorated sharply in recent months. He is believed to have developed severe kidney failure and fluid build-up in his lungs.\n\n...\n\nSpeculation about Kadyrov\u2019s health mounted in February when he failed to attend Putin\u2019s state of the nation address in Moscow, one of the most important events in the Russian political calendar.\n\n...\n\nA medical source at Moscow\u2019s Central Clinic Hospital, where Russian officials are treated, also told Novaya Gazeta Europe that an MRI scan in September had revealed that Kadyrov was suffering from an unspecified new health condition. Another source, this one close to a prominent Chechen MP, said that Kadyrov\u2019s family believed there was little chance of a positive outcome. The source paraphrased the family\u2019s reaction to the results of the MRI scan as: \u201cThe leader as we knew him will be gone; [the new] illness will have a serious effect on him. Even if he recovers right now, he\u2019ll no longer be alive or dead.\u201d\n\nMark Galleotti has also written an article about Kadyrov in today's Sunday Times. He doesn't address the credibility of the claims, but discusses the impacts of Kadyrov's potential demise on the Kremlin\"\n\n\n\"Considering the other crises on his desk, Putin will try to arrange a smooth succession. Kadyrov, who succeeded his father, hoped to build a dynasty, elevating his oldest son, Akhmat. However, he is just 18 \u2014 even though this did not stop his father appointing him Chechnya\u2019s minister for sport and youth \u2014 and the law stipulates that the head of the Chechen Republic must be at least 30.\n\nInstead, the front-runner seems to be Major General Apti Alaudinov, commander of the Chechen Akhmat mercenary units in Ukraine. Moscow regards him as someone with whom it can do business, but there are others closer to Kadyrov who may consider themselves to have a greater claim. Kadyrov\u2019s cousin Adam Delimkhanov, for example, has since 2007 been Chechnya\u2019s representative to the Duma, the Russian parliament, and has his own military forces.\n\n...\n\n\"If attempts to install a new leader cause splits in the Chechen elite, then this is likely to become not just a political but an armed dispute. In the words of one Russian political commentator, \u201cThere are too many men with guns and grudges there to be able to assume that things won\u2019t turn bloody.\u201d\n\nThis could be another dilemma in a long series of dilemmas for Putin. Kadyrov has kept a lid on Chechnya through extreme repression. In Galeotti's words, stability in Chechnya was bought after the war through both massive federal subsidies \u2014 to buy off Kadyrov and the rest of the Chechen elite \u2014 and a balance of terror between rival armed camps, all of whom pledged loyalty to Kadyrov, but mistrust each other. What does Putin do if there is a bloody power struggle? Does he divert forces away from Ukraine to bring about stability? Looks like more crisis management on the horizon for Vlad.",

Conversely, similar decrees in Russia are classified and not made public.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Ukraine hosts several significant projects dedicated to memorializing its fallen soldiers, such as the \u201cBook of Memory\u201d and the \u201cMemorial\u201d platform, contributing to a more comprehensive public record.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Authorities in various Ukrainian regions maintain detailed projects about fallen locals, with local publications often posting comprehensive lists.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Ukrainian sources tend to provide more complete information. For instance, without referencing the Probate Registry, birth and death dates were found for 55% of people in the Russian context, compared to 75% in the UALosses database.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Russian local authorities face restrictions on disclosing detailed information about the fallen. Additionally, one of the main sources for such entries, personal posts on VK social network, often lack detail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The main point in comparing the two was to refute Zelensky&#39;s 5:1 claim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a February 23 interview with Fox News, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested a casualty ratio of five Russians for every Ukrainian soldier killed. Even with the assumption that the UALosses database comprehensively lists all Ukrainian casualties\u2014unlikely\u2014and comparing it with the estimated 75,000 Russian fatalities against Ukraine\u2019s 42,000, the derived ratio is approximately 1.7.</p>\n\n<p>The phrasing of the comparison between the RAF and AFU in the penultimate passage has been amended to more accurately reflect the \u201cmany times over\u201d (\u00ab\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u00bb) nuance from the Russian original, as opposed to the broader interpretation used in the earlier version.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, there&#39;s too many methodological differences to look too deeply at the ratio imo, it&#39;s simply saying the ratio is unlikely to be particularly lopsided.</p>\n</div>",

Both from a man power perspective (forced recruits vs volunteers) and from a cadre perspective (the Ukrainian army was incapable of mounting any serious coordinated actions as far back as last summer, when they did their offensive. Not so for the Russians. This ties in to the fact that Russia simply has a lot more officers.)\n\nI've been following this sub for a while and right before the summer offensive there was a user here posting that, if you actually look at the Ukrainian army, they're turning in to a militia with Bradleys (bar a couple of good brigades).

This has been reiterated by different Russian sources - any French troops would be the number 1 target.</p>\n\n<p>What Macron is actually doing is posturing for a better position in the EU defense network (read - contracts for made in France/EU defense companies) in the wake of USA uncertainty.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If Odessa or Kiev were threatened, then I&#39;m confident that Ukraine would mobilize even 18-year old men since the existence of the state would be at risk.</em>\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trouble is, there aren&#39;t many of them and if it gets to that it&#39;s to late.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to notice here is that Ukrainian army is getting progressively worse at a faster pace than the Russian one. Both from a man power perspective (forced recruits vs volunteers) and from a cadre perspective (the Ukrainian army was incapable of mounting any serious coordinated actions as far back as last summer, when they did their offensive. Not so for the Russians. This ties in to the fact that Russia simply has a lot more officers.)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been following this sub for a while and right before the summer offensive there was a user here posting that, if you actually look at the Ukrainian army, they&#39;re turning in to a militia with Bradleys (bar a couple of good brigades). He was of course downvoted to hell and back but the complete failure of the summer offensive from a organizational POW proved him pretty much right.</p>\n</div>",

EOS is now working with the Ukrainian end-users and customers to allow committed orders to be placed under the conditional contracts. Further demonstration testing is planned to occur in Ukraine during 2024. These contracts are also subject to early termination rights in favour of the customer. There is no certainty or guarantee that committed orders will be received by EOS under these conditional contracts. \n\n> In July 2023, the Group delivered RWS to a Western European government customer, under a contract valued at EUR 32m (A$52m).

Defence Systems launched its new \u201cSlinger\u201d counter-drone (or \u201cCUAS\u201d, Counter Unmanned Aerial System) product during May 2023, and conducted demonstrations. This new product draws upon the Group\u2019s deep expertise in accurate pointing technology and applies it to the growing threat of drones. During 2023, initial orders for nine systems were received from a customer in the United States. These are expected to be sent to Ukraine as part of a USA security assistance package. In addition, after the end of the year, a further $15m of Slinger systems were ordered by a customer in Germany in January 2024. \n\n> \u2022 R150 RWS.
