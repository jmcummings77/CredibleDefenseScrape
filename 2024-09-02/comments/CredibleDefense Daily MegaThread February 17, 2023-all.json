It would make me so happy if someone made a ChatGPT app that converts anything in free text that could be a table into a table. But until that happy day here's my manual version of the article's content:\n\n| **Class** | **Training Start Date** | **Completion Date** | **Total Number of Soldiers** |\n|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| 1         | Jan 15                  | Feb 17              | 635                          |\n| 2         | Feb 03                  | Mar 10*             | 710                          |\n| 3         | Feb 20                  | Mar 25*             | 890                          |\n|           |                         | Total:              | 2235                         |\n                            \n \\* *estimated, probably +/-3 days because it took the first class 32 days, but the article describes the training as \"five weeks\" long* \n\n| **Vehicle Types**                               | **Standard Crew Per Vehicle** | **Number of Vehicles** | **Total** |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| M109A Paladin + Bradley IFV                       | 6 + 10                          | 7 + 60                   | 42 + 593  = 635  |\n| M109A Paladin + Bradley IFV                       | 6 + 10                          | 7 + 67                   | 42 + 668  = 710  |\n| M109A Paladin + Stryker AFV/APC/ICV/WTHever it is | 6 + 11                          | 8 + 77                   | 48 + 842 = 890    |\n|                                                 |                               |                        | 132 + 2103 = 2235  |\n\nI got to this in a convoluted way that was annoying to convert to markdown, but basically I assumed:\n\n1. They are training a single unit here. This makes sense given how well the units match up to the standard Ukrainian mechanized brigade formation. That formation has served them well, and includes some of their most effective and seemingly ubiquitous units, like the 72nd Mechanized Brigade.  It also makes sense given the training schedule (more on that below).\n2. The Ukrainians are currently receiving the 22 Paladins donated by the UK, which were likely the ones the were spotted rolling off the ARC Integrity a few days ago after it rather noticeably arrived in Ukraine with many more vehicles than it had on board when it left the US before stopping in the UK and then offloading in Belgium. \n3. They are training on those Paladins alone. I believe some donated by Norway (?) have already made it to the battlefield, but otherwise only the British M109A4s have been delivered. And as mentioned above those vehicles could very conveniently have been delivered literally within the last few weeks. In any case, that implies 42 soldiers would be assigned to Paladins in each class, with an extra Paladin and its six crew assigned to one class (since 22 is not cleanly divisible by three). I put it at the end above out of pure laziness.\n4. The remaining soliders of any given training class (593 for class 1, 668 for class 2, 842 for class 3) were assigned to the other IFV/AFV type going through the course in the same class. \n5. That remainder divided by the standard crew complement for that vehicle type gives us a vehicle count. \n6. There is some amount of under manning or deviation in crew numbers per vehicle, so decimal vehicle counts are rounded up, e.g. in class 1, 593/10 == 59.3, not 60. \n\n \nI'm guessing the second class is slightly larger than the first because it contains the brigade HQ elements, which makes sense based on how they've scheduled overlaps for cross training between battalions. The schedule has the first, smaller Bradley battalion overlapping with one artillery battalion and then the larger Bradley battalion and a second artillery battalion. Next, the second, larger Bradley battalion is overlapping with the previous class and with the third and final class. So the second battalion cross trained or will cross train with each of the other units, each of whom won't necessarily train with all of each other during this course. But everyone gets the opportunity for at least some cross training, and some with their command. \n\nSo that adds up to about one standard UAF mechanized brigade, minus the elements that probably aren't coming directly from western donors right this second, like T variant tanks for the tank battalion. UAF mechanized brigades usually have three or four mechanized battalions and maybe a motorized or reserve battalion ([e.g., the 72nd MBr on militaryland.net](https://militaryland.net/ukraine/armed-forces/72nd-mechanized-brigade/)). And usually the brigade artillery groups have two battalions of SPGs, which makes this group a little heavy on SPGs, but that seems like a logical decision for an offensive unit in this war, where artillery superiority is so critical. Or it's constrained by the training pipeline somehow. So that just leaves the (presumably T variant) tank battalion, the rest of the artillery group (HQ, rocket artillery, etc.), air defense battalion, any recon or engineering units, and the various rear echelon support battalions. \n\nAnd they are all set to come online by the end of March, right before the mud season starts to wind down. It'll probably be short this year, because there won't be much snow melt after the unseasonably warm winter they've had so far.",

        "body": "Since a lot of discussion here has been looking towards what the next year of the way would look like, I wanted to get an idea of the timing of committed equipment deliveries to Ukraine. Considering tanks have been the most examined, I looked at them first.\n\n**90 T-72EAs** (120 possible) - purchased by Netherlands and US from Czech Republic; possibly five a week starting December 12, 2022. \n\nhttps://archive.is/u5JkH\n\n>One of the African client countries of the Excalibur Army Czech defense company has agreed to donate its T-72s, which were transferred to the Czech Republic for repair, as a \"form of support for Ukraine\".\n\n>This made it possible to increase the number of vehicles that the Czechs could modernize for the Armed Forces of Ukraine by order of the governments of the USA and the Netherlands: 90 tanks in the basic package and additional 30 tanks in the option, Novinky.cz reports.\n\n>But instead, the Czech company described the speed of production: every four days one restored and modernized tank leaves their workshops, and every 4 days Excalibur Army receives 1 more tank from warehouses for modernization.\n\n>To be more specific, the Czechs need an average of 66 working days to restore one T-72, only 15% of the necessary components are not domestic, the other 85% of components are restored by Excalibur Army specialists themselves.\n\nhttps://archive.is/IEktI (archived page using Google translate) - article dated December 5th\n\n>\"Next week, the first five units of tanks for Ukraine will be received, we would like to deliver 18 units by the end of the year,\" noted Kub\u011bna. They would like to deliver a total of 90 tanks to Ukraine, or another 30, for which Ukraine has an option, next year.\n\n**14 Challenger 2s** - by end of March\n\nhttps://archive.is/CRGHi\n\n>Britain hopes the Challenger 2 tanks it is supplying to Ukraine will arrive in the country at the end of March, defence department minister Alex Chalk said on Thursday.\n\n**30 PT-91s & 30 Polish T-72s** - no date given but said ready to send now so probably short term. \n\nhttps://archive.is/ErUXQ\n\n>Poland sent 250 tanks as the first country half a year ago or even more than that. Right now, we are ready to send 60 of our modernized tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession\n\n**Abrams** - late this year, early next year \n\nhttps://archive.is/V363U \n\n>The 31 M1A2 main battle tanks that Biden officially authorized on Tuesday would not be taken from U.S. military stockpiles, but would be procured under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. They would be built to task, without the depleted uranium armor, for delivery late this year or next.\n\n**14 Leopard 2A6s** - Germany - end of March\n\nhttps://archive.is/uD5dO\n\n>Chancellor Olaf Scholz came in for criticism in recent months from EU partners for his apparent hesitation to supply Ukraine with battle tanks. On Jan. 25, he announced that Germany would send 14 state-of-the-art Leopard 2 A6s as part of a coordinated effort to provide two full battalions. They are expected to be shipped at the end of March.\n\n**14 Leopard 2A4s** - Poland - Late April\n\nhttps://archive.is/QaANc\n\n>On Friday, Polish Deputy Defence Minister Marcin Ociepa told private broadcaster RMF FM that it would be around three months before Leopard tanks reached Ukraine.\n\n>\"It depends what country we are talking about, but I would estimate that we are talking about around a quarter... until those tanks can really be on Ukrainian territory and go into battle,\" he said.\n\nFrom https://archive.is/uD5dO\n\n>Poland has said it will deliver an older version of the tank, the A4, but will need spare parts from Germany. Those parts, however, are no longer in production.\n\n**8 Leopard 2A4s** - Norway - No time frame given\n\nhttps://archive.is/9vcoH \n\n>Norway will donate 8 tanks and up to 4 special purpose tanks to Ukraine.

I'm not enough of a kremlinologist to say whether that is a fair assessment of Putin, but there have been repeated reports of him insisting on objectives being met by certain specific special dates like May 9th. Back before that date, the rumors were that he had ordered the complete capture of Donestk and Luhansk Oblasts before the May Day parade. Nothing came of it, but not because Putin didn't issue the orders, but rather because the orders were impossible to achieve. \n\nHowever, at the time, understanding Putin's orders and motivations helped explain why the Russians redeployed their badly mauled troops from the Kyiv offensive to Izyum without any operational pause. Which in turn is significant because it demonstrates the fundamental dysfunction of the Russian state, where subjective and arbitrary political concerns override objective military necessity because Putin is micromanaging the war effort. So it's definitely worth considering what is on Putin's mind to at least contextualize Russian operational decision making.",

He mentioned in his observation that Ukrainian and Russian tank battles are within 200 to 1,000 meters, which in his opinion was very close and said he was hitting car sized targets at over 3,800 meters with the Leopards and the tank was moving at full speed over rough terrain.

        "body": "Good article on KMW and Leopard 2 production. Original in German. I'll copy-paste a Google translated version below.\n\nhttps://www.rnd.de/politik/panzerbauer-kmw-haelt-deutliche-ausweitung-der-produktion-fuer-machbar-2LUNYVENYLFECN2OU42EZBV6R4.html\n\n**Tank manufacturer KMW considers a significant increase in production to be feasible**\n\n Politicians are struggling with a clear consensus on arms production.  Everything is actually ready, says a leading armaments manager, and he names the general conditions.  Is politics getting in the way?\n\nThe tank builder Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) sees no industrial obstacles to a significant increase in production.  His company is constantly asking all subcontractors what production rates are possible, said KMW boss Ralf Ketzel of the German Press Agency in Berlin.  \"So far, no one has given us a signal like 'that's not possible',\" he said.  \"What we need for this is a clear political consensus.\"\n\nAlmost a year after the start of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the capacities and capabilities of Western armaments companies will also be a topic at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) for the foreseeable future until Sunday.  Meanwhile, criticism from the German armaments industry is becoming ever clearer that, despite all the political declarations, hardly any orders have been received so far.\n\n*Produced about 300 tanks annually during the Cold War*\n\nKMW is a manufacturer of weapon systems such as the Leopard 2 battle tank and the Panzerhaubitze 2000. With more than 4000 employees, the company describes itself as the market leader for highly protected wheeled and tracked vehicles in Europe.\n\nDuring the Cold War, KMW had produced about 300 Leopard tanks a year, which is about one per working day.  After that, the business model changed.  Most recently, there was a new build program in the order of 50 Leopard tanks per year.  There is also an upgrade program in which 60 or 70 vehicles per year are brought up to date.  About 50 other vehicles come for repairs, i.e. for repairs and maintenance.\n\n \u201cIf you want to start producing 300 vehicles a year again, we have a few issues that need to be considered.  For example, today's vehicles are more complex because they consist of many more parts.  In addition, we would hand over certain tasks that we now do in the main plant to subsidiaries or partner companies,\" said Ketzel.  \"We also have enough room to get back into such a production relatively quickly, if it is really wanted.\"\n\nWhen he came to the company himself, there was basically an assembly line, \"not a single repair, not a single conversion,\" he recalls.  Ketzel: \u201cOnly series production of the Leopard took place.  Since then, however, we have not reduced the infrastructure, but have grown larger.  We have built three halls.  That gives us room to breathe.\u201d KMW is well utilized with repair and conversion orders.\n\n *Production of 500 to 600 Leopard 2 possible*\n\nAccording to figures that were collected in Europe before the Ukraine war and with the replacement of the vehicles that have now been handed over, production will reach 500 to 600 Leopard 2, according to the KMW boss.  If this is not required in an extremely short period of time, it is possible with the current infrastructure in Europe and with the current production lines.\n\n\u201cWe have a lead time of one year before assembly and integration begin.  This means that the large sub-suppliers who produce motors, optronics, electronics or special optics are called upon immediately,\u201d said Ketzel.  \u201cSome have no problem with it at all because they already have a larger production line for many systems.  Sometimes, however, even small issues trigger headaches.  This can be a chip, for example.\u201d\n\nHe estimates one to two years for the start-up of a co-production - whether as an additional production line abroad or in Germany.  However, the subcontractors also need a lead time.  Ketzel: \u201cIf we have an order now, we can ensure that the first systems will be delivered in two years.  In three years it will go up.  How steep this curve becomes depends on the parameters.  We may be able to build two lines, but we cannot build five.\u201d\n\n Almost a year after the Zeitenwende, the federal government and the procurement department of the Bundeswehr have not yet placed any orders for the large weapon systems.  When asked whether the starting signal has already been given for ramping up production, Ketzel replies: \"No.  We are in talks with the (procurement office) BAAINBw for many contracts.  From our point of view, they are on the right track.  But we're not talking about three-digit numbers.\"\n\n A clear political consensus as a basis for decision-making could also be a \u201ccertain target configuration\u201d, which should be achieved in four years.  \u201cA prominent example is the Puma infantry fighting vehicle: There was a clear statement that a division would be needed in 2027.  That's why we invested.  The British are a good example.  They say they want 500 Boxer wheeled armored vehicles for ten years.  It is working.\"\n\n*Production is subject to the Weapons Control Act*\n\nKetzel emphasizes that KMW - unlike automobile manufacturers or computer manufacturers - does not operate freely on the market.  \u201cEverything is subject to the War Weapons Control Act.  That is put simply.  First of all, the manufacture of war weapons is forbidden, and then there are exemptions.  If we want to start manufacturing a weapon of war, we need a license to do it,\u201d he says.  \u201cThat is German law and it will not change.  That's reasonable too.  We are a regulated industry.\u201d\n\nThe tank builder, which has its headquarters in Munich and several branches in Germany and overseas, observes the course of the battles in the Ukraine and draws conclusions for its own concepts in the construction of weapon systems.  Even the historic Crimean War \"foreshadowed the First World War\".  \"Today we see a lot - and maybe even understand it - that will change our image of combat leadership,\" says Ketzel.\n\n The question is whether in the future it will still be possible to live with \"tent city-like command posts\" or whether complex decision-making processes will have to be organized in staff units.  \u201cYou can feel from the Ukraine that things work completely differently, more like a network with good communication.  We experience ad hoc decisions that are not planned as well as we know it with maps and situation reports and reports.  Our world and its nervous systems often work the other way around.  They react to impulses, to blocks of information and not to presentations.\u201d\n\nThe question of how large, how light and how networked the main battle tank can be in the future is also of concern.  \u201cWe saw that in the marine sector.  At some point people said: cruisers or battleships are too big,\u201d says Ketzel.  \u201cBut there are still ships, including large ships, but no longer battleships.  Today there are aircraft carriers.\u201d",

First, technically the airborne radar makes sense, but becomes less than necessary if the plan is for complete ground vectoring of each fighter aircraft, as was the norm with the MiG-21. They might receive guidance such as, \"Turn right to 320\u00ba and descend to 5,000 meters and accelerate.\" Given those instructions the MiG-21 doesn't need the penalty weight of an airborne radar interception. Second, they had such a small fuel fraction that errors could cause them to abort the run and return to base. Third, the hard part of designing a jet fighter is the engine, and it takes much longer to do so - perhaps 10 years; if the current engine were designed for a MiG-21-weight aircraft, then you might well be stuck with a MiG-21. Finally, IIRC USAF fighters (mostly?) had to confirm ID visually, which means there's less opportunity to gain an advantage using Beyond Visual Range radar missiles. (Not sure about Navy Rules of Engagement.)",

But in March, Vladimir Kozhin, presidential aide on military and technical cooperation, said that Moscow did not see any obstacles for possible deliveries of SAMs to Turkey because of its membership in NATO. Mr. Kozhin emphasized that the supply contract is very strictly regulated and each party assumes the obligations regarding what it has the right to do with the supplied weapon and what it does not.\n> \n> \n> Turkey's membership in NATO is one of the main reasons why the country will not receive full access to the systems, says Sergei Denisentsev, an expert at the Center for Analysis, Strategy and Technology:\n> \n> \n> \"One has to understand that the 'friend-or-foe' system used in Russia is different from the one used in NATO countries. The need to exclude the copying of the signals of the \"friend-or-foe\" system is very important to eliminate the possibility of this system being used by the enemy in case of any conflict.\"\n> \n> \n> Turkey had earlier planned to buy an SAM from China for $4 billion, but the deal did not take place at NATO's request. The amount Ankara will pay for the Triumphs has not been named, but, according to Kommersant, the possible value of the contract with Russia is more than $2 billion for four S-400 battalions.  \n\nkommersant.ru/doc/3427691",

All the other systems that we used to export were worse than the ones that were supplied to the Russian army&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Western media had earlier claimed that Turkey would refuse to buy S-400 because of possible difficulties with the interaction of the systems with NATO radars. But in March, Vladimir Kozhin, presidential aide on military and technical cooperation, said that Moscow did not see any obstacles for possible deliveries of SAMs to Turkey because of its membership in NATO. Mr. Kozhin emphasized that the supply contract is very strictly regulated and each party assumes the obligations regarding what it has the right to do with the supplied weapon and what it does not.</p>\n\n<p>Turkey&#39;s membership in NATO is one of the main reasons why the country will not receive full access to the systems, says Sergei Denisentsev, an expert at the Center for Analysis, Strategy and Technology:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;One has to understand that the &#39;friend-or-foe&#39; system used in Russia is different from the one used in NATO countries. The need to exclude the copying of the signals of the &quot;friend-or-foe&quot; system is very important to eliminate the possibility of this system being used by the enemy in case of any conflict.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Turkey had earlier planned to buy an SAM from China for $4 billion, but the deal did not take place at NATO&#39;s request. The amount Ankara will pay for the Triumphs has not been named, but, according to Kommersant, the possible value of the contract with Russia is more than $2 billion for four S-400 battalions.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>kommersant.ru/doc/3427691</p>\n</div>",

Sometimes tanks don't operate with the full 3 men crew in war due to earlier losses. It's even worse for APC's, IFV's and buildings hit. The number of KIA is extremely hard to estimate accurately. \n\nThen, even if hits are filmed, or seen directly, the outcome is many times uncertain. You shoot a guy, he seems to fall. Is he dead? Is he wounded? Or was it quick reaction. He seems to drop after a drone dropped a grenade, but perhaps he's just playing dead. Maybe he's knocked out. \n\nThat's before we even get into transferring the reports of individual units all the way up the command chain. Double counts (either through misunderstanding or two units reporting the same kill), \"rounding\" in reporting and such inflate the numbers naturally. It's very hard to overcome the inherent bias to round up.\n\nHell there are instances of double count in the same unit, two or three people shooting at the same enemy soldier. At the end of the day, all 2-3 claim a confirmed kill.\n\n>All that to say, it would be a wild exception if the UA numbers are not 30-50% inflated over reality.",

            "body": ">If Russia collapsed with many different factions, groups or ethnic groups all just fighting everything out\n\n70% of the country is ethnically Russian. The next largest group are the Tartars at 3%.
