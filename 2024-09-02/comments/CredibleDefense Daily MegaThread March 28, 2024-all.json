Russia\u2019s Federal Air Transport Agency didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n>Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has introduced new laws that allow Russian companies to perform heavy maintenance on their aircraft, manufacture their own components and cannibalize parked aircraft for replacement parts. Regular maintenance intervals have also been prolonged or deferred. \n\n>Those measures haven\u2019t been approved by Western manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus, or by the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency.\n\n> Not all of the safety incidents recorded last year can be linked to sanctions. The Jacdec data include the downing of the jet that carried Yevgeny Prigozhin, the then-leader of the Wagner paramilitary group, for example. The data also capture bird strikes and an incident when an aircraft abandoned its approach because a dog found its way onto the runway.\n\n>But the data include many incidents that experts say are likely linked to sanctions.

They also say a lack of technological know-how in welding tires when repairing wheels and separate issues with low-quality deicing chemicals have led to safety incidents. Meanwhile, a shortage of parts for simulators has raised concerns about Russia\u2019s ability to train new pilots and run required refresher courses.\n\n>After losing access to Western manuals needed to conduct inspections, some Russian airline engineers have developed their own repair and maintenance programs, Laneckij said.\n\u201cThese improvised approaches raise concerns about potential consequences and safety implications,\u201d Laneckij said.\n\n> \u201cOne solution is to move away from Western-built aircraft to domestic ones, but when will we see that?

This is their shtick, their 'information warfare' style. Remember how, in the span of a single year, they've tried to accuse Ukraine of actually instigating the conflict (turned out it was a false flag), hosting bioweapon laboratories (turns out they were normal medical laboratories), planning dirty bomb attacks (IAEA had in general wasted plenty of time in the first year of this war)? Add to that some of the 'grassroots' accusations (I guess ultimately they were just *too* dumb to put an official seal of approval on them) like the Mutant Soldiers, Killer Mosquitos and Black Magic and you get a nice collection of nothing that they can parrot back as necessary. I've honestly forgotten half of the sh\\*t they had slung, and that's part of the reason it's working - there's no hard consequences for any of that, *something* **will** stick, people will forget the rest and won't bother scouring the 'archives' for obvious bulls\\*it, so why not do it?\n\nAs a somewhat relevant point, I'm always amused by their insistence that Poland is actively planning to take over parts of Ukrainian territory and that 'any second' the masks will fall off and Poles will pour over the border not as assistance, but to steal their land (yet, also according to them, the Poles are apparently leading in the number of mercenaries present in Ukraine).\n\nOf course, none of this helps their relations with USA / Europe or them being on Ukraine's side, but they believe they can outlast that opposition. If they do, none of these lies actually being lies would matter to them, as they would have successfully countered 'The West' and asserted their power.\n\nUltimately, it seems like a big and scandalous accusation *now*, but try to imagine looking back on it in a year's time. It'll be just another lie in a string of obvious lies from Russia. Sure, it's quite a bit more daring, but I can easily see it blending with the rest as time passes.",

To ensure this process we need people. That is why I would like every person of military age in Ukraine to realize that it depends on his will and actions for Ukraine to survive.\n\u2022\t\u2060Ukrainians continue to defend their country, in particular when returning from abroad. We have a lot of volunteers, and this is not an exaggeration. I am not saying that there are no problems, but I emphasize that we are doing everything to solve them.\n\u2022\t\u2060We are currently reviewing the strength of certain units not participating in combat operations based on an audit of their activities. This allowed us to release thousands of troops and send them to combat units.\n\u2022\t\u2060We withdrew our forces from Avdiivka because the enemy had a significant advantage in the forces and means of assault units. Due to constant bombardment by guided aerial bombs, the integrity of our defenses was compromised, which allowed the enemy to gradually advance forward. The insufficient amount of ammunition for our artillery also played a negative role. This did not allow effective counter-battery warfare under such conditions. To avoid encirclement and save people\u2019s lives, I decided to leave Avdiivka.\n\u2022\t\u2060We cannot ignore any information about the enemy's preparation for offensive actions, so we are taking all measures to adequately respond to such a possibility. Today we are carrying out a large complex of works on fortification equipment of territories and positions.  We already have experience in combat operations in the Kharkiv region, we managed to \u201ccalculate\u201d the enemy and liberate a significant part of the Kharkiv region. At this time, a large-scale collapse of the Russian front occurred. If the Russians go there again, Kharkiv will become a fatal city for them.\n\u2022\t\u2060We are very grateful to our Western allies, NATO countries, the European Union and other partners for their support. Without such support, without the supply of weapons, ammunition, air defense systems, and heavy equipment, it would be much more difficult for us to fight an insidious and powerful enemy. The latest case is Avdeevka. We would, of course, maintain these positions if we had a sufficient number, first of all, of air defense systems and artillery shells. This is not a complaint, but a statement of fact.\n\u2022\t\u2060We can mention the rearmament of artillery units with the domestic 155-mm Bogdan cannon, while simultaneously equipping it with an automatic fire guidance system. Soon, we can expect that some samples of Western howitzers and domestic rifled mortars will be produced in Ukraine. Another good example is the restoration and overhaul of American-made M777 howitzers. We have established production of some of these parts here in Ukraine. In particular, when restoring each unit of this howitzer, 40 percent of the parts and spare parts manufactured for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at domestic enterprises are used.\n\nhttps://x.com/wartranslated/status/1773634829965299826?s=46",

                "body": "The Oil Campaign was a bit of a mixed bag, the bombing of oil infrastructure in Romania wasn't all that effective, but the bombing of the synthetic oil infrastructure in Germany crippled the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe by 45. The German Synthetic Oil infrastructure was much more vulnerable than regular oil infrastructure as they had four major inputs that they needed vast amounts of to work: coal gas, power, air, and water. This meant that there were kilometers of vulnerable pipes and conduits which were all susceptible to Allied bombing, and annoyingly time consuming to repair. By the time a plant was brought back up to partial production, the Allies simply bombed them again. \n\nWorst of all for the Germans, even when they attempted to split their synthetic oil production and decentralize like they did their ball bearings and aircraft production, they found out that synthetic oil required vast and complex structures to function. By the end of the war, the Germans were trying to build underground facilities, but by then the Allied transportation campaign had completely crippled the German economy, and progress was stalled. \n\nAlso, I would take the statements of the former Nazi officials with a grain of salt - they tended to exaggerate and try to praise the Americans and British, likely out of self preservation. For example, Albert Speer said that if the Allies had committed to bombing the synthetic oil refineries non-stop, the Nazis would have capitulated in eight weeks - a claim which beggars belief, considering how the Nazis would hold on even after the more effective Transportation Campaign had completely hollowed out the German economy. \n\nI would instead point towards the civilian led WW2 US Strategic Bombing Survey (European War) for a more accurate impression of the true effectiveness of the European Strategic Bombing Campaign. The survey leaders were also not ordinary officers, but hand-picked reputable professionals: engineers, scientists, economists, lawyers, psychologists, statisticians, and managers. To get the most accurate information for the survey, the US Army sent GIs deep into the dying Reich, including some combat zones where they would get shot at regularly, to investigate the results of bombing and scour for industrial documents. The survey leaders would interrogate and question hundreds of former slave laborers, Nazi ministry members, and German industrialists to get a top to bottom view of the effects of the strategic bombing campaign.\n\nThe US Strategic Bombing Survey was a remarkable effort, largely divorced from the Air Force generals who were devotees of the idea that Strategic Bombing alone would end wars, it is a sober and surprisingly self critical examination of how effective the various parts of the Strategic Bombing Campaign was.\n\nThe quick rundown of the conclusions:\n\n* Bombing Ball Bearing Factories was ineffective once the Germans adjusted.\n\n* Bombing Aircraft Factories was ineffective once the Germans adjusted.\n\n* Bombing Romanian Oil Refineries was mostly ineffective. Soviet Ground invasion was necessary to knock them out of the war.\n\n* Bombing German Synthetic Oil Production was very effective, despite herculean efforts by the Germans to repair them. Also had secondary effects of crippling production of explosives, industrial chemicals, and lubricants.\n\n* Bombing German Steel Production was of mediocre effectiveness. Production was crippled by secondary effects of destroying transportation and utilities, but Germany never had an acute steel shortage throughout the war.\n\n* Bombing German Transportation (Railways and Waterways), killed the German economy. Transportation of coal became extremely difficult, and Germany ran on coal. Secondary effects of coal shortage crippled all the major German industries. \n\n* Bombing German electrical production was a major missed opportunity. The German Power situation was precarious at the start of the war, and got worse as the war went on. The German electric power infrastructure was extremely vulnerable, but despite this, outside of a few minor raids, the Allies did nothing to target them directly.\n\n* Bombing of Civilians - The survey does not make any conclusions (likely as civilian populations were never an explicit target of the USAAF in Europe, officially) , but notes that even with worsening morale and deteriorating faith in their leaders, the German civilians continued to work efficiently until the end.\n\nWhile I would caution drawing a 1 to 1 comparison to WW2, I would imagine if the Russians have the will and resources necessary to repair their oil infrastructure, they will likely be able to do it much like the Germans were able to do. That being said, this isn't the 1940s, refineries have gotten more complicated and require higher-tech components to operate effectively, and weaponry has improved dramatically since the 1940s, especially in terms of accuracy. Also, it is important to note that the Ukrainians don't seem to be aiming at killing Russian oil production completely like the Americans and British were against the Germans, but rather force the Russians to either expend their resources on guarding their refineries, or take the nasty hits onto their income and strain their war economy. \n\n\nSources:\n\n1.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The Oil Campaign was a bit of a mixed bag, the bombing of oil infrastructure in Romania wasn&#39;t all that effective, but the bombing of the synthetic oil infrastructure in Germany crippled the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe by 45. The German Synthetic Oil infrastructure was much more vulnerable than regular oil infrastructure as they had four major inputs that they needed vast amounts of to work: coal gas, power, air, and water. This meant that there were kilometers of vulnerable pipes and conduits which were all susceptible to Allied bombing, and annoyingly time consuming to repair. By the time a plant was brought back up to partial production, the Allies simply bombed them again. </p>\n\n<p>Worst of all for the Germans, even when they attempted to split their synthetic oil production and decentralize like they did their ball bearings and aircraft production, they found out that synthetic oil required vast and complex structures to function. By the end of the war, the Germans were trying to build underground facilities, but by then the Allied transportation campaign had completely crippled the German economy, and progress was stalled. </p>\n\n<p>Also, I would take the statements of the former Nazi officials with a grain of salt - they tended to exaggerate and try to praise the Americans and British, likely out of self preservation. For example, Albert Speer said that if the Allies had committed to bombing the synthetic oil refineries non-stop, the Nazis would have capitulated in eight weeks - a claim which beggars belief, considering how the Nazis would hold on even after the more effective Transportation Campaign had completely hollowed out the German economy. </p>\n\n<p>I would instead point towards the civilian led WW2 US Strategic Bombing Survey (European War) for a more accurate impression of the true effectiveness of the European Strategic Bombing Campaign. The survey leaders were also not ordinary officers, but hand-picked reputable professionals: engineers, scientists, economists, lawyers, psychologists, statisticians, and managers. To get the most accurate information for the survey, the US Army sent GIs deep into the dying Reich, including some combat zones where they would get shot at regularly, to investigate the results of bombing and scour for industrial documents. The survey leaders would interrogate and question hundreds of former slave laborers, Nazi ministry members, and German industrialists to get a top to bottom view of the effects of the strategic bombing campaign.</p>\n\n<p>The US Strategic Bombing Survey was a remarkable effort, largely divorced from the Air Force generals who were devotees of the idea that Strategic Bombing alone would end wars, it is a sober and surprisingly self critical examination of how effective the various parts of the Strategic Bombing Campaign was.</p>\n\n<p>The quick rundown of the conclusions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Bombing Ball Bearing Factories was ineffective once the Germans adjusted.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombing Aircraft Factories was ineffective once the Germans adjusted.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombing Romanian Oil Refineries was mostly ineffective. Soviet Ground invasion was necessary to knock them out of the war.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombing German Synthetic Oil Production was very effective, despite herculean efforts by the Germans to repair them. Also had secondary effects of crippling production of explosives, industrial chemicals, and lubricants.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombing German Steel Production was of mediocre effectiveness. Production was crippled by secondary effects of destroying transportation and utilities, but Germany never had an acute steel shortage throughout the war.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombing German Transportation (Railways and Waterways), killed the German economy. Transportation of coal became extremely difficult, and Germany ran on coal. Secondary effects of coal shortage crippled all the major German industries. </p></li>\n<li><p>Bombing German electrical production was a major missed opportunity. The German Power situation was precarious at the start of the war, and got worse as the war went on. The German electric power infrastructure was extremely vulnerable, but despite this, outside of a few minor raids, the Allies did nothing to target them directly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bombing of Civilians - The survey does not make any conclusions (likely as civilian populations were never an explicit target of the USAAF in Europe, officially) , but notes that even with worsening morale and deteriorating faith in their leaders, the German civilians continued to work efficiently until the end.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While I would caution drawing a 1 to 1 comparison to WW2, I would imagine if the Russians have the will and resources necessary to repair their oil infrastructure, they will likely be able to do it much like the Germans were able to do. That being said, this isn&#39;t the 1940s, refineries have gotten more complicated and require higher-tech components to operate effectively, and weaponry has improved dramatically since the 1940s, especially in terms of accuracy. Also, it is important to note that the Ukrainians don&#39;t seem to be aiming at killing Russian oil production completely like the Americans and British were against the Germans, but rather force the Russians to either expend their resources on guarding their refineries, or take the nasty hits onto their income and strain their war economy. </p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0020_SPANGRUD_STRATEGIC_BOMBING_SURVEYS.pdf\">US Strategic Bombing Survey</a> (Warning PDF)</li>\n<li>Masters of the air: America\u2019s bomber boys who fought the air war against Nazi germany.
