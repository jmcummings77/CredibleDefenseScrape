(I doubt it, but if Moldova gets some gurantee, they come some sort of an agreement, I just dont see what the hell Russia could do if Romania and Moldova decides to clean that place up. Of course that would be a great escalation is pretty much the only thing that is against it and that might very well be enough ...)</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

As a result they were grossly unprepared to stop incoming attacks. Once the invasion started, both Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts were taken in days with little to no resistance. Similarly, the Russians reached the Kyiv suburbs in a day, also not planned. Luckily the Russian advance was checked there, but mostly because the invasion was clown shoes retarded in every conceivable way; random platoons of TDF with NLAW or Javelin were not supposed to be the ones stopping Russian armored columns on the outskirts of Kyiv, that was what the active duty brigades of the UAF were for, but they weren't ready. Numerous cities NE of Kyiv were either partially or totally surrounded and only relieved later because the Russians abandoned that strategic front owning more to their own tactical, operational, and strategic incompetence than any UA strategic ability. \n\nIf anything, the phase 1 portion of this war was defined by UA strategic leadership being rescued by UA tactical ability, perseverance, and guts, while taking very heavy casualties along the way.\n\nSkip ahead to the Donbas salient campaign, and that really could have been done better. To start with, the strategic policies that forbid retreats without approval from Kyiv were a very bad idea, brass and politicians out of the loop over 700 km away from the fight were making tactical decisions that a colonel or major general should have been making on the spot. The policy of strategic micromanagement to favor rigidly holding ground at all costs, regardless of losses or the tactical nature of the ground, resulted in incredibly high UAF attrition, taking casualties they could not afford to take if they wanted to go on the offensive shortly afterwards. Especially since they lost half the ground they were trying to hold, hindsight it proved they screwed up.\n\nBut what really burns my ass were the 60-200 KIA a day for months, on top of what they took earlier in the war. That meant sending in troops that were barely trained to replace casualties that were themselves barely trained who replaced very well trained troops. Ukraine always wanted to go on the offensive to retake lost ground, all operations since April should have focused on preserving their force, to maintain quality as the Russians lost whatever was left of theirs. \n\nNot to mention issues regarding strategic, operational, and tactical economy of force, defined as \"use of all available combat power in the most effective way possible, in an attempt to allocate a minimum of essential combat power to any secondary efforts.\"\n\nThe UAF launched counteroffensives in Kharkiv and the Kherson bridgehead in late May. If they were doing that just as supporting operations to either pin Russian troops in place or force them to reinforce them, that would have been fine. But the UAF enlarged both to the point they are legit large scale operations that are competing with what was clearly the Ukraine strategic main effort in the Donbas salient from April to now. \n\nEven within the Donbas operational area they were counterattacking Izyum, which would have been a good spoiling attack if they didn't keep it going for nearly two months, committing a really good mech brigade to unsuccessfully attack a sector that would otherwise have been quiet. Did that divert Russian troops? Yes, but like the counteroffensives it wasn't enough to stop the Russians from achieving a large scale operational victory taking the Donets river defensive line when Lysychansk was outflanked.\n\nI'm hoping they fight better in the future. I'm hoping they have secretly built up a large reserve of well trained and equipped units who have been hidden in the strategic reserve for the last months.

What happened when they lost it later on?  \n\nThe retreat from Poprasna turned into a breakout because the defenses behind it weren't fully manned, so when the Russians bumrushed it after the withdrawal from the city they were able to break through. Why weren't they manned already with a second line to allow a passage of lines as a proper defense in depth is supposed to occur? Because they didn't have the manpower. Where was the manpower? Being used to feed the meat grinder in other sectors. \n\n>Suddenly the defenses of the southern front were unhinged and they started losing ground all across that area, which allowed Russia to get close enough to severely threaten their supply lines to Lysychansk.\n\nThe south flank of the Donets defensive line, specifically Lysychansk, was unhinged due to two Russian axes of advance. The Popasna axis, which as I mentioned I dont think would have been broken through had they not robbed Peter to pay Paul, and the Nyzhnje-Toshkivka axis, which was the same issue as Popasna, too lightly defended because UAF weren't focused on it, and then that turned into big gains that led to the Zolote pocket and the total undermining of the Lysychansk line on the Donets.\n\nNow if you tell me the UAF were willing to abandon all that because they didn't want to waste the manpower defending a hopeless tactical situation, to trade space to save bodies, then I'm all for that, especially in light of their desire to launch counteroffensives. \n\nBut that's not what happened. The UAF still were totally okay inserting themselves into a meat grinder, making utterly ruthless personnel readiness decisions akin to the Red Army in summer-fall 1941 (when Ukraine was no longer under threat of being conquered). Worse even than feeding the meat grinder in the manner they did, they did it in the wrong places.\n\n>Any further retreats would basically mean allowing an encirclement of UA forces further North. UA was in an unenviable position where they had to stand fast due to the geographic problems of their lines.\n\nTo hold Severodonetsk? That was a strategic policy to tenaciously hold very shitty ground with a massive reverse C shaped line instead of making the smart decision to give it up to defend the high ground on the near side of a river that would have needed about 1/5 or less troops to hold that trying to hold Severodonetsk, especially for half a month beyond the point most of the city was lost. Those extra troops could have been used to reinforce other tenuous areas.\n\nSeverodonetsk was the worst but there were other examples of bad decisions made that prioritized manpower and resources to the wrong places. They paid the price as a result.\n\n>If those troops had been taken to Donbas, would it have made a difference?\n\nIt depends if they were used smartly. For instance, if a proper defensive line behind Popansa was built and manned, would it have been broken through with ease, triggering an operational disaster that cost them half of the salient? \n\nManpower and resources allocation is what generaling is all about, it's why the saying that \"tactics is for amateurs\" exists. Had they used their manpower and resources more wisely they'd not have suffered the way they did. They made repeated mistakes at the tactical levels (like not abandoning Severodonetsk instead of trying to hold it tooth and nail), operational levels (creating a large scale  battle outside Kharkiv when there was none and no priority to create one), and strategically (expending cannon fodder troops to lose in the Donbas while still having the desire to launch two separate counteroffensives elsewhere). \n\n>Even then, Ukraine succeeded at inflicting about as many casualties as they took \n\nWe have no way of knowing what the casualty trade off was, and if it was 1:1 (which Kofman says was likely), while still losing ground, then that's not something to brag about. \n\n>repeatedly repulsing Russian attacks, \n\nRussian tactical doctrine is called Reconnaissance Fire Complex, it means ground probing advances to find the defenders and then schwack them with arty, rinse and repeat. It's slow as hell, it's extremely reliant on large quantities of ammo, but they can even do it with shitshow ground troops, as either someone on the ground can call in fires on whatever is shooting at them or the attack is overwatched by drones who can spot defenders fighting back or moving. \n\nAnd the UA did not have a means of countering it, because the way to do that means tactical mobility while defending (also going after drones and artillery). Note, if you can't do those things, don't purposely fight in a way that emphasizes Russian strengths, fight in a way to exploit their weaknesses. Even if it means losing a bit of ground...\n\n>and was able to totally withdraw all their forces in the end\n\nNot all their forces, it appears some limited number of UAF personnel (and a whole lot of civilians) were captured during various encirclements, as well as quite a bit of vehicles and supplies. But, yep, the vast bulk got away. \n\nHowever, like Ukraine successes during the Phase 1, I think that was far less to do with UA ability than lack of Russian ability. To pursue while performing hasty attacks means a major reliance on the initiative of leadership at the platoon, company, battalion, and brigade level, as well as a whole lot of trust, which are not things the Russians excelled at even before the war started. \n\n>which thwarted the main Russian operational goal of conducting an encirclement and made a lot of Russians on twitter angry that their army failed. \n\nThe main Russian operational goals were to take Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts.\n\n I'm not saying they fought well or smartly either, quite the opposite, but they did succeed in taking Luhansk.\n\n>Going to need a citation on that one because that is a pretty big claim.\n\nI'm on my cell phone at work, but if you go through my post history I've discussed this in length in late June and early July, to include with sources and quotes from senior govt officials stating that Kyiv authorized the retreats. \n\nHow much actual control each level of command had won't be fully known until long after this war ends and legit histories are written. But when Zelensky outright states the reason to hold Severodonetsk is because he'd rather lose manpower defending it than potentially lose more to retake it (pointless since he said that a week after 3/4 of the city was already lost) then he (or whomever is telling his how things work) is dictating strategy.",

The inherently political nature of the enforcement is.\n\nLet's go back to kosovo. The 'west' set up, staffed and funded a 'war crimes tribunal'. the US actively pressured prosecutors not to bother with anything the kosovans had done. The US (a country that doesn't recognise the ICC and literally sanctioned its investigators) coerced serbia into extraditing milosevic despite it being illegal under their constitution. They supplied as much evidence as they could about the serbs, but actively blocked investigations into our own side's actions.\n\nWar crimes prosecutions in practice are political theatre, just as they were in the first war crimes trials at nuremburg. They are not enforced fairly and evenly, but are in fact basically entirely dependent on political desire and power. That is of course because there is no international enforcement mechanism without ending the sovereignty of nation states.\n\n> If you don't want to use the term because you think it's political that's fine too, but let me remind you that you were criticizing people for using it incorrectly.\n\nI think that people have been using it brazenly, just like i think people throw around the term 'genocide' far too readily. \n\nI also think that in practice, war crimes prosecution is a joke.\n\nI also think that standing up against war crimes is important, but that we need to have a more functional system that everyone actually buys into and supports. International issues/ decisions require multilateral input, not just 'the west' deciding what is right and enforcing its decision on others.\n\nI don't think any of those are contradictory. My basic position is that i find the rhetoric surrounding war crimes somewhat eye-rolling. How the fuck can we feign outrage over war crimes when we ourselves deny our own war crimes and cover them up? So long as they remain a political tool rather than a genuine legal one, they may as well not exist. You cannot take the moral high ground and 'stand up for something' if your own demonstrated actions show that you don't actually believe in it. I will happily dismiss it as the propaganda fuelled bullshit that it is. \n\nIf a law isn't applied equitably then it isn't a law, but a form of systemic injustice/ oppression. Systemic injustice doesn't somehow become perfectly fine if it's against people we don't like.... it in fact just makes us the oppressors. If laws don't apply to one set of people, but to everyone else, then how is it really any different to segregation at a domestic level?

You're basically arguing two premises:  \n\n\n1. Russia requires good relations with the West for the Russian economy to function.\n2. To accomplish good relations, a new dictator would throw subordinates under the bus to some sort of ICC proceeding. \n\nPoint 1 is *debatable* and contingent on the degree that Russia can pivot eastward and the degree to which the EU can pivot away from Russia. While Russia's GDP is roughly the size of Canada's, the concentration of GDP matters far more for geopolitics than the net number (just ask Saudi Arabia). It's the concentration therein where the problem lays and I'm skeptical that the West can maintain a de facto embargo on Russian goods for a long time horizon. Economies are *far* more resilient than sanctions regimes would suggest (see: Iran) and the political calculations of regimes often weigh less on domestic economic concerns given that politics is a game of *power* and dollars do not always translate. \n\nPoint 2 is where I take most issue. The power equation of dictators is essentially that they *must* share power (the \"big man\" theory of governance where a personalist, unconstrained decision-maker rules with absolute power rarely plays out in reality for very long). Sharing power is  a function of selecting individuals who are competent *enough* to maximize value, but not so competent they capture a disproportionate amount of said value and threaten the leader's credibility (see: [this](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=551078094095127007070005127016002095081049061083007066108002119104020067083085055007046057121111064104105125035080003124125007117121118120069112003011120078102071009126103003107116090088075067023&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) fabulous working paper by Dr. Francois on the issue). Systematically undercutting political loyalists (and make no mistake, individuals who commit crimes for the previous regime tend to be loyalists - see *Why Not Kill them All?* for an overview of this) does not engender other elites to support a new dictator. If you know anything about Russian politics, the notion of a new leader kowtowing to the West is *politically radioactive,* so I'm surprised you think it's a likely event. \n\nFurthermore, where is this nascent dictator now? What faction in the Kremlin is full of people who want to oust Putin and appease the West? I keep seeing fantasies of a Kremlin full of liberal reformers waiting in the wings under an oppressive Putin, but I have never seen evidence to suggest this. Before you say \"oh Russia is a dictatorship so we can't get evidence\" I would suggest you look into [similar papers](https://ftrebbi.com/research/ftx.pdf) on China (once again borrowing from Dr. Francois and Dr. Trebbi) which highlight exactly how we can identify said factions. In any case, your post reads like a liberal european fantasy, not something based on a factual analysis of Kremlin politics. \n\nTL;DR? A new Russian leader isn't going to massively undercut his own domestic credibility by throwing a bunch of mid-level officers under the bus at the Hague and if you think that's going to fly in Russian politics, then you simply don't now what you're talking about. This would require essentially a complete overhaul of the Russian political system - which remains a *low probability event at best.*",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Even if Russia&#39;s next dictator currently acts as Putin loyalist now, the calculation changes the second he takes power - good relations with the West are necessary for Russian economy to function, while some mid-level officers associated with previous regime&#39;s lost war can be sacrificed at no cost to the dictator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is simply not true. You&#39;re basically arguing two premises:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Russia requires good relations with the West for the Russian economy to function.</li>\n<li>To accomplish good relations, a new dictator would throw subordinates under the bus to some sort of ICC proceeding. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Point 1 is <em>debatable</em> and contingent on the degree that Russia can pivot eastward and the degree to which the EU can pivot away from Russia. While Russia&#39;s GDP is roughly the size of Canada&#39;s, the concentration of GDP matters far more for geopolitics than the net number (just ask Saudi Arabia). It&#39;s the concentration therein where the problem lays and I&#39;m skeptical that the West can maintain a de facto embargo on Russian goods for a long time horizon. Economies are <em>far</em> more resilient than sanctions regimes would suggest (see: Iran) and the political calculations of regimes often weigh less on domestic economic concerns given that politics is a game of <em>power</em> and dollars do not always translate. </p>\n\n<p>Point 2 is where I take most issue. The power equation of dictators is essentially that they <em>must</em> share power (the &quot;big man&quot; theory of governance where a personalist, unconstrained decision-maker rules with absolute power rarely plays out in reality for very long). Sharing power is  a function of selecting individuals who are competent <em>enough</em> to maximize value, but not so competent they capture a disproportionate amount of said value and threaten the leader&#39;s credibility (see: <a href=\"https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=551078094095127007070005127016002095081049061083007066108002119104020067083085055007046057121111064104105125035080003124125007117121118120069112003011120078102071009126103003107116090088075067023&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE\">this</a> fabulous working paper by Dr. Francois on the issue).

Yes, a dictator has to share _some_ power, yes, a dictator is propped up by a loyalist block, yes, whoever comes next would have some resistance to overcome to change the country's course, but I think many people underestimate just _how much_ everything in Russia hinges on a persona of a single human being. Russia does not have the established institutions or a strong ideology to make the continuation of the course likely after a power transition. I would say that a new leader \"kowtowing to the West\" is more likely than not. Yes, it is politically radioactive _right now_, but not in principle, and most likely not after a humiliatingly lost war. Recall that \"kowtowing to the West\" was basically all Medvedev was doing ten years ago as the President of Russia. That same Medvedev who is nowadays jumping out of his pants in his telegram channel trying to appear warlike and ruthless. This says more about the adaptability of the elites rather than the fact that Russia is inevitably anti-West.\n\n>Furthermore, where is this nascent dictator now? What faction in the Kremlin is full of people who want to oust Putin and appease the West?\n\nFirst let's ask another question: which faction in the Kremlin has any political agency at all right now? Like it or not, but the entire Russian political life is about the war right now. Recall that right before the war broke out everybody was saying in unison that it is unthinkable, a Western provocation. Also recall that we have evidence that _very few_ people (Shoigu, Gerasimov, Naryshkin?) were aware of the coming war, but not the PM, not the head of the Central Bank, not the foreign minister, not oligarchs and ostensible Putin's friends. Yes, a dictator has to share power, yes, the consent of the governed (elites) has to be there in some form, but where the hell is the evidence of anybody but Putin and his pro-war clique having a shred of influence on Russian politics? Nope, the dictator surprised everyone, upended the private lives of _all elites_, started pushing for _maximalist_ war goals and keeps pushing 5 months in, forcing everyone to adapt and fall in line? This is not a course of action that is borne of the consensus of different factions in an opaque environment characterised by power struggles, this is the will of a single human being imposed without consulting others.\n\nBut still, it is a good question: What faction in the Kremlin is full of people who want to oust Putin and appease the West? If I were to guess, I'd say the entirety of the \"economic\" block (what was in the good old days the fiefdom of \"system liberals\"), Nabiullina, Mishustin, Gref, Siluanov, maybe Sobyanin. They don't have the tools to enact their wishes, so they are stuck in a local minimum, because all the enforcement powers are in the hands of the pro-war faction. Okay, who else? Who, of the Russian elite, most of which had children living abroad, had accounts and villas in Europe, and was enjoying a different quality of life before the war rather than after, would dream of ousting Putin? Some, but of course not all.\n\n>A new Russian leader isn't going to massively undercut his own domestic credibility by throwing a bunch of mid-level officers under the bus at the Hague and if you think that's going to fly in Russian politics, then you simply don't now what you're talking about.

I think you underestimate how likely a complete overhaul of the Russian political system is, because it would only need a single human being deposed. _Everything_ hinges on Putin. The constitution is Putin's, the concept of legitimacy is Putin's (he saved us from the chaos of the 90s, and now he remains the sole option of a competent statesman), the economy is Putin's (we'll share export rents if you stay silent and compliant), the ruling party (Edinaya Rossia) is Putin's, the enforcement apparatus is Putin's, the elites are Putin's, the propaganda machine is Putin's. With him deposed, the next guy does indeed have the option of being Putin 2.0, but this is hard (no backwards compatible legitimacy, no network of personally loyal people, no mythos), but it is more likely that the next guy will decide to throw the old guard under the bus to get sanctions lifted, shift blame for all the economic troubles, and to get the dissatisfied elites behind him.

At least this unit is mobile, and relatively fast. Unlike most radar, it can be used while on the move, which should make it difficult to target.\n\nFor comparison, Ukraine received only 4 AN/MPQ-64 radar from the US. Which have a range of 40-120 km (depending on which was sent) but its not mobile.\n\n30 of these Gepards may be more at risk close to the front, but having more of them should allow Ukraine to use them in higher risk areas.\n\nWhich helicopter mounted ATGMs are you referring? The two I know of (Vikhr and Ataka) have maximum ranges of 6 and 12 km.\n\nAs an aside, I was just wondering if they could target cruise missiles.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The stated radar range is 15 km. Of course Russian artillery is always a challenge, but thats true for anything near the front. At least this unit is mobile, and relatively fast. Unlike most radar, it can be used while on the move, which should make it difficult to target.</p>\n\n<p>For comparison, Ukraine received only 4 AN/MPQ-64 radar from the US. Which have a range of 40-120 km (depending on which was sent) but its not mobile.</p>\n\n<p>30 of these Gepards may be more at risk close to the front, but having more of them should allow Ukraine to use them in higher risk areas.</p>\n\n<p>Which helicopter mounted ATGMs are you referring? The two I know of (Vikhr and Ataka) have maximum ranges of 6 and 12 km.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I was just wondering if they could target cruise missiles. They fly relatively slow and could be shot down by one of these if they&#39;re in the right place at the right time, but I guess the problem is always spotting them in the first place due to how low they fly.

It's highly cited and is considered essential reading in regards to the socio-cultural state of Russia. Lethargy and Apathy in Russia goes as far back as the start of Imperial Russia and can be mirrored in Russian culture through literary works such as Dostovjetsky.[ \"THE  APOTHEOSIS  OF  RUSSIAN  LETHARGY\"](https://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1916_234.html) published in 1916 is short but well worth reading.

This, over decades, resulted in an even more cautious populace since an enormous amount of people were shipped off to labour camps never to be seen again. People noticed once friends and family members dissappeared, that the risks involved weren't worth it. Then recently during post-Soviet Russia (During Putin) you have the new internal propaganda technique called \"[the firehose of falsehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_of_falsehood)\" meant to exhaust the citizens by spewing an overwhelming amount of information about topics from every angle possible. It was incredibly effective, so much so that it has been used outside of Russia to great effect. It has shifted a large portion of the Russian population to a stance of \"I don't care about politics, I don't follow the news.\" since they would hear 20 different statements about an event all being wrong. On top of that, or parallel rather, you had the constant harassment, execution and imprisonment of opposition politicians (and regular people as well involved in anything from ballot counting to other innocent acts). The assassination of Anna Politkovskaya due to her reporting of the Chechen war is one example.

Meaning that you get NO natural UV light more than half of the year. That results in Vitamin-D deficiency, which in turn results in Depression (Seasonal Affective Disorder, the major symptom of this is lethargy). To what level this plays a role is hard to say but as someone who lives in the northern latitudes I can attest to the fact that there's a societal social hibernation during the winter, and that is with Vitamin D supplementation and fortification in all diary products. People don't do as much, see each other as much and are generally more tired. People usually take a trip to warmer climates at least for a week during winter for this very reason.\n\n\nWhile this is no where a complete picture, it at least covers some contributing factors.

Therefore people are sceptical.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Ukraine cant take that area back I think it&#39;s safe to say Ukraine has no chance of taking any area back any time soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is true and we should consider that situation, just like we should have considered the situation where Ukraine could not hold the Luhansk oblast.</p>\n</div>",

How much cheaper do you think the \"dumb\" rocket will be? Especially since you now have a new assembly line, testing, pre-production to Initial Operational Capability(IOC), to full-rate production. The pods HIMARS and M270 use are called MLRS Family of Munitions(MFOM) and are preloaded at the factory. So apart from the logistics train for a new rocket, a new pod configuration, or configurations, have to be inventoried. It's a cheap rocket, made to be fired en masse. If interception is a likely then fire multiples, that is what the system is made to do.\n\nIf the goal was to avoid interception the US could introduce a larger missile that carried penetration aids, or followed a quasi-ballistic flight path, or both.

Especially since you now have a new assembly line, testing, pre-production to Initial Operational Capability(IOC), to full-rate production. The pods HIMARS and M270 use are called MLRS Family of Munitions(MFOM) and are preloaded at the factory. So apart from the logistics train for a new rocket, a new pod configuration, or configurations, have to be inventoried. It&#39;s a cheap rocket, made to be fired en masse. If interception is a likely then fire multiples, that is what the system is made to do.</p>\n\n<p>If the goal was to avoid interception the US could introduce a larger missile that carried penetration aids, or followed a quasi-ballistic flight path, or both. It&#39;d also be much more expensive. At the same time you could add terminal guidance, like the PrSM is supposed to eventually have.</p>\n</div>",

I wish you would have just read on the wiki article on ballistic trajectory.\n\nA M31 rocket does not go mach 2.5 out of the launcher, it goes mach 2.5 after engine burn out during the terminal phase of the flight path. The rocket never goes super sonic during the boost or climb phase, only after it has gone past the peak of the ballistic trajectory does it start to accelerate as gravity is in effect. The missile will accelerate as it loses altitude until it reaches terminal velocity, that is when it goes mach 2.5 or whatever the actual TV is. That is how ballistic missiles(or rockets) work. \n\nAs for traveling just 20km, you'd need the dumb rocket to make a near vertical trajectory to minimize range and maximize terminal velocity to get that mach 2.5 figure. \n\nThe S-300PMU-2, the newest variant that is designed for ABM work, has a maximum intercept distance of 40km for a ballistic target. On paper. In reality the altitude of the object needs to be taken into account, as the higher the S-300 missile needs to travel the less range it'll have. A very crude guess is to take the maximum distance of the ballistic missile and divide it in a third to calculate peak altitude, so for a M31 you get ~23km altitude at the peak of the ballistic trajectory. The PMU-2 has a maximum range of 40km, and a maximum altitude of 25km. To reach maximum altitude the PMU-2 missile needs to climb in a straight vertical path, so if the M31 is at 23km in altitude our intercept range is going to be less than 5km. There are way too many variables, too many unknowns, and too much math(for me) to know what a typical intercept range is for a S-300PMU-2, but it is likely less than 25km for a ballistic object, during the terminal phase of the object's ballistic trajectory. Even that is hopeful, as ballistic objects are notoriously difficult to intercept. \n\nSo to confuse the S-300's operators you need a object that follows somewhat a similar ballistic trajectory of a M31. In Ukraine's case supposedly Tockha-U TBMs are being used, which has a similar range. \n\n> It seems to me that your conclusion is that there is no simple way to make fast rockets like HIMARs in a quick or cheap way.\n\nUnless the US is at full-scale war, like during WW2, military procurement is a long drawn out process that is handled by the globalized Western military-industrial complex.

Tactically they were not practicing economy of force.\n\nOperationally, OC-E was obviously struggling with manpower issues needing to use their poorly trained and supplied TDF units as main effort forces in the Donbas, and yet launched a counteroffensive in early May against the quiet Kharkiv sector, creating a large scale battle where there was no need to create one. They obviously cooked up the Kharkiv counteroffensive before any bad news from the Donbas salient campaign (Popasna breakthrough in mid May), and by that point they had to keep feeding the beast they birthed or else look week by retreating.\n\nStrategically, the Kherson bridgehead counteroffensive started in late May, but operations of that magnitude take over a while to plan and organize, which means they concocted it also before the Popasna breakthrough in the Donbas, and executed it afterwards because the gears were already in motion on obviously the GebStab didn't call it off.

The Russians were able to get over the Donets south of Lysychansk and take Nyzhnje on May 9 . The Popasna retreat was May 7 and the breakthrough of the poorly manned secondary lines behind it were May 14-22. The assault on Severodonetsk started in late May but only lasted a few days before the UAF defenders had to retreat to the western edge of the city. The GenStab flooded that city with more forces to hold it, the UAF counterattacked and achieved a brief tactical victory retaking part of the city center but were pushed back to the western edge a few days after that. Despite that, and even weeks after all the bridges leading into the city were destroyed, the UAF still didn't retreat from Severodonetsk until June 24. Toshkivka had fallen days before on Jun 21, which triggered the Zolote pocket starting days afterwards. And the primary supply route to Lysychansk was cut on Jun 23. By that point everything east of Siversk and Bakhmut was fucked. \n\nBefore that happened was when the UAF needed a hell of a lot more troops in the Donbas than it had.

            "body": "Extremely unlikely (I am not willing to say it to be zero, but it is as good as zero). \n\nFirst of all there is a clear political desire to liberate the south. And it not just because Zelensky said so, but the Ukrainian population demands a liberation of the south, as do the partisans and Ukrainians in general in the south. Sure, liberating Donbas (even if possible) would still be a political/moral victory, but people really expect that a town that has had visible and vocal dissent against the invaders from the first day of being occupied, to be liberated. Every day that passes, more and more Ukrainian civilians are disappeared in the south. So the Ukrainian offensive will come either towards Kherson or down south from Zaporizhia. \n\nSecondly (or really primarily), Ukraine can hope to go on the offensive only in situation where it has some considerable hope of success. And for there to be such an opportunity, there needs to be Ukrainian supremacy in numbers, have supporting AA systems as close and as dense as possible and have the enemies in a poor position to defend. In the large scale of things, there are two Russian salients that are protruding into Ukrainian held territory. One being Kherson, the other being Izjum. In Izjum Ukraine is clearly on the defensive on the south-eastern sector, supporting on the Sievierodonetsk river. In the northern part of Izjum salient, there has not been any substantial Ukrainian activity (as opposed to Kherson) and it is not in the south (see point 1). But if Ukraine were to attack somewhere else, based on the geography of the front, I would put it towards izjum/Kupyansk. But really, Ukraine does not have the forces in the area to do something like that. But in Kherson, Russians are fundamentally inhibited by the Dnepr. It is self-evident that maintaining that bridgehead to the west of Dnepr is not the best position for Russian army to be in.\n\nI will say that while it does not count as a \"feint\", the Ukrainian activities in Kherson, Zaporizhia, Izjum and Kharkiv throughout the period of the Battle of Donbas did absolutely also serve the purpose of tying down Russian forces and forcing Russia to send reinforcements/supplies to these other areas at the expense of supporting the offensive in Donbas.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Extremely unlikely (I am not willing to say it to be zero, but it is as good as zero). </p>\n\n<p>First of all there is a clear political desire to liberate the south. And it not just because Zelensky said so, but the Ukrainian population demands a liberation of the south, as do the partisans and Ukrainians in general in the south. Sure, liberating Donbas (even if possible) would still be a political/moral victory, but people really expect that a town that has had visible and vocal dissent against the invaders from the first day of being occupied, to be liberated. Every day that passes, more and more Ukrainian civilians are disappeared in the south. So the Ukrainian offensive will come either towards Kherson or down south from Zaporizhia. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly (or really primarily), Ukraine can hope to go on the offensive only in situation where it has some considerable hope of success. And for there to be such an opportunity, there needs to be Ukrainian supremacy in numbers, have supporting AA systems as close and as dense as possible and have the enemies in a poor position to defend. In the large scale of things, there are two Russian salients that are protruding into Ukrainian held territory. One being Kherson, the other being Izjum. In Izjum Ukraine is clearly on the defensive on the south-eastern sector, supporting on the Sievierodonetsk river. In the northern part of Izjum salient, there has not been any substantial Ukrainian activity (as opposed to Kherson) and it is not in the south (see point 1). But if Ukraine were to attack somewhere else, based on the geography of the front, I would put it towards izjum/Kupyansk. But really, Ukraine does not have the forces in the area to do something like that. But in Kherson, Russians are fundamentally inhibited by the Dnepr. It is self-evident that maintaining that bridgehead to the west of Dnepr is not the best position for Russian army to be in.</p>\n\n<p>I will say that while it does not count as a &quot;feint&quot;, the Ukrainian activities in Kherson, Zaporizhia, Izjum and Kharkiv throughout the period of the Battle of Donbas did absolutely also serve the purpose of tying down Russian forces and forcing Russia to send reinforcements/supplies to these other areas at the expense of supporting the offensive in Donbas.</p>\n</div>",

Another guess is most of their prewar units have been loaned out to other regions, because OC-W only needs enough to guard a relatively small sliver of hostile border.\n\nOC-N were responsible for Kyiv to Sumy, so obviously were busy until late March. Also hit VERY hard. Now they're likely reconstituting some units they have to keep to guard the Belarus border, but also have given up some units to other regions (for instance, a few UAF and TDF units known to belong to OC-N have been identified fighting in the Donbas salient).\n\nOC-E is responsible for what amounts to most of the current theater of war, controlling the front lines wrapping from Kharkiv to Zaporizhia oblast border with Kherson. Additionally, there is another corps sized command HQ, the JFO, that is specific to the Donbas area of operations, though I'm not sure if the JFO reports to Kyiv or is subordinate to OC-E. \n\nLastly, OC-S controls Odessa-Mykolaiv as well as the Kherson bridgehead and Kherson oblast on the east side of the Dnieper. They too got hit very hard in the early part of the war (which is why the Russians were able to take so much so quickly), and have been fighting hard to prevent a Russian attack on Mykolaiv until they launched a large scale counteroffensive against the entirety of the Kherson bridgehead in late May. \n\nLately, there have also been limited attacks from south and SE of Zaporizhia. That sector is technically part of OC-E but might have been shifted to OC-S. OC-E command is overextended C2'ing everything in the Donbas and Kharkiv, and since any effort to clear Kherson oblast from the east (OC-S's responsibility) must come from Zaporizhia, which is basically the door to that entire region. But then again there is a good reason to keep that sector under OC-E, as their operational HQ is in Dnipro whereas OC-S is based out of Mykolaiv. \n\nSenior UA govt officials are hyping a large scale soon to begin counteroffensive. Again, the Kherson bridgehead counteroffensive has been ongoing for nearly two months. They are talking about \"the South\" and not just mentioning Kherson city. The aide to the governor of Kherson oblast keeps taking about Kherson oblast being liberated by September. \n\nWith all that background out of the way, my guess is that Kherson bridgehead isn't a feint, it's just one sector of a larger operational counteroffensive directed by either OC-S or OC-E specifically against all of Kherson oblast, which would also cut the Land Bridge if they can retake the Isthmus of Perekop. \n\nThe bridgehead is getting hyped because of the expectation of a battle in Kherson city itself and the ongoing pressure they've been exerting against it.
