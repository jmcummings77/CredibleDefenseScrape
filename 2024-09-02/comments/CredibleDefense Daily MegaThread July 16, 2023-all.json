      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Hopefully this should reduce the spam on the megathread and also actually make those new accounts who constantly try to post in this sub realise that their stuff isn't showing up so they can stop. That being said, posts removed by reddit's Crowd Control AI^(tm) will continue to be by stealth, unfortunately we can't do anything about that.\n\nI'd also like to remind you all that there is a **100 character minimum** on posts. We instituted this rule during the 2023 Great Panic Of The Zaporizhia Offensive but honestly, it filters out a lot of incredibly low effort posts so we're keeping it. If you disagree though, feel free to reply to this message and we will take it into consideration. Also note: in the instance that your post gets removed, rather than fill it with useless characters (of which we'll take note), take a breather and question if it was truly worth posting.

Even his \"good nuggets\" must be understood in the context of generating a narrative. Other users do get unfairly downvoted for rational disagreement or posting the other side's perspective. I agree with you there.\n\nProblem is, while some Ukrainian sources are quite poor, some are also pretty spot on. Russian sources on the other hand are almost universally manipulative or outright fictitious. I've posted Russian sources that claim certain things before, only to be burned because the source was lying the whole time for propaganda reasons.

They're legal to use for obscurement and even legal (though unethical) to use to burn an enemy out.\n\nCluster munitions were banned voluntarily by a few countries who are either signatories or decided to follow it without signing (US). \n\nVery early on in this war Russia used both incendiary and cluster munitions as terror weapons in urban areas filled with civilians, which is as illegal as it gets, laws the Russians signed so they're culpable. Militarily, they've used both too, just not as much as they could.\n\nIncendiary munitions are pretty good at burning out fixed defenses, especially if they're urban based (burn down the building they're hiding in).

I had read numerous times that they are effective but never imagined to be on that scale.<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/443466354109186069/1130174280777338890/image.png\"> It&#39;s also very neat that three million shells</a> are available, most of it located in Europe.</p>\n</div>",

Adding another would make no difference, especially if the U.S. is just going to keep making exceptions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>however alleged footage has another drone attack from earlier in the day today which could in theory harm any last minute negotiations that may be ongoing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s walk through the logic of what the argument is: Russia wants impunity for its war ships to function in the Black Sea, unmolested, while they launch missiles at Ukrainian civil infrastructure. That\u2019s also putting aside the fact that Putin has obviously renewed the deal after the Crimean bridge attack, numerous drone attacks, and O&amp;G has continued to flow through Ukraine as well. </p>\n\n<p>These are all red herrings. If Putin decides to terminate the deal, it\u2019ll have nothing to do with any of these issues.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the West has purposefully <em>not</em> sanctioned Russia\u2019s agricultural sector. Yet, the Russians are crying about how much the sanctions are impacting their one unsanctioned sector, while claiming they\u2019re completely impervious to the actually heavily sanctioned parts of the economy.</p>\n</div>",

[This comment](https://news.err.ee/1609034381/grosberg-ukrainian-forces-getting-closer-to-significant-success) from the Estonian Defense Forces Intelligence Center got me thinking about linear vs non-linear returns on strategies. \n\n> Speaking at his regular Friday press briefing held at the Ministry of Defense in Tallinn, Col. Grosberg talked about the tactics used by Ukrainian forces to destroy the command posts and logistics centers of the Russian armed forces with precision strikes, the success in the areas bordering Bakhmut and the descriptions of the Russian general, which give an idea of \u200b\u200bthe end of the Russian reserves.\n\n> \"All this shows that the Ukrainians are close to success of a larger sort,\" Col. Grosberg said. \n\nThis is an imperfect analogy, but the first example that comes to mind is the famous trader \u201c50 cent\u201d who, beginning in 2017, bought options on the CBOE volatility index (VIX) - about $25k a day (50k options at $0.5). This amounts to a bet every single day that the market was going to crash - an unlikely event. They steadily lost money every single day, until they were $200 million down. Their stubborn losing streak became a joke to traders. [Then in a single market move on one day in 2018, they netted $400 for a total profit of $200 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/12/the-mysterious-trader-nicknamed-50-cent-made-200-million-last-week-as-the-market-blew-up.html). The author of the Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, made his money on a similar losing strategy leading up to the 1987 Black Monday flash crash. He also famously likened the inverse of his strategy, the dominant means of making money for banks through buying bonds, \u201ccollecting pennies in front of a steamroller\u201d. The idea being that lots of people in centralized organizations can get promoted by showing steady progress (interest rate returns) at the cost of high tail risk exposure for those organizations (the entire country\u2019s financial system crashes).\n\nWhy is this relevant to Ukraine? Because this was the essence of their Kherson interdiction strategy. There was a stronger case for it in Kherson in late 2022 because of the two-bridge dependency for such a large gathering of troops. It is often discussed separately from the more spectacular Kharkiv offensive but the two were intertwined - Ukraine loudly broadcast the Kherson counteroffensive to the bewilderment of many, which led to Russia drawing down from other fronts (Kharkiv included) to defend Kherson. On its own merits it was costly, but not as costly if you consider the broader fall 2022 strategy. They were positioning to take advantage of volatility. \n\nThe current offensive shares some features with the summer 2022 campaign. It was loudly broadcast by Ukrainians and there was no surprise when it started in summer 2023. It stumbled early on as Ukrainians appeared to throw themselves at walls of defense. Both feature a steady interdiction campaign aimed at command centers and ammo depots/caches. They differ strongly in that southern Ukraine is better supplied than Kherson was - there are no comparable single points of vulnerability. \n\nBut the biggest similarity is the treatment of probability. Ukraine\u2019s interdiction campaigns can be likened to steadily buying VIX options. It will lose a little on normal days, but the point is to be in position to take advantage of a crash when it occurs - thus the crucial importance to having reserves ready to exploit any such opening. Of course, no crash is ever guaranteed on the time scale of the options buyer. And anyone with veto power can get cold feet as you lose $5, $10, $50, $100 million, etc on the non-linear strategy. This is why western observers (eg a big bank) are often critical of the Kherson and now Zaporizhia offensives, as they have enough capital to weather a crash but also pursue a more linear strategy to winning (thanks air supremacy). But for a country like Ukraine there is no hope for such a confident strategy - they have to position for a non-linear gain. \n\nAll that said, this strategy is interesting to consider in light of the failed (?) Wagner revolt in late June of 2023. The current purge happening in the Russian military combined with the striking of command centers seems to encourage more volatility.",

                            "body": "Yes, in hindsight especially reinforcing Bakhmut in late February was a huge mistake. I mentioned it at the time but the biggeat proof wouldn't be obvious until later, if Ukraine was not perfectly prepared for the summer offensive they committed their reserves too early. Not all, but enough to matter. The continued campaign, especially fighting from a disadvantageous tactical situation, consumed personnel and supplies (especially ammo) that Ukraine needed later for this offensive. \n\nEvidence that came out with the DOD leaks and confirmed later by numerous large scale artillery donations through the winter and spring, the Ukrainians were as low as ever before on artillery ammo when they made the decision, and that was BEFORE the US agreed to an emergency resupply or scrounged South Korea for shells.\n\nThe campaign to reinforce Bakhmut and to hold it was a failure in every way, not only losing the city (it's objective) but the side objective, the attrition game, was also a failure, not attriting Russian forces that they'd later deal with during the offensive. Even then, losses against Wagner were largely among their convicts, and they didn't hurt that unit who were still quite formidable by the end of the campaign as the Wagner mutiny showed. \n\nVery indirectly, Ukraine supporters might try to claim credit for triggering the Prigozhin's mutiny and fall from grace, by suggesting the delay in a victory caused the disagreement ultimately leading to the mutiny. However, that's the Butterfly Effect, the Ukrainians didn't at all create that, bad relationships in the Russian command structure was already there and was going to get worse, Bakhmut or not.\n\nWhat I really hate is the argument that Ukraine retaking Bakhmut can be the success Ukraine needs to prove their offensive succeeded. I think that is just embracing positivity just trying to find some success to grasp. \n\nLiberating Bakhmut shouldn't even be that hard for the UAF, as the exact same problem defending it now applies to Russia: the city is basically at the bottom of a bowl surrounded by high ground. The Ukrainians control the heights to the west that allowed them the momentum to make the gains they had but if they go much further they've taken the high ground that dominates western and central Bakhmut. It becomes a bit more difficult after that, they'll need to cross the low ground and the river and then move uphill again. I also think it'll be easy because the Russians never heavily built defenses around that location, they never fully consolidated before this offensive started. \n\nBut taking it doesn't lead to anything. Take the city and even the high ground east of it and where does that set up the Ukrainians to go? East to be forced to cross the Donets? Southeast to more high ground?  There is nothing important immediately behind it, further away requires following routes that'll be as hard to punch through as the existing Zaporizhzhia defensive lines. \n\nThe best to come out of it,  besides the propaganda value, is again trying the attrition game, or the vague suggestion that it'll force the Russians to commit reserves, which they don't need to do even if they lose it.\n\nIf the Russians can't hold Bakhmut where they are right now without more reserves, they should retreat for the same reason the Ukrainians should have, Bakhmut isn't important. If they choose to hold at all cost and grind up their army, it'll be just as stupid as when Ukraine did it.",

The continued campaign, especially fighting from a disadvantageous tactical situation, consumed personnel and supplies (especially ammo) that Ukraine needed later for this offensive. </p>\n\n<p>Evidence that came out with the DOD leaks and confirmed later by numerous large scale artillery donations through the winter and spring, the Ukrainians were as low as ever before on artillery ammo when they made the decision, and that was BEFORE the US agreed to an emergency resupply or scrounged South Korea for shells.</p>\n\n<p>The campaign to reinforce Bakhmut and to hold it was a failure in every way, not only losing the city (it&#39;s objective) but the side objective, the attrition game, was also a failure, not attriting Russian forces that they&#39;d later deal with during the offensive. Even then, losses against Wagner were largely among their convicts, and they didn&#39;t hurt that unit who were still quite formidable by the end of the campaign as the Wagner mutiny showed. </p>\n\n<p>Very indirectly, Ukraine supporters might try to claim credit for triggering the Prigozhin&#39;s mutiny and fall from grace, by suggesting the delay in a victory caused the disagreement ultimately leading to the mutiny. However, that&#39;s the Butterfly Effect, the Ukrainians didn&#39;t at all create that, bad relationships in the Russian command structure was already there and was going to get worse, Bakhmut or not.</p>\n\n<p>What I really hate is the argument that Ukraine retaking Bakhmut can be the success Ukraine needs to prove their offensive succeeded. I think that is just embracing positivity just trying to find some success to grasp. </p>\n\n<p>Liberating Bakhmut shouldn&#39;t even be that hard for the UAF, as the exact same problem defending it now applies to Russia: the city is basically at the bottom of a bowl surrounded by high ground. The Ukrainians control the heights to the west that allowed them the momentum to make the gains they had but if they go much further they&#39;ve taken the high ground that dominates western and central Bakhmut. It becomes a bit more difficult after that, they&#39;ll need to cross the low ground and the river and then move uphill again. I also think it&#39;ll be easy because the Russians never heavily built defenses around that location, they never fully consolidated before this offensive started. </p>\n\n<p>But taking it doesn&#39;t lead to anything. Take the city and even the high ground east of it and where does that set up the Ukrainians to go? East to be forced to cross the Donets? Southeast to more high ground?  There is nothing important immediately behind it, further away requires following routes that&#39;ll be as hard to punch through as the existing Zaporizhzhia defensive lines. </p>\n\n<p>The best to come out of it,  besides the propaganda value, is again trying the attrition game, or the vague suggestion that it&#39;ll force the Russians to commit reserves, which they don&#39;t need to do even if they lose it.</p>\n\n<p>If the Russians can&#39;t hold Bakhmut where they are right now without more reserves, they should retreat for the same reason the Ukrainians should have, Bakhmut isn&#39;t important. If they choose to hold at all cost and grind up their army, it&#39;ll be just as stupid as when Ukraine did it.</p>\n</div>",

It was loudly broadcast by Ukrainians and there was no surprise when it started in summer 2023.\n\nI've been wondering about this for a year plus. The Ukrainians seemingly go out of their way to announce their main efforts in advance. Not to draw the Russians into an attrition trap, because both times they did them they were shocked by heavy resistance, stymied in their timelines and progress goals, and taking heavy casualties during the constant assaults they do their best not to talk about unless there was success. \n\nWhy? Some potential reasons:\n\n(1) They can't launch a strategic offensive with surprise, Russian intelligence will catch it. This is even true for Kharkiv, a full week before Russian milbloggers to include Rybar were giving warning of a UAF build up in the exact location they were really building up. The local Russian operational commander (WMD) screwed up by ignoring it, though maybe he might not even had the reserves to commit to stop it.\n\n(2) Morale is more important than surprise. Before each major strategic counteroffensive, August 2022 and June 2023, the UA govt and UAF worked diligently to get everyone fired up, especially Western supporters. Obviously it helps them get more support. Maybe they think they have no hope of getting what they need if they rely on surprise and deception. Maybe Kharkiv is just a fluke. One thing is certain, they definitely guide strategy at least partly by media response and attempts to remain positively trending. \n\n(3) Going beyond just morale, they need progress or the war ends. Jack Watling of RUSI recently said he was in talks with Ukrainian brass as far back as spring 2022 and they were already starting to plan a major counteroffensive. Why talk about it? Because they were losing all summer and needed to remind everyone, especially the West, that they definitely had lots of fight left in them. Had they not signaled a major offensive, could they have done that? And could they have shown they were serious without disclosing the general area they planned to attack (which at the time they announced it was one of the weaker areas of the Russian strategic front). \n\nFast forward, by late fall 2022 the Ukrainians have gassed out after their massive fall successes and everyone was wondering what's going to happen next? Many were speculating Crimea would fall with ease and the war was assuredly over. Could the Ukrainians stay silent during that period? Did they?\n\nBy December Zaluzhny was already talking about the strategic offensive he wanted to launch the following summer to return the front [to prewar lines](https://archive.is/dbUNW):\n\n>I know that I can beat this enemy. But I need resources. I need 300 tanks, 600-700 ifvs, 500 Howitzers. Then, I think it is completely realistic **to get to the lines of February 23rd**. But I can\u2019t do it with two brigades. I get what I get, but it is less than what I need. It is not yet time to appeal to Ukrainian soldiers in the way that Mannerheim appealed to Finnish soldiers. We can and should take a lot more territory.\n\nSo there you go. Talking up the offensive gained the UAF more supplies that they'd not have gotten (a substantial part of his wish list) had Zaluzhny and others stayed silent.\n\nMiraculously this time the Ukrainians didn't talk up where they were going to attack but it didn't take Clausewitz to narrow it down to basically 5-6 places in the whole country, and the UAF picked the most obvious 3 of them.",

If I was commenting about that in late August or early Sept, it was about the ongoing Kharkiv counteroffensive happening near Kharkiv city itself and to the east that had been ongoing since late April. That offensive saw immediate great success but then the Russians counterattacked, retook some ground, the Ukrainians counterattacked, and it went tit for tat for months. It was still happening in early September. \n\nThe location where the September Kharkiv offensive happened in Kharkiv Oblast but nowhere near the city, more specifically about their attempts to cross a river and hold a bridgehead near Staryi Saltiv, which they'd been trying to do unsuccessfully for months.  But that was a totally separate location, really a totally separate offensive (though quite a few of the brigades involved in the former were involved in the latter, namely the 92nd Bde). Minus the August 31 article, I thought it might be legit about a buildup, I secretly hoped it was, but I honestly didn't know much about that region because there hadn't been heavy fighting. I just felt if it was legit, not to add any additional discussion because OPSEC. \n\nThat said, I did downplay the potential for a major operational level success after the September Kharkiv offensive started because I was absolutely shocked the Russians didn't have any tactical or operational level reserves to counterattack effectively with, or aviation like KA-52, etc. Everyone was talking very early on about a Russian rout and rapid penetrations and I was urging caution in terms of expectations.

If I was commenting about that in late August or early Sept, it was about the ongoing Kharkiv counteroffensive happening near Kharkiv city itself and to the east that had been ongoing since late April. That offensive saw immediate great success but then the Russians counterattacked, retook some ground, the Ukrainians counterattacked, and it went tit for tat for months. It was still happening in early September. </p>\n\n<p>The location where the September Kharkiv offensive happened in Kharkiv Oblast but nowhere near the city, more specifically about their attempts to cross a river and hold a bridgehead near Staryi Saltiv, which they&#39;d been trying to do unsuccessfully for months.  But that was a totally separate location, really a totally separate offensive (though quite a few of the brigades involved in the former were involved in the latter, namely the 92nd Bde). Minus the August 31 article, I thought it might be legit about a buildup, I secretly hoped it was, but I honestly didn&#39;t know much about that region because there hadn&#39;t been heavy fighting. I just felt if it was legit, not to add any additional discussion because OPSEC. </p>\n\n<p>That said, I did downplay the potential for a major operational level success after the September Kharkiv offensive started because I was absolutely shocked the Russians didn&#39;t have any tactical or operational level reserves to counterattack effectively with, or aviation like KA-52, etc. Everyone was talking very early on about a Russian rout and rapid penetrations and I was urging caution in terms of expectations. The Russian screwups in that sector still surprise me. Someone with stars on their shoulder boards should have been shot for that.</p>\n</div>",
