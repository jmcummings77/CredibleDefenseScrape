They don't explicitly state, \"Antiwar sentiment exists because of Russian interference,\" but they strongly suggest that. The first two paragraphs begin by describing peace demonstrations, and say that they're uncritical of Russia. The third paragraph introduces the idea of a Left-Right coalition. The fourth paragraph then says this has been a goal of Russian intelligence.\n\nYou can absolutely bet that in the wake of this article, the narrative is going to be that the peace movement is a marionette of the Kremlin.\n\n> How do you define strong?\n\nBefore the war, opinion polls in East Germany showed greater sympathy towards Russia than towards the US ([this](https://www.rnd.de/politik/forsa-umfrage-ostdeutsche-fuehlen-sich-russland-deutlich-naeher-westdeutsche-den-usa-HMUGK6VO6BADTCBKZM6ZY4GANU.html) is one of many examples). Even now, [more than 40% of East Germans](https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/ostdeutsche-ostdeutschland-russland-ukraine-krieg-freundschaft-100.html) want to reduce or completely lift sanctions on Russia. There is a very deep split between the East and West of the country on this.\n\n> How are you analyzing whether or not there is or isn\u2019t any impact?\n\nIt's simply implausible. People have set opinions that are very difficult to change without a pretty massive media operation. Russia has very little presence in the German media landscape. The people who could be considered \"pro-Russian\" were already pro-Russian long before the war began. In the case of people from East Germany, they grew up in school learning Russian, taking class trips to the Soviet Union, they might have nostalgic views of the GDR and be resentful about many aspects of how the reunification was carried out (for example, mass unemployment in East Germany in the 1990s). A Kremlin-directed influence operation isn't going to make much of a dent, not least because the Kremlin has so few media levers to pull nowadays.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Where does the article attempt to do that? Be specific.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first four paragraphs frame the entire issue in those terms. They don&#39;t explicitly state, &quot;Antiwar sentiment exists because of Russian interference,&quot; but they strongly suggest that. The first two paragraphs begin by describing peace demonstrations, and say that they&#39;re uncritical of Russia. The third paragraph introduces the idea of a Left-Right coalition. The fourth paragraph then says this has been a goal of Russian intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>You can absolutely bet that in the wake of this article, the narrative is going to be that the peace movement is a marionette of the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do you define strong?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before the war, opinion polls in East Germany showed greater sympathy towards Russia than towards the US (<a href=\"https://www.rnd.de/politik/forsa-umfrage-ostdeutsche-fuehlen-sich-russland-deutlich-naeher-westdeutsche-den-usa-HMUGK6VO6BADTCBKZM6ZY4GANU.html\">this</a> is one of many examples). Even now, <a href=\"https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/ostdeutsche-ostdeutschland-russland-ukraine-krieg-freundschaft-100.html\">more than 40% of East Germans</a> want to reduce or completely lift sanctions on Russia. There is a very deep split between the East and West of the country on this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How are you analyzing whether or not there is or isn\u2019t any impact?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s simply implausible. People have set opinions that are very difficult to change without a pretty massive media operation. Russia has very little presence in the German media landscape. The people who could be considered &quot;pro-Russian&quot; were already pro-Russian long before the war began. In the case of people from East Germany, they grew up in school learning Russian, taking class trips to the Soviet Union, they might have nostalgic views of the GDR and be resentful about many aspects of how the reunification was carried out (for example, mass unemployment in East Germany in the 1990s). A Kremlin-directed influence operation isn&#39;t going to make much of a dent, not least because the Kremlin has so few media levers to pull nowadays.

Now they&#39;re back at it again, and this is the time when Russian activities are coming back full force.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that we have direct evidence of French, Austrian, British, American and other far right/far left politicians getting direct or indirect financing from Russian sources. This is how they do it.</p>\n</div>",

Yes they are opaque to \"typical sensor wavelengths\", but the less ideal wavelengths are plenty for terminal guidance. Also note that the reentry phase of a ballistic missile lasts about 20 seconds. A carrier travelling at flank speed can travel its own length in that time. Having no guidance for the last 20 seconds isn't a deal breaker. \n\nIn theory AShBMs do work. \n\n1. Terminally guided ballistic missiles have been in operation for decades. They're common enough tech that they're being sold to 3rd world countries. \n2. The Chinese have demonstrated Sub-50 meter CEP ballistic missiles, that's a known factor. We also have clear satellite imagery of their test ranges and are pretty confident they can hit carrier-sized moving targets, as long as they are target queued. \n3. They have their own satellite constellation to guarantee at least 3 to be able to observe the expected area of interest at any given time. Finding a carrier in the near-China Pacific theater is like finding a dime on a football field - sounds difficult, but is actually incredibly easy with computational methods these days. \n\nModern debate on this matter places the point of contention on point 3.

Again, whether they work is unknown, and what is known is probably top secret.\n\nGiven that carriers are enormously expensive platforms, and sinking a carrier severely degrades the US ability intervene in Taiwan, it's not unreasonable that China may be willing to expend >$1 billion on a single-purpose hard-counter platform.",

Having a much faster missile with much more energy means that when you're at a position where both fighters can detect each other somehow, say at 90km, then the better missile is going to be very likely to be lethal and the worse missile is going to be much less likely to hit. If you're the pilot with worse missile, that's very bad news.\n\nIn a situation like Ukraine where it's not possible to fly high within, say, 50km of the frontlines, this advantage is even bigger. The pilot with the missile that's almost guaranteed to hit at 90km can fly high outside of enemy air defense range, whereas the pilot with the worse missile has to fly low to get close enough to the frontline and be useful. Then the pilot flying high is going to be able to give a lot more energy to his missile and the pilot flying low is going to give his missile an energy disadvantage. What this means in practice is that when Russian planes are flying low near the frontlines they won't have to worry too much about Ukrainian fighters that can't see them since they're also flying low, but when Ukrainian planes are flying low they have to worry about a MiG-31 with an R-37M flying very high and very far, that they have absolutely no chance at touching, but that has a chance of killing them.

Propulsion is simply not where the bulk of the cost comes from, and there is nothing in the guidance of the R-37M that is going to be so much more expensive than a recent R-77.</p>\n\n<p>The basic point you seem to be making is that the West doesn&#39;t try to make missiles with a large kinematic advantage because it&#39;s not in doctrine. The Meteor and AIM-260 demonstrate that this is false. What has happened is that due to stealth fighters, there is a harsh limit on the size of missiles, so Western missiles became smaller while Russia continued to develop larger and larger missiles as radars became better and better.</p>\n</div>",
