The US military has used the technology on 500-pound bombs to larger 2,000-pound bombs to strike with a high degree of accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Officials did not say how many such kits or what specific type of JDAM would be provided. </p>\n\n<p>The precision bombs could help Ukraine attack fixed Russian defensive lines or other large targets. But they are normally dropped from aerial bombers or fighter jets.

Really it says to me that A) Zelenskyy wants to reaffirm the importance of the US-Ukraine alliance (this seems to be part of the media blitz which we\u2019ve seen since those McCarthy comments spooked people) and B)Zelenskyy feels confident enough in the war to leave temporarily. If the situation were bad, I have no doubt he\u2019d stay that\u2019s kind of his brand. This, to me, suggests that Ukraine doesn\u2019t see a Belarus operation as an immediate danger, or else we would see Zelenskyy waving the flag at home.</p>\n</div>",

Its defiant defense \u2013 when a Russian warship was famously told to \u201cgo f*** yourself\u201d \u2013 and then reconquest rallied a nation in the early months of the conflict with Russia, puncturing the myth of the invaders\u2019 superiority.\n\n>Now, whipped by winter winds, it remains firmly in Ukrainian hands \u2013 a speck of rock that has both symbolic and strategic significance.\n\n>A CNN team became the first foreign media to visit the island since it was recaptured in June, and to speak with the commander of the operation that led to its liberation.\n\n>A few acres of rock and grass, treeless and difficult to access, Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, lies around 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the Ukrainian coast, near its maritime border with Romania.\n\n>Getting there proved challenging: An hour being pitched from wave to wave in a small boat, showered with spray, in sub-freezing temperatures. The Black Sea can be unforgiving, and so can its hazardous coastline. On the way back our dirigible boat got stuck on a sandbar, and it took six hours before we were transferred, one-by-one, to another vessel in the darkness.\n\n>Snake Island is now a desolate place, strewn with wreckage, its few buildings reduced to shells, its half-sunken jetty battered by the tide. It\u2019s a graveyard of expensive military hardware \u2013 and is littered with unexploded ordnance and mines. This is not a place to be careless.\n\n>The CNN team saw at least four different kinds of landmines, Russian Pantsir surface-to-air missile systems, and an almost intact Tor anti-air missile complex. There was also the carcass of a **Russian** military helicopter that was hit.\n\n>Wondering among the wreckage, in a surreal scene, were dozens of cats, probably the descendants of the lighthouse pets from a more peaceful time.\n\n>Ukraine keeps a small military presence on the island as an observation mission. One of that detachment is actually Russian, a volunteer with the Ukrainian forces who goes by the call-sign Fortuna.\n\n>He\u2019d been living with his family in Ukraine. \u201cAnd here comes Russia attacking us.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/20/europe/snake-island-russia-ukraine-return-intl/index.html\">On Snake Island, the rocky Black Sea outcrop that became a Ukraine war legend</a></p>\n\n<p>Snake Island has a special place in Ukraine\u2019s folklore, now more than ever. Its defiant defense \u2013 when a Russian warship was famously told to \u201cgo f*** yourself\u201d \u2013 and then reconquest rallied a nation in the early months of the conflict with Russia, puncturing the myth of the invaders\u2019 superiority.</p>\n\n<p>Now, whipped by winter winds, it remains firmly in Ukrainian hands \u2013 a speck of rock that has both symbolic and strategic significance.</p>\n\n<p>A CNN team became the first foreign media to visit the island since it was recaptured in June, and to speak with the commander of the operation that led to its liberation.</p>\n\n<p>A few acres of rock and grass, treeless and difficult to access, Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, lies around 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the Ukrainian coast, near its maritime border with Romania.</p>\n\n<p>Getting there proved challenging: An hour being pitched from wave to wave in a small boat, showered with spray, in sub-freezing temperatures. The Black Sea can be unforgiving, and so can its hazardous coastline. On the way back our dirigible boat got stuck on a sandbar, and it took six hours before we were transferred, one-by-one, to another vessel in the darkness.</p>\n\n<p>Snake Island is now a desolate place, strewn with wreckage, its few buildings reduced to shells, its half-sunken jetty battered by the tide. It\u2019s a graveyard of expensive military hardware \u2013 and is littered with unexploded ordnance and mines. This is not a place to be careless.</p>\n\n<p>The CNN team saw at least four different kinds of landmines, Russian Pantsir surface-to-air missile systems, and an almost intact Tor anti-air missile complex. There was also the carcass of a <strong>Russian</strong> military helicopter that was hit.</p>\n\n<p>Wondering among the wreckage, in a surreal scene, were dozens of cats, probably the descendants of the lighthouse pets from a more peaceful time.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine keeps a small military presence on the island as an observation mission. One of that detachment is actually Russian, a volunteer with the Ukrainian forces who goes by the call-sign Fortuna.</p>\n\n<p>He\u2019d been living with his family in Ukraine. \u201cAnd here comes Russia attacking us. If some other country had attacked us we\u2019d fight too.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, he says, the Russians aren\u2019t doing much attacking, at least in this corner of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt this stage the Russians only perform air strikes,\u201d Fortuna told CNN. \u201cSo we can hear them coming. Plus we have observers all along the perimeter and we receive intelligence. So usually we are warned about a possible attack.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally they will see a Russian warship in the distance.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe need to be on guard 24/7 so we never get bored. There is always something to get busy with,\u201d Fortuna says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The troops here can\u2019t communicate with their families. Even when there is a signal, turning on your phone invites a strike. The small boats used to ferry supplies are often unable to make the trip, so a rotation here can get extended by the elements, sometimes for a week.</p>\n\n<p>Snake Island fell in the first few days of the invasion in February, as Ukraine struggled on multiple fronts against Russian forces. But before it did, there was a show of defiance that immediately became a meme for Ukraine\u2019s determined resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Ordered to surrender by an approaching Russian vessel, one of the small detachment there responded by radio: \u201cRussian warship: Go f*** yourself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Those words were echoed on everything from T-shirts to postage stamps and road signs.</p>\n\n<p>One of the small detachment on the island told CNN it was a pivotal moment, encouraging people to fight and volunteer.</p>\n\n<p>The man who led the operation to expel the Russians from the island, after they occupied it for several months, cannot reveal his real name.

The inability to locate muzzle flash, with the increased difficulty of locating the report of the weapon firing due to reduction in sound makes them incredibly useful.

Which is why most reputable centerfire cans aren't even made to be disassembled (neither my Sig or Surefire cans can be broken down).

The reason I find it hard to believe that it is, however, is that there are literally scores of foreign and Western journalists on the ground in Ukraine. The fact that Julian Ropcke, of **all** people, despite his borderline delusional reporting, and inability to understand even a modicum of context, has not been banned, makes this entire story seem like we\u2019re not getting the entire picture. It\u2019s key to recall that the WSJ, NYT, CNN, WP, FT, Sky, BBC and DW, amongst many others, have been reporting from Ukraine. Without their stories being controlled or editorialized by the SBU. However, these media organizations have abided by the rules that the Ukrainians have set for all journalists.

I've yet to see him, of all people, complain that he's being forced to spread Ukrainian propaganda.

That's precisely what my paragraphs that you don't want to respond to were about. And that's the actual crux of the entire debate. Did the SBU do something unfair that impinged on press freedom, promote propaganda and blackmail a reporter, or did it not? Without answering those key questions, your assertion that the public is going to respond differently to a \"moral\" question is presumptuous. Why should any discerning consumer of news not question a one-sided version of the events? More importantly, why aren't you? I can believe her, and still reserve judgement, while you've already decided that the SBU did exactly what she claimed they did. You can believe that's how she interpreted their response while disbelieving that that's exactly what they intended. The two are not mutually exclusive. \n\n\n>Similarly the previous posture of the US towards military embeds was also bad in a similar vein, although I'd argue that selective enforcement is far worse and far more coercive than a blanket ban on embeds and people in the west generally wouldn't tolerate the press being used as an arm of the state except in total war.\n\nWith the big distinction, of course, that the embeds were all working for U.S. media houses and Americans. The three journalists I pointed out to you from the Korea and Vietnam era also claimed that they were denied access to certain people in positions of power. There was no \"pass\" to revoke, but they were censured as much as they could have been within the bounds of the legal framework of freedom of the press.

That&#39;s precisely what my paragraphs that you don&#39;t want to respond to were about. And that&#39;s the actual crux of the entire debate. Did the SBU do something unfair that impinged on press freedom, promote propaganda and blackmail a reporter, or did it not? Without answering those key questions, your assertion that the public is going to respond differently to a &quot;moral&quot; question is presumptuous. Why should any discerning consumer of news not question a one-sided version of the events? More importantly, why aren&#39;t you? I can believe her, and still reserve judgement, while you&#39;ve already decided that the SBU did exactly what she claimed they did. You can believe that&#39;s how she interpreted their response while disbelieving that that&#39;s exactly what they intended. The two are not mutually exclusive. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly the previous posture of the US towards military embeds was also bad in a similar vein, although I&#39;d argue that selective enforcement is far worse and far more coercive than a blanket ban on embeds and people in the west generally wouldn&#39;t tolerate the press being used as an arm of the state except in total war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With the big distinction, of course, that the embeds were all working for U.S. media houses and Americans. The three journalists I pointed out to you from the Korea and Vietnam era also claimed that they were denied access to certain people in positions of power. There was no &quot;pass&quot; to revoke, but they were censured as much as they could have been within the bounds of the legal framework of freedom of the press. The 5<sup>th</sup> estate has always been viewed with deep suspicion.</p>\n</div>",

I estimate we can crank out about 250k a year to Russia's 2 million or so.\n\nAs far as guided munitions go, I think the USA can out-produce Russia. Certainly in the elite stuff. I think the USA can manufacture up to 12,500 Excalibur rounds a year. Can the Russians make that many Krasnapol? I am not so sure. Even if they could the Krasnapol is no Excalibur.\n\nAnd really, that is the question of this war - Russia has the advantage in brute force and Ukraine has the advantage in efficiency, what will prevail?\n\nThe USA has placed their bet on efficient precision guided munitions.\n\nAdditionally, in terms of production, allies matter. What the USA or Russia can produce alone matters a little less when there are entire coalitions producing these munitions.\n\nNATO has USA + Western, and especially Eastern Europe + Turkey + Israel + South Korea + Japan + Australia all contributing manufacturing power to the war effort.\n\nRussia has North Korea and Iran pitching in which represents quite a non-trivial artillery manufacturing capacity on its own. North Korea would mobilize as much as it would take to crank out as many shells as possible if Russia was willing and able to pay for it. It wouldn't surprise me if Chinese stuff is making it into the pipeline as well via honorable 3d partying.\n\nAmerica has been on a kick of re-shoring industry and bringing high end manufacturing home. Now is the time to invest in modernization and expansion and I think we will see that, but it is going to be sort of a slow but steady process.\n\nRight now most of USA's munitions come out of 5 government owned, contractor operated sites that each specialize and work in concert as a cohesive production line. \n\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn't really exist a free market for this stuff so there is not much competition to speak of. Companies can't independently make the decision to \"give 155mm production a shot\". \n\nThis means the only impetus to expand manufacturing capacity is the government making big orders.

Sure we run out of stingers and might be low on javelins, but the truth is we are not built to fight a war without the benefit of our air force and our navy plus all of the other goodies like missiles that actual hit targets and planes that are invisible to our enemies.  </p>\n\n<p>I rather we work with our current budget and not spend more to get us into more debt.
