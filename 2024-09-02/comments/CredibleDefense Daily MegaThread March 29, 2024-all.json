This leaves 297 satellites launched by non-SpaceX entities, which is uncomfortably close to the 213 satellites that China has launched into orbit.\n\nAnd here's u/foxthreefordale's [fantastic write up on how much China has moved forward](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/190l867/how_does_chinas_military_compare_to_that_of/kgr0kbh/) in the past decade in capabilities. The part I want to highlight is below:\n\n> NASIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center) [had a 2019 report](https://www.nasic.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1733201/usaf-nasic-releases-unclassified-competing-in-space-assessment/) on competing in space.\n>\n> In 2018, for ISR Satellites:\n> \n> - US - 353\n> - China - 122\n> - Russia - 23\n> - Rest of World - 168\n\nAt the end of 2021, the CMPR states:\n\n> At the **end of 2021**, China's ISR satellite fleet contained **more than 260 systems** \u2013 a quantity second only to the United States, and nearly doubling China's in-orbit systems since 2018. The PLA owns and operates about half of the world's [space-based] ISR systems.\n\nThis is a 2.13x growth in 3 years. \n\nNow, as we near the end of Q1 2024, China's ISR satellite fleet has grown to more than 470, a 1.8x increase from the last 3 years and 3.85x increase from the last 6. With further investment into space capabilities, including [searching for their own counterpart to SpaceX](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-31/china-offers-cash-to-rocket-startups-in-hunt-for-its-own-spacex) to supplement existing PLASSF launch capabilities, Chinese satellite count is almost guaranteed to continue increasing at a faster rate.\n\n> \u201cIt has become increasingly apparent over the past decade that the Russians and the PRC are coupling space-based ISR with satellite-aided, precision-guided munitions that can receive SATCOM-updated targeting,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cSpecifically the PRC has **more than 470 ISR satellites that are feeding a robust sensor-shooter kill web**. This new sensor shooter kill web creates unacceptable risk to our forward-deployed force. This is something that most of us are just not used to thinking about.\u201d \n\nWith 470 ISR satellites in space, *33% more than our 2018 count of 353*, it's not a terrible assumption to think that their targeting capabilities have caught up. Yet, there is still no shortage of people--analysts, service members, and the gen pop--who believe that the PLA not only are incapable of targeting our forces, but that they will be as inept as the Russians who have negligible space-based ISR capabilities.\n\nA lot of popular discourse still talks about the \"kill chain\" when it comes to the PLA. But as early as 2020, they've been talking about the kill web, which was a concept that emerged around the same time [DARPA announced their own research initiatives into it](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-09-18a).\n\nWhen you start digging through PLA NDU research papers, one thing becomes plainly obvious: the PLA is obsessed with American operational concepts. It's why they've modeled themselves to mirror what our *stated* capabilities are. For example, here is the above mentioned \"kill web\" concept from PLA NDU papers: \n\n- Initial paper from the PLA NDU in 2020 on DARPA's Kill Web: https://www.scribd.com/document/672205446/%E6%9D%80%E4%BC%A4%E9%93%BE%E6%A6%82%E5%BF%B5%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E5%8F%8A%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%8E%B0%E7%8A%B6%E7%BB%BC%E8%BF%B0-%E6%9D%A8%E6%9D%BE\n- Paper from PLA NDU in 2022 on modeling and developing system of systems on cross domain battle utilizing kill webs: https://www.jc2.org. cn/fileup/PDF/JCC-CN-202100216.pdf\n\nI've said this before in other comments, but so many people get obsessed in comparing individual platform stats (e.g. J-20 RCS vs F-35 RCS, AN/SPY-6 range vs Type 346B detection range, AIM-260 vs PL-15 range, ZTZ-99A vs M1A2, counting VLS tubes on a Type 055 vs a Burke Flight III, etc.) but it should be how an entire *system* operates with all the components available to it. To focus on those individual platform is quite literally missing the forest for the trees.",

This leaves 297 satellites launched by non-SpaceX entities, which is uncomfortably close to the 213 satellites that China has launched into orbit.</p>\n\n<p>And here&#39;s <a href=\"/u/foxthreefordale\">u/foxthreefordale</a>&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/190l867/how_does_chinas_military_compare_to_that_of/kgr0kbh/\">fantastic write up on how much China has moved forward</a> in the past decade in capabilities.

Perhaps it was virtue signaling, assuming that the US would do the dirty work anyway.\n\n\n[Defence of Baltic States, Poland Runs into Ottawa Treaty on Mines](https://pism.pl/publications/defence-of-baltic-states-poland-runs-into-ottawa-treaty-on-mines)\n\n\n>On 12 January, Leo Kunnas, chairman of the Estonian parliament\u2019s National Defence Committee, stated that Estonia might consider securing its border with Russia with, among other things, anti-personnel mines. Although Kunnas is a member of the opposition Conservative People\u2019s Party, his words sparked a debate about the potential consequences of such a decision, including possible withdrawal from the Ottawa Treaty and how to defend NATO\u2019s Eastern Flank countries. It was intensified by the signing of an agreement by the Baltic states on 19 January to establish a common line of defence on their borders with Russia and Belarus, which may involve the use of minefields. The effectiveness of mines has been demonstrated by similar lines in Ukraine (which has been a party to the Ottawa Treaty since 2005).

Perhaps it was virtue signaling, assuming that the US would do the dirty work anyway.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pism.pl/publications/defence-of-baltic-states-poland-runs-into-ottawa-treaty-on-mines\">Defence of Baltic States, Poland Runs into Ottawa Treaty on Mines</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On 12 January, Leo Kunnas, chairman of the Estonian parliament\u2019s National Defence Committee, stated that Estonia might consider securing its border with Russia with, among other things, anti-personnel mines. Although Kunnas is a member of the opposition Conservative People\u2019s Party, his words sparked a debate about the potential consequences of such a decision, including possible withdrawal from the Ottawa Treaty and how to defend NATO\u2019s Eastern Flank countries. It was intensified by the signing of an agreement by the Baltic states on 19 January to establish a common line of defence on their borders with Russia and Belarus, which may involve the use of minefields. The effectiveness of mines has been demonstrated by similar lines in Ukraine (which has been a party to the Ottawa Treaty since 2005). The Ukrainian armed forces mainly use anti-personnel mines (not covered by the treaty). Data published by, among others, the UN in 2023 shows that the Ukrainians use anti-personnel mines to a limited extent. By contrast, they are widely used by Russia (which has not signed the treaty), which has mined the Donbas areas it has occupied since 2014.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess that the Baltics didn&#39;t have to care when US support was taken for granted.

Episode 3 \u2013 Facility No.1, or all power in Zelenskyy&#39;s bunker</a></p>\n\n<p>This episode of the podcast had some interesting details:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Others would rise to the challenge and move from the highest government offices to the so-called Facility No.1, the deepest, most cramped bomb shelter, which would practically house the country\u2019s entire government for the first few days.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It looked like the film Stalker, to be honest. If you\u2019ve ever visited Pervomaisk and seen the museum of rocket forces, where strategic nuclear weapons such as The Satan (a Soviet-made missile, known to the West as SS-18 \u2013 ed.) were stored, [you\u2019ll know what I mean]. The trip to the bunker was very reminiscent of the descent to the missile silo.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Everything was like this: a long lift, then some stairs, then heavy doors. Long corridors.</p>\n\n<p>So while Zelenskyy and his team were protected by concrete and soil, Stefanchuk had to be &quot;creative&quot; when it came to finding protection.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We did the \u2018Kyiv shuffle\u2019 for a month.

If they don't, then they are supposed to be waiting to get an IFV/APC issued to them. \n\nIf they're motorized infantry, they get a wheeled vehicle of some sort, maybe a BTR but at this point anything with armor. If they don't, then they are supposed to be waiting to get an armored wheeled issued to them.\n\nIf they're rifle infantry or TDF, they're deliberately meant not to have vehicles of any kind as they're not meant to be mobile, per doctrine. They're either defense units or limited dismounted offensive operations. Not just the squads, they're deliberately limited in trucks at the company and battalion level too because they're not meant to be mobile. However, the disconnect is those battalions are often treated tactically as if they are any other, especially on the defense. While the mech and motorized infantry can use armor for basic, routine tactical mobility, the deliberate light infantry can't unless they find themselves wheels. \n\nBut again, they're not meant to have that because they're not supposed to be mobile, mainly because the UAF wants those units to be the simplest to create and the cheapest to operate. If they start getting added issued vehicles, it means the UAF is on the hook for issuing them, maintaining them (mechanics and share parts), and replacing them when they're broken down or lost. \n\nThis isn't even odd, the US dealt with it numerous times in recent conflicts since the 90s. While most of the Ukrainian and Russian infantry are mechanized/motorized, based on their shared Soviet background who obsessively mechanized their force structure, about 2/3 of the Army's and nearly all of the Marine Corps' infantry are light infantry, without dedicated, organic transportation of any kind minus their feet.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I am confused as to why individual squads even 2 years into the war still need to fundraise civilian logistical SUVs for themselves. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those aren&#39;t part of the unit&#39;s official table of organization and equipment, which describes everything that unit is supposed to have, based on the unit type. </p>\n\n<p>If they&#39;re a mech infantry squad, they&#39;re officially supposed to have a tracked IFV or APC issued to them. If they don&#39;t, then they are supposed to be waiting to get an IFV/APC issued to them. </p>\n\n<p>If they&#39;re motorized infantry, they get a wheeled vehicle of some sort, maybe a BTR but at this point anything with armor. If they don&#39;t, then they are supposed to be waiting to get an armored wheeled issued to them.</p>\n\n<p>If they&#39;re rifle infantry or TDF, they&#39;re deliberately meant not to have vehicles of any kind as they&#39;re not meant to be mobile, per doctrine. They&#39;re either defense units or limited dismounted offensive operations. Not just the squads, they&#39;re deliberately limited in trucks at the company and battalion level too because they&#39;re not meant to be mobile. However, the disconnect is those battalions are often treated tactically as if they are any other, especially on the defense. While the mech and motorized infantry can use armor for basic, routine tactical mobility, the deliberate light infantry can&#39;t unless they find themselves wheels. </p>\n\n<p>But again, they&#39;re not meant to have that because they&#39;re not supposed to be mobile, mainly because the UAF wants those units to be the simplest to create and the cheapest to operate. If they start getting added issued vehicles, it means the UAF is on the hook for issuing them, maintaining them (mechanics and share parts), and replacing them when they&#39;re broken down or lost. </p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t even odd, the US dealt with it numerous times in recent conflicts since the 90s. While most of the Ukrainian and Russian infantry are mechanized/motorized, based on their shared Soviet background who obsessively mechanized their force structure, about 2/3 of the Army&#39;s and nearly all of the Marine Corps&#39; infantry are light infantry, without dedicated, organic transportation of any kind minus their feet. That was deliberate, as light infantry is still very useful in certain conflicts, are extremely mobile strategically (globally) and it&#39;s MUCH cheaper than doing what Soviet-Russian-Ukraine did and try to mechanize nearly everything. </p>\n\n<p>However, every once in a while they end up in conflicts requiring regularly tactical mobility, so they&#39;d get issued cargo trucks, unarmored Humvees, up armored Humvees, MRAPs or sometimes commandeer civilian vehicles (in OIF, I can&#39;t remember who did it, but somebody jacked an Iraqi school bus to move their troops). </p>\n\n<p>This situation is the EXACT reason the US military took so long finally getting MRAPs for the GWOT.

Both armies use similar equipment and tactics.\n\nThe only area where I think Russia actually has an asymmetric advantage is in its air force and long-range strike capability, but this advantage is suppressed by Ukraine's powerful GBAD. And Ukraine's long-range capabilities have actually risen since the beginning of the war, thanks to domestic drones and Storm Shadows.\n\nThere are even aspects where Ukraine has an advantage, for example, their artillery, while smaller in numbers, has longer range and is more precise. It's not just HIMARS, Soviet 152mm howitzers (like 2S5 or 2S19) are inferior in every aspect to the 155mm Western howitzers than Ukraine is using.\n\nThe Vietnam war, on the other hand, is a classic example of assymetric warfare.

North Vietnam's regular army was severely underequipped compared to the U.S. forces.

Russia is definitely hurting Ukraine more, but Ukraine isn't standing still. Look at the recent attacks on refineries.\n\nMoreover, the damage is concentrated on the front lines. There is no guerrilla warfare, and because of air defenses, Russia doesn't have the ability to carpet bomb Ukraine. The artillery is leveling entire towns, but outside its range there are only occasional missile strikes. The aftermath of a typical missile strike in western Ukraine is much closer to terrorist bombings in the Middle East than to a typical Vietnam-era bombing. It's still tragic, but the scale is different.\n\nThat said, the worst part of this war may be yet to come. If Russia actually succeeds in destroying Ukraine's energy infrastructure, it will be devastating for the civilian population.\n\n>Also, the external power, without an immediately executable plan to simply conquer the PAVN/Ukraine, is turning entirely to kill ratios to save the day.\n\nWhat are you talking about? Russia is constantly assaulting Ukrainian positions. Because of their numerical advantage, Russia is willing to swallow higher losses in the hope that they will eventually pay off with a breakthrough. \n\nWe don't have solid numbers on human casualties, but we do know that Russia is losing heavy equipment at much higher rate than Ukraine.

By luring fighters out and away from civilian cover, they can be eliminated with less risk both to IDF and to non combatant populations that they would otherwise be mixed in with. I view this as a significantly improved strategy than the US/NATO GWOT strategy of \u201clets just walk/drive around until somebody shoots at us\u201d, and especially in terms of dealing with the remaining surface and subsurface element, it supports the Israeli ISR effort to map and detect these remaining network nodes and ports for their subsequent destruction. It is a game of whackamole, but unlike previous strategy it is actually being pursued as such, correctly in my view, contributing to its success relative to the difficulty of the task.\n\nI saw Spencer\u2019s interview with Netanyahu and they both make a strong argument for the unprecedented effectiveness of this operation both in terms of the kill ratio and in terms of minimising civilian deaths in comparing against other major cases of urban warfare such as ISIS in Mosul, or the Battle of Manila in 1945 (a case study Netanyahu in particular emphasised). The comparison to other urban operations by less sophisticated, or less over matched forces, resulting in even greater brutality, destruction, and attrition, such as Aleppo and Damascus, or Hue, only improve the IDF\u2019s comparative position, and that is the point being made by Spencer: no other force has killed as many enemy forces, for so few of his own, with so little impact on the civilian population, in so dense an environment, in so short a time. Anything comparable has had to make losing trades against a choice matrix of operational time, civilian death and destruction, own side deaths, or a failure to root out and destroy the enemy.\n\nFundamentally so much commentary on this war is a reduction to the point of absurdity over civilian death when operating in an urban environment filled with a hostile civilian population that has full support for the enemy combatant and is indeed complicit at every level across over a decade of active support for Hamas. It\u2019s a nasty bloody business, but there\u2019s no alternative now.\n\nPeople are uncomfortable with remembering that the first rule of war is to kill the enemy in the greatest possible numbers for the fewest losses among your own soldiers. All political and diplomatic aims and settlements rest upon this foundational principle that war is about killing, and fairness in war is suicidal. And yet despite this the IDF has been comparatively restrained and kept civilian deaths to a remarkable low, especially in proportion to actual confirmed combatants.\n\nThis absurdity is not limited of course to the Gaza war. Last night BBC radio was interviewing Japanese complaining that the film Oppenheimer did not show how horrible Hiroshima was, but instead celebrated the Trinity test and its subsequent use in forcing a Japanese surrender. Again this is absurd for a number of reasons, but the main is again that people don\u2019t want to accept the purpose of war is death, and victory is only the mastery of violence and unfairness.

Add up the total displaced number with the casualties, and you get a whopping 87.25% of the population. This looks especially bad when you consider that the official statistics had the Rafah population (the last civilian area that has not been displaced due to war) is about 11% of the population of Gaza.\n\nIt's easy to discount these percentages, which is why it's important to put the numbers into some perspective, France suffered about 1.44% population **killed** in WW2, and Italy at 1.16%.\n\n-----\n\nEDIT: in response to the people below b/c mods locked this thread chain:\n\nLet's get even more generous and knock off 10k from deaths and 20k from wounded and you're still getting 0.95% for deaths and 3.3% total casualty rate.
