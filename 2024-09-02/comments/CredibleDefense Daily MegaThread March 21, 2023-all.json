As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

I know they\u2019re old examples but Germany made an excellent navy to challenge the UK before WW1 while having nothing to rival their experience or history but had superior gunnery and design. They were out planned and maneuvered by the admiralty in a couple of battles before Jutland and were lucky to be able to escape but it never seemed like they were out fought even in those defeats. \n\nIn WW2 the US started our buildup early and we definitely had well trained/experienced officers and sailors but the Japanese navy had much better night-time training and more recent experience.

                "body": ">  But it is pretty much a fact that China soaring economic miracle is at its end and signals about much darker issues under the surface (lies on official statistics, incompetence and all the issues of a totalitarian state. I am not going to argue about the nuances here, but you dont build a national sirvailence aparatus at such levels if you have nothing to worry about)\n\nThe attitudes on China's economy often remind me of US perceptions of the Soviet economy during the Cold War, [which were based on intelligence estimates that ridiculously overstated Soviet economic statistics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1990/07/11/the-soviet-economy-boy-were-we-wrong/b51847ea-094c-4632-af4d-c6ec64890abb/). Corrupt, authoritarian regimes prioritize managing perception over responding to reality because that is how they stay in power. The point of the Chinese system is not to generate great economic growth for the people of China. The point of the system is to keep Xi Jinping in power, which it does by generating *the perception* of great economic growth, as distinct from the reality. \n\nBecause they can't actually create great economic growth without ceding power to individuals in the form of a free and open market that allows private persons to create and accumulate wealth. That sort of ground-up meritocracy is anathema to an authoritarian system because individuals empowered by the free market will invariably threaten the dictator, or their success will be perceived by the dictator as threatening (e.g, Jack Ma and the disappearing/cowed Chinese billionaire class). Plus it requires rule of law, which undermines the regime's desire to exercise power arbitrarily for their own benefit, subject to no specific rules or procedures.\n\nSo instead of creating a real market economy, authoritarian regimes engage in (usually poorly advised) large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus to generate the appearance of (and to some degree the reality of) economic activity. These policies almost invariably fail but rack up some form of unsustainable governmental debt (not necessarily explicit debt like government bonds, sometimes it is a form of debt that the government has hidden, e.g. in their central bank's balance sheet). Eventually the system collapses under the weight of ever-growing debt and spending allocated via inefficient centralized economic planning processes. Often such a regime will be tipped over the edge into crisis because of a long tail event negative shock, like an oil crisis or a pandemic or a war, which drives the budget beyond the projections produced by the government's overly optimistic planning processes. Those processes bias toward extreme overestimation of economic performance because they are intended for propaganda more than for realistic economic planning. Just look at any of the Soviet five-year plans, or the Chinese five-year plans from before the 1990s.\n\nFiscal stimulus can be useful in many situations, but in authoritarian regimes such funds are frequently diverted for corrupt purposes or even just for legitimate but economically suboptimal projects. For example, vanity projects like the 400km long arcology in the middle of the freaking Saudi desert that literally no one asked for and which will likely be rendered uninhabitable due to climate change caused by the very product from which the Saudis derive the wealth with which they are funding this incredibly ill-advised project.\n\nAuthoritarians almost always build militaries they can't afford, like Russia has over the past decades, or the Soviet Union before them, or Iraq under Saddam, or pretty much whatever authoritarian regime you want to name from the last 200 years. Possibly like we are seeing with China right now. \n\nOr via vanity weapons development projects like the Su-57, which make no progress and serve no real defense need, instead of hospitals or infrastructure or anti-corruption agencies or schools. I guess a well-educated, physically healthy population is harder to control. But in the end, a fleet of naval ships isn't going to put food on people's tables, no matter how what their total tonnage. Not unless you want to go rob the country next door, of course. \n\nThese regimes also play games with their monetary system to try to compensate for their weaknesses, as Russia has following the sanctions last year, or as China does with export subsidies. The People's Bank of China lets Chinese companies buy renmimbi with US dollars they receive in exchange for the goods they sell to US markets at a discount, effectively giving a little boost to the Chinese exporters every time they sell something abroad. That incurs an unrealized accounting loss for their central bank while granting a subsidy to Chinese manufacturers, but eventually one day the bank will need to realize those losses, and it may be forced to do so at an inopportune time that could cause hyperinflation, because printing money is the central bank's tool of last resort for eliminating debt it can't pay. But China has a thousand fiscal and economic ticking time bombs like that, many more than anyone likely realizes, because the government so strictly controls the flow of negative information. China's entire real estate market, for starters, seems more like an ticking thermonuclear economic bomb if anything. I have trouble seeing how the majority of older and elderly citizens tying their life savings up in crumbling apartments in fake, uninhabited cities will end well.\n\nIt can be easy to miss this happening because the authoritarian government tries to hide the existence of problems so aggressively. One common tactic is when such a regime flirts with liberalism to attract foreign investment, like the Putin regime under Medvedev's titular presidency or China under Hu Jintao. That convinces outsiders that the government has really changed its tune and is making a real effort to clean up corruption and issues around falsified data etc. Sometimes that works to slowly liberalize the country, but more typically any liberalization is a temporary indulgence permitted only for a short time before the regime cracks down. Usually at the slightest hint that liberal tolerance has paved the way for civil unrest which could threaten the regime. Like during the 2011 Russia protests, any of the Arab Spring revolutions, the Maidan, the color revolutions, Tienanmen, or Hong Kong.\n\nEventually the stimulus tricks don't work anymore because the government is in effect taking on an enormous debt load to buy things that are less valuable than the price they are paying for them, and the finances spiral out of control because the government can't even admit that what they are doing is not affordable until it is too late, because doing so would break the social contract whereby the people tolerate oppression in exchange for stability and economic growth. The debt is often squirreled away using smoke and mirrors too, like hiding export subsidies in the central bank's balance sheet, so often outsiders can't know when the house of cards is going to collapse. With this approach, the regime manages to purchase short term compliance from the population, but invariably it leaves them exposed to major systemic or economic shocks, like oil crises, pandemics, or wars. \n\nIn the end stage of this authoritarian bread and circus phase of a regime, just before the final systemic shock and crisis when the peasants with pitchforks show up and a NATO strike force comes screeching in to Gaddafi the leadership, the regime starts to play more and more tricks with statistics, or to outright invent and falsify them, because they need to maintain the perception that their economic policies are working in order to mollify the people and effectively bribe them into tolerating oppressive social and political controls.\n\nChina has been playing fast and loose with the statistics all along, but very much has accelerated that practice over the last ten years after Xi consolidated power with his \"anti-corruption\" campaign in 2011. That should be a huge red flag to everyone that the regime is not as stable as it likes to present itself as, and there are enormous cracks opening up in the economic foundation of China under the pressure of COVID, supply chain disruption, western countries pulling out of China or diversifying supply chains away from China, and the CHIPS Act. Eventually the propaganda will depart so far from reality that it will no longer fool anyone, and then things might start to get really tense in China.",

                        "body": "> But it is heavily skewed to think that the economic growth has not been achieved for a large portion of the population and that only the image of such has been accomplished.\n\nWell, I did say,\n\n> authoritarian regimes engage in (usually poorly advised) large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus to generate the appearance of (and **to some degree the reality of**) economic activity\n\nI wouldn't deny that China has experienced very real, fast growth. I just don't think it is sustainable growth, nor has it been as fast as many people have been led to think by China's careful massaging of their official statistics. Growth has been exaggerated in official statistics for many years now, so the divergence from reality only compounds over time, which will only make the final reckoning even more painful. Whether Chinese pensioners, SOEs, the PBC, or whoever else, someone will eventually be left holding the bag when accounts don't square following some major economic shock. \n\nCorrupt systems produce corrupt results because they cannot tolerate transparency, for the obvious reason that transparency would make it impossible to get away with corruption. Transparency would mean that Xi Jinping could be fired for screwing up too badly, but the leader cannot be held accountable by anyone else in an authoritarian system. Or it is much, much harder to do so at least, because accountability only flows upward in the system. That perverts more than just information flows around corruption. Information is too messy, and the controls implemented so authoritarian leaders can avoid accountability (e.g., by rigging economic statistics to avoid unrest) also prevent the free and efficient flow of information required for people to make sound long-term investments (e.g., by lying about the demand for real estate in certain areas, investors are misled into investing in empty Potemkin village cities). That makes efficient allocation of capital impossible.\n\nAs a simplified example, imagine if China had to exaggerate wheat production to make fudged GDP numbers line up. Now they may be constrained from investing to address whatever is reducing grain production, because that would be inconsistent with their official statistics. \n\nSystems like that can work for a little while, but eventually the wheels come off when all the various ways the government distorts the private marketplace for political purposes start to add up to what amounts to punitive taxation. China's decision to use Huawei for espionage dramatically reduces the private value of the company, as one example.\n\n> In essence, China has never flirted with liberalism to attract foreign investment. They've been fairly consistent ever since Deng: We'll liberalize economically, but will never liberalize politically.\n\nThe content of your argument here is purely semantic. You redefined the word \"liberal\" to exclude economic liberalism and then claimed that somehow adopting economic but not political liberalism doesn't qualify as \"flirting with liberalism\". I didn't split that particular hair in my analysis, but I would of course agree that the various liberalization waves in China and in Russia have been primarily economic and not political, but that's basically just the definition of \"flirting with liberalism.\" If they adopted more political measures, it would be more than flirting. However, activities such as joining the WTO are not exclusively economic actions. They involve adopting international standards for trade laws and many related economic regulations. Laws are fundamentally political, so in that sense political and economic liberalization are inseparable. You can't have a long-term sustainable liberal economy without laws that protect liberal property rights and due process and a million other things that authoritarian systems by their very nature cannot tolerate.\n\nAlthough this where your hair splitting does get us closer to the heart of where western policy toward Russia and China has gone wrong over the past 30 years. There was widespread consensus among neoliberal policymakers in the 90s that encouraging former Communist countries to adopt capitalist market-based reforms would inevitably lead to political liberalization and democratization. Which makes some sense in theory, because a liberal economy requires liberal politics to function in the long run, precisely because of the long-term accumulation of politically driven market distortions I described above and the need for politics that support liberal economic laws. It also requires an educated population, which in turn produces citizens who are more likely to want a say in their own government. Monied interests are more likely to push the political economy in an increasingly liberal direction, e.g., by insisting on regularity in systems for dispute resolution to provide a stable financial environment. Political liberalization may follow economic in China, but the past decade suggests it may not be inevitable.

Both are required for a liberal government to function well, but if history can prove anything, it's that people adopt bad governments all the time.\n\nThe failure to transition to more liberal politics despite limited economic liberalization does not mean their economies are thriving, nor that their economic liberalization is sustainable in the absence of supporting political liberalization.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>But it is heavily skewed to think that the economic growth has not been achieved for a large portion of the population and that only the image of such has been accomplished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, I did say,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>authoritarian regimes engage in (usually poorly advised) large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus to generate the appearance of (and <strong>to some degree the reality of</strong>) economic activity</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t deny that China has experienced very real, fast growth. I just don&#39;t think it is sustainable growth, nor has it been as fast as many people have been led to think by China&#39;s careful massaging of their official statistics. Growth has been exaggerated in official statistics for many years now, so the divergence from reality only compounds over time, which will only make the final reckoning even more painful. Whether Chinese pensioners, SOEs, the PBC, or whoever else, someone will eventually be left holding the bag when accounts don&#39;t square following some major economic shock. </p>\n\n<p>Corrupt systems produce corrupt results because they cannot tolerate transparency, for the obvious reason that transparency would make it impossible to get away with corruption. Transparency would mean that Xi Jinping could be fired for screwing up too badly, but the leader cannot be held accountable by anyone else in an authoritarian system. Or it is much, much harder to do so at least, because accountability only flows upward in the system. That perverts more than just information flows around corruption. Information is too messy, and the controls implemented so authoritarian leaders can avoid accountability (e.g., by rigging economic statistics to avoid unrest) also prevent the free and efficient flow of information required for people to make sound long-term investments (e.g., by lying about the demand for real estate in certain areas, investors are misled into investing in empty Potemkin village cities). That makes efficient allocation of capital impossible.</p>\n\n<p>As a simplified example, imagine if China had to exaggerate wheat production to make fudged GDP numbers line up. Now they may be constrained from investing to address whatever is reducing grain production, because that would be inconsistent with their official statistics. </p>\n\n<p>Systems like that can work for a little while, but eventually the wheels come off when all the various ways the government distorts the private marketplace for political purposes start to add up to what amounts to punitive taxation. China&#39;s decision to use Huawei for espionage dramatically reduces the private value of the company, as one example.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In essence, China has never flirted with liberalism to attract foreign investment. They&#39;ve been fairly consistent ever since Deng: We&#39;ll liberalize economically, but will never liberalize politically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The content of your argument here is purely semantic. You redefined the word &quot;liberal&quot; to exclude economic liberalism and then claimed that somehow adopting economic but not political liberalism doesn&#39;t qualify as &quot;flirting with liberalism&quot;. I didn&#39;t split that particular hair in my analysis, but I would of course agree that the various liberalization waves in China and in Russia have been primarily economic and not political, but that&#39;s basically just the definition of &quot;flirting with liberalism.&quot; If they adopted more political measures, it would be more than flirting. However, activities such as joining the WTO are not exclusively economic actions. They involve adopting international standards for trade laws and many related economic regulations. Laws are fundamentally political, so in that sense political and economic liberalization are inseparable. You can&#39;t have a long-term sustainable liberal economy without laws that protect liberal property rights and due process and a million other things that authoritarian systems by their very nature cannot tolerate.</p>\n\n<p>Although this where your hair splitting does get us closer to the heart of where western policy toward Russia and China has gone wrong over the past 30 years. There was widespread consensus among neoliberal policymakers in the 90s that encouraging former Communist countries to adopt capitalist market-based reforms would inevitably lead to political liberalization and democratization. Which makes some sense in theory, because a liberal economy requires liberal politics to function in the long run, precisely because of the long-term accumulation of politically driven market distortions I described above and the need for politics that support liberal economic laws. It also requires an educated population, which in turn produces citizens who are more likely to want a say in their own government. Monied interests are more likely to push the political economy in an increasingly liberal direction, e.g., by insisting on regularity in systems for dispute resolution to provide a stable financial environment. Political liberalization may follow economic in China, but the past decade suggests it may not be inevitable.

I needed to expound upon that analogy as to why they're different beasts, even if it's obvious.\n\nTo grasp a main theme that you posited, would it be accurate to say that you're arguing 'nontransparent systems are corrupt', and 'corrupt systems lead to false perceptions of progress'? \n\n- While I concur with the high likelihood of the first statement, it is not a given nor is it static. I focused on China's authoritarianism because the nature of its corruption has ebbed and flow over time, and because severe corruption is not necessarily limited to authoritarian systems. You can also have authoritarian systems that have marginal levels of corruption, or significantly less corruption than other illiberal states.\n\n- This is where I highlight the clash between the example of the USSR and modern China. The Soviets were corrupt to a point where it crippled their industrial production and research of cutting-edge technologies, in turn muddling their development. China, even if corrupt, has not been hampered to that degree.\n\nTo elaborate on that and touch on the second statement, we can still assess real progress and development being made in spite of whatever levels of corruption exist.\n\n- \"We just agreed that they are cooking the books on their official statistics.\" Yes, but not to the point that different sources such as the IMF, World Bank, CIA, and countless other intelligence agencies would buy their fibs. These sources all concur about the general size of the Chinese economy, as they do their own calculations based on unfalsifiable trade and input/output data that comes with China being integrated with the global market.\n\n- The hardest evidence of exaggerated Chinese growth statistics came from a study that analyzed satellite images to measure nighttime light intensity as a barometer of economic activity - this metric assessed there was a divergence in reported growth rates with expected light intensities in the late 2000s. However, the same series of studies also assessed that the divergence normalized back with reported growth rates by 2014/2015 (I unfortunately can't access the source right now, but I'll try to link it later).\n\n- This aligns with the heavy-handed anti-corruption campaigns that followed Xi taking power. To circle back to your statement: \"Transparency would mean that Xi Jinping could be fired for screwing up too badly, but the leader cannot be held accountable by anyone else in an authoritarian system.\"  The thing is, he *was* under threat of being removed, because he was still held 'accountable' by the various factions and subfactions within the CCP.\n\n- This is another part where clear delineations need to made between different types of illiberal regimes. Putin embraced corruption and reinforced it because those were the levers of power in post-Soviet Russia; it was useful for maintaining his control on power. Xi cracked down on economic corruption because the nature of CCP factionalism threatened his control on power. Even now, his position isn't fully guaranteed if he messes up his handling of social stability (I'll expand on this below on zero-COVID).\n\n- We can make the argument that the anti-corruption campaign was to centralize power around himself and to neutralize other factions. But there are signs that he went beyond simply replacing the old cadres with his picks. Acknowledgements of unreliable data started coming straight from his premier (who also candidly expressed frustration that if you added up provincially-reported growth numbers, this would overtake the official national numbers). Admonishments were given to provincial officials that reported faulty information, even those installed under Xi. Even retired officials, who had zero power at that point, have been quietly arrested for their involvement in dishonest reporting (by quietly, this means a short blurb would be released that they were put \"under review\", and they'd be never seen again).\n\n- I don't want to overdo any defense of the Xi regime. Yet on some economic matters, there are indications that the government noticeably 'smartened up' in the period from 2014-2019. This makes self-preservational sense for the reasons you put forward: Relying on faulty data is a threat to the long-term stability of their rule.\n\n---\n\nMoving onto the meat of political/economic matters:\n\n> You redefined the word \"liberal\" to exclude economic liberalism. \n\nMy bad here for editing my post for clarity only after you seem to have started writing your response (but before you posted it). I had reworded that sentence in my edits to read: \"In essence, China has never flirted with *political* liberalism to attract foreign investment.\"\n\nIt seems to be semantics, but this is quite precisely how the Chinese see it - there are two distinct tracks. To them, \"reform and opening-up\" is about economic ideology, and never about political ideology. \n\nThis goes beyond just broad slogans, as I'll address below:\n\n> Laws are fundamentally political, so in that sense political and economic liberalization are inseparable. You can't have a long-term sustainable liberal economy without laws that protect liberal property rights and due process and a million other things that authoritarian systems by their very nature cannot tolerate.\n\nI will say that I personally agree with the tenets expressed here. But let us consider that there are central-level [Chinese laws](https://en.ndrc.gov.cn/policies/202105/t20210527_1281403.html) such as the Foreign Investment Law, the Patent Law, Contract Law, etc., that have been created or regularly amended over the years as a result of China joining the WTO and further advocacy from foreign investors. \n\n- Many of these laws, with some created as late as 2019, actively emphasize the promotion of a market economy. However, none of them relinquish any idea that the Chinese state is not socialist nor is there any association with political liberalism.\n\n- The results? Trajectory-wise, a lot of these laws have made it easier for multinationals to enter the Chinese market and generate immense profits for themselves and for the local economy.\n\n- MNCs have also used these laws (appealing to the central government when something goes awry at the local or micro level) the break the high degree of expropriation, unfair treatment, and tech transfers that plagued the Chinese market in the 90s to 00s. \n\n- There's occasionally reports of foreign companies being excluded, ruled against in Chinese court, or treated in discriminatory fashion, but we would need compare this to relative to the overall volume of foreign companies operating in the market. Successful cases for MNCs don't tend to be as covered.\n\nI understand you believe China's growth, built upon this contradiction, may not be sustainable. But at least when looking at the past 20-30 years, it's overall been fairly successful at mitigating the tension between economic and political liberalization.\n\n> Zero COVID demonstrated China will subordinate economic interests to political interests to extremes, inflicting deep, unnecessary economic pain on the entire country just to avoid losing face by accepting western vaccines. \n\nThe whole multi-year lockdown and China's sudden about-face is also an example of Xi holding out because of his fears of instability, and then wilting when the system pushed back against him (I would even argue that Zero-COVID would have continued through 2022 even if they'd allowed Western vaccines).\n\n- For context, Zero-COVID worked undeniably well through 2020 and 2021, before Omicron hit. This success led Xi to think he could stick with it in 2022, *particularly* because the 20th Party Congress was approaching in October. In his potential calculus, if he 'allowed' the virus to have free reign beforehand, the mass deaths (even with high-efficacy vaccines) would threaten his ability to be re-elected by voters within the Party.\n\n- After securing re-election within the Party, he may have believed he could hold out until he secured his next presidential term at the state parliamentary sessions in March 2023. Some may think that as a dictator, these procedures are merely extravagant wastes of time. But every Chinese leader since Deng has treated these events with intense caution and wariness.\n\n- Then the protests of December hit the country, from Beijing, to Shanghai, to beyond. While these were suppressed, the extreme rapidity of the decision to re-open the country right after this (while also in the midst of a severe wave of COVID hitting Beijing) was a reflection of his intense fear of chaos. I'm not talking about a fear of the masses rising up - rather, his fear of this being capitalized on by others in the Party. \n\n---\n\nI'm running out of character space and don't want to make this a multi-comment reply, so onto defense:\n\n>  I repeat my point that fleets don't put food on the table.\n\nThis is where we likely diverge the most, because for the size of China's economy, the amount it's spending on defense should be quite nominal. US GDP last year was roughly $23 trillion, and China's was ~$18 trillion. US defense spending was >$750 billion (not counting additional hundreds allocated for military construction projects, veteran care, etc.), and China's was ~$270 billion.\n\nYes, there are other considerations in this such as USD exceptionalism (dollars can be printed in ways RMB can't) and hidden Chinese spending, but there's nothing to indicate that China is *overreaching* on its ability to spend on its military.\n\nI referenced the ability of China being able to procure those assets to highlight that they're doing so comfortably within the means of their economy and industrial base, in a way that essentially only the US can.",

But at least when looking at the past 20-30 years, it&#39;s overall been fairly successful at mitigating the tension between economic and political liberalization.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zero COVID demonstrated China will subordinate economic interests to political interests to extremes, inflicting deep, unnecessary economic pain on the entire country just to avoid losing face by accepting western vaccines. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The whole multi-year lockdown and China&#39;s sudden about-face is also an example of Xi holding out because of his fears of instability, and then wilting when the system pushed back against him (I would even argue that Zero-COVID would have continued through 2022 even if they&#39;d allowed Western vaccines).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For context, Zero-COVID worked undeniably well through 2020 and 2021, before Omicron hit. This success led Xi to think he could stick with it in 2022, <em>particularly</em> because the 20th Party Congress was approaching in October. In his potential calculus, if he &#39;allowed&#39; the virus to have free reign beforehand, the mass deaths (even with high-efficacy vaccines) would threaten his ability to be re-elected by voters within the Party.</p></li>\n<li><p>After securing re-election within the Party, he may have believed he could hold out until he secured his next presidential term at the state parliamentary sessions in March 2023. Some may think that as a dictator, these procedures are merely extravagant wastes of time. But every Chinese leader since Deng has treated these events with intense caution and wariness.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then the protests of December hit the country, from Beijing, to Shanghai, to beyond. While these were suppressed, the extreme rapidity of the decision to re-open the country right after this (while also in the midst of a severe wave of COVID hitting Beijing) was a reflection of his intense fear of chaos. I&#39;m not talking about a fear of the masses rising up - rather, his fear of this being capitalized on by others in the Party. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I&#39;m running out of character space and don&#39;t want to make this a multi-comment reply, so onto defense:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I repeat my point that fleets don&#39;t put food on the table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is where we likely diverge the most, because for the size of China&#39;s economy, the amount it&#39;s spending on defense should be quite nominal. US GDP last year was roughly $23 trillion, and China&#39;s was ~$18 trillion. US defense spending was &gt;$750 billion (not counting additional hundreds allocated for military construction projects, veteran care, etc.), and China&#39;s was ~$270 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there are other considerations in this such as USD exceptionalism (dollars can be printed in ways RMB can&#39;t) and hidden Chinese spending, but there&#39;s nothing to indicate that China is <em>overreaching</em> on its ability to spend on its military.</p>\n\n<p>I referenced the ability of China being able to procure those assets to highlight that they&#39;re doing so comfortably within the means of their economy and industrial base, in a way that essentially only the US can.</p>\n</div>",

Most people seem to just assume China will try a d-day style invasion and don't think about all the other pieces.   \n\n\nFor starters, China likely has a wealth of intelligence about Taiwanese defenses, from simple satellite monitoring, to other data collection, even sympathizers within the Taiwanese govt and military. China likely knows where every ammunition storage point is and most of Taiwanese plans.   \n\n\nAlso most people seem to forget, or ignore the fact, that most of Taiwan is well within range of Chinese shore based GMLRS.  Taiwanese defenses will likely be saturated with these strikes well before they can even get started. Their main ammunition storage sites, stationary air and sea defenses, airports, etc will likely be targeted. After that China's massive air force will also be able to attempt suppression tactics. Only after that will an amphibious assault begin.   \n\n\nAll the while their Navy will be surrounding Taiwan and working to blockade it from any outside support. Unlike Ukraine, we can't just load up some trains or semi trucks and ship in whatever we want. A lot of people assume the US will be willing to send tens of thousands of sailors into the most dangerous war since WWII, but I'm not so sure. One carrier being taken out by China could cause more US deaths than 20 years in Iraq... I just don't think the public will be able to support that kind of risk for Taiwan. On top of that, it'll take days or weeks for US forces to get there in force large enough to make a difference, and if China is doing well, the US may not be willing to risk it. If China is struggling, then they may be much more confident helping Taiwan.   \n\n\nAnother thing people overlook is the usefulness of US subs in the region. The Taiwan Strait, Luzon Strait, and E China Sea around Taiwan are very shallow and since about 2017 China has been very heavily investing in advancing the research of,  and deploying its sub tracking and anti-sub defenses in the area.   \nFinally, people seem to overlook the likelihood that China will probably already have some forces on Taiwan... China will be (and probably already is) working within Taiwan for years ahead of time. They'll want to embed sympathizers within the Taiwanese military, and I'm guessing they may even separately fly in, weeks ahead of time, some small special forces groups in Taiwan posing as tourists or something.   \n\n\nThose are just a few things off the top of my head that I never see anyone mention in a war with Taiwan. I am far from knowledgeable about any of this, but I do know its much much much more complicated for Taiwan than most people on reddit make it out to be.",

First, keep in mind that AI cant even drive cars right now, and flying a fighter is an order more difficult than that. Second, even if you could an AI to fly an aircraft, CAS is a complex process which includes a ton of complicated variables. ANd  were talking about flying an actual aircraft, not a purpose build drone. \n\nAnd then there is the A2A aspect. In basic combat maneuvers AI can kill a human pilot, if you give it the kind of perfect situational awareness possible only in computers. And then doing that only by using high-risk, low reward maneuvers which human pilots are specifically trained to avoid, such as high deflection shots.

This is something that only works 1v1, not in any other tactical scenario, and then only if the AI sets up the right conditions versus the human. \n\nGood breakdown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziCQqmEllZo&t=1516s) from an actual F-16 pilot. Were a lot further out than people think on fully capable, fully autonomous air drones. Remote drones and flying wingmen are a different thing, and much more viable short term.

The US is unwilling to supply Ukraine with any tool that would allow them strikes into Russia, which is why ATACMS (or any system beyond the standard HIMARS range) are also of the table. But fulfilling the other tasks is possible, albeit with cheaper, simpler tools. Sophisticated air defense systems like patriot batteries will deny Russia air superiority.

Pretty sure it\u2019s not a majority.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I also don\u2019t disagree with your statement this is an imperialist/colonial war, that is most likely one of the factors, but I also believe this war has multiple factors. Before the war Russia and Belarus were facing mass protests, you had Navalny causing a stir in Russia and Lukashenko flying around Minsk in a helicopter wielding an AK with his son, that could also be a factor, the dictators felt under threat and needed to secure their position.</p>\n</div>",

That was a company commander who seemed to voice a common opinion within his company.

He\u2019s had Scott Ritter on a panel\u2026ew</p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s good for getting a sense of the perspective of a lot of SE Asians in this conflict/ they really don\u2019t give a shit who wins but shoulder some resentment against the US more than they do Russia on the balance of things.</p>\n</div>",
