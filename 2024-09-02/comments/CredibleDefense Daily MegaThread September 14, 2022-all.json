It's the most intimate look yet behind the scenes of the diplomatic efforts.\n\n>Vladimir Putin's chief envoy on Ukraine told the Russian leader as the war began that he had struck a provisional deal with Kyiv that would satisfy Russia's demand that Ukraine stay out of NATO, but Putin rejected it and pressed ahead with his military campaign, according to three people close to the Russian leadership.\n\n>The Ukrainian-born envoy, Dmitry Kozak, told Putin that he believed the deal he had hammered out removed the need for Russia to pursue a large-scale occupation of Ukraine, according to these sources. Kozak's recommendation to Putin to adopt the deal is being reported by Reuters for the first time.\n\n>Putin had repeatedly asserted prior to the war that NATO and its military infrastructure were creeping closer to Russia's borders by accepting new members from eastern Europe, and that the alliance was now preparing to bring Ukraine into its orbit too. Putin publicly said that represented an existential threat to Russia, forcing him to react.\n\n>But, despite earlier backing the negotiations, Putin made it clear when presented with Kozak's deal that the concessions negotiated by his aide did not go far enough and that **he had expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory**, the sources said. The upshot: the deal was dropped.\n\n>***\n\n>Two of the three sources said a push to get the deal finalized occurred immediately after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Within days, Kozak believed he had Ukraine's agreement to the main terms Russia had been seeking and recommended to Putin that he sign an agreement, the sources said.\n\n>\"After Feb. 24, Kozak was given carte blanche: **they gave him the green light; he got the deal. He brought it back and they told him to clear off.** Everything was cancelled. Putin simply changed the plan as he went along,\" said one of the sources close to the Russian leadership.\n\nFirstly, this tells us that territorial conquest was an unstated war aim all along, which should be perfectly obvious to all but many still insist that Russia could be satisfied with Ukrainian neutrality and multilateral security guarantees outside of the NATO framework. So much for that narrative. Secondly, it also tells that Russian diplomats are not acting synchronously with Putin's will and may not even know what he wants\u2014they negotiate deals only to have them scuttled by the Kremlin. This dynamic could explain the provenance of the similarly lenient tentative peace agreement of April 2022 that was reported in [*Foreign Affairs*](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/world-putin-wants-fiona-hill-angela-stent) and sparked a conspiracy theory alleging that Boris Johnson torpedoed the deal. (Alternatively, they could be referring to the same deal.)\n\nBut the most interesting thing of all is, why are these highly placed Kremlin sources speaking to *Reuters* in the first place? Why are they leaking information that makes their boss look like a devious warmonger hellbent on conquest, whose war cannot be ended by diplomatic means?\n\n>Once the cameras were ushered out of the vast room with its neo-classical columns and domed ceiling, Kozak spoke out against Russia taking any steps to escalate the situation with Ukraine, said two of the three people close to the Russian leadership, as well as a third person who learned about what happened from people who took part in the meeting.\n\nOne wonders if there's a faction in the Kremlin that's trying to lay the groundwork for Putin's ouster by exposing his choice to pursue this unwinnable quagmire instead of a readily available diplomatic solution and making it clear that he has to go for his war to end.",

That was the best we could have gotten from them, and Libya was supposed to be a test case showing that we could intervene without regime change.

There's no point in talking to them (or tankies themselves for that matter).\n\nIncluding Russia into a \"balancing coalition\" is a pipedream, it wouldn't work. Instead of gaining influence in the world the West would lose it. It's just such a deep topic that I'm honestly not super keen on exploring unless you're legitimately interested in changing your mind. The condensed version is:\n\nRussia wouldn't turn liberal if you asked it nicely, so the only way to \"include it\" would be by offering the illiberal Russia Eastern Europe to dominate. Which means that the EU and nato loses 1/5th of its strength just from that alone. But then you've made the deal with the devil which will take away the West's greatest weapon - genuine belief that we're doing the right thing. That would make Taiwan way less interested in working with the West, along with other East and South East Asian countries. \n\nOn top of that there are absolutely no guarantees that Russia would play along and continue to counter China even after it got what it wanted. \n\nThe second strawman you built is that \"partial realism\" = realism.

So the -62M upgrades were done in the early 80s, probably you wouldn\u2019t see much newer gear than that. and so many -62s were built and upgraded, there are spare parts for even those newest models. \n\nIn terms of combat capability the -62M isn\u2019t bad, probably only really outclassed by the M60A3 and late state Leo1 variants. Add on armor on the turret, ERA, improved (but not thermal) sights, better engine, ATGM from the main gun. Ca. 1985 you probably wouldn\u2019t want your reservist unit in Leo1s tussling with with too many T-62Ms. Neither tank would really be safe from the other, and the -62M would have a lot of advantages and flexibility especially with that ATGM. But today it\u2019s the reverse story. Armor design has moved on, and even modern variants of the T-72 would be basically impervious to the -62M. The -72s in Ukraine would have a bigger, better, longer range gun, better armor, better era, better sighting equipment, probably thermals. They\u2019d shoot first, hit first, and probably be impervious to return fire. Where the -62M would do good work is A) against infantry in an SPG/assault tank role, and B) against non-tank vehicles like a BMP or BTR-4. Tho anything with an Auto-cannon and modern ammo would probably be a big problem for the -62. Not sure about a BMP-1 but I bet in side aspect even it\u2019s gun would kill a -62.

No social media video has surfaced of such movements.</p>\n\n<p>What Moscow is saying: Pro-Russian officials have denied any Ukrainian advances in the south in recent days, and the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces had sustained heavy losses during attempted assaults in the south. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ukrainian strikes continued to destroy pontoon crossings across the river Dnipro</strong>, Humeniuk said Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where they try to transport heavy equipment and ammunition with the help of barges, we hit and stop this process,&quot; she said. &quot;Our artillery work is connected with the <strong>destruction of warehouses with ammunition \u2014 three were destroyed in the past day.</strong>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>But Humeniuk acknowledged the <strong>Russians still had stocks on the west bank of the Dnipro</strong>, which is closest to the front lines running along the Kherson regional border.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Protests continue in the Armenian state capital of Yerevan, with protestors demanding their PM step down for not declaring mobilization or war.\n\nGiven that I've also seen reports that the dead will be exchanged, I think we're entering a cooling off period. So, what does this all mean?\n\nFirst, Armenia declared Article 4 of the CSTO Treaty, demanding Russia come to its aid. Russia came, but only as an observer mission, not outright military aid. \n\nSecond, Azerbaijan was able to launch a relatively bloody artillery strike with full impunity. Despite grumbling from NATO, there doesn't seem to be any real political movement to cancel arm sales to Azerbaijan, much less sanction them. That could of course change in the coming weeks.\n\nThird, Armenia's government is probably not long for this world. The current PM, simply put, is not popular. The protests are evidence of this, but so is the fact that Russia wasn't exactly rushing to come to his aid (considering the PM has more of a Western outlook, this is understandable).\n\nFourth, none of the major players actually wanted war. Not Russia, not Turkey, maybe Iran, but ultimately each side wanted peace, so that is what is coming.\n\nSo what happens next? Assuming the cooling off period doesn't immediately break down in the next few hours, the lines will stabilize and we probably won't hear much more military movement for the next few weeks at least. The big developments would be political. If Armenia's government does collapse, the next PM will likely be far more pro-Putin and far more willing to fight the war the protestors want. If it survives, they will have to deal with internal unrest and the ever-present threat of another Azerbaijan incursion (which I rank as highly likely--if there is no final peace accord).\n\nAs for the CSTO, who knows but Putin? The organization is practically just Russia from a military perspective, but having an ally get attacked and then to not respond in kind is a blow to their prestige. I'm glad of course a larger war did not break out today, but one has to wonder what exactly Russia's plan here is. Maybe they want to buy time until a more willing Armenian PM is chosen. Or, maybe we shouldn't discount Turkey's special relationship with Russia, as regards to the straits and especially Syria. I will say, after the Kharkiv rout, and after this weak, Russia's military prestige is in the practical dump. Their military I think is still quite strong, at least on paper. But we should also consider Occam's razor for an explanation: Russia did not rush to Armenian aid because Russia could not--a lack of available men, resources, and tactics precluded any outright strike on Azerbaijan. Until we see otherwise, that I think might be a reasonable explanation, coupled with some of the others I mentioned.",

And failing that, it is more likely to be a human aircraft with advanced stealth capabilities than an alien spaceship. \n\nA 3-12m long object flying 15km/s in the troposphere without causing a sonic boom, any heat from air friction, and no visible disturbance to the atmosphere at all seems to violate known physics. As with everything involving aliens, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. \n\nWhen you look at some of the error bars on their calculations, the lower end estimates put the airspeed at something very, very achievable even for human aircraft, around 850mph. It seems much more likely these UAP are conventional but advanced, human-made aircraft with an active camouflage system. The light intensity of their signatures cycles at 20hz, which suggests that they could be more or less \"updating\" their simulated light and radiation signature to match the background at that frequency. The astronomers timed their frame rate to alias in some way with the updates to the camo system, which I'm guessing would want to default to blackbody if it's in a transient error state or something like that, which would appear as a flickering black object like the so-called \"Phantoms\" do. Other times, it might overadjust to the brightness of the background ever so slightly, which would show up like the \"Cosmics.\" They detected many of the objects as they crossed the moon. The sudden shift in background intensity would be where you would most expect to see an active camo system lag or stutter. \n\nTheir calculation for the distance to the observed objects relied on colorimetry. Which seems like something that an active camouflage system would naturally be designed to interfere with. It's hard for an optically guided anti-air weapon to target something that appears to be 12km away, 3m across, and moving at 15km/s, especially when it is actually 2km away, 10m across, and moving at a more leisurely 0.37km/s (850mph). I would venture to guess that the system was optimized for radar and infrared signature, and this is just a little flickering gap in the slightly less important visual wavelength, and even then at well below levels detectable by the human eye.\n\nSo even if it's aliens, they're just stealthy aliens. Not impossibly fast ones. If it's humans... it seems unthinkable that it would be anyone other than the US military that could conceivably have developed that capability at this point. And then to have deployed it over Ukraine, which Russia clearly couldn't do and other countries with major aerospace programs likely wouldn't do.",

Don\u2019t know exactly where the statement comes from though. ~~Note that ceding Nagorno-Karabakh is not directly stated. However, there really isn\u2019t an alternative interpretation that I know of that is not frankly ridiculous.~~\n\nhttps://twitter.com/caucasuswar/status/1570061619748544512?s=46&t=2aYjTP9vwVfbr87Hmd9vYQ\n\nEdit: This was announced by Nikol Pashinyan during today\u2019s (September 14) session at the Armenian parliament. \n\nhttps://oc-media.org/live-updates-shelling-along-armenian-border-continues-for-second-day/\n\nAnd yeah, it deals with recognizing Azerbaijan\u2019s territorial claims if Azerbaijan recognizes Armenia\u2019s territorial integrity. \n\nEdit 2: In other words, Armenia will cede territory that is within Azerbaijan\u2019s international borders and Azerbaijan will return Armenian territory that had been occupied by Azerbaijan. (Check Edit 4)\n\nI don\u2019t know if this will work as Azerbaijan\u2019s primary effort is in the southern regions of Armenia, ostensibly to link up with Nakhchivan. Azerbaijan will likely demand a corridor to be opened or ceded by Armenia. Without that, there will be no guarantee of peace.\n\nEdit 3: This probably won\u2019t get international coverage on this. If anything, most of the coverage comes from Armenia while I don\u2019t see much from Azerbaijan.\n\nBut the conflict in general isn\u2019t generating much press as it is a bit overshadowed by the conflict in Ukraine, involved parties are not particularly well known, and it is full with nuances. With Ukraine, there\u2019s a obvious \u201cantagonist\u201d that being Russia who invaded Ukraine. With Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is a bit more complicated. In 1994, Armenia seized Nagorno-Karabakh proper and some surrounding territories. If Azeri accounts are to be believed, the Azeri people were effectively kicked out. However, that region is predominantly Armenian despite being within Azerbaijan\u2019s borders. The reason behind that can be traced to the Soviet Union and how they drew borders between Soviet republics. (It\u2019s pure border gore.)\n\nIn 2020, Azerbaijan took the territory surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and some of region proper. Can\u2019t really complain about that on a legal level as the territory is a de jure territory of Azerbaijan.\n\nIn the current day, arguably Azerbaijan is in the wrong. Most if not the vast majority of the Azeri military effort has been in southern Armenia and not Nagorno-Karabakh. So Armenia itself is being invaded. However, the cause has to do with the cease fire. Armenia dragged its feet in its promise to open a corridor to Nakhchivan and so did Azerbaijan in the return of POWs. In other words, the cease fire agreement failed in its enforcement. \n\nNow why did I go into that rant? Consider that a news story has a small time slot. In other words, it has to be short and sweet. With other issues dominating the field, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan isn\u2019t on the list of priorities. Now, try explaining the conflict in 2 minutes. Best you can do is discuss that Azerbaijan invaded Armenia, how the conflict is over Nagorno-Karabakh, and some responses from European and American officials. \n\nIn addition, due to nuances again, American and European responses will probably not be that strong exempting that proposal for sanctions that is in the EU parliament. Azerbaijan provides an alternative source of natural gas that Europe desperately needs. Some European countries\u2019 gas storage won\u2019t be enough to last them through the winter, even at 100% capacity. That is due to their systems only being built to resist short supply disruptions and not an entire season or two. Someone has to supply natural gas to these nations during the winter season, whether that be from other European countries with reserves or from other sources like Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. In addition, it is no secret that Armenia aligns itself with Russia and CSTO even though Armenia didn\u2019t have much of a choice. Armenia is surrounded by nations whose temperament ranges from unfriendly to straight up hostile. The West would not provide support so Russia it was. Despite the circumstances, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Azerbaijan invaded de jure Armenian territory. So the response is about as lawyer-like as you can get, \u201cWe condone Azerbaijan\u2019s actions and hope that Azerbaijan and Armenia can reach a peace deal expediently.\u201d Nothing more, nothing less. Words alone won\u2019t stop a war. In other words, the response is to distance themselves from the issue. \n\nTo Europe and especially America, this conflict is distant. With Ukraine everyone knows what Russia is. But with Armenia and Azerbaijan, the average American won\u2019t even know what they are, other than something about an Armenian genocide. Although, maybe the Europeans are better.\n\nThere is little demand for news from Armenia and Azerbaijan and only major events will be coverage. There\u2019s too many nuances and not enough demand.\n\nEdit 4: Apparently, Nikol Pashinyan was speaking about a hypothetical peace deal where Armenian territorial integrity was recognized and its security guaranteed. However, the opposition bloc of the current Armenian government believe the remark about ceding Nagorno-Karabakh is implied by the 49,800 km^2 remark which excludes Nagorno-Karabakh. \n\nThen again, Pashinyan does flip on certain issues. It seems that the Armenian language has a good amount of nuance and stuff that doesn\u2019t translate well into English. Or it could be that Pashinyan is not a decisive head of state. (I know the head of state is the Armenian president but it\u2019s basically a ceremonial position.)\n\nIf anyone speaks Armenian, here\u2019s the speech because I keep getting conflicting messages and I don\u2019t know Armenian. \nhttps://youtu.be/VmamhB3v8cs",

Every single squad is supposed to have one. \n\nEven their airborne, air assault, jaegar, and mountain brigades are motorized or mechanized too. The only brigade type that isn't SOF that can be construed as actual light infantry are the Territorial Defense Force, and that was because when it was created in January 2022, they had almost nothing to give them. They'll likely get motorized too over time as they gain more AFV. \n\n>Are we sure that Jomini asserts to manpower strength and not equipment strength?\n\nJomini's ratings refer to Modified Table of Organization and Equipment strength, so could be both manpower and equipment. Between breakdowns and combat losses (BMP and BTR are notoriously easy to kill), they will have all suffered rather heavy vehicle losses in addition to manpower. Note, not all of those units were defending, some (like the 93rd) are known to have been involved with other counterattacks, like the recent early August attack west of Izyum.",

Meanwhile, the separatist forces have become so badly marred and undersupplied they wouldn't be able to keep Ukraine from rolling through like they did last week in Kharkiv. The only reason the separatists were able to hold off Ukraine the past 8 years was because they were a relatively large and motivated force, but they weren't able to make any offensive gains. Only hold the line. They have only had offensive success this year compared to years past is because of Wagner's support and being backed up by Russian artillery and logistics. It seems their forces are so depleted now and so poorly trained in falling back and regrouping defenses, that they would be unable to slow Ukraine now without heavy Russian support, including tens of thousands of Russian troops, artillery, and armor. If Russia gives up on them they're screwed.  \n\n\nBut, I agree about Crimea. I do foresee Russia putting as many of its eggs in protecting the Crimean basket as physically possible. I think people here seem to be underestimating that. Even if Ukraine cut off the canal and took out the Kerch straits bridge (very unlikely), Russia can defend it fairly easily indefinitely as long as they want to. It'll be extremely costly to them, to do it, though.",

There's a lot of cases where dictator got overthrown as result of losing a war, but about as many cases where that didn't happen. He'd get replaced by a different dictator, as Russia never knew democracy.

The harvest of Russian armor is something that Ukraine now plans to use against the flagging Russian military.\n\n>**As Russian forces surrendered more than 2,300 square miles to advancing Ukrainian troops in a little over a week\u2014more ground than Russia has taken in the last five months of fighting**\u2014some troops running for their lives left vast stashes of Soviet-era weaponry, which the defending Ukrainians can now operate, including at least 17 vehicles on Monday alone.\n\n>Open-source tracker Oryx found that the captured Russian equipment varied from BMP-2 amphibious infantry fighting vehicles to scores of tanks, including T-80 variant tanks that date back to the 1980s, which experts pegged at about half of the combat-ready inventory. With poorly trained Russian units, some cobbled together from Russia\u2019s national guard and police forces, falling away from the front lines, Ukrainian forces stumbled upon an embarrassment of riches on the battlefield.\n\n>\u201cThey just left their tanks, artillery, special equipment, a lot of armor, and were just trying to save their lives,\u201d a Ukrainian military official told Foreign Policy, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide an update on ongoing military operations. \u201cThey will be used against Russia.\u201d\n\n>But even with formidable U.S. and European military aid that made the Kharkiv assault possible, including multiple rocket launch systems and artillery, **Ukraine is doubling down on its calls for more weapons in an effort to liberate as much Russian-occupied territory as possible before winter sets in**.\n\n>**\u201cThe U.S. didn\u2019t start their Lend-Lease program, but instead of the U.S., the Russian government started a Lend-Lease program for Ukrainian forces,\u201d** the official added, referring to the World War II-era program to provide U.S. allies with food, oil, and materiel that has been revived for Ukraine.\n\n>The losses of equipment, vehicles, and troops from the Ukrainian surge in the last week have also left some Russian units in tatters. Britain\u2019s defense ministry reported on Tuesday that the 1st Guards Tank Army\u2014one of Moscow\u2019s most prestigious military units, tasked with guarding the Russian capital or leading counterattacks in a possible war against the NATO alliance\u2014was withdrawn from Kharkiv in a \u201cseverely degraded\u201d state. \u201cIt will likely take years for Russia to rebuild this capability,\u201d the ministry assessed.\n\n>For months, as the full-scale invasion has forced parts of Ukraine\u2019s robust defense industry\u2014one of the largest in the former Soviet Union and one of the biggest arms-producers, period\u2014into semi-hibernation, the Ukrainian military has been able to capture, modify, and repurpose Russian equipment left behind or rendered ineffective on the battlefield, experts said.\n\n>\u201cThey\u2019re doing a lot of mods, like interesting things with captured Russian equipment,\u201d said Jeb Nadaner, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for industrial policy during the Trump administration. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a capability, particularly with captured equipment.\u201d Russian strikes have targeted industrial facilities, such as Kharkiv\u2019s tank repair plant and the Malyshev tank factory, forcing Ukraine to repurpose garages and junkyards to repair their vehicles or prepare captured Russian equipment to meet its maker.\n\n>But the capture of perhaps hundreds more modern and Soviet-era Russian vehicles comes as Ukrainian officials are pressing the Biden administration at high levels to send advanced Western main battle tanks to Ukraine, as the war-torn country has shown a higher degree of capability with tank and armored vehicle assaults against poorly defended Russian positions over the course of the lightning offensive. Speaking to reporters on Monday, a senior U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity based on ground rules set by the U.S. Defense Department, said reports of Russian troops abandoning equipment **\u201ccould be indicative of Russia\u2019s disorganized command and control.\u201d**\n\n>The Ukrainian military official who spoke to Foreign Policy said modern NATO-grade battle tanks, such as the M1 Abrams or German Leopards, were high on the list of Kyiv\u2019s requests to the United States and European countries at the Ramstein conference last week. The German Leopards appear more amenable to European armies versed on similar kit.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s seemingly insatiable appetite for more tanks is the sharp end of the military\u2019s desire to reclaim as much territory as possible before winter, experts said, when Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to use natural gas cuts and attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure to sap Western enthusiasm for the fight.\n\n>\u201cThat\u2019s why we are saying it\u2019s very important to get back as much of our land as possible before the winter comes,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, founder and director of New Europe Center, a Kyiv-based foreign-policy think tank, on Monday.\n\n>**Although Ukrainian officials are optimistic about getting more tanks from the United States and Europe in the coming days, the West has been noncommittal at best**.

        "body": "My take if you're a Russian general on probably the best course of action and why Russia can't do it: \n\n1. Russia is not winning the current attritional war. Unless the numbers are much worse in reality than we perceive, then Ukraine is gaining an advantage in every way every day. The amount of ground Russia gains is not compensating for their time and losses. The current strategy is unsustainable, and there does not seem to exist the ability to shift to an attritional war that would bleed Ukraine more than Russia. \n\n2. Defensive warfare is not acceptable at this stage. Russia has not accomplished its minimal goals, and stalemate lines are only likely to give Ukraine time and weapons while Russia's positions outside the battlefield continue to deteriorate. Waiting for Ukraine to buff up by freezing the front lines seems like the worst outcome because Ukraine will get stronger, Russia will continue to take losses by Ukrainian strikes, and Russia's economic and financial position which is awful becomes far more relevant in any intentional freezing. There are no military benefits such as increased production of equipment that Russia is waiting for either, so freezing the conflict seems like a dead end. The only exception is if Russia anticipates Ukrainian counter offensives that would dramatically fail and reduce Ukraine power, but it seems like Ukraine is cautious here so I wouldn't rely on it.  \n\n3. General mobilization seems unacceptable, and also not helpful. This is another deadend. \n\nSo you can't stop the war, you can't keep the war going at this pace, and you can't shift the war to an attritional rate that's acceptable. What's left and the most practical even if unlikely to work?\n\nFull commitment of all reserved equipment for a gigantic offensive to take the Donbas. I am talking all available guns, tanks, planes, helicopters. Probably in some pincer from Lyman and then from Zap in the south. Why this outcome? Because none of the other ones work, and if Russia can actually break through Ukrainian lines, they do have this, and only this shot to inflict a severe defeat on Ukrainian forces. This attack would probably have to take place as soon as the ground freezes, because Russia would need the time to get the men, equipment, and whatever logistics they can put together to do this. They would have to do this now because in a year Ukraine will likely be too strong for even a remote chance of success. \n\nI don't think the outcome odds are good for Russia to launch a huge attack with all they have left, but at the same time, their other options have worse outcomes. \n\nWhy won't Russia do this? \n1. Risk is too high of failure \n2. The political capital of failure is very high\n3. The Russian military would be fundamentally crippled after this offensive possibly for decades\n\nMost importantly: \n\n4. Russia still clings to the hope that the west will give up on Ukraine, and that the attritional math will start to work in their favor. \n\nSo ultimately, I think Russia is petty stuck.\n\nEdit: as a followup to my concluding thought on Russian hope for western support crumbling, I don't expect Putin to become desperate until it becomes clear this winter that western support failing won't happen. I don't think Putin will accept the idea of negotiations or limiting the operation or ending it altogether until he realizes that the west is going it see this war through.",

And of course western warehouses are far from empty when it comes to materiel for Ukraine's war effort. \n\nUp until recently I thought it was possible that Russia might be able to mobilize and change strategy in order to at least maintain the Donbas and land bridge. But I'm just not sure any more.

I believe it's not controversial to say that ~~rightly or wrongly~~, many ordinary Russians do view Ukrainians as a fraternal people; and they're not interested in nuking the capital of what they see as both a fraternal, neighboring nation and an ancestral origin of their nation.\n\nBut by the same reasoning, ~~rightly or~~ wrongly, many ordinary Russians do view Crimea as part of Russia.

NATO forces were on the offensive, which tends to be harder than defending. And [serious military analysts were predicting 2:1 casualty ratio](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-05-mn-776-story.html).

Presumably if Ukraine is in a position to assault it in the first place, they have stretched Russia thin enough to push them out of most other places and they can significantly outnumber the local defenders.

If every resupply truck for a week is blown up because it has to come along a single open road, how can defenders even expect to stay there? What this seems to me to favor is not the defender, but really just the side that has more air and firepower control. Effectively a defender is no better off than an attacker in such situations, because sitting still when you are under a microscope is no better than moving.\n\nI am sure it would still involve brutal fighting, but I am not at all convinced that simply digging in is a guarantee that Russia can successfully defend Crimea. If it gets to that point then the balance of military resources will likely already be decisively against them.",

You have no idea what Iraqi military looked like in 91 do you?\n\nThey had decent number of top end fighter barely a decade from entering service in MIG-29 and then still very modern multirole Mirage F1, in today's term that's F-35 and Rafale. MIG-25 that would be F-22 if you elevate them slightly, the west certainly feared them like they were for a while. SU-25 is literally what Ukraine still operate today only Iraq had a few times more 30 years ago, if you apply modernization it's PGM capable A-10 today. Then bulk of MIG-21 variants think of them as F-16. A sizable fleet of various Sukhoi fighter bombers ranging between legacy Hornet and Super Hornet. On top of which a moderate number of theater range bomber of H-6 and Tu-22 that no longer have equivalent today, maybe F-15E if you stretch the definition. Their fleet size was about 6x Ukraine's, apply a harsh post cold war draw down multiplier 1/3 that would still be 200+ mixed 4.5th and 5th gen fighter fleet, think of several early European F-35 adopters today combined.\n\nAnd gosh air defense, where did you learn to count? 100+ batteries of long range radar SAMs that's more than what NATO have today combined unless you add naval SAMs, tone down a bit(I lied a lot) the entire US army worth of Patriot batteries and several Aegis Ashore sites(that's what SA-2 was) with less than the latest interceptor, try have them all deployed within Ukrainian border. And hundreds of Roland, Strela-10, Osa; think Israeli SPYDER to 2010s NASAMS configuration. Backed up by even more less advanced Strela-1, let's call it Stormer Starstreak.\n\nWhere are those aircraft in a month and half in the face of coalition? From what I can tell in dust(or Iran), not attacking MPQ-53 radars. The coalition deployed from Europe and North America onto someone else's limited infrastructure not along its border.\n\nAlso 75 included rotary wing losses, also visually confirmed is less than actual loss but those are details.\n\nEdit:\nBasically in summary Russian aviation lost what it did by doing nothing useful in 7 months. Gulf War coalition erased Iraqi military after 75 aircraft losses so the ground campaign lasted 100 hours ended with full capitulation of Saddam.",

On top of which a moderate number of theater range bomber of H-6 and Tu-22 that no longer have equivalent today, maybe F-15E if you stretch the definition. Their fleet size was about 6x Ukraine&#39;s, apply a harsh post cold war draw down multiplier 1/3 that would still be 200+ mixed 4.5th and 5th gen fighter fleet, think of several early European F-35 adopters today combined.</p>\n\n<p>And gosh air defense, where did you learn to count? 100+ batteries of long range radar SAMs that&#39;s more than what NATO have today combined unless you add naval SAMs, tone down a bit(I lied a lot) the entire US army worth of Patriot batteries and several Aegis Ashore sites(that&#39;s what SA-2 was) with less than the latest interceptor, try have them all deployed within Ukrainian border. And hundreds of Roland, Strela-10, Osa; think Israeli SPYDER to 2010s NASAMS configuration. Backed up by even more less advanced Strela-1, let&#39;s call it Stormer Starstreak.</p>\n\n<p>Where are those aircraft in a month and half in the face of coalition? From what I can tell in dust(or Iran), not attacking MPQ-53 radars. The coalition deployed from Europe and North America onto someone else&#39;s limited infrastructure not along its border.</p>\n\n<p>Also 75 included rotary wing losses, also visually confirmed is less than actual loss but those are details.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nBasically in summary Russian aviation lost what it did by doing nothing useful in 7 months. Gulf War coalition erased Iraqi military after 75 aircraft losses so the ground campaign lasted 100 hours ended with full capitulation of Saddam.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Here is my cliff notes take on the Armenia/Azerbaijan war, and boy is it a shit show. Let me know if I made any wrong statements.\n\nOn one side you have Armenia, a country that is populated with Armenians who endured genocide during the 1915 Armenian Genocide perpetuated by Turkey. Their country/area was absorbed into the USSR around 1920 and remained there until the break up of the USSR. Armenia is mostly a christian-liberal democracy. They've wanted to side with the EU, but still need the protection of Russia. It puts them between a rock and a hard place. \n\nOn the other side is Azerbaijan and Turkey. Azerbaijan was absorbed into the USSR in 1920 as well. Azerbaijan is a dictatorship and mostly Muslim country. It is definitely more a right leaning country (putting it lightly) with corruption, misogany, and no interest in human rights. The president is Ilham Aliyev and his wife is vice president. Oh and Azerbaijan supplies natural gas to Europe. \n\nI mention Turkey because Turkey is a mostly muslim country ran by Erdo\u011fan, who is basically a better, more effective Trump. He became more or less dictator in 2017 bent on expanding his empire/powerbase using force. Turkey is also a member of NATO with US nuclear weapons based in their country. \n\nThis conflict is, as far as I can tell, a values difference between left leaning Armenia interested in freedom and human rights and a liberal democracy and Azerbaijan which is a country with right wing values. This conflict has been ongoing for a long, long time. \n\nThe most notable recent event is in 2020, Azerbaijan invaded Armenia and obtained new territory. They only stopped due to a ceasefire agreement mostly put in place because, afaik, Russia backed Armenia. Armenia got their butts wooped in that conflict and Azerbaijan essentially performed genocide of the Armenians in the captured territory. Azerbaijan essentially annexed obtained territory. \n\nFrom a tactical perspective, both countries have USSR era militaries. The difference is Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey, so they have TB2s and some other weapons. Armenia is backed by Russia, but only has antiquated USSR weapons. Armenia is significantly smaller with about 1/3 the population of Azerbaijan, so Armenia can't support a large military. Armenia would be on the defensive, but Azerbaijan can support roughly 2-3x as many soldiers as Armenia. Given the more advanced weapons and larger size of Azerbaijan, Armenia is pretty much screwed tactically. Also, Armenia hasn't gone through any NATO modernization effort like Ukraine. \n\nFrom a geographical perspective, Armenia is a landlocked stated with Turkey to the West, Azerbaijan to the East, Iran to the South, and Georgia to the North. None of them are allies and only Iran and Georgia can be considered neutral at best. \n\nA lid was more or less kept on this conflict by Russia and CSTO backing up Armenia. Now that Russia is shown to be weak, Azerbaijan is looking to take advantage of the power vacuum and obtain more territory. The US/NATO is reluctant to support Armenia because of Turkey. At least out in the open. \n\nWhat I expect: Azerbaijan will ratchet up this conflict for a full scale war. Armenia will put up a strong defense, as they are fighting for their survival but will ultimately lose - causing another Armenian genocide. The big wildcard in this is what international support Armenia is able to obtain? Will other countries jump in to fill the power vacuum to defend Armenia? That's a tough question. This war does offer an opportunity for a country to show their new power capability at the expense of upsetting Turkey and the Muslim world. \n\nNo matter what happens, Azerbaijan will be dealing with an Armenian insurgency for a long long time.",

It is definitely more a right leaning country (putting it lightly) with corruption, misogany, and no interest in human rights. The president is Ilham Aliyev and his wife is vice president. Oh and Azerbaijan supplies natural gas to Europe. </p>\n\n<p>I mention Turkey because Turkey is a mostly muslim country ran by Erdo\u011fan, who is basically a better, more effective Trump. He became more or less dictator in 2017 bent on expanding his empire/powerbase using force. Turkey is also a member of NATO with US nuclear weapons based in their country. </p>\n\n<p>This conflict is, as far as I can tell, a values difference between left leaning Armenia interested in freedom and human rights and a liberal democracy and Azerbaijan which is a country with right wing values. This conflict has been ongoing for a long, long time. </p>\n\n<p>The most notable recent event is in 2020, Azerbaijan invaded Armenia and obtained new territory. They only stopped due to a ceasefire agreement mostly put in place because, afaik, Russia backed Armenia. Armenia got their butts wooped in that conflict and Azerbaijan essentially performed genocide of the Armenians in the captured territory. Azerbaijan essentially annexed obtained territory. </p>\n\n<p>From a tactical perspective, both countries have USSR era militaries. The difference is Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey, so they have TB2s and some other weapons. Armenia is backed by Russia, but only has antiquated USSR weapons. Armenia is significantly smaller with about 1/3 the population of Azerbaijan, so Armenia can&#39;t support a large military. Armenia would be on the defensive, but Azerbaijan can support roughly 2-3x as many soldiers as Armenia. Given the more advanced weapons and larger size of Azerbaijan, Armenia is pretty much screwed tactically. Also, Armenia hasn&#39;t gone through any NATO modernization effort like Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>From a geographical perspective, Armenia is a landlocked stated with Turkey to the West, Azerbaijan to the East, Iran to the South, and Georgia to the North. None of them are allies and only Iran and Georgia can be considered neutral at best. </p>\n\n<p>A lid was more or less kept on this conflict by Russia and CSTO backing up Armenia. Now that Russia is shown to be weak, Azerbaijan is looking to take advantage of the power vacuum and obtain more territory. The US/NATO is reluctant to support Armenia because of Turkey. At least out in the open. </p>\n\n<p>What I expect: Azerbaijan will ratchet up this conflict for a full scale war. Armenia will put up a strong defense, as they are fighting for their survival but will ultimately lose - causing another Armenian genocide. The big wildcard in this is what international support Armenia is able to obtain? Will other countries jump in to fill the power vacuum to defend Armenia? That&#39;s a tough question. This war does offer an opportunity for a country to show their new power capability at the expense of upsetting Turkey and the Muslim world. </p>\n\n<p>No matter what happens, Azerbaijan will be dealing with an Armenian insurgency for a long long time.</p>\n</div>",
