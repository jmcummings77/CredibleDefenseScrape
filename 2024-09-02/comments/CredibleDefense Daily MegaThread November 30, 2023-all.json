Similar laws have been considered since 2021, but this is the first time that draft legislation has been seen by Russian media.\n\nThe draft law, which was first reported by the state news agency Tass, would require foreigners arriving in Russia to sign a document forbidding \u201chinderance of activities of state authorities of the Russian Federation, discrediting in any form the foreign and domestic state policy of the Russian Federation, public authorities and their officials\u201d.\nOnly those foreigners who signed the document would be allowed into the country, the news agency said.\n\nMoscow jails activist for 25 years for opposing Ukraine war\nThe requirements loosely mirror those for Russian citizens, who can be jailed for up to 15 years for intentionally spreading information that is seen as discrediting the Russian army or others involved in the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nNews of the draft legislation has come as the Russian supreme court is considering labelling the \u201cinternational LGBT social movement\u201d as an \u201cextremist\u201d movement. The fact that no such formal movement exists suggests that Russian law enforcement will be given carte blanche to persecute LGBTQ+ activists in the country.\nAccording to Tass, the draft legislation would also forbid questioning \u201cthe concept of the institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and values associated with the family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood\u201d.\n\n\u201cUpon entering Russia, foreigners would also be legally required to refrain from propagandising non-traditional sexual relations,\u201d the draft legislation said.",

Similar laws have been considered since 2021, but this is the first time that draft legislation has been seen by Russian media.</p>\n\n<p>The draft law, which was first reported by the state news agency Tass, would require foreigners arriving in Russia to sign a document forbidding \u201chinderance of activities of state authorities of the Russian Federation, discrediting in any form the foreign and domestic state policy of the Russian Federation, public authorities and their officials\u201d.\nOnly those foreigners who signed the document would be allowed into the country, the news agency said.</p>\n\n<p>Moscow jails activist for 25 years for opposing Ukraine war\nThe requirements loosely mirror those for Russian citizens, who can be jailed for up to 15 years for intentionally spreading information that is seen as discrediting the Russian army or others involved in the fighting in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>News of the draft legislation has come as the Russian supreme court is considering labelling the \u201cinternational LGBT social movement\u201d as an \u201cextremist\u201d movement. The fact that no such formal movement exists suggests that Russian law enforcement will be given carte blanche to persecute LGBTQ+ activists in the country.\nAccording to Tass, the draft legislation would also forbid questioning \u201cthe concept of the institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and values associated with the family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUpon entering Russia, foreigners would also be legally required to refrain from propagandising non-traditional sexual relations,\u201d the draft legislation said.</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;m not here to argue that your ideology and values are any more or less valid than the others, I just wanted to clarify that there is a difference there and point out what it is.</p>\n</div>",

And this weapon can save us and it proves itself time and time again.\"\n\nNational Unity Party leader Benny Gantz expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to those wounded, saying \"This attack is further proof of our commitment to continue the fight with strength and determination against the murderous terrorism that threatens our citizens: in Jerusalem, in Gaza, in the West Bank, and everywhere.\"\n\n\nUS Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew condemned the attack on Thursday, posting on X (formerly Twitter): \"Abhorrent terrorist attack in Jerusalem this morning.

The EU condemns all forms of terrorism and stands with Israel in this difficult time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, an IDF soldier was shot and killed and five other Israelis were wounded by a Palestinian terrorist at a security checkpoint on the Bethlehem bypass road south of Jerusalem.\nAttack comes a year after bombing at the same bus stop</p>\n\n<p>Last November, two Israelis, Tadasa Tashume Ben Ma\u2019ada and Arye Shechopek, were killed in a double bombing attack that took place at the same bus stop and at another one near the Ramot neighborhood.</p>\n</div>",

The Israeli head of state was describing his nation\u2019s horror over the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 when the pope issued a blunt rejoinder.\n\n>It is \u201cforbidden to respond to terror with terror,\u201d Francis said, according to a senior Israeli official familiar with the call, which has not been previously reported.\n\n>Herzog protested, repeating the position that the Israeli government was doing what was needed in Gaza to defend its own people. The pope continued, saying those responsible should indeed be held accountable, but not civilians.\n\n\nBefore you pile on the pope. \n\n>Even his harshest Jewish critics are not suggesting that Francis is trafficking in antisemitism, a scourge he has repeatedly denounced.\n\n>As a cardinal in Buenos Aires \u2014 home to one of the world\u2019s largest Jewish populations \u2014 Francis was known to celebrate Jewish holidays with locals, helping to light menorahs during Hanukkah.\n\n>In 2015, he marked the 50th anniversary of Nostra Aetate \u2014 the Vatican II declaration that sought to remove Biblical-era blame for Jesus\u2019s death on the Jewish people \u2014 with one of the strongest defenses of Israel by a sitting pope. \u201cTo attack Jews is antisemitism, but an outright attack on the State of Israel is also antisemitism,\u201d he said.\n\n>More than previous pontiffs, though, the first Latin American pope has also championed human rights, seeing the downtrodden, the underdogs and the oppressed as his primary cause. He reflects the Global South\u2019s general distrust and skepticism of the West and its allies, as well as more sympathetic views toward Palestinians and Russia.\n\n\nThe article has plenty of quotes from various Jewish leader freaking out about the pope.

The Israeli head of state was describing his nation\u2019s horror over the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 when the pope issued a blunt rejoinder.</p>\n\n<p>It is \u201cforbidden to respond to terror with terror,\u201d Francis said, according to a senior Israeli official familiar with the call, which has not been previously reported.</p>\n\n<p>Herzog protested, repeating the position that the Israeli government was doing what was needed in Gaza to defend its own people. The pope continued, saying those responsible should indeed be held accountable, but not civilians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Before you pile on the pope. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even his harshest Jewish critics are not suggesting that Francis is trafficking in antisemitism, a scourge he has repeatedly denounced.</p>\n\n<p>As a cardinal in Buenos Aires \u2014 home to one of the world\u2019s largest Jewish populations \u2014 Francis was known to celebrate Jewish holidays with locals, helping to light menorahs during Hanukkah.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, he marked the 50th anniversary of Nostra Aetate \u2014 the Vatican II declaration that sought to remove Biblical-era blame for Jesus\u2019s death on the Jewish people \u2014 with one of the strongest defenses of Israel by a sitting pope. \u201cTo attack Jews is antisemitism, but an outright attack on the State of Israel is also antisemitism,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>More than previous pontiffs, though, the first Latin American pope has also championed human rights, seeing the downtrodden, the underdogs and the oppressed as his primary cause. He reflects the Global South\u2019s general distrust and skepticism of the West and its allies, as well as more sympathetic views toward Palestinians and Russia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article has plenty of quotes from various Jewish leader freaking out about the pope. I don&#39;t think they worth posting here. The pope of course has a large voice that matters in international affairs.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: typo</p>\n</div>",

Oct 7th shifted the goals dramatically - complete collapse and \"dethroning\" of terror orgs, and deterrence means nothing. This means at the very least, something like the military control seen in the WB. No one thinks this would simply end terrorism overnight - they only aim at curbing it to a level currently seen in WB. You'll see the occasional individual terror attack, but nothing that is horrific at the scale seen on Oct 7th.\n\nTo clarify, absolutely no one is \"settled\" on this, but there are definitely attempts and planning, and really everyone in Israel thinks that invasion-and-out is the worst possible solution. I think people assume otherwise because up until now, every other conflict has been like that - just go in, degrade and \"deter\" and get out. But reality as Israelis perceive it changed on Oct 7th in a way that hasn't happened for at least 50 years.

Usually the issue with that has been that really no one steps up to the plate, so the talking point remains as \"well just go easy Israel yeah?\".

KSA is still up for normalization, almost no countries have made a concrete stance against the invasion in any meaningful way, and those that have have functionally 0 impact on Israel.

Thanks for your reply.\n\n______________\nEdit: in addition, it is worth adding that the deranged people Israel has occupying some of the seats in its government are doing a lot of harm. I really don't know how much of an impact they have on military operations. One would hope not much, but really, I do not know, I wonder if others do.\n\nEdit2: I assume it is self evident but just in case, it's worth mentioning - I'm not an expert. I'm just trying my best and am really interested in learning, and really most of what I have to contribute to this place, if anything, is perspective.

Let me know.</p>\n\n<p>3) That is another point I&#39;ve seen mentioned a lot, proportionality etc. Any specific examples come to mind? wherein nominally protected locations were approached heavy handedly for low quality goals / gains?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It just gets drowned out in the finger pointing people prefer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>very true. Thanks for your reply.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit: in addition, it is worth adding that the deranged people Israel has occupying some of the seats in its government are doing a lot of harm. I really don&#39;t know how much of an impact they have on military operations. One would hope not much, but really, I do not know, I wonder if others do.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: I assume it is self evident but just in case, it&#39;s worth mentioning - I&#39;m not an expert. I&#39;m just trying my best and am really interested in learning, and really most of what I have to contribute to this place, if anything, is perspective. Other than that, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m quite ignorant in this field.</p>\n</div>",

The wartime leader so far has defied pressure from the military to sign it.\n> \n> Instead, Zelenskiy last week asked his government and top brass for a more comprehensive package, one better tailored to a nation exhausted by a war and preparing for another winter of fighting. It again put off the blueprint, approved by Ukraine\u2019s parliament, to lower the draft age during war for men with no military experience to 25 from 27.\n> \n> \u201cThe law should have taken effect \u2014 the parliament fully backed it,\u201d Roman Kostenko, a lawmaker on the parliamentary defense committee, said in an interview. \u201cConscription is taking place with difficulty now.\u201d\n> \n> The delay exposes the mounting problem of filling Ukraine\u2019s military ranks almost two years into a conflict that Zelenskiy\u2019s top general says has settled into a standoff. Although Moscow has had its own struggles with conscription, Ukraine\u2019s plight puts it at a potential disadvantage to Russia, a vast nation whose population of 143 million is more than triple that of prewar Ukraine.\n> \n> Zelenskiy\u2019s reluctance to sign the law stems from his wish to see a clear plan for what his military seeks to achieve with a call-up, how new recruits will be deployed and how to design a rotation for those who\u2019ve been on the battlefield for 21 months, according to people familiar with his thinking.   \n>    \n> \n> \u201cI expect a more thorough analysis of each of these issues by both the government and the military and concrete proposals,\u201d Zelenskiy said on Friday after meeting military leaders.\n> \n> But the delay is worrying the military. The legislation would give recruitment officers access to an additional 140,000 potential conscripts, according to military estimates. Ukraine\u2019s popular army chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, wrote in a Nov. 1 essay for The Economist that current conscription rules contained gaps that allow citizens \u201cto evade their responsibilities.\u201d\n> \n> The general referred to a call-up that covers most Ukrainian men between 18 and 60, though provides exemptions for those under 27 without experience in military service, unless they volunteer. The average age for a soldier in Ukrainian army is above 40.\n> \n> Kostenko, 40, who is also fighting in southern Ukraine, said the military is struggling after long queues at recruitment centers last year have dwindled, with volunteer fighters long at the front lines.\n> Sense of Gloom\n> \n> Even as freezing temperatures grip the country, fighting has continued. Russian troops have advanced on the Ukrainian-held city of Avdiivka in the east, while much of the fighting on the southern front in the Zaporizhzhia region \u2013 where Kyiv had aimed to make gains in the summer \u2013 has ground to standstill.\n> \n> Resistance to conscription is also taking shape. In the central Ukrainian city of Poltava, a recruitment drive this year brought in about a 10th of what was targeted, a regional official said. In a case that drew media attention, a man ferrying children to a Taekwondo tournament in Uzhhorod on the Slovak border was seized from his motel room and served call-up papers. Two recruitment officers were charged with beating draft targets in the western city of Ternopil.\n> \n> The government won\u2019t release data on the effectiveness of the call-up.\n> \n> The latest manpower struggle coincides with a sense of gloom settling over Ukraine, with a counteroffensive that\u2019s yielded few results fueling a sense that the war won\u2019t end any time soon. Add to that the prospect of winter missile strikes and anxiety over deliveries from allies and Zelenskiy\u2019s political calculus gets harder.\n> \n> \u201cThe president\u2019s office fears that approval of this law may escalate tensions,\u201d Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta research institute in Kyiv, said. \u201cIt may also boost \u2018peace at any cost\u2019 sentiment. This trend \u2014 though not very popular yet \u2014 is already here and it may intensify.\u201d  \n> \n> Recruitment has had a tortuous history on both sides of the front line, dating at least to social tensions from the Soviet Union\u2019s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, a war that helped precipitate the country\u2019s collapse.\n> \n> President Vladimir Putin has been careful to avoid suggestions that the country plans a new mobilization after hundreds of thousands of Russians fled the country after he announced 300,000 would be drafted into military service in September last year.\n> \n> Opinion polls showed a spike in public alarm among Russians after partial mobilization, as people worried their families may be drawn into the fighting. With Putin likely preparing for a fifth presidential term in an election scheduled for March, officials are playing down speculation that a new drive may be announced after the vote.\n> \n> Kremlin officials set a target of recruiting as many as 400,000 contract soldiers this year. Former President Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy head of Russia\u2019s security council, claimed in October that 385,000 had joined the ranks of the military so far, with as many as 1,600 recruits a day.\n> \n> Russian advertising campaigns lean on calls to patriotism to join up, while topping the offer with relatively high levels of military pay, a figure that can run to three times the average salary.\n> \n> Ukraine\u2019s military authorities have had support for broadening the call-up from allies. Former UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, writing in an op-ed for The Telegraph in October, encouraged Kyiv to enlist more younger men in its aim to win the war, comparing the effort with the Kremlin\u2019s tactics.\n> \n> \u201cI understand President Zelenskiy\u2019s desire to preserve the young for the future,\u201d Wallace wrote. \u201cBut the fact is that Russia is mobilizing the whole country by stealth.\u201d",

Glonass\u2019s shortcomings have \u201cresulted in significant inaccuracy in their advanced weaponry.\u201d\n\n>Russia also uses less-secure commercial-grade GPS signals in frequent attacks on civilian targets.\n\n>A long-delayed effort to fix the constellation is coming too late to help in Ukraine.\n\n>Russia last month launched a rocket carrying a Glonass-K2 satellite, the first installment in a network upgrade projected to cost 484 billion rubles ($5 billion), according to a Janes report.\n\n>First announced for 2018, the launch date kept slipping before liftoff finally took place in early August. It\u2019s the first in what needs to be a years-long effort to improve Glonass. More than half of the constellation\u2019s satellites are already too old, according to Luzin, and with even more satellites approaching their use-by date, Russia will need 20 new ones by the end of the decade, he said.\n\n>\u201cThey are able to produce and orbit just one or two every year because they don\u2019t have the electronics,\u201d said Luzin. \u201cTheir biggest problem is how to save the system itself.\u201d\n\n>Russia has no cutting-edge network of its own. Upgrading the system it does have is expensive, and Roscosmos has suffered from lost revenue since early 2022, when foreign customers such as London-based satellite operator OneWeb canceled plans to use Soyuz rockets to send their satellites into orbit.\n\n>Sanctions, which the US and allies first imposed after the 2014 annexation of Crimea and then expanded after the full-scale invasion last year, have further complicated the Glonass update since the system relies on many foreign components, according to Anna Maria W\u00e5rlind, a specialist in space policy with the Swedish Defence Research Agency.\n\n>\u201cThey\u2019ve struggled to raise their own level of innovation,\u2019 she said in a June podcast released by the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. \u201cFinding substitutes is very challenging for the Russian space program.\u201d\n\n>Russia\u2019s engineers might find short cuts to keep the system operating, albeit at a level that\u2019s less than ideal, said John Klein, a professor at the George Washington University Space Policy Institute. \u201cThey have a long history of making do with the technology they have,\u201d he said.\n\n>Even if Russia eventually manages to address the constellation\u2019s shortcomings, for now they will hinder efforts in the war, said John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonpartisan research institute in Washington.\n\n>Glonass measurements could be off by 10 meters, he added.\n\n>\u201cThat could be the difference between destroying a target and not destroying it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re off by a meter, that might be okay. 10 meters?
