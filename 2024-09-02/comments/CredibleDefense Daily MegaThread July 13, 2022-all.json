        "body": "I have some anecdotal info that might be interesting to you:\n\nI am hosting a Ukrainian refugee and her father is part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. I have talked to her a bit about her father but not to him directly, so we're playing broken telephone here. He is around 50yo and volunteered to join about a month after the Russian invasion, so he had his military experience from the Soviet times when he joined. He is the commander of 27 guys (so I'm guessing a platoon) and I am guessing that he is part of a maneuver unit, because the daughter told me about their unit having old American (Western) armoured \"cars\" (I have settled on that being M113 APCs, since that makes the most sense).\n\nHe has been training for the last 3 months in a base (later forests) somewhere in North-Eastern Ukraine. I don't know what the training consisted of, but she has told me that they haven't used the APCs yet, so most likely it was basic infantry training/refresher. She said that at that there were thousands of other volunteers/recruits at that facility, where he trained for 3 months - I assume 10-20k people but that's just an estimate on what I heard from her. She also told me that the base was hit by cruise missiles 2 or so months ago with hundreds of casualties, which is why they dispersed to the forests to continue training on platoon level.\n\nAbout 10 days ago her father was moved towards southern Ukraine. I don't know how many other soldiers were moved, if it was only the fathers platoon, company or battalion, I just know that their APCs were moved with them, so I imagine at least the company was moved. When I heard that he was being moved I assumed that they would be continuing with their training to focus more on the APCs and using them correctly. \n\nHe was first sent to Marinka, which is the literal frontline and I couldn't believe that, since that would've been reckless and dangerous by his commanders. Fortunately he was sent to Marinka by mistake and his 27-man platoon was pulled back to a staging area much further away from the frontline somewhere in southern Ukraine. I don't know what he is doing there now, haven't had updates from him (via his daughter) for about 4 days.\n\nA few points of interest:\n\n- he had to crowdfund some gear (night-vision, ear-protection etc) through his family and friends. The daughter ran the donation campaign some months ago and he's got it. Although this simply shows that his overall unit is in very poor shape material-wise, since the daughter complained to me about that.\n\n- since he spent 2 days at the frontline, he got a glimpse into the troops stationed there and he said, that they are properly geared, well-trained and experienced.\n\n- currently they are focusing on buying a pickup truck or a similarly capable car for his platoon, due to the father saying that without it they'd have a lot of trouble getting supplies and not enough mobility. I am still trying to understand whether his unit really has such an urgent need for a civilian car but it does make a lot of sense. We're thinking about buying a used car in Germany (since the prices are 3-4 times lower here than in Ukraine) and then driving it to the border for some of the family to pick it up. I'm also thinking if it is possible to crowdfund some donations to take care of that but yeah, it's just an idea currently. \n\n- the Western APCs had a lot of issues right from the start, 30-40% of them required repairs before even being used once.",

He urged EU member states to provide financial guarantees sufficient for the commission to advance a planned \u20ac9bn package to Kyiv.\n\n>  Ukraine\u2019s budget crisis has become acute because of a slump in tax revenues and customs duties since the invasion began almost five months ago together with higher war spending. \n\n> A halt to grain and steel exports has deprived Kyiv of foreign currency earnings. Ukraine is being forced to burn through its foreign exchange reserves at an accelerating pace, as the central bank purchases government bonds to plug its financing gap.\n\n> The G7 and EU have announced official financing commitments to Ukraine worth $29.6bn. According to Dragon Capital, a Kyiv-based investment bank, Ukraine\u2019s allies and international financial institutions have thus far disbursed $12.7bn to the country. \n\n> EU leaders in May pledged additional support of up to \u20ac9bn, on top of a previous \u20ac1.2bn emergency loan; they are still negotiating how to structure that financial support. Officials warn the EU\u2019s full assistance package is unlikely to be settled before the August break. \n\n> Germany in particular has been questioning the idea of providing all of the assistance in the form of loans, diplomats say. Berlin has already contributed bilateral support of \u20ac1bn to Ukraine, and on Tuesday it backed the EU\u2019s additional \u20ac1bn loan.\n\n> The German finance ministry said the commission would put forward a further proposal to reach \u20ac9bn and that as soon as this was available, it would be assessed by the member states. \u201cTogether with our international partners we stand by Ukraine,\u201d it added. \n\n> Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the country now needed $9bn a month from its western backers to plug the budgetary shortfall, almost double its previous request. \n\n> The finance ministry said its assessment of the gap was still $5bn a month but even that was way more than western capitals had so far provided.\n\n> But Ustenko said Ukraine needed an extra $4bn a month for the next three months to cover the cost of emergency accommodation and housing repairs for millions of people and to fund a basic minimum income for people who have lost their jobs. \n\n> \u201cWe will try to survive in any case, but without financial support from our allies it will not only be difficult to do so, it will be next to impossible.\u201d \n\n> The fiscal strains are showing more broadly. Naftogaz, the state-owned energy company, on Tuesday asked holders of $1.5bn of its bonds to accept a delay in payments as it seeks to preserve cash for purchasing gas. It would amount to the first default by a Ukrainian state entity since the war began.\n\n> The Naftogaz move may signal a change of approach by the Ukrainian government to its foreign bondholders. Until now, Kyiv has refused to reschedule its debt payments, saying it was important to maintain the confidence of international investors. \n\n> Ukraine\u2019s central bank said last week that it had used up $2.3bn or 9.3 per cent of its international reserves in June alone, partly because it is monetising the deficit at an increasing pace.\n\n> The National Bank of Ukraine bought $3.6bn worth of government bonds last month, more than double the $1.7bn rate for April and May. The central bank still has enough reserves to cover three months of imports.\n\n> The US on Tuesday announced an extra $1.7bn in direct economic assistance to the government of Ukraine. \u201cThis aid will help\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s democratic government provide essential services for the people of Ukraine,\u201d Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said as she announced the support. \n\n> US international development agency USAID and the Treasury have provided $4bn in direct budgetary support to the Ukrainian government, meaning they are halfway towards the total commitments made under bipartisan legislation.\n\nEdit: May as well ask, what happens if Ukraine doesn't have enough money to meet paying their public finances? And also, what are the chances of Ukraine getting all the billions of Russia's dollar and euro reserves?",

The central bank still has enough reserves to cover three months of imports.</p>\n\n<p>The US on Tuesday announced an extra $1.7bn in direct economic assistance to the government of Ukraine. \u201cThis aid will help\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s democratic government provide essential services for the people of Ukraine,\u201d Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said as she announced the support. </p>\n\n<p>US international development agency USAID and the Treasury have provided $4bn in direct budgetary support to the Ukrainian government, meaning they are halfway towards the total commitments made under bipartisan legislation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Edit: May as well ask, what happens if Ukraine doesn&#39;t have enough money to meet paying their public finances? And also, what are the chances of Ukraine getting all the billions of Russia&#39;s dollar and euro reserves?</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Something that I don't think I've seen mentioned really anywhere, but I think will eventually be everywhere, is just old fashioned flak guns being brought out of storage and updated to shoot drones down. Right now, the main impediment to stopping drones is spotting them in the first place, but I think that in time cheap electronics will proliferate which can do this, even if just through high powered optics or radar.

            "body": "ISTANBUL\u2014Officials from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and the United Nations agreed on key aspects of a plan to resume exports of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, senior Turkish and U.N. leaders said.\n\nAt a meeting in Istanbul, officials from the four parties agreed to establish a coordination center in Istanbul where their representatives would oversee outbound shipments of grain, Turkey\u2019s defense minister said.\nThe understanding is the first concrete breakthrough in weeks of diplomacy led by the U.N. and Turkey aimed at easing a global food crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The fighting has trapped millions of tons of grain in the country, curbing supplies and raising prices on international markets.\n\n\u201cIn a world darkened by global crisis, today at last we have a ray of hope,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters in New York. \u201cToday is an important and substantive step, a step on the way to a comprehensive agreement.\u201d\n\nOfficials said that the talks concluded with an agreement on broad parameters of how grain can again be exported through Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports, but cautioned that any deal still needs to be signed off by Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a Western official.\nOfficials believe this could happen when the Russian leader meets Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan next week in Tehran.\n\nUnder the broad agreement reached Wednesday, grain could ship from three Ukrainian ports in convoys escorted by Ukrainian vessels, with a cease-fire to protect vessels within geographical limits and some minesweeping, a person familiar with the talks said.\nThe Turkish navy would inspect empty ships arriving at Ukrainian ports to address concerns from Russia that the vessels could be used to transport Western arms to Kyiv\u2019s forces. The U.N. will establish a command and control center in Istanbul to monitor threat levels to the shipping.\n\nTechnical details remain to be ironed out, including how mines laid around Ukrainian ports will be cleared, the person familiar with the talks said. Ukraine had originally told the U.N. that a safe passage could be charted through their minefields, but so-called floating mines will also have to be cleared, the Western official said.\n\u201cThe most important thing is, we still need a green light from Putin,\u201d the official said.\n\nA person familiar with the talks said an agreement could be signed in the coming days after some technical details are ironed out, but cautioned, \u201cIt would be wrong to say an agreement is imminent.\u201d\n\nU.N. and Turkish officials have been spearheading the talks, which are aimed at delivering Ukrainian wheat and other essential food products to the international market.\nWednesday\u2019s talks were expected to address some of the technical aspects of the possible grain corridor. Ukraine, meanwhile, is making some progress on export routes that don\u2019t rely on its Black Sea port, though officials and farmers say the route being negotiated on Wednesday is crucial.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in an interview with Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper published on Wednesday that Ukraine and Russia were currently \u201ctwo steps away\u201d from an agreement on the grain corridor. He has said in recent weeks that the two sides must negotiate the full details of any agreement and that the U.N. has a plan \u201cin principle\u201d to establish a grain corridor.\nPrevious attempts to secure a deal on a Black Sea grain corridor have failed in part because Ukraine is reluctant to remove sea mines it says are crucial to defend against a possible Russian naval attack.\n\nA significant portion of the world\u2019s wheat supply has been disrupted as Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports remain blockaded following Russia\u2019s invasion. \n\nUkrainian leaders are demanding security guarantees in return for removing any of their mines and have said that they simply can\u2019t trust Russia not to attack following the full-scale invasion that began in February.\n\nYoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based maritime expert tracking the talks, said at least a couple of weeks of demining would be needed before a corridor could open and minesweepers would be needed to work around the clock on the corridor. He said one solution to Ukraine\u2019s security concerns would be to station a Turkish or Romanian warship near the port city of Odessa.\nOfficials must negotiate a set of challenges, including securing ships from remaining mines and insuring commercial ships navigating the Black Sea. Turkey also has proposed an operations center in Istanbul to oversee the grain corridor. Officials from Russia and Ukraine would need to negotiate the staffing and functioning of the proposed center.\n\n\u201cThe strong position of our military in the Black Sea will allow the return of safe navigation of ships,\u201d Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s chief of staff, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe Russian delegation to the talks \u201csubmitted for consideration a package of proposals for the fastest possible practical solution to this issue,\u201d said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, according to the Russian state news agency TASS. He didn\u2019t provide details about the proposals.\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting is the result of weeks of diplomacy by Turkish, U.N. and Western officials aimed at pushing an agreement forward. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan personally raised the grain issue with the presidents of Ukraine and Russia in separate phone calls on Monday, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office said.\n\nThe stakes of the negotiations are vast, since Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine has already driven up the global cost of food, heaping pressure on poorer nations. Along with blockading six of Ukraine\u2019s 18 ports, Russia has bombed Ukraine\u2019s grain terminals, bridges and other key infrastructure needed to export food to the world.\nMore than 95% of Ukraine\u2019s grain used to be exported through the Black Sea. With that route choked off, the country is exporting less than one-third of what it usually would, through its borders with the European Union and through barges on the Danube that unload onto ships in the Romanian port of Constanta.\n\nWith so much grain left in the country, and a further 30 million metric tons of barley, wheat and other produce expected from the current harvest, Ukraine is running out of places to store its crops. Without proper storage, some of these crops could be lost to rot or insects.\nWhile grain prices have fallen from the levels they reached after Moscow\u2019s invasion, more Ukrainian supplies would bring prices down further at a time of rampant food inflation and acute shortages in parts of the developing world.\n\nMeanwhile, the pace of border processing has increased, enabling Ukraine to export more overland. The country exported two million metric tons of grains in June, below the five to six million tons a month it could send out before to the war but above the 1.5 million in May.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>ISTANBUL\u2014Officials from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and the United Nations agreed on key aspects of a plan to resume exports of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, senior Turkish and U.N. leaders said.</p>\n\n<p>At a meeting in Istanbul, officials from the four parties agreed to establish a coordination center in Istanbul where their representatives would oversee outbound shipments of grain, Turkey\u2019s defense minister said.\nThe understanding is the first concrete breakthrough in weeks of diplomacy led by the U.N. and Turkey aimed at easing a global food crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The fighting has trapped millions of tons of grain in the country, curbing supplies and raising prices on international markets.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn a world darkened by global crisis, today at last we have a ray of hope,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters in New York. \u201cToday is an important and substantive step, a step on the way to a comprehensive agreement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Officials said that the talks concluded with an agreement on broad parameters of how grain can again be exported through Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports, but cautioned that any deal still needs to be signed off by Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a Western official.\nOfficials believe this could happen when the Russian leader meets Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan next week in Tehran.</p>\n\n<p>Under the broad agreement reached Wednesday, grain could ship from three Ukrainian ports in convoys escorted by Ukrainian vessels, with a cease-fire to protect vessels within geographical limits and some minesweeping, a person familiar with the talks said.\nThe Turkish navy would inspect empty ships arriving at Ukrainian ports to address concerns from Russia that the vessels could be used to transport Western arms to Kyiv\u2019s forces. The U.N. will establish a command and control center in Istanbul to monitor threat levels to the shipping.</p>\n\n<p>Technical details remain to be ironed out, including how mines laid around Ukrainian ports will be cleared, the person familiar with the talks said. Ukraine had originally told the U.N. that a safe passage could be charted through their minefields, but so-called floating mines will also have to be cleared, the Western official said.\n\u201cThe most important thing is, we still need a green light from Putin,\u201d the official said.</p>\n\n<p>A person familiar with the talks said an agreement could be signed in the coming days after some technical details are ironed out, but cautioned, \u201cIt would be wrong to say an agreement is imminent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>U.N. and Turkish officials have been spearheading the talks, which are aimed at delivering Ukrainian wheat and other essential food products to the international market.\nWednesday\u2019s talks were expected to address some of the technical aspects of the possible grain corridor. Ukraine, meanwhile, is making some progress on export routes that don\u2019t rely on its Black Sea port, though officials and farmers say the route being negotiated on Wednesday is crucial.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in an interview with Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper published on Wednesday that Ukraine and Russia were currently \u201ctwo steps away\u201d from an agreement on the grain corridor. He has said in recent weeks that the two sides must negotiate the full details of any agreement and that the U.N. has a plan \u201cin principle\u201d to establish a grain corridor.\nPrevious attempts to secure a deal on a Black Sea grain corridor have failed in part because Ukraine is reluctant to remove sea mines it says are crucial to defend against a possible Russian naval attack.</p>\n\n<p>A significant portion of the world\u2019s wheat supply has been disrupted as Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports remain blockaded following Russia\u2019s invasion. </p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian leaders are demanding security guarantees in return for removing any of their mines and have said that they simply can\u2019t trust Russia not to attack following the full-scale invasion that began in February.</p>\n\n<p>Yoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based maritime expert tracking the talks, said at least a couple of weeks of demining would be needed before a corridor could open and minesweepers would be needed to work around the clock on the corridor. He said one solution to Ukraine\u2019s security concerns would be to station a Turkish or Romanian warship near the port city of Odessa.\nOfficials must negotiate a set of challenges, including securing ships from remaining mines and insuring commercial ships navigating the Black Sea. Turkey also has proposed an operations center in Istanbul to oversee the grain corridor.
