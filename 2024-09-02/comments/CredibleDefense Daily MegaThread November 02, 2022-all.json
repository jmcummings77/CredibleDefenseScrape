North Korea is trying to hide the shipments by making it appear as if the ammunition is being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa, the intelligence says.\n\n>The recent intelligence comes about two months after the US intelligence community said that it believed Russia was in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use on the battlefield, CNN and other outlets reported at the time.\n\n>\u201cIn September, the (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea) publicly denied that it intended to provide ammunition to Russia,\u201d the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said in a statement to CNN. \u201c**However, our information indicates that the DPRK is covertly supplying Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine with a significant number of artillery shells**, while obfuscating the real destination of the arms shipments by trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa.\u201d\n\n>Officials did not provide evidence to support the new allegations. The declassified intelligence also did not provide details about how many weapons are part of the shipments, or how they would be paid for.\n\n>\u201cWe will continue to monitor whether these shipments are received,\u201d Kirby said.\n\n>Ongoing effort to resupply Russian artillery\n\n>American officials, however, have publicly touted the alleged deal as evidence that Russia is running out of weapons to continue the war.\n\n>As recently as two weeks ago, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines argued that \u201cexport controls are forcing Russia to turn to countries like Iran and North Korea for supplies, including UAVs, artillery shells and rockets.\u201d\n\n>But the shipments may now help Russia to bolster an important part of its war effort: a grinding artillery fight on the front lines.\n\n>**\u201cIt could be significant development because one of the challenges for Russia has been sustaining artillery fire,\u201d** said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses, who emphasized he had no knowledge of the underlying intelligence. \u201cThe Russian army has likely gone through millions of shells at this point.\u201d\n\n>Russia has been \u201coffsetting a deficit of manpower with much higher output of fires,\u201d Kofman said, a strategy that he said has \u201clikely been very costly on ammunition supplies\u201d and has left Russia, like Ukraine, scouring the globe for countries with Soviet-caliber artillery supplies that are compatible with its systems in order to sustain the war.\n\n>In the weeks before the new intelligence was acquired, some military and intelligence officials were beginning to believe that North Korea was backing away from its agreement to provide weaponry to Russia, multiple officials explained to CNN.\n\n>Some officials had begun to tout it as a victory for the Biden administration\u2019s strategy of selectively declassifying and publicizing some classified intelligence on Russia\u2019s pursuit of the war, believing that when the United States made the deal known, it shed an unwelcome light on a transaction that Pyongyang did not want disclosed.\n\n>But now, US officials say that despite North Korea\u2019s denials, they believe the rogue regime has moved ahead with its support for Moscow as the war appears poised to grind into its second year.\n\n>US officials have argued publicly that Russia has been forced to turn to North Korea and Iran for weaponry both because it has burned through its stockpiles in a conflict that has stretched many months longer than anticipated and because US and western export controls have made it more difficult for Russia to acquire the technological components it needs to rebuild its stocks on its own.\n\n>>\u2018They\u2019re anxious for ammunition anywhere they can get it\u2019\n\n>The new intelligence that Russia is acquiring artillery shells from North Korea suggests that **its shortages run deeper** than just more sophisticated, precision-guided munitions, which US and western officials have long emphasized is a weak point in the Russian arsenal. It also extends to basic artillery.\n\n>\u201cThe Russians, by many accounts, are really wearing thin when it comes to some of those inputs that it needs to prosecute its war on Ukraine,\u201d State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday, pointing to export controls and sanctions that have starved Russia of the inputs to make certain weapons.\n\n>The precise state of Russia\u2019s conventional munitions stocks isn\u2019t publicly known, but Russia is \u201cburning through tens of thousands of rounds a day,\u201d said Adam Mount, the director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists, who specializes in North Korea. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious for ammunition anywhere they can get it.\u201d\n\n>Over the summer, Russia was able to make some grinding progress in parts of Ukraine through a punishing artillery campaign. But since then, western-provided artillery has contributed to a successful counteroffensive push by Ukraine that has retaken large swaths of territory previously held by Russia.\n\n>**North Korea would likely be able to provide Russia with 122- or 152-millimeter artillery shells** and either tube artillery or multiple-rocket-launcher artillery that would be compatible with Russia\u2019s systems, said Bruce Klingner, a former Korea analyst at the CIA who is now at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n>But for now, it\u2019s unclear how impactful North Korea\u2019s artillery shells will be to Russia on the battlefield.\n\n>In 2010, North Korea fired 170 122-millimeter shells at South Korea\u2019s Yeonpyeong Island. **Fewer than half hit the island, and of those, about a quarter failed to detonate \u2013 a high failure rate that** \u201csuggests that some DPRK-manufactured artillery munitions, especially (multiple rocket launcher) rounds, suffer from either poor quality control during manufacture or that storage conditions and standards are poor,\u201d according to a 2016 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n>>\u201cThe last time that they made use of these systems showed that their systems were fairly inaccurate,\u201d Mount said. \u201cYou\u2019d expect these Soviet-era systems are aging so they will start to break down.\u201d",

Some interesting movements. \n\n\u2026\n\nSummary for November 1-2 (until 15:00)\n\n>The situation on the front line\nThe Ukrainian offensive in the Svatovsky direction continues. Having analyzed and geolocated a number of videos, the analyst Def Mon moved the line of action of the Armed Forces of Ukraine even further east.\n\n\n>In the Ugledar direction, Russian forces are advancing south and east of Pavlovka, which is still under the control of Ukraine. A video showing the use of long-range SPGs \"Peony\" (caliber 203 mm) and MLRS appeared in this direction, with which they cover Ukrainian positions.\n\n\n>On November 2, a video of Russian forces shooting incendiary ammunition at Bakhmut appeared. Most likely, these are 9M22S shells for the Grad installation, most often they are used.\n\n>Since, according to our observations, civilians still remain in Bakhmut, the use of incendiary ammunition delivered by air through unsettled urban areas is a war crime, even if the headquarters of Ukrainian troops or some other military facility is located there. Since this is a territory controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there is no doubt that it was Russian forces who committed this crime.\n\n\nMobilization news\n\n>On November 1, Dmitry Peskov said that there would be no decree on the completion of mobilization, as it was not needed, but the mobilization was definitely completed. And some military registration and enlistment offices continue to summon people because of the \"inertia\" effect.\n\n>The head of \"Agora\" Pavel Chikov noted an interesting point: the decree on the announcement of mobilization says that all contracts of military personnel during the mobilization are extended until the end of mobilization. And the mobilized are equated in status to contractors. Accordingly, once the mobilization is completed, all restrictions on dismissals are lifted.\n\n>Pavel Chikov also noted that unlike martial law, which expressly spells out how it is introduced and canceled, such a procedure is not spelled out in the law on mobilization. And there is no term \"demobilization\" in Russian legislation.\n\n>A number of regions have begun to announce the completion of partial mobilization. We expect that there will be new waves of mobilization, since with an increase in the number of personnel of the Russian army, losses inevitably increase, and they need to be compensated.\n\n>Viktor Sobolev, a member of the Defense Committee of the State Duma, did not rule out the introduction of universal mobilization if \"the situation develops negatively.\"\n\n\n>Mobilized from the Bryansk region were outraged that after the draft they were placed in terrible conditions, did not start training, deprived of salaries and even refused to study the terms of the contract. Employees of the local military registration and enlistment office in the village of Klimovo answered them: \"Why do you need a contract? You'll be gone in two weeks!\" Two weeks later, the first obituaries of those mobilized from this military unit did appear.\n\n\n>According to the data department of Novaya Gazeta. Europe\" has already killed at least 100 mobilized, and one in five of them died before reaching the front.\n\n\n>The monitoring group \"Belarusian Gayun\" reports that the approximate number of Russian soldiers arriving in Belarus is 3,600 people. Most of the arrivals are mobilized citizens of the Russian Federation. Presumably, they arrive in Belarus for training, including by Belarusian instructors.\n\n>Another 20 BMP-2s were transferred to Russia. They have already left Belarus towards Lugansk. In general, over the past month, Lukashenko handed over 94 T-72A tanks, 36-44 Ural trucks and 20 BMP-2 to Russia.\n\n\n>There was news about the \"grain deal.\" Ships under the Turkish flag continued to export food from Ukraine, despite the Russian statement to suspend participation in the \"grain deal\". The Russian command did not dare to shell Turkish ships, and there seemed to be not enough resources to build cordons to block the humanitarian corridor.\n\n>On November 2, 3 days after the withdrawal from the \"grain deal\", the Russian Defense Ministry reported that Russia was resuming its participation in it. The reason for this was allegedly that Ukraine provided guarantees for the non-use of these corridors for combat operations against Russia.\n\n\n>Russian forces continue to shell the territory of Ukraine. On the night of November 1, the Dnieper and Poltava were attacked with barrage ammunition, resulting in fires. It is known that at least 4 Shahed-136 drones were hit Poltava, and at least 10 such drones were hit throughout Poltava region, which, according to the head of the OVA Dmitry Lunin, were launched from Gulyaipol.\n\n>According to President Zelensky, Russia has already damaged about 40% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure with such attacks.\n\n\n>The European Union has declared its readiness to supply electricity to Ukraine in the event of a serious shortage, because the electricity shortage affects water supply and heating.\n\n\n>Speaker of the Ukrainian Air Force Yuri Ignat says that it will be difficult to resist the Iranian missiles that may soon be delivered to Russia with the help of the means in service with Ukraine right now.\n\n\n>The United States of America stated that it is conducting an inspection of American weapons in Ukraine to identify or prevent cases of smuggling. At the moment, only one such case is known for sure (a car with an ATGM in the trunk exploded in the Moscow region).\n\n\n>The New York Times publishes information that about 100 Ukrainian servicemen are completing training in working with NASAMS air defense systems in Germany.\n\n\n>There is new information about the attack on Russian ships in Sevastopol Bay. Satellite images of the port of Sevastopol were published, which show two ships built according to project 11356R. According to this project, only three frigates have been built for the Russian fleet: Admiral Grigorovich (he is now in the Mediterranean Sea), Admiral Essen and Admiral Makarov (they are just in the Black Sea).\n\n>The pictures show that one of the frigates is moored with the stern to the pier - most likely he is fine. The other was first pulled by tugs, and then he was moored on the starboard side (just there, according to the videos, and the Ukrainian unmanned boat aimed). Whether there is damage and how large they are, it is impossible to understand from satellite images. This does not follow from the very fact of towing the frigate, but it is quite possible that the frigate is moored in this way for repair (it seems that there is a crane next to it).\n\n\n>Satellite images of the consequences of the helicopter explosion at the Veretye airfield have been published. Two helicopters were destroyed, the third was damaged.\n\n>It should be noted that on October 31, the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine released the news that three helicopters (two Ka-52 and one Mi-28) exploded at the Veretye airfield and two more were damaged. Later it became known that the Mi-28 remained intact and an unfuseable explosive device was found on it. Perhaps Ukrainian intelligence at least knew about the upcoming sabotage.\n\n\n>On October 31, something was burning near the police building again in Kherson.\n\n\n>The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports that the occupation administration of Kherson has been moved to Skadovsk.\n\n\n>On the route Donetsk-Mariupol-Melitopol-Chongar there is active road construction, exploded bridges are being restored. Probably, trucks are still not allowed to pass through the Crimean Bridge.\n\n\n>The headquarters of territorial defense of the DPR reported on the initiation of a criminal case on the preparation for a terrorist attack against Irina Navalnaya, a resident of Mariupol. According to the investigation, she planned to detonate a bomb near the Primorsky district administration building \"in order to disrupt the referendum on the entry of the DPR into the Russian Federation.\"\n\n\n>Prigozhin, answering a question from journalists whether he is afraid that the Governor of St. Petersburg Beglov, in response to Prigozhin's statement to the Prosecutor General's Office, would demand that Prigozhin himself be brought to justice under the article on mercenarism (359 of the Criminal Code), said that \"tens of thousands of [QUOTE TERMINATES HERE IN THE ORIGINAL REPORT. TAKING FROM SOURCE] The founder of Wagner PMC, Prigozhin, who wrote a statement to the Prosecutor General's Office against the governor of St. Petersburg Beglov the day before, said that \"tens of thousands of those same mercenaries are fighting for Mother Russia\" and called on critics to \"shut their mouths.\" So he answered the question of journalists about whether he fears that Beglov in response will demand that he be held accountable under the article on mercenarism (359 of the Criminal Code). \u201cAny comments?

It was created in 2018 by Kiev artist Sasha Korban, and it depicts a girl Milana who was orphaned because of the war in Donbass.

Wonder if that was a result of some combo of the discussion detailed here and back-channel talks with the US.\n\nI know Russia's word means effectively nothing now, but it is notable how, within the last couple weeks, they've emphasized no-offensive-use and the whole \"a nuclear war must never be fought\" rhetoric, had Putin/Lavrov deny plans for a tactical/demonstrative strike, and I believe also the Kremlin also outright spoke out against Kadyrov's calls for nuclear usage. Plus there seems to be an effort to stamp out the nuclear fanfiction that had been going around on Russian TGs.

Here's an Economist article (https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/30/europes-energy-crisis-is-very-far-from-over / https://archive.ph/lSKb7) which generally agrees. They modeled a number of scenarios and none of them look particularly good for Europe. How they will affect Russia is really hard to predict, but it's probably not as much as we would like.\n\n>...\n\n>**Spanners in the spigots**\n\n>We have simulated three scenarios. Even the first, under which relations do not deteriorate, is far from pleasant. It assumes that the Nord Stream pipeline remains shut. It also assumes that Europe follows plans to implement an embargo on Russian crude and prohibit local insurance firms, which have 90% of the global shipping market, from covering vessels carrying Russian oil\u2014albeit with a big exemption. Non-Western buyers that agree to pay a capped price for Russia\u2019s oil, set by America and the eu, are due to be allowed to purchase European insurance.\n\n>For Europe this scenario triggers a crisis but not a catastrophe. Supply cuts mean that by the end of 2022 the continent will have missed out on 84bn cubic metres (bcm) of Russian gas, equivalent to 17% of its normal annual consumption. Higher lng imports have already plugged part of this hole, a smaller chunk is filled by greater piped flows from Azerbaijan and Norway, and another by painful but voluntary consumption cuts. Our simulation suggests that\u2014even if the winter turns frigid, boosting demand by 25 bcm\u2014Europe\u2019s storage will allow it to get through the summer of 2023, by which point lng imports may start to ramp up further.\n\n>Under this scenario, governments will not have to ration gas. Europe will, though, have to pay dearly for it. As Namit Sharma of McKinsey, another consultancy, notes, high prices have already led to shutdowns in energy-hungry industries, such as aluminium and ammonia. If Nord Stream remains shut for the whole of next year, Europe\u2019s energy deficit will widen, requiring even bigger cuts in consumption. Gavekal, a research firm, estimates that a 1% drop in energy consumption in Germany or Italy reduces gdp by 0.5-1%.\n\n>It is hard to gauge the cost of this scenario for Russia. Its piped exports to Europe, already down by four-fifths, cannot easily be sold elsewhere. Its pipeline to China, the only serious alternative, is too puny to handle big flows. However the price for what it is able to sell would be much higher.\n\n>In theory, the eu\u2019s dual oil embargoes, coupled with a price cap, are a more potent threat to Russia\u2019s oil exports, the country\u2019s real money-maker. But we assume, as the market does, that the cap will be watered down, and that Russia will find buyers for many of the barrels it is unable to sell to Europe. Western officials are leaning towards a loosely policed cap set at near $60 a barrel. Since our base case expects global prices to stay below $90, that would not make much difference to the price of Russian oil, which currently trades at a 20-30% discount.\n\n>This explains why, in such a scenario, Russia still pockets $169bn in oil revenues in 2023, barely less than the $179bn it earned in 2021. It and other market participants must still incur the increased transaction costs caused by longer tanker journeys, smuggling shenanigans and other frictions. Europe pays a hefty price. Importing Russian seaborne barrels cost it $90bn in 2021. The replacement of these in 2023 would cost $116bn.\n\n>...",

Higher lng imports have already plugged part of this hole, a smaller chunk is filled by greater piped flows from Azerbaijan and Norway, and another by painful but voluntary consumption cuts. Our simulation suggests that\u2014even if the winter turns frigid, boosting demand by 25 bcm\u2014Europe\u2019s storage will allow it to get through the summer of 2023, by which point lng imports may start to ramp up further.</p>\n\n<p>Under this scenario, governments will not have to ration gas. Europe will, though, have to pay dearly for it. As Namit Sharma of McKinsey, another consultancy, notes, high prices have already led to shutdowns in energy-hungry industries, such as aluminium and ammonia. If Nord Stream remains shut for the whole of next year, Europe\u2019s energy deficit will widen, requiring even bigger cuts in consumption. Gavekal, a research firm, estimates that a 1% drop in energy consumption in Germany or Italy reduces gdp by 0.5-1%.</p>\n\n<p>It is hard to gauge the cost of this scenario for Russia. Its piped exports to Europe, already down by four-fifths, cannot easily be sold elsewhere. Its pipeline to China, the only serious alternative, is too puny to handle big flows. However the price for what it is able to sell would be much higher.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, the eu\u2019s dual oil embargoes, coupled with a price cap, are a more potent threat to Russia\u2019s oil exports, the country\u2019s real money-maker. But we assume, as the market does, that the cap will be watered down, and that Russia will find buyers for many of the barrels it is unable to sell to Europe. Western officials are leaning towards a loosely policed cap set at near $60 a barrel. Since our base case expects global prices to stay below $90, that would not make much difference to the price of Russian oil, which currently trades at a 20-30% discount.</p>\n\n<p>This explains why, in such a scenario, Russia still pockets $169bn in oil revenues in 2023, barely less than the $179bn it earned in 2021. It and other market participants must still incur the increased transaction costs caused by longer tanker journeys, smuggling shenanigans and other frictions. Europe pays a hefty price. Importing Russian seaborne barrels cost it $90bn in 2021. The replacement of these in 2023 would cost $116bn.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

            "body": "Europe should be okay this heating season. 2023 is where attention will turn to soon. A few points:\n\n1. Most fundamentally, Europe has relied on Russian gas flows to the point that regasification terminals for LNG and storage capacity have lagged consumption considerably. They are working on this, but it takes time. Especially storage facilities. If you can\u2019t rely on pipelines, you need almost 30-40% more storage than many of these countries have, the Dutch being the only real exception. For some, like Poland, you need at least twice as much storage capacity for winter months (these are my own estimates). You can consolidate storage in one central location, but that requires a lot of trust and cooperation.\n\n2. Europe has continued to purchase gas predominantly in the spot market instead of inking more long-term contracts (they have done a couple, but not enough.) Some of this was understandable, especially in the August/September period, when suppliers were demanding insane terms for 20-30 year contracts. In the oil market, spot-buying works because 70%+ of the oil market works on spot, or near spot, pricing. In LNG, only ~30% of the market currently operates on spot. This will change with time, but not quickly enough for Europe. LNG trains require heavy capex and producers and their financiers want reliable future cash flows. The EU needs to start signing more long-term contracts. \n\n3. China has been reselling a lot of gas to Europe this year because of COVID zero and a general economic slowdown. It\u2019s very hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen in China next year, but if they return to close to norm, not only will that Chinese supply disappear, they\u2019ll be competing directly with Europe for shipments of LNG in the spot market. That\u2019s not only going to push up prices, it\u2019s also going to increase volatility. And increased volatility has a way of pushing up costs in their own way, mostly by banks from and through  physical traders asking for more collateral from both buyers and sellers. \n\n4. There are technical issues, such as contango, which means future prices are higher than spot prices. This encourages some physical traders to delay or hold shipments of gas in ships, in the hopes that spot prices will eventually catch up. This exacerbates gas tightness because things like cold fronts and polar chills are hard to predict. Normally, wouldn\u2019t be a huge deal, but because of problem 1, this problem is amplified. If everyone is holding back their ships for prices to rise (like they are currently) then any sudden increase in prices means all these ships want to berth, but the physical port infrastructure for regasification is a bottle neck. \n\n5. All of this would be considerably more manageable if Germany would have embraced nuclear. Renewables aren\u2019t good for dealing with spiked demand, and coal is\u2026But, even if there were an abrupt change of heart on this issue, these plants take years, sometimes decades, to build and commission. I\u2019m not an expert on nuclear, and other people can opine more, but along with nuclear, the EU also needs a significant better electricity pricing system than the current one. There\u2019s been work on this front, and the EU will get there eventually. \n\nAll in all though, despite all these issues, I personally remain optimistic on 2023 if countries and leaders do what\u2019s required of them. The problems are known, and the solutions are too. Some of them are more long-term, but most can be solved within the year.",

Feel free to read if you\u2019re planning on buying a helicopter anytime soon.)\n\n-Complexity\n\nWith their rotors, engines, blades, transmissions, and fuel control systems, helicopters are very complex machines that require a great deal of research and engineering to design as well as possible. Due to this complexity, it isn\u2019t as easy to automate production that would lower production costs.\n\n-Maintenance\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that the maintenance and repairs of owning a car cost an average of $0.09 per mile. Helicopter maintenance is far more specialized with a helicopter\u2019s major components like its engines and rotor systems requiring compulsory inspection at specific intervals. Other parts may also need to be regularly inspected, maintained, and perhaps replaced.\n\n-Fuel Efficiency\n\nThe amount it costs to fuel a helicopter is dependent on three things: the size of the helicopter\u2019s gas tank, the type of gas the helicopter uses, and the price of the fuel.\n\nHelicopters and airplanes use the same type of gas and fuel. This is either Avgas for piston-powered engines or Avtur for turbine-powered engines. So there is no difference there.\n\nBut a helicopter is far more expensive to run due to the nature of its design whereby all of its lift comes from its rotors. A helicopter also travels at slower speeds and can burn through a lot of fuel as it hovers, both of which impact fuel economy and efficiency.",

Spotting would also be difficult, but typically there seems to be some degree of warning before a strike and I imagine that Ukraine air controllers have a general idea of the direction that these drones are coming from. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a crazy idea, but I&#39;ve always been interested in out-of-the-box ad hoc solutions to war time challenges.</p>\n</div>",
