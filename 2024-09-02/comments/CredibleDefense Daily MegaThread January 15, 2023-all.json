        "body": "With most commenters on this sub evidently American, and the renewed focus on German defence policy after 24.02.2022, I thought I'd type out a quick explainer of what's going on with the German minister of defence's resignation.\n\n**What happened?**\n\nToday Christine Lambrecht (Social Democratic Party) tendered her resignation as German minister of defence, after about 14 months in the office. The story of her intention to do so had already broken on Friday, and did not come as much of a surprise.\n\n**Why did she resign?**\n\nLambrecht's tenure had been rocky from the start. A minister of justice as well as family affairs under Merkel, with a massive loss of her own party looming in the 2021 federal election she had already announced her retirement from politics in 2020 when the SPD's surprise election victory evidently changed her mind and she was appointed minister of defence under Scholz.\n\nFrom the very start reports emerged of a fundamental lack of work ethics, and disinterest in her new department. She declined to attend the intensive one week introduction all incoming ministers of defence get in order to get them up to speed with the department. She refused to learn the military's basic rank structure. She turned down a meeting her British colleague Ben Wallace had urgently requested because she preferred to go on holiday instead. \n\nOne of her first moves as minister had been to attempt to sideline the Bundeswehr's Generalinspekteur (the German equivalent to the US' Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) and have him report to an undersecretary instead of to her directly, and by the time she resigned she had yet to meet all of the six heads of the armed force's branches - after more than a year in office.\n\nBut more so than her general incompetence and work ethics it seems to have been her disastrous publicity work that finally caught up to her - her announcement of delivering 5,000 helmets to Ukraine as a *'very clear signal'* of German support for Ukraine in the run-up to the invasion made her a target of national and international ridicule. Her son posting pictures of him travelling on a Bundeswehr VIP helicopter with his mother to visit troops in Northern Germany, just to immediately continue on to a private beach vacation close-by afterwards, while not technically illegal, left a bitter aftertaste. \n\nFinally, the last drop came when shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve she posted a personal new year's video message, talking about the great challenges of the past year and stating that *'Once again, war rages in Europe'* ...  to the backdrop of fireworks and people cheering and celebrating.\n\nOverall a picture of Lambrecht remains of a politician who, already on the way out, was gifted with a ministry she saw as a calm posting on the road to retirement, and when suddenly presented with a crisis that returned the Bundeswehr to the centre of attention and made its reformation a top priority, was completely out of her depth.\n\n**Who is next?**\n\nNo successor has been announced so far, but various names are making the rounds.\n\nAn audience favourite throughout the past year has been [Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Agnes_Strack-Zimmermann) (Free Democratic Party). Elected to parliament in 2017 she has since served as chairwoman of the Defence Committee as well as a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Since the start of the Russian invasion she has been a strong voice in favour of heavy weapons deliveries, including MBTs, making her popular amongst many that are in favour of more substantial military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe main reason Strack-Zimmermann is unlikely to be named to the position is her party membership - in the current three-party coalition the SPD holds the MoD, and will continue to do so unless a major reshuffle occurs, which is unlikely.\n\nA more realistic choice may be [Eva H\u00f6gl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_H%C3%B6gl) (SPD), parliament's Armed Forces Commissioner (even though curiously she is not currently serving as an MP). H\u00f6gl recently flouted the idea of the Bundeswehr's 'special fund' being increased from the current \u20ac100 bn. to around \u20ac300 bn., a number she claims experts within and outside the Bundeswehr have cited as more realistic in order to overcome the armed force's major current deficiencies.\n\nAnother person in the running is [Siemtje M\u00f6ller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemtje_M%C3%B6ller) (SPD). As the current parliamentary state secretary in the MoD she is intimately familiar with the ministry's and Bundeswehr's internal workings and has been part of the current effort to 'take stock' of what is needed to reform the armed forces.\n\nAdditional candidates are Lars Klingbeil (SPD party leader), Hubertus Heil (SPD, currently employment and social affairs minister) and Wolfgang Schmidt (SPD, currently head of the chancellery). In 2021 the incoming government made a commitment of gender parity though (one that the leader of the Green party just called to be maintained), making the appointment of a man somewhat less likely.\n\nWhatever the future holds, it is hard not to imagine that Lambrecht's successor will be a major improvement.",

        "body": "ISW posted their daily update. It\u2019s a Sunday abbreviated version. They discuss mid term Russian strategy around force preparation.\n\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-15-2023\n\nHere is their daily events summary:\n\nKey inflections in ongoing military operations on January 15:\n\nUkrainian officials specified that a Russian Kh-22 missile struck a residential building in Dnipro City on January 14, killing at least 25\u201330 civilians. Ukrainian officials clarified inaccurate reporting that Ukrainian air defenses may have caused the destruction to the building, noting that Ukraine does not have the capability to shoot down Kh-22 missiles.\n\nWagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin awarded medals to Wagner Group forces for the capture of Soledar, likely in an ongoing effort to frame the capture of Soledar as a Wagner accomplishment rather than a joint effort with the Russian Armed Forces, as the Russian Ministry of Defense previously claimed.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground assaults near Makiivka and Bilohorivka, Luhansk Oblast. A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are transferring Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) off-road vehicles from Russia to Luhansk Oblast, possibly for use in combat.\n\nRussian sources claimed that Russian forces finished clearing Soledar and attacked Ukrainian positions to the north, west, and southwest of the settlement.

Ukrainian officials clarified inaccurate reporting that Ukrainian air defenses may have caused the destruction to the building, noting that Ukraine does not have the capability to shoot down Kh-22 missiles.</p>\n\n<p>Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin awarded medals to Wagner Group forces for the capture of Soledar, likely in an ongoing effort to frame the capture of Soledar as a Wagner accomplishment rather than a joint effort with the Russian Armed Forces, as the Russian Ministry of Defense previously claimed.</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground assaults near Makiivka and Bilohorivka, Luhansk Oblast. A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are transferring Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) off-road vehicles from Russia to Luhansk Oblast, possibly for use in combat.</p>\n\n<p>Russian sources claimed that Russian forces finished clearing Soledar and attacked Ukrainian positions to the north, west, and southwest of the settlement. A Ukrainian source reported that Russian forces captured a mine west of Soledar near Dvorichchia on January 15. </p>\n\n<p>Russian forces continued to attack Bakhmut and areas to the north, east, south, and southwest of the city.</p>\n\n<p>Russian forces made marginal territorial gains southwest of Bakhmut near Andriivka.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Military Advisor Serhiy Khlan stated that Russian forces increased their presence in occupied Kherson Oblast and that some Wagner Group forces arrived in Kherson Oblast.

However, the building does seem to match.\n\nThe way I'm deducing that it is not going at a very high supersonic is that the time between the first flash and the first boom as well as the time between the impact being seen (assuming that the impact happens as soon as we lose sight of the building) and the second boom is 2.5 seconds and then 5 seconds.\n\nSince the flash is seen at 0:02 in the video and the impact cannot be before 0:05 seconds while the difference in time it takes to arrive is 2.5-3 seconds, we can deduce that the missile didn't travel much more than 3 sound-seconds in 2.5-3 seconds. Therefore, the missile would have to be travelling at around the speed of sound, and not at its Mach 3-5 sprint speed. \n\nIn reality, this technique will slightly underestimate the speed of the missile because the angle of the missile to the observer is not constant across time. However, this is going to be negligible due to the altitude of the missile being much smaller than the distance it travels. We can expect an error of 5-15% from this. \n\nThis is assuming that the missile was not behind the observer at the time of the first flash. This is quite unlikely if the flash was somehow related to the missile, and we would then expect to hear a sonic boom much later as the missile goes forwards which isn't the case. If the sonic boom was the first sound heard after the flash, then the missile would have travelled from it's position as the sonic boom hit - which must have been between the observer and the building - all the way to the building in 2 seconds or so. The building being not more than 4 sound-seconds away from the observer and the difference in time between the two sounds being around 6-7 seconds, we can conclude that if the first boom was a sonic boom, then the missile travelled not more than 4 sound-seconds in 3-5 seconds. \n\nIf it really is a Kh-22, then for it to be flying this slow it must have been damaged somehow, though I don't see how it could realistically happen. The Kh-22 is not supposed to be flying at subsonic speeds in any part of it's flight profile. I personally think it was another kind of missile.",

Where is this massive number of uncommitted officers and support troops coming from? The last time they tried to replicate a single new corps, 3rd, it took months to wrangle up officers from everywhere. To recreate Operation Z invasion means needing a dozen operational units, plus recreating all the enabler units (fires, logistics, C4I). \n\nWe've heard that they've organized the Mobiks in regiments, but are there any reports of new operational commands stood up?

If you believe others it's because of supply woes, HIMARS, etc. Why fires are limited doesn't even really matter, what matters is the Russian army was always a fires centric force, then became more reliant on them as quality plummeted due to losses and positional warfare became the norm, but without heavy flow of available artillery ammo, they can't attack on a broad front. \n\n- The initial invasion was only possible at all because UA weren't ready, denied permission to go to alert and mobilize, with almost no manned prepared defenses outside the JFO. That's been corrected, big time. Any invasion they start is going to be major positional warfare on a broad front with necessary C4I, support units, and logistics they don't gain because of a partial mobilization that started in mid to late September.\n\n- Where are they going to attack in order to be as big as the initial invasion?

They are still on the attack in Bakhmut and west of Donetsk city, they'll need Mobiks to keep those offensives going We already know the MOD are not cool with using Wagner and other PMC to take over the war effort, Mobiks are their way around needing to rely on Wagner. \n\n- SMD and EMD in the south still need to heavily reinforce so there are no more September Kharkiv like weak points that the UAF can exploit with future offensives against Melitopol, Mariupol, or an assault river crossing of the Dnieper. With the Mobiks, Russia can reinforce sectors at will, in depth, without \"robbing Peter in order to pay Paul.\" How about also taking the steps to start building and manning defenses in Crimea? Need Mobiks for that too. \n\n- They can help stabilize their force suffering other manpower issues. Not enough truck drivers it mechanics? Not enough dismounted infantry overall? That can be fixed with Mobiks.\n\n- How about rotating combat troops off the line who have been in balls-to-the-wall meat grinder warfare since late February and after, to get them out of the combat zone for extended periods so they can be rested for months to years, or even discharged?

A lot of their better tanks, IFV, SPG, etc. A lot of their digital radio comms that were lost. Radars lost. EW systems lost. Precision guided munitions expended. Etc. They have manufacturing capabilities to replace everything in time, but not from Sep-Apr. They only have what they have in stock that's ready, and its not very impressive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Russian issue of competent officers is a bigger issue, but also addressable.\n\nAlso not addressable in the near term. They can't just create tens of thousands of field grade officers and expect them to know what they're doing. Or potentially just doing it without assuming they will know what they're doing, at best they could mass promote a significant number of their existing company grades to field grades (everyone gets bumped 1-3 paygrades), but then that creates an even larger shortage of company grade officers that can't be refilled because they can't suddenly dramatically increase the number of those either. Is there a large number of high quality NCOs they can battlefield promote? Nope. Do they have fully functioning OCS type schools set up in every military district to pump out \"90 day wonders\"? Nope, they barely have enough officers in the rear just to train their own junior enlisted troops. They literally were cannibilizing the officer candidate academies to use as trainers for the junior enlisted, which shows how over committed they are in that regards.   \n\nAnd they can't follow their own doctrine without those officers. From what I've read, they are having to abolish battalions as a tactical formation, making brigades or regiments a collection of companies with no command echelon in between. All because they don't have enough company and field grade officers to run the command and staff at the battalion level.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>There will not be a repeat of February last year, but I do strongly think that Russia will extend the front with at least one additional axis of attack, possibly more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree the Russians will want to launch an offensive to retake part of what they lost, but what I replied to was the sensationalist statement of <em>&quot;the spring attack could be larger than what Ukraine faced at the start of the war, again targeting multiple regions at once.&quot;</em> So that twitter &#39;tard imagines something even bigger than last February. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Russian issue of hardware is addressable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To an extent, but there are lots of hardware items they&#39;ve lost and can&#39;t replace anytime soon. A lot of their better tanks, IFV, SPG, etc. A lot of their digital radio comms that were lost. Radars lost. EW systems lost. Precision guided munitions expended. Etc. They have manufacturing capabilities to replace everything in time, but not from Sep-Apr. They only have what they have in stock that&#39;s ready, and its not very impressive. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Russian issue of competent officers is a bigger issue, but also addressable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also not addressable in the near term. They can&#39;t just create tens of thousands of field grade officers and expect them to know what they&#39;re doing. Or potentially just doing it without assuming they will know what they&#39;re doing, at best they could mass promote a significant number of their existing company grades to field grades (everyone gets bumped 1-3 paygrades), but then that creates an even larger shortage of company grade officers that can&#39;t be refilled because they can&#39;t suddenly dramatically increase the number of those either. Is there a large number of high quality NCOs they can battlefield promote? Nope. Do they have fully functioning OCS type schools set up in every military district to pump out &quot;90 day wonders&quot;? Nope, they barely have enough officers in the rear just to train their own junior enlisted troops. They literally were cannibilizing the officer candidate academies to use as trainers for the junior enlisted, which shows how over committed they are in that regards.   </p>\n\n<p>And they can&#39;t follow their own doctrine without those officers. From what I&#39;ve read, they are having to abolish battalions as a tactical formation, making brigades or regiments a collection of companies with no command echelon in between. All because they don&#39;t have enough company and field grade officers to run the command and staff at the battalion level. And that is INSANE, and yet its how they&#39;re adopting out of necessity in order to sustain limited scale set piece offensives, but without a battalion command echelon, maneuver warfare is out of the question. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is still a pool of late-Soviet (massively bloated) officer corps relatively alive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, the Cold War ended 30 years ago, anyone who was a major back then, roughly 30 years old, would be in their 60s now.

At no point so far has Ukraine received close to the amount they have asked for, regarding any weapons system. Zaluzhnyi has talked about 300 MBTs, but that in no way means that Western countries will scramble to actually get him 300 - at least not in the short term, or in one imminent announcement. 100 to 200 is far more likely, and then a further trickle in the future.\n\nAs for Leopards: there won't be more than 150 or so without some major political shifts. Many countries can throw in a couple, but to get to even close to 200 the biggest operators would need to send several dozens each. Those are - from memory and not in order - Turkey, Greece, Germany, Spain and Poland.\n\nTurkey and Greece are very, very unlikely to contribute any (Turkey hasn't supported Ukraine much in general, Greece feels threatened by Turkey), Germany struggles with even keeping enough of them running for their own operations, Spain hasn't contributed much to Ukraine either, and those they have in storage seem to be in terrible condition (remember the early summer thing), and Poland has already contributed most of its T-72 fleet.\n\nSo in order for Ukraine to get the necessary number of Leopards, something would have to change fundamentally regarding these countries.\n\nThat could be:\n\na) The US accelerating Abrams deliveries to Poland, and already sending US army tank units to Poland to cover the flank as well as start training more Polish forces on Abrams, in exchange for Poland sending most of their Leopards to Ukraine.\n\nb) Someone (probably the US again) guaranteeing Greece's security against Turkey. But with Turkey needed to keep the Straits closed, as well as their general position in NATO and obstruction of Sweden's and Finland's accession, I cannot see anyone wanting to antagonise them that much.\n\nTo add to that, except Poland and Turkey I am not aware of any of the other countries planning to replace their Leopard 2 fleet soon. So it's not like their donations could be somehow backfilled soon by something appropriate. And KMW, as we all know, is building Leopards more on an artisanal than an industrial scale.",

The Leo2 claim should give away he was full of shit. \n\nAs I recall from these daily threads, the initial spearhead hit open air, basically nothing was infront of them and they were able to crumble the front line rapidly. This led to a period of maneuver in which Russian forces were caught out of fixed positions, engaged, and routed out of key positions like Izium. Only around Lyman did Ukraine encounter firm positions, the eastern suburbs of Lyman fell on Sept 10th, but the city itself didnt fall until Oct. 1st. This was because, as Russia understood the gravity of the northern collapse, they began to rotate units from Bakhmut northward. They created a strongpoint which Ukraine had to assault and capture. This happened, with potentially significant losses for Russia. However, the second battle for Lyman gave Russia sufficient time to rebalance itself and stiffen defenses around the rest of the Luhansk border. Recognizing this, Ukraine hoped to push north along the Svatove line where it initially seemed like the Russian line was weaker. However, Russian forces were able to continue to deploy forces to counter attack Ukrainian positions forcing them back into stalemate. This coincided with the first influx of Mobiks, the untrained two day wonders. Despite an initially negative assessment these bodies seem to have been used to plug gaps in the Russian line. These men definitely went south to Kherson, some went into Bakhmut, and an unknown number must have been used to stiffen positions outside of Svatove and Lysychansk. At that point, the Ukrainian forces had been fighting hard battles for about a month and had been counterattacked heavily. They were in need of refit. While Russian forces were surging strength. This created a natural transition for an offensive battle to an operational pause which is what were seeing now. Potentially.

            "body": "IDK about NYC, but I cant think of any off the top of my head. I would imagine that most global finance firms are going to have teams, or 3rd party consultants, writing reports on global conditions. IDK how satisfying that would be, and I'm not sure someone like eg. Goldman Sachs hires many of these types a year. I know a few people who did (before COVID) contract writing for this website that catered to the business community. They would right weekly security updates about places where business conditions could be impacted.

Or do you doubt the number of 300k mobilized in the first wave?\n\nYes, I do think some did went home. That's what happens when you tell local officers that they need to fill their quota of mobilisation without having the proper infrastructure and personal to train those mobiks. \n\nAlso, we know for a fact that a not insignificant number of people where mobilized despite being ineligible, which caused a lot of backlash, leading to Putin himself assuring the Russian public that those cases would be corrected. So there are at least some people who were incorrectly mobilized that we know for sure we're sent back home. \n\nBut none of that is why I'm skeptical about Russia having 200k mobiks in training, as those are likely outliers and probably account for a small number of mobiks. The real reasons why I'm skeptical are: \n\n1. The 300k number. There's no reason to believe Russia did actually mobilize all those man. Fudging the numbers is baked into the DNA of Russian officers. Being under pressure to fill quotas only increases the likelihood of that happening systematically.\n\n2. Lack of infrastructure and training. It takes more than dragging man off the street and sending them to a random military depot to get real soldiers. Training 200k mobiks to any real standard would require huge amounts of resource and expertise, which Russia is almost sure to lack right now. \n\n3. The political reality. It took Putin 8 months (IIRC) to finalize order the first wave of mobilisation. There's no way they'd be preparing a new wave if they truly had 200k trained soldiers ready to go to the front. \n\n4. The home front. Many people seem to have forgotten it, but back when Russia mobilized, multiple Russian officials said that many mobiks wouldn't be going to Ukraine, but actually stay in Russia to reconstitute units severely depleted by the war (and to free up experienced man from those units to go to Ukraine). \n\n5. The source. I'm yet to see a credible source for the 200k number, with the most high-profile source being none other than Putin himself. Color me cynical, but if that's what he's told by his aides, than the real number is probably much lower. If it was 200k, they'd tell him it was 400k. \n\nAll that said, do I think it's impossible that Russia truly has 200k highly trained mobiks being held back? No. Do I think it's likely?

However, both videos and ground photos have been missing for many months, and only sometimes information about new supplies leaks to the media. So, five days ago, a report appeared on the delivery of 8 Orion complexes with 6 drones in each during the war, i.e. 48 vehicles, of which only 2 were reliably lost at Oryx.

Foreign media in English is hardly accessible to most Russians due to lack of language skills. Russian independent media is blocked and requires a VPN to access, which is not an easy thing to install for most people.
