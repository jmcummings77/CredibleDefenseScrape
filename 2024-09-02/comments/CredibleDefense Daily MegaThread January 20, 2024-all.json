Russia has always worked under the assumption that Ukraine will never gain the ability to do deep strikes, they worked under those assumptions when they put hundreds of ammo depots a few dozens km form the frontline. \n\nThose ammo depots started cooking one after the other when Ukraine received Himars, the VKS works under the same assumption, they concentrated dozens of helicopters at a single base and even though they received plenty of public warnings that Ukraine was about to receive ATACMS they only started dispersing their helicopters when they lost between 9-21 helicopters in a single strike.\n\nThe VKS still works under the same assumption, they put dozens of Su34s in lines and don't even bother building hangars for them. The same is true from Russia's military production facilities, they are neither hidden nor dispersed because they have been working under the assumption that Ukraine will never be able to strike them.\n\nThe Black Sea fleet worked under the same assumption during the entirety of the war and has payed the biggest price out of all of them. When Russia pulled out of the Grain corridor they started a  sizeable strike campaign against Odessa, they launched hundreds of missiles to try and stop Ukraine's exports. When Ukraine announced a blockade of the Black Sea I remember a lot of users here laughing about the Idea claiming they didn't have the capabilities, but here we are, not only are Ukraine's exports back to pre-war level they were able to destroy 20% of the Russian Balck Sea fleet. \n\nAll the capabilities that permitted those strikes will only grow with time with the exception of Storm shadows, but we know Ukraine has invested a serious amount of money in their own missile program and at some point it will come online. \n\nThe point is that Russia has never been proactive, they have always waited until disaster struck to start and change their way of doing war, it has thus left the entirety of Russia's military production apparatus completly vulnerable to long range strikes.\n\n\n> It's Ukraine that's being destroyed,\n\nYou are right but if we look at all of Russia's strategic bombing campaigns, they all have been without exception terrible failures. The opening salvo failed to destroy ukriane's air defense, the campaign against electrical infrastructure failed to achieve anything and they expended almost the entirety of their stockpile on that, the campaign against Odessa to try and stop Ukraine's exports was an even worse failure and the current campaign will probably end like all the others.",

        "body": "Quick update on the stuff that wasn't clarified (as we had not details yet) in my yesterday's post about the tactical developments in Ukraine.\n\nDeepState in tonight's update seems to have confirmed that the former restaurant \"Tsarska Ohota\" in Avdiivka has passed into Russian hands. It's strange that the Russians have not posted a video from there or hoisted their flag there, as they usually do in these instances: it's possible that there is close fighting in the area. Russian sources report the presence of the former PMC (now \"assault and reconnaissance brigade\") \"Veterans\" there. The area of the holiday cottages in Skotovata is a grey area, while the Russians have reportedly fully occupied the dachas in the vineyard area, south of the industrial zone, as well as the small quarry west of it. This certainly complicates the situation for the Ukrainians in the south of the city - the former restaurant was a very important stronghold. This doesn't mean that the Russians will now have it easy. Fortunately, it seems (I repeat, it seems) that the Russian presence in the private sector along Soborna Street were mostly a few recon-in-force teams that got there due to the fact that they were not detected and there should be no stable Russian presence in that area. It's possible that the Ukrainian lines now start around the first houses in the private sector. After all, the Russians captured the industrial zone (Promka) almost two months ago and have so far been unable to advance along the private sector of Yasynovskyi Lane. The Ukrainians should also have some trenches before Lisna Street, heading north-east from the former restaurant.\n\nThis, however, gives the Russians more tactical space to move against the city's urban core and also could complicate matters for the future holding of the area known as \"Cheburashka\" (i.e. the junction between T-05-05 Road and the unfinished Donetsk ring road) and the nearby former anti-aircraft missile regiment base known as \"Zenith\", two other important Ukrainian strongholds north of Spartak. In addition, DeepState reported that the Russians advanced about 700 meters halfway between the Avdiivka Sand Quarry (i.e. the big lake north-east of the city) and the H20 Road along the Kamianka creek - there are some dachas in the area. Russian sources were giving this area as being already under their control for a while already. Anyway, fortunately, that area is the valley of the creek and is at a low altitude, while to the south-east of the Sand Quarry there is a terrikon in Ukrainian hands that allows them to dominate the course of the Kamianka creek. \n\nThere are also updates from the Kupyansk sector, where DeepState had reported, the day before yesterday, that there had been a breakthrough of Ukrainian positions (held by the 103rd TDF Brigade), in the area between Tabaivka and Krokhmalne. The Russians managed to break through the Kupyansk-Svatove railway, which the Ukrainians were defending and which is located on high ground, relative to the area to the east and west. Today stormtroopers of the \"new\" 153rd Tank Regiment of the 47th Tank Division (1st GTA) posted a photo from inside the settlement of Krokhmalne. Tonight DeepState clarified the situation. The Russian breakthrough was significant: they advanced for a length of 2 to 3 kms in a 6 kms long sector, occupying Road P07 in the area, with a gain of around 13 square kilometers. The biggest problem here is the elevation: having passed the heights that run where the railroad passes, the Russians have descended along the ridges of the Pischana creek's valley and are now approaching the creek (which passes inside Tabaivka), enjoying an elevation advantage. Here too, the situation is not dramatic. The Pischana is a tributary of the Oskil and has its source just before Tabaivka. The valley it forms is closed to the north (where there are heights from which it originates) and to the west there are other hills, all of them in Ukrainian hands. The situation is manageable if the Ukrainians play their cards right. The bulk of the 25th Airborne Brigade is deployed several kilometers south of this area, so I guess in case of need the paratroopers could bail out the others in this area as well, just like they are doing around Terny in the Kreminna sector right now.",

The valley it forms is closed to the north (where there are heights from which it originates) and to the west there are other hills, all of them in Ukrainian hands. The situation is manageable if the Ukrainians play their cards right. The bulk of the 25th Airborne Brigade is deployed several kilometers south of this area, so I guess in case of need the paratroopers could bail out the others in this area as well, just like they are doing around Terny in the Kreminna sector right now.</p>\n</div>",

The **enemy has seized Tsarskaya Okhota** and is trying to gain a foothold on Chernyshevsky, Sportivnaya and Sobornaya streets. Stabilization measures are underway, and if they are not successful, it will jeopardize the entire eastern part of the city and its outskirts. The enemy continues to attack Heorhiivka and its north-eastern outskirts, with partial success. In the area of Novomykhailivka, he concentrates additional forces and tries to put pressure in small groups along the Vodiane-Kostiantynivka line.  \n>  \n>(...)  \n>  \n>Analysis \\[Analytical note\\] - As expected, the second half of January was difficult, as the Katsaps became more active in many areas. Over the last 4 weeks they have accumulated quite a lot of forces and are now trying to turn this accumulation into territorial gains. Unfortunately, their successes are the result of our repeated mistakes, not the enemy's Huderian \\[Guderian\\] decisions.

Sharing just the pertinent parts:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avdiivka sector - the situation in the south of Avdiivka remains critical. The <strong>enemy has seized Tsarskaya Okhota</strong> and is trying to gain a foothold on Chernyshevsky, Sportivnaya and Sobornaya streets. Stabilization measures are underway, and if they are not successful, it will jeopardize the entire eastern part of the city and its outskirts. The enemy continues to attack Heorhiivka and its north-eastern outskirts, with partial success. In the area of Novomykhailivka, he concentrates additional forces and tries to put pressure in small groups along the Vodiane-Kostiantynivka line.  </p>\n\n<p>(...)  </p>\n\n<p>Analysis [Analytical note] - As expected, the second half of January was difficult, as the Katsaps became more active in many areas. Over the last 4 weeks they have accumulated quite a lot of forces and are now trying to turn this accumulation into territorial gains. Unfortunately, their successes are the result of our repeated mistakes, not the enemy&#39;s Huderian [Guderian] decisions.

If we cant defend the #2 trade route in the world against a bunch of terrorists stuck in the dark ages, then whats stopping China from closing off entire East Asia? I mean, you are already seeing knock-on effects of the West not defending the world order. Just look at how emboldened countries like Venezuela now are in actively claiming territory of their neighbors (Guyana). Its not a coincidence that they are now testing the waters.\n\nThat #2 trade route is still open.  It's just takes longer now vs 3+ months ago.  You can go around the Africa.  In fact, most containers are going around Africa for the Asia-Europe route now.\n\nVenezuela barking about Guyana is magnitudes different \"problem\" vs the Houthis shooting off missiles.  As for the fan fiction of PRC closing off east Asia, one this hasn't happen and two PRC hasn't even contemplated publicly about shooting off their own foot.\n\n>So what is the cost of destroying the Houthi missile capacity? A couple of billion dollars? They have no real military. We aren't going in to stay like we did in Iraq. Just bomb their leaders enough so they get the message that its going to cost them their life if they continue. Not talking about regime change here\n\nIt will be WAY over a couple of billion dollars.  Just the SM-2 and SM-3 missiles spent so far intercepting missiles/drones already would be over a couple of billion dollars between replacement and having to bring the ships back to a port.  Just bombing from afar is not gonna solve the problem.  Israel couldn't stop Hamas from shooting off missiles after missiles from 10km x 40km strip of land with all the advantage.  How can US or anyone patrol 400km coastline just on the red sea side and another 1000km on the Gulf of Oman side?  You put boots on the ground, you are gonna be spending something in the neighborhood of $100 billion a year minimum.  US congress can't even pass $60 billion aid package to Ukraine where active war is going on and you want US to spend double that to solve a \"problem\".\n\n>Also, an idea - have the Egyptians or Saudis pay for any cost in taking out the Houthi missiles. The Saudis paid for the Gulf War. Charge them. Both have an interest in the Red Sea staying open, I'm sure they'd pay.\n\nWhere do you get these ideas?  Despite what you might have read on some fan fictions, US military is not a rent a cop operation.  You really think Egyptians or Saudis or anyone else is not paying because US/Europeans haven't asked or haven't asked nicely?  And conversely, if Egyptians who are definitely the most negatively impacted by this red sea-suez route being under utilized doesn't look too enthusiastic about doing something to change the situation, why should US/Europe put our blood and treasure to fix the problem for them?",

If we cant defend the #2 trade route in the world against a bunch of terrorists stuck in the dark ages, then whats stopping China from closing off entire East Asia?

That's a casualty rate of 53-63% of their entire force in just 3 and half months. It bears repeating, that this is a force that has spent its entire existence in integrating their fighters and infrastructure into the civilian population and hiding from the Israeli military.\n\nWhat on earth were the American intelligence analysts expecting? 80% casualties? 90%? 100%?\n\nWhen is the last time a military attacked a terrorist group and inflicted more casualties in a shorter amount of time?",

And Israel\u2019s assessment of the number of wounded Hamas fighters taken permanently out of the fight is much higher than the U.S.\u2019s.  </p>\n\n<p>Israeli officials estimate that as many as 16,000 Hamas fighters have been wounded and that about half of those won\u2019t return to the battlefield, according to a senior Israeli military official.  </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. estimates between 10,500 and 11,700 militants have been wounded, said a U.S. official familiar with the assessment, and that many of those could eventually return to the battlefield.  </p>\n\n<p>About 190 Israeli soldiers have died in Gaza since the start of Israel\u2019s ground campaign, with around 1,200 wounded, according to the Israel Defense Forces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I condensed the article to the important points. The tone of it is incredibly glum at the supposedly highly disappointing results of the still ongoing war.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, I completely disagree.</p>\n\n<p>America estimates 20-30% of Hamas has been killed, and another ~33% wounded. That&#39;s a casualty rate of 53-63% of their entire force in just 3 and half months. It bears repeating, that this is a force that has spent its entire existence in integrating their fighters and infrastructure into the civilian population and hiding from the Israeli military.</p>\n\n<p>What on earth were the American intelligence analysts expecting? 80% casualties? 90%? 100%?</p>\n\n<p>When is the last time a military attacked a terrorist group and inflicted more casualties in a shorter amount of time?</p>\n</div>",

NATO + Ukraine vs Russia and their partners. Western GDP is 22 times bigger. \n\nHow to include China? Not fair to include it on Russia's side because trade with China is global. If you include China on Russia's side, it would be fair to include other non-NATO allies in Ukraine's side. He's excluding it for simplicity. \n\nProblems with Nominal GDP in USD is that figures depend on exchange rate. Instead use PPP (purchasing power parity).

NATO + Ukraine vs Russia and their partners. Western GDP is 22 times bigger. </p>\n\n<p>How to include China? Not fair to include it on Russia&#39;s side because trade with China is global. If you include China on Russia&#39;s side, it would be fair to include other non-NATO allies in Ukraine&#39;s side. He&#39;s excluding it for simplicity. </p>\n\n<p>Problems with Nominal GDP in USD is that figures depend on exchange rate. Instead use PPP (purchasing power parity).
