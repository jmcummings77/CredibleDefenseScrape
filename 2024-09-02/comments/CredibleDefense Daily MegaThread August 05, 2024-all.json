I don&#39;t think I even need to explain how dominant our SSN force is either.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention, the last CMC went to <em>Congress</em> to get writing put into the NDAA mandating the CMC have control over how many amphibs the Navy gets to build (nevermind the Navy has to now spend money and people to man/train/equip said ships that are of dubious utility, which the Marines aren&#39;t even certain of), you really need to look deeper at what&#39;s going on in the halls of the Pentagon before you focus on one or two programs as examples of a branch having issues (which it most definitely does, but every branch has problems, and few get the political attention the Navy does as it has for most of its history)</p>\n</div>",

Reuters does not frame it in that way\n\n>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown on demonstrations that began as protests against job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her downfall.\n\n>Jubilant, cheering crowds stormed into the opulent grounds of the presidential residence unopposed, carrying out looted furniture and TVs.

There's limited internal R&D funding these companies are willing to spend on their own, so they go public (YOU are part of the audience) with concepts to try and gin up interest (especially with those connected in Congress and the DOD) to try and get some program office or resource sponsor to spend RDT&E money on these things. \n\nSomething that sounds too good to be true? Almost always is, but it makes for great \"why is the DOD so stupid for not investing in X product? Seems like they have a need! And look, company Y has a solution!\"\n\nThe reason you don't know much about it isn't because these are in the shadow; it's because there isn't anything to substantiate their claims. Developmental test of programs wouldn't take as long as it did if the contractor simply delivered what was originally promised on timeline; developmental hell happens when they don't (or if requirements change because the nature of the threat environment has done so)\n\nThese things typically appear at large expos/symposiums (as this did) because they lost a proposal on a weapon or they feel that said weapon's future is being threatened, so they go public and try to get someone in a program office somewhere or some resource sponsor to advocate for its continued development. \n\n(edit: consider JATM and HALO, both of which are programs of record in development, and you still don't have a photo of JATM or HALO anywhere - companies aren't happily revealing the fruits of their design concepts/preliminary engineering work publicly even if the SCG says they could, lest they give up their trade secrets, unless they've already won the contract and are feeling secure - or are desperate to try and get some funding thrown their way to recoup the costs of the work they've done)\n\nThe fact that this was originally for SiAW, and that Lockheed is now furiously advertising its carriage capability on an F-16, F-22, or F-35 (which all happen to be Lockheed products), specifically, should give it all away too: they want you to pay for them to develop said weapon so they can turn around and make money integrating it on their own platform. Look at how F-35 still hasn't completed integration of LRASM, despite LRASM being a Lockheed product - that's because the JPO had to pay Lockheed to integrate their own weapon on their own platform, and guess who is doing the testing on said integration? The DOD is. There is no \"we're developing this out of the goodness of our heart\" here, even within their own company.\n\n(edit: meanwhile in reality, actual programs of record get integrated regardless of a platform's contractor, because said weapons contractor gets paid regardless. LMT's LRASM was IOC'd on the B-1 and F/A-18E/F, where Boeing was the prime on both. JATM is IOC'ing on both LMT's Raptor and Boeing's F/A-18E/F. AARGM-ER is a Northrop weapon IOC'ing on the Boeing F/A-18E/F, etc. Only a weapon that has no actual program backing it would require a contractor pimping it on its own platforms so hard)\n\nIt's not always nefarious, for sure: I've seen contractors like MBDA pitch Meteor at the annual Tailhook symposium to a bunch of Navy pilots who know a hell of a lot about missiles and capabilities.

We can&#39;t lay most of the blame on the very entities that control the system and set the rules. Lockheed abusing lock in? Easy, improve requirements. I&#39;ve been in the rooms where the decision makers for military acquisitions were going to solve all of their problems with AI tools instead of listening to experts on acquisitions. I see no real reason to believe that the organizational problems within military acquisitions (which they are many) are going to go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No disagreement. As a &#39;customer&#39; of a lot of the products, I always cry when I read the original requirements. There is a major issue with not having enough operators in the loop with requirements writing - especially recent operators - and few SMEs on cutting edge technology writing said requirements.</p>\n</div>",

Back when the Soviet Union was spasming on its deathbed, the concern about what would happen to the nuclear weapons if the government in Moscow were to collapse was driven by a far wider range of concerns than just a central power vacuum. A lot of nuclear arsenal was positioned in former Soviet republics under tenuous Moscow control, with brewing ethnic conflict and/or strong ties to international terrorist organisations. Lots of nuclear waste was uncontrolled, and stored in similar conditions. The Soviet government's control over its own military was occasionally in question. And the Soviet Union had never really gone through a real succession crisis. Even after Stalin's death, the Party pretty much had things under control. \n\nSome of these things still apply but not to the same level. IMHO the only legitimate concern about a potential collapse of the current federal government is that it could bring an even more radical faction in power, but I think even that is overblown. Putin is already surounded by radicals. The chances of a government collapse bringing in a hawkish radical like Patrushev are about as high as the first round of elections after Putin's death bringing in a hawkish radical. Or Putin's first stroke, for that matter.\n\nIf I wanted to understand the muted response of Western actors, I'd look at post-Cold War factors. For example, the US has gradually distanced itself from its two-theatre war defence planning concept to one based on prevailing in a conflict while deterring opportunistic aggression elsewhere. Moscow's planning staff knows this as well as everyone else, it's been official policy under the three last presidents. (Yes, I know, I would also argue that treating aggression by Russia and China separately is short-sighted at this point, but that's a whole other story). This makes escalation a tough thing to bluff about. \n\nIt's not just that Moscow might eventually call an escalation bluff. The bigger problem is that even limited strategic escalation would increase deterrence costs, at a time when Western countries are dealing with a lot of demands beyond ther MICs capabilities. E.g. even if Russia won't actually use nuclear weapons in Ukraine (which, realistically, I strongly doubt, too, it would pretty much compromise their post-war position and, more importantly, would weaken their Chinese mast, um, friends' position too much) the mere deployment of tactical nuclear assets on NATO border would demand a reponse, at a time when NATO countries still have limited economic means for it and are struggling with opposition from frenemies like Hungary.\n\nNot that I'm defending any of this. To put it bluntly, I'm a military age resident of one of Russia's likely next targets, so I  wholeheartedly support any decision that places Russian troops six feet under, as practical experience in the last decades has shown that's the only reliable way to keep them on their side of the border. But I think it's important to understand where this escalation (mis)management is coming from, lest we keep listening to the kind of bullshit, and supporting the sort of policy, that brought us here.",

For example, the US has gradually distanced itself from its two-theatre war defence planning concept to one based on prevailing in a conflict while deterring opportunistic aggression elsewhere. Moscow&#39;s planning staff knows this as well as everyone else, it&#39;s been official policy under the three last presidents. (Yes, I know, I would also argue that treating aggression by Russia and China separately is short-sighted at this point, but that&#39;s a whole other story). This makes escalation a tough thing to bluff about. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not just that Moscow might eventually call an escalation bluff. The bigger problem is that even limited strategic escalation would increase deterrence costs, at a time when Western countries are dealing with a lot of demands beyond ther MICs capabilities. E.g. even if Russia won&#39;t actually use nuclear weapons in Ukraine (which, realistically, I strongly doubt, too, it would pretty much compromise their post-war position and, more importantly, would weaken their Chinese mast, um, friends&#39; position too much) the mere deployment of tactical nuclear assets on NATO border would demand a reponse, at a time when NATO countries still have limited economic means for it and are struggling with opposition from frenemies like Hungary.</p>\n\n<p>Not that I&#39;m defending any of this. To put it bluntly, I&#39;m a military age resident of one of Russia&#39;s likely next targets, so I  wholeheartedly support any decision that places Russian troops six feet under, as practical experience in the last decades has shown that&#39;s the only reliable way to keep them on their side of the border. But I think it&#39;s important to understand where this escalation (mis)management is coming from, lest we keep listening to the kind of bullshit, and supporting the sort of policy, that brought us here.</p>\n</div>",

All the way back in the 2018 elections in Madagascar.\n\n>The Russians were hard to miss. They appeared suddenly last year in Madagascar\u2019s traffic-snarled capital, carrying backpacks stuffed with cash and campaign swag decorated with the name of Madagascar\u2019s president.\n\n>It was one of Russia\u2019s most overt attempts at election interference to date. Working from their headquarters in a resort hotel, the Russians published their own newspaper in the local language and hired students to write fawning articles about the president to help him win another term. Skirting electoral laws, they bought airtime on television stations and blanketed the country with billboards.\nThey paid young people to attend rallies and journalists to cover them.
