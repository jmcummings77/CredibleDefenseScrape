        "body": "\ufffc\nHaving had a couple hours of sleep, I thought I would take a quick survey of the units which won the Kherson campaign  and what I expect their immediate futures hold, with some speculation on alternatives.  This review is more about condition and constitution than actual destination- Much to my surprise, the AFU command hasn\u2019t informed me where they plan to send them\n\nThe easiest evaluations are the 24th Mech Brigade and the 1st Special Purpose Brigade (being a Steve Martin fan, how could this not be my favorite unit?). They are both recent adds, veteran eastern brigades in good shape added for the big push. Given a week end to catch up on their sleep, they\u2019re ready to return from whence they came\n\nThe 46th Air Assault probably needs R&R&R, it\u2019s been in the thick of the fray\nand it hasn\u2019t received the Tank/Recon upgrades the rest of the Airborne brigades have gotten.\n\nThe 28th Mech needs some serious TLC. They have been the rock of the Southern Front from the Battle of Mykolaiv , securing Odessa against naval landing in the first days (remember that? ). Replacements and equipment have been fed in over the last six months, but they need a break to rationalize their structure and homogenize their equipment. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a 4 th battalion be added like the Eastern mech brigades, perhaps the Areys battalion who they have worked with. It would be nice if they could upgrade their 2S1 battalion with SPGs boasting better ammo availability, or even 105mms. Either way, a 2 month rebuild is probable.\n\nAll the marines have been rode hard and put away wet, and  need serious R&R&R. The 36th brigade has never been made whole after losing the 503rd at Mariupol and most of the trauma inducing twitter videos of entire Ukrainian assaults afire on the Inhulets have been the 35th and 36th naval infantry. The lot of them should be shipped back to Odessa for a month, to take stock. They can cobble together 2 under strength brigades by pulling in recruits and patching together vehicles, but they might be better served folding both into a single marine command, with 4 mech battalions, complete and homogenous tank and recon battalions and an over sized artillery regiment.  Just my opinion- they wouldn\u2019t be a weak link any more.\n\nLess contentious is the 63rd Mech Brigade.  One of the pre-established Reserve brigades, it received a full retrain and made it into the line in the summer. While they\u2019ve seen their share of fighting and could use some R&R, losses have not been profound. Two weeks of rest, a few vehicle replacements and a few western trained replacements is all they need before they get tore in again.\n\nLikewise, the 128th mountain brigade needs little more than a tune up before returning to the Duffy. As the left flank unit in the north east corner of the front, the new formed unit got lots of combat experience but avoided the real meat grinder battles. They just formed this summer, so they aren\u2019t over jaded. R&R of course, but good to go\n\nThe 57th and 59th motorized brigades should get a \u201cpimp my brigade\u201dmakeover.  All the motorized brigades are pencilled in for conversion to full mech brigades, and there\u2019s no time like the present. The motorized brigades have been profoundly disappointing - not the brave soldiers, but the viability of the unit structures. They were formed by cobbling together 3 territorial defense battalions, given trucks for movement , and a battalion of towed howitzers . In theory they have a company of tanks and a battalion of 100mm anti tank guns, but the first is too small to support a brigade and the second is never where it can do any good. MBs were a best available choice to expand the number of brigades pre-war, but they have little offensive capacity and are punching bags in the east.  How long it takes to convert them depends on how quickly APCs and SPGs can be gathered in sufficient quantity for the conversions.\n\nThe 5th and 17th tank brigades are in excellent shape , having suffered few losses, employed mostly as mobile reserves and for break through. They can be sent back to the front after a week or two off.  But I think they should be disbanded, or converted to mech brigades.  I know that\u2019s speculative, but hear me out- The tank brigades have badly under performed in this war. That many tanks are just too valuable to commit all at once to a fixed place battle. The huge tank on tank battles they were created for are DOA, killed by drones, accurate artillery, no wide open plains and St. Javelin. There\u2019s a reason the 17th is called \u201cthe unlucky 17th\u201d and it isn\u2019t the line soldiers. Tanks are still useful, deadly even, when employed as area fast reserves or  as part of combined arms force. But the first need is met with the other tank brigades and the second works better in mech brigades. \n\nTHis is just me talking here, but if the 5th and 17th were converted to mech brigades, they could supply the tank battalions needed for the 57th and 59th mech conversions, as well as for the 56th and 58th motorized brigades, also slated for conversion, (currently getting knocked around in the Donbas). their own mech battalions   provide asolid core, and there are battalions available to expedite the conversion (the 49th, the 214th  independent battalions come to mind. THere are several NG mech units floating about, or even snag a couple battalions from the 45th air assault brigade). Give the brigades a few weeks or a month to orient, and they would be good to go.\n\nFinally we reach the units I would expect to stay in place, guarding the Dniester. The 60th and 61st infantry, the 121, 126 and 129th Territorial Defense Brigades.  I don\u2019t really know much about the 60th and 61st Infantry brigades.  They\u2019re reserve brigades trained since the start of the war. There\u2019s some evidence they\u2019re mechanized or partially so, but I really can\u2019t find good info.I\u2019m assuming southern command will retain some form of mobile reserve for contingencies from the Dnipro to Odessa, and they are there- but pure speculation. All I know is that Ukraine shouldn\u2019t send more unarmored  and artillery light brigades to the East.  The TDBs have done their jobs, and this is where they belong, but I would be very surprised if the UGF didn\u2019t aggressively recruit from these units for new brigade(s); These are seasoned troops.\n\n\nBeyond that, the NG has a number of units and militias in the area, some substantial, but the NG does what the NG does.  And there\u2019s several independent artillery brigades: they come, go, train, or rearm at their own tempo as well. \n\nBut of the 17 fighting brigades of the Kherson salient, 5 should stick around, 5 can fight in the east in little more than a week, one needs a bit more than that,two tank brigades are available almost immediately but shouldn\u2019t be, two should be getting a rebuild and the marines, are the marines.",

And it did essentially result from a surprise Ukrainian attack, though initially a local one. You could say technically it was too small to really be an offensive but that's splitting hairs. \n\nBut I also do think there's way too much optimism sometimes, always 'ohh there are gonna be 10,000 Russian POWS this time!', and that's never happened. While it would be heartening to see Ukraine take a company/battalion or larger size force prisoner, the danger of pressing forward too fast and aggressively on a modern battlefield so dense with drones, mines, artillery fire, and snipers makes me think it'll be difficult without some sort of pervasive morale breakdown in the opposing Russian units.

If you fire less rounds, then you need much less maintenance for your gun, the barrel of the SPG is degraded much slower, etc.\n\nAll these factors allow you to save a ton of money, and even soldiers lives. These are all arguments that should be taken into consideration when talking about guided vs unguided.\n\nEven if you don't consider all the factors mentioned above, M982s are less expensive than normal rounds for precision fire. Non guided shells become less expensive only for large area targets (kind of obvious).\n\nThe study is: \"A comparative analysis of contemporary 155 mm artillery projectiles\".

The reason attackers got those favorable ratios was that they were doing these enormous artillery bombardments that <em>worked</em> to kill tens of thousands of people, and then they would send in the infantry to get slaughtered right afterwards. Generally this slightly favored the attacker because artillery is nasty like that.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine didn't have continuous visual coverage of the Dnipr, and to use HIMARs you need to estimate the barges position several seconds in advance so your GPS guided missiles can land there. Russian air defense and electric warfare jamming, plus the limited range of commercial drones meant that Ukraine rarely had eyes on barges crossing the river, especially at night.\n\nNo, so long as the Russians had a buffer to keep regular 155mm guns out of range they had the capability to get their forces out with enough time.",

The Antonov bridge was only closed to vehicle traffic, men could walk across it with minimal risk of getting HIMAR&#39;ed as long as they spaced out enough to not justify a 100k missile. The dam at Nova was a solid land link after the Russian&#39;s filled in the slipway with gravel, vehicle transport of a certain capacity there. Once again send one truck across every minute, not worth a HIMAR missile to blow up a single Ural.</p>\n\n<p>As for heavy vehicles like tanks, APCs or self propelled artillery, barges could transport them easily. Ukraine didn&#39;t have continuous visual coverage of the Dnipr, and to use HIMARs you need to estimate the barges position several seconds in advance so your GPS guided missiles can land there. Russian air defense and electric warfare jamming, plus the limited range of commercial drones meant that Ukraine rarely had eyes on barges crossing the river, especially at night.</p>\n\n<p>No, so long as the Russians had a buffer to keep regular 155mm guns out of range they had the capability to get their forces out with enough time.</p>\n</div>",

Then you also have less support from the US ahead - Republicans aren't that keen about supporting Ukraine, and while we don't have the final count, with high likelihood (>80%) they took the House in which case from now on they have full say in this too.

The Russian units further west, SW, and south of Izyum that were on the front line were facing those directions because they were on the front lines, they weren't positioned to stop and attack coming from the north.  \n\nWhen the Ukrainians were coming from the north and threatened to cut off the Russian route eastwards around the Oskil River ([as seen here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcVE8FYXoAEtpHU?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)), a retreat was the right call unless the Russians were content allowing all those units seen in that map to get cut off and encircled. Instead, they retreated, and while they left behind a shit load of material and vehicles, they still got out, which was the point. \n\n Lyman: The battle of Lyman was fought over for weeks, and the units inside (mostly BARS reservists) still held for weeks. Remember how every day the UA govt and various pro-Ukraine milblogger were reporting the Russians were encircled? They were wrong, for weeks, because that was how long they lasted until they retreated finally, intact. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Russian telegram back then was hammering leadership that there wasn\u2019t a coordinated defense but rather a piecemeal one.\n\nSome of that was justified, some seemed to be to find a scapegoat, and some of that could have been politics (Wagner encouraging bloggers to go after MOD). \n\nThe defense of the Russian operation area around Balakliya was criminally negligent, with how few units were positioned there, without a proper tactical reserve backing them up, etc. Realistically, someone with stars on their shoulder boards deserves a bullet in the back of the head for that fuck up. But despite setting themselves for failure, they still managed another successful retreat, as that very well could have caused a major encirclement and mass surrender of over a dozen BTGs had they not retreated as fast as they did. \n\nThe defense of Lyman was tossed together on the fly because that city wasn't on the front line in early Sept. It was only threatened because the chaos of the Kharkiv offensive especially the retreat from Izyum, as well as the previous retreat out of Ozerne and other locations on the north side of the Donets were also irresponsibly abandoned (before the Kharkiv offensive even started), which made Lyman suddenly a threat to a massed UAF attack. But despite it being a hasty defense, despite the units involved being...sucky, they still held for weeks, far longer than most estimated especially considering the nonstop reports of \"the Russians have been encircled in Lyman!\" \n\nI'm not trying to declare the Russians as some sort of defensive experts (far from it). But they're not as bad as your initial post made them out to be. An important maxim in warfare is to never underestimate your opponent, and we've seen repeatedly in this war what happens when that isn't followed.",

They were wrong, for weeks, because that was how long they lasted until they retreated finally, intact. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian telegram back then was hammering leadership that there wasn\u2019t a coordinated defense but rather a piecemeal one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some of that was justified, some seemed to be to find a scapegoat, and some of that could have been politics (Wagner encouraging bloggers to go after MOD). </p>\n\n<p>The defense of the Russian operation area around Balakliya was criminally negligent, with how few units were positioned there, without a proper tactical reserve backing them up, etc. Realistically, someone with stars on their shoulder boards deserves a bullet in the back of the head for that fuck up. But despite setting themselves for failure, they still managed another successful retreat, as that very well could have caused a major encirclement and mass surrender of over a dozen BTGs had they not retreated as fast as they did. </p>\n\n<p>The defense of Lyman was tossed together on the fly because that city wasn&#39;t on the front line in early Sept. It was only threatened because the chaos of the Kharkiv offensive especially the retreat from Izyum, as well as the previous retreat out of Ozerne and other locations on the north side of the Donets were also irresponsibly abandoned (before the Kharkiv offensive even started), which made Lyman suddenly a threat to a massed UAF attack. But despite it being a hasty defense, despite the units involved being...sucky, they still held for weeks, far longer than most estimated especially considering the nonstop reports of &quot;the Russians have been encircled in Lyman!&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not trying to declare the Russians as some sort of defensive experts (far from it). But they&#39;re not as bad as your initial post made them out to be. An important maxim in warfare is to never underestimate your opponent, and we&#39;ve seen repeatedly in this war what happens when that isn&#39;t followed.</p>\n</div>",
