But this would take a long time: \u201cIf we have to get to the Dnipro, then it will take about three years,\"\n\nThere\u2019s more in the interview about Bakhmut and politics, but let\u2019s just focus on the timetables he\u2019s stated for now. It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s getting ready for the long haul. A war that lasts as long as the Great Patriotic War. \n\nWhat would the Russian army look like in 3 years? Who makes up that army? How do equipment stocks look?\n\nIf you\u2019re Prigozhin, you\u2019re a year into this war and you\u2019re having some problems recruiting from prisons. What do you do? Do you start forcibly conscripting? Or do you begin to look elsewhere?

One to two years to take the Donbas? That\u2019s going to be a brutal, grueling slog. A grueling slog with increasingly older equipment against an enemy that\u2019s slowly modernizing their force. Then after that, you might be faced with years more conflict to reach the river, and that\u2019s if things are going your way! \n\nIf Prigozhin\u2019s way of thinking in any way is in line with the Kremlin, they are only entrenching themselves in this war.

                "body": "There were recent reports of (political, not kinetic!) clashes between Wagner and the RU MOD. The clashes have erupted along the lines of the differing available strategies on how best to prosecute the war. These strategies can best be summed in two different schools:\n\n1) The defensive Army and the offensive Wagner. This strategy has been more active since the collapse of the Kharkiv front but has been in use since the start of the war. In essence: you use mobilized Russian regulars to build several strongpoints and defensive fortifications along the whole of the front. Then, you use mass infantry and artillery assaults by Wagner mercs as offensive spearheads to clear enemy fortifications. As you can expect, this strategy is extremely costly, in both men and material. But with Wagner men extremely cheap (they are mostly convicts and the dregs of Russian society--Wagner may also one day recruit disaffected young men worldwide--practically an infinite supply of manpower), the cost can be borne relatively easily. It's very similar to WW1 tactics, only with the tools of modern warfare, the lines aren't static; rather they just move very, very slowly--imagine if France had counterattacked Germany in 1914 and reached the Rhine by 1917--similar concept as we are now seeing in places like Bakhmut.\n\n2) The offensive Army and the irrelevant Wagner. This tactic is what Russia desperately wants and frankly needs to return to; the strategems of yore, with mass armored assaults and pincers, enveloping whole Ukrainian brigades and divisions. Many people believe this tactic is a relic of the past, and in an era with drones and HIMARs, it just exists in our memory. But moving fast and encircling your opponent has been a totem of warfare since humans first went to war (for a more recent example: Napoleon's first campaign in Italy is the Ur-example of how a smaller force can repeatedly defeat larger armies). In other words: the smartest generals win battles long before the enemy is even spotted. In addition, no tool is perfect, even HIMARs (a mass swarm of drones and missile strikes could neutralize a battery, for instance).\n\nAs recent news has shown, Putin and by extension Russia want to give the RU MOD one last chance to try the latter strategy. We've all seen reports of Russia massing troops and armor for a massive offensive. If it succeeds, then the war won't be a slog anymore but rather a fast-moving blitz, much like WW2. They may not win the war this year, but they will be closer than ever.\n\nPrigozhin, of course, has every incentive to see to it that the MOD fails. If it does, then Wagner will likely persist and increase its influence to the detriment of the MOD. If Russia had to use Wagner strategies, then his prediction is accurate: the war will slog for many more years. And while that will suck for everyone, we must keep in mind that Prigozhin is first a mercenary and second a Russian. In other words, what is good for him is not what is good for Russia, or indeed, the world.",

I'm also skeptical that the RU military can use Mobiks like Wagner used convicts without domestic backlash.\n\nTotally agree, I've been making the same point for awhile now. Separatist forces were totally expendable, and so are Russian convicts.

After all, Russia can not easily fund the war with debt, and would have to rely on the printing press or bargain basement asset sales to fill the hole when the money runs out.

Take into consideration that refining oil results in a blend of products. From every barrel you get a mixture of gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, oil, and heavy asphalt (In reality is a bunch of different products and different grades but those are the main ones). Normally, your domestic consumers will not be able to consume all of the product so you of course export the rest. But what happens if you can't export or have to sell those refine products at a cap like the crude? You certainly can not keep refining at the same pace because there is not enough storing capacity for it.

From every barrel you get a mixture of gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, oil, and heavy asphalt (In reality is a bunch of different products and different grades but those are the main ones). Normally, your domestic consumers will not be able to consume all of the product so you of course export the rest. But what happens if you can&#39;t export or have to sell those refine products at a cap like the crude? You certainly can not keep refining at the same pace because there is not enough storing capacity for it. Cutting production:\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/business/russian-oil-price-sanctions.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/business/russian-oil-price-sanctions.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Source on Russian deficit of $25 Billion in one month.

Cue near a decade of grind with the gulf states throwing money at iraq to keep them operational (a large part of why he invaded kuwait to cover the debts) that largely failed to achieve anything for either side.\n\nA brief summary from Lawrence Freedman's 'Command: The Politics of Military Operations from Korea to Ukraine'\n\n>> Iraq opened hostilities on 22 September with an attempt to emulate the\nJune 1967 Israeli air strike against the Egyptian Air Force, but without the\nsame success. The next day the army crossed the border. The Iranians\nstruggled with this unexpected offensive, and soon retreated to their cities as\nthey would be easier to defend. But contrary to Saddam\u2019s hopes, the regime\ndid not collapse. It opted for escalation rather than concessions. The Iranian\nnavy attacked oil terminals near the port of Al-Fao and its air force attacked\nBaghdad. Iraq responded with air strikes of its own. Not only was Saddam\nnow experiencing the escalation he had hoped to avoid, but matters were\nnot working out as anticipated on the ground. The terrain was too\nmountainous for Iraqi troops to make quick progress. In an early battle for\nthe city of Khorramshahr, they were held up by determined resistance.\nEventually, in late October, the city fell, leading Saddam to congratulate\nhimself on a \u2018victory that generations will talk about a hundred years from\nnow\u2019. He also cautioned that the war was not yet over. It \u2018could stretch on\nfor a year, maybe less\u2019.15 It lasted another eight years.\n\n>> Saddam\u2019s next mistake was to lose whatever momentum his forces had\ngathered by announcing that, since his limited objectives had been achieved,\nIraq would now pursue a defensive strategy.16 The Iranians had used the\ntime gained by resisting at Khorramshahr to reorganize their forces. As they\nmoved to the offensive, they began to gain the upper hand, retaking lost\nland and preparing to move into Iraq. Saddam, recognizing the shift in the\nmilitary balance, withdrew from Iranian territory in June 1982 and ordered\na robust defensive line to protect Iraqi territory. Although this survived the\nfirst onslaught by Iranian forces they kept on coming. Saddam\u2019s regular\nproposals for a ceasefire were ignored.\n\n>> Away from the struggle for territory, the respective oil industries were\nunder attack, and eventually this extended to all oil traffic in the Gulf. By\nthe time the war ended in 1988, there had been bombardment of cities and\nuse of chemical weapons. The casualties accumulated on both sides,\nalthough the oft-quoted figure of a combined total of a million by the time\nof the ceasefire is probably an exaggeration \u2013 the actual total was closer to\n250,000 on the Iraqi side and 155,000 on the Iranian.17 On land, the\nstruggle was shaped by Iraq\u2019s desperate efforts to stop Iran seizing even\nmore of its territory. In this respect, Saddam was saved by the ineptitude of\nthe Iranian leadership. Iran\u2019s command structure was even more fragmented\nand dysfunctional than Iraq\u2019s, and its tactics were reckless and wasteful.\n\n>> In February 1986, an Iranian offensive at last succeeded. Following a\nfeint to attack Basra, the main force went to the Al-Fao Peninsula, which it\ntook successfully. Iraqi counter-attacks failed and it was only with difficulty\nthat they stopped Iran moving into Basra. The Iranians exhausted themselves\nwith a series of futile offensives, as the Iraqis reorganized. In mid-April 1988\nAl-Fao was retaken and Iraq regained the initiative. In July 1988, Iran\naccepted a ceasefire. For Saddam, the outcome bore little relation to what\nhad been sought when he started the war, but, after many years on the\ndefensive, a ceasefire with the Iranians off Iraqi territory could be presented\nas a victory of sorts.",

The next day the army crossed the border. The Iranians\nstruggled with this unexpected offensive, and soon retreated to their cities as\nthey would be easier to defend. But contrary to Saddam\u2019s hopes, the regime\ndid not collapse. It opted for escalation rather than concessions. The Iranian\nnavy attacked oil terminals near the port of Al-Fao and its air force attacked\nBaghdad. Iraq responded with air strikes of its own. Not only was Saddam\nnow experiencing the escalation he had hoped to avoid, but matters were\nnot working out as anticipated on the ground. The terrain was too\nmountainous for Iraqi troops to make quick progress. In an early battle for\nthe city of Khorramshahr, they were held up by determined resistance.\nEventually, in late October, the city fell, leading Saddam to congratulate\nhimself on a \u2018victory that generations will talk about a hundred years from\nnow\u2019. He also cautioned that the war was not yet over. It \u2018could stretch on\nfor a year, maybe less\u2019.15 It lasted another eight years.</p>\n\n<p>Saddam\u2019s next mistake was to lose whatever momentum his forces had\ngathered by announcing that, since his limited objectives had been achieved,\nIraq would now pursue a defensive strategy.16 The Iranians had used the\ntime gained by resisting at Khorramshahr to reorganize their forces. As they\nmoved to the offensive, they began to gain the upper hand, retaking lost\nland and preparing to move into Iraq. Saddam, recognizing the shift in the\nmilitary balance, withdrew from Iranian territory in June 1982 and ordered\na robust defensive line to protect Iraqi territory. Although this survived the\nfirst onslaught by Iranian forces they kept on coming. Saddam\u2019s regular\nproposals for a ceasefire were ignored.</p>\n\n<p>Away from the struggle for territory, the respective oil industries were\nunder attack, and eventually this extended to all oil traffic in the Gulf. By\nthe time the war ended in 1988, there had been bombardment of cities and\nuse of chemical weapons. The casualties accumulated on both sides,\nalthough the oft-quoted figure of a combined total of a million by the time\nof the ceasefire is probably an exaggeration \u2013 the actual total was closer to\n250,000 on the Iraqi side and 155,000 on the Iranian.17 On land, the\nstruggle was shaped by Iraq\u2019s desperate efforts to stop Iran seizing even\nmore of its territory. In this respect, Saddam was saved by the ineptitude of\nthe Iranian leadership. Iran\u2019s command structure was even more fragmented\nand dysfunctional than Iraq\u2019s, and its tactics were reckless and wasteful.</p>\n\n<p>In February 1986, an Iranian offensive at last succeeded. Following a\nfeint to attack Basra, the main force went to the Al-Fao Peninsula, which it\ntook successfully. Iraqi counter-attacks failed and it was only with difficulty\nthat they stopped Iran moving into Basra. The Iranians exhausted themselves\nwith a series of futile offensives, as the Iraqis reorganized. In mid-April 1988\nAl-Fao was retaken and Iraq regained the initiative. In July 1988, Iran\naccepted a ceasefire. For Saddam, the outcome bore little relation to what\nhad been sought when he started the war, but, after many years on the\ndefensive, a ceasefire with the Iranians off Iraqi territory could be presented\nas a victory of sorts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Demand for Russian commodities affects government revenue but does not directly affect Russia's ability to finance it's deficit. A stronger ruble means more revenue from commodity exports (and more purchasing power when importing) but also means Russian gas is more expensive in foreign markets.\n\n>countries can engage in all sorts of monetary shenanigans (as we saw when the rouble didn't miraculously collapse last year). \n\nI've already explained what the Russian government can do.\n\n>They could always just try having the central bank buy their debt. \n\nI already mentioned that they can print money.\n\n>It's what we've been doing for the past 15 years with few major side effects.\n\nThat's because the mechanisms by which money supply was introduced to the economy were different. Financing Russian government spending with the central bank will create inflationary pressure across the Russian economy because the money immediately circulates through the economy as paychecks and goods purchased. During the 2010s, the FED purchased securities from banks (quantitive easing) and lowered interest rates so this monetary expansion did not manifest as inflation across the wider economy because the money did not directly circulate throughout the economy.

I'd imagine that number is going to be larger, but assuming it's not; I think Russia has like 3-4years assuming everything else stays the same. \n\nYou also can't just look at the national wealth fund, that's the most important; but the foreign debt they have is also something they can use. About 30% of it was in sources that they pulled out at the start of the war(trains from China carrying gold), the other 70% is freezable; but lots of news suggesting only something like 50% of that was frozen, and the Banks don't even know where all of the frozen assets are...\n\nEven if you assume the worst case scenario for Russia, they still have enough foreign debt+national reserves to go on for years. If you assume that they'll find ways to circumvent sanctions(like Iran has for example), if you assume they'll invest more and more of the economy into the war, etc. they can sustain this for a very long time.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that only like <10% of companies pulled out of Russia, and most of these weren't doing much business in Russia in the first place. [Only about 8 percent of EU firms have divested from Russia](https://www.politico.eu/article/majority-of-western-companies-continue-business-in-russia-study-finds/)\n\nWorth looking into the study that's linked in the article for details. I don't know why, but ever since the start of the war; west(but most importantly EU) has not taken the economic war very seriously. There was so much about the sanctions in the news, and to me it looks like that either capitalism is too strong and governments have very little power or no mechanisms to actually stop businesses *or* they're willfully not committing to the economic war.\n\nWhatever it is, people like Kamil Galeev have been pointing this out since the first month of the invasion with some very juicy details. Like how some German companies have used proxies in Czech Republic to do bussiness with Russia, using Turkey as gateway, the black markets, etc.\nAnother interesting thing from the economic side is that Russia started their preparations for their war(as far as we can track) in the summer of 2022. That's when they just out of the blue start importing all kinds of stuff very heavily, especially electronics. \n\nWould be interested to see what people think. A lot of people are saying sanctions are crushing Russia, etc. but I think this is false. The first time there was any sort of 'criticism' from western POV of sanctions was like ~3months after the invasion, and it was a minor affair in media; there's been some more of that recently, but again it's largely ignored. There are indications in the EU parliament that there is progressively more unity in sanctioning, but in  terms of actions taken it seems weak to me.\n\n[Worth a look](https://eumatrix.eu/en/blog/eu-russia-political-index-where-does-each-party-stand)",

They didn't really plan their logistics, so didn't have combat loads ready and especially not follow on logistics planned out. They were getting jammed by their own EW used by the VKS, made worse since they didn't even have time to load their radios with COMSEC and frequency hopping keys because they didn't have time, which meant they couldn't even properly communicate to do anything. \n\nHad they performed that invasion doctrinally, expecting resistance, they've used lots more artillery from the get go. The way that works during maneuver warfare is if contact is likely or expected when doing sometime like approaching a town up ahead, some of the accompanying artillery (they have lots) pulls over and sets up, potentially already firing on the location in support of the advance (which would suppress a lot of the antiarmor hunter killer teams), while the assault force is task organized and prepared to fight it's way through, not just drive through. They'd have drones up overwatching everything, tied into their artillery fire control system so as some as they spotted Ukraine forces they'd start dropping rounds on them, and then maneuvering on them at the platoon to battalion level. They tried doing that in March but they were still too disorganized, strung out, and far too few to succeed. \n\nBy late March, after the retreat from Kyiv-Chernihiv-Sumy and away from Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia, they consolidated enough and the rest of the front lines were solidifying, Ukrainian defenses were firm enough they literally started digging in, etc. At that point it's positional warfare. Nobody is moving without a breakthrough, there is no more bypassing, no more giant gaps due to a fragmented battlefield, which is key to maneuver warfare at the operational level (Ukrainians put at least blocking positions on all roads, trails, etc).\n\nThe Russians were still attacking Izyum during the March to April timeframe but a significant part of the force was taking an operational pause to get their shit together, especially logistics. When that was fixed, they launched the Donbas salient offensive, which was fires centric because for the first time they could follow their doctrine, for the first time they could mass their units (and artillery), their logistics were becoming streamlined to a degree it was actually extremely dangerous should the Ukrainians use long range PGMs for a dedicated supply interdict campaign (started late June). \n\nBut the Russians have been unable to successfully perform maneuver warfare at the operational level for the entire war, first through terrible planning and preparation, then because the Ukrainians removed weak points, and then due to losses and an inability to reconstitute units with any sort of legit offensive potential that wasn't part of a HIGHLY choreographed set piece battle, done as part of positional war. \n\n>Russia does not have that amount of fires that they had last summer\n\nIt's no wonder, that level of fires was beyond doctrine, and wasn't sustainable. Their vulnerability to HIMARS shows why, they had developed SOPs that were incredibly risky unless the Ukrainians didn't have the ability to regularly target their tactical and operational rear areas on a regular basis (with didn't happen until late June). \n\nBut as Bakhmut has been demonstrating through fall and winter especially, they don't need May-June levels of artillery fires to achieve tactical success. Frankly, it would probably be better for them to get less ammo, then they'd have to use it better, smarter, more effectively. \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" When they're constrained they have to think smarter, they have to coordinate more, etc, and being that they're fighting positionally they have the luxury of doing that. \n\n>And even if the ongoing offensive is not a maneuver offensive, it is directly and heavily degrading Russian maneuver assets and capabilities.\n\nAll combat operations do that, it's the trade off about not only whether or not to defend or attack but whether to fight or retreat. \n\nTo switch to the offensive comes with the cost of using up manpower, supplies, and equipment higher than defending, but has the potential to accomplish strategic goals, achieve victories, etc, which can't be achieved defending. Being that Ukraine is also suffering attrition, it's also a trade-off (though trying to win an attritional war is pretty stupid considering the West gives more to the Ukrainians when they're losing then they're winning). \n\nThe Russians didn't make progress around Svatove-Kreminna, Bakhmut still hasn't fallen, and they got stomped on at Vulhedar. So they look like idiots for doing it. Had those succeeded, the conversation would be totally different. \n\nToo much of this current conversation is like mid May with the failed river crossing, a tactical defeat at heavy cost where many tried to use that as proof the Russians couldn't do anything right. And then a month later they took the entirety of Luhansk by outfighting the Ukrainians. We need enough patience to wait a few weeks or months to see what happens before we decide to write off the Russians.",

When that was fixed, they launched the Donbas salient offensive, which was fires centric because for the first time they could follow their doctrine, for the first time they could mass their units (and artillery), their logistics were becoming streamlined to a degree it was actually extremely dangerous should the Ukrainians use long range PGMs for a dedicated supply interdict campaign (started late June). </p>\n\n<p>But the Russians have been unable to successfully perform maneuver warfare at the operational level for the entire war, first through terrible planning and preparation, then because the Ukrainians removed weak points, and then due to losses and an inability to reconstitute units with any sort of legit offensive potential that wasn&#39;t part of a HIGHLY choreographed set piece battle, done as part of positional war. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia does not have that amount of fires that they had last summer</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s no wonder, that level of fires was beyond doctrine, and wasn&#39;t sustainable. Their vulnerability to HIMARS shows why, they had developed SOPs that were incredibly risky unless the Ukrainians didn&#39;t have the ability to regularly target their tactical and operational rear areas on a regular basis (with didn&#39;t happen until late June). </p>\n\n<p>But as Bakhmut has been demonstrating through fall and winter especially, they don&#39;t need May-June levels of artillery fires to achieve tactical success. Frankly, it would probably be better for them to get less ammo, then they&#39;d have to use it better, smarter, more effectively. &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention.&quot; When they&#39;re constrained they have to think smarter, they have to coordinate more, etc, and being that they&#39;re fighting positionally they have the luxury of doing that. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And even if the ongoing offensive is not a maneuver offensive, it is directly and heavily degrading Russian maneuver assets and capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All combat operations do that, it&#39;s the trade off about not only whether or not to defend or attack but whether to fight or retreat. </p>\n\n<p>To switch to the offensive comes with the cost of using up manpower, supplies, and equipment higher than defending, but has the potential to accomplish strategic goals, achieve victories, etc, which can&#39;t be achieved defending. Being that Ukraine is also suffering attrition, it&#39;s also a trade-off (though trying to win an attritional war is pretty stupid considering the West gives more to the Ukrainians when they&#39;re losing then they&#39;re winning). </p>\n\n<p>The Russians didn&#39;t make progress around Svatove-Kreminna, Bakhmut still hasn&#39;t fallen, and they got stomped on at Vulhedar. So they look like idiots for doing it. Had those succeeded, the conversation would be totally different. </p>\n\n<p>Too much of this current conversation is like mid May with the failed river crossing, a tactical defeat at heavy cost where many tried to use that as proof the Russians couldn&#39;t do anything right. And then a month later they took the entirety of Luhansk by outfighting the Ukrainians. We need enough patience to wait a few weeks or months to see what happens before we decide to write off the Russians.</p>\n</div>",

The incumbents like Hughes and Viasat simply can't come close to the bandwidth Starlink does, particularly on the uplink. Those max out at like just enough to send SD video under ideal conditions. Just by the nature of its dense network and phased array antennas, Starlink should be considerably more jamming resistant.

What is so secret after todays revelations that the public cannot know about?\n\nIf it was 1 Chinese spy balloon and 2 civilian balloons then it looks like paranioa.\n\nIf it was 3 Chinese spy balloons its going to have to be a very carefully managed political situation both internally and externally. There are those who will very vocally go nuts at \"not defending US air space\" and basically want us 1 stop short of war with China. \n\nEither way its likely way above the paygrade of a night duty NORAD officer. It will take a full press briefing from cabinet level secretary like Sec Def or from the president himself.\n\nI think a lot of things have clicked into place in the past week and the US may have to fess up to having been monitored for 15-20 years like this. \n\nMy hot take is that they started to work it out in 2020 when looking at old \"UAP\" reports, put together the software to be able to track these things on radar and waited for the right time to bring this all to a crashing halt. \n\n> The spy balloons observed during the Trump administration were initially classified as unidentified aerial phenomena, U.S. officials said.

Such slanderous accusations are baseless, because actual democracy doesn&#39;t exist anywhere. The only place coming close is Switzerland. Everyone else in Europe for instance, including Russia and Turkey have elections for representatives as well as for presidents, where the respective republic (constitutional monarchies in Europe are parliamentarian, that means the prime minister of the most successful party gets the leadership) is presidential or semi-presidential, like Serbia, Romania, Russia Turkey, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Calling only Europe democratic shows your profound lack of knowledge of the idea and history and practice of democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Here is some reading material:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/democracy\">https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/democracy</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/democracy/our-chief-danger\">https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/democracy/our-chief-danger</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/democracy/hiding-plain-sight\">https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/democracy/hiding-plain-sight</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/simone-weil-on-the-abolition-of-all-political-parties\">https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/simone-weil-on-the-abolition-of-all-political-parties</a></p>\n</div>",

If you're going to pretend a democratic republic is not democratic at this point you're redefining words. Anywhere voters choose who goes into office is by definition, democratic.\n\nJust because you don't like either of the two main parties doesn't mean it isn't a real choice.

I would agree that the government should be funding political parties so others can better compete, but that would not alone be sufficient to create a political party, you need a movement, and you don't have one.

What **the OSCE discovered was that the bombardment dramatically intensified as the week went on until it reached a peak on February 19, when a total of 2,026 artillery strikes were recorded.** Keep in mind, the Ukrainian Army was, in fact, shelling civilian areas along the Line of Contact that were occupied by other Ukrainians.\n\nWe want to emphasize that the officials from the OSCE were operating in their professional capacity gathering first-hand evidence of shelling in the area. What their data shows is that Ukrainian Forces were bombing and killing their own people. This has all been documented and has not been challenged.\n\nSo, the question we must all ask ourselves is this: Is the bombardment and slaughter of one\u2019s own people an \u2018act of war\u2019?\n\nWe think it is. And if we are right, then we must logically assume that the war began before the Russian invasion (which was launched a full week later) We must also assume that Russia\u2019s alleged \u201cunprovoked aggression\u201d was not unprovoked at all but was the appropriate humanitarian response to the deliberate killing of civilians. In order to argue that the Russian invasion was \u2018not provoked\u2019, we would have to say that firing over 4,000 artillery shells into towns and neighborhoods where women and children live, is not a provocation? Who will defend that point of view?\n\nNo one, because it\u2019s absurd. The killing of civilians in the Donbas was a clear provocation, a provocation that was aimed at goading Russia into a war. And \u2013as we said earlier\u2013 the OSCE had monitors on the ground who provided full documentation of the shelling as it took place, which is as close to ironclad, eyewitness testimony as you\u2019re going to get.\n\nThis, of course, is a major break with the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d which identifies Russia as the perpetrator of hostilities. But, as we\u2019ve shown, that simply isn\u2019t the case. The official narrative is wrong. Even so, it might not surprise you to know that most of the mainstream media completely omitted any coverage of the OSCE\u2019s fact-finding activities in east Ukraine. The one exception to was Reuters that published a deliberately opaque account published on February 18 titled \u201cRussia voices alarm over sharp increase of Donbass shelling\u201d. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov voiced alarm on Friday over a sharp increase in shelling in eastern Ukraine and accused the OSCE special monitoring mission of glossing over what he said were Ukrainian violations of the peace process\u2026.\n\nWashington and its allies have raised fears that the upsurge in violence in the Donbass could form part of a Russian pretext to invade Ukraine. Tensions are already high over a Russian military buildup to the north, east and south of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned by the reports of recent days \u2013 yesterday and the day before there was a sharp increase in shelling using weapons that are prohibited under the Minsk agreements,\u201d Lavrov said, referring to peace accords aimed at ending the conflict. \u201cSo far we are seeing the special monitoring mission is doing its best to smooth over all questions that point to the blame of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military on Friday denied violating the Minsk peace process and accused Moscow of waging an information war to say that Kyiv was shelling civilians, allegations it said were lies and designed to provoke it.\u201d (Russia voices alarm over sharp increase of Donbass shelling, Reuters).\n\nAnd so on....\n\n\nHowever, the best ending of this article would have been the words of a former CIA Director responsible for Russian affairs, under Bush/Cheney:\n\n\u201c**The choice that we faced in Ukraine \u2014 and I'm using the past tense there intentionally \u2014 was whether Russia exercised a veto over NATO involvement in Ukraine on the negotiating table or on the battlefield**,\u201d said George Beebe, a former director of Russia analysis at the CIA and special adviser on Russia to former Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201c**And we elected to make sure that the veto was exercised on the battlefield, hoping that either Putin would stay his hand or that the military operation would fail.**\u201d\n\nhttps://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/russia-s-ukraine-invasion-may-have-been-preventable-n1290831",
