Ship\u2013tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show dozens of Russian and Iranian vessels\u2014including some that are subject to sanctions\u2014already plying the route.\r  \n\r  \n>It\u2019s an example of how great\u2013power competition is rapidly reshaping trade networks in a world economy that looks set to fragment into rival blocs. Russia and Iran, under tremendous pressure from sanctions, are turning toward each other\u2014and they\u2019re both looking eastward, too. The goal is to shield commercial links from Western interference and build new ones with the giant and fast\u2013growing economies of Asia.  \n \n>\u201cThis is about establishing sanctions\u2013proof supply chains all the way through,\u201d says Maria Shagina, an expert on sanctions and Russian foreign policy at the London\u2013based International Institute for Strategic Studies.\r  \n\r  \n>The emerging trade corridor would allow Russia and Iran to shave thousands of kilometers off existing routes. At its northern end is the Sea of Azov, which is bracketed by the Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine\u2019s southeastern coast\u2014including the Russian\u2013occupied port of Mariupol\u2014and the mouth of the River Don.  \n \n>Earlier this month, listing his country\u2019s gains from the war in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said the Sea of Azov \u201chas become an inland sea\u201d for Russia.\r  \n\r  \n>From there river, sea and rail networks extend to Iranian hubs on the Caspian Sea and ultimately the Indian Ocean. Putin has flagged the importance of that end of the corridor, as well.\r  \n\r  \n>At an economic forum in September he underlined the need to develop the ship, rail and road infrastructure along the route that \u201cwill provide Russian companies with new opportunities to enter the markets of Iran, India, the Middle East and Africa, and will facilitate supplies from these countries in return.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n>Shagina estimates Russia and Iran are investing as much as $25 billion in the inland trade corridor, helping to facilitate the flow of goods the West wants to stop. \u201cThe two countries are playing a cat\u2013and\u2013mouse game,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will explore all loopholes to transport banned products and weapons.\u201d  \n \n>That alarms the US and its allies, as they seek to block transfers of Iranian drones and other military supplies they say are aiding the Kremlin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\r  \n\r  \n>\u201cIt is an area we\u2019re watching carefully, both that route and more generally the Iranian\u2013Russian connection,\u201d said the Biden administration\u2019s top sanctions official, James O\u2019Brien, after announcing new punishments last week that target executives at Russian Railways. \u201cWe are concerned with any effort to help Russia evade the sanctions.\u201d",

The Kuznetsov seems to have dodged even basic servicing for much of its lifespan, a combination of poor resourcing and bad discipline. From pictures posted online, much of the ship's underworks seems to have devolved into a Silent Hill-esq horrorshop. To make matters worse, the Russians clearly dont treat her very well even now. On her last deployment she was churning out thick plombs of black smoke suggest that either she was converted to coal boilers (joke) or they were burning bunker fuel in her (not joke). Bunker fuel is a lower grade then diesel and is commonly used in home heating. Its cheap sludge that gums up engines fast, no surprise then that the Kuz needed to be towed part of the way home after her diesels broke. \n\nShes in bad shape and has been a while, and its largely because of a lack of interest, strategic rationale, and as a result money. This refit is costing millions of dollars just to do long delayed servicing (and btw, one of the dock managers was recently arrested for embezzling funds for the Kuz. These recent accidents also seem emblematic of the kinds of shoddy work and low standards which got her in this position in the first place). Upgrading her capabilities, even to make her competitive with her foreign owned sister ships, would probably cost billions and take even more time.\n\nSo could the Russians make something new and unpresented on the hull? Sure. That would just take time, money, interest, and strategic rationale. But if all those things had been there for Kuz before she wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.",

On her last deployment she was churning out thick plombs of black smoke suggest that either she was converted to coal boilers (joke) or they were burning bunker fuel in her (not joke). Bunker fuel is a lower grade then diesel and is commonly used in home heating. Its cheap sludge that gums up engines fast, no surprise then that the Kuz needed to be towed part of the way home after her diesels broke. </p>\n\n<p>Shes in bad shape and has been a while, and its largely because of a lack of interest, strategic rationale, and as a result money. This refit is costing millions of dollars just to do long delayed servicing (and btw, one of the dock managers was recently arrested for embezzling funds for the Kuz. These recent accidents also seem emblematic of the kinds of shoddy work and low standards which got her in this position in the first place). Upgrading her capabilities, even to make her competitive with her foreign owned sister ships, would probably cost billions and take even more time.</p>\n\n<p>So could the Russians make something new and unpresented on the hull? Sure. That would just take time, money, interest, and strategic rationale. But if all those things had been there for Kuz before she wouldn&#39;t be in this situation in the first place.</p>\n</div>",

Even if they did somehow miraculously strike a carrier, I think you severely underestimate how much it takes to sink such a massive ship.   </p>\n\n<p>For starters, <a href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/news/us-navy-aircraft-carrier-war-china/\">https://taskandpurpose.com/news/us-navy-aircraft-carrier-war-china/</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/just-how-hard-it-sink-aircraft-carrier-166482\">https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/just-how-hard-it-sink-aircraft-carrier-166482</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a good quote   </p>\n\n<p>&quot;\u201cRather than talking about the vulnerability of the aircraft carrier \u2026 we should think about it as perhaps the most survivable airfield in the region,\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>Think about the role they play, delivering air assets to the conflict zone. In a war with China what other options are there... Okinawa, Guam, Wake Island, maybe Palau, Darwin, somewhere in the Philippines but those are all sitting ducks compared to a carrier on the move.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2019/3/22/incoming-can-aircraft-carriers-survive-hypersonic-weapons\">https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2019/3/22/incoming-can-aircraft-carriers-survive-hypersonic-weapons</a>  </p>\n\n<p>If carriers were as useless and vulnerable as people like you seem to think China, and many other advanced nations, wouldn&#39;t be scrambling to build as many as they can afford, as quickly as possible.</p>\n</div>",

American weapon systems are all more expensive than Russia\u2019s. \n\nThe Excalibur 155mm shell is expensive, but it sure kills Russians dead, right? It works, just like the Patriot.

On top of that, the speed with which new ideas are being tested and tried and discarded has got to have a multiplying effect. We can see a drone configuration created, applied, and implemented in 2 or 3 months on the battle field. And we know if it works or not.

Try to maintain tactical through strategic secrecy by not making it obvious, and trying to bait the Ukrainians to weaken those lines to strengthen another far away with a deception plan.</p>\n</div>",

It is in Russia's best interest to devote as skeletal a crew along the entire length as possible, but to suggest as strongly as possible new offensives and never follow through. \n\nThe Belorussian border from Kyiv all the way west is also some of the least favorable offensive terrain you could find in all of Ukraine. It is densely wooded and marshy, with the famous Pinsk Marshes stretching along the Pripyat river for a substantial distance. That is one reason why the earlier Russian advance south from Pripyat was not prepared against as strongly as it might have been, because it was frankly stupid. The stringing out of supply lines concentrated along a small number of limited access roads was the inevitable result of a gamble on quickly taking Kyiv and linking up from the East.\n\nThroughout previous wars, Russia has made large comebacks by surprise attacks across swamps and woodlands, the Pinsk Marshes in particular. To do so now would be very on brand. The difference though is that Ukraine is not similar to previous Russian enemies, they have access to huge numbers of reserve troops that are best suited to digging in such places, and they have had a long time to prepare against exactly such an attack. Previously it has always been Russia with the numerical superiority in irregular forces, so they could count on enemies leaving flanks unguarded to allow advances elsewhere.\n\nThere is still the stretch of border between Chernihiv and Kharkiv, which Russia could attack through. The terrain is certainly more favorable, and Russia would have no issue supplying troops. But the same issues that plagued the initial invasion there would come back. Russia was forced to bypass many small cities along the way, because they didn't have the resources for prolonged sieges against even minimal forces. They have more infantry now possibly, but even still every city they siege along the way represents a combat multiplier for the defenders, and a potential point to wear them down. Against determined resistance they would need overwhelming force, otherwise they will just end up with interdiction in their rear again, or a slow advance that Ukraine could pivot forces to.",

That is one reason why the earlier Russian advance south from Pripyat was not prepared against as strongly as it might have been, because it was frankly stupid. The stringing out of supply lines concentrated along a small number of limited access roads was the inevitable result of a gamble on quickly taking Kyiv and linking up from the East.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout previous wars, Russia has made large comebacks by surprise attacks across swamps and woodlands, the Pinsk Marshes in particular. To do so now would be very on brand. The difference though is that Ukraine is not similar to previous Russian enemies, they have access to huge numbers of reserve troops that are best suited to digging in such places, and they have had a long time to prepare against exactly such an attack. Previously it has always been Russia with the numerical superiority in irregular forces, so they could count on enemies leaving flanks unguarded to allow advances elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>There is still the stretch of border between Chernihiv and Kharkiv, which Russia could attack through. The terrain is certainly more favorable, and Russia would have no issue supplying troops. But the same issues that plagued the initial invasion there would come back. Russia was forced to bypass many small cities along the way, because they didn&#39;t have the resources for prolonged sieges against even minimal forces. They have more infantry now possibly, but even still every city they siege along the way represents a combat multiplier for the defenders, and a potential point to wear them down. Against determined resistance they would need overwhelming force, otherwise they will just end up with interdiction in their rear again, or a slow advance that Ukraine could pivot forces to.</p>\n</div>",

The US is spending only its money, and a few thousand ATGMs and MANPADs cost much less than a few hundred tanks and planes. Artillery shells cost less than a few soldiers or transport vehicles.\n\nThe US economy is $23T and growing, Russia is $1.8T and shrinking. NATO is committed to not allowing Russia to succeed in a land grab in Europe, to avoid a WW2 situation. Russia has no significant allies.\n\nThe US can easily fund the war for many years without financial stress or a collapse in domestic support. Russia can probably stay in it for years if they choose, but the costs will be enormous. They'll run out of foreign reserves eventually, which will be painful. Iran may not be able to provide support much longer, given their domestic issues. China is suffering from COVID issues and energy price shocks (they're now falling behind the US in GDP growth).\n\nI don't know how this war will end, but I'm pretty confident that it won't come from an end to Western support. Either one side needs to achieve a convincing victory (hard for Ukraine, impossible for Russia), or both sides grow tired of fighting and come to a real peace agreement (unlikely after only 1 year of war, historically this takes several years or decades even). Or the wildcard candidate, Russian revolution or coup (unlikely currently, but could happen eventually).",

Russia has no significant allies.</p>\n\n<p>The US can easily fund the war for many years without financial stress or a collapse in domestic support. Russia can probably stay in it for years if they choose, but the costs will be enormous. They&#39;ll run out of foreign reserves eventually, which will be painful. Iran may not be able to provide support much longer, given their domestic issues. China is suffering from COVID issues and energy price shocks (they&#39;re now falling behind the US in GDP growth).</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know how this war will end, but I&#39;m pretty confident that it won&#39;t come from an end to Western support. Either one side needs to achieve a convincing victory (hard for Ukraine, impossible for Russia), or both sides grow tired of fighting and come to a real peace agreement (unlikely after only 1 year of war, historically this takes several years or decades even). Or the wildcard candidate, Russian revolution or coup (unlikely currently, but could happen eventually).</p>\n</div>",
