As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

They also seem to be distancing themselves from the operational aspect of Hamas attack. \n\n[Iran tells Hamas it will not enter the war with Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/11/15/iran-tells-hamas-will-not-enter-war-israel/)\n\n\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader told the head of Hamas in a face-to-face meeting in Tehran that his country would not enter the war with Israel and accused the terror group of not giving any prior warning of the Oct 7 attacks.\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei told Ismail Haniyeh that Iran \u2013 a longtime backer of Hamas \u2013 would continue to lend the group its political and moral support, but would not intervene directly, according to three Iranian and Hamas officials with knowledge of the discussions who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nThe supreme leader pressed Haniyeh to silence those voices in the Palestinian group publicly calling for Iran and its powerful Lebanese ally Hezbollah to join the battle against Israel in full force, a Hamas official told Reuters.\n\nHezbollah, too, was taken by surprise by Hamas\u2019s devastating assault last month that killed 1,200 Israelis. Its fighters were not even on alert in villages near the border that were front lines in its 2006 war with Israel, and had to be rapidly called up, three sources close to the Lebanese group said.\n\n\u201cWe woke up to a war,\u201d said a Hezbollah commander.\n\nThe unfolding crisis marks the first time that the so-called \u201caxis of resistance\u201d \u2013 a military alliance built by Iran over four decades to oppose Israeli and American power in the Middle East \u2013 has mobilised on multiple fronts at the same time.\n\nHezbollah has engaged in the heaviest clashes with Israel for almost 20 years. Iran-backed militias have targeted US forces in Iraq and Syria. Yemen\u2019s Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel.\n\n\nThe conflict is also testing the limits of the regional coalition whose members \u2013 which include the Syrian government, Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups from Iraq to Yemen \u2013 have differing priorities and domestic challenges.\n\nMohanad Hage Ali, an expert on Hezbollah at the Carnegie Middle East Centre think tank in Beirut, said Hamas\u2019s Oct 7 assault on Israel had left its axis partners facing tough choices in confronting an adversary with far superior firepower.\n\n\u201cWhen you wake up the bear with such an attack, it\u2019s quite difficult for your allies to stand in the same position as you.\u201d\n\nHamas, the ruling group of Gaza, is fighting for its survival against an avenging Israel, which vows to wipe it out and has launched a retaliatory onslaught on the tiny enclave that has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians.\n\nOn Oct 7, Mohammed Deif, Hamas\u2019s military commander, called on its axis allies to join the struggle. \u201cOur brothers in the Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iran, Yemen, Iraq and Syria, this is the day when your resistance unites with your people in Palestine,\u201d he said in an audio message.\n\nHints of frustration surfaced in subsequent public statements by Hamas leaders including Khaled Meshaal, who in an Oct 16 TV interview thanked Hezbollah for its actions thus far but said \u201cthe battle requires more\u201d .\n\nNonetheless, alliance leader Iran will not directly intervene in the conflict unless it is itself attacked by Israel or the US, according to six officials with direct knowledge of Tehran\u2019s thinking who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the matter.\n\nInstead, Iran\u2019s clerical rulers plan to continue using their axis network of armed allies, including Hezbollah, to launch rocket and drone attacks on Israeli and American targets across the Middle East, the officials said.\n\nThe strategy is a calibrated effort to demonstrate solidarity for Hamas in Gaza and stretch Israeli forces without becoming engaged in a direct confrontation with Israel that could draw in the US, they added.\n\n\u201cThis is their way of trying to create deterrence,\u201d said Dennis Ross, a former senior US diplomat specialising in the Middle East who now works at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank. \u201cA way of saying: \u2018Look, as long as you don\u2019t attack us, this is the way it will remain. But if you attack us, everything changes\u2019.\u201d\n\nIran has repeatedly said that all members of the alliance make their own decisions independently.\n\nThe Iranian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment about its response to the crisis and the role of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, a term of disputed origin that has been used by Iranian officials to describe the coalition.\n\nHamas did not immediately respond to questions sent to Haniyeh\u2019s media adviser, while Hezbollah also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHezbollah, the most powerful group in the axis, boasting 100,000 fighters, has exchanged fire with Israeli forces across the Lebanon-Israel border on an almost daily basis since Hamas went to war with Israel and more than 70 of its fighters have been killed.\n\nYet, like its backer Iran, Hezbollah has avoided an all-out confrontation.\n\nThe group has calibrated its attacks in a way that has kept the violence largely contained to a narrow strip of territory at the border, even as it has escalated those strikes in recent days, according to the people familiar with its thinking.\n\nOne of the sources said Hamas wanted Hezbollah to strike deeper into Israel with its massive arsenal of rockets but that Hezbollah believed this would lead Israel to lay waste to Lebanon without halting its attack on Gaza.\n\nHezbollah, which is also a political movement deeply involved in Lebanese government affairs, knows Lebanon can ill afford another war with Israel, more than four years into a financial crisis that has driven up poverty and hollowed out the country\u2019s governing institutions.\n\nLebanon took years to rebuild from the 2006 war, during which Israeli bombardment pounded the Hezbollah-controlled south of the country and destroyed swathes of its stronghold in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut.\n\nSayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s leader, said in a Nov 3 speech that Hamas had kept its attack on Israel a secret from its allies and this had ensured its success and not \u201cupset anyone\u201d in the axis. Hezbollah attacks at the Israeli border were unprecedented and amounted to \u201ca real battle\u201d, he said.",

ISIS killed far more Iraqis than Hamas has killed Israelis, and unlike Israel, the Iraqis were fighting to recapture one of their own cities.</p>\n</div>",

They've had decades of decades to do that.\n\nThe answer is that Hamas is weighing the pros and cons and chooses not to do it. Not because it is impossible because IDF is so invincible when it is actually present - it's because it does not serve the long term agenda of Hamas, which is both genocidal (inwards & outwards, apparently) and self serving (corruption, fake muslims, etc.). The terrorist that goes too far today gets wiped out tomorrow, so they choose their actions more carefully.\n\nSo Israelis come out of that \"safe\", right? They know the level of threat this particular group is, and they adjust their systems accordingly.\n\nHamas does the same (although it would be hard to claim Hamas cares about casualties or suffering of \"its\" people), but there's no practical need to get into it here.\n\nThe largest effect Oct 7th had was to completely burn this status quo to the ground. There is no more safety for Israelis, Hamas is willing to do anything, whatever serves its purposes, whatever it decides they may be. I would assume the actual purposes of this was to gain standing and to distract from their faults at home (in addition to the usual genocidal aims of Hamas).\n\nA predictable enemy is one that you manage, massage, manipulate, utilize.\n\nAn unpredictable enemy that numbers in the tens of thousands and enjoys support from \"its\" people (and state actors), is an enemy you wipe out *yesterday*.\nAnd if you don't, your electors who expect to feel some level of safety will get rid of you and elect someone who will. Perhaps rightfully so. No one I know would stand for this, but the world expects anything and everything, often including things it would never expect of itself.\n\nP.S We do not want to see what other right ring extremists could be found in Israel, Smotrich is quite a bit more than enough.\n\nEdit: I'm sure that what you said is also true - saving face, etc. But even if IDF was somehow perfect that day and the massacre still happened - we would be seeing the same scenario I suspect, due to what I mentioned above.  Saving face etc. might only partially explain things like extra-brutality of specific soldiers, some extra \"National Pride\" moments and so on, but not the urgent need to rid yourself of an unpredictable threat that would stop at nothing.\n\nEdit 2: ah apologies, I notice now you say \"That's part of the reason\".

As for the Ukrainian Marine Corps, while elements of all four of its brigades are in Kherson Oblast, it's only partly involved in the actions along the Dnipro. Most of the marine battalions are in the rear reconstituting, after this summer's battles. Rotations along the Dnipro may be frequent but I doubt there are more than a handful of Ukrainian companies in the left bank of the Dnipro at any given time. \n\nI have no idea whether at the beginning of October a decision was made to withdraw the 47th Mech from Robotyne and send the combat-capable elements of the brigade near Avdiivka or was it a choice made after the Russian offensive began for a lack of other options. Of course, it was strange to see them in Avdiivka. At the moment the 47th is holding the lines just west of the railway, between Stepove and the Coke Plant. It has not, in my opinion, the capabilities for a large counterattack towards Krasnahorivka and that is probably not why it was deployed to Avdiivka in first place. I don't consider plausible an Ukrainian willingness for a full-scale counterattack right now either. The 31st Mech (or at least elements of it) was around Avdiivka even before the offensive began, after being withdrawn in the summer from the Velyka Novosilka sector. All other brigades engaged in the Orikhiv sector during the summer are still there. The 23rd Mech, on the other hand, has disappeared from the radar since July after it had been involved in the actions in the western bank of Mokri Yaly along with the 31st.\n\nThere are some brigades that already existed in 2022 that have been lost track of since early 2023 (61st and 62nd Mech, 101st Protection of the General Staff - the 115th Mech, that was among them, was deployed in Kupyansk at the beginning of the autumn). Several of those formed during 2023 haven't been heard from since the news that they were undergoing training (13th Jager, 88th Mech, 5th Tank); the 44th Mech has yet to be deployed, the 42nd Mech has so far been marginally involved, save for a small reported fuck up in the Kreminna sector during the summer (it's supposed to field Strykers, but they have never been seen in action in their sector). The Khartiia Brigade of the Offensive Guard has never been deployed so far (the last among those from the OG). Some TDF brigades have been refitting since early 2023. On the four infantry brigades (formerly \"reserve rifle\", a new type of formation) created around June (141st, 142nd, 143rd, 144th) nothing more was heard, except that elements of the 142nd were in Avdiivka during the summer but then there were no more updates at all. Last month five (!) new mechanized brigades were created. Although Ukrainian stocks of T-64BVs and BMP-1s seem deeper than thought and they continue to reactivate vehicles from depots, the question remains as to how they are going to equip these brigades. Probably a mix of Soviet gear and Leopard 1A5s and MRAPs/M113s. Also they are going to need new 155mm guns in the future (which caliber's shells will have the largest increase in production). Several rifle battalions were created too during the summer. All other existing brigades IIRC have a known sector of deployment.\n\nWhen I know more about the tactical situation around Avdiivka (and else) I will try to post an update. In any case I agree that, speaking of reserves, the Russian situation is better than the Ukrainian one.",

The city largely sits on the old JFO line. But in 2022, when the northern flank was heavily threatened after a breakthrough, did the Ukrainians commit enough forces to hold the front lines and build multiple lines behind? Nope, they used them elsewhere, either the Donbas Salient defense, or operations in Kharkiv or Kherson.\n\nThen in early 2023, when the Russians broke through on the southern flank, did the Ukrainians race more reserves there to dig into secondary positions? Nope they sent them to Bakhmut.\n\nAt that point the pincers were close to closing. Did the Ukrainians send more reserves to dig more fall back positions? Nope, they used them to either go on the offensive or to defend the Kupyansk area, where they were more worried (but also lacked a defense in depth). \n\nIt's about mindset, the Ukrainians haven't really taken the Russian offensive capabilities seriously and haven't faced legit repercussions at a high level for defensive failures. The Russians adopted because they got a black eye at every level of leadership, civilian political and military, strategic to small unit level. Many laugh for what happened to them especially in the fall 2022, but that must have been a huge wake up call that they were in a real war and needed to take it seriously. One thing they NEEDED to take serious was defensive operations.\n\nWhy would Ukraine take it seriously? Sure, they lost defensively before but never really faced much pressure against the top military and civilian leadership. Oftentimes public blame would be pointed at the West for the old stand by, \"Ukraine was set up for failure because the West didn't give them x, y and z.\" The exception was Bakhmut, where they were publicly warned well in advance, but even that largely got brushed under the carpet with the huge focus shift on their upcoming counteroffensive. \n\nSo why invest the manpower, resources, and time when you can use those things to perform other tasks that you'd prefer. Remember, NOT having a manned defense in depth along the front, especially at critical areas like partial encirclements, allowed the UAF to have the freed up manpower and resources to fight many meatgrinder campaigns, offensive and defensive. That was a choice.\n\nThe Russians have that choice and also respond by choosing to fight in meatgrinders, but they took the time last year to build their defenses so now they're prepared and have freed up manpower and resources, giving them more opportunities to pursue other operations. \n\nThe Russians are now integrating newly taken ground directly into their operational level defensive scheme. That's fucking impressive. Say what you will about them, their crap training, how they're treated, their incompetence, but they are able to get their troops to immediately start a comprehensive and well thought out fortification plan IMMEDIATELY after taking a position. Which means it's built into the orders process now, \"IT WILL BE DONE,\" signed V. Gerasimov.\n\nI mean, they include an entire new section as part of a dismounted attack: assault, support, security, and now \"engineers,\" who can be extremely low skill infantrymen whose mission is to stay behind the assault element and dig in on the objective the assaulters take, or at designated terrain features as they advance (so even if the assault fails, they advance). Then they and the assault force are relieved by line company troops, to go prep for another assault somewhere else, while the line troops continue building the defenses as they prepare to resist a counterattack.\n\nPretty cool tactics like this that are coming out of this war, though they're mostly so specific to a purpose unique to this war that they can't work outside of positional warfare or even this conflict.",
