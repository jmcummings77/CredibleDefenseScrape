This is the 3rd new mech brigade this month. I have only Militaryland's word for this one, as I haven't found further detail yet, but Jerome is on top of this stuff.\n\nThis is speculation, but an echo pattern is apparent between new equipment pledges and unit formation. The 42nd and 43rd OMB were added as vehicles were pledged by Poland (and others) and the 44th appears soon after a major commitment by France. Leopard 1s sufficient for 2-3 battalions have been pledged, which lines up as well. The leaked documents in February made clear a direct correlation between pledges and new units, going so far as to detail which vehicles were destined for the 9 new brigades formed then, and it seems logical that this pattern would continue.\n\n\nEdit: Saw some interesting posts about a Swedish supplied brigade, returning to Ukraine this past week. It didn't note the brigade, but it did assert that 1)The training was outside of Ukraine and 2) this is the unit which received all the missing Swedish gear, ie. the Archer system 155mms and the CV90 IFVs (and 1 source stated they were getting Sweden's promised Leopard 2s as well) I can't get good confirmation of any of this, so I didn't want to start a fresh post on rumor quality intel, but felt it interesting enough for a postscript. \n\n For the life of me I can't discern which new brigade this could be. I guessed earlier that the CV-90s were going to the 13th Jaeger/Huntsmen, because they were the only new unit I knew Swedes were training (they just returned from Norway and Sweden so that fits too- They don't get a full battalion of armor but like AABs they should get a company, and Sweden is only supplying a company of L2s. ) I'll double down on my wild assed guess, but your guess is as good a mine.",

The strike on Kyiv that slightly damaged a patriot generator cost something like a hundred million dollars, for no strategic benefit.  It may be the plan on paper.

Success around Bakhmut would also provide a major morale boost for Ukraine and a serious blow to Russia, denying it the only military achievement that for months had seemed within its grasp.\n\nThe possible reversal of fortunes comes as Ukraine is preparing to mount a broader counteroffensive, aiming for a dramatic breakthrough in a war that has settled into a grueling slugfest, with much blood spilled but little ground gained. While the dynamics around Bakhmut are somewhat specific to that battle, Ukrainian commanders say they hope to build on the lessons learned there when they try to attack in other places along the 600-mile front line.\n\n\u201cWhen you retreat it is very difficult to stop,\u201d said Col.

Five months after first fighting their way into the city, the Russians hold about 90 percent of it.\n\nMaj. Oleksandr Pantsyrny, the commander of 24th separate assault battalion \u201cAidar,\u201d said that Ukraine has \u201cregained initiative on the flanks, to the north and south of the city.\u201d\n\nKonrad Muzyka, a defense analyst for Rochan Consulting, said the recent Ukrainian gains exposed \u201cfundamental Russian weaknesses: a lack of coordination between regular Russian formations and Wagner units, poor communication and morale.\u201d\n\nFor months, Ukraine has insisted that before starting its counteroffensive, it needs a major influx of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and other weapons from its allies.

The strategic shift that we saw under him back to an offensive mindset was not advantageous to Russian goals and the efforts were indeed too diffuse to achieve any significant victories. One must remember that Bakhmut is only one part of a defensive structure and that taking it is a precondition to breaching the actual line, and not a victory in itself.\n\nRussia needs to adapt its forces to the current war more desperately than it needs tactical victories right now and burning through men and materiel is not the way to do that.

If Russia can't match that, it should be on the defensive anyway.\n\nIf Russia can match or exceed it, then it also needs to be on the defensive to create its own forces. Very few decisive moves are possible with underequipped motor rifle regiments.

This is an attribute unfit for any commander and makes him a bad military leader. \n\nI would agree that with the tools provided, his offensives couldn't have been fought much better. But I am very much doubting that these offensives needed to be happen in the way they did or were needed at all. That's on him.

He has a generous stake of ownership in Russia's failure and if he really can't change anything, the proper action for an officer is to resign.\n\nI don't think he is the man for such an action and as such I do still feel comfortable in assigning at least partial blame in Russia's defeats to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that being said, I would like to make it absolutely clear that there are far too many variables and unknowns to people like me in this topic, for any truly decisive approximation of the truth.

If anyone could line me to a source for the internals of Russian military command, current psychological analysis of all involved, and their resources, then I (and probably the Ukrainian high command, provided they don&#39;t already get some top-notch updates from their/allied intelligence assets) would be very happy about it.</p>\n</div>",

Thats an odd take...\n\nI don't think it's impossible that they could have done better, but their original offensive plan was more likely to produce a decisive victory than a focused attack on the Donbas/south. \n\nI have a few reasons for this: \n\n1. Ukraine expected a focused attack on the Donbas/south, and much of its delayed mobilization and the surprise the Russians achieved in the first few days was because their dispersed deployment made the Ukrainians uncertain when/where an attack would happen or if it would definitely happen. Russia concentrating the resources of multiple MD against the Donbas/south would have produced a much high level of Ukrainian readiness than their chosen plan.\n\n2. As I said, Ukraine's planning/expectation was for a focused assault on the Donbas. Russia caught them flat-footed but couldn't capitalize on it. Fighting the first few days as-planned would have been very beneficial for the Ukrainians. \n\n3. Ukraine's ~7ish brigades available from the north would have been adequate to prevent or contain a full Russian breakthrough. While Russia could have used its larger forces to advance to the line achieved historically, this would have been done through frontal attacks and take heavy losses as in the Summer 2022 campaign. As the Ukrainians had sufficient ammunition for the first months of the war, Russia wouldn't have the same firepower advantage as they did in Summer 2022. In essence, the Ukrainians would have benefitted more from creating a dense front than the Russians. \n\n4. Ukraine's effective defense was focused on dispersing and avoiding Russia's superior firepower along the border. With Russia's poor targeting, intelligence gathering, and C&C, I don't think focusing that firepower on a smaller area would have been decisive.\n\nBasically, a focused attack in the Donbas/south makes it much more likely the front stabilizes sooner (because of higher Ukrainian readiness and more formations) and the Russians are forced to attempt to advance via costly frontal attacks against an enemy with equal firepower. With the political resistance to mobilizing remaining the same, this puts them in the same attrition death spiral which caused them to lose ground in 2022. Russia could afford (in the short term) to lose armor in ambushes/due to supply problems but not infantry from assaulting Ukrainian units. \n\nI'd say that with the political constraints of 2022, Russia was better off going for a quick decisive victory than committing itself to a battle of attrition from the start. This plan failed due to a mix of poor execution, structural weaknesses, and exceptional Ukrainian resistance.",

But you certainly saw something like that with the deployment of elements of the 53rd Mech, 60th Mech, and 92nd Mech to Bakhmut while the rest remained elsewhere. \n\nOn the other hand, the high quality new formations sent in February were committed as entire units (maybe not the 67th at first, but definitely the other 3). \n\nLike I said, I think the composition of what Ukraine sent in supports the argument that they didn't have other high-quality, combat-ready reserves. The intelligence leaks and other reporting largely confirm that these were formations specifically reserved for a counteroffensive. Not forces I believe Ukraine would have deployed if there wasn't an alternative. \n\nAnyway, my argument is less that Ukraine has no reserves and more that Bakhmut drew in many reserves (partially or fully) and that the January-March crisis was a very real period of vulnerability. Ukraine committed formations it didn't want to commit and couldn't replace for several months. \n\nThe Russian \"winter offensive\" needs to be seen in the context of them trying and failing (badly) to capitalize on this temporary crisis. Rather than Surovikin = defense, Gerasimov = offense, I see it more as a dispute over how best to conduct the defense, waiting for Ukraine to commit its reserves vs attracting them prematurely, and how the \"Bakhmut model\" could be applied elsewhere.",

Multiply your lower bound KIA by that coefficient and you get a pretty good final total.  \n\nHigh MIA numbers would skew the data here but no where near enough to give us a 4x difference between independent estimates and Ukrainian numbers.",

Nobody assumes Russia hits the West's KIA:WIA ratios - the US was at 1:7 in the Gulf War and lately is often considerably in excess of 1:10. What people frequently do assert is that there is no reason _whatsoever_ to believe Russia has collapsed past the historic norm of around 1:3. The implied total casualties with that ratio in mind and the deleterious effect that those would have had on Russia's ability to prosecute the war, contrasted with their evident ongoing ability to do so, is why people disbelieve Ukraine's KIA figures.\n\nTo expand on that latter point; the implication of 200k KIA at the historic 1:3 KIA:WIA ratio is 800k casualties total; a number in excess of the entire invasion force, the 300k mobilised troops _and_ those troops conscripted through the normal channels since then. _Obviously_ that can not be true. Even if we grant for a moment the idea that there could be a 1:1 KIA:WIA ratio (and remember there is absolutely no reason to do that) that's still 400k casualties; over 50% of the force Russia has committed to the fight.

The US Army's \"tooth to tail\" in Iraqi for example was something like 1:4 - one combat soldier for every 4 supporting personnel. In other words, of the ~6-700k soldiers whom Russia has committed to this war probably less than 33% are actual combat troops. Even the utterly unbelievable 1:1 ratio implies the loss of every \"tooth\" - every fighting soldier - committed, and then a whole bunch of support troops like cooks and mechanics and logisticians and drivers on top.\n\nTo be clear though; nobody is baffled by their estimates - they're just straight up lying about it for propaganda reasons.

Practical deployments differ to some degree, for both practical and historical reasons, but it's generally a safe bet that any ISP operating in a country with a well-regulated telecom industry has the infrastructure. It would work about the same in Ukraine as it does in Australia.\n\n> The dialup part is referring to international calls which were used successfully during the previous Iran uprising to bypass internet shutdowns.\n\nYep, cross-border dial-up is a lot harder to cut. I've sort of excluded it from my other post here simply because it's not something that someone who's casually snapped a few photos and casually wants to post them would do.\n\nMost people just give up if they can't access Telegram or whatever -- going from \"I have this phone that won't do data connections anymore, weird!?\" to \"okay, let's try a dial-up connection over an international call line\" is the kind of thing people who *really* want to post things do, because it's e.g. their job, or some ideological imperative or whatever. It's not particularly hard, but it can take at least a few hours. There's no reason to do it if you can get Internet by getting on the first bus you see and riding it for half an hour.",

        "body": "[Revealed: Russian Neo-Nazi Leader Obtained UK Missiles In Ukraine\n](https://declassifieduk.org/revealed-russian-neo-nazi-leader-obtained-uk-missiles-in-ukraine/)\n\nThe title is *slightly* misleading: the individual is a neo-nazi from Belarus, who moved to Ukraine in 2014 and is part of Azov.\n\nI'm posting this because I do think it is relevant news. I understand there is a whole Thing about excessively going \"Azov did a bad\", but like I do think at a basic level we should be able to acknowledge: people like this existing *does not, and never will, justify the war*. That doesn't mean the fact they continue to run around can be excused. As the article itself says:\n\n> The revelations do not justify Vladimir Putin\u2019s claim that his illegal invasion is \u2018de-Nazifying\u2019 Ukraine. The Kremlin has neo-Nazis among its own troops, and Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish. But while Russian forces have rightly received significant scrutiny in the UK media, there has been scant coverage of who exactly in Ukraine is receiving Britain\u2019s multi-billion pound arms package. \n\nAnyway, onto the article itself:\n\n> Sergei Korotkikh acquired anti-tank launchers from Britain, despite being accused of beheading a migrant when he led a neo-Nazi group in Russia. UK-supplied weapons have reached a range of far-right forces in Ukraine, our investigation finds.\n\n> Declassified has been investigating Sergei Korotkikh, who is originally from Belarus. Around 20 years ago, he founded a Russian neo-Nazi group \u2013 the National Socialist Society. It spread fear in Moscow by targeting darker-skinned guest workers from the Caucasus and central Asia. The group was banned and its members convicted of dozens of racist murders. Korotkikh is alleged to have killed two migrants in 2007, beheading one of the victims \u2013 Shamil Odamanov \u2013 on camera beneath a swastika flag.\n\n> He denies the allegations, which featured in the multi-award winning documentary Credit for Murder by Israeli director Vlady Antonevicz. Korotkikh was even reported to have links to Russian intelligence and police, who may have recruited him as an agent shortly after the killings. He would not be charged with murder until 2021, by which time he had long since left the country.\n\nThe links to Russian intelligence thing [goes to a Kyiv Post article](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/7145), which you can find there. I think this is a fairly important part since it obviously shows that the Russian stuff about denazification really isn't all it's claimed to be.\n\n> He wrote: \u201cWe have so many weapons that we are literally littered with shells and rockets. There is, of course, a special buzz when you literally ride the NLAW.\u201d On camera, he described having NLAWs as \u201cincomparable male pleasure\u201d. A few hours later, he posted a scene from the movie Hot Fuzz, where police find a farm shed full of weapons. He commented: \u201cIn every house in Ukraine after the war\u201d with a grinning emoji.\n\n> Korotkikh appears to have used a Kyiv sports club as his arms depot, posting a video the next day with two NLAWs propped up against the wall behind him. By the end of March, footage shows he had at least five NLAWs stored in a gym.\n\n> Throughout this time, he posted gruesome and racist messages on Telegram. In one, he shared a photo of a severed head in a crate, writing: \u201cThe Ukrainians, unlike the Russian command, are trying to return Putin\u2019s soldiers to their families. It is not always possible to return the whole thing, but, nevertheless\u2026\u201d \n\n> In another video addressed to Chechen troops deployed by Putin to invade Ukraine, he said: \u201cWe will play football with your heads when we cut them off.\u201d \n\n> Other posts show Korotkikh criticising Russia for allegedly using Arab mercenaries from Syria and \u201cblack cannon fodder from the Central African Republic\u201d, saying: \u201cKyivan Rus against the Asian Horde. The masks have been dropped. This only makes it easier for real white Europeans to fight.\u201d\n\n> The posts confirm that his hatred of Russian minorities has persisted, viewing the war in Ukraine as a battle for white supremacy. In other photos on his Telegram channel, which has 55,000 subscribers, he can be seen wearing a Black Sun symbol \u2013 originally from Nazi Germany \u2013 on his body armour.\n\nOn the NLAW sourcing itself: \n\n> The NLAWs in Korotkikh\u2019s arsenal can be traced back to those supplied by Britain. A reference number, 1H2/Y31/S/12/GB/5126, is visible on the box of one launcher. It matches codes printed on other crates that Ukrainian media said were delivered by the UK in February 2022.\n\n> Linda \u00c5kerstr\u00f6m, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, which monitors arms firms like Saab, commented: \u201cEven if you fully support exporting arms to Ukraine in light of the brutal Russian attack, there is also the need to acknowledge the risks involved. Arms ending up in the hands of criminals is one of them. The risk that arms will flow out of Ukraine to other armed conflicts or into criminal activities once that war stops is real and must be addressed.\u201d\n\n> Dr Sam Perlo-Freeman, a researcher at Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), told Declassified: \u201cThe potential for western arms supplied to Ukraine to fall into the wrong hands \u2013 whether far-right pro-Ukrainian forces, criminal gangs, or diverted to conflicts in other countries, has been a major concern from the beginning. This very troubling case shows that the UK government is not doing enough to guard against this. While the EU and US have taken some measures to monitor what happens to arms to Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has refused even to confirm or deny if it has any such measures or plans. This is not good enough. The UK government must set out clearly what it is doing to prevent diversion of weapons supplied to Ukraine, which will likely become a far greater problem for Ukraine and the rest of Europe when this horrific war eventually ends.\u201d\n\n> British defence minister James Heappey has previously admitted to MPs \u201cit is highly likely that members of the Azov battalion have had access to UK supplied anti-tank weapons,\u201d but he claimed \u201crigorous risk assessments\u201d and \u201cappropriate mitigation measures\u201d had been undertaken. Heappey partly justified British arms reaching Azov militants by saying: \u201cSince being made a part of the Ukrainian National Guard in 2014, the battalion has made some efforts to de-politicise. All founding members left the battalion and formed a political party.\u201d \n\n> Biletsky was elected to parliament in 2014 but lost his seat at Ukraine\u2019s last election in 2019. Far-right parties only scraped 2% of the vote in that poll. But Biletsky\u2019s recent claims to be commanding Azov-affiliated armed units in Bakhmut indicates that Azov founders are still heavily involved in Ukraine\u2019s military \u2013 and remain an important power bloc in the war torn country.  That, coupled with figures like Korotkikh having access to British arms, could give UK police and MI5 cause for concern about potential blowback.\n\nI have cut stuff out from the article: there's some fairly bog standard reporting on Azov that isn't in need of being repeated here, and also just for brevity's sake. You can read the article itself if you want to see that, I think it's a good one that addresses a genuine issue (rather nasty people are getting access to weapons) while making clear that this doesn't justify anything Russia does (again, if the Kyiv Post thing it links is any indication, Russia happily tolerated him). I fully support Ukraine's fight, I simply think they could stand to do a better job of dealing with people like Korotkikh or at the very least not letting too many weapons into his hands.",
