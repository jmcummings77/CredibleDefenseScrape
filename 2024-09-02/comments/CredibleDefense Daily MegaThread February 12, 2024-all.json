Over the years, several people who had proven Hamas links were fired or left the agency, including after the 2014 investigation, current and former officials said.\n\n>But, Mr. Lazzarini added, \u201cOur employees are part of the social fabric of Gaza and its ecosystem.

The international community has already accepted this and is currently working towards this outcome.\n\nI\u2019ve yet to see any indications that Israel has any interest in a permanent ceasefire with Hamas. There\u2019s been a lot of talk online about how Israel is going to give up and letting Hamas retake power, but I\u2019ve yet to see any actual evidence of this. Honestly, at this point it feels like a narrative that people are attached to no matter the facts on the ground. When the ceasefire proposals were discussed a few days back, there were a number of people taking it as evidence that Israel was giving up and going to let Hamas retake control. But that proposal was flatly rejected by Israel.\n\nI think the fact that so much of the Hamas victory talk is focused on Israel eventually giving up is a pretty good indication that the other ways to stop Israel have failed to materialize. We\u2019re even getting fewer discussions about the \u201cHamas underground army.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that things are going to be smooth sailing for Israel, and it\u2019s still unclear what their post-invasion plan is (though they\u2019ve been able to occupy many of the areas for months so far, so maybe they plan to continue doing so for the near future).

Clearly they expected heavy blows in response but the preponderance of evidence suggests that even they are taken aback by the intensity and duration of the military operations. They were quite literally whining about the IDF abandoning \"roof knocking\" in the first week of the war.\n\n>Deterrence is literally deterring attacks, you keep trying to redefine it in that paragraph.\n\nAnd how do you deter attacks? Consider nuclear deterrence, you deter a nuclear attack by the knowledge that you will deliver a mortal blow to your opponent in retaliation. Hamas is not \"suicidal\" as an organization. It may send its fighters on literal or functional suicide missions, but the organization and the leadership are very invested in their continued survival. \n\n>If they see wanton destruction of gaza as a goal of the attack, then it is impossible that it is deterrence for them.\n\nHaving Gaza be obliterated was clearly not the goal of the attack. That's the goal of the attack if you insist on redefining objective reality to fit some manner of hurr durr the resistance is winning narrative.

Clearly they expected heavy blows in response but the preponderance of evidence suggests that even they are taken aback by the intensity and duration of the military operations. They were quite literally whining about the IDF abandoning &quot;roof knocking&quot; in the first week of the war.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deterrence is literally deterring attacks, you keep trying to redefine it in that paragraph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And how do you deter attacks? Consider nuclear deterrence, you deter a nuclear attack by the knowledge that you will deliver a mortal blow to your opponent in retaliation. Hamas is not &quot;suicidal&quot; as an organization. It may send its fighters on literal or functional suicide missions, but the organization and the leadership are very invested in their continued survival. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If they see wanton destruction of gaza as a goal of the attack, then it is impossible that it is deterrence for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having Gaza be obliterated was clearly not the goal of the attack. That&#39;s the goal of the attack if you insist on redefining objective reality to fit some manner of hurr durr the resistance is winning narrative. Hamas has been desperately trying to end the war ever since the IDF moved into Khan Younis and their defenses folded with ease compared to Gaza City. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, Israel conducting this war in a way that doesn&#39;t turn the world against them is deterrence, because that thwarts one of the goals of the attack and potential similar attacks in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s like a mental illness definition of deterrence, in that you would quite literally have to be mentally ill to make that argument.

IMHO they have always had the ability, its a question of inclination.  Things have shifted in the Israeli population, many who once considered peace a viable option no longer do. \n\nI think there is an inclination to deal with the problem on a level we have not seen in generations.\n\n> The examples of Germany and Japan were brought up because they show a model for successfully turning an enemy into a friend. \n\n>Do you think such a positive outcome is likely from an Israeli occupation of Gaza?\n\nLikely?  Probably not, at least until the status quo with the Iranian theocracy and the Muslim world shifts.  If there is increased normalization with Saudi Egypt and other members of the Muslim world, I think it is very much possible.  Normalization was happening and may still happen, but have been derailed, I would argue this is a key reason for the conflict kicking off.\n\nI'd say in the long term there is a decent chance Gaza can become a site for tourism, deep history and beautiful beaches.  A Singapore-like model could bring prosperity to the population.  Obviously, this would take a long time and international buy in.

It had very considerable losses in Bakhmut during the summer but is being reconstituted with contract soldiers - they are looking for infantrymen and stormtroopers: https://t. me/ordenbat/58\n\nSeveral territorial regiments were, however, likely cannibalized and disbanded. Lots of them were sent to the front within two weeks from the partial mobilization law, so we can guess what training they had. But there was a huge need for reinforcements after all. As for the summer counteroffensive, numerous regiments of the Territorial Forces had very large losses, a significant number of the subunits of the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th Army lost combat capability (with many new recruits arriving in them during the clashes to replenish losses), and even elite units such as the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and the 22nd and 45th Spetsnaz GRU Brigades were badly damaged.\n\nQuality of troops and individual training do remain a weak point. Russian sources as well criticize the training of the soldiers, although it must be said that per Ukrainian sources (e.g. the [\"Skala\" Battalion](https://kyivindependent.com/avdiivka-defense-uncertain-as-ukraine-struggles-with-fortification), active in Avdiivka) the skills demonstrated by the Russians during this period in Avdiivka are better than those of the Wagner's convicts in Bakhmut, which may indicate better training and more capable leaders (probably former Wagnerite veterans of the urban battle of Bakhmut).\n\nHowever, there are indeed many cases of contract soldiers who signed up and by the next month were dead or missing. Two-weeks trainings are still very, very common for those who are replacements and are sent to make up for losses in existing units. Although maybe it's usually people who have had some training in the past (e.g. in the military service) and already knew how to shoot, maintain a weapon, etc. In any case it's short in any respect. Even more elite units such as the \"Veterans\" Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade offer just two weeks of basic training for volunteers who join, possibly extendable if the recruit is not deemed ready or a specific role has been chosen (e.g. AGS-17 operator and so on). The same goes for other units such as the \"Akhmat\" detachments. The situation may be somewhat different for recruits destined for new formations, whose training seems to be longer, more emphasis is placed on collective training, combined arms etc. \n\nAnd it should be mentioned that sometimes existing units, after being rotated to the rear from the front line, conduct additional training (e.g. to improve assault techniques), also in order to integrate new recruits into the unit.

        "body": "I dont know if any publication has done any detailed breakdown and analysis on it but what would be a credible estimate for the number of Ukrainians currently within its (controlled) borders? I assume pre 2022 permanent residents w/o Crimea minus a large % of the population of the as of now Russia controlled regions , minus refugees to Europe , minus ethnic Russians that emigrated or where stuck to Russia before or after the war, minus 100k in deaths would give a good estimate but its hard to make out a census for most of these numbers.\n\nThe biggest Issue is the pre war permanent residents in Ukraine. Most numbers i have seen are extrapolated from a decades old census of \\~42+ million but i have also seen that due to continued immigration its likely that the number of people within Ukrainian borders pre invasion could be noticably lower. Ella Libanova, the director of the Ptoukha Institute for Demography and Social Studies at the National Academy of Sciences said that as of 2020 it could be as low as 35million\n\n>Another part of the problem for Kyiv is that it has antiquated and unreliable statistics, making it harder to formulate policies to address the significant outbound flow of citizens. Ukraine\u2019s population stands at a little more than 48 million\u2014or at least it did in 2001, when the most recent census was taken. An array of political crises, conflicts, and more urgent issues have meant that, time and again, successive Ukrainian governments have kicked the can down the road when talk has turned to carrying out a full count of the number of people in the country.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I dont know if any publication has done any detailed breakdown and analysis on it but what would be a credible estimate for the number of Ukrainians currently within its (controlled) borders? I assume pre 2022 permanent residents w/o Crimea minus a large % of the population of the as of now Russia controlled regions , minus refugees to Europe , minus ethnic Russians that emigrated or where stuck to Russia before or after the war, minus 100k in deaths would give a good estimate but its hard to make out a census for most of these numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest Issue is the pre war permanent residents in Ukraine. Most numbers i have seen are extrapolated from a decades old census of ~42+ million but i have also seen that due to continued immigration its likely that the number of people within Ukrainian borders pre invasion could be noticably lower. Ella Libanova, the director of the Ptoukha Institute for Demography and Social Studies at the National Academy of Sciences said that as of 2020 it could be as low as 35million</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another part of the problem for Kyiv is that it has antiquated and unreliable statistics, making it harder to formulate policies to address the significant outbound flow of citizens. Ukraine\u2019s population stands at a little more than 48 million\u2014or at least it did in 2001, when the most recent census was taken. An array of political crises, conflicts, and more urgent issues have meant that, time and again, successive Ukrainian governments have kicked the can down the road when talk has turned to carrying out a full count of the number of people in the country.

Can anyone with a strong familiarity chime in on whether they believe North Korea supplied more artillery to Russia in 2 months, than **Europe** supplied to Ukraine over the course of the war?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**From War on the Rocks- \"Adaptation at the Front, and the Big Picture in Ukraine\" Nov 21, 2023\n@ the 26:00 mark**, they discuss Russia's materiel advantage in 2024 regarding artillery, drones, cruise missiles/long range drones, etc.\n\nSuggests Ukraine needs to entrench\n\nSuggests/suspects Russia got more artillery from NK in the last 2 months, than Ukraine received from **Europe** over the entire war.\n\nGoes on to say (29:45) that he believes the materiel advantage is not decisive. Doesn't suspect a durable stalemate on the ground/either side committing to a positional war. Suspects more attrition. \n\nBelieves the war will not be stalemated- Russian advantage in 2024 will compound/become more significant in 2025. There won't be a frozen conflict - Russia has the advantage in that situation. \n\nAlso expects Russia to go on the offensive prematurely/without preparation. Russia holds all of Luhansk/half of Donetsk. Poor gains (meters/kilometers). Gerasimov's job was to take the other half of the Donbass- Got to Bahkmuht, lost the part of Kharkiv essential for offensive operations. \n\nExpects more Russian offensives. More Russian attacks on critical infrastructure/power grid (I don't understand this. I was under the impression they crippled Ukraine's electrical network to their desire, with that large Shahed attack (Oct/Nov 2022 IIRC). That was around the time everyone was Chicken-Littling about electrical switches or ... I forget the term, but like some smaller, sub-node, de-localized, component of the electrical grid which could be easily targeted & was in limited supply, like a step down/up transformer or something.\n\nI didn't even catch the news that all 24 heads of the Ukrainian mobilization offices were fired at some point.\n\nRussia may be holding off on another partial mobilization until the (Russian) March Presidential election. They were able to mobilize 300k, were able to replace losses/regenerate combat power. Believes they need to form more units in significant numbers, and rotate more units, if they want to go on the offensive. (He was wrong, thought Russia would need to partially mobilize in the Fall 2023 - but they were successful enough in national recruitment, and didn't suffer enough losses to Ukraine). Suspects Russia can sustain the defensive as they currently are.\n\nThinks Ukraine can at best reconstitute, entrench, free up parts of the force, fix training issues, learn from 2023 offensive mistakes, build stockpiles/invest in local production, attend to parts/maintenance. So they can create a possibility for a significant advantage in late 2025. Unlikely to resource another offensive. - Thinks Russia will continue attacking more prematurely, and it would be easier to break their offensive potential through Ukraine's defense, then regenerate, and attack.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe only things I found to conflict with my own interpretation or understanding of the war were NK artillery supplies (I just find it hard to believe that NK would release a significant number of shells. Maybe they were aged beyond their use. I wonder what they would value in exchange? A modern successor to their Russian-aided rocket program from 50+ years ago? I wonder what their goals are now, and if they need foreign assistance? I guess it always reduces cost/time, and afaik that was already demonstrated in their rocket program. Do they want assistance in their sub-launched missiles, their US-targeting missiles, or satellites/other space related programs? I guess if they want to attack SK, all they need to do is threaten/hold off the US with a reliable ICBM, while they maintain the nuclear advantage + nationalism over SK? Seems real odd/extremely imbalanced if the US is \"allowing\" Russia to supply another country with the capability to nuke the US ??? So likely something else?). And he seems to believe Russia has been limited by means in their take down of Ukrainian infrastructure - whereas I believe it is by choice. I don't have any input or opinion on military strategy or capability regarding actual fighting.\n\nI also don't have a breakdown of suspected long range munitions/missiles/etc. given to Ukraine by Europe vs the US/US-paid countries.\n\n*oh, the Arms Control Wonk Podcast \"North Korea's New Satellite\" discusses satellites a bit- they discuss their imaging satellite used for targeting purposes (hosts' suggest Guam/Japan. I guess there was a news release through NK KCNA claiming they had captured images of Anderson AFB in Guam. I don't really see the value beyond propaganda/populace threats of naming Guam/Japan - what value or difference would it make if NK nuked Guam? I guess it would be irradiated/removed from the battlefield for some period of time [months? years? I assume it depends on the bomb they chose] and you could go on to allude to Chinese opportunism regarding Taiwan, or worse. But that's probably not CD). They don't really suggest collaboration related to the Ukrainian War, but do suggest prior/recent Chinese/Russian assistance or cooperation; nothing really beyond prior speculation.",

Unlikely to resource another offensive. - Thinks Russia will continue attacking more prematurely, and it would be easier to break their offensive potential through Ukraine&#39;s defense, then regenerate, and attack.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The only things I found to conflict with my own interpretation or understanding of the war were NK artillery supplies (I just find it hard to believe that NK would release a significant number of shells. Maybe they were aged beyond their use. I wonder what they would value in exchange? A modern successor to their Russian-aided rocket program from 50+ years ago? I wonder what their goals are now, and if they need foreign assistance? I guess it always reduces cost/time, and afaik that was already demonstrated in their rocket program. Do they want assistance in their sub-launched missiles, their US-targeting missiles, or satellites/other space related programs? I guess if they want to attack SK, all they need to do is threaten/hold off the US with a reliable ICBM, while they maintain the nuclear advantage + nationalism over SK? Seems real odd/extremely imbalanced if the US is &quot;allowing&quot; Russia to supply another country with the capability to nuke the US ??? So likely something else?). And he seems to believe Russia has been limited by means in their take down of Ukrainian infrastructure - whereas I believe it is by choice. I don&#39;t have any input or opinion on military strategy or capability regarding actual fighting.</p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t have a breakdown of suspected long range munitions/missiles/etc. given to Ukraine by Europe vs the US/US-paid countries.</p>\n\n<p>*oh, the Arms Control Wonk Podcast &quot;North Korea&#39;s New Satellite&quot; discusses satellites a bit- they discuss their imaging satellite used for targeting purposes (hosts&#39; suggest Guam/Japan. I guess there was a news release through NK KCNA claiming they had captured images of Anderson AFB in Guam. I don&#39;t really see the value beyond propaganda/populace threats of naming Guam/Japan - what value or difference would it make if NK nuked Guam? I guess it would be irradiated/removed from the battlefield for some period of time [months? years? I assume it depends on the bomb they chose] and you could go on to allude to Chinese opportunism regarding Taiwan, or worse. But that&#39;s probably not CD). They don&#39;t really suggest collaboration related to the Ukrainian War, but do suggest prior/recent Chinese/Russian assistance or cooperation; nothing really beyond prior speculation.</p>\n</div>",
