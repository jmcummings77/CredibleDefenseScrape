                "body": "The issue that troop densities, on both sides, are just not high enough to stop men from slipping through the lines, especially at night. Even in WWII, in nearly the same area hundreds of thousands of Soviets escaped far tighter encirclements by dropping their rifles, bailing out of their tanks, and legging it. \n\nBut troops doing that are obviously no longer combat capable. Above and beyond the material loss those troops will just not be capable of returning to service for the next battle. Low morale, loss of officers, loss of discipline, high desertion. They\u2019ll be basically worthless. \n\nRussell Weigley argued in his book on the Civil War that one of US Grants smarter moves was to release the prisoners caught after the Vicksburg siege. The men were sick, bedraggled, and disenchanted with the war effort. Many filtered through the countryside after the battle and told people about how the war was lost, how the south was doomed, about how bad the battle was, etc. Those who returned to service drug their commands down, helping contribute to the overall paralysis of the Confederate regional command after the surrender.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The issue that troop densities, on both sides, are just not high enough to stop men from slipping through the lines, especially at night. Even in WWII, in nearly the same area hundreds of thousands of Soviets escaped far tighter encirclements by dropping their rifles, bailing out of their tanks, and legging it. </p>\n\n<p>But troops doing that are obviously no longer combat capable. Above and beyond the material loss those troops will just not be capable of returning to service for the next battle. Low morale, loss of officers, loss of discipline, high desertion. They\u2019ll be basically worthless. </p>\n\n<p>Russell Weigley argued in his book on the Civil War that one of US Grants smarter moves was to release the prisoners caught after the Vicksburg siege. The men were sick, bedraggled, and disenchanted with the war effort. Many filtered through the countryside after the battle and told people about how the war was lost, how the south was doomed, about how bad the battle was, etc. Those who returned to service drug their commands down, helping contribute to the overall paralysis of the Confederate regional command after the surrender.

        "body": "[Conflict International Team report is out. ](https://notes.citeam.org/a5ThxJ9HJ75)\n\n**Summary for September 28-30 (until 15:00)**\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Further, the issue of annexing the occupied territories to Russia will be considered at a meeting of the State Duma (October 3) and then the Federation Council (October 4). Our team considers this another stage of escalation.\n\nThe situation on the front line\n\nUkrainian forces are expanding the bridgehead east of Kupyansk and liberating new territories. On the morning of September 30, visual confirmation of the liberation of Yampol by Ukrainian troops appeared, the day before it was reported by the pro-Russian telegram channel Rybar. Accordingly, now it is possible to state the operational entourage of the Lyman (until 2016 it was called \"Red Estuary\").\n\nRecall that a few days ago, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that the Ukrainian counteroffensive on Lyman failed and more than 70 Ukrainian servicemen were killed.\n\nIf the Armed Forces of Ukraine manage to liberate Zarechnaya, it will be possible to talk no longer about the operational environment, but about the boiler.\n\nMany pro-Russian sources call the current situation a betrayal, as what happened to the Russian group in the Kharkiv direction is repeated.\n\nAlso in recent days, there has been evidence of the presence of mobilized at the front - they are sent to build a defense line in Svatovo.\n\nOn the morning of September 30, at the entrance to the city of Zaporozhye, a column of civil cars that were driving to pro-Russian territory was struck (presumably volunteers or people who take out loved ones or their property from the occupied territories). According to the latest data, 23 people were killed and 34 injured as a result of the attack on this column. Judging by the funnel, a very powerful projectile arrived, but it is not yet known which one.\n\nWe do not yet have enough data to judge who exactly carried out this blow, but the Russian side has already been seen in such strikes on civilian columns.\n\nRussian troops fired at again:\n\nDnipro (on the night of September 28-29), a family died: two children, a mother, a grandmother and a small dog, the father of the family serves as an artilleryman in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and is now near Lyman;\na motor transport company in Dnipro (on the night of September 29-30), 52 buses burned down and another 98 were damaged;\nbus stop in Nikolaev (September 29), 2 people died, 12 wounded, photos of consequences.\nMobilization news in Russia\n\nThe head of Dagestan Sergey Malikov issued a decree on the mobilization of 13,000 people, in case of failure threatening all responsible sending to the front. To solve this problem, the Derbent authorities sent a police car to drive around the city and report through a loudspeaker that all men should urgently come to the military registration and enlistment office with a passport and a military ID.\n\nAfter Vladimir Putin's appeal, who demanded to call only on those who met the criteria, Sergei Malikov was outraged by the actions of Derbent officials and forced the local military commissar to publicly apologize.\n\nWe do not see anything surprising in the fact that complete chaos is happening in the card indexes of military registration and enlistment offices, because the last mobilization was back in the 40s of the last century, and no one was ready for the current one.\n\nHaving got acquainted with the problems of the mobilization that began, the President of Russia dismissed the Deputy Minister for Logistics.\n\nIn order to somehow prevent the flow of men fleeing from mobilization, mobile points of the military registration and enlistment office were deployed on the Russian-Georgian border, where those wishing to leave are given summons, after which they are not released from Russia on this basis. Now similar points have been deployed in the Leningrad region on the border with Finland and in the Astrakhan region on the border with Kazakhstan.\n\nNews about the 3rd Army Corps\n\nThere are comments about the 3rd Army Corps from various Russian sources. Many note that there was almost no real training in 3 AK. Seeing the quality of training, some of those enrolled in the corps immediately resigned. Another significant part was fired after the visit of Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov for telling him how bad everything is. Thus, this army corps turned into a crowd of untrained people on the latest technology, which they practically do not know how to manage. They are also now very angry, as their short-term contracts have turned into indefinite ones, and some also do not receive the required payments.\n\nAfter the appearance of 3 AK units on the front line, the tactical sign of the corps - \"bear's paw in a circle\" became known. Earlier we saw such a sign on the echelon of equipment in Vladimir.\n\nOne of the separatist field commanders Khodakovsky speaks unflatteringly about the units of 3 AK, comparing them to a free-released animal born and raised in a zoo.\n\nUkrainian columnist Konstantin Mashovets writes that part 3 of the army corps is deploying in positions near Ugledar and refers more to the Mariupol direction than to Melitopol.\n\nOfficial American sources specify that 18 HIMARS MLRS units, the transfer of which was announced in the last aid package, will be delivered in a few years (when they are produced).\n\nSouth Korea will transfer $2.9 billion in military assistance to Ukraine. It includes, among other things, Chiron MANPADS and missiles for them designed to shoot down low-flying (less than 7 km) aircraft.\n\nThe first results of the use of the \"Pritula satellite\" - a satellite that was acquired by the \"Charity Fund of Sergei Pritula\" for the needs of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. It is reported that thanks to the data received from him, more than 60 units of military equipment, which was disguised in the forest belts of Kherson and Nikolaev regions, were destroyed. The cost of destroyed equipment already exceeds the cost of the satellite.\n\nThe New York Times has released an investigation into recordings of wiretapping calls from soldiers from the Kiev region. During these calls, Russian soldiers admit that the commanders ordered them to kill civilians, citing the fact that the latter can transmit the coordinates of the positions of Russian forces to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian law enforcement agencies accused Rosgvardia employees from the Kemerovo region and Krasnoyarsk Krai of shooting cars of civilians in Gostomel, Kiev region on February 25. Failing to complete the combat mission to capture Kiev, the Russian Guards retreated and took positions in Gostomel, where they shot cars with local residents who tried to evacuate for more than six hours.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine declared Lieutenant General Andrei Mordvichev responsible for the capture of Mariupol and the storming of Azovstal.\n\nResidents of Izyum, whose houses cannot be prepared for the heating season, are offered to evacuate for the winter to other settlements of Kharkiv, Poltava or other regions.",

                "body": "I think you're overestimating American gains from the Pelosi visit and the Russia-Ukraine war. Let me say this as a baseline, I think the American public is much more supportive of Ukraine during a Russian invasion of the country, than they would be of Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion of the country, I think that because Russia and the US have a long history of being enemies in the modern era, for older people that's due to the Soviet Union, for younger people it's due to Putin's notorious authoritarianism along with several wars and interventions taking place during his time as president. \n\nUkraine itself is also clearly a sovereign, white, Christian, European country, one that has enjoyed decades of independence, with strong legitimacy and well defined borders that were clearly violated by an aggressor who didn't have good relations with the US to begin with. Biden also very clearly went out of his way to let people know that the US won't be sending troops which is fine, equipment and other forms of assisstance are clearly enough for Ukraine to succeed.\n\nNone of this can be said for Taiwan, the US has generally been neutral or friendly with China and this has only really changed in the past 7 years or so, with Xi Jinping himself only being in office for 10 years, that's peanuts compared to over half a century of bad blood between Russians and Americans and I don't think US media is doing enough to sell the public on the idea of the Chinese being the new Communists, Nazis or whatever that would make them a popular enemy figure, there's just too little history to work with and the public generally doesn't have nearly as much interest and emotional investment in Asia as it has in Europe (the Russian invasion of Ukraine being a European conflict is also another thing that heavily favours Ukraine). \n\nTaiwan and Ukraine are also night and day as countries, while Taiwan managed to shed it's dictatorial roots, they're still a rather young democracy that's been stuck in a civil war that never ended and has enjoyed little to no real legitimacy worldwide despite their de facto independence. And most importantly, despite everything making it seem like supporting Taiwan would be harder to sell to the American public than supporting Ukraine, the political leadership of the US has to make not just the idea of supporting Taiwan, but make the idea of directly intervening in Taiwan, basically de facto going to war with China, popular with the public, along with convincing both Japan and Korea to risk their skin one way or another. Note that despite the immense popular support for Ukraine the idea of a direct intervention in Ukraine (despite it being significantly more popular than intervening in Taiwan by my estimates) is still very [unpopular](https://www.reuters.com/world/just-over-half-americans-say-us-should-back-ukraine-until-russia-withdraws-2022-08-24/).\n\nMaybe I'm underestimating the power of US media, misunderstanding the general mentality of the American public, ignoring the somewhat likely scenario of China striking American bases which would be Pearl Harbour esque rallying moment, completely misreading the conflict by thinking that direct US intervention is even necessary and so on, but I think American leadership still has a very long way to go when it comes to making the idea of going to war with China for Taiwan's sake acceptable for the American, Japanese and Korean people despite it being a basic requirement for a successful defense of Taiwan.",

Let me say this as a baseline, I think the American public is much more supportive of Ukraine during a Russian invasion of the country, than they would be of Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion of the country, I think that because Russia and the US have a long history of being enemies in the modern era, for older people that&#39;s due to the Soviet Union, for younger people it&#39;s due to Putin&#39;s notorious authoritarianism along with several wars and interventions taking place during his time as president. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine itself is also clearly a sovereign, white, Christian, European country, one that has enjoyed decades of independence, with strong legitimacy and well defined borders that were clearly violated by an aggressor who didn&#39;t have good relations with the US to begin with.

He was bigly wrong on Iraq but I believe right about Putin around Crimea 2014 (essentially he felt Putin would freak out when he realized he had no real buffers against the West, no vassal state) and a never-Trumper so some points back in his column. Not sure I trust him implicitly, but he's worth listening to.\n\nSo, on Putin being ousted/killed/couped. Originally, I was hopeful this would happen, but I quickly reverted to the standard line of most everyone, that the oligarchs would never move against Putin. Indeed, while initially Russian government reaction to the war seemed quite bad (a lot of moaning and upset people), it relatively quickly turned to a rallying moment when Western sanctions started to hit. A lot of \"Oh so you're sanction us? Well go f\\*\\*k yourself West, we'll show you how Russia really is.\" sort of things. At least that's what people with connection to government officials and sources were saying. That effect seemed to last quite a while, but now? I feel quite strongly that the situation has changed and it's not wishful thinking, it's evidence based. We have to start taking the potential for a coup or assassination seriously.\n\nWhy? Well first, those same kind of sources from early in the war, the ones who have contacts in the government, are now saying that the government is in shambles. Officials are in a state of despair, they're drinking heavily, they're certain Putin is going to use a nuclear weapon, certain that Russia is being led to its doom. It sounds like the sentiments at the start of the war but a 100x worse. This time there will be no rallying effect. Moving on from that, opinion polls in Russia are starting to look concerning for Putin. Yes, we can't trust them, but usually the bias is for the regime, not against it. Now, both state-run polling and the Levada Center polling are starting to converge. The majority of Russian people are freaked out about the conflict. A much smaller percentage, maybe a quarter feel proud. And even then, most people see the conflict as only sort of successful (probably a result of annexation) as opposed to a tiny percentage (less than 10) that see it as a completely successful endeavor. This is not good. I'm not implying a revolution is going to sweep the nation, but threats to the integrity of the system are threats to the oligarchs, and they don't want to be threatened. For now, Putin is deflecting blame. But when these conscripts start dying in waves (which they will), what's going to happen? Third, the nuclear threats are cutting both ways. People in Russia are no more willing to get turned into nuclear ash than Westerners. The country is not a death cult. They have a culture of martyrdom and suffering, yes, but they are not suicide bombers. Putin's consistent nuclear rhetoric is scaring people in his own country too. This includes oligarchs and elites. They have had a good gig going for a while now. Toe the line, make a shit ton of money, let Putin do his thing. But Putin's thing is now putting all of their earnings (and their lives) at risk. We have to remember that, yes, some of these powerful figures may be patriots. They may believe in a powerful Russia. But they are also greedy, self-preserving gangsters. This is not speculation, btw, these are just the kind of people at the top of the Russian powers structure. Those are the kind of people that get ahead in Putin's Russia, often by design. And even if they are true patriots, the Russia that is currently bleeding to death on the oblasts of Ukraine while simultaneously pissing off its should-be vassals and friends abroad is hardly the great Russia Putin is promising. This is not a world-leading country and they know that. I can only hope that all but the craziest among them realize that Russia can't fire off some tactical nukes and suddenly become a leader of the new world order. Finally, there's Putin himself. He's sidelined his high command due to a lack of trust, he's taking part in operation level planning and responding to those commanders over the concerns of his top advisors, he's springing massive, country-shaping decisions on the government with little to no warning. He's appearing angry and rambling publicly. He's old and it shows. He's rarely looked this weak. His isolation and paranoia are not helping him build confidence as a leader. He is trying to shift his entire society from a carefully cultivated stance of \"non-involvement\" to an intense \"everyone all in for Russia\" posture. That's hard to do. All the while, while looking at his weakest, while leading Russians to the slaughter in \\*his\\* war, he is also pushing a near deification narrative. \"Russia's destiny is my destiny. When Russia hurts I hurt\". It'd be a hard sell to imagine that didn't get a few side-eyes in the audience. After all, these dudes signed up for money and power and prestige, not to join their \"messiah\" on the bonfire. After all, is Putin as he is now someone people would want to follow to the grave? Even Kadyrov is getting finnicky about mobilizing more men. Is it such a stretch to assume that people are beginning to think Putin's lost his touch?\n\nFinal conclusion of all that: *I think a coup or assassination is growing more likely by the day.* In fact, I insist that if we take the idea of nuclear weapons use increasing as the conflict continues, we have to do the same with the idea of a violent removal of Putin at an even more accelerated rate. I do not think this is the likely outcome of the war by any means. But I think we have no choice but to consider it seriously at this point. Of course, I have read all the counterarguments. This is wishful thinking. The person who replaces Putin could be worse. We have no idea how the Kremlin operates. These are complaints from mid-level functionaries being broadcast. I don't necessarily disagree. Well, I do disagree with the idea that the person replacing Putin is guaranteed to be worse. If Putin is replaced, he may very well have a successor that's worse in 10-20 years. Maybe. But right now? With Putin threatening nuclear war every five minutes, apparently ready to take us all face first into the escalation vortex that ends in the death of civilization? No, I cannot imagine his successor would immediately assume the same posture. Continue the war, maybe. But not in the same way or manner as Putin, it simply doesn't make sense. If anything, I think this war has discredited the hawkish siloviki to a certain extent. They got what they wanted, it's a mess, well maybe they don't know what's best. I digress. I acknowledge the counterarguments but I don't think they put a coup in the realm of fairyland any more.\n\nAs a final note, I will add this. I think this issue is in a similar realm to how difficult it was for analysts to accept the idea that Russia could lose (and is losing) this war. For so long now, Russia has been viewed as the number two military in the world. The eternal bogeyman of the West. The great Russian bear. They'll be through half of Poland in two weeks. So long had we spent focusing on them in that role, we never really allowed ourselves the chance to think they would get beat because it was unthinkable. Yet here we are. Putin is the same way. For my entire life and probably many of the other posters here too, Putin has been the big, bad tough man of Russia. Calculating, in control, answerable to no one but God. But that construct has been broken. That's what it was, a construct. Putin is clearly fallible, probably a lot more fallible than some people. The God-King bleeds, you get the idea. Are we still too wrapped up in the notion of Putin the mastermind, Putin the great dictator, to acknowledge just how precarious Putin's position has become? Are our preconceived understandings of him clouding our judgment? I think it's a serious question worth considering.",

However, you will have islands that are fortified echo chambers that arent going anywhere (flat earth?) </p>\n\n<p>In controlled press you will have a bunch of narratibes as well, but there is no boiling down to the truth factor as there is no real confirmation bias. Also no matter how much different scenarios the bureuo of media control spits out, they just cannot produce the same &quot;weight class&quot; as millions of people free balling there theories into, well , random fake news, opinion articles etc. They are just to many to contend with. While in a free-press world, usually democratic values enable the voices of people to share these opinions the same thing cannot be said about centrally controled medias, where people have no real option to get their voices heard</p>\n</div>",

Hopefully this will change with new rearmament policies across the continent.

                    "body": "***Pick your poison.***\n\n***Six of one, half a dozen of another.***\n\n***Mobility, Firepower, Protection. Pick one and a half. That's what it all comes down to.***\n\nThat's a bit flippant, and I need to specify. Either vehicle is effective, any vehicle is effective.  I'm going to lean more on Strykers, for a few reasons. \n\n**First Problem.** One big rule is, you don't mix wheeled vehicles and tracked vehicles.  So if you go Bradley, you need M113s / FV432s  etc for the other hundreds of armored vehicles in a Battalion/Brigade. \n\n**Next problem,** there is no Dozer/Engineer section carrier for the Bradley, nor a Mortar Carrier, Command Post, Recovery variants/Mobile repair teams, Forward Observation Post, Ambulance nor a TOW carrier\\* (Big caviat, I know that TOW is default on all vehicles, however a separate TOW only variant, that allows for Faster  and under cover reloads is useful for your Battalion/Brigade/Division anti armour plan, which needs dedicated assets.). At that point, you need M113s/FV432s/ etc. **Only 60 of your 100** or so \"A\" vehicles in a Battalion are Infantry Section Carriers. The rest are specialized variants. Those other 40 vehicles do matter.\n\n**Third problem**, tracked vehicles need more maintenance, which adds cost, weight and complexity.  Less fuel consumption too, which means slightly less of a logistics tail. Oh, and you don't need to load them on a railcar or tank transporter to redeploy them.\n\n**Fourth problem,** crew capacity. You can fit 10 in a Stryker, 7 in a Bradley (8 dismounts). Personally, I love the idea of a larger rifle section, that way you can leave 2 with the vehicle and have 10 dismounts, which lets you push GPMG and Carl Gustav/Javelin/Milan/Eryx/Spike down to the section level, while not impacting your normal 2 Rifle/1 LMG / 1 Rifle grenade groups. (Ideally you'd go to a 4 Rifle /2 Rifle-grenade assault and a 2 LMG /1 GPMG/1 Rifle (Section 2ic for fire control) Gun group, but that's me, and I don't do well on section attacks then.).\n\nInfantry is something you really need a -lot- of for close combat, especially in urban/built up areas, or in the defensive if you're running at 25/50% manning of a defensive position. You can never have too many dismounts, nor too many field engineers.\n\n**Next problem**. Bradley's are too big and cumbersome for Internal security, Riot control, Line of communication protection, Aide to civil power, Vital point security duties. Duties I think, myself are core to the Infantry's mission. I'm not an American, I never had Posse Comitatus as a limitation.  How many shields can you fit, how many to set up a riot line or cordon? You need a lot of troops to do that.\n\nNow, armament. 50 cal vs 25mm. Huge difference yes, your Strykers are going into a Zulu harbour same as a M113/FV432 would, you're not going to get to dismount on the objective.  (Please note the LAVIII has 25mm, and the new Stryker dragoon has 30mm). If you need the 25mm/30mm as direct fire support ***with*** your dismounts, you're doing something wrong. You shouldn't be assaulting without either over watch/firebases, or the ability to call in indirect and other direct fire assets. **One foot on the ground at all times.**  This isn't DP 1.2 or IOBC or the PCBC where one platoon does a magic attack, or the Platoon Offensive ex where it notational happens. In reality, no-one should be attacking alone. This isn't Iraq or Afghanistan.....\n\nIn the defensive, if you need the TOW at the section level on your position, or the 25/30mm, again, you're in it deep at that point and have poorly prepared your position. Again, you never dig a platoon in alone, without them being integrated into the larger fire plan. The Forward Observation Officer owns the General Purpose Machine guns for a reason. \n\nYou are not going to want to go into battle with a doctrinal SBCT against a Motor Rifle or Motor Tank Regiment, you'll need an Armoured regiment to bulk your forces out. However for the Infantry Battalion, in what they are fighting, I have to lean on the Stryker series as the more useful variant.",

Huge difference yes, your Strykers are going into a Zulu harbour same as a M113/FV432 would, you&#39;re not going to get to dismount on the objective.  (Please note the LAVIII has 25mm, and the new Stryker dragoon has 30mm). If you need the 25mm/30mm as direct fire support <strong><em>with</em></strong> your dismounts, you&#39;re doing something wrong. You shouldn&#39;t be assaulting without either over watch/firebases, or the ability to call in indirect and other direct fire assets. <strong>One foot on the ground at all times.</strong>  This isn&#39;t DP 1.2 or IOBC or the PCBC where one platoon does a magic attack, or the Platoon Offensive ex where it notational happens. In reality, no-one should be attacking alone. This isn&#39;t Iraq or Afghanistan.....</p>\n\n<p>In the defensive, if you need the TOW at the section level on your position, or the 25/30mm, again, you&#39;re in it deep at that point and have poorly prepared your position. Again, you never dig a platoon in alone, without them being integrated into the larger fire plan. The Forward Observation Officer owns the General Purpose Machine guns for a reason. </p>\n\n<p>You are not going to want to go into battle with a doctrinal SBCT against a Motor Rifle or Motor Tank Regiment, you&#39;ll need an Armoured regiment to bulk your forces out. However for the Infantry Battalion, in what they are fighting, I have to lean on the Stryker series as the more useful variant.</p>\n</div>",

Charter to expel Russia is not, in fact or law, prevented by Russia\u2019s status as a permanent member of the Security Council. Whether Putin and his agents in the government and military on the ground in Ukraine ought to be prosecuted as war criminals, or even whether Russia should be expelled from the U.N. for directly endangering international peace by waging an unlawful war of aggression against the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighbor and its noncombatant citizens, are deeply complicated geopolitical questions for which this post admittedly offers no hint of an answer. Instead, there is some reason to be optimistic, rather than cynical, about the global community\u2019s legal right to hold even a Security Council permanent member accountable for its illegality by removing that offender from the community itself, as both a deterrent and an expressive signal of how much the global communities values the principles of the U.N. project. I suspect that this view does not appeal to the governments of any of the other four permanent members.

That such action has never occurred in the U.N.\u2019s history does not render the individual U.N. Charter\u2019s meaning and purpose irrelevant, though. The charter is understood to be a \u201cconstitutional framework\u201d that structures the rights and responsibilities of the member states. Just as one would interpret the U.S. Constitution in the absence of binding precedent, the charter\u2019s rules, including rules creating the rights and responsibilities of the Security Council, ought to be read in a way consistent with the charter\u2019s purpose and design. Article 6, demonstrated by its text and by its relation to other articles, does provide for the very kind of accountability that intuition demands but that conventional wisdom has, so far, prematurely deemed procedurally impossible.\n\ntl;dr \n\nThere is no precedent or explicit provision, but the *spirit* of the charter which can be interpreted and used to argue its provisions allows for the removal of anyone who is a persistent offender. \n\nMy notes:\n\nThis is something like the Nuremberg trials : it\u2019s difficult to define jurisdiction and prosecution at this international level for which no mechanism exists. It\u2019ll be argued for long, and even after the verdict is delivered, throughout human history.

Article 6, demonstrated by its text and by its relation to other articles, does provide for the very kind of accountability that intuition demands but that conventional wisdom has, so far, prematurely deemed procedurally impossible.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr </p>\n\n<p>There is no precedent or explicit provision, but the <em>spirit</em> of the charter which can be interpreted and used to argue its provisions allows for the removal of anyone who is a persistent offender. </p>\n\n<p>My notes:</p>\n\n<p>This is something like the Nuremberg trials : it\u2019s difficult to define jurisdiction and prosecution at this international level for which no mechanism exists. It\u2019ll be argued for long, and even after the verdict is delivered, throughout human history. But law derives from intention and spirit, and those cannot be repeatedly broken without repercussions.</p>\n</div>",

Whats worse is that often in these kinds of stories much of the accounts despite being reported are still around, since presumably the moderators are so overworked that they dont have time to even look at anything that requires explanation of what is going on. There is no reason that places like Twitter could not conduct these kinds of investigations in house and shut down these networks. \n\nHowever twitters business model relies on not spending a lot on moderation, and the effects spill over on society. Its exactly the same as polluting factory simply saying \"sorry it costs too much not to pollute so its just going to have to be cancer for everyone\".

It just takes investment to get the kind of numbers that would be effective for that size.</p>\n\n<p>Its far less complex than it seems and a lot of the organised botting is done pretty transparently (and lazily) to the point that one or a few dedicated individuals (usually investigative reporters or OSINT types) with only a few days / weeks of investigations have uncovered the network. Whats worse is that often in these kinds of stories much of the accounts despite being reported are still around, since presumably the moderators are so overworked that they dont have time to even look at anything that requires explanation of what is going on. There is no reason that places like Twitter could not conduct these kinds of investigations in house and shut down these networks. </p>\n\n<p>However twitters business model relies on not spending a lot on moderation, and the effects spill over on society. Its exactly the same as polluting factory simply saying &quot;sorry it costs too much not to pollute so its just going to have to be cancer for everyone&quot;.

If one of the other mods would like me to move it please let me know.\n\nSo I was rereading Putin's speech transcript and I'm curious about something. Everyone I've seen is interpreting Putin's point about Hiroshima and Nagasaki as \"being a precedent\" as an implicit nuclear threat. But what if it's not? Here's the relevant passage.\n\n>Western countries have been saying for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead of bringing democracy they suppressed and exploited, and instead of giving freedom they enslaved and oppressed. The unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and unfree; it is false and hypocritical through and through.  \n>  \n>The United States is the only country in the world that has used nuclear weapons twice, destroying the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. And they created a precedent.  \n>  \n>Recall that during WWII the United States and Britain reduced Dresden, Hamburg, Cologne and many other German cities to rubble, without the least military necessity. It was done ostentatiously and, to repeat, without any military necessity. They had only one goal, as with the nuclear bombing of Japanese cities: to intimidate our country and the rest of the world.  \n>  \n>The United States left a deep scar in the memory of the people of Korea and Vietnam with their carpet bombings and use of napalm and chemical weapons.\n\nThis is obviously a litany of horrible things the West has done historically. What if the precedent referred to here is not the precedent for atomic use, but rather the precedent of the West (more specifically the Anglo-Saxons) committing terrible crimes against innocent people. The way the line is built into the context really doesn't make it seem like a threat, so much as, \"They showed how evil they are by being the only people to use nuclear weapons. They set the precedent of intimidation and killing of civilians.\" The follow-on to this line is a discussion of bombing Dresden etc and the atomic bombings all to intimidate both Russia and the rest of the world, then he carries on with Vietnam and Korea. I think that's the precedent he's referring to, which would be in line with Putin and Russia in general referring to those bombings as war crimes and the idea that the West, not Russia, is the real nuclear bully here.\n\nEither a completely misinterpreted statement (since we're all a bit ready to hear nuke threats at this time, we just assume the worst because that is the norm) or a subtle little turn of phrase meant to cause some panic without being obvious. Just a textual reading, maybe in the original Russian it was more clear, but I don't think we need to immediately succumb to the idea Putin is threatening nukes in every line.

            "body": "You shouldn't be too concerned about the spread of far-right views in Ukraine in my opinion. Ukraine has already showed itself capable of containing far-right influence, and Ukrainian public in general also shows very little interest in going to extremes.\n\nIn 2014 there were similar fears, with the \"Right Sector\" far-right group gaining fairly big prominence, and with all the volunteer militias spreading around the country. However look at them now - Right Sector essentially does not exist. Even in the first post-revolutionary elections they gained pretty much no seats whatsoever, and have been on decline ever since. Now, during war, they are pretty much non-existent still. All the militias were incorporated into National Guard units and cleansed of the worst offenders, or those left by themselves as military personnel can't take part in political parties.

Now, during war, they are pretty much non-existent still.
