        "body": "There are some positive news today: in the Bakhmut sector the Ukrainians have reportedly captured the last heights right to the west of Klishchiivka and are making significant progress towards Andriivka, a couple of kilometers further south (note that the Ukrainians fear a Russian counterattack in this area); in the Svatove sector the \"bridgehead\" (I would really not use this term for anything regarding the Zherebets River - in the course near Svatove the river is half a meter deep and 10 meters wide) has stabilized, the advance should be about 4 kilometers. Russian rumors of yesterday's evening about a second breakthrough from the villages of Raihorodka/Dzherelne a little further north have not been confirmed.\n\nI would like to share news I read today from Ukrainian sources (Konstantin Mashovets and the Centre for Defense Strategies) on the southern front. The Velyka Novosilka sector is considered the most promising one and the one where the Russians had to commit the highest number of reserves. Between Staromaiorske and Pryyutne, the Russians are reportedly beginning to employ elements of the \"second reserve batch\" (336th Naval Infantry Brigade and 136th Motorized Brigade), after having sent the 34th Mountain Brigade and the 247th VDV Regiment a couple of weeks ago to assist the units that had been present in that sector since June. Russian counterattacks in that area have been unsuccessful, major fighting has been under way. It's said that the 37th Motorized Brigade is having serious difficulties in Novodonetske, a little further east. The Center for Defense Strategies seems to be sure that by the end of July the Russians will have to withdraw to the Remivka - Volodyne - Staromlynivka - Kermenchyk line. This is an important statement, we will see if it will be confirmed or not, personally it seems optimistic to me. However, this alternative is considered more likely than the introduction of Russian reserves around Novodonetske.\n\nIn the Kamyanske sector elements of the UAF 128th Mountain Brigade managed to advance in Kamyanske on the road to Vasylivka, forcing the Russians to swiftly send two BARS detachments into the area and deploy elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade nearby. The advances in this sector are reported to be slow and \"well-thought.\" In the Orikhiv sector the Ukrainians reportedly captured several heights just northeast of Robotyne from which there is a good view of the surrounding territory. Net of Ukrainian attacks, Russian counterattacks, and new Ukrainian advances occurring with regularity in the area, the Ukrainians seem to have really come close to the village, although we all know at what cost; this is by far the most complicated sector. Around Novopokrovka, the Ukrainians are reported to be carrying out attacks at what should be the boundary between the areas under the responsibility of the Southern Military District and the Eastern one, hoping to achieve results from a potential lack of coordination. Although they may not necessarily succeed - Velyka Novosilka is already a mixture of units from these two MDs after all.\n\nRussian operational reserves across the southern front are increasingly under stress every week and those that can be deployed very quickly are reported to be very few; Mashovets suggests that there is a possibility that the Ukrainians could open up a fourth direction of attack, without making direct hints. This could be an Ukrainian strategy to take advantage of their numerical superiority in the South and pressure Russian reserves even more, which could be forced to send the last remaining formations along the Dnipro in Kherson Oblast. What might this new direction be? In my opinion: a direct attack on Polohy, which, however, the Russians seem to expect, having sent most of the elements of the 35th Army around the town in June; Marfopil, where I recall an Ukrainian attack happened back in June (the Russians have reported Ukrainian reconnaissance actions in this area in the last weeks, which along with Polohy is the quietest in the South); an attack from Vuhledar, which should have the least developed defenses in the South and with a smallish number of Russians defending it, although it's also the area closest to Russia proper and therefore with fewer potential logistical difficulties for them.

Kharkiv was clearly a wakeup call, as they left poorly equipped, highly attrited, low morale units holding a wide frontage without digging in or properly deploying minefields, and they suffered a major defeat as a result. \n\nTo address these shortcomings, Russia has taken a number of concrete steps that appear highly effective. There's been a heavy focus on Russia's inheritance of deep stockpiles of armored vehicles, artillery, and ammunition from the Soviet Union, and rightfully so, but they also inherited a nearly \"inexhaustible\" stockpile of AT and AP mines as well that they're now using to great effect. We've also seen evidence of Russian forces luring Ukrainian attackers into pre-mined trenches, that they then blow up once the Ukrainians have occupied them. This is likely a highly effective tactic considering Ukraine is increasingly using infantry assaults to get around minefields, and infantry are desperate for any semblance of cover on the open terrain of the Southern front. \n\nMobilization has obviously also allowed Russia to reinforce heavily attrited units, as well as build brand new formations that increase the density of Russian forces at front. Russia's extensive use of well-sited, effective fortifications is also widely known. \n\nIn my opinion, one of the most interesting adaptations Kofman and co noted was Russia's intermixing of high quality and low quality units along the Southern front. This actually helps address the weaknesses of both, with Storm Z and mobiks providing mass to \"elite\" formations and Spetsnaz, while soaking up Ukrainian fire on their behalf. Simultaneously the HQ formations provide capabilities the LQ units lack like nightfighting, direct lines of communication with fire support/Russian air force, integrated ATGMs and kamikaze drones (these are being used to savage Ukrainian formations as seen by recent videos near Robotyne), and better communication with command. Integrating Russian elite forces into their low quality units gives them much more cohesion, firepower, and reduces the likelihood of them routing, all of which were problems on the Kharkiv axis. \n\nTaken altogether, Russian forces have vastly improved their defensive capabilities, addressing some of the biggest issues Ukraine was able to exploit during previous offensives. As such, any future Ukrainian advances are likely to be costly, slow, and fitful, unless something dramatically changes. \n\nIf Russia plays their cards right, which it seems like they are, they're going to be able to build a defensive position Ukraine won't be able to dislodge them from.

Ukraine has powerful, but potentially fickle backers. Attrition could benefit them medium to longterm, or it could lead to their backers forcing them into a settlement.

Ukraine benefitted from Russia being on the offensive most of the war, and exacted a high price from them while on the defensive. At this point however, Russian offensive potential is practically exhausted. So they're likely to become more defensive over time, and as I noted theyve made drastic improvements to their defenses. If Ukraine needs to be the one primarily on offense in order to drive the Russians out of the occupied parts of the country, Ukraine's casualty ratios will suffer.

            "body": "I think that may be overstating things. The Russians had well over a year to lay down enormous quantities of mines and fortifications, which was a process carried out by material technical brigades rather than combat troops. So it's not as if anyone displayed any great ingenuity or even competence here, and if they did, it wasn't the combat formations. It's easy to dig trenches and lay down minefields when no one is shooting at you, and in classic Russian form they chose to go for quantity in a big way when it comes to the mines.\n\nThe very best troops the Russians have to offer defended Kherson and were still eventually pushed out because of the Ukrainian interdiction campaign. Although they might not have a river at their back now, the battlefield geometry still places large sections of the Russian positions in the south in danger of falling to a similar slow strangle, because the narrow GLOCs over the neck of the Crimean peninsula function exactly like the Antonovsky Bridge did in Kherson: a choke point subject to frequent Ukrainian interdiction which is not sufficient to establish full fire control but is sufficient to cause the Russians many headaches. Similarly, the GLOCs in from Rostov are within relatively short range of Ukrainian positions and so even small progress toward the south dramatically increases the Ukrainian ability to interdict the one remaining railroad that can bring heavy supplies in from Rostov.\n\nAlso, the Ukrainians have more long range precision fires capabilities to balance out the relatively larger ranges in play now and are increasingly attacking targets deep into Crimea. The Russians, meanwhile, are suffering intense shell shortages for the first time in the war. Their most effective combat formation has been the 58th CAA, which isn't an elite formation at all but simply the one that has suffered the least attrition over the last 18 months. That will not last for long because they lack sufficient reserves to rotate units off the lines, which will very quickly exhaust their remaining combat power. The VDV may have been able to hang on with extraordinary tenacity in Kherson, but I doubt you will see similarly high performance from the 58th CAA if the battlefield in Zaporizhzhia becomes more dynamic and requires them to adapt to changing circumstances even a little.\n\nIt is an absolutely horrendous sign for the Russians that the general in command of that unit resigned (or was fired for speaking out, so effectively a resignation). Generals resigning in protest because their troops don't have sufficient ammo is historically not a positive omen for a military at war. Nor are officer purges like those that followed Popov's resignation generally a feature of a well-functioning military. Nor is armed rebellion against the leader of a country at war.\n\nThis is probably the fifth or sixth period of relatively less visible Ukrainian successes where everyone has decided to freak out and start declaring the war a stalemate or Ukrainian loss. But let's put things in perspective here. It's been *seven whole weeks* since the Ukrainians started their counteroffensive. That's *nothing*. Seven weeks into the full invasion, the Russians had just barely had enough time to retreat from Kyiv in shame. It takes time to develop and test new tactics, especially when working with unfamiliar or novel equipment and even more especially when trying to disseminate those lessons learned across a large, diverse, and relatively new organization. That's doubly true if the Ukrainians are prioritizing force preservation and are thus proceeding with caution and an eye toward minimizing the risk of unsustainable personnel or materiel losses, as they seem to be doing. Which is also why there isn't any rush to declare stalemate: the Ukrainians are nowhere near having expended all the resources they saved up for the offensive, and they seem to be taking a slower, more methodical approach. The Russians can Leeroy Jenkins themselves into extinction but that doesn't mean the Ukrainians need to follow suit.\n\nSo yes, the counteroffensive hasn't turned out to be the cakewalk some expected it to be. But that has more to do with people's overly optimistic sense of the timelines wars happen on. Things are often a grinding stalemate until suddenly one day they aren't. Attrition enables maneuver, as the saying goes, and we are seeing the last remaining intact large scale Russian combat formation suffering the brunt of the attrition now. What maneuvers will that enable, I wonder?\n\nAnd, yes, the Russians have benefited from being able to lay down mind numbingly large numbers of mines in relative peace during the 16 months of relative quiet on the Zaporizhzhia front. But mines are static and can't be easily replaced while under active Ukrainian interdiction. I'm sure the Ukrainians are working very hard to figure out a way to deal with them right now, and they've figured harder things out before.\n\nAnd, yes, the Russians have not made precisely the same mistakes in Zaporizhzhia as they did in Kharkiv. They learned a few lessons, but it took them an incredibly long time to do so, and in the meantime they've sacked the general responsible for putting those lessons into practice in the first place. Just as the Ukrainians have begun to learn their own lessons in turn, potentially eroding the advantages of Popov's work to stabilize the 58th CAA.\n\nEnemies learning is an essential feature of war. That means tactics will generally become less effective over time as your enemies adapt to your tactics, forcing you to adapt in turn. War is a constant seesaw back and forth as each side attempts to eke out whatever little edge they can manage, with each gaining the upper hand over the other at times. What matters is who can learn and innovate more quickly to maintain a tactical edge over the other side, thus keeping the initiative and ensuring they suffer less than their enemy.\n\nWhich army do you think has displayed the greater capacity for learning and rapid adaptation? Is it even close? I would say not at all. Which is why the Ukrainians only tried a couple of overly aggressive armored breaching assaults before they realized the head on approach wasn't working, likely primarily because of the lack of air superiority, although their own inexperience operating in large scale units and with the specific western equipment they have is also likely a factor. Rather than waste their limited supplies of armor and their invaluable soldiers' lives so frivolously, they took an operational pause a couple weeks ago to try to figure out a different path forward. Contrast that approach with the Russians, who burned through hundreds of vehicles and thousands of soldiers lives on dozens of repeated failed attacks around Vuhledar and Kreminna where they attempted few if any adjustments on their failed assaults, instead slamming their heads repeatedly against a Ukrainian wall of mines and artillery. And all those casualties never survived to become experienced veterans. The Ukrainians are surviving, even with their failed assaults, because western armor is so much more survivable than Russian. Which means they are learning. So I would suggest giving them time to do so before you give up on them completely. At least until the mud season.",

Which is why the Ukrainians only tried a couple of overly aggressive armored breaching assaults before they realized the head on approach wasn&#39;t working, likely primarily because of the lack of air superiority, although their own inexperience operating in large scale units and with the specific western equipment they have is also likely a factor. Rather than waste their limited supplies of armor and their invaluable soldiers&#39; lives so frivolously, they took an operational pause a couple weeks ago to try to figure out a different path forward. Contrast that approach with the Russians, who burned through hundreds of vehicles and thousands of soldiers lives on dozens of repeated failed attacks around Vuhledar and Kreminna where they attempted few if any adjustments on their failed assaults, instead slamming their heads repeatedly against a Ukrainian wall of mines and artillery. And all those casualties never survived to become experienced veterans. The Ukrainians are surviving, even with their failed assaults, because western armor is so much more survivable than Russian. Which means they are learning. So I would suggest giving them time to do so before you give up on them completely. At least until the mud season.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "I think some credible options for a response to an accidental, but consequential direct hit within NATO territory would include:\n\n* Deploying further AA and air assets in Eastern Flank countries in order to enable better and faster response in case of other accidents. The point to make would be that reckless attacks will consistently degrade Russia's strategic position. The aim would be to make the traditional Soviet policy of opportunistic moves harder and riskier to pursue by making even small gains costly in the long run.\n* Tightening pressure in international forums, like the UN. Point out that, in the interest of world peace, NATO will not respond militarily for now, but make it clear that, if Russia does not revise its target selection policy to match its targeting abilities, it will intervene to protect its citizens. The highly-hierarchical Russian army has a very political and centralized target selection process; a carefully-delivered threat can further drive a wedge between the professional army cadres and the highly political military leadership above it. This would also make positions based on \"being on the side of peace\" harder to drive through, as siding with the side that's *challenging* gobal peace by not lookin' where they're shootin' against the side that just let a fatal incident slide in the interest of avoiding World War III would look bad on TV even on Channel One.\n* If the hit involves the use of equipment with foreign components, NATO countries can tighten sanctions against their countries of origin (if they're non-NATO countries) or pursue costly image or even legal campaigns against NATO-based suppliers. The point to make is that supplying a foreign government that may attack NATO territory even by mistake is not something that will remain without consequences. The aim would be to make collaboration between Russia and its suppliers a little bumpier, something that Western countries have, so far, largely abstained from (and which I think they should re-examine anyway, considering that we're now more than a year and a half into the war).\n\nNone of these would be decisive, but that's a given at this level.\n\nEdit: inb4 \"these are all very weak responses\", I'm adjusting this for what I think NATO *could* do under current conditions (i.e. if this were to happen, like, tomorrow) while pressed to achieve a consensus in a very short timeframe. I do think such an incident should trigger a much more serious response but, realistically, I don't think a sharper response could be implemented in a short enough timeframe to be considered adequate or make an impact, for several reasons, not the least because a heavier response carries additional risks of escalation, which would inevitably bring into question the matter of collective action, and the Russian government currently enjoys a veto by proxy via Hungary whenever that question pops up. A more realistic course of action would be for NATO to use such an incident as a basis to start developing a framework for more heavy-handed response to *further* incidents of a similar nature, as that would allow a lot more time to extract concessions.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think some credible options for a response to an accidental, but consequential direct hit within NATO territory would include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deploying further AA and air assets in Eastern Flank countries in order to enable better and faster response in case of other accidents. The point to make would be that reckless attacks will consistently degrade Russia&#39;s strategic position. The aim would be to make the traditional Soviet policy of opportunistic moves harder and riskier to pursue by making even small gains costly in the long run.</li>\n<li>Tightening pressure in international forums, like the UN. Point out that, in the interest of world peace, NATO will not respond militarily for now, but make it clear that, if Russia does not revise its target selection policy to match its targeting abilities, it will intervene to protect its citizens. The highly-hierarchical Russian army has a very political and centralized target selection process; a carefully-delivered threat can further drive a wedge between the professional army cadres and the highly political military leadership above it.

Ever since 2022 Congress members have basically said that the Biden Administration needs to provide more equipment faster. The reason this is mostly just noise is because Congress could always pass a bill *directing* the Biden Administration to provide more equipment or provide it faster. \n\nThe issue is, of course, the Biden Administration would simply say show me the money. Current supplementals seem like a lot of money until you start getting into large numbers of vehicles, parts, maintenance, ammunition, and training. A torrent of equipment - if even possible to provide - would drain these rather funds quickly, and having to come back for more or leave the US's own stocks depleted. \n\nCongress could - even over Biden Administration and DoD objections - provide the money and direction to expand production of Abrams, Bradleys, AMPVs, Strykers, and ammunition even before purchasing replacements for F-16s that might get donated. It could also direct the State Department to figure out deals for training/lending equipment to get every piece of Soviet stock left in NATO/allied countries including possibly overpaying. It could also direct the State Department to work with Ukraine to secure contracts from NATO/allied countries for equipment they need, and pay for it. \n\nThe reason I say it's noise is because while they are half doing the first point above (and maybe the other two in small amounts), there's no way a Congress member is going to stand up and say that tens of billions of US defense money should go to foreign companies. They'd get torn apart by critics even if they thought it was a good idea. That's before the ideological bents even come into play: Democratic Congress members would want that money for their priorities, and Republican Congress members would either want it spent in the US or not at all. \n\nSo where we are is where we have been. Congress wants to spend money for Ukraine, but almost exclusively to companies inside the US. It also will defer to the DoD on whether any potential drawdown is too much and would hurt US readiness. Congress members will make a lot of noise depending on what they believe will score them votes but not any real action. \n\nThe one new and added wrinkle is that the Republican House Majority is only 5 members. A portion of those want no more aid, a portion wants only security aid, and most of the rest are for it while also trying to use any funding bill to attach amendments that the Democratic Party won't ever vote for. And the Speaker can be recalled by any one member of the House, so any bipartisan action could threaten his position.",

It could also direct the State Department to figure out deals for training/lending equipment to get every piece of Soviet stock left in NATO/allied countries including possibly overpaying. It could also direct the State Department to work with Ukraine to secure contracts from NATO/allied countries for equipment they need, and pay for it. </p>\n\n<p>The reason I say it&#39;s noise is because while they are half doing the first point above (and maybe the other two in small amounts), there&#39;s no way a Congress member is going to stand up and say that tens of billions of US defense money should go to foreign companies. They&#39;d get torn apart by critics even if they thought it was a good idea. That&#39;s before the ideological bents even come into play: Democratic Congress members would want that money for their priorities, and Republican Congress members would either want it spent in the US or not at all. </p>\n\n<p>So where we are is where we have been. Congress wants to spend money for Ukraine, but almost exclusively to companies inside the US. It also will defer to the DoD on whether any potential drawdown is too much and would hurt US readiness. Congress members will make a lot of noise depending on what they believe will score them votes but not any real action. </p>\n\n<p>The one new and added wrinkle is that the Republican House Majority is only 5 members. A portion of those want no more aid, a portion wants only security aid, and most of the rest are for it while also trying to use any funding bill to attach amendments that the Democratic Party won&#39;t ever vote for. And the Speaker can be recalled by any one member of the House, so any bipartisan action could threaten his position.</p>\n</div>",

FY23 has financed a lot, including the ever costly Patriots and other AD, so am curious what sort of numbers you had in mind. Especially because your follow on points are highly reliant on these assumptions.\n\nAbsolutely. The two FY2023 [Ukraine supplemental funding bills - PDF warning](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12107) had a total of $35.68b in security funding. So let's use that as our baseline. Lets focus on the big 3 things that are constantly talked about that the US is uniquely positioned to do: Abrams, Bradleys, and F-16s. \n\n**F-16s**\n\nLet's start with F-16s since it is is extremely unlikely the US would be giving any. Taiwan currently has a backorder for 66 planes with support packages at $8 billion dollars - $121 million per plane. While I'm sure Ukraine would be ecstatic if the US were able to magic up 66 of them to donate, I don't think anywhere here would believe that amount would give Ukraine air superiority. It would definitely be helpful for air strikes and air defense. Perhaps twice that amount (132) but that would almost be half of this year's aid ($16 billion). Also, there's an 128 plane production backlog.\n\n**Abrams**\n\nThe US is uniquely positioned compared to other allies to have thousands of a western tanks in either storage or stockpiles it could retrofit for Ukrainian use. The current issue is production; the Lima tank factory is only putting out about 150 a year, and there's a lot spoken for already. However, earlier this year it was [stated](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/tank-manufacturing-plant-in-small-ohio-city-plays-big-role-in-ukraine-war) that they could almost double production  before adding another shift. So let's say Congress directed Lima to go full tilt and they triple the production to 500 tanks a year to take care of that. What would the cost be?\n\nPoland purchased 250 M1A2 Abrams tanks with supporting equipment and training package for $4.75b. They also purchased 116 M1A1s for $1.4b with the support package included. So that's about $19 million and $12.1 million, respectively. A Ukrainian tank battalion is 31 tanks; at $12.1 million a piece that comes out to $375 million per tank battalion. Each Ukrainian Tank Brigade has 4 battalions; so to equip a brigade - 124 tanks - of just M1A1 Abrams would be $1.5 billion. However, there aren't many M1A1s left, so using the $19 million per tank would get $589 million per battalion, and $2.356 billion per brigade.\n\n**Bradleys**\n\nBradleys are also mentioned as something unique as they are held in large quantities which is something other allies do not have. Restoration doesn't seem to be too big of an issue as since they've been announced in January, 190 have been delivered. Croatia bought 89 Bradleys for $196 million; however, this was part of an expansion of an earlier deal that had them \"purchase\" and upgrade 76 for $757 million including training on the vehicle.  Putting them together the cost is $5.77 million per vehicle. A Mechanized Infantry Battalion in Ukraine has 40-45 IFVs. Using 40, that's roughly 120 Bradleys per Mechanized Infantry Brigade - $692.4 million. \n\n.\n\nThe reason I included support packages above is because all these vehicles will require training on how to use and maintain the vehicles, spare parts for the routine maintenance, and contractor/troop costs for larger maintenance and repairs that Ukraine isn't equipped to handle, and ammunition for training and use. \n\nNone of those include things like artillery, anti-aircraft systems, MRAPs, logistic vehicles, and ammunition. Basically everything on [this list](https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/) that isn't mentioned above but is necessary to conduct the war. \n\n**So what equipment do you send and in what quantities?** \n\nThe biggest item listed above is the F-16 at $8 billion but that is pretty much not going to happen from the US as stated above.\n\nWhat about Abrams? A Bloomberg article estimated Ukraine has about 1,400 tanks. So there are roughly 1,300 Soviet style tanks with the vast majority being older T-72s that could be replaced. Using Poland's purchase as a guideline, 500 Abrams would be $9.5 billion. Which would roughly be a quarter of that $35.68 billion allocated this year. \n\nThe Bradley is also mentioned a lot about being sent in large quantities. 600 Bradleys would come out to $3.462 billion; though seeing the numbers provided and the losses they take, 1,200 would cost $6.924 billion.\n\nSo in this imaginary scenario (though I've seen it almost exactly mentioned here), 500 Abrams and 1,200 Bradleys the \"US wouldn't miss\" are sent to Ukraine for a total of $16.4 billion - roughly 45% of this year's budget. Comparatively, look at the current numbers given of Abrams and Bradleys - 31 and 190, respectively. Doing the math, that $375 million for Abrams (they're M1A1s) and roughly $1.1 billion for Bradleys for a total of roughly $1.5 billion. That's a difference of roughly $15 billion. \n\nLooking back at [the list of equipment provided since Febraury 24, 2022](https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/) which totals $42.6 billion, I have to ask what on that list won't be provided or isn't as necessary/effective that might free up that amount of money? It's an imperfect comparison, but then again I've spent six hours off and on with this post, so I'm not going to cost out every shell and ammo to get estimates of how much of each was provided. \n\nFor the most part, I believe most of it will continue to be necessary, and there isn't $15 billion in less effectual spending in there. So when I say that providing a torrent of equipment such as 500 Abrams and 1,200 would drain that amount quickly, it means in addition to the mostly necessary funding previously spent.\n\nThe part about leaving the US's stockpiles depleted is meant a prebuttal to those who would say to undervalue the costs so as to make it all fit. Doing that would handicap the replacement of equipment (and ammunition if also given), leaving stocks temporarily empty unless Congress would add more funding.   \n\n>Blinken has also indicated that Europe is willing to carry more of the humanitarian weight, while relying more on U.S. MIC for the military aid while their industry gets its act in order.\n\nUsing the info from [here](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts), the total EU+EU countries individually+non-EU countries have provided about twice as much as the US in both humanitarian and financial aid. However, they would have to boost it about another third to replace US aid. At least that's my back of the napkin math. It's late so it might not be exactly right.",

                        "body": "> I've spent six hours off and on with this post\n\nThanks for taking the time. A few points I have issue with:\n\n>Biden has very rarely vetoed bills that come to his desk\n\nBiden has vetoed 6 bills in the first 2.5 years of his 4-year first term. Bush vetoed exactly zero (I guess that's what a terrorist attack will do). But, Obama vetoed only *2* in his first term. And even Trump, the king of petulant tantrums, vetoed only 10. Even that misses the bigger point: this is a complex bill, Congress is *split*, so the entire Congress can 'instruct' State to scrounge for weapons is nothing but political spin. \n\n>Let's start with F-16s since it is is extremely unlikely the US would be giving any.\n\nWell, seeing that the 'coalition' to supply the F-16s (the 40+ planes that have been spoken of thus far) has never actually included the U.S., let's put this entire point aside for now. \n\n> Each Ukrainian Tank Brigade has 4 battalions; so to equip a brigade - 124 tanks - of just M1A1 Abrams would be $1.5 billion. However, there aren't many M1A1s left, so using the $19 million per tank would get $589 million per battalion, and $2.356 billion per brigade.\n\nOkay, let's tally up $2.4bn/brigade then. Am going to put aside the really suspect claim with the fuzzy math for now, especially seeing that Poland is getting the [SEPv3](https://www.gd.com/Articles/2022/08/25/gdls-to-provide-abrams-tanks-to-poland-under-foreign-military-sales-order) which is more costly. We also have a very good unit estimate of [$10mm](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/reversal-us-agrees-send-31-abrams-tanks-ukraine-2023-01-25/) for the A2s (including training and sustainment,) but again, not going to quibble over ~$1bn for a brigade's worth of equipment. \n\n>Putting them together the cost is $5.77 million per vehicle. A Mechanized Infantry Battalion in Ukraine has 40-45 IFVs. Using 40, that's roughly 120 Bradleys per Mechanized Infantry Brigade - $692.4 million.\n\n\nAgain, we have a better and lower estimate for the package going to Ukraine (even though it's the same ODS variant), which could indicate the replacement cost, vs. foreign sale aspect, but let's use that figure of $.7bn/brigade. \n\n>Looking back at the list of equipment provided since Febraury 24, 2022 which totals $42.6 billion, I have to ask what on that list won't be provided or isn't as necessary/effective that might free up that amount of money?\n\nThe U.S. has front loaded a lot of artillery systems. While Ukraine could always do with more, especially as they receive more artillery ammunition, for now, the demand is on the barrels more than the systems. The M777, for example, was sold to India for $0.7bn, with the numbers being roughly equal to the figure sent to Ukraine, so that's one area of cost saving (putting aside replacements for attrition). The most expensive area, as always, continues to be the Patriots and AD. AD missiles and AD systems. Unless the U.S. is planning on sending another battery to Ukraine, that's ~$1-2bn right there. Further, future missiles could be higher/lower depending on Russian missile production. Then, there are a lot of other smaller things, like the HIMARS, which the U.S. has already allocated 40 of between USAI and drawdown in 23, which is roughly at least $0.2bn. We've also heard (ad nauseum from some) that GMLRS are only being provided at a throughput level at the moment. That would mean a lot less of the $160k/missile being sent (and per the leak, over 10k have probably been sent in 23.) Ditto for stingers and javelins, where, again, we've been told U.S. inventories are lower and thus the volumes being supplied to Ukraine are going to be lower. Let's just keep in mind: you can't have it both ways. ALSO, let's not forget all the Soviet era systems that the U.S. has been paying for, which have also pretty much run out at this point. Whether that's to [refurbish](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/11/04/us-netherlands-go-dutch-to-refurbish-czech-tanks-for-ukraine/) T-72s, or buy 152mm artillery. We're close to (if not already) at the bottom of the barrel for sending those. If you add all of these up, the cost savings for what can't/won't be sent in FY24, is actually quite substantial relative to FY23. \n\n\n>So in this imaginary scenario (though I've seen it almost exactly mentioned here), 500 Abrams and 1,200 Bradleys the \"US wouldn't miss\" are sent to Ukraine for a total of $16.4 billion - roughly 45% of this year's budget.\n\nI mean, if I were to use every single statement here for pushing out numbers, then we'd be here all day. Ukraine doesn't need 500 Abrams, and quite frankly, they won't be able to use 500 Abrams (not just because of the mines, but because a lack of experienced tankers). We're already being told, whether rightly or wrongly, that Ukraine has close to parity on the tank situation relative to Russia. They might need one or two more brigades of Abrams. That's $2.4-5bn, using your almost 2x inflated unit cost numbers. To the Bradleys, I'm far from being a military expert, but perhaps they'll need 4-5 additional brigades of those. That's $3-3.5bn more. Add it together, you get to ~$7bn at the midpoint. The cost savings from the systems I've highlighted above from FY23 should cover at least 60-70% of the spillover. \n\n>The Federal government always has more many than anyone, but yet still runs a $1 trillion deficit. And since it's a Democratic President, deficits matter to Republicans so there isn't really any unspoken for money.\n\nNot clear exactly what you're saying here, but the budget for FY24 is ~$7tn. I'm not going to highlight all the pork-barrel bills in Congress, not going to highlight deficit spending under different Presidents, the waste in federal spending, or the revenue shortfall that the IRS alone could make up. Or how much was being spent in Iraq/Afghanistan. I'm not even going to say what $40bn is relative to $7tn. All I'll say is, you're going to have to make a *much* stronger argument for why $40-50bn in cost/benefit is not politically palatable. \n\n>However, they would have to boost it about another third to replace US aid.\n\nThey'll have to boost humanitarian aid by $7bn to get to the Bradleys and Abrams numbers we're discussing, assuming the U.S. can't cut anything from the FY23 aid, or $2-3bn more using my fuzzy math. We're also forgetting that even countries such as Saudi and India, along with allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia, are sending humanitarian aid, and perhaps diplomacy to get them to boost these numbers can be an area of focus. The IMF has also stepped in very recently, so that's another bonus, especially as funding for it is already allocated for in budgets.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;ve spent six hours off and on with this post</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks for taking the time. A few points I have issue with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Biden has very rarely vetoed bills that come to his desk</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Biden has vetoed 6 bills in the first 2.5 years of his 4-year first term. Bush vetoed exactly zero (I guess that&#39;s what a terrorist attack will do). But, Obama vetoed only <em>2</em> in his first term. And even Trump, the king of petulant tantrums, vetoed only 10. Even that misses the bigger point: this is a complex bill, Congress is <em>split</em>, so the entire Congress can &#39;instruct&#39; State to scrounge for weapons is nothing but political spin. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let&#39;s start with F-16s since it is is extremely unlikely the US would be giving any.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, seeing that the &#39;coalition&#39; to supply the F-16s (the 40+ planes that have been spoken of thus far) has never actually included the U.S., let&#39;s put this entire point aside for now. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each Ukrainian Tank Brigade has 4 battalions; so to equip a brigade - 124 tanks - of just M1A1 Abrams would be $1.5 billion. However, there aren&#39;t many M1A1s left, so using the $19 million per tank would get $589 million per battalion, and $2.356 billion per brigade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Okay, let&#39;s tally up $2.4bn/brigade then. Am going to put aside the really suspect claim with the fuzzy math for now, especially seeing that Poland is getting the <a href=\"https://www.gd.com/Articles/2022/08/25/gdls-to-provide-abrams-tanks-to-poland-under-foreign-military-sales-order\">SEPv3</a> which is more costly. We also have a very good unit estimate of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/reversal-us-agrees-send-31-abrams-tanks-ukraine-2023-01-25/\">$10mm</a> for the A2s (including training and sustainment,) but again, not going to quibble over ~$1bn for a brigade&#39;s worth of equipment. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Putting them together the cost is $5.77 million per vehicle. A Mechanized Infantry Battalion in Ukraine has 40-45 IFVs. Using 40, that&#39;s roughly 120 Bradleys per Mechanized Infantry Brigade - $692.4 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, we have a better and lower estimate for the package going to Ukraine (even though it&#39;s the same ODS variant), which could indicate the replacement cost, vs. foreign sale aspect, but let&#39;s use that figure of $.7bn/brigade. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking back at the list of equipment provided since Febraury 24, 2022 which totals $42.6 billion, I have to ask what on that list won&#39;t be provided or isn&#39;t as necessary/effective that might free up that amount of money?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The U.S. has front loaded a lot of artillery systems. While Ukraine could always do with more, especially as they receive more artillery ammunition, for now, the demand is on the barrels more than the systems. The M777, for example, was sold to India for $0.7bn, with the numbers being roughly equal to the figure sent to Ukraine, so that&#39;s one area of cost saving (putting aside replacements for attrition). The most expensive area, as always, continues to be the Patriots and AD. AD missiles and AD systems. Unless the U.S. is planning on sending another battery to Ukraine, that&#39;s ~$1-2bn right there. Further, future missiles could be higher/lower depending on Russian missile production. Then, there are a lot of other smaller things, like the HIMARS, which the U.S. has already allocated 40 of between USAI and drawdown in 23, which is roughly at least $0.2bn. We&#39;ve also heard (ad nauseum from some) that GMLRS are only being provided at a throughput level at the moment. That would mean a lot less of the $160k/missile being sent (and per the leak, over 10k have probably been sent in 23.) Ditto for stingers and javelins, where, again, we&#39;ve been told U.S. inventories are lower and thus the volumes being supplied to Ukraine are going to be lower. Let&#39;s just keep in mind: you can&#39;t have it both ways.

To them, the Ukraine war is just another case of the &quot;Globohomo&quot; empire trying to expand.</p>\n</div>",

It was never part of the plan, it happened \"organically.\" \n\nTanks are a fine example. Soviets in the '50s had the medium/heavy combo- T-55 and T-10. So far this is the same as the US with M48/M103 and the British with Centurion/Conqueror. \n\nThen Khruschev canned heavy tank development, so T-62 replaced T-55 and nothing replaced T-10. Again, not \\*that\\* different from the west. The US Army replaced M48 with M60 and M103 with nothing (eventually M60A1 but this was in the future) and the British replaced Centurion and Conqueror with Chieftain. The big difference was that the Soviets retained T-10 in service while the west ditched heavies ASAP. We have here the dawn of the MBT. \n\nThe Soviets also thought MBTs were a good idea. They just didn't think T-62 was a good enough tank to do the job. Kharkiv had this new medium tank with a lot of advanced features coming down the pike (T-64), so they stuck a 125mm gun on it, which matched the HE-FRAG performance of the 122mm on the heavy tank, and put it into production as T-64A. This was supposed to be the one tank that every tank factory would make and the one tank that every tank unit would use. But there were problems: the tank broke down constantly and the engine factory couldn't make the engine quickly enough. This made Dmitry Ustinov (head of Soviet MIC) very angry. So he had Chelyabinsk make a T-64A with the old V-12 diesel for wartime production only and he had Leningrad make a T-64A with a turbine engine because he liked turbine engines. \n\nInstead of doing as asked, Chelyabinsk made an entirely new tank with similar performance to T-64A and by hook and crook got it into production in peacetime- contrary to the original design goal. And Leningrad made a half-new tank with similar performance to T-64A and got it into production because Dmitry Ustinov liked turbine engines. \n\n1968: every factory will make one tank. 1975: three factories make three different tanks and their only interchangeable parts are the machine guns, main gun ammunition, and fuel. \n\nAnd then 10 years later they tried standardization thing with T-80U and ended up with three different production tanks.

                    "body": "Soviet armor wasn't obsolete until the late 80s, and even then most NATO countries were still mainly using 60s era tanks. The Soviet Armed Forces had a massive advantage in quantity and quality until the 80s. The reason was the West, especially the United States, never committed nearly enough funding to the Army as they did the other branch they intended to use to defeat the Soviet Union, which was the US Air Force, specifically the Strategic Air Command. \n\nI'd be happy to run you through the different phases of the US Army during the Cold War, the only time we even had a shred of hope to stop a Warsaw Pact without nukes was in the mid 80s, but mainly the late 80s. Before that, we were the ones planning to use nukes, tactical and strategic. \n\nThe Soviet Union was the one who first started tinkering with the ability to start WW3 with an option to not use nukes (though they'd still have used chemical weapons), which started in the 60s.

The American side lost 19 soldiers compared to hundreds of Iraqis, and 10 M60s were damaged or destroyed, most of them if not the entirety due to minefields, in contrast to hundreds of Iraqi tanks, INCLUDING T-72s destroyed by the 105mm gun of the M60. The Iraqis also had the export version of the T-72, the M1 version, the same one Ukraine received from Poland.\r  \n\r  \nI wasn't here to analyze the battle but to simply display that Western tanks between the '60s and '80s were very much capable of withholding a Soviet attack. While the Soviets held a numerical advantage, it does not necessarily mean they could've effectively employed all of their forces, given the widespread corruption at the brigade level and maintenance issues I mentioned before. Yes, they would have most likely exploited the territorial vulnerabilities of NATO countries, but that is if we assume that other Warsaw Pact countries had the same will to fight as the Soviets, considering that many of them already had a profound resentment towards the commies.\r  \n\r  \n I never said it would be an easy victory for NATO back in the days.

The American side lost 19 soldiers compared to hundreds of Iraqis, and 10 M60s were damaged or destroyed, most of them if not the entirety due to minefields, in contrast to hundreds of Iraqi tanks, INCLUDING T-72s destroyed by the 105mm gun of the M60. The Iraqis also had the export version of the T-72, the M1 version, the same one Ukraine received from Poland.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t here to analyze the battle but to simply display that Western tanks between the &#39;60s and &#39;80s were very much capable of withholding a Soviet attack. While the Soviets held a numerical advantage, it does not necessarily mean they could&#39;ve effectively employed all of their forces, given the widespread corruption at the brigade level and maintenance issues I mentioned before. Yes, they would have most likely exploited the territorial vulnerabilities of NATO countries, but that is if we assume that other Warsaw Pact countries had the same will to fight as the Soviets, considering that many of them already had a profound resentment towards the commies.</p>\n\n<p>I never said it would be an easy victory for NATO back in the days.

        "body": "So for the last decade the Bundeswehr only had two main groundbased air defence systems. Firstly the Patriot which has shown its value in Ukraine. Secondly the ozelot, a Wiesel based stinger carrying tankette. \n\nNow because of the new safety politics regarding Russia, the Bundeswehr wants to expand its air defence capabilities. \n\nThis will happen in the European Skyshield initiative.\n\nThis initiative will have several components, which will be operated split by distance by the Luftwaffe and the Land forces. \n\n-The Luftwaffe for long distances over 35 km \n-And the Heer under 12 km.\n\nThis pictures shows the components of the luftwaffe: \nhttps://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/assets/Aktuell/2023A02/images/2023A02_european_sky_shield_initiative_001.png\n\n-Arrow 3, 2400km range + 100km ceiling, against Hypersonic missiles + ballistic missiles and potentially even satellites, operated by Luftwaffe \n\n-Patriot, 160 km range + 36 km ceiling, ballistic missiles + planes + drones + helicopters, operated by Lufwaffe \n\n-Iris-t SLM, 40 km range + 20 km ceiling, ballistic short-range missiles + planes + drones + helicopters, operated by luftwaffe\n\nAt this point is a cut and the following systems will be operated by the Bundeswehr Land forces.\n\nIris-t SLS, 12 km range + 8 km ceiling, ballistic short-range missiles + planes + drones + helicopters, operated by Bundeswehr \n\nSkyranger 30 with stinger missiles, 3km gun range, 5-6 km stinger range, Helicopters + planes + especially drones, operated by Bundeswehr. \n\nI think that the especially the long range systems like Arrow 3, Patriot and Iris T SLM are highly effective and give the Bundeswehr the abilities to protect assets with a multilayered air defence from future air defences. \n\nEven though I would have preferred Iris T SLM also to be operated by the Landforces, it is good that the landforces have their own air defence capabilities, even if they are limited. \n\n\nMy question focuses on the Short air defence by the land forces though. \n\nThe Land forces are currently in the process of building up \u201cmedium forces\u201d which mainly will be 8x8 GTK Boxer based fighting vehicles with IFVs,artillery, Air-defense etc. \n\nFor Air-Defense two vehicles are planed. \nA Boxer with 4-6 Iris T SLS + Radar. \n\nhttps://esut.de/2022/10/fachbeitraege/37352/nnbs-arge-partnerunternehmen-praesentieren-flugabwehrraketenboxer/\n\nAnd Rheinmetalls Skyranger 30 with Air defence missiles which will most likely be stinger missiles. And predecessor of this version was the Skyranger 35/Mantis which is able to fit on the boxer but too heavy with a turret weight of 4.5 tons to fit on 6x6 AFVs of other European nations in the skyshield initiative. The Skyranger 30 only weights 2.5-3.5 tons and even has missiles.   \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyranger_30\n\n\n\nMy question is, why doesn\u2019t the Bundeswehr combine the two vehicles into one? \n\nThe stingers don\u2019t really give that big of an advantage for the Skyranger, as the 30mm gun has a large range already. \nThe stingers also don\u2019t have enough range to reach drones in medium altitude or helicopters with modern atgms like the KA-52s\n\nThe Iris t carrier on the other hand can\u2019t even defend cheaply from drones, but would need to fire a 400k\u20ac missile every time. A 30 mm shell with time fuse for the Skyranger 30 costs 1000\u20ac on the other hand. Very Price efficient. \n\nSo now you have two vehicles which have to work together closely to protect each other. \n\nFrom a price point it also doesn\u2019t really make sense, as the GTK boxer is a rather expensive base vehicle. \nThe stinger also doesn\u2019t make sense as it currently also costs 400k\u20ac. For the same price you get a Iris T SLS with far more range. \n\nhttps://www.eurasiantimes.com/new-ukraine-war-a-25k-atgm-now-sells-for-400k-us-defense/?amp\n\nAdditionally the radar of the Skyranger 30 has a detection range long enough for the Iris t sls. \n\nI found a 3D model online of both the Iris T and the Skyranger 30. I believe it would be possible to fit [2](https://imgur.com/a/39EHYPu) or [4](https://imgur.com/a/FYymZVr) missiles into the vehicle. The weight should not be a problem, as the boxer should have at least 2 tons more capacity. \n\nDoes anyone know why the Bundeswehr wants 2 vehicles? The trend towards the end of the Cold War also went to combining guns with 10 km+  lrange rockets with the 2s6 Tunguska and the ADATS.  \nI only see advantages combining the two. \n\nIn general what are your thoughts on the direction Germany and Europe are heading for air defence?",

Secondly the ozelot, a Wiesel based stinger carrying tankette. </p>\n\n<p>Now because of the new safety politics regarding Russia, the Bundeswehr wants to expand its air defence capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>This will happen in the European Skyshield initiative.</p>\n\n<p>This initiative will have several components, which will be operated split by distance by the Luftwaffe and the Land forces. </p>\n\n<p>-The Luftwaffe for long distances over 35 km \n-And the Heer under 12 km.</p>\n\n<p>This pictures shows the components of the luftwaffe: \n<a href=\"https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/assets/Aktuell/2023A02/images/2023A02_european_sky_shield_initiative_001.png\">https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/assets/Aktuell/2023A02/images/2023A02_european_sky_shield_initiative_001.png</a></p>\n\n<p>-Arrow 3, 2400km range + 100km ceiling, against Hypersonic missiles + ballistic missiles and potentially even satellites, operated by Luftwaffe </p>\n\n<p>-Patriot, 160 km range + 36 km ceiling, ballistic missiles + planes + drones + helicopters, operated by Lufwaffe </p>\n\n<p>-Iris-t SLM, 40 km range + 20 km ceiling, ballistic short-range missiles + planes + drones + helicopters, operated by luftwaffe</p>\n\n<p>At this point is a cut and the following systems will be operated by the Bundeswehr Land forces.</p>\n\n<p>Iris-t SLS, 12 km range + 8 km ceiling, ballistic short-range missiles + planes + drones + helicopters, operated by Bundeswehr </p>\n\n<p>Skyranger 30 with stinger missiles, 3km gun range, 5-6 km stinger range, Helicopters + planes + especially drones, operated by Bundeswehr. </p>\n\n<p>I think that the especially the long range systems like Arrow 3, Patriot and Iris T SLM are highly effective and give the Bundeswehr the abilities to protect assets with a multilayered air defence from future air defences. </p>\n\n<p>Even though I would have preferred Iris T SLM also to be operated by the Landforces, it is good that the landforces have their own air defence capabilities, even if they are limited. </p>\n\n<p>My question focuses on the Short air defence by the land forces though. </p>\n\n<p>The Land forces are currently in the process of building up \u201cmedium forces\u201d which mainly will be 8x8 GTK Boxer based fighting vehicles with IFVs,artillery, Air-defense etc. </p>\n\n<p>For Air-Defense two vehicles are planed. \nA Boxer with 4-6 Iris T SLS + Radar. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://esut.de/2022/10/fachbeitraege/37352/nnbs-arge-partnerunternehmen-praesentieren-flugabwehrraketenboxer/\">https://esut.de/2022/10/fachbeitraege/37352/nnbs-arge-partnerunternehmen-praesentieren-flugabwehrraketenboxer/</a></p>\n\n<p>And Rheinmetalls Skyranger 30 with Air defence missiles which will most likely be stinger missiles. And predecessor of this version was the Skyranger 35/Mantis which is able to fit on the boxer but too heavy with a turret weight of 4.5 tons to fit on 6x6 AFVs of other European nations in the skyshield initiative. The Skyranger 30 only weights 2.5-3.5 tons and even has missiles.   </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyranger_30\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyranger_30</a></p>\n\n<p>My question is, why doesn\u2019t the Bundeswehr combine the two vehicles into one? </p>\n\n<p>The stingers don\u2019t really give that big of an advantage for the Skyranger, as the 30mm gun has a large range already. \nThe stingers also don\u2019t have enough range to reach drones in medium altitude or helicopters with modern atgms like the KA-52s</p>\n\n<p>The Iris t carrier on the other hand can\u2019t even defend cheaply from drones, but would need to fire a 400k\u20ac missile every time. A 30 mm shell with time fuse for the Skyranger 30 costs 1000\u20ac on the other hand. Very Price efficient. </p>\n\n<p>So now you have two vehicles which have to work together closely to protect each other. </p>\n\n<p>From a price point it also doesn\u2019t really make sense, as the GTK boxer is a rather expensive base vehicle. \nThe stinger also doesn\u2019t make sense as it currently also costs 400k\u20ac. For the same price you get a Iris T SLS with far more range. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eurasiantimes.com/new-ukraine-war-a-25k-atgm-now-sells-for-400k-us-defense/?amp\">https://www.eurasiantimes.com/new-ukraine-war-a-25k-atgm-now-sells-for-400k-us-defense/?amp</a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally the radar of the Skyranger 30 has a detection range long enough for the Iris t sls. </p>\n\n<p>I found a 3D model online of both the Iris T and the Skyranger 30. I believe it would be possible to fit <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/39EHYPu\">2</a> or <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/FYymZVr\">4</a> missiles into the vehicle. The weight should not be a problem, as the boxer should have at least 2 tons more capacity. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know why the Bundeswehr wants 2 vehicles? The trend towards the end of the Cold War also went to combining guns with 10 km+  lrange rockets with the 2s6 Tunguska and the ADATS.<br/>\nI only see advantages combining the two. </p>\n\n<p>In general what are your thoughts on the direction Germany and Europe are heading for air defence?</p>\n</div>",

No orders were issued for most of the day, the officials said.**\n\n>**The Russian president had been warned by the Russian security services at least two or three days ahead of time that Prigozhin was preparing a possible rebellion,** according to intelligence assessments shared with The Washington Post. **Steps were taken to boost security at several strategic facilities, including the Kremlin, where staffing in the presidential guard was increased and more weapons were handed out, but otherwise no actions were taken, these officials said.**\n\n>\u201cPutin had time to take the decision to liquidate [the rebellion] and arrest the organizers\u201d said one of the European security officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. \u201cThen when it began to happen, there was paralysis on all levels \u2026 There was absolute dismay and confusion. For a long time, they did not know how to react.\u201d\n\n>This account of the standoff, corroborated by officials in Western governments, provides the most detailed look at the paralysis and disarray inside the Kremlin during the first hours of the severest challenge to Putin\u2019s 23-year presidency. It is consistent with public comments by CIA Director William J. Burns last week that for much of the 36 hours of the mutiny Russian security services, the military and decision-makers \u201cappeared to be adrift.\u201d\n\n>It also appears to expose Putin\u2019s fear of directly countering a renegade warlord who\u2019d developed support within Russia\u2019s security establishment over a decade. Prigozhin had become an integral part of the Kremlin global operations by running troll farms disseminating disinformation in the United States and paramilitary operations in the Middle East and Africa, before officially taking a vanguard position in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\n>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Post that the intelligence assessments were \u201cnonsense\u201d and shared \u201cby people who have zero information.\u201d\n\n>The longtime symbiosis of the two men, who first met in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s, has exposed the weaknesses of Putin\u2019s crony system of management, where rival clans are pitted against each other, and which has been stretched to breaking point by the war.\n\n>The lack of orders from the Kremlin\u2019s top command left local officials to decide for themselves how to act, according to the European security officials, when Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner troops stunned the world by entering the southern Russian city of Rostov in the early hours of June 24, seizing control of the Russian military\u2019s main command center there, and then moved into the city of Voronezh, before heading further north toward Moscow.\n\n>Without any clear orders, local military and security chiefs took the decision not to try to stop the heavily armed Wagner troops, the security officials said.\n\n>Many on the local level could not believe the Wagner rebellion could be happening without some degree of agreement with the Kremlin, the security officials said \u2014 despite Putin\u2019s emergency televised address to the nation on the morning of the mutiny in which he vowed tough action to stop the rebels, and despite a warrant issued for Prigozhin\u2019s arrest for \u201cincitement to insurrection\u201d on the eve of his march to Moscow.\n\n>\u201cThe local authorities did not receive any commands from the leadership,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian security official. \u201cFrom our point of view this is the biggest sign of the unhealthy situation inside Russia. The authoritarian system is formed in such a way that without a very clear command from the leadership, people don\u2019t do anything. When the leadership is in turmoil and disarray, it the same situation at the local level and even worse.\u201d\n\n>The intelligence information helps explain what\u2019s been seen as the biggest debacle of Putin\u2019s rule \u2014 how Prigozhin\u2019s armed band of fighters, demanding the ouster of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and armed forces chief of staff Valery Gerasimov, were able to proceed to within 120 miles of Moscow without facing resistance, before eventually agreeing to turn around after a deal was brokered with the help of Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president.\n\n>The disarray in the Kremlin also reflects a deepening divide inside Russia\u2019s security and military establishment over the conduct of the war in Ukraine, with many including in the upper reaches of the security services and military supporting Prigozhin\u2019s drive to oust Russia\u2019s top military leadership, the European security officials said.\n\n>\u201cSome supported Prigozhin and the idea that the leadership needs to be cleaned up, that the fish is rotting from the head,\u201d one of these officials said.\n\n>One senior NATO official said some senior figures in Moscow appeared ready to rally behind Prigozhin had he succeeded in achieving his demands. \u201cThere seem to have been important people in the power structures \u2026 who seem to have even been sort of waiting for this, as if his attempt had been more successful, they would also\u201d have joined the plot, this official said.\n\n>Prigozhin\u2019s increasingly vitriolic tirades blaming corruption and mismanagement by the Russian military command for battlefield setbacks and high casualties in the war against Ukraine had resonated with many sectors of Russian society. Many in the rank and file of the Russian army also wanted Prigozhin to succeed in forcing change at the top of the Russian military, believing that then \u201cit would become easier for them to fight,\u201d this official said.\n\n>But others in the security establishment were horrified at the mutiny attempt, and at the Kremlin\u2019s toothless reaction, convinced it was leading Russia toward a period of deep turmoil, officials said.\n\n>\u201cThere was disarray. You could argue about the depth of it, but there really was lack of agreement,\u201d said a senior member of Russian diplomatic circles. \u201cWe heard all these statements. They were not always consistent \u2026 For some time, they did not know how to react,\u201d he said. Putin had vowed to crush the rebellion on the morning the rebellion began but by the time he finally emerged in public more than 48 hours later, he said all steps had been taken on his \u201cdirect order\u201d to avoid major bloodshed.\n\n>Members of the Russian elite said the division over the conduct of the war and its handling by the Russian military leadership, will continue, despite a public relations drive by the Kremlin to demonstrate Putin is in control and the start of a campaign to purge the ranks of the Russian military of critics and Prigozhin\u2019s supporters among Russian ultranationalists.\n\n>On Friday Igor Girkin, a controversial former Russian commander in Ukraine who has been vocal in denouncing the Russian military leadership, was arrested. Several high-ranking generals perceived to be close to Prigozhin, including Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who was often praised by the Wagner leader, have disappeared from public view.\n\n>The lack of direction from the Kremlin during the crisis has left Putin significantly weakened, according to his critics. \u201cPutin showed himself to be a person who is not able to make serious, important and quick decisions in critical situations. He just hid,\u201d said Gennady Gudkov, a former colonel in the Russian security services who is now an opposition politician in exile. \u201cThis was not understood by most of the Russian population. But it was very well understood by Putin\u2019s elite. He is no longer the guarantor of their security and the preservation of the system.\u201d\n\n>\u201cRussia is a country of mafia rules. And Putin made an unforgivable mistake,\u201d said a senior Moscow financier with ties to the Russian intelligence services. \u201cHe lost his reputation as the toughest man in town.\u201d\n\n>The conflict between Prigozhin and the Russian military leadership had been building up for months, and the possibility of conflict increased sharply when the Russian Defense Ministry decreed June 10 that Wagner fighters had to sign contracts with the ministry from July 1, essentially ending Prigozhin\u2019s control of the mercenary group \u2014 and the billions of dollars in government contracts attached to it.\n\n>When the security service warnings appeared that Prigozhin could be mounting some kind of rebellion, some in the security establishment believed the preparations could be no more than a bluff to increase pressure and gain more leverage to secure his control of Wagner, one of the European security officials said.\n\n>To some degree, if Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny was an attempt to gain leverage, it worked. Putin was apparently forced into compromise with the renegade leader, allowing him to travel around Russia for days after the mutiny, because Prigozhin\u2019s work for the Kremlin was too deeply intertwined with the interests of Putin\u2019s state, according to several of the security officials, and Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled human rights activist who has interviewed several former Wagner fighters. Instead of prosecuting Prigozhin for leading the armed insurrection, Putin agreed to drop the charges. In exchange, Prigozhin halted the march on Moscow, withdrew his men from key military installations and agreed to decamp to Belarus, keeping at least part of Wagner intact.",

                "body": "I'm... as far as one can get from being a fan of Putin, and I'm also decidedly not fond of the popular Western reading that he's some sort of careful mastermind who employs umpteen layers of deception then acts decisively -- he's very much a Soviet aparatchik, who employs a very orthodox Soviet opportunism, only with a more dubious and less coherent ideology, and a long history of *not* acting decisively.\n\nHowever, I'd be wary of reading too much into an early absence of orders for local authorities. It may indeed point at a sort of \"paralysis\" in higher echelons of power but it may also be deliberate.\n\nThere are a lot of layers between top leadership and local authorities, and in the absence of a tradition of rule of law, what holds this hierarchy together is loyalty and a risk/reward balance. Issuing orders to local authorities runs the risk of having them disobeyed and swelling the support of a revolt; deliberately witholding them puts challengers in a tight spot, as they need to quickly and decisively show early success to secure local support, and can force their hand when dealing with local authorities.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why, going all the way back to the Soviet era, the suppression of dissent was very well centralized, even though economically, logistically and tactically it made more sense to have it handled at a local level. Not only the Soviet Union, but most of the Eastern Bloc countries maintained units like the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft (East Germany) or ZOMO (Poland), with special command structures that bypassed most of the command hierarchy. When the brown stuff hit the spinning blades, this enabled nearly-immediate local action without demanding too much from the local authorities -- which, for most of the Cold War, didn't necessarily lack loyalty, but more often than not lacked command-level competence on account of corruption and political selection.\n\nThat certainly did result in a great deal of disarray at local government level in times of crisis, absolutely, and this is a major weakness in general. It's one of the things that precipitated the disintegration of communist regimes whenever the turmoil of the late 80s/early 90s turned hot.\n\nBut absence of orders alone, without knowledge of what caused it, is not an immediate indicator of how things are going at the top. Was it because Putin was crying hugging his knees in the bathroom, fearing that he may have escaped Dresden without a prolapse but was now dramatically certain that he's getting the Gaddafi Backdoor Special? Or was it because Putin had sufficient control over enough armed personnel to block any serious move by Wagner into Moscow, and thus decided that testing local leaders' efficiency and loyalty just isn't worth the risk?\n\nIt's often the case that the answer is in fact a bit of both -- authoritarian leaders frequently find defensible ways to frame both the fear of testing their grasp on power and their own brittle egos. But in this case I don't think there's enough information to know.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m... as far as one can get from being a fan of Putin, and I&#39;m also decidedly not fond of the popular Western reading that he&#39;s some sort of careful mastermind who employs umpteen layers of deception then acts decisively -- he&#39;s very much a Soviet aparatchik, who employs a very orthodox Soviet opportunism, only with a more dubious and less coherent ideology, and a long history of <em>not</em> acting decisively.</p>\n\n<p>However, I&#39;d be wary of reading too much into an early absence of orders for local authorities. It may indeed point at a sort of &quot;paralysis&quot; in higher echelons of power but it may also be deliberate.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of layers between top leadership and local authorities, and in the absence of a tradition of rule of law, what holds this hierarchy together is loyalty and a risk/reward balance. Issuing orders to local authorities runs the risk of having them disobeyed and swelling the support of a revolt; deliberately witholding them puts challengers in a tight spot, as they need to quickly and decisively show early success to secure local support, and can force their hand when dealing with local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>That is one of the reasons why, going all the way back to the Soviet era, the suppression of dissent was very well centralized, even though economically, logistically and tactically it made more sense to have it handled at a local level. Not only the Soviet Union, but most of the Eastern Bloc countries maintained units like the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft (East Germany) or ZOMO (Poland), with special command structures that bypassed most of the command hierarchy. When the brown stuff hit the spinning blades, this enabled nearly-immediate local action without demanding too much from the local authorities -- which, for most of the Cold War, didn&#39;t necessarily lack loyalty, but more often than not lacked command-level competence on account of corruption and political selection.</p>\n\n<p>That certainly did result in a great deal of disarray at local government level in times of crisis, absolutely, and this is a major weakness in general. It&#39;s one of the things that precipitated the disintegration of communist regimes whenever the turmoil of the late 80s/early 90s turned hot.</p>\n\n<p>But absence of orders alone, without knowledge of what caused it, is not an immediate indicator of how things are going at the top. Was it because Putin was crying hugging his knees in the bathroom, fearing that he may have escaped Dresden without a prolapse but was now dramatically certain that he&#39;s getting the Gaddafi Backdoor Special? Or was it because Putin had sufficient control over enough armed personnel to block any serious move by Wagner into Moscow, and thus decided that testing local leaders&#39; efficiency and loyalty just isn&#39;t worth the risk?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s often the case that the answer is in fact a bit of both -- authoritarian leaders frequently find defensible ways to frame both the fear of testing their grasp on power and their own brittle egos. But in this case I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough information to know.</p>\n</div>",

Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Odobescu discussed the strong U.S.-Romania strategic partnership and opportunities for continued bilateral and multilateral cooperation, <strong>including collective security and unwavering support for Ukraine and Moldova, global food security, and cooperation on Black Sea security.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-call-with-romanian-foreign-minister-odobescu/\">https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-call-with-romanian-foreign-minister-odobescu/</a></p>\n\n<p>RE the point of your post, I suspect incidents like this will lead to further calls for strengthening the eastern flank more generally: a lot of such discourse has generally focused on Poland and the Baltic nations, but not Romania and the other nations to the west of the Carpathian mountains as they&#39;ve been far less exposed to hostilities.</p>\n</div>",

It's literally that simple.\n\n>Presumably if Ukraine ceded Bakhmut the Wagner attacks would have happened elsewhere\n\nWhere?

How long to run the probing attacks needed just to pinpoint Ukraine defenses and know where the minefields and strongpoints are? The smart time to retreat was March 1, mud season ends by mid May at the latest, giving 2.5 months and then it's UAF offensive time and Wagner needs to keep one eye over it's shoulder. \n\nFurthermore, which other sector in Ukraine gives Wagner an advantage like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqOy_TLWAAA6mzl?format=jpg&name=large) thanks to the tactical situation?

So if the Ukrainians switch to fighting in the East they can't reach any place that's strategically important even if they break through the current front lines.\n\nSo their strategy for such an offensive becoming the main effort can only be minor liberation of territory with the greater objective being attrition of Russian forces. That's a dangerous game to play, because they have to take on the VDV if they really want to attrit the right Russian forces. I generally don't advocate attrition strategy unless all other options won't work, or if performing defensive ops doing a maneuver defense. \n\nI'm at a wait and see approach for the South. I don't expect miracles due to DPICM injection but they are getting enough rounds in a short term to push them well into 15-20k shells per day fire rates, something they've not really achieved before. While they can't move deep with dismounted attacks they can get into the defensive works that way and trigger counterattacks by the better quality Russian units, so maybe that's what's happening. They've said they switched to an attritional strategy there, I'd like to see it play out. \n\nPlus the Russians chose to not perform a maneuver defense there, at least not at the operational level. They aren't voluntarily retreating to avoid being decisively engaged, not trying to trade space for lives, not trying to pull the Ukrainians deeper into the defensive nightmare, force them into salients that are actually big ambushes, etc. Instead still fighting hard, Hold at all cost, trying to limit Ukraine advances so they publicly can't claim victory moving forward (again the oddity of this war how both sides choose strategy based on trending on social media). And facing pretty heavy attrition for what amounts to defending the least impressive outpost line of defenses. So it's possible they might get hurt bad enough in the near term that when retreats are required they'll have trouble in later fights due to a lack of fresh units. \n\nThough I still have doubts the Ukrainians will reach anywhere close to the Azov coast.",

The assassination was in another country and, while increased alertness is not an insane response, a reasonable person ought to have realised that no attack was coming by that point. It turned out to be considerable amateurism from the IRGC and in reality there was nothing in the air for them to shoot at *except* innocent people. Though, on the other hand, they weren't really to know that.\n\nThere were supposedly a few thousand extra deaths from the switch to road travel from air travel immediately after 9/11. I would pin a share of the blame for those on the perpetrators in a similar way. Same with health issues among survivors and emergency services. After all, these were not random acts in an inscrutable universe, they were plainly caused by the attack.\n\nIf Iranian agents had assassinated General Mattis in Canada with an RPG, then they (or Iran) would naturally bear some responsibility for what came next. You can't just commit acts of violence then call no-touchies and blame everything on the person you attacked.\n\nBut this is all by the by.\n\nThe missiles heading into Ukraine are real, there have been thousands (?) over the course of almost 18 months.
