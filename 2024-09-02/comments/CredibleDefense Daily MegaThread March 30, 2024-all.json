Taurus is a joint venture between MBDA and Saab. MBDA also produces Meteor, Storm Shadow and other missiles.\n\nHe discusses what Germany has ordered, the problems with procurement and how small and infrequent orders are hurting the military industry.\n \nTranslation (part 1/2):\n\n**Mr. Gottschild, as the German head of the European armaments company MBDA, you are also the master of the Taurus. You are certainly often asked about the precision-striking cruise missile that Chancellor Olaf Scholz does not want to supply to Ukraine from Bundeswehr stocks.**\n\nThomas Gottschild: Whether and under what conditions Taurus cruise missiles are delivered to Ukraine is a political decision by the German government, which I do not comment on. \n\n**That's a shame. But you certainly will talk about the properties of the 1,400 kilogram weapon.**\n\nGottschild: The Taurus has a large stand-off effect, meaning it can fly more than 500 kilometers. This capability profile is in high demand in Ukraine in particular in order to combat logistics chains and strategic targets. That is why there is so much focus on this topic. \n\n**Military experts say of the Taurus' capabilities that the enemy only notices the cruise missile when it strikes.**\n\nGottschild: The Taurus is able to fly very low, even through valleys, which makes it a bit special. As a result, it is only noticed very late by radar or other reconnaissance equipment. \n\n**The Taurus is a dangerous weapon.**\n\nGottschild: The Taurus belongs in a kit for modern warfare. Ukraine currently covers its stand-off capability with other weapons. From the Ukrainians' point of view, however, the Taurus would be an important supplementary component in the current situation. But once again: it is not up to us to decide whether to supply Ukraine and hand over the Taurus. That is a political decision. \n\n**Around 600 Taurus cruise missiles for the German armed forces were built at the MBDA site in Schrobenhausen, Upper Bavaria.**\n\nGottschild: The production line for the Taurus, the test devices and the corresponding halls are still available. We could start production of the Taurus at any time. But we would need a new order for these weapons. \n\n**You cannot start production overnight; after all, the many suppliers also have to ramp up their production again.**\n\nGottschild: It is a challenge for our industry when production is interrupted, as is the case with the Taurus. This is because our suppliers, which are often small and medium-sized companies, have stopped production in such cases. They often cannot afford financially to maintain production lines. So if we were to receive new orders for the Taurus, our suppliers would first have to reposition themselves and secure the raw materials they need, for example.\n\n**You can't buy armaments off the shelf, as some politicians would want.**\n\nGottschild: The law prohibits us from producing for stockpiling; this requires approval from the federal government based on orders. These have not materialized in the past. Regardless of this, there is always a lead time to be able to deliver. The defense industry cannot work miracles: We get the order today and can deliver tomorrow - that doesn't work. That's why we always point out in discussions with politicians how much we depend on being able to plan orders. The defense industry needs long-term orders in order to be able to provide capabilities at short notice in the future.\n\n**However, Germany has cut the Bundeswehr to the bone, which is also hurting the domestic arms industry.**\n\nGottschild: The arms industry needs a base load in production so that we can keep the production of certain weapons running. We don't always have to produce at full speed, it's enough that it's worth maintaining supply chains, keeping test equipment up to date and retaining the skills of the workforce. Then we can ramp up production again very quickly in an emergency, as we are doing now.\n\n**Which in many cases was not possible after Russia's attack on Ukraine.**\n\nGottschild: What is happening right now must not happen to us again. If we interrupt production, the same problem as today will occur again. Then we have to start everything up again. \n\n**So you need more reliability from politicians.**\n\nGottschild: Ultimately, the defense industry needs orders. We do make advance investments, but there are limits. It is regrettable if a lot of time is allowed to pass. We can do much better and faster here in Germany. However, the procurement processes on the customer side have already improved significantly. However, there is still a lot of potential to procure military equipment more quickly, particularly in terms of certification and qualification.\n\n**You've already announced significant investments.**\n\nGottschild: As MBDA Germany, we are investing over 200 million euros in our sites over the next four years in order to ramp up our production lines. \n\n**To do this, you need more employees.**\n\nGottschild: We already hired additional employees last year. By the end of next year, we will have created around 300 additional jobs, mainly at our site in Schrobenhausen. Some new jobs will also be created at our subsidiary Bayern-Chemie in Aschau am Inn. Schrobenhausen currently employs just under 1000 of our total workforce of around 1200 in Germany. We are also dependent on a long-term perspective from politicians when it comes to expanding our workforce.\n\n**Are you making the 200 million euro investment in advance or are there already clear signals from the federal government for additional orders?**\n\nGottschild: There are many signals, but we also need contracts. We now have some confidence that these contracts will be concluded. Of course, we are also taking risks when it comes to expanding locations and financing new products, for example. \n\n**The magic formula for an efficient arms industry is therefore the continuity of orders. The poison, on the other hand, is receiving too few orders for a long time and then suddenly receiving too many orders.**\n\nGottschild: But there are also positive examples such as the Patriot ground-based air defense missile system. Here, several countries have joined forces on the initiative of Germany to place follow-up orders. MBDA was awarded a contract with its US partner Raytheon via a joint venture to manufacture up to 1,000 missiles, which will be produced in Schrobenhausen. The contract is for ten years. We can invest on this basis.\n\n**When will the first Patriot missiles be produced in Schrobenhausen?**\n\nGottschild: The contract has been signed. The final production of the missiles will take place in Schrobenhausen. We are currently planning the construction of the production facility for the engine in Aschau. We will deliver the first Patriot missiles within three years. \n\n**So even with the Patriot missiles, it won't happen as quickly as politicians would like. The Bundeswehr cannot drive up to the arms supermarket with a shopping cart and pack the weapons it wants.**\n\nGottschild: If the shelf is empty, you can't take anything out, especially as our products are highly complex. Safety is the top priority in the production of weapons, and we must not take any unnecessary risks here. The German arms industry was used to producing small series in a highly specialized and high-tech manufacturing plant. Looking at the course of the war in Ukraine, it is clear that we need both high technology and mass production, especially when it comes to ammunition. We have a backlog in terms of ammunition.\n\n**It will certainly take years before the Bundeswehr is ready for war, as Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said. Or, as some say, ready for defense.**\n\n\\[Translator's note: Pistorius' use of the word \"war\" instead of \"defense\" is controversial in German pacifist circles. See for example [this opinion piece](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/meinung/pistorius-kriegstuechtig-verteidigung-ukraine-putin-kommentar-1.6300507) in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\\] \n\nGottschild: I think war-readiness is an apt word. Defense Minister Pistorius is clear in his language. He is pushing things forward. The translation into contracts for our industry has begun. The willingness to take risks must now increase on both sides, i.e. in terms of politics and the defense industry. That way we can speed up the production of military equipment. \n\n**To what extent does MBDA benefit from Germany's the 100 billion euros Bundeswehr's \"paradigm shift\" fund?**\n\nGottschild: The biggest order so far has been Patriot. We are hoping for further ammunition orders this year. Some of these orders have already been negotiated, but still have to go through the parliamentary process. We are not yet giving details. But one thing is certain: Germany must order more ammunition for the Bundeswehr. As far as Ukraine is concerned, we are making good progress here. Platforms, such as aircraft that are ordered without weapons, naturally do not achieve the desired effect. Unfortunately, in the past such platforms were often ordered without weapons. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is clear that we must always order weapons at the same time.",

            "body": "Part 2/2:\n\n**It would certainly make sense for the Bundeswehr to overhaul old Taurus weapons first, i.e. bring them up to the latest technological standard.**\n\nGottschild: That is our great wish. We are available for corresponding orders from the federal government at any time of the day or night. Here, too, we need an order. In any case, the Taurus, which was previously carried by the Tornado, will be qualified for the Eurofighter when this fighter aircraft is phased out.\n\n**But Germany has ordered American F-35 stealth bombers to replace part of the Tornado aircraft fleet and has also ordered US weapons for this purpose. Did that annoy you?**\n\nGottschild: I regret that Germany has only ordered American weapons for the F-35, i.e. is taking the package as it is. In other countries, the F-35 will fly with weapons such as our Meteor missile, which can be used to combat threats in the air. MBDA Germany is part of the European MBDA Group, which in turn is a joint venture between Airbus, the British company BAE Systems and the Italian company Leonardo. We are the only European missile company that can compete with the Americans in the international missile systems market. \n\n**Plenty of explosives are needed to produce weapons such as the Meteor or the Taurus. There are shortages here in Europe.**\n\nGottschild: There are different types of explosives, and one particular type is not easy to obtain. Capacity must be increased here and production facilities should be set up in Germany or at least in Europe. We need more explosives. The bottlenecks are mainly in the raw materials for the explosives that we buy in. Demand here has skyrocketed worldwide. We process the explosives and use them to build warheads. \n\n**Has the paradigm shift proclaimed by Chancellor Scholz already been embraced in people's minds?**\n\nGottschild: In mine, yes. I see the paradigm shift as a process that was set in motion at a gallop and is now slowly reaching people. We haven't reached our goal yet. We are trying to speed up, but this is still happening with a peacetime mentality. We need a complete rethink here. And we need more European armaments cooperation again, especially with France. I am very grateful to Bavaria's Minister President Markus S\u00f6der for clearly addressing this during his visit to us in Schrobenhausen. European armaments cooperation is so important because it enables us to create more mass and endurance.\n\n**In the end, Germany will only be defense-capable again if companies like MBDA can find enough skilled workers. Is that happening?**\n\nGottschild: We get the workers we need. Last year, we received an average of around 400 applications per month; at the beginning of this year, the number shot up to 800 per month. Across the board, we are getting the people we need. This ensures our growth. \n\n**Are the applicants now emphasizing their desire to serve the security of Germany?**\n\nGottschild: We have been receiving applications with such motivations since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. But it has always been the case: Those who build guided missiles or warheads with us must stand behind this work.",

It works if you have a clear line of sight to the target and isn't susceptible to counter-measures. But you trade your manoeuvrability, can't turn more than 180 degrees without risk of tangling yourself, that fibre optic leads straight back to wherever you launched it from. A treeline becomes th most OP counter measure in the history of counter measures. Dunno, maybe something will evolve from it, but I don't rate it yet.\n\n> A: other ukrainian units are doing it too. I think it might eliminate a lot of the end-manuevering FPVs can do as you're afraid of cable snaps\n\n> meme answer: time to lay a lot more razor wire\n\n\u3164\n\n>Q: Are there any specific drone or anti-drone capabilities you wish you had, such as jamming systems, semi-automated kinetic defences, etc?\n\n>A: a stryker MSHORAD with the laser\n\n>but realistically, something similar to MADIS with a LW25 or AGL would be very nice\n\n>A: We have an ever growing wish list of capabilities. Specifics I won't get into, but the unfortunate fact is, EW kit or something similar is incredibly expensive. And if it's expensive, the closer to the front, the higher the risk of losing it. The further back it is, the less reliable it is.\n\n\u3164\n\n>Q: With the danger drones pose to ground vehicles what anti drone counter measures do you think they will incorporate into future designs?\n\n>A: jammers are already being mounted, but I think the real solution will be basically networked mini-AA on vehicles. With autotracking/autonomous munitions coming that's the only thing that will be future proof\n\n\u3164\n\n>Q: Is it a problem that friendly drones can not be discerned from enemy drones and then can be targeted?\n\n>A: oh yeah that happens quite a bit. it's deconflicted by radio but that doesn't always work\n\n\u3164\n\n>Q: navigation with FPV. i assume you don't have the GPS on the overlay or controller? or at least none is visible on the footage. is there a compass or a bearing that you follow, when flying to the target? or do you watch spotter's feed first, as they fly the mavic and scan for the orks, and you simply remember the route by remembering some landmarks?\n\n>A: Drones are anonymised during construction. There's a guidance system to assist pilots finding their targets.\n\n\u3164\n\n>Q: how does the drone procurement for units go in ZSU at the moment? if i understand correctly, it used to be 100% crowd funding right after orks started the full-scale war. there have been reports that command now puts focus on drone procurement by state. is this already happening? do you already feel the difference?\n\n>A: This is definitely happening, I've noticed a 300-400% increase in our shop alone.\n\n\u3164\n\n>Q: Some military analysts (michael koffman) say that at some point cheap drones are easy to jam and its turning out that quality is getting better than quantity. Can you say this is somewhat true? do you fear that at some point, all your dones will be easily jammed and you will have scaled production for nothing?\n\n>A: unless russia starts using true multiband reactive jammers across the entire front, swapping frequencies can go pretty far\n\n\u200e \n\n>Q: Any attempt to integrate AI control to circumvent EW?\n\n>A: some people are doing it\n\n>>Q: Full control for the entire flight or like a take over when the signal gets sketchy?\n\n>>A: from what I've seen the operator locks it on, similar to how spike LR works",

In addition, it's one of the quite few territorial defense brigades whose battalions are overwhelmingly concentrated in the same sector, holding a section of the front line as a stand-alone unit, which means it's large enough to do that and likewise has a decent sized HQ staff. \n\nIn February I [had written](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1arevz0/comment/kqjtz51), in addition to going through the history and the characteristics of the TDF, that there was a lot of talk on Ukrainian social media about a future reform of the branch and whether the best brigades could be reformed as brigades of the Ground Forces.\n\nThe decision to reform it as a mechanized brigade and not as an infantry brigade is very interesting, as it means having to equip the unit with some heavy armament such as tanks, IFVs/APCs and howitzers. A few days ago a 155mm Bohdana 2S22 had been in seen in service with the 100th TDF Brigade, and it would have been the only territorial defense brigade fielding howitzers, since the heavy fire support in these brigades is provided by 60/81/82mm mortars in the fire support companies of the battalions, with several brigades managing to acquire 120mm mortars during 2023 thanks to the \"Long Hands of TDF\" project. \n\nSo far, only several battalions had been created under the Ground Forces from existing territorial defense battalions: the 225th Separate Assault Battalion (formerly the 225th Battalion of the 127th TDF Brigade, an Azov-Kharkiv unit) and the 48th Separate Assault Battalion, on the basis of the 251st Battalion of the 241st TDF Brigade, which also includes the \"Norman Brigade\", a unit made up of foreign volunteers. In addition, the 98th Battalion of the 108th TDF Brigade (Azov-Dnipro) in early 2023 became the 1st Mech Battalion of the 3rd Assault Brigade; on the basis of DTFG \"Khartiia\" (which used to be part of the 127th TDF Brigade), the \"Khartiia\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard, under the National Guard, was raised. In addition, another Azov-Kharkiv unit, created on the basis of the 226th Battalion of the 127th TDF Brigade, became part of the Kraken Special Detachment of the HUR and was then reformed as the 97th Mech Battalion of the 60th Mechanized Brigade. \n\nSo, anyway, this is the first case of an entire territorial defense brigade being reformed. Most likely more will follow in the coming weeks or months. Let's recall that the TDF in general has been slowly but steadily being dismantled for a long time now and the number of its soldiers has been steadily declining since the peak of the summer/autumn 2022: it's based on volunteers on a territorial basis, practically receives little to no mobilized men; many of its servicemen were and are transferred to the Ground or Air Assault Forces, either on a voluntary basis (in the past - when many of its younger servicemen also joined the brigades of the Offensive Guard) or on a forcible one, as has been the case since late 2023. Probably the project of a complete reform of this branch accelerated with the appointment of Syrsky as Commander-in-Chief of the UAF (after all, he was the former commander of the Ground Forces and never a fan of the autonomy of the TDF); it's possible that this is part of a potential large reform of the structure of the armed forces.",

The Rada has legislation prepared & is ready to do so\". I thought there was a discussion that explicitly said that. The closest I found skimming through was \"The Russo-Ukrainian War at Two\", so maybe I am slightly conflating things\n\nI see a comment that the last census was done in 2001. I would guess there's no real way to judge the number of men left in Ukraine. I am not sure they had the bureaucratic capacity to do so, pre-invasion. I was going to suggest looking at the number of people who have left the country; but I'm not sure how transparent those figures are, and how you'd account for people in Russia/Central Asia/Caucasus etc. or who illegally left, or bribed/committed fraud to meet exemptions. The politico article mentioned yesterday cites the BBC's report that 650,000 fighting-aged males fled the country.\n\nThe only note I have is from June 2022, \"Zelensky responds negatively to petition to lift ban for men of 18-60 years old to leave Ukraine.Zelensky cited Article 17 of the Constitution, which says that defending the sovereignty of Ukraine is the responsibility of its people. He also referenced Article 64, that allows for the rights and liberties to be limited during the martial law, which has been in place since Feb. 24.\"\n\nI don't remember when it became official that males were not allowed to leave the country. It looks like Feb 24th.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom War on the Rocks:\n\n[The Russo-Ukrainian War at Two](https://youtu.be/3ZbnoLGB6WQ)\n\n12:25 \"(the demographic structure - far fewer men 20-30 than 40) ... very politically unpopular. ... 18:45 I get the sense that Zelensky understands he needs to do this, but he is not throwing his full political heft behind it. ... 20:17 directed bullying of people online who were critical of what they were doing (re Bahkmut)...\"\n21:45 need money/will hit the economy because you need to pay the conscripted men\n22:45 \"literally the most popular person in Ukraine (Zaluzhny)\"\n\n(I think this is the episode that also says that, while the law states 27, in practice, they were targeting >30 year olds)\n\n[Ukraine at War, From Avdiivka to Zaluzhny](https://youtu.be/2WItGo4Rzi4)\n\n13:50-16:00 mobilization discussion\n\n19:20 Zelensky is afraid of a political threat from Zalsuzhny\n\n[Fortifications, Manpower, and Munitions in Ukraine's Daunting Year Ahead](https://youtu.be/BKjVnXcdAuM)\n\n3:00\n5:30 more reference to Zaluzhny\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn short, a superficial summary of why the draft age has not been lowered below 27 yet:\n\n1) demographics of age distribution\n\n2) claims that they don't have the funding to train them / they want to make sure they get foreign aid before drafting a large number of people (I don't see how this holds any water. It's been 2 years. You're fighting Russia in a clearly existential threat from day 0. Men should've been trained in 2021, if not 2014. Maybe they were concerned with a domestic threat?).

I\u2019m not talking about a whole front collapse with the return of all lands to Ukraine or a Russian civil war or that sort of stuff.\nBased on all the data gathered Russia seems to have key problems in certain areas:\n- Tanks, SPGs and IFVs. Although Russia is still producing such weaponry, it is obvious from satellite footage of Russian bases that stockpiles are decreasing. Some great OSINT detectives count the number of vehicles at army (storage) bases throughout Russia and this gives an interesting insight in what Russia can still deliver on short notice. Furthermore, based on loss data, we can see some interesting patterns in which certain vehicle types become more rare. Or that the MTLBs are used more and more, or T6x/T5x as assault vehicles. Ofc one could say Russia is holding back for a future offensive (some say Kupyansk/Kharkiv in the summer) but we have seen during Avdiivka that Russia will suffer major losses during such offensive.\n- Manpower. I don\u2019t think the number is the issue for Russia.

I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. They very much increased their defense budget to more than 7% of their GDP. It is unknown how they are going to pay for this, but it is suggested that taxes will increase.

Putin can try to invest more reserves to counter the inflation or try to keep the energyprices stable, but this will ofc be pulled from their financial reserves or increasing the debt.\n\nI think Putin is wary of the above, hence their all in at the frontline. Some reports say that Putin wants to give Kharkiv another go to create a bufferzone at the border and end the war after that.\nThe thing is, as long as the manpower pool of Ukraine is stable (or even increasing), Western support is stable (or even increasing.
