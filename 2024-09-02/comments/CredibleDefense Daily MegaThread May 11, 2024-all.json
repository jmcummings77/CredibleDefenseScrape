The city is encircled by the RSF, and diplomats fear it is on the \u201cprecipice of a large-scale massacre\u201d.\n\nFor perspective, the [UN](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ethnic-killings-one-sudan-city-left-up-15000-dead-un-report-2024-01-19/) estimates that up to 15,000 were killed just in El Geneina, a city with a population of ~540k. The UAE and Russia have been two external props boosting the Janjaweed and RSF. Reuters, amongst others such as the WSJ, had an excellent reporting series, documenting the atrocities in Sudan, with some historical background of the situation, highly encouraged reading:\n\n[1](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/sudan-politics-darfur/)\n\n[2](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/sudan-politics-darfur-attacks/)\n\n[3](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/sudan-politics-darfur-males/)\n\nAt present, the city of El Fasher is in the crosshairs of the RSF. The [UN](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/attack-el-fasher-would-endanger-hundreds-thousands-children-warns-unicef) spells out what\u2019s at stake:\n\n> The increase of fighting in Sudan\u2019s North Darfur state has taken a deadly toll on children in recent weeks. But the threat of an imminent military attack on El Fasher, a city sheltering at least 500,000 people displaced by violence elsewhere in the country, risks a catastrophic escalation, endangering the lives and wellbeing of 750,000 children in El Fasher, and potentially millions more. \n\nFurther, beyond the catastrophic situation on the humanitarian front,\nCSIS has a [stark](https://www.csis.org/analysis/preventing-another-darfur-genocide) warning for the potential fallout: \n\n\n> Importantly, the upcoming fight for El Fasher promises to unleash a new tribal element to the conflict, pitting the Arab-dominated RSF forces against the mainly the Fur and Zaghawa tribes in the city who are aligned with the SAF. The threat of the city falling is already beginning to draw in militia and tribal fighters from around the region. This influx of fighters will likely make this the largest and bloodiest battle of the war to date and could well transform this conventional conflict into a more factionalized, tribal-based war with immediate ripple effects well beyond Sudan\u2019s borders.\n\n> Assuming the taking of El Fasher by the RSF, that victory would complete the militia\u2019s takeover of all five of Darfur\u2019s states, giving it total control of nearly one-third of the country, including Sudan\u2019s international borders with Libya, Chad, and Central African Republic. From this position, the RSF could levy taxes and customs duties, control the majority of Sudan\u2019s trade in gold and other minerals, and facilitate human, drug, and arms smuggling across a vast territory. These revenue streams and territorial control would further cement the RSF as a rival to any central authority, making a negotiated political settlement that much harder to achieve. In the meantime, millions of civilians living under RSF control would be put at grave risk given the militia\u2019s well documented history of atrocity crimes.\n\nIn neighboring relatively peaceful and placid Chad, which could well be drawn into the conflict, Deby just won the [election](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz96ezdljl9o). While he has been on the RSF\u2019s side for much of the conflict, he and his fellow military leadership are ethnic Zaghawa, one of the groups being massacred by the RSF, which could lead to him throwing in with the SAF. If that were to happen, the conflict *could* expand quickly beyond the borders of Sudan.",

As a result, Ukraine isn&#39;t leaps and bounds ahead; instead, they&#39;re embroiled in a war that they might still lose.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cultural separation, a term spread and used by Russian propaganda, is not what happened, but it was\u00a0<em>regaining</em>\u00a0independence. Russia spent centuries subjugating Ukraine and deleting its culture and heritage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where did I argue that Ukraine didn&#39;t have its own culture? There was undoubtedly a significant overlap with Russia, including shared influences in music, television, and other aspects of pop culture, which predominantly originated from Russia. Additionally, Russian was the predominant language spoken in nearly all major cities, except Lviv.</p>\n\n<p>This dynamic began to shift, especially after 2022. You might choose not to call it cultural separation, but regardless of the term used, it doesn&#39;t alter the essence of my initial argument. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course separation from Russia was the main goal, what do you think why people were waiving EU flags?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://maidanmuseum.org/node/668\">Five years on, in 2018, while some people listed the separation from Russia as a positive outcome, it didn\u2019t even rank in the top five benefits perceived from the Maidan movement.

Not only does it involve some mechanized support, there's been numerous photos of dozens (or even a hundred) of Russian soldiers staging and marching in broad daylight.  \n\nThey crossed the border at some point.  While Ukraine has the ISR to take videos of them, apparently, they don't have the fires to do anything about it.  FPVs are hitting infantry and vehicles occasionally but thus far it seems like these Russian marches between villages are successfully getting inside those villages.\n\nOnce inside, these villages probably either contain no Ukrainians, or squad/platoon level groups.  Either way, in no way enough to defend against the much larger Russian numbers that are successfully marching into the villages.  \n\nIn practice, that means Russians will continue advancing until the numeric ratios change.

The piece is about a reported blow up between Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. Specifically it has the latter telling Netanyahu that because he refuses to make diplomatic arrangements for post-war government of Gaza the IDF is having to go back to fight again in areas it already took over. In some cases they\u2019re having to go back and fight for the same ground a third time!\n\n> (Here\u2019s another article in Haaretz (sub req) on how the IDF is now going back into northern Gaza, which they conquered back in the fall. Privately the IDF says Hamas has reestablished control there because there\u2019s no day after plan, which is a diplomatic to-do item. If you blow it up and leave why wouldn\u2019t they just go back?)\n\n> Netanyahu refuses to do that because there\u2019s really no way to so without blowing up his governing coalition. But without some plan, the Israeli army is reduced to doing something like pushing water up a hill with its hands. The article is replete with examples of heads of the army or intelligence services trying to get someone to give them a strategy, or actually more than a strategy, just a goal. And it has Netanyahu getting mad because they\u2019re going to the Defense Minister, himself a former high level IDF general. It\u2019s not even a question of disagreeing on strategy really \u2013 that\u2019s for the political leadership to decide. It\u2019s refusing to come up with any strategy at all.\n\n>The simple fact is that Netanyahu has waged an unimaginably destructive war with a massive loss of life and managed to accomplish much less than Israel could have if they\u2019d had a clear strategy of what they were trying to do, or specifically who would rule Gaza after Hamas had been displaced. Some of this goes beyond Netanyahu\u2019s failings as a leader. The war launched in a climate of unparalleled outrage over the October 7th massacres with what were probably unrealistic objectives \u2013 destroying Hamas\u2019s military capacity in toto, killing or capturing the soldiers, eliminating the weaponry and rocket capacity as well as the critical tunnel infrastructure. But that was a long time ago, seven months ago.\n\n> I hear often people saying that Netanyahu is just continuing the war indefinitely because that\u2019s the only way he can stay in power. In practice, it amounts to that. But I think to capture his full folly and failure as a leader you have to go a bit deeper. He\u2019s fighting the best war as he can \u2013 but only within the bounds of what his coalition will allow. Which essentially means fighting with no strategy. And what that means for the IDF is just keep chasing Hamas around and killing Hamas soldiers, or rooting them out from parts of the Strip. So the IDF roots them out and then they leave and then a month later Hamas fighters filter back in and you\u2019re back to where you were in the first place, only now all the buildings are destroyed and lots and lots of civilians are dead. So again, massive destruction and loss of life and not that much even accomplished.\n\n>Again, it\u2019s like trying to push water up a hill with your hands. This anger within the Israeli military at a total lack of goals or strategy has been bubbling for months. I also suspect this is the real reason for the refusal to supply weaponry for an assault on Rafah. As I noted in an earlier post, I\u2019ve picked up through hints in the Israeli press and other ways that there is real misgivings about such an assault within the Israeli national security echelon itself. I suspect largely because it\u2019s just a much bigger and deadlier version of the chasing folly unless there\u2019s a clear strategy for what happens after its done. And there is no strategy.",

There is no equivalent to the Houtis, Hezbollah, Iraqi Shia militias.\n\nAgain, more threat inflation. Israel has by far the strongest military in the region and the absolute backing of the world's most powerful country - the fact you're trying to equate it with a few ragtag militias and Iran is a joke. Your sense of the balance of power is completely lopsided. Israel's weakness is not in military terms, but in the political and diplomatic arena, which is why the Palestinian cause and Iran and its proxies are targeting that axis.

Plus any strings attached.</p>\n\n<p>Also a fair point. Money spent on US arms can\u2019t be spent elsewhere, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude them from getting arms elsewhere. I would be interested in seeing what \u201cstrings attached\u201d have been implemented in previous deals if this nature where it seems to not be in the interest of a close US ally. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014 First: defense equipment and services refers to any war items. It&#39;s the common term for it. This sub is even called CredibleDefense when it doesn&#39;t only deal with defensive, not offensive topics.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize, I messed your comment as \u201cdefensive\u201d equipment which I interpreted as the waiver applying to only non-offensive equipment. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Second: there isn&#39;t anything listed on any site about what types of services these are. That could be because there are no items listed in the letter, or because the outlets are biased and not releasing the information because of their own spin.</p>\n\n<p>I have been unable to find the letter myself but I can imagine that specifics weren\u2019t listed out as it was a letter of intent sent to congress, not finalized rendition of the waiver.</p>\n</div>",

I agree with all that. \n\nBut one thing I think these analysis miss is cost of doing nothing or cost of limited campaign against Hamas.\n If Israel doesn't go all out against Hamas and then surely there would be eventual Ceasirfire which would see release of tens of thousands Palestinians locked in Israeli jail, many of which who committed grave crimes.\n\n Israel has released a thousand prisoners including Hamas current chief in exchange of one soldier, now here we are talking about 200 hostages. \n\nAlso Hamas would still be in power and their net gain would be positive. In this scenario of limited campaign by IDF, there would be more freed Palestinians from Israeli jails than dead Palestinians by Israeli retaliation\nVast majority of tunnels would still be intact. Palestinian society would even be more receptive of arm struggle against Israel.\n Hamas would be way way more popular. Voices from Palestinian side who supports diplomatic and non violent approach would be even more sidelined.\n\n Future Hamas leadership here would demand more than 2 state solution, for example right of return which Israel would not accept. \n\nWhich would encourage Hamas to launch similar attack in Israel in near future. \n\nBut more than these, Hezbollah would be way more confident in attacking Israel. Hezbollah as a force is way way more powerful than Hamas. Hezbollah can make life for Israelis truly hell in case of all out war due to them having hundreds of thousands of missile and rockets.\n If Hezbollah see Hamas ( a very less powerful force) not only getting away but acheiving it's objectives after launching worst attack on Israeli then surely they would not shy away from launching similar attacks on Israel. \nOnly reason Israel had quiet border with Lebanon is due to Israel badly damaging the country in its war with Hezbollah in 2006.\n\nHezbollah chief himself agreed that if he had known that Israel would react this way then he would not have started the war. \n\nShow of force is very important factor in middle East, thats why iran launched such a big attack recently. \n\nThere is no compentent military that threatens Israeli existence right now.
