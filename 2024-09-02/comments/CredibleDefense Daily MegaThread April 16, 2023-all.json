Ukraine doesn\u2019t have the manpower and firepower to actually inflict real damage on the Russian state.\n\nAlso I find it illogical to discount their capabilities  in producing munitions.

        "body": "# Sudan conflict - recent events\n\nCan anyone provide additional context for the recent activity that kicked off in Sudan?\n\nHere's my understanding for what's going on so far:\n\nThere are currently two main groups involved, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese army. The RSF was a paramilitary organization that originally apart of the Sudanese Armed Forces. It's currently led by General Hamdan Dagalo (Hemetti) who was also involved in the 2019 Sudan coup. Both groups recently clashed, starting on 15 April 2023, with reports of dozens killed. There are  combat videos floating around that show combatants engaging in live fire. Most reports reports state that the RSF has sized control of various strategic and political areas throughout Sudan (airports, presidential palace, etc)\n\n**Questions for the crowd:**\n\n* Are just the RSF and SAF involved, are there other factions or sub-factions apart of this?\n* Is there a clear motive yet?

It was relatively low intensity, lasted a month, and was settled diplomatically. There are currently no serious boiling territorial disputes on the continent. Argentina is still sore about the Falkland Islands, to the point that they don't even recognize Kosovo because it would complicate their claims there, but everyone is aware that they aren't capable or aiming to try again. And that's between a non-latam nation as well. \n\nThere are no arms races either, except for defence ministers competing with their own ego. I am highly critical of LatAm military procurement. I am Peruvian, we operate 5 outdated, (though updated) submarines. They are completely impotent militarily. They are outfitted with torpedos from the 1950s. We do not have any guided missiles. Submarines fulfill no practical role in Peruvian security, even if they were modern. I remember reading some document published *by* the Peruvian Navy, and I'm recalling from memory and translating, but the document literally said that *\"By procuring these submarines, the Peruvian Navy finally fulfills the vision of General Grau of deploying a formidable naval force in the pacific\".* \n\n[General Grau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Grau_Seminario) was an admiral and cultural hero who died 150 years ago. All this naval budget is spent on pointless assets because a respected but long dead naval hero wanted a strong navy. There is basically no analytical or practical approach to national security, so it's good thing the continent is fairly peaceful. My neighbor is Brazilian and he tells me it's worse there, domestically developing cruise missiles and tanks and other highly expensive gear, and there is growing talk of procuring nuclear subs. And against which foe? In his opinion, the only objective of a Latin American military is to justify itself by trying to grow stronger than they need to be, with a minor secondary goal of social spending. I'm not sure if I'm that cynical, but like most things involving Latin American governments, there's not a lot of logic. Here, the only threats to peace come from within.",

This is less true for advanced things like drones or artillery, but they could give everyone basic infantry kit.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is - people running Russia do not <strong>want</strong> to simply pay and supply the troops, as doing so would dramatically reduce corruption opportunities, and corruption is their source of income and power. When everyone is trying to get their cut, then naturally not everything reaches the soldiers.

But for NW Europe this is seen as existential. Russia is not abstract geopolitics but their long term survival as independent states. They also generally have a much dimmer view of Communism than some of the more liberal and social democratic elements of Europe. \n\nThe US public may see this as making this a proxy war between the US and China so this might change centre right opinion to be much more hostile to Russia. It may push an impetus for the US to stop relying on consensus on weapons and start seeing this as something that needs shut down quickly even if it bruises egos in Paris and Berlin. \n\nIts like throwing a spark onto dry tinder. It may not ignite. It might be frustration in Warsaw and Helsinki but Berlin being too concerned with VW sales to bend to their concerns. It may be a fire that pushes Europe into shutting this down \"by any means necessary\" and allowing ATACMs and shifting the money donated way up.\n\nThis makes it unpredictable.

But the Russian army, aware of the risk, has already prepared serried lines of defences in the region.  \n>  \n>The Russian defences typically consist of a minefield, followed by lines of pyramid-shaped concrete bollards called dragons\u2019 teeth that slow down mechanised units.
