Roughly:\n\nIts radar is not great, small aperture will have difficulty on BVR out to the kind of ranges needed, not great picking out small targets at low level. But will have a much better EW suit and all round situation awareness, does not mention the issues they will have with GBAD especially the large group of new gun systems. \n\nTalks about the two training pipelines, one for veterans who will be wedded to the structured ground directed systems of old and one for those who will train from new on the pilot centric western style the F-16 is optimised for. But does stress it will take a lot of time for them to get up to speed on being 2 ship lead, 4 ship lead then onto weapons instructor level that you need to be a modern western air force. \n\nStrongly emphasise the lack of pilots is the key choke point. That and the lack of technically proficient English speakers, everything in Ukraine needs them. \n\nDoes cover weapons and give a good physics explanation on how being so low in the warm and soupy lower troposphere murders your fuel consumption and really really hurts the range of missiles. Suggests you might burn 5 times as much fuel down there but you need to be down there to avoid S-3/400 etc. \n\nMy guy is still not happy that Gripen was not prioritised, was the maximal capability for the human resource available. Better radar, better operational flexibility. I suspect lower radar cross section is part of it. \n\nNot covered in this interview but in another he mentioned one of the unexpected issues with using guns on Shaheed is they blow up and your moving so fast your suddenly in a debris field. This has been an  issue the Ukrainians have found on their Migs but I understand also the RAF/USAF intercept of the Iranian attack. \"Nothing new under the Sun\" this was a problem the original drone killers had, Air Defence Great Britain interceptors on the V-1s.

We wouldn't be jumping into this blind like a lot of those ground volunteers did.\n\n3) Your Ukrainian wingman is not a Western-trained wingman who has grown up in Western flight school. When Sen. Mark Kelly [shat all over Russian pilots for not being able to fly formation](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-kelly-russian-jets-us-drone-incident-shows-pilot-incompetence-2023-3) - guess who taught the senior Ukrainian pilots?

Again, we know our systems and our capabilities - they clearly don't (although it's funny how seeing F-16s get fielded and they've done a lot to temper expectations... guess they found out too)\n\n4) Western fighters go into combat with a TON of support. Intelligence and ISR. Special mission platforms like Rivet Joints, Compass Call, Growlers, and AWACS/E-2s - all things Ukraine has exactly ZERO of.

And the military would rather anyone who got out recently to stay close to the US in case we ever needed to pull from more than our reserves. And then you need to consider the massive pilot retention problems in the DOD (where we're offering $50k+ bonuses per year just to try and retain people from getting out). People get out to go fly the friendly skies to make money and be free from deployments and military life - and you don't become a pilot by being insane.",

        "body": "So there has been a lot of conversation in recent threads on the [pause on Air Force NGAD](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/07/air-force-taking-a-pause-on-ngad-next-gen-fighter-kendall/) and the [Navy cutting funding on its own NGAD program](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/navys-fa-xx-6th-generation-fighter-might-get-90-cut-funding-211926)\n\nWhile there\u2019s good discussion about requirements changes and all that, what I think everyone is missing in all this is WHY this discussion is happening today \u2013 and all at the same time. **And that after years of people warning about budget shortfalls, that day has actually come \u2013 right when the bill for a lot of things is due.**\n\nTo start with, most people here probably haven\u2019t paid much attention to the impact of the [Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-fiscal-responsibility-act-2023-means-defense-spending) (FRA) which caps the overall defense budget (DoD + defense-related DoE) and significantly cuts increases afterwards:\n\n> The spending caps for FY 2025 for both defense and non-defense programs are one percent higher than the FY 2024 topline limits in nominal terms. However, adjusted for inflation, defense funding would fall by 1 percent from FY 2024 to FY 2025 with funding capped at approximately $895 billion. The Biden administration had originally projected that defense spending would remain flat with inflation from FY 2024 to FY 2025.\n\nOf note, the DoD [did actually submit a budget request in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3703410/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2025-defense-budget/). For those who don\u2019t know how defense budgeting works: it flows from the bottom up. Each component of each branch submits requests for how much money it needs to meet that branch\u2019s objectives, and each branch submits its budget requests that go into Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)\u2019s budget books that get submitted eventually to Congress. \n\nSo at the top level of each branch (Secretaries of the Army, Air Force, and Navy), they have to adjudicate funding conflicts and make hard choices on how to keep within their allotted budget.\n\nOf note, however, the FRA sets a VERY firm limit driven by Congress itself, whereas in years past, you could describe the defense budget request as more \u2018squishy\u2019 with Congress happy to add tens of billions on top of what was requested.\n\nFor example, the DoD has \u2013 by law (believe it or not) \u2013 provided an annual list of \u2018unfunded priorities\u2019 to Congress, which Congressmen have often used as a reason to throw money to on top of the DoD\u2019s own budget request. There is, however, a bipartisan effort [to eliminate unfunded priorities entirely](https://www.pogo.org/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-the-problem-with-unfunded-priorities-lists) under H.R. 4740 and S.5255:\n\n> In the House, Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Tom McClintock (R-CA), John Garamendi (D-CA), Warren Davidson (R-OH), and Seth Moulton (D-MA) have introduced the Streamline Pentagon Budgeting Act (H.R. 4740) to repeal the requirement to submit UPLs for top military officers, combatant commanders, the Missile Defense Agency, and the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\n>A Senate version of the Streamline Pentagon Budgeting Act (S. 5255) was introduced in the 117th Congress by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Angus King (I-ME)\n\nThe tone has changed. [Of note, the House Appropriations bill](https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-passes-fy25-defense-appropriations-act-bolstering-military-capabilities) (what actually decides where money goes) was passed by the House at EXACTLY the limit at which the FRA required.\n\nNote too, [the Senate Armed Services Committee](https://www.twz.com/air/navys-f-a-xx-next-generation-fighter-program-would-be-gutted-under-senate-defense-bill) wanted to break the spending cap by $25B above the FRA, while cutting $400M from the Navy\u2019s own requested money for their NGAD, in favor of adding money towards another submarine.\n\nHowever, the Senate Appropriations Committee [broke the spending cap by $21B](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/08/sac-passes-852b-defense-bill-breaking-budget-caps-and-teeing-up-budget-fight/) \u2013 $4B less than what the SASC proposed - which included a third Burke class but less funding for a second submarine. Surprising a lot of people, they also *increased* Navy NGAD funding by $500M. \n\nFor reference, Congress ROUTINELY increased the DoD budget over what was requested in past decades\u2026 we\u2019re talking $30-50B above $500-700B, so $21-25B over $850B is quite small. As an example, in 2017, the FY2018 budget request was $639B. The final Congress passed budget? $696B! \n\nUltimately, we will see what happens, since the House Act and the proposed SASC and SAC bills all differ (and Senate still has to vote) \u2013 and that has to go through reconciliation. But the fact that Congress is fighting over whether or not to break the FRA they set, and part of Congress is being very strict about adhering to it, is casting a shadow over the free-flowing money the DoD once had \n\nImpact is that at the Secretary level, every program you need money for means you must take money away from somewhere else. There is now outright resistance from Congress from giving you things just because you deem it critical. And the days of Congress adding money to fix your cuts is no longer guaranteed.\n\nFor the Air Force, the Sentinel ICBM program, which incurred a Nunn-McCurdy breach, [is projected to cost 81% more than planned](https://www.stripes.com/branches/air_force/2024-07-08/sentinel%C2%A0icbm-minuteman-cost-overrun-nuclear-14424456.html). The Air Force has also referenced the B-21 as being a priority.\n\nSo two legs of the nuclear triad \u2013 one of which is getting a significant increase in projected costs \u2013 in a fiscally tight environment that Congress is actually trying to adhere to unlike in past years? (Of note, on the Navy side, the bill for the Columbia class is also coming due)\n\nAnd before people go: \u201cBut wait, air superiority core of the DoD\u201d \u2013 first, not true for the entire DoD (the Army, for instance, does not necessarily plan with that assumption). Also, remember: what critical to national *security* is not the same as what is critical to national *survival*. You can struggle with air superiority can still eventually win a war - but not having a credible nuclear deterrence may result in defeat before you've even fought.\n\nExplains why [the Air Force is taking a more risk-adverse tone](https://defensescoop.com/2024/06/13/gen-david-allvin-ngad-fighter-jet-hedges-commitment/) regarding expensive and exquisite platforms now:\n\n> As the service evaluates how it executes on its various modernization efforts, Allvin emphasized the importance of not putting \u201ca lot of eggs in one basket\u201d and being unable to adapt to new threats going forward. He said the service is taking the initiative to pursue human-machine teaming technologies and other capabilities that are adaptable to changing military environments as a method to mitigate some of those risks.\n\n>\u201c\u2019Built to last\u2019 is a tremendous 20th century bumper sticker. But the assumption was, whatever you had was relevant as long as it lasted. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s relevant anymore,\u201d Allvin said. \"In 10 years after this, I\u2019m hoping the technology will make it so that CCA won\u2019t be as relevant, but it might be adaptable... It is going to be a challenging next couple of years to sort out the resources.\"\n\nThere just isn\u2019t the wiggle room anymore to spend a decade-plus correcting deficiencies in under-performing/late programs.\n\nI should note that LIFE CYCLE costs are a big part of this. Whenever a program of record is established, the entire life cycle of the program \u2013 from R&D through procurement through operations & maintenance through disposal \u2013 must be estimated. So it\u2019s not just an eye-popping upfront price that is an issue \u2013 it\u2019s the operations and maintenance/sustainment of the program (which historically is 65-80%+ of a total life cycle cost) that is an issue. \n\nA cheap up-front price tag, but excessive operating costs, means you are robbing your future as that money is due in years you are looking to spend on future systems (this is why the Air Force has complained repeatedly about the F-35A\u2019s operating costs being way above what was estimated\u2026 there\u2019s no way they can come close to actually buying the program of record with those costs and still be able to spend money elsewhere in the future)\n\nI\u2019ll also note that this is why the DOD and White House [have resisted](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/pay-raise-junior-enlisted-white-house-cbo-estimates/)the massive junior enlisted pay increase that parts of Congress has proposed: Congress has set a budgetary cap, but is increasing pay for junior enlisted. So what part of the budget are they taking away from to make that pay bump happen?\n\nI have a lot of personal disagreements with the pay increase requirements and WHY some in Congress are proposing it (imo, it\u2019s just more politicizing of the military), but that\u2019s for another thread.\n\nPersonally? I can feel a gloom has been cast over things this past year with the confluence of the fact that the free-spending days are over \u2013 eliminating the small respite from Congress always being late to pass the budget \u2013 requiring everyone to rethink priorities and make sure program requirements are really hitting what you need going forward (a good thing), which unfortunately can lead to over-analysis, risk aversion, and organizational paralysis (a bad thing). All with an atrophied defense-industrial base (a bad thing) that struggles to deliver what is promised in a relevant timeline (a bad thing), which makes bad acquisitions decisions all that more painful (which is in a feedback loop with the risk-aversion and organizational paralysis).",

                "body": "Anecdotally, if you polled a bunch of active duty dudes who have done a stint at the Pentagon or through various program offices, I think you'd find a lot of them would say that there are a lot (way too many, as some would say) of random civilians and contractors who have stuck around with way too much power (because they can't get fired easily, and they can simply outlast their active duty counterparts who get rotated every 2-3 years).\n\nSome very senior officers have told me that there used to be a much larger presence of active duty personnel in the Pentagon and at various program offices, but that's petered out over the years. \n\nRemember, Congress sets service-member personnel numbers, so with a finite # of active duty, the branches prioritize people to fill operational forces due to the high OPTEMPO environment post 9/11 (few will disagree that we simply aren't at the right size in #s or equipment for the demands). \n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: we drew down our active duty numbers from the end of the Cold War with [no real increase in the GWOT years](https://historyinpieces.com/research/us-military-personnel-1954-2014) despite an OPTEMPO higher than anything in the 90s and even during the Cold War.\n\nThis has resulted in a HUGE reliance on civilians - but government civilians are also capped by Congress, so the end result? The branches have relied more heavily than ever on contractors. Thus you have your contractor types from the Deloittes and Booz Allen Hamiltons and what not running around DC doing all of what you mentioned.\n\nThe population growth in NoVA post 9/11 - with tons of high paying government contracts abound - is precisely why NoVA is what it is today. \n\n>I don't doubt that topline funding is an issue, but IMO its also true that an enormous amount of money goes out to people, projects, and companies who are operating with no urgency and are providing limited real capabilities. And we seem to have no interest or ability to address or reform the system.\n\nAs u/this_shit mentioned, top-down funding constraints are supposed to squeeze out the bloat, but in practice, this doesn't really happen. Why is that?\n\nWell, see my blurb about DOD budgeting being from the bottom-up.\n\nNow, I'm sure you've heard of when people talk about \"use it or lose it\" funding\n\nThey are intertwined: when it comes to requesting money for the next budget cycle, you have to justify why you need that money. So if you don't use that money, it's harder to justify getting that same money next year\n\nAcross the entire DoD, at a certain tier in the chain of command, that budgeting is done and rolled up until it gets into the Secretary level, which then gets rolled into the OSD level.\n\nSo let's say you're the Navy's Strike Fighter Wing Pacific administratively in charge of all the F/A-18E/F squadrons on the West Coast + Japan. You will request X # of flight hours - to be divided up amongst the squadrons - for the next budget. To justify this, you want your squadrons to actually execute said flight hours, or else people will see \"hey, you only flew 80,000 of your 100,000 allocated hours, why should I believe you need 100,000 next year?\"\n\nSee where the issue starts becoming a problem when you start talking acquisitions (you will spend money to protect your funding, even if said program is failing)? \n\nAnd see how easy it can be to end up in a political pissing match as each program office or branch starts fighting to protect their fiefdom? \n\nWhen your job and livelihood exist because of your program or component or whatever, people often quickly close ranks and do whatever they can to justify their program's existence, making it extremely hard to kill things - or even reform them. \n\nI **wish** there was a central entity in the DoD that controlled everything, but alas, that doesn't exist.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Anecdotally, if you polled a bunch of active duty dudes who have done a stint at the Pentagon or through various program offices, I think you&#39;d find a lot of them would say that there are a lot (way too many, as some would say) of random civilians and contractors who have stuck around with way too much power (because they can&#39;t get fired easily, and they can simply outlast their active duty counterparts who get rotated every 2-3 years).</p>\n\n<p>Some very senior officers have told me that there used to be a much larger presence of active duty personnel in the Pentagon and at various program offices, but that&#39;s petered out over the years. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, Congress sets service-member personnel numbers, so with a finite # of active duty, the branches prioritize people to fill operational forces due to the high OPTEMPO environment post 9/11 (few will disagree that we simply aren&#39;t at the right size in #s or equipment for the demands). </p>\n\n<p>The numbers speak for themselves: we drew down our active duty numbers from the end of the Cold War with <a href=\"https://historyinpieces.com/research/us-military-personnel-1954-2014\">no real increase in the GWOT years</a> despite an OPTEMPO higher than anything in the 90s and even during the Cold War.</p>\n\n<p>This has resulted in a HUGE reliance on civilians - but government civilians are also capped by Congress, so the end result? The branches have relied more heavily than ever on contractors. Thus you have your contractor types from the Deloittes and Booz Allen Hamiltons and what not running around DC doing all of what you mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>The population growth in NoVA post 9/11 - with tons of high paying government contracts abound - is precisely why NoVA is what it is today. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t doubt that topline funding is an issue, but IMO its also true that an enormous amount of money goes out to people, projects, and companies who are operating with no urgency and are providing limited real capabilities. And we seem to have no interest or ability to address or reform the system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"/u/this_shit\">u/this_shit</a> mentioned, top-down funding constraints are supposed to squeeze out the bloat, but in practice, this doesn&#39;t really happen. Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Well, see my blurb about DOD budgeting being from the bottom-up.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of when people talk about &quot;use it or lose it&quot; funding</p>\n\n<p>They are intertwined: when it comes to requesting money for the next budget cycle, you have to justify why you need that money. So if you don&#39;t use that money, it&#39;s harder to justify getting that same money next year</p>\n\n<p>Across the entire DoD, at a certain tier in the chain of command, that budgeting is done and rolled up until it gets into the Secretary level, which then gets rolled into the OSD level.</p>\n\n<p>So let&#39;s say you&#39;re the Navy&#39;s Strike Fighter Wing Pacific administratively in charge of all the F/A-18E/F squadrons on the West Coast + Japan. You will request X # of flight hours - to be divided up amongst the squadrons - for the next budget. To justify this, you want your squadrons to actually execute said flight hours, or else people will see &quot;hey, you only flew 80,000 of your 100,000 allocated hours, why should I believe you need 100,000 next year?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>See where the issue starts becoming a problem when you start talking acquisitions (you will spend money to protect your funding, even if said program is failing)? </p>\n\n<p>And see how easy it can be to end up in a political pissing match as each program office or branch starts fighting to protect their fiefdom? </p>\n\n<p>When your job and livelihood exist because of your program or component or whatever, people often quickly close ranks and do whatever they can to justify their program&#39;s existence, making it extremely hard to kill things - or even reform them. </p>\n\n<p>I <strong>wish</strong> there was a central entity in the DoD that controlled everything, but alas, that doesn&#39;t exist.

It\u2019s certainly not a vote winning policy, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nAll in all, the USN is certainly not in the best position and short of contracting shipbuilding out, things won\u2019t improve very much and the USN will see a continual decline in its relative strength throughout this decade and the next.

China\u2019s stealth capabilities broadly are still behind that of the US\u2019 and while this could equalise out, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. The only issue is that it\u2019s not about platform capability in the Pacific. The one defining trait about the Pacific is distance and the inherent advantage that China enjoys simply due to proximity are exponential.

Very few military commentators will claim otherwise. The US will need to decide if it will accept this gracefully, trying to gain a few concessions from the Chinese in the process, or not. There is no alternative here. China will not be the underdog in their own backyard and the US will need to contend with the fact that, for the first time since its scuffle with the old European colonial powers, it will have to accept its status as the underdog, at least in the Pacific.\n\nThe issue is also cultural. Procurement in the US is terrible because the US throughout its modern history has always been able to go for gold-plated solutions. I don\u2019t think this cultural predisposition in the DoD is set to change any time soon.\n\nIf I had to place bets, I\u2019d place my bets on things continuing as they are for the foreseeable future.
