Better, but you\u2019re still misunderstanding the paper, the business and, MOST importantly, my point. I was trying to show you that analysts get things wrong all the time all by themselves. The fact that the media was not involved in it was <strong>precisely</strong> the point. Slightly different incentives, but the rating agencies, especially Moody\u2019s, going into the financial crisis, is another good example. They\u2019re examples of group think and crowding that analysts face. You\u2019re blaming the media for that, when the media has nothing to do with it.</p>\n</div>",

What's more likely is a nuanced position somewhere in the middle: there are natural bottlenecks in tubes and artillery pieces that are harder to replace, and thus you'd want a higher stockpile of.

They are not chocking off their own supplies etc, they also have limits on stock and flow. \n\nIt is not that incredible that Bidens advisors do not think that expending twice the artillery will have twice the impact, the battle space has changed, the over exposed regions around Kharkiv and Kherson have been recaptured and Russia now has Marine Infantry and VDV to act as an in theatre operational reserve. There is also a limit to the rate you can fire through the small number of 155mm tubes without needing constant relining. \n\nThere are very good reasons Biden will want this war over quick, Europe is headed into a cold winter with serious energy constraints so lots of victories in Ukraine would be politically invaluable. \n\nSo in terms of artillery ammunition I think they may have to think about multiple contingencies including not have Ukraine shoot out their barrels or use up US stocks for little effect in winter. \n\nIn terms of the other weapon systems, these have been long term positions that seem to be aligned with Germany and France. \n\nThere are many people with big stakes in this beyond Washington insiders and Ukraine. \n\nI can see a lot of reasons before I start buying into ideas they dont want Ukraine to win.",

Really the only reason to buy AMOS is to replace a large number of traditional 120mm mortars with a small number of AMOSes and thus cut few dozen soldiers from the army per vehicle procured. If the personnel costs are high, this should be a very atractive option. \n\nBTW AMOS is a Finnish weapon system. Originally it was developed together with Sweden, but Swedes dropped out of the program due to some technical difficulties and defence cuts. Finland got the program to its goal alone after that and is the only operator of the system. And the reason it is so rare is that we have no need for it. Manning a 12 tube company of 120mm mortars is no problem with universal conscription so there is little need for us to waste money on these superweapons.",

You can get a modern 155mm SPG with a similar price so if money is the limiting factor of your military power, there is little reason to buy them. Really the only reason to buy AMOS is to replace a large number of traditional 120mm mortars with a small number of AMOSes and thus cut few dozen soldiers from the army per vehicle procured. If the personnel costs are high, this should be a very atractive option. </p>\n\n<p>BTW AMOS is a Finnish weapon system. Originally it was developed together with Sweden, but Swedes dropped out of the program due to some technical difficulties and defence cuts. Finland got the program to its goal alone after that and is the only operator of the system. And the reason it is so rare is that we have no need for it. Manning a 12 tube company of 120mm mortars is no problem with universal conscription so there is little need for us to waste money on these superweapons.</p>\n</div>",

These platforms seem like their geared to missile defense in a low intensity environment. I am skeptical of the idea of trying to link point defense systems to one central radar and operate them like a SAM site. And the cost does seem way out of proportion to the cost of drones, tbh I'm not sure even if it would make economic sense using these against missiles. But then this also doesn't seem to me to be a tailor made solution, rather its Rheinmetall repurposing some legacy GWOT tech they were trying to sell anyway.

We see the same deterrent dynamic that characterized the Cold War play out in Ukraine. The West is afraid of supporting Ukraine too much, does not want Ukraine to overtly attack Russian soil, and Russia in turn does not try to attack Ukraine\u2019s western backers. There\u2019s just no way that Russia\u2019s security is under threat. \n\nAnd even the nuclear deterrent aside, who is it that would invade Russia? Poland? Germany, whose military is famously in shambles? The US, which has a small token amount of forces stationed in Eastern Europe, and until Russia\u2019s first invasion in 2014 didn\u2019t even have that? Europe wants cheap Russian gas, the US wants to be able to focus on China. Token demonstrations against Russia\u2019s authoritarianism aside, everyone would be happy to deal with a peaceful, inwardly focused Russia, like they did up until 2014. \n\nWhat \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d easily turns into, sometimes intentionally sometimes not, is a euphemism to justify Russian neo-imperialism.

There\u2019s just no way that Russia\u2019s security is under threat. </p>\n\n<p>And even the nuclear deterrent aside, who is it that would invade Russia? Poland? Germany, whose military is famously in shambles? The US, which has a small token amount of forces stationed in Eastern Europe, and until Russia\u2019s first invasion in 2014 didn\u2019t even have that? Europe wants cheap Russian gas, the US wants to be able to focus on China. Token demonstrations against Russia\u2019s authoritarianism aside, everyone would be happy to deal with a peaceful, inwardly focused Russia, like they did up until 2014. </p>\n\n<p>What \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d easily turns into, sometimes intentionally sometimes not, is a euphemism to justify Russian neo-imperialism.

Record footage, submit it to a certain location (likely a centralized, clearinghouse email address since the footage is digital and they all have internet access even on the front lines), and then it&#39;s sorted out, edited to look good, and released into the wild as propaganda where pro-Ukraine internet viewers watch their daily dose of war porn that shows the Russians getting their asses kicked, fueling increased resistance, positivity, and international support for Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

And speaking of ex-Soviet countries, they are not uniformly hawkish on Russia, it&#39;s only the case with European states. In Central Asia and Caucasus, it&#39;s different.

I feel like he felt the Russian state could withstand the blow of these sanctions. But caught between sanctions and an active war, it has probably become far more difficult to deal with both of these conditions at the same time. \n\nI think the Russians thought that they were prepared enough for more sanctions that they could spend more of their energy and time on workarounds for their economy. But under a war, that has become more difficult. \n\n>It's difficult to predict, but I think the reaction would in both cases go beyond concerned words. Modi explicitly warned against nuclear escalation and Xi promised to protect Ukraine against nuclear aggression (back in 2013/2015, but it's still valid today and his credibility is on the table).\n\nI think it is more likely that they will ask to host peace talks between the Ukrainians and Russians and act as intermediaries between the two sides.

Recently, RUSI (IIRC) got their hands on the Russian invasion plans and while very detailed, they completely lacked contigencies. It truly looks like Putin expected smooth immediate success and didn&#39;t plan for the possibility it won&#39;t go his way. In such a case, presenting the world a fait accompli, international reaction would likely be much smaller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure but even if an invasion had been successful, he probably knew that further sanctions were coming anyway. I feel like he felt the Russian state could withstand the blow of these sanctions. But caught between sanctions and an active war, it has probably become far more difficult to deal with both of these conditions at the same time. </p>\n\n<p>I think the Russians thought that they were prepared enough for more sanctions that they could spend more of their energy and time on workarounds for their economy. But under a war, that has become more difficult. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s difficult to predict, but I think the reaction would in both cases go beyond concerned words. Modi explicitly warned against nuclear escalation and Xi promised to protect Ukraine against nuclear aggression (back in 2013/2015, but it&#39;s still valid today and his credibility is on the table).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it is more likely that they will ask to host peace talks between the Ukrainians and Russians and act as intermediaries between the two sides.

This situation sucks.</p>\n</div>",

The alternative would be just winning by killing all of the other guys first, but that doesn't seem like a realistically achievable goal for any side.\n\nAnd if resolve is the main resource, then doesn't that paint a fairly bleak picture? We know that Ukraine's resolve is effectively infinite. We also can say with good confidence that the West's isn't - there's only so much that Western societies will be willing to sacrifice for this war. And my biggest worry is that Russia's resolve could in fact also be effectively infinite - between the huge (yet still growing) domestic popularity of the war, the opposition's unwillingness to effect change and its lack of tools to do so, it's just hard to see a scenario where Russia goes \"alright, we've spent enough resources and lost enough men, we're going home now\" They might fight badly and they might not advance much, but if they just continue to slog along relying on their own society's infinite resolve to fight, aren't they guaranteed to eventually outlast Western support? \n\nAnd if we assume that Russian resolve is in fact finite, what are the conditions to erode it? So far international condemnation, sanctions, domestic repression and tens of thousands of deaths have only rallied the people around the flag.",
