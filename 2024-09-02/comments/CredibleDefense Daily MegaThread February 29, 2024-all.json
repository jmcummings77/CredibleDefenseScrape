It's easy to underestimate the size because most common map projections like Mercator make countries nearer the equator seem smaller than those closer to the poles. But it's really just this enormous stretch of largely underdeveloped (albeit not uninhabited... just incredibly poor) jungle and mountainous jungle, where it is difficult to target air strikes effectively. It's comparable to the US experience in Vietnam and in particular with the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Even if you know precisely where a road you want to strike is located, roads are easy to repair and not worth striking unless there is a target on it. And the jungle makes it almost impossible to know when a valuable target is present. The Tatmadaw lacks anywhere near the level of capabilities required for effective aerial suppression of insurgents in a jungle.\n\nThe nature of the insurgency also makes it relatively resilient to air power. The various PDFs are almost exclusively irregular infantry forces with at best technicals for mobility, and more often nothing other than their own two feet. This is a country where a top of the line taxi servicing wealthy foreigners in the biggest city (Yangon) is probably a 40 year-old, mildewy Toyota Corolla with a rusted out chassis and holes in the floor. Rebels in even more impoverished rural areas won't even have that level of mobility in many cases, and will instead be largely moving around on foot. Mig-29s just aren't that useful for striking small groups of soldiers on foot under thick jungle canopy.",

They want the replacement frigates to enter service \"in the next decade\", but that still leaves only about 35 years of use of the old frigates.

These task forces will include air and missile defense units, as well as ones equipped with new long-range missile systems, including hypersonic types. They will also have new electronic and cyber warfare systems and other advanced capabilities. Additional air and missile defense units separate from the MDTFs are set to be established.*\n\n*The white paper makes clear that new air and missile defenses are absolutely central to these plans. Each of the five MDTFs will include what is currently being called an \"indirect fire protection capability (IFPC) battalion.\" In addition, the service wants to stand up four more independent IFPC battalions. The Army has defined this unit's core mission as \"providing a short to medium-range capability to defend against unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles, rockets, artillery and mortars.\"*\n\n*Though not explicitly mentioned in the Army's overview of its new force structure plans, the IFPC battalion's primary weapon is expected to be the Enduring Shield.

The system is set to be initially fielded with AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range heat-seeking missiles as its primary effector, but the Army is already pursuing another interceptor more optimized for shooting down incoming subsonic and supersonic cruise missiles.*\n\n*The Army's new force structure plans also call for the creation of nine \"counter-small UAS (C-sUAS) batteries\" that will be attached to the IFPC battalions and existing division-level air defense battalions. It's unknown at this time how these batteries will be equipped, but this all follows the service's announcement of plans to significantly expand its inventory of Coyote anti-drone interceptors, and mobile and fixed launchers for them, in the next five years.*\n\n*Lastly, the Army's force structure white paper outlines plans to stand up four more Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) battalions to help \"counter low altitude aerial threats, including UAS, rotary wing aircraft, and fixed-wing aircraft.\" The Army already has two M-SHORAD battalions and is in the process of establishing a third.*",

        "body": "Quick update on the order of battle in Avdiivka. The 1st and 2nd Assault Battalions (or elements of them?) of the 3rd Assault Brigade, according to the brigade's official sources, have been redeployed 20ish kms to the south, to Krasnohorivka (north of Marinka), in order to support the 3rd Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade in defending this village. Earlier this week, elements of the Russian 5th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, after occupying the Trudovski mine (which has changed hands several times over the recent months) had launched a mechanized attack towards the village and managed to occupy some houses in its southern end, although at the moment, thanks to Ukrainian reinforcements, they appear to have been pushed back. The Russians are forced to attack from the south (from Marinka), as attacking from the east (from Staromykhailivka) would see them encountering many more Ukrainian trenches. \n\nFurther north, the 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps made progress towards Nevelske, arriving at the gates of the settlement. The 69th Covering Brigade (35th CAA), which Naalsio of WarSpotting had identified in this area because of the tactical marks on a destroyed BMP-1, should not be here. There are indications that it's in its usual Polohy sector - if anything I would not rule out that some armored vehicles were transferred to compensate for heavy material losses of the units around Avdiivka (there is evidence that the 25th CAA sent some of its armored vehicles to the 41st CAA and possibly to the 2nd CAA).\n\nElements of the Ukrainian 25th Airborne Brigade have been transferred to the Avdiivka sector (until now the brigade was active north of Svatove, with a battalion in the Kreminna sector), specifically to Orlivka. It's unclear whether it's just one battalion or the entire brigade. In recent days the Russian MoD has mentioned, in bulletins of the Group of Forces \"Centre\" (which has the responsibility for the Avdiivka sector) the presence of the Ukrainian 61st Mechanized Brigade. Today, for the first time, I came across a MIA notice of a serviceman from the 100th Mech Battalion of the 61st Mech Brigade, which disappeared in Lastochkyne on February 21. This brigade had been covering the state border along the Chernihiv Oblast for about a year, after it played an important role in the battle of Soledar. Again, we don't know whether it's only a battalion or the entire brigade, which should be very fresh. It should be noted, though, that it was the last brigade of the UAF in the strategic reserve. \n\nOf the other brigades I had listed some times ago: the 62nd Mechanized Brigade possibly no longer exists. It has no social media presence nor is it mentioned by Ukrainians at all, e.g. for crowdfunding events etc. There are several official obituaries of soldiers from this brigade who died in Kurdyumivka (southern flank of Bakhmut) between October and December 2022, but nothing has been heard of it ever since. The 101st Brigade for the Protection of the General Staff is likely in the Horlivka sector. The 13th Jager Brigade and the 88th Mech Brigade, which were created in early 2023, have yet to be officially deployed and disappeared from any radar. Battalions of the four new infantry brigades (from 141st to 144th) have finished training and are gradually being deployed along the front as separate battalions. The 5th Tank Brigade and the five new mechanized brigades (from 150th to 154th) are still in the training stage. Of course, I am excluding the numerous territorial defense battalions located along the border with Belarus and with Russia in the north as well as the separate rifle battalions, which are countless. The last two brigades of the Offensive Guard have been deployed recently (\"Khartiia\" in the Kreminna sector and \"Pomsta\" seems to be divided between the southern flank of Bakhmut and the Svatove sector); in the National Guard there are, however, some new brigades and regiments formed in late 2023 by reforming smaller units, along with several new separate battalions, of which it's not easy at all to keep tracks of.\n\nReturning to Avdiivka, the southern area (Tonenke) is defended by the 53rd Mech Brigade, the central area (Orlivka) by the bulk of the 3rd Assault Brigade and the other units mentioned above as well as by the 225th Separate Assault Battalion, the northern area (Berdychi) by the 47th Mech Brigade along with other smaller units such as separate rifle and territorial defense battalions. The maneuver units of the 110th Mech Brigade should have been completely withdrawn, while its artillery group and the UAV unit currently remain in the sector. The area around Novokalynove is defended by the 71st Jager Brigade and other smaller units, near Ocheretyne there should also be elements of the 23rd and 31st Mech Brigades together with units of the Separate Presidential Brigade. In any case, the bulk of the former brigades have been moved south of Marinka: the 23rd Mech Brigade is fighting near Pobjeda, where the 425th Separate Assault Battalion \"Skala\", which was transferred under the command of this brigade, has also been moved to, from Avdiivka; the 31st Mech Brigade is fighting further south, in the direction of Solodke. \n\nA couple of weeks ago a video had come out about an abandoned and damaged Leopard 2A4 near Pobjeda. This made me very curious because the only unit equipped with them is the 33rd Mech Brigade. Several Leopard 2A4s have since been lost around Pobjeda. Rybar mentioned the 33rd Mech Brigade as being in the area, and in the following days several MIA notices of servicemen from this brigade came out, with them mentioning Pobjeda. This brigade was transferred to this area in early February, from Robotyne. At the same time, it appears that the 116th Mech Brigade, which was active in the north-eastern flank of Avdiivka along with the 47th Mech Brigade, has returned to the Orikhiv sector, possibly to replace the 33rd Mech Brigade. Since mid-February, the Khorne Group (the UAV unit of the 116th) has been posting videos from Orikhiv, and it appears that the brigade's tank battalion and the artillery group have also returned there (from where they were transferred to Avdiivka back in November).\n\nAs for the Russians, Russian sources mentioned the presence of the 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD in Avdiivka. With this, we now officially know that every single regiment of this division is in Avdiivka, which also represents the formation with the best combat capabilities the Russians have right now in the sector. Both Ukrainian and Russian sources have mentioned the recent transfer of Russian units from Avdiivka to Bakhmut, but I have not found any confirmation to this. Perhaps they could be smaller units of the 1st Corps or of the 3rd Corps, or elements of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps, for instance the \"Hispaniola\" Assault and Recon Brigade. \n\nThat said, the 15th and the 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd CAA are currently attacking towards Berdychi. The 21st and the 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd CAA, the 35th Motorized Brigade and the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA and the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps are attacking towards Orlivka, with support from the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, while the elements of the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA that have retained combat capabilities (this brigade suffered very heavy losses in the final phase of the battle of Avdiivka) are being kept in the rear. The 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, together with the 87th Motorized Regiment of the same corps, the 1453rd Regiment of the Territorial Forces and the 10th Tank Regiment (which is no longer part of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps but of the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA) are attacking towards Tonenke. By the way, it looks like that in Avdiivka there are no longer elements of the 3rd Corps, as far as we can see. The Russians have decided to continue the offensive in the Avdiivka sector, despite the far-from-optimal status of many of the units involved (which are continually being replenished with manpower from the Territorial Forces), in order to prevent the Ukrainians from buying time and fortify the lines. But we will discuss on this in better detail another time, along with what's going on elsewhere.",

There are indications that it&#39;s in its usual Polohy sector - if anything I would not rule out that some armored vehicles were transferred to compensate for heavy material losses of the units around Avdiivka (there is evidence that the 25th CAA sent some of its armored vehicles to the 41st CAA and possibly to the 2nd CAA).</p>\n\n<p>Elements of the Ukrainian 25th Airborne Brigade have been transferred to the Avdiivka sector (until now the brigade was active north of Svatove, with a battalion in the Kreminna sector), specifically to Orlivka. It&#39;s unclear whether it&#39;s just one battalion or the entire brigade. In recent days the Russian MoD has mentioned, in bulletins of the Group of Forces &quot;Centre&quot; (which has the responsibility for the Avdiivka sector) the presence of the Ukrainian 61st Mechanized Brigade. Today, for the first time, I came across a MIA notice of a serviceman from the 100th Mech Battalion of the 61st Mech Brigade, which disappeared in Lastochkyne on February 21. This brigade had been covering the state border along the Chernihiv Oblast for about a year, after it played an important role in the battle of Soledar. Again, we don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s only a battalion or the entire brigade, which should be very fresh. It should be noted, though, that it was the last brigade of the UAF in the strategic reserve. </p>\n\n<p>Of the other brigades I had listed some times ago: the 62nd Mechanized Brigade possibly no longer exists. It has no social media presence nor is it mentioned by Ukrainians at all, e.g. for crowdfunding events etc. There are several official obituaries of soldiers from this brigade who died in Kurdyumivka (southern flank of Bakhmut) between October and December 2022, but nothing has been heard of it ever since. The 101st Brigade for the Protection of the General Staff is likely in the Horlivka sector. The 13th Jager Brigade and the 88th Mech Brigade, which were created in early 2023, have yet to be officially deployed and disappeared from any radar. Battalions of the four new infantry brigades (from 141st to 144th) have finished training and are gradually being deployed along the front as separate battalions. The 5th Tank Brigade and the five new mechanized brigades (from 150th to 154th) are still in the training stage. Of course, I am excluding the numerous territorial defense battalions located along the border with Belarus and with Russia in the north as well as the separate rifle battalions, which are countless. The last two brigades of the Offensive Guard have been deployed recently (&quot;Khartiia&quot; in the Kreminna sector and &quot;Pomsta&quot; seems to be divided between the southern flank of Bakhmut and the Svatove sector); in the National Guard there are, however, some new brigades and regiments formed in late 2023 by reforming smaller units, along with several new separate battalions, of which it&#39;s not easy at all to keep tracks of.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to Avdiivka, the southern area (Tonenke) is defended by the 53rd Mech Brigade, the central area (Orlivka) by the bulk of the 3rd Assault Brigade and the other units mentioned above as well as by the 225th Separate Assault Battalion, the northern area (Berdychi) by the 47th Mech Brigade along with other smaller units such as separate rifle and territorial defense battalions. The maneuver units of the 110th Mech Brigade should have been completely withdrawn, while its artillery group and the UAV unit currently remain in the sector. The area around Novokalynove is defended by the 71st Jager Brigade and other smaller units, near Ocheretyne there should also be elements of the 23rd and 31st Mech Brigades together with units of the Separate Presidential Brigade. In any case, the bulk of the former brigades have been moved south of Marinka: the 23rd Mech Brigade is fighting near Pobjeda, where the 425th Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Skala&quot;, which was transferred under the command of this brigade, has also been moved to, from Avdiivka; the 31st Mech Brigade is fighting further south, in the direction of Solodke. </p>\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago a video had come out about an abandoned and damaged Leopard 2A4 near Pobjeda. This made me very curious because the only unit equipped with them is the 33rd Mech Brigade. Several Leopard 2A4s have since been lost around Pobjeda. Rybar mentioned the 33rd Mech Brigade as being in the area, and in the following days several MIA notices of servicemen from this brigade came out, with them mentioning Pobjeda. This brigade was transferred to this area in early February, from Robotyne. At the same time, it appears that the 116th Mech Brigade, which was active in the north-eastern flank of Avdiivka along with the 47th Mech Brigade, has returned to the Orikhiv sector, possibly to replace the 33rd Mech Brigade. Since mid-February, the Khorne Group (the UAV unit of the 116th) has been posting videos from Orikhiv, and it appears that the brigade&#39;s tank battalion and the artillery group have also returned there (from where they were transferred to Avdiivka back in November).</p>\n\n<p>As for the Russians, Russian sources mentioned the presence of the 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD in Avdiivka. With this, we now officially know that every single regiment of this division is in Avdiivka, which also represents the formation with the best combat capabilities the Russians have right now in the sector. Both Ukrainian and Russian sources have mentioned the recent transfer of Russian units from Avdiivka to Bakhmut, but I have not found any confirmation to this. Perhaps they could be smaller units of the 1st Corps or of the 3rd Corps, or elements of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps, for instance the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; Assault and Recon Brigade. </p>\n\n<p>That said, the 15th and the 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd CAA are currently attacking towards Berdychi. The 21st and the 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd CAA, the 35th Motorized Brigade and the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA and the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps are attacking towards Orlivka, with support from the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, while the elements of the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA that have retained combat capabilities (this brigade suffered very heavy losses in the final phase of the battle of Avdiivka) are being kept in the rear. The 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, together with the 87th Motorized Regiment of the same corps, the 1453rd Regiment of the Territorial Forces and the 10th Tank Regiment (which is no longer part of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps but of the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA) are attacking towards Tonenke. By the way, it looks like that in Avdiivka there are no longer elements of the 3rd Corps, as far as we can see. The Russians have decided to continue the offensive in the Avdiivka sector, despite the far-from-optimal status of many of the units involved (which are continually being replenished with manpower from the Territorial Forces), in order to prevent the Ukrainians from buying time and fortify the lines. But we will discuss on this in better detail another time, along with what&#39;s going on elsewhere.</p>\n</div>",

Most people (including myself, more often than I'd like to admit) just say \"Gaza\" and leave it at that, without much nuance. \n\n\nI mean, It's an area double the size of Mosul, with an even bigger population.

The infrastructure to redirect those exports to other markets did not and does not yet exist, so I would expect the Russians to have excess refining capacity available for the domestic market now that foreign demand has dropped so significantly. Similarly, because so little of their refining capacity is dedicated to exports following sanctions, restricting exports does not seem like an effective economic policy, because it will do little to nothing to increase domestic supplies.\n\nMoreover, presumably that excess capacity provides an additional buffer with which they can absorb damages to their refining infrastructure before experiencing domestic supply disruption. That capacity is, from what I understand at least, spread across more than a handful of facilities, so would in theory take more than a handful of strikes to meaningfully disrupt.\n\nAll of which is to say, the electioneering/economic stimulus angle seems like a better explanation for the policy than adaptation to Ukrainian strikes is. We could be seeing the first indicators of runaway inflation kicking off, which seems like it will be an inevitable result of the Russian government's wartime spending spree in a geopolitical context where the Russian economy cannot grow via international trade. Record amounts of rubles are being poured into an economy that is only capable of efficiently absorbing new investment at a certain rate. Any excess simply inflates asset values, and that in turns drives price increases across the economy. \n\nOften gas prices are the canary in the coal mine for general inflation, because energy is an input to every other sector of the economy and thus energy inflation frequently drives inflation across the rest of the economy. Gas prices are often also politically sensitive, because the price of gas at the pump is a concrete indicator of the overall state of the economy (which is especially valuable in a totalitarian state where accurate economic indicators may not otherwise be available to average individuals), and which individuals experience directly on a daily basis. Thus, even if a gas export ban does little or nothing to restrain energy inflation, it shows the government responding to an issue that the voters care about, and so makes sense at a minimum as optics management.\n\nEdit: this video goes into more detail about the Ukrainian strikes and why they probably aren't driving the gas export ban, and overall it comes to similar conclusions as I did, specifically identifying war funding driving inflation as the most likely primary cause. It also makes the excellent point that Russia's petroleum industry may simply lack the necessary technical capacities to maintain their infrastructure in the presence of sanctions, which may explain the extraordinarily long maintenance times referenced by Putin as the justification for the ban. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8YbBiq_2yo",

He believes that in that scenario, the nuclear armed nations (France/UK/US) will fold because starting a nuclear war over the Baltics will not be worth it. In both scenarios, NATO will be discredited, Biden will lose the elections because of that mishandling. Trump will be elected, he will change the internal \"liberal\" political spectrum of the US while in its external relations, he will let Europe handle its own defence while the US will secure the global order (such as shipping). \n\nHe also said that during that ultimatum, where practically the west will fold, the Russians (and the west) will force their ceasefire terms of the later on Ukrainians. After that the Russians will just prepare for the next phase of the war for which the Ukraine must prepare for by improving its military and industry using any reconstruction aid from Europe. He said that he believes that Ukraine will fail to prepare adequately and will be completely conquered in 10 years due to the corruption of its politicians. He also strongly supported neutrality.
