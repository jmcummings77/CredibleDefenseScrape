It is not that nowhere on the map is decisive, it is just that Ukraine's decisions to take or defend territory seem to be dictated much more by tactical considerations than Russia. Russia has repeatedly moved into territory that is difficult to defend just because they could and then had to scale back their ambitions after great losses. \n\nUkraine on the other hand has been willing to cede difficult to hold land and on the flip side make daring attacks for tactically advantageous ground. At countless points they have secured their lines along the high parts of bluffs, in cities, and along rivers. When they have clung to salients like at Lysychansk it was only in cases where they evidently were able to inflict disproportionate casualties, and left as soon as that dynamic changed. In every case, Ukraine has taken the lessons of Vauban to heart.\n\nSo I would agree with your idea that Ukraine does not view any particular area as strategically vital for ending the war, in a sense they are playing for attrition. But certain areas, dictated by the circumstances of the campaign are still vital to Ukraine in that they are better for exhausting Russia and forcing more retreats. In this sense, they won't just attack anywhere. I don't think they merely want to probe for anywhere weak to breakthrough, nor are they unwilling to make daring attacks that might entail heavy casualties, it is just that their metric is maximum effectiveness. They are going for pitched battles at every scale.",

The list is pretty long.\n\nHow exactly does the U.S. coordinate with those completely compromised governments and intelligence agencies?

        "body": "Man, looks like the ultra-patriotic boomer website topwar is totally broken by 8 months of war and the latest defeat in particular. One of the most discussed articles now, worth a read:     \n\n\n> **The West is burying the myth of the \"Russian bear\"**\n> \n> This is the normal course of events. The Spanish, Italian, and French media are gradually starting to talk about the idea that \"the Russian bear is not so scary\". This is probably the first time since the collapse of the USSR that they have stopped being afraid of us. It's a rather regrettable moment, because no one respected Russia very much anyway.\n> \n> \n> On the other hand, historically we did not need it. Respect is for the rich or clever. The strong are usually feared, and here Russia is in its role as the successor to the Soviet Union, which was feared for good reason: a powerful ideology, a huge army, a decent (by the standards of the 1970s) navy, and a brilliant diplomatic corps, which was able to justify anything.\n> \n> Today the Russian navy is a frankly miserable spectacle of old Soviet ships with a few new ones thrown in. The reliability and combat effectiveness of the former has already been proven by the Moskva, so there is no need to go into detail here. The latter - corvettes and boats, even if armed with modern missile weapons, because of their small number would not play any role in any conflict, just as they do not play a role in the SMO. The only thing of any combat value is the nuclear-powered submarine fleet, but it is not a panacea for all problems. As a means of deterrence, though, it is still quite good.\n> \n> The current Russian army, which until recently ranked second in the world according to the Global Firepower website, which has been evaluating the armies of 140 countries for 17 years, is rapidly losing credibility. And it is not about the ratings, it is about the AFU, which ranked 22nd in the world on the one hand and the capabilities of the Russian army on the other.\n> \n> Yes, experts from GF use more than 50 parameters, from the amount of funding to logistics and geographical features of the country and nearby theater. And according to GF's unique formulas, which do not involve the use of nuclear weapons, the armies of even small states are able to compete in the combat readiness rating with the armies of countries such as Russia, India and China.\n> \n> That, in fact, is what the Ukrainian army is demonstrating today. Yes, pumped up by NATO, but still. The 22nd ranked army is not just successfully confronts the 2nd, it is difficult to characterize the current state of affairs at all.\n> \n> It is also worth saying a few words about the Russian Air Force. After the triumphant successes in Syria, where, let's be honest, our pilots had no opponents either in the sky or on the ground, the operations in Ukraine, where the air defense system could never be neutralized, and then the Soviet models were replaced by Western ones, proved to be very difficult.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Man, looks like the ultra-patriotic boomer website topwar is totally broken by 8 months of war and the latest defeat in particular. One of the most discussed articles now, worth a read:     </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The West is burying the myth of the &quot;Russian bear&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the normal course of events. The Spanish, Italian, and French media are gradually starting to talk about the idea that &quot;the Russian bear is not so scary&quot;. This is probably the first time since the collapse of the USSR that they have stopped being afraid of us. It&#39;s a rather regrettable moment, because no one respected Russia very much anyway.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, historically we did not need it. Respect is for the rich or clever. The strong are usually feared, and here Russia is in its role as the successor to the Soviet Union, which was feared for good reason: a powerful ideology, a huge army, a decent (by the standards of the 1970s) navy, and a brilliant diplomatic corps, which was able to justify anything.</p>\n\n<p>Today the Russian navy is a frankly miserable spectacle of old Soviet ships with a few new ones thrown in. The reliability and combat effectiveness of the former has already been proven by the Moskva, so there is no need to go into detail here. The latter - corvettes and boats, even if armed with modern missile weapons, because of their small number would not play any role in any conflict, just as they do not play a role in the SMO. The only thing of any combat value is the nuclear-powered submarine fleet, but it is not a panacea for all problems. As a means of deterrence, though, it is still quite good.</p>\n\n<p>The current Russian army, which until recently ranked second in the world according to the Global Firepower website, which has been evaluating the armies of 140 countries for 17 years, is rapidly losing credibility. And it is not about the ratings, it is about the AFU, which ranked 22nd in the world on the one hand and the capabilities of the Russian army on the other.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, experts from GF use more than 50 parameters, from the amount of funding to logistics and geographical features of the country and nearby theater. And according to GF&#39;s unique formulas, which do not involve the use of nuclear weapons, the armies of even small states are able to compete in the combat readiness rating with the armies of countries such as Russia, India and China.</p>\n\n<p>That, in fact, is what the Ukrainian army is demonstrating today. Yes, pumped up by NATO, but still. The 22nd ranked army is not just successfully confronts the 2nd, it is difficult to characterize the current state of affairs at all.</p>\n\n<p>It is also worth saying a few words about the Russian Air Force. After the triumphant successes in Syria, where, let&#39;s be honest, our pilots had no opponents either in the sky or on the ground, the operations in Ukraine, where the air defense system could never be neutralized, and then the Soviet models were replaced by Western ones, proved to be very difficult. And so far in the air defense and air force battle, the air defense clearly has the upper hand.</p>\n\n<p>And diplomacy today is not what it was in Soviet times. Yes, of course, today it is already obvious that the UN is an arena for vetoes. The question is who will veto whom. It is simply unrealistic to make any decision in favor of Russia, in the same way Russia blocks all decisions directed in its direction. Stalemate, parity, call it what you like.</p>\n\n<p>However, one cannot but admit that Russia&#39;s diplomatic corps has degenerated and collapsed to the level of the Ministry of Expression of Concerns.

        "body": "Some thoughts with the conclusion of the Kherson Offensive\n\nWith both the Lyman and Kherson offensives (and currently developing offensive actions against Svatove), Ukraine has prioritized force preservation over risky offensive actions. They've done so by focusing on action that makes holding key defensive terrain untenable for the Russians, *not* rapid, sweeping encirclement or assault operations. No better example of this than in Kherson, where the Ukrainians steadily attritioned vulnerable supply lines into the province, and only pushed in when the majority of the Russian force had vacated their positions. You also saw something similar in Lyman. The Ukrainians partially encircled the town and established limited fire control over the roads leading out of it, but did not move to decisively encircle/capture the forces within it, preferring instead to allow them to retreat and attrion them on the way out.   \n\nSo why default to this strategy? I think its possible in Kherson they truly did not know the Russians were leaving until the majority of the force had left the left bank. However, I also think its very possible they just didn't care. Even against a retreating force Kherson was *heavily* fortified, the AFU would've probably faced heavy resistance if they had started a push 3 weeks ago. I think the AFU's is basically prioritizing the preservation of their formations over decisively destroying Russian formations. Unlike the Russians they don't have a super deep well of material to draw on, and it isn't clear exactly how far the West will go in terms of heavy equipment. I also suspect many of Ukraine's formations are still not that well trained, so spending their veterans in rough offensive terrain like Kherson to snag mobilized troops may seem like a bad trade.\n\nA few other thoughts\n\n1. The Shaed drone story has been interesting to me because it obviously has a large impact on the civil economy of Ukraine but I don't see it impacting the reality on the front-line. Tyler Rogoway made a good point that these attacks have also hastened Ukraine's acquisition of a modern AD system, that may make it even riskier for the Russian Air Force to support front-line units. I don't know exactly where this will land, but I don't think these drones solve much for Russia, even if they continue to be successful. One of Putin's biggest problems is Ukraine's willingness to continue the war, and I can't see that ebbing while they're still retaking land \n\n2. Someone else called it out earlier but I think its interesting how much of the latest aid packages to Ukraine have focused on MRAP/APC style armor. I'm unsure if this is a specific request by the AFU or if its just the highest level of Western armor the US/EU is willing to provide. But all of it, combined with Russian armor/ifv captures points at more mobility for AFU formations going forward. I do think its interesting how much of the early commentary in this war was focused on the utility/primacy of light infantry. I still think that's true to a degree but clearly purely foot mobile infantry is limited to a great degree, and I think the AFU is purposely trying to rectify that\n\n3. The Ukrainians have captured about 20 t-62s so far, probably more are scattered around Kherson. Wonder what they'll do with them.\n\n4. The contrast between the Russian and Ukrainian offensive styles appears apparent in the SouthEast. From what I understand, the Russians are trying to muscle through Ukrainian defensive lines with pure force and mobilized/Wagner manpower. But unlike the AFU, it seems to me the Russians are happy to directly engage strong defensive lines, and are taking serious losses for it.I don't know a ton about this section of the theater, can anyone give a generous interpretation of what they're thinking? The offensives back in the Spring/Summer worked in part because the Russians had overwhelming artillery superiority, I don't think that's strictly the case anymore. Obviously with mobilization they have a ton of manpower, but there has to be *some* political cost associated with mass causality offensive actions with these guys. Are the Russians making a good, if costly bet? Or are they just slamming their heads into the wall like they've been doing with Bakhmut all year\n\n5. It sounds like the Russians are holding back a substantial amount of their mobilized troops for training. Curious to see if this amounts to anything, unclear to me they have the infrastructure or people to do a good job of training these troops, even if they do have the time. Western training of Ukrainian troops might be a big advantage if they can materially up their quality, although I'm skeptical on what they can do with five weeks. Do suspect there are larger specialist training programs in the west that we don't hear about that probably take longer",

People should take a closer look at the terrain along the Dnipro West of Kherson all the way to Kinburn, because just looking at the zoomed out map gives a very false impression of the tactical situation.\n\nWhat you have is about 60 miles of extremely rugged and varied terrain with a single poorly paved road and about a million places to hide. There are thick woods, there are vast sand dunes, there are marshes, there are lakes, and coves, and inlets, streams and an absolute maze of sandy dirt track paths and water. For example, in the West, consider the area around Herois'ke. You have a tangle of marshy beaches, a densely packed little town, a mile of tangled woods, then a total clusterfuck of lakes and woods and streams till the southern coast. You could absolutely not pick worse terrain for Russia style logistics and top down command hierarchy, and you could not pick better place for self directing Ukrainian light infantry to operate out of. Everywhere is ambush locations, places to hide from drones, and hard areas to reach any way but by foot, boat, and atv.\n\nI think that from now until the rest of Kherson Oblast is liberated, at night the Ukrainians are going to sneak over rubber dinghy's full of Jagers all along that coastline, and they are going to take control of the coastal highway. Dislodging them will be impossible for the Russians, because supplying troops anywhere in the area would leave them extremely vulnerable to being cutoff themselves. I would guess that anything west of the two Zburivka's is going to be ceded to Ukraine, and substantial Russian forces are going to have to be kept near those towns indefinitely to prevent them expanding eastward. I'd also speculate that the islands in the Dnipro delta will all be taken over by Ukrainian light infantry up to the Konka river everywhere in the west. 1000% the Russians are not brave enough to send troops to these islands because they will fear get bypassed, but the Ukrainians can find locals who know the swamps well and can guide them through, keep them supplied with food, etc. So I think that while a full scale invasion across the Dnipro would be difficult now, the Dnipro will not at all be a nice clean border for the Russians from now on. They are going to have to watch their backs really carefully in the whole area because the frontline will be a cloudy murky sieve.",

CO-8 is uncalled because it is so close, but the Democrat there has a 1,500 vote lead with no votes left to count. The California races all feature the same pattern (votes usually get more Dem as the counting goes), and all of those races feature Dem leads and should be called soon.\n\nCA 9 and CA 47 have a lot more vote out and aren't safe yet, but they both have Dem leads so I have them at likely D. That's 212\n\nCA 13, CA 22, and CA 41 have Republican in the lead right now, but not by much, so it's probable to an extent that Dems will take the lead in those races too. OR 6 also has a narrow Dem lead right now that probably has better than even odds of shaking out, so that's 216.\n\nGetting past 216 is difficult.
