Recent clashes between Houthi fighters and forces backed by the UAE have already left nearly two dozen dead.\n\n>Tensions have bubbled between the two Gulf Arab powers on and off the Yemeni battlefield for years. But growing calls by UAE-backed Yemeni separatists for a break-off state in the south have infuriated Riyadh, which wants Yemen to remain intact. The Biden administration is alarmed by the row and fears it will strengthen Iran and scuttle a key foreign policy goal: Ending the eight-year war that has claimed almost 400,000 lives and become a political liability for the US, said a senior Western official who communicates directly with the conflict\u2019s main local, regional and international players.\n\n>\"Yemen is becoming an arena for Saudi Arabia and the UAE to compete and settle their scores through local proxies, diminishing chances for a political compromise,\" said Ahmed Nagi, senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group\n\n>A UAE government official said Abu Dhabi fully supports Saudi efforts to end the war and reach a political settlement under the auspices of the United Nations, and called allegations of tensions between the neighbors \u201ccategorically false.\u201d\n\n>>Critical Weeks\n\n>The coming weeks are critical as Saudi Arabia prepares for a new round of talks with Houthi leaders, who threatened Sunday to resume their attacks on the kingdom, including the Neom megaproject, unless their demands for reparations and a large share of oil and gas revenues are met.\n\n>That comes as disagreements with the UAE rumble over other issues. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has increasingly positioned his country as the uncontested regional leader in everything from business, to energy to foreign policy. That\u2019s led to bickering between the traditional allies at OPEC and frustration over a bid to supplant Dubai as the Middle East\u2019s business hub, as well as differences over how to handle common rival Iran.\n\n>In May, the head of a group backed by the UAE angered Saudi Arabia when he rode through Yemen\u2019s southern port city of Al-Mukalla and cast himself as leader of a future southern state.\n\n>Decked out in sunglasses and a dapper suit, Aidarous Al-Zubaidi looked more like a president-in-waiting than a scrappy ex-rebel as he rode through the streets, waving from the open turret of an armored vehicle at the head of a long military convoy. Crowds chanted in support of an independent state \u2014 and in gratitude to their well-heeled backers in the UAE.\n\n>Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the brother of the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler and his point man for Yemen, was incensed by the spectacle that appeared to openly challenge his country\u2019s fraught efforts to end the disastrous war next door, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation. A Saudi Defense Ministry official deferred all comment to the government's Center for International Communication, which did not respond to emailed questions.\n\n>US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking held talks in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh last week aimed at ensuring tensions between the Gulf powers \u2014 and the factions they back \u2014 don\u2019t undermine efforts to end the conflict, according to two Yemeni officials who met with him. His office declined to comment. Saudi government officials did not respond to written questions and multiple follow up calls. A US official, who didn't want to be named because of the delicate discussions underway, said Washington was working through \"existing channels\" toward \"de-escalation and a durable resolution to the conflict.\"\n\n>>Unhappy Marriage\n\n>Poor, divided and pummeled by decades of successive conflicts, Yemen has emerged as key point of friction for Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, as once-warm ties give way to mistrust and competition for economic and political leadership of the Middle East.\n\n>Saudi Arabia resumed diplomatic ties with Iran earlier this year and launched direct talks with the Houthis after years of airstrikes and an economic blockade failed to dislodge them from the Yemeni capital Sanaa.\n\n>To that end, it set up last year a new Yemeni Presidential Leadership Council under Rashad Al-Alimi, a Saudi loyalist trusted by the US, aimed at reconciling the warring factions and stabilizing a border state it sees as key to its national security.\n\n>While the UAE has publicly supported the council, it\u2019s less enthusiastic about accommodating the Houthis and keen on an independent southern state to maintain the influence it has built over a stretch of coast running from Al-Mukalla to Bab Al-Mandeb, a Red Sea gateway that\u2019s critical to enhancing its status in international trade.\n\n>\u201cSome people like to collect stamps and coins,\u201d said Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemen expert and research fellow at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank. \u201cThe UAE loves to collect ports.\u201d\n\n>It sees its interests best served by the secessionist Southern Transitional Council led by Zubaidi, a former army officer in his 60s who nominally serves as Alimi\u2019s deputy.\n\n>Fighters loyal to Zubaidi have clashed with Saudi-backed government forces in the past, notably over control of the strategic port city of Aden. A 2019 agreement to end the infighting failed to address the underlying differences, which are threatening to explode into violence once again.\n\n>Chatham House\u2019s Al-Muslimi compared the Yemeni presidential council to \u201can unhappy arranged marriage.\u201d\n\n>>Hadramout Showdown\n\n>The following month, Zubaidi popped up in the genteel halls of London\u2019s Chatham House, where he told an audience of diplomats and experts he\u2019d fight for the province \u201cno matter the cost.\u201d\n\n>Around the same time, a Saudi Air Force plane landed in Hadramout\u2019s main airport to transport local leaders, including the governor, to Riyadh where they announced the formation of a new regional council to confront the secessionists.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-13/yemen-saudi-and-uae-ambitions-threaten-fragile-truce-with-houthis?srnd=politics-vp\">Saudi-UAE Rift Threatens US Effort to End Yemen War</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>After joining forces against the Iranian-backed Houthis, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are vying for control of a post-war Yemen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A deepening rift over the fate of Yemen is endangering peace prospects with risks for the oil-rich Gulf powers that are at the heart of it.</p>\n\n<p>After joining forces to fight the Iranian-backed Houthi group that looked set to overrun Yemen in 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are backing rival groups vying for control of a country that sits at the crossroads of vital shipping lanes and on the edge of a major energy-exporting region.</p>\n\n<p>Now, divisions over what a post-war Yemen should look like imperil a fragile truce with the Houthis and threaten to escalate into a fresh round of bloodletting between proxy groups supported by the UAE on one side and Saudi Arabia on the other, said four people directly involved in events on the ground. Recent clashes between Houthi fighters and forces backed by the UAE have already left nearly two dozen dead.</p>\n\n<p>Tensions have bubbled between the two Gulf Arab powers on and off the Yemeni battlefield for years. But growing calls by UAE-backed Yemeni separatists for a break-off state in the south have infuriated Riyadh, which wants Yemen to remain intact. The Biden administration is alarmed by the row and fears it will strengthen Iran and scuttle a key foreign policy goal: Ending the eight-year war that has claimed almost 400,000 lives and become a political liability for the US, said a senior Western official who communicates directly with the conflict\u2019s main local, regional and international players.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yemen is becoming an arena for Saudi Arabia and the UAE to compete and settle their scores through local proxies, diminishing chances for a political compromise,&quot; said Ahmed Nagi, senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group</p>\n\n<p>A UAE government official said Abu Dhabi fully supports Saudi efforts to end the war and reach a political settlement under the auspices of the United Nations, and called allegations of tensions between the neighbors \u201ccategorically false.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Critical Weeks</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The coming weeks are critical as Saudi Arabia prepares for a new round of talks with Houthi leaders, who threatened Sunday to resume their attacks on the kingdom, including the Neom megaproject, unless their demands for reparations and a large share of oil and gas revenues are met.</p>\n\n<p>That comes as disagreements with the UAE rumble over other issues. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has increasingly positioned his country as the uncontested regional leader in everything from business, to energy to foreign policy. That\u2019s led to bickering between the traditional allies at OPEC and frustration over a bid to supplant Dubai as the Middle East\u2019s business hub, as well as differences over how to handle common rival Iran.</p>\n\n<p>In May, the head of a group backed by the UAE angered Saudi Arabia when he rode through Yemen\u2019s southern port city of Al-Mukalla and cast himself as leader of a future southern state.</p>\n\n<p>Decked out in sunglasses and a dapper suit, Aidarous Al-Zubaidi looked more like a president-in-waiting than a scrappy ex-rebel as he rode through the streets, waving from the open turret of an armored vehicle at the head of a long military convoy. Crowds chanted in support of an independent state \u2014 and in gratitude to their well-heeled backers in the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the brother of the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler and his point man for Yemen, was incensed by the spectacle that appeared to openly challenge his country\u2019s fraught efforts to end the disastrous war next door, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation. A Saudi Defense Ministry official deferred all comment to the government&#39;s Center for International Communication, which did not respond to emailed questions.</p>\n\n<p>US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking held talks in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh last week aimed at ensuring tensions between the Gulf powers \u2014 and the factions they back \u2014 don\u2019t undermine efforts to end the conflict, according to two Yemeni officials who met with him. His office declined to comment. Saudi government officials did not respond to written questions and multiple follow up calls. A US official, who didn&#39;t want to be named because of the delicate discussions underway, said Washington was working through &quot;existing channels&quot; toward &quot;de-escalation and a durable resolution to the conflict.&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unhappy Marriage</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Poor, divided and pummeled by decades of successive conflicts, Yemen has emerged as key point of friction for Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, as once-warm ties give way to mistrust and competition for economic and political leadership of the Middle East.</p>\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia resumed diplomatic ties with Iran earlier this year and launched direct talks with the Houthis after years of airstrikes and an economic blockade failed to dislodge them from the Yemeni capital Sanaa.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, it set up last year a new Yemeni Presidential Leadership Council under Rashad Al-Alimi, a Saudi loyalist trusted by the US, aimed at reconciling the warring factions and stabilizing a border state it sees as key to its national security.</p>\n\n<p>While the UAE has publicly supported the council, it\u2019s less enthusiastic about accommodating the Houthis and keen on an independent southern state to maintain the influence it has built over a stretch of coast running from Al-Mukalla to Bab Al-Mandeb, a Red Sea gateway that\u2019s critical to enhancing its status in international trade.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSome people like to collect stamps and coins,\u201d said Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemen expert and research fellow at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank. \u201cThe UAE loves to collect ports.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It sees its interests best served by the secessionist Southern Transitional Council led by Zubaidi, a former army officer in his 60s who nominally serves as Alimi\u2019s deputy.</p>\n\n<p>Fighters loyal to Zubaidi have clashed with Saudi-backed government forces in the past, notably over control of the strategic port city of Aden. A 2019 agreement to end the infighting failed to address the underlying differences, which are threatening to explode into violence once again.</p>\n\n<p>Chatham House\u2019s Al-Muslimi compared the Yemeni presidential council to \u201can unhappy arranged marriage.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hadramout Showdown</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The following month, Zubaidi popped up in the genteel halls of London\u2019s Chatham House, where he told an audience of diplomats and experts he\u2019d fight for the province \u201cno matter the cost.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Around the same time, a Saudi Air Force plane landed in Hadramout\u2019s main airport to transport local leaders, including the governor, to Riyadh where they announced the formation of a new regional council to confront the secessionists. It\u2019s a model the Saudis plan to repeat across the south to block any bid for independence.</p>\n\n<p>The ancestral home of some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most prominent business and banking families, Hadramout shares a long and porous frontier with Saudi Arabia.

Korea-KoreaTimes\n\nhttps://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2023/09/205_359166.html\n\nThe U.S. Department of State has approved a possible sale to South Korea of up to 25 F-35A radar-evading fighters and related equipment to help the East Asian ally maintain a \"credible\" defense capability, a government agency said Wednesday.\n\nThe Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) under the Department of Defense made the announcement on the potential government-to-government Foreign Military Sale estimated to cost $5.06 billion.\n\n\"The proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's capability to meet current and future threats by providing credible defense capability to deter aggression in the region and ensure interoperability with U.S. forces,\" DSCA said in a release, referring to South Korea by its official name.\n\nThe South Korean government has requested the purchase of up to 25 F-35A fighters, along with 26 engines, electronic warfare reprogramming lab support and other pieces of related equipment, according to the release.\n\nThe DSCA delivered the required certification notifying Congress of the possible sale earlier in the day, it said, as the sale requires congressional endorsement.\n\nIn March, South Korea's Defense Project Promotion Committee approved a 3.75 trillion-won ($2.82 billion) plan to buy the F-35A aircraft through 2028. The South Korean Air Force currently maintains 40 F-35As manufactured by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin.\n\nSouth Korea has been pushing to bring in a new batch of F-35As to prop up the country's Kill Chain preemptive strike system, a pillar of its three-pronged deterrence program against the North's nuclear and missile threats.

That's undoubtedly part of why the Armenian military is holding joint exercises with the US right now.\n\nThose \"200\" tanks a year quoted in the article probably includes rebuilds. \n\nSince China's microelectronics industry is capable of providing the sort of 2000s tech required by Russian weapons, there's no real long term way to stop them from doing the parts substitution there. The Chinese have reverse engineered a lot of commodity-level microelectronics. The place to hurt the Russians is in integrated manufacturing systems, like machine tools, not in the commodities themselves. There's also probably a number of critical path techs, like gyroscopes, that can be a point of special emphasis. \n\nRussia's biggest long-term problem may be maintenance. They don't seem to have enough maintenance staff to keep their airframes in tip-top condition, if the crash rate is anything to go on. Equipment getting worn out and not being fixed. 200 tanks a year isn't enough to keep up with losses, let alone grow their military capabilities. I think like most modern economies, Russia probably doesn't have enough people in the trades to fight a war and run the technical side of their economy. We've got visually confirmed losses of about 1000 tanks a year, but what we cannot see is how many vehicles are being cannabalized to provide spare parts for others.

So similarly to the tank production math, their production is only 20 % of their burn rate. They're losing a lot of Msta howitzers now too as Ukrainian drones seem to be able to brave Russian air defense and use M31/Excalibur to kill them, usually a few per day.

I'd much rather see this trend continued, step up production near the Ukrainian border, use Ukrianian labor for all I care, just make sure that wherever the factory is is under the NATO umbrella that Russia is too scared to ever touch.",
