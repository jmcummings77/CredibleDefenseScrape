        "body": "I am going to report some interviews of Ukrainian soldiers that I read/watched between yesterday and today that I found interesting to share.\n\nInterview with the [commander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyb_KYnm5_w) and a [soldier](https://www.svoboda.org/a/bitva-za-avdeevku-hronologiya-vzglyad-iznutri-i-itogi/32827248.html) from the 26th Separate Rifle Battalion. I will give a brief summary - those who want to can watch/read the interviews. Let\u2019s remember that this battalion fought for a long time in the Vuhledar sector under the command of the 68th Jager Brigade and in October was transferred under the command of the 47th Mechanized Brigade. \n\nThe battalion arrived in Avdiivka in the period following the beginning of the offensive. They were sent to the front line in the area near the Coke Plant after the Russians had already advanced from Krasnohorivka and occupied the \u201cTerrikon\u201d. There wasn\u2019t any prepared position and they had to dig in themselves. The initial period was difficult; the Russians were shelling Ukrainian positions with long-range artillery and making heavy use of FPV drones and \"resets\" (Ukrainian/Russian term for drones launching  grenades from above). After that, Russian assault troops stormed the positions, finishing off the wounded. The battalion, however, adapted to the challenges: it managed to create decent positions by digging in and reduced enemy drone actions by making extensive use of EW systems (both fixed and portable). At that point the Russians, in order to attack their positions effectively, had to approach the defenders making visual contact with them. It\u2019s said that when there were small arms firefights, the Ukrainians always had the upper hand and the Russians had to withdraw and call in heavy fire support. \n\nI found the tactics used by the Russians extremely reminiscent of Bakhmut. The Russians would continuously send assault teams (8/10/12 personnel) composed of badly trained men in order to probe the Ukrainian defenses, from every direction, until they found a weak point where they recorded greater success. At that point the position was hammered with artillery and KABs, after which the pros (Spetsnazs, scouts, generally well-trained soldiers) would arrive. When they encountered a strong Ukrainian position, the priority was to get a foothold as close as possible, where they would dig in, entrench and take cover while waiting for reinforcements and I assume, place support weapons such as automatic grenade launchers, small caliber mortars and ATGMs. \n\nIt\u2019s mentioned that Ukrainian artillery was active and no great shells hunger was detected - in fact, it was instrumental in destroying entire Russian assault teams (probably the shells allocation for Avdiivka had the highest priority, I imagine). The Bradleys were extremely useful in supporting the infantry during the defense and they did not suffer from any shortage of ammos, although there might be in the future. The 26th Rifle Battalion left Coke Plant on February 15, the day before the last unit to leave the fortress (the 25th Assault Battalion of the 47th Mech Brigade). They said there were falling KABs all the time and even in the underground shelters the walls were shaking, dust was rising, even coffee on the table was completely coming out of the glass. Some underground shelters were flooded because of broken pipes as a result of the bombings. In any case, the Coke Plant was holding out and they were forced to abandon it because the Russians were close to having direct fire control over the only entrance/exit road, which was already being continuously hit by artillery. The soldier laments that Russian vehicles seemed endless: despite having destroyed many of them one of the last days before abandoning the Coke Plant, even more appeared the following day. \n\nAnother soldier from the 26th Rifle Battalion denied rumors of 800+ Ukrainian MIAs/POWs during the retreat from the city, saying that there were probably about a thousand defenders inside the city in total (I guess excluding the Coke Plant etc). In general, to what I gathered, the Ukrainians had very heavy losses in the days of urban fighting and other losses in the withdrawal phase, but not to the extent of those numbers, especially when it comes to POWs. There were certainly several dozen and dozens of prisoners, but not as many as those rumors stated. From a Russian Telegram channel I saw a video showing 20 POWs from the 425th Separate Assault Battalion \"Skala\" - I think the video is legit and that it was perhaps the largest such event. Then there are several videos with 3/4/5 prisoners, especially from the 110th Mech Brigade, but nothing out of the ordinary. One video I saw shows a POW from the 23rd Mech Brigade, claiming that he is part of the brigade's assault detachment (a pseudo penal company composed of soldiers guilty of various violations, which do seem to exist including per Ukrainian sources) and they had been sent to the city in the last few days in order to cover the retreat of the other units. As usual, interviews of prisoners are to be taken with a grain of salt, although it seems plausible to me. But in any case, there is no evidence to confirm certain figures that had come out last week. Last interview in the post below!",

Before the invasion he was a policeman and retired a few months before February 2022. He\u2019s from near Kyiv. On the same morning of the invasion he took to the streets to find weapons and people like him willing to fight and joined the local DFTG. During the following months he was sent abroad to receive actual training, and there he was specialized as an anti-tank operator, being trained in the use of Javelins. He was supposed to remain an instructor, but by his own will he chose to go to the front, joining the \"Svoboda\" Battalion, made up mostly of members of the party with the same name, but in most cases with no military experience (construction workers, lawyers, etc.), where he led the battalion's new anti-tank platoon, which until then had no anti-tank units and was in serious trouble when enemy tanks were sighted. \n\nDuring June and July 2023 there were numerous armored assaults against their positions. Let\u2019s remember that his brigade is defending the central part of the Siversk salient (the area around Spirne), and the assaults were (and are) the work of units from the Russian 2nd Corps. He states that the most fundamental thing for a soldier is to keep calm, never panic and not give in to stress: the soldiers who live are the ones who don\u2019t panic. They used Javelins and Stugnas against Russian tanks: once the first one is hit, often the rest of the column panics, leaves the chosen path, ends up on mines, backs up and flees. He says being an anti-tank operator is very difficult and dangerous. Firing an ATGM is nothing like shooting a rifle. Before assaults, reconnaissance is carried out with drones and anti-tank positions may be busted and hammered with artillery. During the assault, tanks continuously fire against the anti-tank positions and the only thing to do is to pray for luck. Once you repel the column, you have to go back into hiding. He says that since the summer the use of drones by the Russians has increased 10-fold, as has their EW, but the Ukrainians have also grown a lot in this respects. Today most of the losses in his unit are due to FPV drones or \"resets\u201d. The Russians no longer carry out armored attacks in his section of the front, but only infantry assaults in small groups.\n\nHe says interesting things on the emotional level. In early June he lost his best friend, who was fighting together with his two sons in the same unit as the interviewee, and it was a very hard blow for him. His sons had just blown two Russian tanks up. He says morale among the soldiers is high and everyone is convinced of the importance of defending Ukraine. He says that only in war one discovers the true meaning of friendship and that it will be very difficult to get used to civilian life again when the war ends. In any case, he is very disillusioned on this issue: he says that he believes he will not make it to the end of the war alive and that most of his fellow soldiers don\u2019t make plans about what they will do as civilians afterwards, but only hope to make it to the end of the war alive. \n\nAnother interesting thing is about mobilization. He basically says he feels contempt for policemen who don\u2019t want to serve: policemen should be the first to serve since they are trained in the use of weapons, and that they are still in time to go to the front and redeem their dignity. He mentions the \"Dnipro case\". I know what he is referring to and I have recently learned about this issue as well. Basically, in January the \"Dnipro-1\" Police Regiment, from the city with the same name (not to be confused with the \"Dnipro-1\" Battalion of the 31st \"Dnipro\" Brigade of the National Guard), was framed into the \"Lyut\" Assault Brigade of the National Police (part of the Offensive Guard). There were protests from the chiefs and the members of the regiment against this. As a result, the regiment has been disbanded and the members sent to new companies/battalions being created within the \"Lyut\" Brigade (one of the largest, and largely made up of volunteer policemen). Those who refuse will be fired as policemen and are going to receive a subpoena to be mobilized into the UAF. This has met with much favor by the Ukrainian public opinion. Policemen are a not very popular category right now in Ukraine. Let\u2019s recall how in November it had been proposed to mobilize a part of them, but they managed to eliminate, for now, this measure. Before the war the Police wasn\u2019t a very popular branch (partly because of some issues of corruption and abuse of power) and now Ukrainians see that policemen who don\u2019t volunteer can sit quietly in the rear while civilians without military experience are mobilized. Personally, I, too, think it\u2019s time to start mobilizing policemen (and part of the State Emergency Service) and maybe replace the ranks with older men and women. The topic of mobilizing convicts is also addressed. The interviewee says he is willing to fight with those convicted of culpable and non-violent crimes but not with the others. In general, mobilization of convicts is an ongoing debate of growing importance in Ukraine, especially now that the voice most opposed to it (Zaluzhny) has been deposed. In an interview I heard last month, a Lt. Colonel from the 68th Jager Brigade emphasized the need for the use of convicts, on a voluntary basis, as stormtroopers or sappers, in penal units separated from the regular ones.",

Click the article for a discussion of it's capabilities that can be deduced from the visuals.\n\n[Our Best Look At Taiwan\u2019s First Homegrown Submarine | The Warzone | February 2024](https://www.twz.com/sea/our-best-look-at-taiwans-first-homegrown-submarine)\n\nThen the article goes into the discussion of the worth/value of the program which is an interesting topic.

My mind connects that Australia has 59, and Romania just signed a deal for 54, which they got the price cheaper by using older M1A1s. That&#39;s pure speculation, but the fact is there are several hundred owed to Poland, Taiwan, and Romania that these can be used for.</p>\n</div>",

Will Germany deliver it in 2023?\n\n> Germany is one of Ukraine's strongest supporters. We are supplying modern weapons such as the 2000 self-propelled howitzer, multiple rocket launchers, Gepard anti-aircraft tanks and the state-of-the-art Iris-T air defense system. We follow three clear principles in all of this: Firstly, we support Ukraine to the best of our ability. Secondly, we are preventing a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia. And, thirdly, Germany will not go it alone. That is the benchmark for our resolute yet prudent policy - and it will also apply next year. My impression is that the overwhelming majority of Germans think this is right.\n\n> What would have to happen in 2023 for Ukraine to get Western tanks after all?\n\n> In view of Russia's military failure, the danger of a further escalation of the war is great. We have driven a stake into the ground against nuclear escalation for the time being. It was important that China's President Xi also formulated this line during my visit to Beijing and that the G20 states reaffirmed this shortly afterwards. However, this has not stopped Putin from continuing the war with his attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure with relentless brutality. A clear violation of international law. Incidentally, I also made this point clear to Putin himself when I spoke to him on the phone. Russia must realize that this cannot continue. Putin must end the war, withdraw troops and thus create the opportunity for mutual understanding.\n\nAre we to assume that Scholz, in the last six months, changed his mind about escalation, then had the government conduct research on the details of transfering Taurus, which came to the conclusion that, unlike other, simple weapons systems like British and French cruise missiles, German howitzers and F16s, there is simply no way for the Ukrainians to operate this system independently? This would also mean that he arrived at this conclusion, but didn't share it with the head of the parliamentary defense council, who is still attacking him for his refusal to send Taurus.\n\nOr is he, as many of his ministers (and he himself during Cum-Ex with the help of Sch\u00e4uble) did previously, simply using \"classified reasons\" as a fig leaf for his personal decision? Let's also recall this tidbit:\n\n> SPD-Abgeordnete berichten, dass er vor kurzem bei einem Essen mit Fraktionsmitgliedern ge\u00e4ussert habe, solange er Kanzler sei, werde es keine Taurus-Lieferung geben.\n\n> SPD MPs report that he recently said at a dinner with members of his parliamentary group that as long as he was Chancellor, there would be no Taurus delivery.\n\n[Source](https://www.nzz.ch/international/taurus-debatte-im-bundestag-entlarvt-spd-als-bremser-bei-waffenhilfe-fuer-ukraine-ld.1817451)\n\nThis doesn't sound like him being willing to transfer the system, but simply being hampered by technological facts.\n\nMaybe Scholz wants to send Taurus, but there's simply no technological feasibility. Maybe he simply doesn't want to because he once again fears Russian escalation.",

This would also mean that he arrived at this conclusion, but didn&#39;t share it with the head of the parliamentary defense council, who is still attacking him for his refusal to send Taurus.</p>\n\n<p>Or is he, as many of his ministers (and he himself during Cum-Ex with the help of Sch\u00e4uble) did previously, simply using &quot;classified reasons&quot; as a fig leaf for his personal decision? Let&#39;s also recall this tidbit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>SPD-Abgeordnete berichten, dass er vor kurzem bei einem Essen mit Fraktionsmitgliedern ge\u00e4ussert habe, solange er Kanzler sei, werde es keine Taurus-Lieferung geben.</p>\n\n<p>SPD MPs report that he recently said at a dinner with members of his parliamentary group that as long as he was Chancellor, there would be no Taurus delivery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nzz.ch/international/taurus-debatte-im-bundestag-entlarvt-spd-als-bremser-bei-waffenhilfe-fuer-ukraine-ld.1817451\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>This doesn&#39;t sound like him being willing to transfer the system, but simply being hampered by technological facts.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Scholz wants to send Taurus, but there&#39;s simply no technological feasibility. Maybe he simply doesn&#39;t want to because he once again fears Russian escalation.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "This ended up being much longer than I anticipated, if you think it should be it's own main post let me know and I will submit it that way instead.  Sources are at the bottom.\n\nAfter the retirement of the battleships one of the Navy's admirals wanted the USN to design and build an \"Arsenal Ship\".  Basically a battleship with no radar, minimal crew, and MANY VLS cells.  Envisioned to follow around AEGIS-equipped destroyers/cruisers, it would act as cargo and launcher of a significant number of anti-air, surface-to-ground, and anti-ship missiles.\n\nHowever, as the years went on and that admiral retired, the USN believed it needed more ships, not fewer large ships to more effectively provide freedom of navigation for the world's seaways, leading to the development of the Freedom and Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).  These ships did not turn out the way the USN wanted and are now being retired/sold.  The other was adapting US subs to have VLS cells that can launch weapons like Tomahawks.\n\nWargames (lasting two weeks) were run by a non-government think tank that showed a conflict with China over Taiwan resulting in **some** scenarios losing a US Carrier Strike Group (USCSG) as well as USN and USAF losing many airframes over those two weeks (it didn't run beyond 2 weeks).  Despite what the media latched onto, one of the designers of the wargame was on a YT video (I think Ward Carrol?) talking about the different outcomes and the limitations the scenarios had.  Typically it didn't have \"China winning\" as much as in some scenarios the US had lost enough to greatly diminish US homogeny as a superpower, even though it left China very sore as well.\n\nThese results combined with internal assessments the US has rekindled its entire armed forces in preparation for a near-peer conflict because it is not just good enough to win a Taiwan/China scenario but **be able to dominate it so it never happens.**  \n\nThis includes new hypersonic weapons, large purchases of the B21 Raider (along with Australia), F15EXs (needing to replace F15Cs while F35 training occurs), etc as well as regional allies like Japan increasing their military budget significantly.  One of the big things the US has moved to in some of these programs like the F15EX (based on the export design for Qatar), the B21 (used many parts from existing aircraft and is under budget/time if inflation is accounted for) or FFG(X) (10 ships bought from Italian shipyards) is a focus on buying or slightly modifying existing systems to increase the number available units quickly rather than waiting years on development hell of pie in the sky dreams of tech.\n\nAnother issue the USN faced in the wargames was being able to change the logistics to be able to fight the war long term, the US lags behind significantly in container/supply ships and China's weapon capability could strike these while being able to operate closer to home.  The USMC has been going through a revamp to basically dig in on all these smaller islands around China and be able to fight without being resupplied and threatening Chinese naval efforts.\n\nThe two biggest issues are weapon/platform range and numbers.  Being close to home China can launch enough missiles to oversaturate the defense of Taiwan's SAM systems as well as a CSG.  With a well-coordinated and timed strike something will get through and losing any destroyer, cruiser, or carrier is a massive hit in capability, finances, prestige, and trained sailors.  \n\nThese strikes are only capable if the USCSG is within range of these weapons, but the USCSG needs to have weapons to strike back at these longer ranges to be effective, as mentioned before they are working on it as current carrier-based jets are just barely if at all able to work at these stand-off ranges, and even then the number of airframes lost from the wargames means over time their effectiveness of being able to fly sorties drops as well.\n\nOne of the proposals USN has is to take cargo ships and transform them into \"arsenal ships\", however, they would remain just as threatened as other US ships, but simply cheaper to build/make.  One idea that occurred to me while watching the conflict in Ukraine has been the use of semi-submersible drones.\n\nThey have reduced surface radar returns and are small/cheap enough to be used as weapon systems and have been effective at doing so (even though many of them get destroyed without hitting their target).  I do not think the USN has the necessity to design and build similar platforms, it is just not in the USN doctrine, there is perhaps a lesson learned to be had here.\n\nA VLS 4x cell is approximately 7x14x26 feet and has a maximum weight of 36k pounds.  While too big for the jet ski drones it isn't too big for the size of many ships.  If the USN were to design an autonomous simple semi-submersible ship with a few of these cells, it would give them the ability to get closer to the enemy to launch offensive or defensive weapons without putting other ships at risk.  It could slip in submerged under battery power, rise to charge, and wait for orders while being difficult to detect.\n\nThey would not be as useful or as difficult to detect as USN subs but could be significantly cheaper and more numerous.  Being small would mean more US or European shipyards could produce it without draining resources from the few (or 1 now?) US shipyards capable of producing large ships.  With being mostly autonomous would mean it should be cheap to maintain, simply have it sail back to a nearby port for refueling/maintenance, remove the cells, and put them in another ready-to-go.  No significant technologies need to be developed in order to design and build it.  It would help with the range and numbers of being able to counter an overwhelming launch from the Chinese mainland and reach of most of their missiles.\n\nThe other and perhaps more controversial idea would be for the USCSG to field tactical nuclear weapons on missile systems like the AIR2 Genie or Navy\u2019s Talos and Terrier missiles.  Currently, the F35 has been certified to drop the B61 nuclear weapon, but I don't know how quickly one could be fitted to an F35, get to altitude, and be used to stop large swarms of missiles.  Then it would also likely have to get approval from the POTUS when every second counts.  Tomahawks used to have a nuclear warhead but has since been retired.  No other weapon systems besides subs can I see the USN in possession of.\n\nTL;DR Semi-Submersible VLS drones and nuclear \"SM4\" anti-missile systems to counter Chinese mass attacks.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_ship\n\nhttps://www.defenseone.com/policy/2021/07/it-failed-miserably-after-wargaming-loss-joint-chiefs-are-overhauling-how-us-military-will-fight/184050/\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-17/b-21-bomber-delivers-pentagon-surprise-it-s-under-budget-so-far\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_F-15EX_Eagle_II\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22C3UA/\n\nhttps://www.defenseone.com/policy/2023/07/tanker-program-adds-9-ships-fuel-us-military-crisis/388924/ \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64294915\n\nhttps://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/january/converting-merchant-ships-missile-ships-win\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_41_Vertical_Launching_System\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2021/07/23/us-shipbuilding-is-at-its-lowest-ebb-ever-how-did-america-fall-so-far/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR-2_Genie\n\nhttps://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2020/august/tactical-nuclear-weapons-sea\n\nhttps://www.airandspaceforces.com/f-35-completes-final-test-for-nuclear-capable-b61-series-weapons/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)",

One of the big things the US has moved to in some of these programs like the F15EX (based on the export design for Qatar), the B21 (used many parts from existing aircraft and is under budget/time if inflation is accounted for) or FFG(X) (10 ships bought from Italian shipyards) is a focus on buying or slightly modifying existing systems to increase the number available units quickly rather than waiting years on development hell of pie in the sky dreams of tech.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue the USN faced in the wargames was being able to change the logistics to be able to fight the war long term, the US lags behind significantly in container/supply ships and China&#39;s weapon capability could strike these while being able to operate closer to home.  The USMC has been going through a revamp to basically dig in on all these smaller islands around China and be able to fight without being resupplied and threatening Chinese naval efforts.</p>\n\n<p>The two biggest issues are weapon/platform range and numbers.  Being close to home China can launch enough missiles to oversaturate the defense of Taiwan&#39;s SAM systems as well as a CSG.  With a well-coordinated and timed strike something will get through and losing any destroyer, cruiser, or carrier is a massive hit in capability, finances, prestige, and trained sailors.  </p>\n\n<p>These strikes are only capable if the USCSG is within range of these weapons, but the USCSG needs to have weapons to strike back at these longer ranges to be effective, as mentioned before they are working on it as current carrier-based jets are just barely if at all able to work at these stand-off ranges, and even then the number of airframes lost from the wargames means over time their effectiveness of being able to fly sorties drops as well.</p>\n\n<p>One of the proposals USN has is to take cargo ships and transform them into &quot;arsenal ships&quot;, however, they would remain just as threatened as other US ships, but simply cheaper to build/make.  One idea that occurred to me while watching the conflict in Ukraine has been the use of semi-submersible drones.</p>\n\n<p>They have reduced surface radar returns and are small/cheap enough to be used as weapon systems and have been effective at doing so (even though many of them get destroyed without hitting their target).  I do not think the USN has the necessity to design and build similar platforms, it is just not in the USN doctrine, there is perhaps a lesson learned to be had here.</p>\n\n<p>A VLS 4x cell is approximately 7x14x26 feet and has a maximum weight of 36k pounds.  While too big for the jet ski drones it isn&#39;t too big for the size of many ships.  If the USN were to design an autonomous simple semi-submersible ship with a few of these cells, it would give them the ability to get closer to the enemy to launch offensive or defensive weapons without putting other ships at risk.  It could slip in submerged under battery power, rise to charge, and wait for orders while being difficult to detect.</p>\n\n<p>They would not be as useful or as difficult to detect as USN subs but could be significantly cheaper and more numerous.  Being small would mean more US or European shipyards could produce it without draining resources from the few (or 1 now?) US shipyards capable of producing large ships.  With being mostly autonomous would mean it should be cheap to maintain, simply have it sail back to a nearby port for refueling/maintenance, remove the cells, and put them in another ready-to-go.  No significant technologies need to be developed in order to design and build it.  It would help with the range and numbers of being able to counter an overwhelming launch from the Chinese mainland and reach of most of their missiles.</p>\n\n<p>The other and perhaps more controversial idea would be for the USCSG to field tactical nuclear weapons on missile systems like the AIR2 Genie or Navy\u2019s Talos and Terrier missiles.  Currently, the F35 has been certified to drop the B61 nuclear weapon, but I don&#39;t know how quickly one could be fitted to an F35, get to altitude, and be used to stop large swarms of missiles.  Then it would also likely have to get approval from the POTUS when every second counts.  Tomahawks used to have a nuclear warhead but has since been retired.  No other weapon systems besides subs can I see the USN in possession of.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR Semi-Submersible VLS drones and nuclear &quot;SM4&quot; anti-missile systems to counter Chinese mass attacks.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_ship\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_ship</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2021/07/it-failed-miserably-after-wargaming-loss-joint-chiefs-are-overhauling-how-us-military-will-fight/184050/\">https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2021/07/it-failed-miserably-after-wargaming-loss-joint-chiefs-are-overhauling-how-us-military-will-fight/184050/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-17/b-21-bomber-delivers-pentagon-surprise-it-s-under-budget-so-far\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-17/b-21-bomber-delivers-pentagon-surprise-it-s-under-budget-so-far</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_F-15EX_Eagle_II\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_F-15EX_Eagle_II</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22C3UA/\">https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22C3UA/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2023/07/tanker-program-adds-9-ships-fuel-us-military-crisis/388924/\">https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2023/07/tanker-program-adds-9-ships-fuel-us-military-crisis/388924/</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64294915\">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64294915</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/january/converting-merchant-ships-missile-ships-win\">https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/january/converting-merchant-ships-missile-ships-win</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_41_Vertical_Launching_System\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_41_Vertical_Launching_System</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2021/07/23/us-shipbuilding-is-at-its-lowest-ebb-ever-how-did-america-fall-so-far/\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2021/07/23/us-shipbuilding-is-at-its-lowest-ebb-ever-how-did-america-fall-so-far/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR-2_Genie\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR-2_Genie</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2020/august/tactical-nuclear-weapons-sea\">https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2020/august/tactical-nuclear-weapons-sea</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.airandspaceforces.com/f-35-completes-final-test-for-nuclear-capable-b61-series-weapons/\">https://www.airandspaceforces.com/f-35-completes-final-test-for-nuclear-capable-b61-series-weapons/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)</a></p>\n</div>",

There are a lot of potential &quot;stop gaps&quot; available (like some of the ideas you are floating) but the situation is currently on track to likely get far worse, not better, and I just have a hard time seeing the US being able to reverse that and maintaining the dominance its used to without completely bankrupting the country in the process like the soviets did in their attempt to maintain parity during the cold war..  </p>\n\n<p>Phone is about to die, so apologize if response is a bit jumbled, will try to edit it later.</p>\n</div>",

And that is on top of the fact that Russian formations are organized from brigades into divisions and then into combined arms armies, all of which have integrated engineering support that they can and do call upon. \n\nConversely, the Ukrainians don't have formations above the brigade level and don't have a separate engineering corps. As a result, all they have to work with is brigade level engineer units who don't have the capability or training necessary to develop defensive lines comparable to the Russian ones. It's also unclear why exactly, but I wouldn't be surprised if those engineering units are already overtasked and/or underresourced as is, hence why even local Ukrainian defenses tend to be worse than their Russian counterparts. We know that Ukraine has repeatedly been forced to use specialized units, including engineering, as infantry since their losses have been so high, so perhaps that's part of the problem too as engineers are too busy manning foxholes to prepare extensive defensive networks. \n\nThis is all something that *could* be rectified, but just like mobilization, hasn't been. And the longer it doesn't get addressed, the worse things get for Ukraine. Proper defensive fortifications would shorten the frontlines AND require fewer men to garrison, while also reducing casualties and being more effective at slowing Russian advances. \n\nThis should have been a high priority for Ukraine years ago at this point, it's downright criminal it still isn't properly resourced.",

Both sides have held garbage ground routinely in this war simply because they gained a little bit of cover and concealment by digging into a treeline, while attacking it means crossing big ass open fields.</p>\n\n<p>But doing that means having the defenses built and manned in depth BEFORE retreating into them, at which point the defenders are like &quot;Oh crap, how come there are no defenses there.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And fun fact, regardless if you think there is no point of entrenching in the fields west of Avdiivka, the very fact that the Ukrainians are STILL TRYING TO HOLD THEM is why they&#39;re supposed to entrench. If they plan to defend, they should do it from prepared positions, not hasty dug positions. </p>\n\n<p>Again, the very real and serious threat of losing Avdiivka existed since last spring. The even more real and serious threat of losing Avdiivka existed since October. </p>\n\n<p>WHERE THE HELL IS THE DEFENSE IN DEPTH?</p>\n</div>",

He&#39;d already been running the joint US-Ukraine team &quot;Security Assistance Group Ukraine&quot; out of Germany, his entire job was responsible for all training and equipping of the Ukrainians, now he and his staff are finally allowed to go to Ukraine and set up an office there, which will at least improve coordination with the UAF general staff.</p>\n</div>",

And do you have to defend it?</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, you realize that the ideal way to generate fires is from the air as quickly as possible. But how do you bring that out to sea?</p>\n</div>",

You're right that the missiles and cyberattack mostly serve a similar purpose, but the cyberattack has the potential to maximize the \"surprise\" of a surprise attack.\n\nFor example, let's look at telecommunications. Cutting undersea cables cuts Taiwan off from the rest of the world, but internal Taiwanese communications remain operational. Missiles will strike various mobile phone towers, but not simultaneously, and the mobile network is resilient to individual losses, giving precious minutes for the civilian leadership to be in communication with the military leadership and authorise a military response to these obvious attacks. \n\nCompare that to the dream version of a cyberattack. There are no reported explosions that instantly put everyone on high alert. Your mobile phone just says your SIM needs to be reactivated, and your attempt to access your email results in a timeout. You assume it's a local error, meanwhile the rest of China's attack is commencing without a response, and those manning the Taiwanese anti-aircraft batteries haven't been given authorisation to do anything.\n\nSo to summarise, the advantage of a cyberattack is that it may not look like an attack in those vital first few minutes, and in theory it's capable of operating across the entire country simultaneously.\n\nOf course in reality cyberattacks may be massively overestimated. They've played no real meaningful role in the Ukraine conflict, where Russia would surely love to incapacitate Ukraine's infrastructure. But there's been a lot of ways that Russia has performed poorer than expected, so I wouldn't feel comfortable dismissing the concept of cyberattacks just because Russia couldn't pull it off.",
