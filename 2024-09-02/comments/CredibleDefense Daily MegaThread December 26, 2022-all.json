I mentioned the trains because it&#39;s approximately 10,000 km by rail to move all that ammunition too, but don&#39;t ask me how many 152 shells or 122mm rockets fit on a train.</p>\n</div>",

There are significant costs (and risks) to ammo storage and there are also expiration dates. The US is also relatively light (relative to its budget) on artillery since unlike Russia or Europe, it has to ship most of its ammo across an ocean. That's one reason the US has massed its huge stockpile of PGMs ([especially JDAMs](https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2008-09-18-Boeing-Delivers-200-000th-JDAM-Tailkit)). Another factor is that ammo production would increase far faster and greater if the US were actually at war. It would also be strange for the US to plan its procurement around a hypothetical large-scale conventional war in which it's not actually fighting, and the side it supports has limited naval or air assets. We can probably assume the US is sending artillery shells to Ukraine in a quantity that is somewhat sustainable, meaning they will continue to be sent, even if at a lower rate, and doesn't drop the US's readiness too much. Based on that, it seems US artillery stockpiles were sufficient to sustain a high intensity war in Europe or Asia before new production kicked in.",

In addition to damaging the pipeline, the explosion came perilously close to damaging a cable carrying electricity from Sweden to Poland. \u201cYou are sending a signal,\u201d said Martin Kragh, deputy director of the Stockholm Center for Eastern European Studies at the nonprofit Swedish Institute of International Affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s signaling \u2018We can do this, and we can do this elsewhere.\u2019\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the pipeline was not carrying gas at the time of the explosions has contributed to that speculation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are less certain that the primary aim was functional damage here, because the Nord Stream gas pipeline was not operational at the time,\u201d said Kjell Engelbrekt, who teaches political science at the Swedish Defense University.</p>\n\n<p>(The lack of gas at the time of the explosion also casts serious doubt on a theory that a bomb was sent through the pipe using an inspection device known as a PIG, or pipeline inspection gauge. \u201cNonsense,\u201d said Stephan Harmsen, who designed the PIG for Nord Stream I. Those devices require gas flow to operate, he said).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The counter battery fires on the defense line?

The rest still in Kyiv.\n\nI know one who has left to dodge via fake university invitation. Currently in Norway. (20yo).\n\n\nThere is one older person around 55 that is a family father who lives in a rather tiny village (on paper but actually in Kyiv) who has applied to be exempt for services and been denied. His whole family (6 children + wife) are in europe. Pretty sad. He served in the soviet army but has no interest in this war. He is still up to date been able to avoid service but has received multiple conscription letters and multiple times there were attempts to find him in the village.\n\nThe are about an endless number of young but also some 40ish year olds who I know who don't want to serve and where there was no serious attempt to get them to conscript or no attempt at all.\n\nAnd lastly I know quite a few who just have been legally exempt from service most of which went with family to Europe. \n\nI don't know anyone personally injured in this conflict besides someone who injured their arm in their apartment because of the blackouts. But sadly heard through acquaintances, instagram and friends a great number who actually did die. \n\nBonus:\nAll of the foreigners (around 25, all permanent residence in ukraine) I know left except for one who has had a new born baby.

They just need to be contained. That's what's going to happen if/when Ukraine is victorious.\n\nThink about it. What's left for Russia to take? Their plan was to grab Ukraine, and then Transnistria, and then probably eventually Moldova.\n\nBut that's not what's going to happen now. So let's take a look at the countries they border:\n\n* Azerbaijan\n\n* Belarus\n\n* China\n\n* Estonia\n\n* Finland\n\n* Georgia\n\n* Kazakhstan\n\n* North Korea\n\n* Latvia\n\n* Lithuania\n\n* Mongolia\n\n* Norway\n\n* Poland\n\n* Ukraine\n\nNow we take out China, North Korea, and NATO members/soon-to-be-members:\n\n* Azerbaijan\n\n* Belarus\n\n* Georgia\n\n* Kazakhstan\n\n* Mongolia\n\nThat's literally all the expansionists have to look forward to in the short term, unless they want a suicidal war with a great power. Once Ukraine is safe and integrated into NATO (along with Finland), we'll have done our part. After that, it's up to China to decide on whether or not they want Russia to expand up to their doorstep. \n\nWhat's next? Are they going to take Kazakhstan or Mongolia, and suddenly have to deal with a massively increased border with China? I doubt it. They've left Mongolia alone for at least this long as a buffer state, so they must think that that's in their best interest. Kazakhstan serves a similar function in that regard, except unlike Mongolia, they'd be a pain in the ass to actually take over- not to mention they're part of CSTO, and invading them would completely destroy any credibility Russia has left as an ally for generations to come.\n\nRussia could even go as far as trying to take over all the -stans between them and Afghanistan, but they have a population of 76 million and they're more ethnically diverse than Ukraine- it would be a complete mess. There's a reason the Soviet Union broke up along the lines that it did in the first place. Add to that the fact that they'd then share not only an incredibly huge border with China, but with Taliban-led Afghanistan... and, well, it doesn't seem particularly palatable.\n\nThe only obvious candidates, really, are Georgia and Azerbajian. They'll probably try to take Georgia over one day if we don't bring them into NATO, but we can't bring them into NATO unless they decide that they value NATO membership more than holding on to their claims to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. If they did take Georgia and Azerbaijan, there's a good chance they'd say \"To hell with CSTO\" and take Armenia at that point to get a nice, direct border with Iran, who they're apparently buddy-buddy with now.\n\nTL;DR they're running out of places that they would even want to take over. There's Georgia, maybe Azerbaijan, possibly Armenia. Taking Kazakhstan or Mongolia would lose them an important buffer state, to say nothing of the mess that would come from moving onto more -stans. The expansionists can be as radical as they want, but that won't change the reality of their lack of available real estate.",

Most people in China are adamantly opposed to allowing Taiwan, which was a part of China and which has been separated from the mainland because of the frozen civil war, to declare independence. This is one of the most explosive issues in Chinese politics, and directly challenging China on it is playing with fire.\n\nThat's why there has been a compromise over the last 50 years, in which almost every country in the world recognizes the PRC as China (instead of recognizing the ROC, aka \"Taiwan\"), and avoids any formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. Countries (including the PRC) conduct informal relations with Taiwan and trade with it, but they don't do anything that formally implies diplomatic recognition.\n\nA formal visit by the leader of the US Congress, who is also from the President's party, is seen in China as formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan as an independent state. That is a huge taboo in international politics, and it was done seemingly just to provoke China. The last time a Speaker of the House visited Taiwan was 25 years ago, and there were several mitigating factors: he was not from the President's party, he made a point of going to Beijing first, and the broader US-China relationship was very different.\n\nPelosi's visit came in the context of a number of other moves by the US that signal that it is abandoning the One China Policy: Trump's official call with Tsai Ing-Wen (the president of the ROC), the US' pressure to include Taiwan in international organizations that only sovereign states are allowed to join, Biden's repeated statements that the US will definitely militarily defend Taiwan, and the broader discussion in the US about embracing \"strategic clarity\" on Taiwan.\n\n> Wouldn't it be better to just ignore it?\n\nThe calculus in China is that if it ignores things like Pelosi's visit, then both the US and Taiwan will be emboldened to take further steps towards formal Taiwanese independence and diplomatic recognition. The Chinese leadership was also under huge pressure from domestic popular opinion to do something dramatic in response to Pelosi's visit (which goes to show how much of a powder keg this issue is, and why the One China Policy exists in the first place).",

If Japan bails and the Philippines align with China, the US would be in a bad spot. \n\nLet's assume the resupply mission comes from a coalition of the US, Japan, and Australia. The Philippines, India, Vietnam, South Korea, and most of Southeast Asia condemn the blockade but are unwilling to go directly to war with China. These selections are plausible, but semi-arbirtary, and directly shape the nature of the conflict.\n\nEven in this case, the US realistically can't achieve air superiority over Taiwan at the outset of the conflict. Even the might of US logistics likely can't move half it's air force around the world and keep a high enough sortie rate to overcome the proximity advantage that China has. Likewise, you don't send a carrier battle group against a well armed landmass in a conventional war. Even if Chinese carrier killer missiles are hype, the mainland is always going to sink the CVN before the CVN can sink the mainland. \n\nSo then what are the coalition's options? The logical choice to me is long distance blockade combined with surgical airstrikes to try to break the back of the Chinese economy before they break Taiwan. China almost entirely lacks the ability to project it's naval power outside the first island chain. It also has an economy driven by imports and exports, is a net importer of oil, and has a massive population that's more or less food insecure.\n\nThe UK set a similar precident during WW1, setting a long distance blockade on Germany. Neutral ships could proceed to German ports, but only after stopping in the UK and passing as inspection. Sinking a single cargo ship would likely be enough to halt the majority of international trade to China. Chinese escalatory options are limited here. They'd likely send their sub fleet to do similar to the US. If they are smart, they keep their carriers in port as venturing out last the first island chain likely results in a decisive naval defeat. We probably see limited naval battles in sea lanes all over the globe as Chinese subs duke it out with coalition merchant marine escort ships and vice versa.\n\nWhile all of that is going on, the US would likely be striking critical targets on China's periphery with it's stealth assets and cruise missile submarines. How effective this is depends heavily on how far into rollout the B-21 is and the range of our low observable munitions.\n\nThe heaviest fighting likely happens over the Sea of Japan. Chinese missle salvos and aircraft sorties would become a normal thing over Japan as China seeks to break Japanese resolve and deny the US a forward operating base. We likely see air battles on the same order of magnitude as the Battle of Britain.\n\nThis conflict probably goes on until the resolve of one side is broken. Can the US slow down the Chinese military industrial complex before it outbuild them? Will the American people be okay with the economic implications and possible strikes on the US for the first time in recent history? Would Europe take a side? Would Japan have the resolve to stay the course through missiles reigning down? All of that is TBD.\n\nThe one thing we can be certain of is that a war of this kind would devastate the world economy, and likely set back globalism by decades. China likely doesn't emerge from the conflict as a viable trade partner for the West, and the US stands to lose it's geopolitcal and economic standing. Manufacturing's economic center would probably shift away from East Asia. The world also risks nuclear war. \n\nGenerally, nobody emerges from this conflict a winner. This is exactly the thing that has dissuaded China from attacking Taiwan before now. Keeping the stakes high is probably the best way to prevent this conflict in the future.",

His first book, \u201cA World Restored\u201d (1957), laid out some basic ideas that dominate his thinking to this day. Mr. Kissinger believes that only a handful of people at any given time understand the complicated architecture of a viable world order, and that an even smaller number have the gifts of leadership required to create, defend or reform the delicate international framework that makes even partial peace possible.\n\n>Worse, it is not enough for an effective leader to understand the international system. Mr. Kissinger believes that there is an immense gap between the kind of world the citizens of any given country want to see and the kind of world that is actually possible. The world can\u2019t be as Sinocentric as Chinese public opinion wants it to be, as democratic or woke as many Americans would like, as Islamic as many Muslims would wish, as responsive to development concerns as some African and Latin American countries want, or as awed by French grandeur or admiring of British moral leadership as people in those countries want.\n\n>Great leaders must bridge the gap between public opinion in their own countries and the compromises inseparable from international diplomacy. They must see the world clearly enough to understand what is possible and sustainable, and they must be able to persuade their fellow citizens to accept outcomes that are, inevitably, often disappointing. Paradoxically, this task is often harder in a powerful state such as America, which is often able to get much of what it wants in the world. Small and weak countries understand the need for compromise; great and powerful ones often think they can have it all.\n\n>This kind of leadership involves a rare mix of intellectual ability, deep education and the kind of intuitive understanding of politics given to few. Mr. Kissinger\u2019s most recent book, \u201cLeadership: Six Studies in World Strategy,\u201d singles out six leaders (Germany\u2019s Konrad Adenauer, France\u2019s Charles de Gaulle, America\u2019s Richard Nixon, Egypt\u2019s Anwar Sadat, Britain\u2019s Margaret Thatcher and Singapore\u2019s Lee Kuan Yew) who achieved great things at home and abroad. But the book looks forward, not back. As Mr. Kissinger emphasized at our lunch, he fears that the exceptional conditions that enabled these leaders to appear may be fading away.\n\n>The six leaders Mr. Kissinger profiled were all born outside the social elite. They were middle-class children from ordinary families. That background gave them an ability to understand how their fellow citizens saw the world. Selected into meritocratic educational institutions, they received a disciplined and demanding education that prepared them psychologically, intellectually and culturally to operate effectively at the highest levels of national and international life.\n\n>A question that troubles Mr. Kissinger is whether this pipeline is breaking down\u2014whether elite institutions no longer offer this rigor and discipline, and whether the culture of \u201cdeep literacy,\u201d as he calls it, has eroded to the point where society no longer has the wisdom necessary to prepare new generations for leadership.\n\n>This isn\u2019t merely about woke college professors dumbing education down or superficial left-wing ideologues driving complex and subtle ideas out of university teaching. It\u2019s about whether the depth and rigor of classic scholarship can withstand the challenge of the more visual culture and the shorter attention spans promoted by electronic media.\n\n>Now in his 100th year, Mr. Kissinger has been pondering the problems of leadership for longer than most Americans have been alive. When he entered public life in the 1960s, the old WASP elite still dominated the field of American foreign policy. But the old Brahmins like the Achesons, Bundys and Alsops, who brought America both the Marshall Plan and the Vietnam War, faded away. The Nixon, Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations achieved important successes, but the 21st-century track record of American statecraft is less inspiring.\n\n>Today, Mr. Kissinger warns, the problem of world order is growing harder. Great-power rivalries intensify, China is a more complex challenge than the Soviet Union ever was, and international trust diminishes as the potential for global conflict steadily grows. We need wisdom more than ever, Mr. Kissinger says, but it is not so easy to find.\n\n>It is hard to disagree. American debates today, over domestic as well as foreign policy, often feature a sterile competition between technocrats immersed in conventional groupthink on the one side and populist demagogues armed with superficial slogans on the other.
