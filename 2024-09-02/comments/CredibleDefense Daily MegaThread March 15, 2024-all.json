        "body": "A new article just came out about the Taurus debate in Germany with new technical details, deliberations and why Scholz is against delivery. New discussion sparked this week because Scholz refered to secret knowledge in his Bundestag speech about the Taurus and why a delivery is not possible. It's a long article, so use your own translator if you want but I'll post the interesting highlights down below.\n\nhttps://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/deutschland/militaer-verteidigung/id_100364946/taurus-debatte-warum-olaf-scholz-wirklich-keine-marschflugkoerper-liefert.html\n\n> What secret knowledge is the Chancellor referring to?\n\n>Essentially, Scholz is concerned with retaining control over the targeting of the cruise missile, which can fly over 500 kilometers and thus - theoretically - as far as Moscow. In order to maintain control, German soldiers would have to be involved, which is why delivery of the Taurus is ruled out. \"That's a line I don't want to cross as Chancellor,\" Scholz said on Wednesday, reiterating his \"no\". ........ However, the reference to Germany's control is apparently only part of the truth. According to information from t-online, there is another important factor that plays a role in the chancellor's Taurus-No. By accusing R\u00f6ttgen of possessing some kind of secret knowledge, Scholz himself has hinted at what might be involved. It concerns classified information that has now been made available to selected members of the Bundestag for the first time.\n\nA presentation by the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Carsten Breuer given to members of the defense commitee follows and contains new details:\n\n\n> What did Breuer say?\n\n>The Inspector General apparently informed the MPs in detail that the deployment of the Taurus is more complicated than many had previously assumed. In order to use the cruise missile effectively, an **enormous amount of data** is required.\n\n>It was already known that the target programming of the Taurus weapons is complicated. **The \"central mission planning\" (ZMP), the technical and operational procedure for target input and route guidance, consists of numerous different source data such as altitude measurement points, vector data, satellite images and raster maps in order to enable the Taurus to fly the most precise route possible.** The ZMP system was developed by the German company ESG, which was merged into the defense electronics company Hensoldt at the end of 2023.\n\n>**These are not gigabytes or terabytes, but extremely large and complex amounts of data that apparently have to be processed by special technical systems.** However, these technical systems are **only available to a limited extent**, it is said. If these were also transferred to Ukraine in the event of a Taurus delivery, they would no longer be available to the Bundeswehr. According to a person familiar with the matter, this would create a capability gap **that would severely impair the \"operational capability of the German armed forces\".**\n\n>It is unclear what kind of systems are involved. Neither the Taurus manufacturer MBDA nor the Federal Ministry of Defense would comment when asked. It is also unclear how many of these systems are available, how long it will take to replace them and why they are so difficult to procure. According to a person familiar with the matter, it is a \"technical bottleneck\" that cannot be replaced for a long time. \"If we deliver this capability, it will no longer exist for us.\"\n\n>The situation is not comparable to the handover of the 18 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, for example, which the army will have to wait until 2026 to replace. **\"The Taurus is one of our most powerful weapons in the air-to-ground area, almost approaching strategic capabilities.\" According to a person familiar with the matter, it is a matter of \"fundamental questions of national security\".** In Breuer's presentation, the MPs were given a \"price tag\" for the security of the Federal Republic of Germany, which everyone involved must now be aware of.\n\nThen the article repeats that the Taurus can work without this data, but in a less accurated mode:\n\n>A decisive factor here is obviously how the Taurus is used: in its \"slimmed-down\", data-poorer version or in its intended form with all the additional features. If the Taurus plays to all its advantages, it can, for example, descend to a low altitude of up to 15 meters, where it can better fly around or under enemy air defences.\n\n>However, it is said that this precise navigation using four different systems and the modeling of the route and the exact target (accurate to within a few meters) requires the aforementioned systems.\n\n>The **Taurus could be sent to Ukraine without any additional capability, including a shorter training period for Ukrainian soldiers. However, the Taurus would then serve more as a supply for the less powerful British Storm Shadow cruise missiles. Both variants are possible, with their respective advantages and disadvantages.**\n\nComplex mission planning:\n\n>References to the complex mission planning as well as the different uses of the Taurus can also be found in the leaked conversation between high-ranking air force officers. A lieutenant colonel, for example, speaks of \"target data that ideally comes from satellite images\", because this allows the highest precision, namely below three meters, to be achieved. \"We have to process the [target data] in the first set in B\u00fcchel\", where the air force maintains an airbase.\n\n>Elsewhere, the officer explains that **the calculation time for the modeling doubles to twelve hours if the more precise satellite data is fed in, and that this requires a data line \"that can handle it\".**\n\nArticle ends with speculation about Ukraine losing the war and Germany losing the Taurus capability, which imo is a weak argument:\n\n>Is Germany defenceless without Taurus?\nThe information given to MPs at the committee meeting on Tuesday had little visible effect on the subsequent debate in the Bundestag and the vote on the Union's motion.\n\n>Nevertheless, they can shed more light on the Chancellor's calculation as to why he insists on his veto. **For example, when it comes to a worst-case scenario: if Scholz hands over part of the Taurus including technical equipment to Ukraine and Ukraine loses the war, Russia could be standing on the NATO border in western Ukraine while Germany has given up a core military capability. A \"lose-lose\" situation.**\n\n>As a result, Germany would be even weaker militarily than before. The Chancellor would be responsible for this. Since the Taurus systems are not game changers, as is now being emphasized from all sides, but would only bring tactical advantages, Scholz could think to himself: Why deliver a weapon that is not decisive for the war in Ukraine, but means a massive impairment of Germany's own deterrence capability?\n\n>Ultimately, it remains a political question. The hurdles to a delivery could be removed. Germany could also send the Taurus to Ukraine in the \"premium version\" and accept the risk to its own security. The CDU/CSU, Greens and FDP, who were also present at the committee meeting, are apparently prepared to accept this risk.\n\n>If you follow the argumentation of the strongest Taurus supporters, this also makes sense: if the thesis is that Ukraine is also defending Germany's security from the Russians, then giving up a military core capability may be justifiable.\n\n. \n\n.\n\nSo in essence it boils down to this: To really use Taurus to its full potential it needs huge amounts of Data. You could send German troops to programm these things in Ukraine (and make sure Ukraine doesnt use them against Moscow) but thats out of the question for Scholz. So then you need to train the Ukrainians to do it themselfs which takes alot of time and the question is still if and how we can give them time sensitive data for strike missions. You could skip all this and use Taurus in \"dumb\" mode but the argument is that it's kind of a waste then? Also Germany has not alot of ZMP modules to programm the Taurus which should probably be addressed.",

            "body": "> Nevertheless, they can shed more light on the Chancellor's calculation as to why he insists on his veto. For example, when it comes to a worst-case scenario: if Scholz hands over part of the Taurus including technical equipment to Ukraine and Ukraine loses the war, Russia could be standing on the NATO border in western Ukraine while Germany has given up a core military capability. A \"lose-lose\" situation.\n> \n> As a result, Germany would be even weaker militarily than before. The Chancellor would be responsible for this. Since the Taurus systems are not game changers, as is now being emphasized from all sides, but would only bring tactical advantages, Scholz could think to himself: Why deliver a weapon that is not decisive for the war in Ukraine, but means a massive impairment of Germany's own deterrence capability?\n\nThis whole line of reasoning just seems so suspect. Does Germany expect Ukraine to completely fall at this point? That seems wildly unrealistic given the situation on the ground and both side's relative capability. But even if it were on the cards, is Russian occupied Kyiv a *better* prospect than giving the missiles? Wouldn't winning the war by any means make Germany *safer* in that case? \n\nAnd then in the next paragraph the downplaying of Taurus' capabilities. If theyre not going to be a game changer for Ukraine, why will they be a game changer for Germany? Because they can, with apparently great effort by a small number of highly trained specialists, reduce the CPE by half? Until that group is killed in an they turn into worthless missiles?

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, they can shed more light on the Chancellor&#39;s calculation as to why he insists on his veto. For example, when it comes to a worst-case scenario: if Scholz hands over part of the Taurus including technical equipment to Ukraine and Ukraine loses the war, Russia could be standing on the NATO border in western Ukraine while Germany has given up a core military capability. A &quot;lose-lose&quot; situation.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, Germany would be even weaker militarily than before. The Chancellor would be responsible for this. Since the Taurus systems are not game changers, as is now being emphasized from all sides, but would only bring tactical advantages, Scholz could think to himself: Why deliver a weapon that is not decisive for the war in Ukraine, but means a massive impairment of Germany&#39;s own deterrence capability?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This whole line of reasoning just seems so suspect. Does Germany expect Ukraine to completely fall at this point? That seems wildly unrealistic given the situation on the ground and both side&#39;s relative capability. But even if it were on the cards, is Russian occupied Kyiv a <em>better</em> prospect than giving the missiles? Wouldn&#39;t winning the war by any means make Germany <em>safer</em> in that case? </p>\n\n<p>And then in the next paragraph the downplaying of Taurus&#39; capabilities. If theyre not going to be a game changer for Ukraine, why will they be a game changer for Germany? Because they can, with apparently great effort by a small number of highly trained specialists, reduce the CPE by half? Until that group is killed in an they turn into worthless missiles?
