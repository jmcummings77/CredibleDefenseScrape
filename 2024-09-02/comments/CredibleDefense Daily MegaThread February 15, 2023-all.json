Despite the increased numbers, Western allies have not seen evidence of sufficient changes to those forces\u2019 ability to carry out combined arms operations needed to take and hold new territory.\n\n>>\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely Russian forces will be particularly better organized and so unlikely they\u2019ll be particularly more successful, though they do seem willing to send more troops into the meat grinder,\u201d a senior British official told CNN.\n\n>The US military had assessed it would take as long as until May for the Russian military to regenerate enough power for a sustained offensive, but Russian leaders wanted action sooner. The US now sees it as likely that Russian forces are moving before they are ready due to political pressure from the Kremlin, the senior US military official told CNN.\n\n>Though Ukrainian officials have been sounding the alarm about new Russian attacks in the East, there is also skepticism on the Ukrainian side about Russian capabilities as those forces currently stand.\n\n>>\u201cThey amassed enough manpower to take one or two small cities in Donbas, but that\u2019s it,\u201d a senior Ukrainian diplomat told CNN. \u201cUnderwhelming, compared to the sense of panic they were trying to build in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n>As the war approaches its first anniversary later this month, Ukraine has kept the pressure on Western leaders to provide more advanced and longer-range weaponry to defend and fight back against Russia. In January, the US, Britain, and Germany agreed to send modern battle tanks, but now Ukraine is pushing for fighter jets and long-range missiles.\n\n>Earlier this month Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that \u201cRussia is now concentrating its forces and preparing for an attempt at revenge not only against Ukraine, but also against free Europe and the free world.\u201d\n\n>He has said he believed a new Russian offensive \u2013 predicted by his commanders in interviews in December \u2013 had already started.\n\n>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday in Brussels that the US is not seeing Russia \u201cmassing its aircraft\u201d ahead of an aerial operation against Ukraine.\n\n>\u201cIn terms of whether or not Russia is massing its aircraft for some massive aerial attack, we don\u2019t currently see that.

Russia failed to gain air superiority over Ukraine and relied mainly on stand-off attacks using its land-attack cruise missiles, depleting its inventory. As a consequence, Moscow has turned to importing Iranian direct-attack munitions. In turn, this is driving closer defence-industrial cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. Russia\u2019s tank and artillery fleets have suffered significant attrition. Around 50% of its pre-war fleet of modern T-72B3s and T-72B3Ms is assessed to have been lost. Moreover, the composition of Russia\u2019s inventory has changed. As modern vehicles have been destroyed, Russia has looked to maintain its fleet by bringing older vehicles out of store. The war is finally driving out of many East European inventories the Soviet-era equipment that many states have retained since the end of the Cold War.

Indeed, the strategic centre of gravity in Europe has moved further north and east: Germany announced a special EUR100 billion (USD106bn) fund for defence and, like Poland and Finland, joined the group of European nations ordering from the United States the fifth-generation F-35 combat aircraft.

Russia failed to gain air superiority over Ukraine and relied mainly on stand-off attacks using its land-attack cruise missiles, depleting its inventory. As a consequence, Moscow has turned to importing Iranian direct-attack munitions. In turn, this is driving closer defence-industrial cooperation between Moscow and Tehran.

                            "body": "For DMs, it would be nice. For the average Soldier it's a total waste.\n\nPut it this way, the standard Army qualification course, whose scores were so low it helped spurn the desire by dumb shit generals trying to buy better marksmanship. That  course of fire uses a 5.56 rifle zeroed at 300 meters, with targets between 25\" and 40\" tall, with no more than 8\" of rise at the height of the bullet's max ordinate, with targets between the 25 meter and 300 meter. What that means is the shooter only needs to aim center mass and assuming they hold a bit to compensate for wind they should hit every target with ease. After all, it's not like they need to factor in anything regarding external ballistics, there are ZERO sight adjustment necessary, that's the whole point of that course of fire. And yet the Army finds itself struggling to get Soldiers just to qualify, let alone shoot expert. And that includes combat arms too, a scary amount have no idea what they're doing and most of their NCOs know jack and shit with it comes to marksmanship instruction.\n\nSwitch to the Marine Corps, whose qualification has individuals firing at known distances, so they don't need a laser range finder to tell them the range out to 500 yd or meters (Oki range is in meters out to 500). They even have range flags that tell them wind in MPH that translate to sight adjustment info in their databooks. Why is it actually quite hard to shoot expert? \n\nWhy can't more shoot expert despite range estimation not being an issue?

For the average Soldier it&#39;s a total waste.</p>\n\n<p>Put it this way, the standard Army qualification course, whose scores were so low it helped spurn the desire by dumb shit generals trying to buy better marksmanship. That  course of fire uses a 5.56 rifle zeroed at 300 meters, with targets between 25&quot; and 40&quot; tall, with no more than 8&quot; of rise at the height of the bullet&#39;s max ordinate, with targets between the 25 meter and 300 meter. What that means is the shooter only needs to aim center mass and assuming they hold a bit to compensate for wind they should hit every target with ease. After all, it&#39;s not like they need to factor in anything regarding external ballistics, there are ZERO sight adjustment necessary, that&#39;s the whole point of that course of fire. And yet the Army finds itself struggling to get Soldiers just to qualify, let alone shoot expert. And that includes combat arms too, a scary amount have no idea what they&#39;re doing and most of their NCOs know jack and shit with it comes to marksmanship instruction.</p>\n\n<p>Switch to the Marine Corps, whose qualification has individuals firing at known distances, so they don&#39;t need a laser range finder to tell them the range out to 500 yd or meters (Oki range is in meters out to 500). They even have range flags that tell them wind in MPH that translate to sight adjustment info in their databooks. Why is it actually quite hard to shoot expert? </p>\n\n<p>Why can&#39;t more shoot expert despite range estimation not being an issue? Because they don&#39;t know how to build solid shooting positions, they don&#39;t know how to establish natural point of aim, how to breath, how trigger control actually works, how follow through works, etc. Because good shooting is more than just knowing external ballistics.</p>\n\n<p>So now give the average grunt that $10k scope, what can they do with it?

A few units here and there did it right but most didn't, the concept was set up for failure.\n\nThe problem starts with that it's a position within the rifle squad meant to be filled by a junior enlisted member. Which one? Technically it's supposed to go to the best shot in the squad, but that's rarely one of the junior enlisted (team and squad leaders have far more trigger time), plus it's technically one of the two rifleman positions meant for the two most junior soldiers. In seniority, a fire team goes team leader, SAW gunner, grenadier, rifleman, with the latter often left open when the team isn't at 100% strength.\n\nThen comes training. The DMs role is long range precision marksmanship, supposed to accurately hit targets at 300-600 meter range to compliment the SAW but beyond what rifleman with M16/M4 are trained to perform. But who in the Big Army infantry platoon know how to shoot that far? Not most NCOs and definitely not the officers, they're barely competent training their subordinates to hit targets out to 300 meters (with the advice on the qualification range to not shoot at the 300 meter targets to save ammo for shooting at closer targets they miss). So who trains and mentors DMs? The Army doesn't really know. Some got members of the Army Marksmanship Training Unit, the Army's shooting team, to come out and do 1-2 week training courses that were mediocre at best. Others used their battalion sniper section to train DMs. But it was never standardized, there is no Army school for it, etc. \n\nLet's say the DM gets good training when taking over the position. How often will they more? Rarely, because the Army doesn't focus on long distance marksmanship training. So other than unit level sustainment training for DMs, they're probably not getting much. And like other weapons within the rifle squad, as soon as they become the least bit proficient, the platoon leadership in their infinite wisdom will likely move them to another position (nobody stays in one job within a fireteam that long). \n\nThen the issue became equipment. What is a designated marksmen rifle? Realistically, take an M4A1, an ACOG, and a bipod, add a better trigger, maybe slap on a free float rail, and that's definitely good enough for 600 meters, assuming they also get a laser range finder (or just learn how to range using the ACOG) and all requisite training. But then in the infinite wisdom of the Army they mass issued the M14 EBR during the GWOT because somebody with no marksmanship background thought it was a good rifle. Not only was nobody in the Army trained on that weapon system, not having a clue how to use it (a problem for team and squad leaders who have to ensure their DM private is using it properly), but the armorers weren't trained on them either, there were almost no spare parts in the system, extra magazines, etc. Going to the M110A1 was a smarter move, it's enough like the M4 that at least NCOs can help with basic manipulation and cleaning. If everyone gets the XM5 at least the TL and SL will know them.\n\nLastly, doctrine. Within a few field manuals there are mentions that a DM role exists with a very brief explanation of what they do. But there is almost nothing within the doctrine that goes over tactics in great detail on how to use them. Which team are they supposed to be in? What's their role in various battle drills? How are they supposed to be used in conjunction with a defense? All of these are described in detail for other weapons in the rifle squad, the SAW and grenade launcher and even AT4 when carried. But nothing for the DM. Likewise, team, squad, and platoon leaders don't really know how to use them anymore than they know how to train them. \n\nAnd now the Army thinks they're mass producing DMs just by buying every rifleman a AR-10 chambered in a shortened 270 Weatherby Magnum cartridge using the most complex weapon sight ever issued, all as a package so they don't need to train them, which is the prevailing mindset for those who made this decision. \n\nGo read the various press releases made over the years for NGSW and you'll find repeated references to M1 Abrams main gun and fire control system, because in the minds of the colonels and generals pushing and running this program that was the entire point. A high pressure rifle with a trajectory they describe as a laser beam, with overmatch penetration capabilities, that can do what an M1 Abrams fire control system can do to guarantee first round hits even at long ranges.\n\nBut they forgot that the M1 Abrams can only do that because when the gunner breathes, the cannon barrel doesn't move. When the driver is moving the tank, the barrel doesn't move because it's mechanically stabilized. As far back as WW1 tank guns were stabilized with hydraulics and gears so they don't shake, wobble or bounce when stationary. None of those can be duplicated with XM5/XM157, and it's those things that cause most misses, not range estimation errors.",

A few units here and there did it right but most didn&#39;t, the concept was set up for failure.</p>\n\n<p>The problem starts with that it&#39;s a position within the rifle squad meant to be filled by a junior enlisted member. Which one? Technically it&#39;s supposed to go to the best shot in the squad, but that&#39;s rarely one of the junior enlisted (team and squad leaders have far more trigger time), plus it&#39;s technically one of the two rifleman positions meant for the two most junior soldiers. In seniority, a fire team goes team leader, SAW gunner, grenadier, rifleman, with the latter often left open when the team isn&#39;t at 100% strength.</p>\n\n<p>Then comes training. The DMs role is long range precision marksmanship, supposed to accurately hit targets at 300-600 meter range to compliment the SAW but beyond what rifleman with M16/M4 are trained to perform. But who in the Big Army infantry platoon know how to shoot that far? Not most NCOs and definitely not the officers, they&#39;re barely competent training their subordinates to hit targets out to 300 meters (with the advice on the qualification range to not shoot at the 300 meter targets to save ammo for shooting at closer targets they miss). So who trains and mentors DMs? The Army doesn&#39;t really know.

The battery FDC are the ones managing all that so the gun crews can just focus on their simpler tasks that are still not that easy to perform.\n\nThat, because that isn't the case\n\n> Verify the AFATDS database. Verify targets meet target selection standards and attack guidance. So what are you talking about?\n\nActually that isn't the full list\n\nHere is the full list, with all automizable tasks marked:\n\n- Verify the AFATDS database. <THIS\r\n- Verify targets meet target selection standards and attack guidance.\r\n- Issuing a fire order.\r\n- Determine accurate and timely firing data. <THIS\r\n- Verify maintenance checks on the section vehicle, radios, computer, and generators in strict\r\ncompliance with applicable technical manuals.\r\n- Verify that the tactical situation map is current.\r\n- Verify accuracy of records of missions fired.\r\n- Verify dissemination and understanding of data for prearranged fires. <THIS\r\n- Verify that data from the other platoon is recorded and accessible.\r\n- Supervise assumption of control of the fires from the other platoon.\r\n- Perform independent safety computations. <THIS\r\n- Maintain muzzle velocity variance information for all howitzers. <THIS\r\n- Control howitzer movement and positioning.\r\n- Issue movement orders based on commander, platoon leader, and advance party guidance.\n\nThere's also the fire control sergeant, his duties include:\n\n- Supervise creation and updates applied to the AFATDS database. <THIS\r\n- Supervise safe, accurate, and timely computation of firing data. <THIS\r\n- Ensure section crew drills are adhered to in accordance with appropriate FMs, standard operating\r\nprocedures, and regulations.\r\n- Ensure appropriate records are maintained.<THIS, probably\r\n- Verify preventive maintenance checks and services on section vehicles and equipment.\r\n- Ensure required reports are accurate, and submitted in accordance with standard operating\r\nprocedures.\r\n\nAlso:\n\n>Although howitzer automation systems may update muzzle velocities when the variations meet a certain threshold, the fire direction officer must request an update to the muzzle velocity variations, verify, and apply the changes to the AFATDS.\n\nThis could be done automatically too\n\n...but yeah, much of what the officers do is important and cannot be automated, their work is necessary.\n\nWhat about the other 3 FDC staffmembers per FDC? I wonder what their job is.\n\n>[(3) Fire direction computer operator. The fire direction computer operator operates the primary means of computing firing data. He determines and announces fire commands. He also records mission-related data and other information as directed. The equivalent USMC billet description is operations assistant. There is an operations assistant in both the FDC and the BOC.](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/Ch2.htm)\n\n>[(4) Fire direction specialist. There are two fire direction specialists per FDC to facilitate 24-hour operations. In a manual FDC, they serve alternately as horizontal control operator (HCO) and vertical control operator (VCO). The equivalent USMC billet description is fire control man.](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/Ch2.htm)\n\n>[There are five fire control men in a USMC FDC and three more in a BOC to facilitate 24-hour operations. These fire control men may perform the duties of the HCO, VCO, radio operator, or driver as needed in either the FDC or BOC. \n(a) The HCO constructs and maintains the primary firing chart and determines and announces chart data. \n(b) The VCO constructs the secondary firing chart checks chart data, plots initial target location on the situation map, and determines and announces site.\n(c) The radiotelephone operator (RATELO) or driver is normally the operator of the FDC vehicle. He maintains the vehicle and the FDC-associated generators. In a manual FDC, he may also act as the recorder.](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/Ch2.htm)\n\nAgain, the main purpose of an FDC is still to be \"the primary fire control facility for the cannon battery.\" These tasks could be very easily automated. The only fire-control staff task that cannot be done by a sufficiently powerful onboard computer is:\n\n>During some types of degraded howitzer operations, the battery or platoon FDC may assume direct control of technical fire direction and send firing data to the howitzer. For example, if the digital control system of an individual howitzer section is degraded or inoperative, the FDC may compute technical firing data for that section.\n\nHowever, that is an extremely unlikely circumstance. If the fire control system - which is located deep within the howitzer - is degraded, then it is most likely the case that the entire howitzer is inoperable. Even if by some miracle the howitzer would survive such a disabling hit, using a nearby howitzer's FCS is still preferable.\r\n\n>Note: The preferred method requires an operational howitzer to locate next to the degraded howitzer and the degraded howitzer uses the operational howitzer\u2019s firing data.\n\n-ATP 3-09.50",
                                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>So say a battery of M109 is normally supporting 2nd Tank Battalion, who have fifteen calls for fire requests processing, meanwhile the arty battery&#39;s higher level battalion FDC has drones up that are finding targets that suddenly become priority for the battery. The battery FDC are the ones managing all that so the gun crews can just focus on their simpler tasks that are still not that easy to perform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That, because that isn&#39;t the case</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Verify the AFATDS database. Verify targets meet target selection standards and attack guidance. So what are you talking about?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Actually that isn&#39;t the full list</p>\n\n<p>Here is the full list, with all automizable tasks marked:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Verify the AFATDS database. &lt;THIS</li>\n<li>Verify targets meet target selection standards and attack guidance.</li>\n<li>Issuing a fire order.</li>\n<li>Determine accurate and timely firing data. &lt;THIS</li>\n<li>Verify maintenance checks on the section vehicle, radios, computer, and generators in strict\ncompliance with applicable technical manuals.</li>\n<li>Verify that the tactical situation map is current.</li>\n<li>Verify accuracy of records of missions fired.</li>\n<li>Verify dissemination and understanding of data for prearranged fires. &lt;THIS</li>\n<li>Verify that data from the other platoon is recorded and accessible.</li>\n<li>Supervise assumption of control of the fires from the other platoon.</li>\n<li>Perform independent safety computations. &lt;THIS</li>\n<li>Maintain muzzle velocity variance information for all howitzers. &lt;THIS</li>\n<li>Control howitzer movement and positioning.</li>\n<li>Issue movement orders based on commander, platoon leader, and advance party guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also the fire control sergeant, his duties include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supervise creation and updates applied to the AFATDS database. &lt;THIS</li>\n<li>Supervise safe, accurate, and timely computation of firing data. &lt;THIS</li>\n<li>Ensure section crew drills are adhered to in accordance with appropriate FMs, standard operating\nprocedures, and regulations.</li>\n<li>Ensure appropriate records are maintained.&lt;THIS, probably</li>\n<li>Verify preventive maintenance checks and services on section vehicles and equipment.</li>\n<li>Ensure required reports are accurate, and submitted in accordance with standard operating\nprocedures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although howitzer automation systems may update muzzle velocities when the variations meet a certain threshold, the fire direction officer must request an update to the muzzle velocity variations, verify, and apply the changes to the AFATDS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be done automatically too</p>\n\n<p>...but yeah, much of what the officers do is important and cannot be automated, their work is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>What about the other 3 FDC staffmembers per FDC? I wonder what their job is.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/Ch2.htm\">(3) Fire direction computer operator. The fire direction computer operator operates the primary means of computing firing data. He determines and announces fire commands. He also records mission-related data and other information as directed. The equivalent USMC billet description is operations assistant. There is an operations assistant in both the FDC and the BOC.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/Ch2.htm\">(4) Fire direction specialist. There are two fire direction specialists per FDC to facilitate 24-hour operations. In a manual FDC, they serve alternately as horizontal control operator (HCO) and vertical control operator (VCO). The equivalent USMC billet description is fire control man.</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-40/Ch2.htm\">There are five fire control men in a USMC FDC and three more in a BOC to facilitate 24-hour operations. These fire control men may perform the duties of the HCO, VCO, radio operator, or driver as needed in either the FDC or BOC. \n(a) The HCO constructs and maintains the primary firing chart and determines and announces chart data. \n(b) The VCO constructs the secondary firing chart checks chart data, plots initial target location on the situation map, and determines and announces site.\n(c) The radiotelephone operator (RATELO) or driver is normally the operator of the FDC vehicle. He maintains the vehicle and the FDC-associated generators. In a manual FDC, he may also act as the recorder.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, the main purpose of an FDC is still to be &quot;the primary fire control facility for the cannon battery.&quot; These tasks could be very easily automated. The only fire-control staff task that cannot be done by a sufficiently powerful onboard computer is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>During some types of degraded howitzer operations, the battery or platoon FDC may assume direct control of technical fire direction and send firing data to the howitzer. For example, if the digital control system of an individual howitzer section is degraded or inoperative, the FDC may compute technical firing data for that section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, that is an extremely unlikely circumstance. If the fire control system - which is located deep within the howitzer - is degraded, then it is most likely the case that the entire howitzer is inoperable. Even if by some miracle the howitzer would survive such a disabling hit, using a nearby howitzer&#39;s FCS is still preferable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: The preferred method requires an operational howitzer to locate next to the degraded howitzer and the degraded howitzer uses the operational howitzer\u2019s firing data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-ATP 3-09.50</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Tank wise, in 2023 there's going to be no big influx of numbers in general, or Western tanks overall. \n\nInstead what will happen is that in the first half of the year there will be a steady stream of the remainder of T-72 based tanks. The US/Czech partnership started their delivery of 90 modernized T-72s at the end of December. Poland provided roughly 30 modernized T-72s and 30 PT-91s. I don't think they have a significant number of T-72s left, but they should have something like 150+ PT-91s. That means there are roughly 300 committed and potential modernized Soviet tanks left. Which is good because it's about buying time.\n\nThere are 14 Leopard 2A6s, and 40+ 2A4s that Ukrainians need to be trained on but also need repairs. Both of which should be complete in significant numbers by mid-year. More may become available by refurbishment throughout the second half of the year. Additionally, 20-25 Leopard 1s are expected to be ready to go this year, with around 100+ in 2024. There are also the 14 British Challenger 2s. The new Abrams are not expected to be delivered until the end of the year at the earliest  So the potential number of Western tanks that will be given to Ukraine in 2023 is likely to be around 100 at most.  \n\nAbrams are not going to be available this year. Even past this year, they're not going to be available in large amounts. A previous Redditor made a [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/zlvwxy/m1a1_abrams_refurbishing_timeline/) about the timeline for refurbishing M1A1s, which comes out to be about 150 in 12 months. Currently Poland has 116 on order to be delivered this year and next year. \n\nNew M1s also don't have large capacity. The Lima Tank Plant was said to be turning out [15 tanks a month in April 2022](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2022/05/18/army-acquisition-chief-would-welcome-tank-ramp-up-if-congress-funds-it/) - for a total of 180 tanks per year. The Army planned (at that time) to build 22 in 2023, 30 in 2024, and 53 in 2025. At the same time, Poland ordered 250 Abrams which will be delivered in 2025-2026 - an average of 125 per year two years from now. Considering the comments about pushing the Army's and other allies' orders to get Poland's tanks faster, it doesn't seem that there is a significant excess capacity. \n\nInstead of tanks, the biggest equipment delivery impact in Ukraine in 2023 is going to be IFVs. The US has already sent 109 Bradleys and 90 Strykers, and Sweden sent 50 CV90s. Both the Bradley and Stryker are available in large numbers, and the US is looking to move on from both meaning there isn't the same reluctance to give them away like the Abrams. If the US can keep up a 50 Bradley and 90 Strykers a month pace over 2023, the weight of a large number of modern IFVs will mitigate the lack of large tank deliveries.\n\nHowever, all these deliveries serve a different purpose in 2023. As you noted, the war won't end in 2023, with a possibility of it ending in 2024. At the risk of making a fool of myself, I'll predict the first half of 2023 will be the Ukrainians trying to keep Russian gains to a minimum with the second half being Ukrainians making their own small gains. \n\nThe bigger impact than equipment in 2023 will be the gradual  change of training and supply lines from Soviet equipment to NATO equipment. As old equipment degrades, gets scavenged, and gets destroyed to be replaced by new equipment, the logistic lines will become somewhat simpler. Additionally, NATO countries that have started expanding their ammunition and arms outputs will help with making sure a steady stream can be provided. \n\nIn 2024, the idea should be to have broad based training on NATO equipment with steady supplies of parts and ammunition to Ukraine. There is already a commitment of 100+ Leopard 1s for 2024; there may be more Leopard 2s that are in worse shape pulled out of storage and refurbished through 2023 that will be donated. If the rumored 500 Leopard order from Germany becomes a reality, there'd likely be more donations. In 2024, depending on how late the 2023 budget goes in the US, there could still be a significant number of IFVs donated as well as the already purchased 31 Abrams. At that point Ukraine should have the armored basis for starting significant counter offensives.",

The thing is these types of programs don't always work out, or aren't always desireable.\n\nCouple reasons: 1) nations have incentives to maintain domestic capability to manufacture AFVs both for short term economic reasons (export sales, jobs) and long term strategic reasons (you never know who your allies may be in the future and once you lose that industrial knowledge and capacity it's hard to rebuild). Can be mitigated by splitting the manufacturing to some extent.\n\n2) Different requirements and priorities. Even nations that are determined to jointly develop AFVs may not be able to agree on which features and capabilities should be present. If compromise cannot be reached a nation may withdraw from the coalition. You see this with really any jointly developed military hardware, especially in Europe\n\n3) Desire to maintain qualitative edge and technological secrecy. Some nations prefer not to share certain technologies, even with Allies. US will sell you an Abrams, but not with DU armor. USSR export models of tanks had inferior composite armor if I'm not mistaken. And there was plenty of foreign interest in the F-22, which arguably could have funded a longer production run for the US, but we decided sharing the tech wasn't worth it.\n\nAll of this is not to say that joint AFV programs are not in the works - they are. The Main Ground Combat System is an example (joint MBT between Germany, France, and Italy). But such programs are not without issues.\n\nI also think that if US allies were convinced they could actually develop and build a domestic fighter equivalent to the F-35, then some of them would, increased unit cost be damned, just to bolster their defence industries and keep the know how alive. But for many of them the F-35 is their only shot at a 5th gen fighter because the development costs are so damn high and the tech is so sophisticated.",

And there was plenty of foreign interest in the F-22, which arguably could have funded a longer production run for the US, but we decided sharing the tech wasn&#39;t worth it.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is not to say that joint AFV programs are not in the works - they are. The Main Ground Combat System is an example (joint MBT between Germany, France, and Italy). But such programs are not without issues.</p>\n\n<p>I also think that if US allies were convinced they could actually develop and build a domestic fighter equivalent to the F-35, then some of them would, increased unit cost be damned, just to bolster their defence industries and keep the know how alive. But for many of them the F-35 is their only shot at a 5th gen fighter because the development costs are so damn high and the tech is so sophisticated.</p>\n</div>",

The military analyst is head of the research and development department of the Theresian Military Academy.  \n>  \n>tagesschau.de: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called it a logistics race: He said it was now a matter of supplying Ukraine with ammunition and fuel before Moscow seized the initiative on the battlefield. Is he right?  \n>  \n>Markus Reisner: I agree with that 100 per cent. This war will be decided by resources. For a long time, people didn't want to admit that. People believed they could win it in a few months. And now we see that many of the assumptions made by the West have not come true, or hardly come true at all. For example, we have the tenth sanctions package against the Russians, and yet their economy has not collapsed. We have also supplied weapons in incredible quantities. Nevertheless, the Russian army is now going on the offensive.  \n>  \n>tagesschau.de: Germany's Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has announced new orders for ammunition. Does that still help from your point of view?  \n>  \n>Reisner: Yes, of course. This is a very important decision because the defence industry has been pointing out for months that it needs firm commitments and orders to be able to start production again. Some types of ammunition used to have delivery times of twelve months, but now it is 28 months. And that is why the announcement by the German Defence Minister is a clear signal to the defence industry to act and expand its capacities. Of course, the industry must be given assurances of acceptance, i.e. financial guarantees. Production can then proceed relatively quickly, of course in manageable quantities at first. But one can assume that this will definitely make itself felt on the Ukrainian side in the coming weeks and months.  \n>  \n>tagesschau.de: What is the current situation regarding the ammunition stocks of Ukraine's partner countries?  \n>  \n>Reisner: War production still seems unthinkable in Europe. But the problem is that all the stockpiles have been emptied. Recently it was said that the British army could only sustain a war in the form it is being waged in Ukraine for five days. Some forces have little more than 10,000 to 15,000 artillery shells in stock. That is what was fired by the Ukrainian side on peak days in the summer of 2022. At that time, the Russian side fired up to 80,000 shells per day. Europe is no longer prepared for that. After the end of the Cold War, everything was reorganised. The stocks were designed for counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan or Iraq, for example. There are few countries that still maintain truly potent arms production. The production of their own battle tanks was reserved for only a few countries: Germany succeeded in creating an export hit with the \"Leopard\", which is why it is so central to the discussion. The British have their Challenger, the French the Leclerc, the Italians the Ariete, and the same applies to ammunition production, which many countries have outsourced to other countries. This is also the reason why so much pressure is now being put on Switzerland to release special types of ammunition for delivery. Because Switzerland has some of the very things that are so urgently needed and that many other states can no longer produce themselves.  \n>  \n>tagesschau.de: How do Ukraine's ammunition stocks compare to those of Russia?  \n>  \n>Reisner: The Ukrainians conducted a very successful war of manoeuvre in the first few months. Ukraine then went on the offensive again - but now the Russians have turned the situation back into a war of attrition. And this is decided primarily by resources, i.e. ammunition. In the military, there is a term called ammunition hunger. And this hunger for ammunition is now occurring on a massive scale in Ukraine. The Russians' main weapon in warfare of attrition is artillery. According to estimates, the Russians had about 17 million artillery shells before the war began. So far, they have used an incredible seven million of them. Their own production is estimated at about 3.4 million shells per year. That means they still have about 13 to 14 million shells available for this year, which is enough to continue on this path. The Ukrainians' ammunition stocks were much lower at the beginning of the war. It is often overlooked that there have been repeated attacks by the Russians on Ukrainian ammunition depots in the past. The West's own ammunition supplies were quickly used up, so it tried to supply them, and was able to do so relatively quickly. But the Western stocks are now also emptying, so that production must now be increased. Where this can be clearly seen is in the decisions of the USA. So far, the USA has had a manageable annual production rate. But the production of 155-millimetre ammunition, for example, is now to be increased from 15,000 to 90,000 units per month so that massive deliveries can be made.  \n>  \n>tagesschau.de: Is Russia getting behind with the production of weapons and ammunition?  \n>  \n>Reisner: Russia has been preparing for years. Let me give you an example. After the first weeks of the war, the Russians had deployed about 530 cruise missiles, as many as the Americans had deployed in Iraq at the beginning of 2003. In the meantime, the Russians have fired more than 5,200 in repeated waves of attacks. The Russian stockpiles are emptying, but since they have made a deal with the Iranians, for example, and have built up a follow-up supply, they can always fly new attacks on the strategic and critical infrastructure. We have now had the 13th wave of attacks a few days ago, and Ukraine is finding it very difficult to defend itself with the available air defences. The Russian attacks are also much cheaper than the Ukrainian defences. A German Iris-T anti-aircraft missile cost 400,000 euros in the summer, now it costs about 750,000 euros. An Iranian drone costs 20,000 US dollars. That's why it's so important to make the decision now to increase production and deliveries, even if they are expensive, because otherwise Ukraine will simply run out of time. Because that is exactly what Russia is counting on.\n\n[cont](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/112xfw2/comment/j8nmwip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).",

Nevertheless, the Russian army is now going on the offensive.  </p>\n\n<p>tagesschau.de: Germany&#39;s Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has announced new orders for ammunition. Does that still help from your point of view?  </p>\n\n<p>Reisner: Yes, of course. This is a very important decision because the defence industry has been pointing out for months that it needs firm commitments and orders to be able to start production again. Some types of ammunition used to have delivery times of twelve months, but now it is 28 months. And that is why the announcement by the German Defence Minister is a clear signal to the defence industry to act and expand its capacities. Of course, the industry must be given assurances of acceptance, i.e. financial guarantees. Production can then proceed relatively quickly, of course in manageable quantities at first. But one can assume that this will definitely make itself felt on the Ukrainian side in the coming weeks and months.  </p>\n\n<p>tagesschau.de: What is the current situation regarding the ammunition stocks of Ukraine&#39;s partner countries?  </p>\n\n<p>Reisner: War production still seems unthinkable in Europe. But the problem is that all the stockpiles have been emptied. Recently it was said that the British army could only sustain a war in the form it is being waged in Ukraine for five days. Some forces have little more than 10,000 to 15,000 artillery shells in stock. That is what was fired by the Ukrainian side on peak days in the summer of 2022. At that time, the Russian side fired up to 80,000 shells per day. Europe is no longer prepared for that. After the end of the Cold War, everything was reorganised. The stocks were designed for counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan or Iraq, for example. There are few countries that still maintain truly potent arms production. The production of their own battle tanks was reserved for only a few countries: Germany succeeded in creating an export hit with the &quot;Leopard&quot;, which is why it is so central to the discussion. The British have their Challenger, the French the Leclerc, the Italians the Ariete, and the same applies to ammunition production, which many countries have outsourced to other countries. This is also the reason why so much pressure is now being put on Switzerland to release special types of ammunition for delivery. Because Switzerland has some of the very things that are so urgently needed and that many other states can no longer produce themselves.  </p>\n\n<p>tagesschau.de: How do Ukraine&#39;s ammunition stocks compare to those of Russia?  </p>\n\n<p>Reisner: The Ukrainians conducted a very successful war of manoeuvre in the first few months. Ukraine then went on the offensive again - but now the Russians have turned the situation back into a war of attrition. And this is decided primarily by resources, i.e. ammunition. In the military, there is a term called ammunition hunger. And this hunger for ammunition is now occurring on a massive scale in Ukraine. The Russians&#39; main weapon in warfare of attrition is artillery. According to estimates, the Russians had about 17 million artillery shells before the war began. So far, they have used an incredible seven million of them. Their own production is estimated at about 3.4 million shells per year. That means they still have about 13 to 14 million shells available for this year, which is enough to continue on this path. The Ukrainians&#39; ammunition stocks were much lower at the beginning of the war. It is often overlooked that there have been repeated attacks by the Russians on Ukrainian ammunition depots in the past. The West&#39;s own ammunition supplies were quickly used up, so it tried to supply them, and was able to do so relatively quickly. But the Western stocks are now also emptying, so that production must now be increased. Where this can be clearly seen is in the decisions of the USA. So far, the USA has had a manageable annual production rate. But the production of 155-millimetre ammunition, for example, is now to be increased from 15,000 to 90,000 units per month so that massive deliveries can be made.  </p>\n\n<p>tagesschau.de: Is Russia getting behind with the production of weapons and ammunition?  </p>\n\n<p>Reisner: Russia has been preparing for years. Let me give you an example. After the first weeks of the war, the Russians had deployed about 530 cruise missiles, as many as the Americans had deployed in Iraq at the beginning of 2003. In the meantime, the Russians have fired more than 5,200 in repeated waves of attacks. The Russian stockpiles are emptying, but since they have made a deal with the Iranians, for example, and have built up a follow-up supply, they can always fly new attacks on the strategic and critical infrastructure. We have now had the 13th wave of attacks a few days ago, and Ukraine is finding it very difficult to defend itself with the available air defences. The Russian attacks are also much cheaper than the Ukrainian defences. A German Iris-T anti-aircraft missile cost 400,000 euros in the summer, now it costs about 750,000 euros. An Iranian drone costs 20,000 US dollars. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to make the decision now to increase production and deliveries, even if they are expensive, because otherwise Ukraine will simply run out of time. Because that is exactly what Russia is counting on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/112xfw2/comment/j8nmwip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">cont</a>.</p>\n</div>",

However, the weapons supplied by the West are only enough to enable the Ukrainians to defend themselves, but not to enable the Ukrainians themselves to go on the offensive on a massive scale. This means that the Americans always try to support Ukraine when a symmetrical situation becomes asymmetrical, i.e. when Russia gains the upper hand, so that it becomes a symmetrical situation again. But they try not to react beyond that, because they fear that Russia will then feel cornered and react irrationally. In other words, they are trying to wear down the Russians on the timeline as well. To put it metaphorically: The Russians are strangling the Ukrainians and hope that they will run out of steam. And the Americans are strangling the Russians and hoping that they will run out of air before the Ukrainians do. The tragedy is that the war cannot be ended quickly in this way. There are only two options for the West if it wants to end the war quickly. The first option is massive support for Ukraine. If, however, the West considers this massive support for Ukraine too risky or is unable to do so due to a lack of resources or disagreement, it must try to give Russia a face-saving exit from the current course of the war. However, this would be tantamount to a defeat for Ukraine - and for the West.",

Like you're fine working on a cargo plane that delivers weapons but not on the weapon, cool. Or you're fine working on a communications system that can be used to coordinate violent attacks, but you're not cool with that system being used directly on a weapon. What's the difference really? Between, for example, when someone calls in coordinates for a strike over a Starlink-enabled channel, and when they use a Stalink to connect to and guide a kamikaze drone toward a target. \n\nBasically, if someone doesn't like the US Department of Defense that much, they should not be working in a field where 90% of the demand comes from the government. Nor should they try to take moral responsibility for how dual use products are employed by the government. If I grow grain and the government buys that grain to feed soldiers, I am not morally responsible for that. If I grow grain and refuse to sell to the government, I am still driving down the overall price of grain so my work is still benefiting defense. I am also not morally responsible for that. \n\nEngineering is not the place to make ethical decisions about how a system can be used by the government (beyond the minimal floor of \"I won't enable war crimes\" such as by literally designing gas chambers or something like that). That's why we have a representative democracy, so that democratically elected officials can make these ethical decisions in a manner that reflects the popular will. Private industry should not be dictating government policy because of the whims of a subset of their employees. If you don't like what the Department of Defense is doing, your remedy is the political process, not unilateral action to undermine the security posture of the country. And I can virtually guarantee you that nearly all of the engineers pulling this shit are in no way involved in politics and make no effort to change the DoD policies with which they disagree through the legitimate mechanisms of our government.

They don&#39;t get to quibble about which defense purposes are OK and which aren&#39;t, that&#39;s why we have a democracy. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We also already have a legal system for dealing with the ethical considerations of engineers and scientists, and it allows them to refuse to work on projects they might find immoral (with few exceptions).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They may have that right, but their remedy is to quit, not to force the company to undermine US defense policy. But quitting doesn&#39;t change the policy, because there are plenty of engineers willing to do this work, so instead you get situations like this, where individuals are exercising political power outside of the political system. No one elected the SpaceX engineers, so they shouldn&#39;t get to decide political issues unilaterally.</p>\n\n<p>None of this changes how ridiculous it is to claim that they suddenly have an objection to the military using their work when the military has already been using their work for years. You don&#39;t get to take a paycheck from the DoD and then years later cry foul because the military gives you the heebie jeebies.</p>\n</div>",

To do so is to say that someone else is entitled to their labor, which is fundamentally intractable to the West&#39;s values. </p>\n\n<p>And I aay this from the perspective of someone who thinks the alleged concerns by such engineers to be dumb, but I can&#39;t say that they should be <em>forced</em> to do any work as they are private employees.</p>\n</div>",
