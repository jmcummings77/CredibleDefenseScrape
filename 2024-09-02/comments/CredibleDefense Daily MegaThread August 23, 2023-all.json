As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

That being said, here is the [first one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15rqotr/comment/jwedkcg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and here is a briefer, [second one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15w9kbk/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_20_2023/jx4941s/?context=3). Keep in mind, I was writing them as things unfolded, but I think they about sum up what I'd expect in the near future - one other potential avenue that I believe I didn't mention is towards Novopokrovka (just North of the highway towards Polohy). There's been some movements in that direction lately. I have a couple of days ago, while writing it, made an attempt at a [very rough map](https://imgur.com/a/3GVORU1) (again, want to underline the rough part) trying to show the three key heights going forward with an overlay of the Russian pre-prepared positions from the DeepState along with a topographic map. I might get back to writing it up once I get the time, but a few things to note - advance towards Kopani is possible via another route through the trenches in the lower grounds given that trenches weren't dug into the high grounds (yellow) that are accessible just south of Robotyne, the other thing to note Verbove is reachable via heights (red) north of the Robotyne-Verbove road and via the ones South of it, where the key ridgeline (green) is located. I wouldn't expect UAF pursuing an advance towards Verbove through the low grounds without one of those two latter heights being secured.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'd just like to add one more thing - I don't expect them pushing west or east further than an absolute minimum required to secure their flanks, short of a major break in the Russian lines which I don't think is likely as it stands. For a number of reasons that I'll get into one time - I suspect if there is a concentrated push towards Verbove and/or Kopani and/or Novopokrovka I wouldn't expect it to amount anything too substantial, we haven't seen AFU performing mutually supportive pushes from different axes and neither one of those three areas, unlike what a cursory look of the map might suggest, offers an easy way into more operational space under conditions that I believe AFU would find palatable.",

Similarly, a lot of general infrastructure information is available on OSM, e.g. railroads, roads, bridges, etc.\n\nStatus of forces information is generally the highest priority for a military to keep secret/classified. So you will likely not find tons of good information about specific units and their deployments unless the open source community is paying close attention to the specific military in question such as has been the case for Russia over the past few years.\n\n> Is there a website that has lists of all the publicly known active duty general officers in major countries like China and Russia?\n\nNot that I know of, and frankly I would be a little surprised, given how much confusion there still frequently is in the press and open source community about the activities and assignments of even well-known Russian generals, never mind the more obscure figures.

        "body": "I just got around to listening to this interview with U.S. ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel.  Full podcast and transcript at the link but I've quoted the part relevant to geopolitics and defense.  \n\nThe part about our work to be able to repair our ships in Japan and the training and logistical considerations that have to come with it was most interesting to me.  I'll echo what other posters have said recently, it's nice to have an administration that's competent in the international arena.  \n\nhttps://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-suddenly-diplomatic-rahm-emanuel/\n\nDUBNER: Let me just ask you, on the Japan-South Korea thaw, if we want to call it that, or \u2014 \n\nEMANUEL: Rapprochement.\n\nDUBNER: Or the rapprochement, that\u2019s better.\n\nEMANUEL: Yeah, for the undiplomat Rahm Emanuel, there it is.\n\nDUBNER: Or the military upgrade, which we\u2019ve been reading a lot about here. You\u2019re implying that you\u2019ve been rather involved. That would be a natural assumption. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not taking credit for having done any of this alone. It\u2019s a big apparatus. But give me an example of how, let\u2019s say, you and your U.S. counterparts, both in Japan and in D.C., were involved in one of these avenues, I think the military commitment might be a more interesting one. \n\nEMANUEL: I want to be clear. These are independent countries. They\u2019re making independent decisions. But you, as a representative for the United States, play a role, and to Prime Minister Kishida \u2014 first, I want to give him a shout-out, because before even a tank was on the Ukrainian border and some in Europe were claiming would never happen, he, the Prime Minister here, thousands of miles away, said we have to increase our defense budget.\n\nDUBNER: He\u2019s thinking if Russia can do that to Ukraine, China can do that to us, essentially?\n\nEMANUEL: There\u2019s that. China\u2019s become much more aggressive. They fired five missiles into Japan\u2019s E.E.Z., which is their security zone and economic zone. That kind of wakes you up in the morning. And you got North Korea firing off 72 missiles. You\u2019ve got to think different strategically. I believe there are three C\u2019s in the last three years that have changed the world \u2014 COVID, the conflict in Europe, and the coercion by China. And all three of those have upended every assumption we\u2019ve had for the last 30 years. And we\u2019re now making adjustments, Japan no different. Not only did they decide to double their defense budget to the NATO standard of two percent of G.D.P., but also then to acquire skills and capabilities that give their deterrence a capital D. And our role, as ambassador, we had all these things that we were trying to get done and help shape, influence, discuss, what we thought was important. And so we ran an internal process and then back and forth with Washington, and we came up with six or seven things that we said, these are like, list A, not all things are equal. If you want to really spend these resources, you want to build up this level of deterrence, we think this is the things that you must get done.\n\nDUBNER: So my sense is that Japan has been changing not only a lot, but quickly, and along many dimensions \u2014 politically, economically, socially \u2014 and, especially, that there\u2019s a sense of urgency among the political leadership. I may be wrong on that, but I\u2019d like you to tell me a little bit about Prime Minister Kishida and maybe it\u2019s his metabolism, maybe he\u2019s different than predecessors \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s not him. But I am curious to know, if this urgency is real, what\u2019s producing it? Is it China threat \u2014 is it that simple, or is it much deeper than that?\n\nEMANUEL: Can I, uh, again \u2014 it would be oh-so-unlike an Emanuel not to interrupt you.\n\nDUBNER: Yeah, you can correct everything I just said. I\u2019m accustomed to that. \n\nEMANUEL: I know, but I\u2019m now going to not just say, \u201ccan I correct?\u201d I\u2019m just going to do it. Here\u2019s what I would \u2014 we\u2019re doing that. That\u2019s what the CHIPS bill is. We\u2019re changing. And I always say this, I say, \u201cWe\u2019re not asking you to change on your own. We have to change.\u201d Japan, on the military side, is about to create an integrated structure. We have to think about this structure ourselves. We have something that\u2019s an outgrowth of 70 years ago. I always say this to our team \u2014 the Defense Department, the State Department, at the National Security \u2014 if we had a legal page and it was blank, would we actually draft what we have? And the answer is no. So let\u2019s think about this. I\u2019m working with senators right now on this idea, because our General Accounting Office in the United States said, \u201cWe\u2019re 4,000 days behind on ship repairs.\u201d Well, there\u2019s a ban using foreign shipyards. If we, God forbid, ever had a conflict, you\u2019re not taking that ship back to San Diego. So we better start thinking about, like, if you want to train together, you better deter together. \n\nDUBNER: Finish that loop: you\u2019re trying to make it so that the U.S. ships can be repaired there, correct?\n\nEMANUEL: Surface ships, and that we do it now while we\u2019re at peace time so we can get the parts here, the blueprints here, the training here. If you\u2019re going to do integrated air defense, we\u2019re going to train. So we know if the situation ever occurs, we\u2019re not first working together in a hot situation. Well, that should be true also for the repair and maintenance. You can\u2019t wait six months for a ship to go out of the theater to come back. The time to practice that is not in a hot moment. Now, my thing is we have to update \u2014 and I always say this when I interact with Japanese: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking you to change things and us stay the same. We, too, are evaluating. We have good days and bad days on that.\u201d That\u2019s politics. That\u2019s the process. That\u2019s an evolution. And one of the most fascinating things to me, politically \u2014 now, this is kind of stepping out, and I want to be careful, so I don\u2019t create \u2014\n\nDUBNER: Nah, don\u2019t be careful.\n\nEMANUEL: I look at American politics. And I have three kids, all out of college now. One\u2019s in the Navy. The other one works in the media. The other one\u2019s a dancer. Their generation, I meet their friends, very much appropriately care about climate change; inequality, whether it\u2019s on the racial side, sexual orientation, income side. Older voters in America, I\u2019m speaking generically \u2014 a little more conservative, hawkish, clearly on national security. Here in Japan, older voters are more dovish on national security and it\u2019s the younger voters that are more hawkish. So it\u2019s a very \u2014 I\u2019m like looking at data, polling, etcetera, and I\u2019m like \u201chmm.\u201d \n\nDUBNER: Why is that? Is it a deeper, different understanding of China? \n\nEMANUEL: There\u2019s China, there\u2019s Russia, there\u2019s North Korea. The neighborhood is not just calm waters. As President Xi said, there\u2019s choppy waters. Well, they\u2019re chopping them. China has fundamentally altered Japan, the region, and made people think different, act different. Because the region as a whole \u2014 you can see it from India to Japan, South Korea, you can see Australia, Philippines, others \u2014 realize that an untethered China, an unmatched China, is a China that doesn\u2019t follow the good-neighbor policy.",

And one of the most fascinating things to me, politically \u2014 now, this is kind of stepping out, and I want to be careful, so I don\u2019t create \u2014</p>\n\n<p>DUBNER: Nah, don\u2019t be careful.</p>\n\n<p>EMANUEL: I look at American politics. And I have three kids, all out of college now. One\u2019s in the Navy. The other one works in the media. The other one\u2019s a dancer. Their generation, I meet their friends, very much appropriately care about climate change; inequality, whether it\u2019s on the racial side, sexual orientation, income side. Older voters in America, I\u2019m speaking generically \u2014 a little more conservative, hawkish, clearly on national security. Here in Japan, older voters are more dovish on national security and it\u2019s the younger voters that are more hawkish. So it\u2019s a very \u2014 I\u2019m like looking at data, polling, etcetera, and I\u2019m like \u201chmm.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>DUBNER: Why is that? Is it a deeper, different understanding of China? </p>\n\n<p>EMANUEL: There\u2019s China, there\u2019s Russia, there\u2019s North Korea. The neighborhood is not just calm waters. As President Xi said, there\u2019s choppy waters. Well, they\u2019re chopping them. China has fundamentally altered Japan, the region, and made people think different, act different. Because the region as a whole \u2014 you can see it from India to Japan, South Korea, you can see Australia, Philippines, others \u2014 realize that an untethered China, an unmatched China, is a China that doesn\u2019t follow the good-neighbor policy.</p>\n</div>",

And using Japan for repairs is not a smart idea too because in the event of war against China, those shipyards will not be accessible to the US Navy (they will either be destroyed or the USN ships will stay away to avoid getting hit). The US should really focus on improving its shipbuilding and overall manufacturing capacity. As the Russo-Ukraine war demonstrates peer-conflict, sustaining a war requires production of huge quantities of weapons and ammunition. \n\nIt's also important to note that while the US likes to celebrate \"alliance\" to oppose China, none of these countries have publicly committed to defending Taiwan militarily or supporting the US in the event of war with China. This is important because this is not the first time the US tried and failed to create military alliance in Asia. There is the now defunct SEATO (South East Asia Treaty Organization) which existed from 1954 to 1977 and the failed NEATO (North East Asia Treaty Organization). Unless there's some new NATO style alliance formed with public commitments to defending Taiwan military, for example, I don't think the US can count on these countries in the event of a war with China.",
