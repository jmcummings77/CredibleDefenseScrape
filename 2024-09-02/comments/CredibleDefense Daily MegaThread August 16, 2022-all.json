They\u2018re just kind of different and they\u2019re not used to communicating with non-Parisians. That said im probably the only non-Parisian on earth who likes Parisians lol\n\nBut to the point, yes France has a history of no-nonsense geopolitical actions that sort of lives on until today, in that sense their legacy probably makes them more suited to pursuing the kind of policy you seem to be looking for. But just like all of the large western European countries, France is a relatively declining player and won\u2018t be able to really do much on its own. That imo is the very core of the problem Europe is facing - if a country wants to do something, it can\u2019t do it alone. For a while we went along with just doing whatever the US was doing, but i think since the Iraq war at the latest that\u2019s out of fashion - people aren\u2019t willing to just follow the Americans anymore. Countries and individuals need to feel like they\u2019re participating in the decision-making process leading up to a geopolitical action to be on board with it. So i think what the EU needs is institutionalised decision-making processes to even make geopolitical action - which necessarily has to be collective - possible. \n\nHow we do that is up for debate - i can think of two options: either we keep individual states in place and try to streamline collective decision-making, ie we try to bring the political heads of member states together as often as possible to make common decisions on important topics as often as possible, and we try to foster consensus and solidarity. The second option is to erode member states\u2018 authority and to instead create European, \u201efederal\u201c institutions that have decision-making power. I think option two would be preferable, but option one is much more realistic for now, so we will probably go along with it. As time goes on and Europe acts as more of a bloc we might hopefully see more acceptance for common institutions, but we\u2018ll see. \n\nAnd, well, to get to that point, we need a culture of bargaining and compromise. And i think as much as i expect you\u2018re going to hate that, the German political system seems much, much closer to that ideal than the French one. German politics is all about balancing and bargaining between institutionalised interests and representatives, whether it be organised labour, the business community, political parties, etc. All these interests are integrated into the political system to create a kind of slow but incredibly stable behemoth that is actually capable of crafting surprisingly long-term (if bad) policy. \n\nIn contrast, French politics is much more personalistic and abrupt. Elections happen every five years, whoever wins them controls literally everything during those five years, and as a results they\u2019re expected to fix every problem imaginable, except of course they can\u2019t so after five years they\u2019re replaced with someone completely different. Macron is obfuscating that dynamic through sheer competence, he has passed a slew of reforms that might have sounded unpopular as hell at first but have turned out to be quite effective. His government also handled the economy and covid quite well in the circumstances. You can probably tell i love him quite a bit at this point, so here\u2019s an unbiased argument as to why he\u2018s an outlier in French politics: he got elected at a time where the established parties collapsed, and they haven\u2019t been fully replaced yet. The far left and far right don\u2018t have the organisational structures in place that are necessary to challenge Macron effectively - the far-right party especially is highly concentrated within an inner circle around  Le Pen and doesn\u2018t have much of a grassroots organisation at all (tbh unless leadership changes they likely never will). The far-left has only recently risen in popularity and hasn\u2019t had the time yet to convert that into an established political machine - in fact im not entirely sure they ever will be able to build one either. But to the point, this means that the political leadership in France at the moment is much more settled than it has been in the past or will be in the future. So France is highly unstable politically and not at all a reliable long-term leader - as before though I\u2019d argue we don\u2019t need a European leader, we need a European culture of effective bargaining to establish a consensus between member states. And well guess what, France doesn\u2019t have a negotiation and consensus culture at all either, no one in French politics ever negotiates, because compromise is seen as a betrayal of your values or whatever. \n\nSo uh in short we don\u2019t need an individual country to step up and lead the continent, we need to come together as a whole before doing anything, and France is kinda bad at that",

Not sure how this can be spun as &quot;appeasement&quot; given the massive amounts of aid already given to Ukraine by the US. Was Woodrow Wilson a &quot;german appeaser&quot; from 1914-1916?</p>\n</div>",

That seems close enough to start trickling in some ATACMS to Ukraine without fear that stocks for that capability will go too low. \n\nAlthough, perhaps the reticence to provide ATACMS is a sign that the PrSM program isn't going perfectly smoothly and 2023 is, shall we say, \"optimistic\"?",

A M31 GMLRS likely has a total flight time of three minutes or so and a apogee likely exceeding the peak intercepting altitude of the S-300PMU2. The missile can't be detected on launch because, as always, Earth is round and radar is subject to [radar horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_horizon). The missile is already difficult to detect as it is small with the only flat surfaces being the [tiny forward control surfaces](https://www.army-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/GMLRS_bahrain-FMS_Army-1_edit.jpg). The rear stabilizers are round to contour to the body of the missile when folded in the launch container. This makes the most likely time for a intercept after the missile has begun descending and accelerating to or at terminal velocity as it enters the S-300PMU2 maximum altitude(25km), a intercept window less than a minute long before impact. The maximum intercept range of the S-300PMU2 is *only* 40km, a number that needs to be balanced against range, altitude, speed of the target, and dozens of other variables. \n\nPeople have been talking about Ukraine using diversionary tactics to overwhelm Russian AD, or that the GMRLS is a quasi-ballistic missile that performs maneuvers to avoid AD interception, and a bunch of other things. But ballistic missiles are just very hard to shoot down, more so for shorter range missile as there is less of a window to react. \n\nLike the GMLRS there are no reliable numbers for the ATACMS flight profile. Wiki states the apogee is 50km, linked off a minimal National Interest article. I'd assume from their wording that this reflects the maximum range of the missile. Time from launch to impact is likely in the 5 to 6 minute range. Intercept window for a S-300 is during the terminal phase after the missile has descended below 25km if the battery is directly below the impact point, the missile will have to descend lower depending on distance to battery. At this point the missile is almost guaranteed to be at terminal velocity, which is likely in excess of at least a few times of the speed of sound. ATACMS presents a larger window for reaction due to the longer flight time. If the S-300PMU-2 is capable of reliably of intercepting ATACMS it'll require a battery to be within less than 25km of the target.",

And since theybare hardened structures, if somehow they are cracked, they are gonna spew radiation for a looong time (reasons for the sarcophagus on chernobyl still)\n\nNow a weaponized one, would create a runaway fission which burns itself out with maximum energy (ofc its much more complicated then that, \"we\" have low radiation, high radiation warheads). That means that there is a limited amount of radiation going around, not spewing out from an \"unlimited\" source for a long time.\n\nHowever, a lot of ppl doesnt seem to understand a lot about radiation. What happens is that you apply a lot of xy ray energy to an object (like dirt) and depending on the atteibutes of the object and the rays you have an object that is slowly decaying its matter in a molecular sense, causing additional radiation. Some stuff can be irradiated with specific rays and not cause it to be radioactive. (Actually we do this with some of our food, to kill bacteria and I think even viruses?) Air for example is very hard tk make even a little radiactive, BUT the small shit in the air is not.
