In late March when they were badly overstretched everywhere and decided to pull out of northern Ukraine and decrease the scope of the operation, all the milbloggers were quite worried, but coincidentally within a few days they finally managed to capture Izyum which everyone knew was going to be a major strategic hub for all the operations in Donbas, and siege of Mariupol was nearing its completion with last of Ukraine's defenders being left only in Azovstal. They also started transporting a lot more equipment from the east. So the narrative shifted from blitzkrieging weak Ukraine to \"This is going to take time but we'll fight steady and win eventually\", as our friends kept reminding us, they were \"still making progress\". \n\nWhen the Kharkiv offensive happened, milbloggers went all doom and gloom, a lot of finger-pointing, and a blame game. But then Putin announced the mobilization and annexation of parts of Ukraine, and they also started bombing cities and civilian infrastructure. So the narrative shifted yet again Russia was finally taking gloves off, no Mr nice guy, we'll sacrifice a million Russians if we have to but we'll win eventually.\n\nThis time Russia went a little ahead of the humiliation (though I don't expect the orderly retreat to be quite orderly), so the reaction wasn't quite as big, but you know the moment we see Ukrainian flags flying above Kherson the same cycle will repeat again. So how are they going to shift the narrative this time? More bombing of Kyiv? Shoving every bit of equipment in the direction of Bakhmut to finally conquer the city? This defeat is quite close to the last one and they are still riding high of conscripting 55yo pediatricians, but I still think Kremlin will feel like they'll need to do something big so everyone forgets about Kherson.",

Its one thing to risk fighting a defensive battle with a horrible supply line to outright stop or delay with heavy cost a UAF offensive, but its quite another to risk that when Putin's political clout is waning due to repeated defeats, failure to gain legit victories, forced to implement unpopular decisions (mobilization), and perceived weakness (Kerch Bridge attack).

Total is about ~550, and of that 21 destroyed with pics, so let's say they got about 500 that is still operational. Then subtract whatever you estimate as likely noncombat losses. Plus of course however many Ukraine had to start with, but that suffered both combat attrition, and issues with supply of Soviet caliber ammunition.\n\nAccording to IISS Military Balance 2022, Russia had about 5900 artillery pieces in active service. There are no good estimates of storage, but it could be a couple thousand more - we definitely saw some ancient guns dragged out from who know where. Ukraine claims they destroyed ~2300 of them so far, that figure of course has big error bars. There's also likely serious noncombat losses, might be worse than on Ukrainian side as a lot of these systems are ancient and poorly maintained.\n\nTo add it up, while their advantage decreased significantly since summer, Russia still has major numbers advantage in artillery, by back-of-the-envelop calculations something of order of magnitude of 4:1. The main limiting factor is supply of shells thanks to HIMARS disrupting easy supply situation Russia used to have. To help Ukraine the most important thing to do right now is give Ukraine ATACMS or other long range weapons, to enable it to target logistics centers beyond its current range.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html\">Oryx has a list of estimated numbers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/10/how-is-russia-faring-against-nato.html\">also how much of that was lost so far</a> (I&#39;d generally double estimated losses, Oryx getting 50% of them as pics seems like a reasonable guess). Total is about ~550, and of that 21 destroyed with pics, so let&#39;s say they got about 500 that is still operational. Then subtract whatever you estimate as likely noncombat losses. Plus of course however many Ukraine had to start with, but that suffered both combat attrition, and issues with supply of Soviet caliber ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>According to IISS Military Balance 2022, Russia had about 5900 artillery pieces in active service. There are no good estimates of storage, but it could be a couple thousand more - we definitely saw some ancient guns dragged out from who know where. Ukraine claims they destroyed ~2300 of them so far, that figure of course has big error bars. There&#39;s also likely serious noncombat losses, might be worse than on Ukrainian side as a lot of these systems are ancient and poorly maintained.</p>\n\n<p>To add it up, while their advantage decreased significantly since summer, Russia still has major numbers advantage in artillery, by back-of-the-envelop calculations something of order of magnitude of 4:1.

But his overall message is &quot;we&#39;re not giving them the longer range missiles they really want&quot; and he made 2 mistakes about distance in the same sentence so I wouldn&#39;t much confidence that he was on the nose about another distance.</p>\n</div>",

There are probably many complex factors that feed into why Ukraine has been far smarter in this war, but that is honestly the case. They have a more democratic open society defined by their revolution against being a closed puppet state, they benefit from the support of a more open and democratic West, and their very underdog material resources absolutely necessitated from the start that they use what they have effectively or not even try.

The one where ~300 elite marine infantry are supposed to have been killed. One of the major mistakes with that offensive was that they took the town without taking or supressing the artillery in Vuhledar first. [Look at a map.](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Pavlivka,+Oblast+Donetsk,+Oekra%C3%AFne,+85672/@47.7647873,37.2238254,14.16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x40e0ac8c85487fe3:0x15464086d54b9bed!8m2!3d47.7552644!4d37.2194394?hl=nl). Pavlivka is below Vuhledar (height-wise), and many of its major streets point directly at Vuhledar.

Like let's look at Kofman's estimate of 11k plus or minus 4k that he made 4-5 months ago.  There are probably similar error bars on even US govt estimates (since Ukraine doesn't share much info with America, there are multiple times in the war where OSINT seems to know about as much as the pentagon, at least publically).   \n\nSo just as an exercise, assume a current KIA of 30k - considering the assumptions compound as the war progresses, the error bars on that are probably at least 8k either side.  \n\nThen we consider the fact we don't know the KIA to wounded ratio in this war, it could be anywhere from 2 to 4, realistically.\n\nWe'd end up with a realistic casualties range of 66k-190k.  That is a comically large range.  Of course, these are example statistics to show how these ranges are going to keep getting larger.  If you assume a higher KIA number (like the Ukrainians suggest) these ranges would be even larger.\n\nSo numerical discussion of overall casualties is approaching pointless.",
