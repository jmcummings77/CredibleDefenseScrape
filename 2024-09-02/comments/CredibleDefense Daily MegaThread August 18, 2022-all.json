How big is that strategic reserve? I don't know exactly but 100 days of high intensity conflict is about 5.5 million shells (by the War in Ukraine standards) so they've only got 1.5 million until they hit that level, at their current reduced intensity they'll hit that in 50 days.\n\nThe tweet suggests that those stockpiles of soviet era shells can only be made available at a rate of 0.5m a year so they're largely irrelevant, the total resupply rate is only around 5 thousand shells a day.\n\nThis is all back of a fag packet maths and we don't know the underlying details but it seems to me that, come October, Russia is going to have to drastically cut it's artillery expenditure.",

The Kherson area is separated by the Donets and Inhulets from Russian railheads. Every weapon, every shell, every ration, every vehicle, and every drop of fuel must travel across one or both of these rivers. Ukraine has interdicted (in part or in whole) all bridge traffic, which means pontoons, barges, and air traffic - all of which are expensive and vulnerable.\n2. That's the \"close interdiction\". Now, consider the \"far interdiction\" of Ukrainian HIMARS, air, saboteur, and SOF operations in southern Kherson oblast and, increasingly now also in Crimea. Priority targets here seem to be anything that can deliver or block long-range fires in the South-Western portion of the front.\n3. Ukrainian \"shaping\" efforts in this area also continue at the tactical level. Along the entire front line, I propose (subject to correction here and elsewhere) that it is easiest for Ukraine to match or even overmatch Russian mortar and artillery firepower around Kherson, because here ammo travels least far for Ukraine, and furthest for Russia.\n4. Kherson's advantages for Ukraine don't stop there. Consider the front line as a whole (with, say, an ISW map on front of you), and notice how Russian forces form a semi-circle around Ukraine forces enjoying interior lines. Kherson is at one tip of the longer Russian arc, a logistically troubling situation made worse by a) points 1 and 2 above, b) Ukrainian partisan/SOF activity around Melitopol, and c) the continuing failure of the Russian army to devote enough trucks and manpower to off-rail logistics.  \nWhenever Russian forces \"slosh\" away from the Donbass to safeguard the approaches to either Kharkiv or Kherson, they travel long distances, wear out vehicles, and consume time, logistical support, and maintenance materiel. *Russia does not have a superabundance of any of these things.*\n5. Once Ukrainian \"shaping\" of the regional battlefield is sufficiently advanced, a full-blooded attack may - or may not - happen around Kherson. Should the Ukrainians choose Kherson, then Russian expenditure of any war supplies necessary to the defence of that city will - to reiterate - pass over at least one major river, allowing greater opportunities to attrite valuable materiel (and manpower).\n\nNone of this means Kherson is the \"best\" place for Ukraine to attack.

Along the entire front line, I propose (subject to correction here and elsewhere) that it is easiest for Ukraine to match or even overmatch Russian mortar and artillery firepower around Kherson, because here ammo travels least far for Ukraine, and furthest for Russia.</li>\n<li>Kherson&#39;s advantages for Ukraine don&#39;t stop there. Consider the front line as a whole (with, say, an ISW map on front of you), and notice how Russian forces form a semi-circle around Ukraine forces enjoying interior lines. Kherson is at one tip of the longer Russian arc, a logistically troubling situation made worse by a) points 1 and 2 above, b) Ukrainian partisan/SOF activity around Melitopol, and c) the continuing failure of the Russian army to devote enough trucks and manpower to off-rail logistics.<br/>\nWhenever Russian forces &quot;slosh&quot; away from the Donbass to safeguard the approaches to either Kharkiv or Kherson, they travel long distances, wear out vehicles, and consume time, logistical support, and maintenance materiel. <em>Russia does not have a superabundance of any of these things.</em></li>\n<li>Once Ukrainian &quot;shaping&quot; of the regional battlefield is sufficiently advanced, a full-blooded attack may - or may not - happen around Kherson. Should the Ukrainians choose Kherson, then Russian expenditure of any war supplies necessary to the defence of that city will - to reiterate - pass over at least one major river, allowing greater opportunities to attrite valuable materiel (and manpower).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>None of this means Kherson is the &quot;best&quot; place for Ukraine to attack. It may, however, be one of the more advantageous.</p>\n</div>",

But with that in mind, what is your blurry mental overall roadmap to a negotiated settlement right now? Assuming whatever changes to the frontlines you think are likely before both sides are exhausted, say within 6ish more months of fighting.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly inspired by Erdogan and Guterre visiting Zelenskyy to discuss this specific topic.</p>\n</div>",
