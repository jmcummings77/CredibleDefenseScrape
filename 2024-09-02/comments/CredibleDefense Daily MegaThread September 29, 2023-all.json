As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

It only requires the UA govt to acknowledge that donated equipment meant to support Ukraine would be used for training and not fighting. Good luck with that. They won't commit to that for the same reason they wont extend training to keep troops in training centers longer versus fighting, freeing up officers and NCOs as trainers versus fighting, etc. \n\nIt means they have to throttle back on their operational tempo, which means the most senior Ukrainians have to be much more picky about which battles they fight, and to start accepting the occasional defeat with limited resistance if it means preserving their force structure.",

However, the flow would be constant, allowing them to have units to fall in on western equipment, trained from the ground up really on tactics, and you start to get your Junior NCOs you need, and company grade officers.

They have constantly penny-packeted things out, rushing from emergency to emergency (or opportunity to opportunity, pick your poison). Maintenance of a reserve is a core aspect of warfare. I don't think they have that reserve, and I'm not just talking of units not engaged, but of the reserves to sustain, over the long haul those things.  \n\n\nUntil they really look at a long war, where the new brigade stands up now, and hits the field in 2025 (A 2 years from order to start, to the point it could be deployable is a reasonable, abet short timeframe), we will keep circling it around to this issue. \n\nI don't know for sure, but I don't think, personally Ukraine has thought about, or accepts the fact this is going to be a very long war.

I noticed that myself while I trained Iraqi Security Forces during the GWOT, the problem was systemic then and with the Afghans too. I've heard tons of similar issues training both Koreans and Vietnamese in the past too. It's why the premier military units meant to work with foreign forces require language skills (SF, SFAB). Now the issue is coming up again training Ukrainians, no surprise, because having to teach through a translator, often a civilian contractor who does a terrible job (especially since so much of the discussion is filled with jargon, acronyms, idioms, etc), is the least effective way to teach. It basically guarantees mediocrity at best. \n\nThe biggest issue, above all else, neither Canadians or other NATO forces can train Ukrainians how to fight like the Ukrainians want to be taught, because they are totally different militaries with different doctrine, TTPs, SOPs, equipment, culture, etc. Even if enough high level Canadian military Ukraine speakers could be found for each job, then they need to be first taught how the UAF does things to an expert degree. So now we're talking about an army of NATO trainers from sergeant to colonel needing years of language classes to replicate what can be done within a few months if the UA govt agrees to take charge. It's just way easier to just have the Ukrainians do it all, not just instructors duties but also writing the training plans, designing the training modules, etc. \n\nUkrainian officers and NCOs will do a much better job with enforcing their kind of discipline, morale, \"Why we fight\" type of stuff, besides having the extra trust from being combat vets from the actual war being fought, fellow countrymen, can't be replicated by western trainers, no matter how motivated they might be to help. \n\nAlso, with this being a long war, Ukraine NEEDS to start rotating its combat troops out of the fight for non-combat duties, if only for 6-12 month stints. If they don't, morale will drop when everyone starts realizing they are serving in combat until they are casualties. Additionally, it'll help with reducing combat stress, as permanent psych casualties are going to become an ever increasing problem as this war progresses. Instructor duty can't be the only jobs in the rear created for combat veteran officers and NCOs to give them a break, but it's a perfect place to put them. \n\nAdditionally, invalid troops who can't physically do their job but can still serve. A good instructor needs to walk, talk, see and hear, that's about it, the rest can be done by an assistant. \n\nLastly, this is the perfect time to set up a legit NCO corps by establishing squad leader courses that then feed into the basic training courses where they can serve as assistant instructors for a bit before going back to the line in Ukraine. The best place to learn how to lead is by leading, but the worst place to learn by doing is in combat where the cost of error is blood.",

It basically guarantees mediocrity at best. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue, above all else, neither Canadians or other NATO forces can train Ukrainians how to fight like the Ukrainians want to be taught, because they are totally different militaries with different doctrine, TTPs, SOPs, equipment, culture, etc. Even if enough high level Canadian military Ukraine speakers could be found for each job, then they need to be first taught how the UAF does things to an expert degree. So now we&#39;re talking about an army of NATO trainers from sergeant to colonel needing years of language classes to replicate what can be done within a few months if the UA govt agrees to take charge. It&#39;s just way easier to just have the Ukrainians do it all, not just instructors duties but also writing the training plans, designing the training modules, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officers and NCOs will do a much better job with enforcing their kind of discipline, morale, &quot;Why we fight&quot; type of stuff, besides having the extra trust from being combat vets from the actual war being fought, fellow countrymen, can&#39;t be replicated by western trainers, no matter how motivated they might be to help. </p>\n\n<p>Also, with this being a long war, Ukraine NEEDS to start rotating its combat troops out of the fight for non-combat duties, if only for 6-12 month stints. If they don&#39;t, morale will drop when everyone starts realizing they are serving in combat until they are casualties. Additionally, it&#39;ll help with reducing combat stress, as permanent psych casualties are going to become an ever increasing problem as this war progresses. Instructor duty can&#39;t be the only jobs in the rear created for combat veteran officers and NCOs to give them a break, but it&#39;s a perfect place to put them. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, invalid troops who can&#39;t physically do their job but can still serve. A good instructor needs to walk, talk, see and hear, that&#39;s about it, the rest can be done by an assistant. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, this is the perfect time to set up a legit NCO corps by establishing squad leader courses that then feed into the basic training courses where they can serve as assistant instructors for a bit before going back to the line in Ukraine. The best place to learn how to lead is by leading, but the worst place to learn by doing is in combat where the cost of error is blood.</p>\n</div>",

Silently before and once again openly after the election. \u201cThere is no other way.\u201d\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Ukraine\u2019s biggest problem is manpower. \u201cThey need capable fighters more urgent than they need western arms. They are losing their best. NATO training so far is not sufficient enough.\u201d\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f The Russian army is getting stronger, not weaker. \u201cThey learned from their mistakes.

A year ago Russia was still fighting to hold on to untenable positions supplied along fragile, overstretched lines. The mere act of realistically assessing what objectives can be achieved right away, and coming up with the force generation structure that enabled them changed the efficiency of their campaign tremendously. For the first few months of their three-day special military operation Russia barely had *any* realistic force generation plans.\n\nSo I don't think it's an unrealistic assessment that RuAF got stronger. They got to plan for defending better-chosen positions, with a real long-term plan in place. That's enough to make any army stronger, even without it gaining significant new capabilities, which RuAF actually did gain.\n\nBesides, the discussion is obviously focused on the Ukrainian theatre. It's hard to think that a stronger Russia would've thrown away years of CSTO work, for example, the way they've thrown it away in the last year. And their strategic position, both against their current doctrinal enemies (NATO) and against potential realistic enemies (China) is significantly worse, if only because of their increased diplomatic isolation and foreign dependence and the degraded strategic status in the Baltic Sea. But it's certainly plausible that Russia may have shifted resources in one theatre so as to increase its operational efficiency (and strength) even if its overall strategic situation may be worse on paper.\n\nI don't follow the operational structure of the two forces in enough detail (and even if I did, I don't think I have sufficient relevant, modern expertise) to say if the overall analysis is correct.

And everything will fall into place,&quot; Kovalchuk added.</a> Kovalchuk&#39;s brother is believed to be one of the few people still very close to Putin.     </p>\n\n<p>This comes several days after notorious hawk Sergey Karaganov <a href=\"https://twitter.com/walberque/status/1706694059358646392\">published an article advocating for significantly liberalizing the Russian nuclear doctrine, and going as far as deploying nuclear weapons against European NATO countries to &quot;prevent World War III&quot;.</a>    </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there are reports that for the first time Russia will conduct country-wide (as opposed to previously only regional) drills simulating a scenario where &quot;general mobilization has been completed in Russia, martial law has been imposed in a number of regions, and in some regions the population&#39;s life support facilities and up to 70% of the housing were completely destroyed and there was a threat of &quot;radioactive contamination zones&quot;&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>moscowtimes. ru/2023/09/28/povsei-rossii-provedut-ucheniya-nasluchai-yadernoi-voini-a108369</p>\n</div>",

Not only that, but the Ukrainian gains are very narrow, and require the taking of additional territory around Verbove and Kopani just to reduce the risk of a Russian counteroffensive being able to surround their forward units before Ukrainian forces will be able to even attempt a further advance towards Tokmak. Russian forces have also spent the last few months further fortifying the territory between Ukrainian forces and Tokmak, making future gains even more costly. \n\nIt's hard to know the exact state of both forces, who appear to have suffered significant losses in men and materiel, but its safe to say Ukraine has borne the brunt of losses considering the nature of the offensive. They're going to struggle to replace the losses of experienced men and Western kit expended in the offensive, let alone make up for the tremendous amount of ammunition they've expended these last few months. Western leaders are unlikely to be happy with the results achieved based on the cost, raising the risks of reduced or insufficient Western support over the coming months and years. \n\nIt increasingly looks to me that Ukraine had a golden opportunity in late 2022 and early 2023 to actually make the kinds of gains this offensive was supposed to achieve, and that for a variety of reasons, they were unable to do so. Had DPICMS been provided earlier, the Russian advances around Bakhmut likely would've not only been more costly, but they might have failed altogether. Had Western tanks and IFVs been approved and supplied months earlier, they would've been ready for a Winter/Spring Ukrainian offensive. Had the Ukrainians equipped their veteran units with this gear rather than raw recruits, they would've been far more effective. And had the Ukrainians launched an offensive earlier, Russia wouldn't have had 6+ months of uninterrupted time to build dense fortifications miles deep, manned by well-rested troops, stacked with literally tens of millions of mines. \n\nBut thats not what happened, so instead, Ukraine launched a poorly planned, poorly led offensive across too many fronts simultaneously against dense Russian defensive fortifications, over open ground, through massive minefields, using green troops without remotely enough training and with little to no unit cohesion, which led to entirely predictable results. Not only that, but the primary objective of the offensive was known to everyone long in advance, allowing Russian forces to strike Ukrainian troops while they concentrated for those first doomed assaults, and giving Russia ample time to properly organize their forces to meet the offensive. \n\nWhat's worse is that there's no easy fix for the problems that Ukraine now faces not just on the Southern front, but across the entire line of contact. Russian forces are well-entrenched pretty much everywhere, and only further improving their defenses while Ukraine lacks enough properly trained/experienced assault infantry to quickly take fortified positions. Ukraine doesn't have enough mineclearing equipment, let alone troops properly trained to clear minefields under fire. Russian counterbattery fire using Lancets, Krasnopols, and guided rockets continues to improve significantly. Production of Russian FPV drones has risen dramatically, with noticeable effects on the battlefield and no effective Ukrainian counter. Russian longrange PGMs are growing in availability too, with their \"JDAM\" equivalents being used by the dozens on a daily basis at this point while Ukraine has no means to properly counter them. \n\nWith the Ukrainian counteroffensive having failed to achieve its objectives, it seems likely that were going to see a full-fledged war of attrition with neither side capable of effectively breaking through the opposing frontline over the coming months and years.

The granularity of how we got there, however, is where there could be debate.  \n\nFor example, on the point of Bakhmut, it's become really fashionable on this sub to say that Ukraine made a mistake by staying there for too long. As a novice, I agree with that conclusion as well. However, what was \"too late\"? Lee, as an example, posits sometime around February. Kofman seems to imply perhaps as late as March. However, no one was saying that it was too late to hold Bakhmut *before* U.S. intelligence came to that conclusion in early-mid January. No one on this sub, not Kofman, not Watling. And not even the best analyst on these matters, Freedman (who, in fairness, is retired but *is* still covering the war.) Therefore, if February/March were the timelines for pulling back these experienced troops, and Ukraine was supposed to launch a *spring* offensive, where was the time for rest and refit before getting thrown into the heaviest fighting against an entrenched enemy as early as April/May? And as you pointed out, waiting longer was not an option. \n\nPutting aside this Hobson's choice, it's also questionable to what extent training is to blame, and to what extent poor tactics are to blame, and to what extent bad execution and dumb luck are to blame. Obviously each play a part. For example, we have reporting that the Ukrainians messed up the June 4^th attack because of 1) poor communication leading to the artillery barrage not lining up with equipment movement, and 2) *them making a wrong turn onto a non-demined field*. Is it possible they could have overcome to latter without the former, or the former without the latter? We'll never know. \n\nBut something to keep in mind is Watling's reporting that he personally observed experienced U.S. troops fail a breaching operation repeatedly during exercises. It's supposedly the \"most complex operation that an army can conduct.\" Therefore, perhaps the real failure here was poor expectations management on the Ukrainians end. Again, that's not to disagree with your end conclusion, but it's important to contextualize these events from a much higher vantage point than from a granular level. Either way, what matters most now is to figure out the best way forward, and that, per experts such as Freedman and Kofman, is to focus on training, enablers and sustainment. It's not just doable, it's very doable if the will is there. And as someone who has been in favor of a negotiated outcome from the very get, it's *extremely important to recognize that what's happening in Washington matters a heck of a lot more than what happens on some field in Ukraine.* That's not just Congress either. That's down to how Treasury, DOJ and DOC manage sanctions. That's how the Pentagon scales up 155mm and GMLRS production. That's the procrastinating on purchase orders and funding for critical companies such as AJRD. Doubly so for Europe.",

Had DPICMS been provided earlier, the Russian advances around Bakhmut likely would've not only been more costly, but they might have failed altogether. Had Western tanks and IFVs been approved and supplied months earlier, they would've been ready for a Winter/Spring Ukrainian offensive. \n\nThe timelines don't match, nor were there realistic readiness capabilities to pull that off. \n\nTo achieve the success it did in fall 2022, the UAF started prepping for major strategic offensives in the spring, according to Jack Watling of RUSI it was as far back as April. \n\nThey were launching counteroffensives already by late April in Kharkiv (though entirely with local forces) and then late May in the Kherson Bridgehead (I think they committed some newly built brigades to that one). The former was roughly a bit over a division at the start (more units were sent afterwards), while the latter was roughly [corps sized](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWTMiLoXgAEuw-h.jpg). \n\nAll through the summer they were rotating in more and more units to Donbas as well, including a whole lot of early war paper brigades that were beefed up after the mobilization started, or those reconstituted following first-phase invasion losses, plus a bunch of new units created after the war started. Those are who were able to form the defense in depth along the Siversk-Bakhmut Line and keep the Russians from breaching the northern line too, as well as reinforcing other regions. \n\nIn terms of foreign aid, the UAF didn't get true Western tanks and IFV until 2023, but they were [still getting lots of COMBLOC equipment since approx April 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War). That equipment allowed them not only to grow in size but also to force regenerate after losses. \n\nWhile the UAF was beefing up the Donbas, plus reinforcing Kharkiv due to the see-saw nature of that front, and while attacking in Kherson, they were building up a strategic reserve that largely got used in Kherson for the big \"Southern Offensive\" being highly telegraphed since July. Meanwhile, the Kharkiv Counteroffensive was nearly entirely carried out by local forces who had been fighting for months, the five assault brigades had all been on the line in the Kharkiv or Donbas front already, none were fresh.  \n\nThen the UAF went on the offensive again in Kherson at a larger scale in late August leading to a slow, casualty heavy meatgrinder affair for months on end, only ending when the Russians retreated in mid November. Many of those units were quite battered. But afterwards, few got pulled into the strategic rear, instead sent to reinforce the defense of Bakhmut, where they got chewed up. As for the rest of the force, nearly everyone else were either attacking the Svatove Kreminna Line in Oct-Nov, or defending Bakhmut. The former cooled off as the mud season went into full effect, but mostly it was because the Ukrainians were utterly exhausted. \n\nSo how do Abrams, Leopards, Bradleys, Marders, and DPICM suddenly give them the ability to capitalize on the Kharkiv victory (the only one that was truly dangerous to the Russians) to end the war by winter 2023? \n\nMore so, with the thousands of AFV they were given over 2022, along with the millions of artillery rounds, plus supposedly Turkish DPICM since November '22, how come that didn't help? \n\nI think the reality was the UAF was exhausted by the late fall and definitely into the winter, they never got to really recover from the invasion, they'd been on the limited offensive periodically all spring and summer, plus fighting a major meatgrinder defense that was made worse by the use of positional defense strategy, and then going on a two-front offensive from September-November involving pretty much every offensively capable unit they possessed. Not just low on artillery ammo, or needing more AFV, but they were close to the breaking point when it came to personnel strength. \n\nMilitarily, there was no real way to win. There was no great encirclement possible in the East, nor any real means for a fast positional warfare approach to force the Russians tro retreat. The only way they could have won was breaking Russia's and Putin's personal resolve to force a capitulation of some degree to get a ceasefire favorable to Ukraine, which had an extremely slim chance of happening despite pretty much everyone hoping it would happen and basing their strategy on it. Very unlikely. \n\nThat said, yeah, DPICM would have been nice over the winter 2023 when the Ukrainians were literally begging for them, not to win the war but to hold ground without such heavy losses.

                "body": "> I\u2019d be very happy if someone provided a realistic counter to this view.\n\nI can try one, but please note that this is obviously a devil's advocate sort of thing :-).\n\nI don't disagree that piggybacking on top of a long-winded war can be a sound strategy for nationalist leaders in general. But, selective though Putin's display (and maybe even understanding) of Russian history may be, it's not at all clear to me that he'd bank on that particular option, which has had significant potential for power disruption even in recent history. For instance, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which wasn't even as costly as the one in Ukraine, had its cost spread over a longer period, and was carried out with troops from all over the Union, not just Russia (about a quarter of the servicemen in Afghanistan were Ukrainian, for instance), proved remarkably disruptive to Soviet society and, ultimately, for Soviet central power.\n\nBesides, it's not like he needed a war to dismantle democratic institutions or muster internal support before. The Russian electorate has responded much better (and much more predictably) to steady financial status improvement, which Russia has been able to achieve with considerable less effort, and under much more favourable foreign trade conditions, before they torpedoed some (though, admitedly, not all) of their most lucrative commercial partnerships.\n\nMaybe it makes for a reasonable plan C, now that plan A (\"we'll be at the Polish border in a matter of days and they'll beg us to stop there\") and plan B (\"the collective West will grow tired of this in a matter of months and we'll bomb them back to stone age\") are dead and buried.\n\nThere is merit to the idea that Russia, a single party that can rely on its few partners' enmity towards Ukraine's primary supporters, may be able to outwait Ukraine's multiple partners with more divergent agendas and ultimately gain the upper hand against the scarcer human and economic resources Ukraine has. But I doubt someone as anxious and fearful as Putin *desires* this, or ever planned for it.\n\nEven if Putin was convinced it's an ironclad plan that can't fail, a swift, decisive victory would afford him at least as much, if not even more support, and consolidate his position to the point where dismantling whatever democratic mechanisms are left wouldn't be problematic at all. Not that there are too many left; IMHO that ship has sailed cca. 2016, and whatever ostensibly democratic mechanisms remain (e.g. a parliament that nominally exercises parliamentary control over the executive) are instruments of central power, rather than working, independent mechanisms, and dismantling them would actually be counter-productive.\n\nIt's also not yet clear that Russia's current economic well-being is sustainable, even assuming said well-being is as uniform, solid, and extensive as Russian official channels claim to be, which isn't implausible, but also not easily verifiable, given how much data Russia authorities withhold.\n\nThis is particularly difficult to assess when talking about long-term conflicts. It's tempting to look at numbers only in terms of whether or not Russian economy and industry can support the operational demands of the war, which is fine over short enough periods (6-12 months), but begins to break down under the pressure of long-term uncertainty. Over longer timeframes you need to start thinking about other contingencies, from natural disasters to international economy, or just plain old strategic competition, one of the many nails in the Soviet Union's coffin. Carrying out immediate economic engagements (e.g. paying short-term loans) and avoiding immediate supply chain shortages for widely-available consumer goods is absolutely not easy and Russia has handled that well so far, but it's not necessarily indicative of their ability to handle longer-term economic turmoil.\n\nSo IMHO:\n\n1. While this is an end-state that the current Russian political establishment may hope they can manage, it doesn't necessarily mean it's an end-state they view as desireable, or even as *a* favourable option. The fact that they do indeed signal that they think they can manage it is not a very useful indication. It's not like they can go out and say that if it gets to that, they're screwed.\n2. It's not at all clear that the Russian financial establishment can offer sufficient guarantees to central policymakers (i.e. Putin and his immediate circle, as well as potential contenders) that the current state of economic well-being is sustainable over a long enough period of time. Whether or not it actually is sustainable isn't immediately, or isn't *primarily* relevant -- the point is whether there's sufficient faith in it at the higher echelons of the political establishment, as that's what ultimately dictates policy. Public signaling is, again, a largely useless indicator. Russia can't have Peskov go live and say we gotta do something N months from now or we go bankrupt, even if that were provably the case -- if they did that, the only message it would send is Ukraine has to hold out N + 1 months and then it's largely a matter of ensuring the nukes stay with the guys in uniform, which the world has prior experience with.\n\nIn other words, I don't think your argument is structurally incorrect (it's literally the opposite, I think it's a coherent scenario), but I don't think there's enough public evidence to make it *likely*, rather than just plausible.",

Long term Ukraine is going to face massive problems both militarily and socially with a demographic collapse. Ukraine has roughly half the number of women between 20-40 they had 10 years ago. Essentially the shortage of people is going to be a major issue for Ukraine both short term and for many decades to come. This helps secure Russia&#39;s war aim of ensuring that Ukraine is too weak to join NATO.</p>\n</div>",
