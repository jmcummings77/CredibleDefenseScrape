Officials caution it'll take weeks to build port and deliver aid. The move suggests a shift in strategy for US.

All were granted anonymity to preview the president\u2019s announcement\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The aid will initially flow through the Larnaca port in Cyprus, located about 230 miles from Gaza. It\u2019s already fitted with high-tech screening equipment that allows Israeli officials stationed in Cyprus to check what\u2019s inside the deliveries.  \n>  \n>The aid needs to be protected once it\u2019s ashore, and crowds clamoring for assistance have to be managed. U.S. officials said Israel has not yet agreed to a security and crowd-control mission on the beachhead and that negotiations are ongoing, including whether Israeli forces would also be responsible for demining staging areas for the aid.  \n>  \n>Arguably the hardest part is dispersing the aid throughout the whole of Gaza. The multinational coalition will rely on the United Nations, non-governmental organizations and other groups to ensure the assistance gets to the right places.\n\n\\---\n\nMore details emerging:\n\n[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news/us-gaza-aid?smid=url-share): Army's 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary) to be one of the main units.\n\n>The project could take more than 30 to 60 days, according to defense officials, and would involving hundreds or thousands of U.S. troops on ships just off shore  \n>  \n>The Army Corps of Engineers has long experience in the rapid construction of floating docks to accommodate U.S. military operations. One of the main military units involved in the construction will be the Army\u2019s 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), out of Joint Base Eustis-Langley, Va., near Norfolk, according to U.S. Defense Department officials.\n\n\\---\n\n[Brief comments](https://x.com/Dave_Harden/status/1765807425469169717?s=20) from the former head of USAID in the region, Dave Harden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The US will, in essence, own the port - which de-leverages the influence of Netanyahu and his right wing ministers to block aid. This port also sets up an interesting potential for a post-war Gaza to trade outside of the previous sole crossing point, Karem Shalom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n(Leaving my original thoughts here, some of which are now less than relevant)\n\nThis (understatement) seems like a large development. I would think this would need to involve actual US Military forces on the ground within Gaza in order to secure and actually carry out the construction.\n\nRecently there has also been discussion about the deployment of one of the hospital ships, with the major issues being both time and the need to have a secure way to transport patients to the ship. Perhaps this could help with the latter.\n\nVery curious what the forces involved in this will look like. I'd imagine Seabees for the actual work to build out the port. I'm not familiar with their structure. Are they self sustaining including security? What other forces are likely to accompany them?\n\nThe clam that this doesn't require \"boots on the ground\" seems fascinating.\n\nAnd what reactions could we see from Hamas or other groups? Many of which have a history of interfering with aid distribution.\n\n(Sorry if tweets aren't allowed, first time actually posting something here, but this seems significant)",

Biden has grown frustrated with Netanyahu as the crisis has gotten more dire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1765785363111428389?s=20\">https://x.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1765785363111428389?s=20</a></p>\n\n<p>Additional details (Axios)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Biden will announce at his \u201cState of the Union\u201d speech that he ordered the U.S. military to conduct an \u201cemergency mission\u201d to establish a temporary port in Gaza that would open up a maritime route for humanitarian assistance from Cyprus, U.S. officials said</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Charles_Lister/status/1765791666034643121?s=20\">https://twitter.com/BarakRavid/status/1765784774918955482</a></p>\n\n<p>Politico: <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/07/biden-building-port-in-gaza-to-deliver-aid-00145636\">https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/07/biden-building-port-in-gaza-to-deliver-aid-00145636</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. military has \u201cunique capabilities\u201d that allow it to construct a port or causeway without having to send forces to Gaza\u2019s shores, said one of the officials. \u201cWe\u2019re not planning for this to be an operation that would require U.S. boots on the ground,\u201d said a second one. All were granted anonymity to preview the president\u2019s announcement</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The aid will initially flow through the Larnaca port in Cyprus, located about 230 miles from Gaza. It\u2019s already fitted with high-tech screening equipment that allows Israeli officials stationed in Cyprus to check what\u2019s inside the deliveries.  </p>\n\n<p>The aid needs to be protected once it\u2019s ashore, and crowds clamoring for assistance have to be managed. U.S. officials said Israel has not yet agreed to a security and crowd-control mission on the beachhead and that negotiations are ongoing, including whether Israeli forces would also be responsible for demining staging areas for the aid.  </p>\n\n<p>Arguably the hardest part is dispersing the aid throughout the whole of Gaza. The multinational coalition will rely on the United Nations, non-governmental organizations and other groups to ensure the assistance gets to the right places.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>More details emerging:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news/us-gaza-aid?smid=url-share\">NYT</a>: Army&#39;s 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary) to be one of the main units.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The project could take more than 30 to 60 days, according to defense officials, and would involving hundreds or thousands of U.S. troops on ships just off shore  </p>\n\n<p>The Army Corps of Engineers has long experience in the rapid construction of floating docks to accommodate U.S. military operations. One of the main military units involved in the construction will be the Army\u2019s 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), out of Joint Base Eustis-Langley, Va., near Norfolk, according to U.S. Defense Department officials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/Dave_Harden/status/1765807425469169717?s=20\">Brief comments</a> from the former head of USAID in the region, Dave Harden.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The US will, in essence, own the port - which de-leverages the influence of Netanyahu and his right wing ministers to block aid. This port also sets up an interesting potential for a post-war Gaza to trade outside of the previous sole crossing point, Karem Shalom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>(Leaving my original thoughts here, some of which are now less than relevant)</p>\n\n<p>This (understatement) seems like a large development. I would think this would need to involve actual US Military forces on the ground within Gaza in order to secure and actually carry out the construction.</p>\n\n<p>Recently there has also been discussion about the deployment of one of the hospital ships, with the major issues being both time and the need to have a secure way to transport patients to the ship. Perhaps this could help with the latter.</p>\n\n<p>Very curious what the forces involved in this will look like. I&#39;d imagine Seabees for the actual work to build out the port. I&#39;m not familiar with their structure. Are they self sustaining including security? What other forces are likely to accompany them?</p>\n\n<p>The clam that this doesn&#39;t require &quot;boots on the ground&quot; seems fascinating.</p>\n\n<p>And what reactions could we see from Hamas or other groups? Many of which have a history of interfering with aid distribution.</p>\n\n<p>(Sorry if tweets aren&#39;t allowed, first time actually posting something here, but this seems significant)</p>\n</div>",

Lazia is located about halfway between Myitkyina and Bhamo towns, near the border with China.\n\n>The outposts protect the junta\u2019s strategic military bases along the 120-mile route through Bhamo and Waingmaw townships.\n\n>**Troops from Kachin People\u2019s Defense Forces (PDFs) and the KIA also used rocket-propelled bombs to attack the runway of the airport in Bhamo and the junta airbase in Myitkyina Thursday morning to prevent aircraft from defending the junta outposts it later attacked**, Kachin media reported.\n\nAttacks against airports are very uncommon. Wonder what their EW situation is like at these bases as well. Might be an opportunity for drones. \n\nThis ongoing offensive aims to cut the highway between Bhamo and Myitkyina as well as further secure their territory.

At this rate, it would take around 20 years to clear 4,700 km2. Assuming all 174,000 km2 of Ukrainian territory affected by combat is contaminated, it would take 757 years to clear all affected areas with such a human resource capacity.*\n\n*The Defense Ministry says that overall, 7,686.75 hectares of terrain, 7,622.25 hectares of farmland, 19.45 km of roads, and 0.3 km of pipelines were inspected and cleared last week.

The partnership agreement was signed between Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Palantir executives during a visit to the UK, the Ministry says.*\n\n*The collaboration will leverage Palantir\u2019s AI platform to digitize, coordinate, and accelerate demining operations. Key goals include clearing land faster and at lower costs. The AI assistant will integrate and analyze demining data to provide recommendations for process improvements. This encompasses prioritizing regions, adopting new methods like drones, and managing risk.*\n\n*The databases will contain both static and operational information. Static data will evaluate the economic efficiency of agricultural land and the proximity of contaminated areas to communications.

Baur's algorithm, trained on the visual characteristics of 70 types of land mines, cluster munitions, and other unexploded ordnance, processes the images into a map, with resolution down to a fraction of an inch. The model can then recognize and map explosives more quickly and accurately than a human reviewing the same images. \u201cIn a matter of minutes you'll have a map plotted out with where all the land-mine detections are,\u201d Baur says.*\n\n*With a reported detection rate of about 90 percent, the drones are meant to augment traditional methods, not replace them. \u201cIt's less comprehensive because you're not going through inch by inch,\u201d Baur says. But the approach can reveal potential dangers and can cover more ground than manual efforts.*\n\n*Baur and his team have visited Ukraine to test the technology multiple times since the start of the war there. They hope their work can speed up a demining process that, using current resources, could take more than 750 years. By some estimates, Ukraine has about 67,000 square miles (an area roughly the size of Florida) that could harbor mines and other explosives.

That was entirely due to systemic and cultural problems of mindset, mass-issued cheap drones aren't going to fix anything.\n\nFun fact: The first living recipient of a Medal of Honor since Vietnam was Salvatore Giunta, for services in Afghanistan in 2007. The action he was honored for occurred when his platoon was ambushed by the Taliban as they were leaving an overwatch position on a nearby ridgeline overlooking a village where their company leadership was in discussions with the local village elders.\n\nWhat were they talking about?\n\nThe 173rd company commander was trying to get the village elders help recovering 1x M4 Carbine (\\~$3k value with all the attachments) and 1x PVS-14 ($3k) lost the week before in another skirmish where a US Army paratrooper was killed and his body very briefly overrun by Taliban forces, long enough for them to grab his rifle and NODS and run off.\n\nAt which point the US Army company commander of a paratroop company in the worst area of Afghanistan had to launch multiple missions to try to find the lost items, because otherwise the captain would get his ass chewed and a bad officer evaluation report showing he was irresponsible with his equipment. That decision resulted in 2x KIA, 5x WIA in a platoon of \\~40 guys. Mind you, that captain is now a colonel and will soon be a general. \n\nThis problem has nothing to do with drones or cost of anything. The US military flips their shit if someone loses any sensitive item equipment, and that's a direct carry over to peacetime garrison mentality from the 80-90s. Anyone who has ever served in the US Army or Marines has a billion stories of absurd length to recover things of little to no real value, its just how the leadership thinks.\n\nThe answer to that isn't issuing garbage tech, it's to change the culture so leaders and especially commanders (who sign for everything) must understand that in combat waste is to be expected. They're going to lose rifles, NODS, drones, vehicles, people, etc. That doesn't mean the commander losing them is irresponsible, C'est La Guerre.",

The action he was honored for occurred when his platoon was ambushed by the Taliban as they were leaving an overwatch position on a nearby ridgeline overlooking a village where their company leadership was in discussions with the local village elders.</p>\n\n<p>What were they talking about?</p>\n\n<p>The 173rd company commander was trying to get the village elders help recovering 1x M4 Carbine (~$3k value with all the attachments) and 1x PVS-14 ($3k) lost the week before in another skirmish where a US Army paratrooper was killed and his body very briefly overrun by Taliban forces, long enough for them to grab his rifle and NODS and run off.</p>\n\n<p>At which point the US Army company commander of a paratroop company in the worst area of Afghanistan had to launch multiple missions to try to find the lost items, because otherwise the captain would get his ass chewed and a bad officer evaluation report showing he was irresponsible with his equipment. That decision resulted in 2x KIA, 5x WIA in a platoon of ~40 guys. Mind you, that captain is now a colonel and will soon be a general. </p>\n\n<p>This problem has nothing to do with drones or cost of anything. The US military flips their shit if someone loses any sensitive item equipment, and that&#39;s a direct carry over to peacetime garrison mentality from the 80-90s. Anyone who has ever served in the US Army or Marines has a billion stories of absurd length to recover things of little to no real value, its just how the leadership thinks.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to that isn&#39;t issuing garbage tech, it&#39;s to change the culture so leaders and especially commanders (who sign for everything) must understand that in combat waste is to be expected. They&#39;re going to lose rifles, NODS, drones, vehicles, people, etc. That doesn&#39;t mean the commander losing them is irresponsible, C&#39;est La Guerre.</p>\n</div>",

And both of those were when the country was in much better shape. \n\nA successful US-led intervention would need a minimum of 20,000 security personnel (troops, police, whatever) like the 1994 intervention. It would more likely be 30,000-50,000; I pull that number by drawing a comparison to the state I live in (Illinois) which is comparable in size and population with roughly 40k police officers. IIRC, the oft-debated formula for the number of troops to occupy a country came out to be similar. \n\nWhile a US led intervention of that magnitude would quickly reassert control over the country, the problem is that there are no systems in place to maintain that security. The Haitian National Police are at 9,000 and dropping; that's before the issue that some are complicit in working with the gangs or as muscle for politicians. It needs to quadruple in size before it could realistically maintain order. Actually, what probably needs to happen is that police duties need to devolve outside of just the HNP. Using the Illinois example again, police forces are split between the State Police, county Sheriff Departments, and city police. City police officers are the biggest number, but they're supported by the Sheriff and State Police as well. Building outward instead of just centralizing in the HNP would likely help, but how to do that would require me to do more research into the administrative structure of Haiti. One other benefit is that it would keep the NHP from getting coup happy, which was why the Haitian military was disbanded. \n\nSecurity is only one part of the equation, though, and the one that has been tried before that didn't provide great results. To be truly stable, Haitians need shelter, sanitation, and access to sustenance. That's a lot of reconstruction work that would need to be headed and funded by competent and ethical people. Unfortunately, that means it couldn't be by Haitians in a crumbling system that's being rebuilt. It would have to be outsider driven. Now, if there's one thing that Americans can do is build infrastructure (when funded), so that's not something that's really a technical hurdle. Bring in professional city administrators, engineers, and workers, and it will get built. But the bigger issue is that it would exclude Haitians from building their own country, which is a huge problem both ethically and financially. It would be imperialistic/colonialist. Granted, there are a lot of avenues to get input and buy in, but ultimately it would still be the US in charge. \n\nAll of the above would take a decade, and I didn't even address how to pay for it. Sure, aid going in would help, but what happens afterwards? How would Haiti be able to sustain those levels of service by tax revenue?

I suppose there will always be gaps in the drone surveillance because the batteries needed to maintain 12 hours watch will always be heavier than 2 MREs/day for a pair of eyeballs.

Seizing the assets or collateralizing the loan using the assets requires Y's claim to the assets to be legitimate.\n\n\n2. X believes said claim to be legitimate, but prior to any legal agreement to that effect, will have to risk either a) reputation (seizure) or b) their own money (not collateralizing the loan through Z's assets).\u00a0\n\n\n3.

But that shouldn't be a problem - if X was so certain that Z's assets actually belonged to Y, and that would be shown to be the case legally post-facto, then the commitment to use reparations as proceeds for paying back the loan should be equivalent to using the assets as collateral.\u00a0\n\n\nExcept that X isn't actually sure of that - and sure isn't willing to put sizable money down on it - which is why all of these discussions about the legality of using the Russian assets are so tiresome to read.\n\n\nWhat's being done is at best a PR exercise. It does not and cannot change any of the legal aspects related to the frozen assets.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can launch a public bond or give a sovereign loan conditioned on said instruments' being given priority and paid back from future reparations within the scope of the law, but you can't use somebody else's money as collateral until it stops being somebody else's money - it's that simple.\u00a0",

But that shouldn&#39;t be a problem - if X was so certain that Z&#39;s assets actually belonged to Y, and that would be shown to be the case legally post-facto, then the commitment to use reparations as proceeds for paying back the loan should be equivalent to using the assets as collateral.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Except that X isn&#39;t actually sure of that - and sure isn&#39;t willing to put sizable money down on it - which is why all of these discussions about the legality of using the Russian assets are so tiresome to read.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s being done is at best a PR exercise. It does not and cannot change any of the legal aspects related to the frozen assets.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can launch a public bond or give a sovereign loan conditioned on said instruments&#39; being given priority and paid back from future reparations within the scope of the law, but you can&#39;t use somebody else&#39;s money as collateral until it stops being somebody else&#39;s money - it&#39;s that simple.\u00a0</p>\n</div>",

The main points are a body made of styrofoam (!) and the price of $2,100.\n\nThe expected production is in the thousands, i.e. not that different from the Lancet production, which probably reached 3,000-4,000 last year. However, the Scalpel looks like an item whose production could be upscaled easily - after all that is exactly what it has been designed for.\n\n[https://ruavia](https://ruavia) . su/the-scalpel-barrage-munition-has-been-put-into-serial-production/\n\n>Strike unmanned platform Scalpel has been launched into serial production, and several thousand copies of the kamikaze drone will be produced by the end of this year. This is reported by TASS with reference to the Vostok design bureau \u2013 the developer and manufacturer of the platform.\n\n>\u201cWe will produce Scalpel in a very large series, by the end of 2024 we will reach production in the volume of thousands of copies of the product. The exact data is not disclosed, the count is in the thousands of products. Further \u201cScalpel\u201d will continue its life in the Russian army as a part of the complex with reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle,\u201d stated the Vostok design bureau.\n\n>The payload mass of the Scalpel kamikaze drone is 5kg, take-off weight is 10.5kg, cruising speed is 120km/h, range is 40km. The platform is an analogue of ZALA AERO\u2019s Lancet barrage munition.\n\n>The unmanned striking device Scalpel came for testing to the battalion Vostok in the special operation zone in September 2023. Based on the results of its use, the catapult from which the munition is launched was modernised. Previously, a rubber-propelled catapult was used, but it did not meet the payload requirements, and an option to use a pneumatic catapult was considered.\n\n>\u201cThe catapult has become more compact, easier to use, deploys three times faster. Also Scalpel received a new linkage. We are regularly improving, adjusting to new realities,\u201d said in the telegram channel of the Vostok battalion.\n\n>The cost of a kamikaze drone with a body made of polystyrene foam is 200 thousand rubles (\\~2100 EUR). Styrofoam is a widespread type of foam plastic, and it is usually called so in everyday life. Representatives of Design Bureau Vostok said that in the course of the tests in parallel work is being done to increase the range of the device, now it can fly more than 40 kilometres. Its low cost is explained by the use of cheap materials and simple manufacturing and assembly processes.\n\n>Alexander Khodakovsky (Skif), former commander of the Vostok battalion and deputy head of the Rosgvardiya in the DNR, said last December that the developers of the Scalpel were not competing with anyone, but were only trying to fill a vacant niche.\n\n>\u201cAnd we will not allow the price of the product to increase in mass production. If the price of the Scalpel even just doubles \u2013 that\u2019s it, the point is lost,\u201d Skif says.\n\n>According to him, in early 2023, when the idea to create a cheap strike UAV was born, there were difficulties in co-operation with leading drone manufacturers. They were demonstrating the product and its ability to fly kamikaze at high altitude for long periods of time, but the cost of the product was beyond all reasonable limits. Flying at low altitudes proved unprofitable due to the high cost and the high probability of being shot down.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity to lower it to the height where it can be shot down with a machine gun. But you\u2019ll have to lower it! How are you going to do reconnaissance when you\u2019re above the clouds? We have them in three seasons of the year \u2013 low clouds! And it turns out that huge teams, for huge sums of money, create a product that cannot be used at the front,\u201d he explained.\n\n>The main idea behind the Scalpel during its development is the cheapness of the product, its mass availability, and the ability to effectively defeat artillery and VFU MLRS at a distance of 30-40 kilometres from the front line, where our counter-battery weapons cannot reach. The kamikaze drone works in conjunction with a reconnaissance UAV. The long time of kamikaze flight allows it to stay in the air waiting for the coordinates of the target to be received and immediately after the operator\u2019s command, to attack it.",
