In such conditions, an infantryman is almost a super soldier, who has to sit in a single trench for a long time under shelling, gas and FPV attacks, move at night in camouflage cloaks, keeping a distance, have technical means such as nettle tablets [tablets with a special software that allow to navigate the terrain, specify targets, interact with artillery/mortar/UAV teams, view future weather conditions, etc. etc.], DJI Mini or trench REB [anti-drone EW systems], and be able to move by compass when everything is off.\n\n>This requires both theoretical and practical training, as well as psychological preparation.

The increase in reconnaissance, accuracy of fires and their promptness forced a change in approach in the disposition of infantry, both in attack and in defense. Mind you - this is by no means to be understood in the sense that infantry is not or barely needed today (far from it!), or that there are no longer gunfights, use of fixed machine guns, or close-quarters fighting within a trench system. However, the new innovations have led to the need to reduce infantry on the so-called \"zero line\" (both because of the shortage of it on the Ukrainian side and also to lose as few people as possible).\n\nLet's make an example: in the Ukrainian trenches located along the Donets-Donbas Canal near Chasiv Yar, which are now the front line, there are actually very few men - and usually in dugouts, who come out when their command (thanks to UAV recon) warns them that enemy vehicles or infantry have been detected and are approaching the positions; or they are directly in sheltered observation posts. Almost the entire brigade is deployed in depth, in the buildings and in the forests in the immediate or in the further rear (and still in small groups, given the risks posed by the KABs). \n\nBecause of grenade-dropping and FPV drones, compared to past wars, soldiers now have to defend themselves also and especially from the sky, and be covered from it; the introduction of thermal imaging drones has distorted the role of the night as the soldier's friend, to carry out rotations, evacuate the WIAs, receive supplies, improve/build trenches, lay barbed wire, etc. Numerous interviews conducted over the recent months with servicemen of the UAF (like [this one](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-offensive-aid-16e276766b7100485fe97b674700ac6c)) clearly state that a very important share of casualties nowadays occur during rotations (at the squad/platoon level), which must be limited in their number and made as efficient as possible. At night one must drive very fast and with headlights off, wearing a night vision tool, and so on.\n\nFinally, the importance of proper training is emphasized and the current lack of it (a widespread condition) is criticized. I had written several times recently about the difference between brigades that train recruits within their unit, once they arrive from the training center, and those that send them immediately to the \"zero line\". Of course, there is also almost always a marked gap in terms of performance between these brigades. A positive example of what's described in this post is, in my opinion, the 79th Air Assault Brigade (easily in the podium of the best performing Ukrainian brigades from the fall onward), which supported by several battalions from infantry or TDF brigades has been managing to inflict as much damage (human and material) as possible on the Russians in the Kurakhove sector - losing ground but in a limited and controlled manner (without creating emergencies), against a Russian grouping much larger and far more equipped than the Ukrainian one.

You inspired me to go to my &quot;library&quot; and take a look at IISS&#39; The Military Balance 2024 which states that the US Army, including ARNG, possesses about 4,700 M113A2/A3 with approximately another 8,000 in storage. For the sake of completeness I looked at Bradley numbers as well which are comparatively much lower at 2,100 M2A2/A3s and 240 M2A4 out of storage and another 2,000 or so of unknown variant in storage. The condition of the units in storage is definitely a factor but it seems like there&#39;s the potential for a lot more aid.</p>\n</div>",

For this reason, the next stage was to use Fasces/bound bundle of wooden rods again. In (small number of) <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-builds-barricades-digs-trenches-focus-shifts-defence-2024-01-11/\">pictures of trenches</a> in Ukraine, you often see exactly these too perfect trenches. Is there a reason for this besides (probably) easier production of wodden slats?</p>\n\n<p>Even if it&#39;s obvious the importance of large (barbed-) wire systems and multi-layered trenches to stop/slow down infantry-heavy attacks is emphasised. The question here is how can it be that Ukraine is even <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210812-ukraine-sends-barbed-wire-to-lithuania-for-belarus-border\">donating 38 tonnes of barbed wire to Lithuania</a> instead of continuing to (easily?) reinforce its own lines? In the link above you can see a single line of barbed wire that is probably unlikely to hold off the infantry for long.</p>\n</div>",

Granted many of the systems required for Ukraine versus the systems required for Australian operations in the second island chain and strikes into the south china sea are not mutually exclusive, but any complain about Australian aid amounts has to consider a couple of distinct factors influencing our aid commitments.\n\nFirstly Australia has an incredibly small and atrophied land force with virtually no inventory of anything. For example until the glorious expansion of the Australian Army takes effect and we are in possession of new equipment, the whole Army has a whopping 60 tanks (growing to a fearsome 150 including training, engineering and recovery vehicles), a fleet of helicopters that don\u2019t work (eventually to be replaced by Apache) and by don\u2019t work I mean they crash to the extent that even the Defence Minister\u2019s son was killed flying in one of them (edit: son died in parachuting accident, the taipan crash killing four was a separate incident.) and a handful of towed artillery. We don\u2019t have any SPAGs or tube artillery. We have IFVs Boxers and APCs M113s and Hawkei and these have been sent, but numbers remain small and large contributions would rapidly de motorise our Infantry. We do however have an incresing volume of artillery shell ammunition which we have been producing and exporting, with I think a goal of reaching 300,000 155mm production almost all of which would be exportable given our minute artillery park. (If I recall correctly Army was getting assistance from France and Korea to scale that production)\n\nSecondly, shit\u2019s expensive and replacements of inventory takes time. The priority for funding allocation is AUKUS. Nuclear powered submarines which are fucking expensive, upgrades to port facilities and basing arrangements, creation of an east coast submarine port, long range strike missiles with domestic production (I think this was for JASSAM-ER or Tomahawk), development of long range drone programs, and the expansion of our priority forces in the RAN and RAAF through the acquisition of F-35, P8s, the recent acquisition of two LHDs, 3 destroyers and orders for a number of frigates and replenishment ships. Add in future plays in the NGAD, a fleet of 13 drone ships, possible increases in F35 numbers and rumours of a play in B21 Raider. Australia is spending a fuck ton of money catching up on its peace dividend. But most of those systems are not Ukraine compatible, and the land systems remain the red headed step child of Australian strategic policy.\n\nPlus with Washington asleep at the wheel for literal decades in the pacific its been up to Australia to singlehandedly compete against China in the football, immigration, and bribery olympics that is the second and third island chains of the south west Pacific.
