The proliferation of drones makes it seem like there is no chance of recovering a vehicle that has been immobilized. No amount of extra passive or active defenses will save you from a swarm of drones trying to blow up your detracked T-90M or Leopard. \n\nI was also thinking about next generation vehicles for this. Obviously this can not be retrofitted on existing designs. But newer designs seem to be moving towards rubber tracks and hybrid or diesel electric drive.

But for things that should be able to take a hit (MBT/heavy IFV) it seems like a glaring weak point.

No amount of extra passive or active defenses will save you from a swarm of drones trying to blow up your detracked T-90M or Leopard. </p>\n\n<p>I was also thinking about next generation vehicles for this.

I realize that it's almost impossible to use these in mud season, but for the drier seasons they might have an advantage.\n\nThere was a thread related to this in /r/WarCollege lately: [Do 6x6 vehicles have better survivability than 4x4 vehicles? Why are 6x6 not more common?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/1bonp87/do_6x6_vehicles_have_better_survivability_than/)\n\nThe question asked, full quote, by /u/Big_koi:\n> I was wondering about the existence of 6x6 wheeled vehicles as I used to think they were a weird middle ground between 8x8 and 4x4 but I wondered if 6x6 vehicles have better survivability as I would assume there's more stability if a wheel is lost and thus you can drive better than compared to a 4x4 if damage is done. However 6x6 doesn't seem very common at so maybe they're not more stable but if not why bother with them at all?\n\n> Am I missing or misunderstanding the role of 6x6 vehicles compared to 8x8 and 4x4? I'd assume more wheels the better.\n\nThe common theme amongst the responses was that it seems to have the most to do with the weight of the vehicle. Adding more armor adds to the survivability, but adds more weight and thus requires more wheels to distribute the said weight. \nAdding more wheels adds complexity with regards to maintenance and difficulty steering the vehicle, so it all ends up being a tradeoff of the weight added, maneuverability lost and protection gained.\n\nSome partial quotes of the responses, though I really encourage you to read the whole thread:\n\nBy /u/blackhorse15A\n> It's really just down to the overall weight of the vehicle. Thicker hull with more armor= more weight= likely more wheels. Yes, there is a range of tire pressure and sizes, so there is some overlap where you could design for 4 or 6 (for example). But essentially, each tire supports a certain amount of weight and weight drives the requirement for wheels.\n\nBy /u/Otherwise_Cod_3478\n> The number of wheels depend on weight of the vehicle. The heavier the vehicle is, the more wheels you need to distribute this weight to lower the ground pressure. If you put too much weight and/or not enough wheels, you end up with more ground pressure and an higher risk of getting stuck in bad terrain. It's actually better to have the less wheels, as it make it easier for the vehicle to turn.

Tank road wheels don't really give any tracking and their ground pressure are abysmal. You basically have slim metal disk that will dig into the ground. Let's say you lose one of the 4 track. You will be able to move maybe a couple of feet before the vehicle get out of the track and then that side will just sink on the ground.\n\nThen you have the fact that if you lose one of your track, a quarter of your moving power is  gone. Without the drive sprocket dragging the track you can't use the power of your engine for that size.\n\nAFV design is already so much about balance. You simply can't afford to have enough ground pressure and power to do much when you lose a quarter of it. So either you need drastic overdesign for your ground pressure and power. This mean you need to design your AFV to be lighter and have more power than needed, which will come a the price of other aspect of the AFV. All of that to allow the AFV to kind of move in case of a partial mobility kill. That's sacrificing a lot of capability for a specific situation. It's rare that an AFV will be mobility kill only because of a track. Usually the damage is more severe than that. Like a mine might blow out a couple of road wheels, damage the drive sprocket or the suspension, stuff like that.\n\nFinally, you have the added complexity. You need a drive sprocket per track, right now that mean two drive sprocket on either side. They are on the back right next to the power pack, which make it easy to transfer the energy from engine to transmission to drive sprocket. But with quad tracks, you will need a way to split and transfer some power to the front of your tank to activate two more drive sprocket. That add non only complexity, but probably add a decent amount of height on your tank. That big drive shaft will need space.",

I'm reminded of the anti-Houthi alliance in Yemen, which especially early on basically had the open participation of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) alongside tribal militias, pro-Saudi elements of the Yemeni military, Muslim Brotherhood armed factions, etc. This got especially murky because the US, even while backing the anti-Houthi alliance and the Saudi-Emirati intervention, was also still carrying out sporadic bombings and spec ops raids against AQAP. Which in some cases, really pissed off local allies, because the US would end up killing key tribal leaders. [This story from *Reuters* from February 2017](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-trump-idUSKBN15M1HP/) is a perfect example of this: \n\n>Pro-government forces backed by Saudi Arabia are fighting Houthi loyalists in battlefronts stretching throughout Yemen and across its knotted array of armed tribal and militant groups. It was into this explosive environment that U.S. Navy SEALs rappelled on a moonless night on Jan. 29, engaging in a firefight that killed several suspected al Qaeda militants in a southern village. By daylight, one of the commandos had been killed and local medics said women and children were among some 30 dead Yemenis, allegations the United States said it was investigating. Though al Qaeda claimed one of the dead, Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, as one of their \"martyrs\", some officials on the government side denied that and said he was an important partner with local tribes in battles against the Houthis.",

So, 33 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Still incredibly high number, which Ukraine cannot pay by themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently Germany tries something like the Czech artillery shell initiative:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/news/germanys_initiative_seeking_patriot_systems_worldwide_for_ukraine_locations_numbers_and_potential_challenges-10079.html\">https://en.defence-ua.com/news/germanys_initiative_seeking_patriot_systems_worldwide_for_ukraine_locations_numbers_and_potential_challenges-10079.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Germany will seek ways to strengthen Ukraine&#39;s air defense with Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems and other systems. This was announced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGermany, as the chairman of the Air Defense Coalition, is initiating an immediate analysis of all Patriot batteries and other air defense systems available not only among the allies but also in the world, and what can be done, what combinations can be built to deliver these batteries to Ukraine,\u201d Kuleba said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Options are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Germany: approximately 10 Patriot PAC-3 batteries;</li>\n<li>The Netherlands: less than 3 Patriot PAC-3 batteries;</li>\n<li>Sweden: in the process of receiving up to 4, currently up to 2 Patriot PAC-3 batteries;</li>\n<li>Romania: in the process of receiving up to 7, currently up to 4 Patriot PAC-3 batteries;</li>\n<li>Poland: 2 Patriot batteries, plans for up to 12 PAC-3 batteries;</li>\n<li>Greece: 6 Patriot PAC-2 batteries;</li>\n<li>Spain: 3 Patriot PAC-2 batteries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But considering that the discussion also involved searching for Patriots outside the EU and NATO, the &quot;geography&quot; should be expanded to include Asia:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Japan: 24 Patriot PAC-3 batteries;</li>\n<li>South Korea: 8 Patriot PAC-3 batteries;</li>\n<li>Taiwan: 7 Patriot PAC-3 batteries.\nBut it is unlikely that among these countries it will be possible to find a donor for these SAM systems. Moreover, they do not supply weapons to Ukraine directly, and Japan is just beginning to lift its restrictions on arms exports.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to assume Ukraine will only ever receive a couple more at most. No country is willing to let them go.</p>\n</div>",

The defeat of China now spells the defeat of Russia, and Moscow knows that.\n\nEnds up? Russia has been aligned with China against the west for well over a decade, over hostilities with the west they initiated of their own volition.\n\n> China gets full Russian energy, resources, military technology support. Gone are the days when blockading the Straits of Malacca could have choked off China's energy imports.\n\nThe straights of Malacca are important to more than just energy imports. Even if Russia could supply enough energy, and the pipeline could stay in operation, the straights are required for Chinese goods to reach customers, as well as food imports.\n\n>The Russian army will come out of this war a much more dangerous opponent than it was in 2022. With triple the 2022 manpower, combat experience, massive growth of armaments industry.\n\nRussia has let its air defenses fall far so far behind the cutting edge of the threats they need to counter, I doubt that\u2019s the case.
