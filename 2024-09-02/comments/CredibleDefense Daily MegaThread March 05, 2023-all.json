This is a recurring theme.\n\nThe Russians took Severodonetsk after the Ukrainians did everything they could to stop it. Because of the Ukraine over focus on Severodonetsk versus other more important sectors, the Russians were able to take the entire eastern half of the salient, Lysychansk and the rest of Luhansk all fell. The assault on Severodonetsk didn't cost the Russians any other city or area, the other sectors they were trying and failing to take were due to the inability to assault rivers and other water obstacles (protecting UAF lines from Sloviansk to Siversk).\n\n>It's transparently obvious Russia would be better off just accepting the gains they've taken so far and fortifying and yet they still relentlessly attack into prepared Ukrainian positions.\n\nIts not obvious. First, they have a stated strategic goal to control the entirety of the Donbas. Second, attacking allows them to maintain the initiative. Third, it can be argued rather easily that allowing Ukraine a 4-6 month strategic break to build up forces and especially supplies to launch a strategic spring summer offensive is a bad idea, when by going on the offensive they prohibit the Ukraine ability to reconstitute, husband a large strategic reserve, and stockpile months and months worth of ammunition.\n\n>Look at what happened at Vuhledar there was no discernable strategic reason for that attack at this stage of the war.\n\nYou're using strategic incorrectly. There were tactical and operational reasons for the Russians to try to take Vulhedar, namely because they want to push the Ukrainians away from artillery range to their east-west supply lines that run through that sector. The strategic reason is to maintain hold of the Land Bridge. Unless the Russians are willing to compromise their supply line, they have to take it. Which is why the Ukrainians are defending it so heavily, they know the Russians need it. Not enough to become the strategic main effort, thus gaining the resources that would make success assured, but still important enough to continuously try to attack it. \n\nThe problem is that Vulhedar is a really tough nut to crack. It's got a 1-2 km open field south, east, and west of it that the Russians need to cross before they can even contemplate an assault. The Ukrainians have the high ground, they're HEAVILY fortified spending over half a year digging in, its HEAVILY mined, they know the exact routes the Russians can approach from, and they have artillery deployed scatterable mines to constantly replenish the minefield.",

The Brusilov offensive obliterated the Austro-Hungarian ability to self-sufficiently hold the front, and forced Germany to redeploy troops away from the Western Front during the simultaneous offensive happening at Verdun.</p>\n\n<p>You can even see techniques pioneered in the Brusilov offensive which are still relevant in the current war - that is, infiltration techniques. But the main point is that Russia suffering tremendous losses doesn&#39;t matter if their adversaries are put even further out of commission, and history asserts this. I think the pivotal point is to what extent Ukrainian units have been degraded by the Bakhmut &quot;meat grinder&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

Funny enough, casualties in this war among the Ukrainians aren't even that heavy and Ukraine hasn't really been fighting for its survival since last March, now they're just wanting to hold more territory and liberate what was lost.\n\nHistorically, the Czarist Russians and then Soviet Armed Forces did use cannon fodder on the regular.

The data suggest that the real impact in some areas is so far falling short of what officials might have hoped for.  \n\n>\u201cJust signing up to new sanctions is not enough,\u201d said Daniel Tannebaum, global anti-financial crime practice leader at consulting firm Oliver Wyman. \u201cGovernments now need enforcement mechanisms.\u201d\n\n>Shipments from China to Russia have also surged as Beijing plays an increasingly important role in supplying Moscow, the diplomat added, asking not to be named discussing sensitive information. Those countries outside the EU haven\u2019t sanctioned Russia themselves, but most have repeatedly denied they are helping the Kremlin.\n\n>The EU has sanctioned nearly 1,500 individuals, restricted exports on hundreds of goods and technologies, and targeted many of Moscow\u2019s key revenue sources. But some officials worry that the bloc still lacks an effective apparatus to enforce those measures and lags behind the US. \n\n>With a longer history of sanctioning foreign powers, the US has a centralized agency, more efficient procedures for gathering information as well as stringent legislation and the tools to enforce the rules at home and abroad.\n\n>In the EU, enforcement is a patchwork effort that mostly falls to member states.\n\n>While the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, monitors implementation and provides guidance, national authorities are responsible for identifying breaches and imposing penalties. And that means the results are inconsistent. \n\n>Ultimately, it\u2019s about political will, said one EU official involved in the process, and national officials can come under pressure when it comes to taking tough action against their own companies.\n\n>\u201cOur sanctions are biting hard and contributing to sustained economic recession in Russia,\u201d Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said in Bulgaria last week. \u201cBut their effectiveness also depends on how well they are enforced.\u201d\n\n>On the surface of things, sanctions appear to be effective. Russia\u2019s economy has contracted and many of its banks and companies remain cut off from international financial and trading systems. There is also evidence that the restrictions on European and US technologies have weakened key Russian industries and hampered their ability to innovate in the future.\n\n>But information collected by the Geneva-based Trade Data Monitor indicates that some sanctioned goods \u2014 particularly advanced semiconductors \u2014 are being diverted to Russia via third countries, many of which abruptly changed their trading habits following Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n>In some cases, the exports to Russia of technologies that could be used for military purposes in Ukraine have gone from effectively zero to millions of dollars.\n\n>Kazakhstan provides a key example. In 2022 the Central Asian nation exported $3.7 million worth of advanced semiconductors to Russia, up from a mere $12,000 worth the year before the war started. \n\n>Russia was buying an average of $163 million worth of advanced chips and integrated circuits from the EU, the US, Japan and the UK each year between 2017 and 2021. In 2022, that slumped to about $60 million.\n\n>The data show Turkey, Serbia, the UAE and a half-dozen other economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia helped make up the shortfall. Meanwhile, shipments of high-tech components to those countries from the allied nations surged by a similar amount.\n\n>The same sort of patterns are apparent across hundreds of product categories, but it is especially acute when it comes to advanced chips and integrated circuits that can be used for military purposes, the diplomat said.  \n\n>With Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine now into its second year, the EU and its allies are increasingly focused on tightening any loopholes and preventing successive rounds of sanctions they\u2019ve introduced from being circumvented.\n\n>But tracking shipments isn\u2019t a straightforward process. Buyers sometimes use complex corporate vehicles and distribution models to obscure the final destination of their goods. Incomplete paperwork can add to the opacity, as well as so-called transshipment points, where goods are moved between vehicles or rerouted. \n\n>On Thursday, the Biden administration released a compliance note aimed at cracking down on intermediaries used to evade sanctions and export controls on Russia. The notice names China, Armenia, Turkey and Uzbekistan as locations that may be used to illegally redirect restricted items to Russia.\n\n>The G-7 announced last week a new mechanism to bolster enforcement and the EU has also introduced several tools in its recent packages to go after those aiding Russia.\n\n>But EU countries have so far been shy about using some of those tools and going after potential breaches at home, at least publicly. Discussions on toughening up the EU\u2019s enforcement regime has opened a debate over where the share of responsibilities between Brussels and Europe\u2019s capitals should lie when it comes to policing measures, officials and diplomats say.\n\n>Patchwork of Enforcement\n\n>\u201cIt would of course be more convenient for everybody if there was one EU level institution in charge,\u201d Toms Platacis, the acting director of the Latvian Financial Intelligence Unit, said in an interview. \n\n>Latvia has criminalized sanctions violations, while other EU countries have not, so violators can \u201clook for other countries where evading sanctions carries less potential penalty,\u201d he said.\n\n>In implementing successive rounds of sanctions, EU nations have been careful to limit the impact on their own bottom line and the wider global economy. That has at times led to often tortuous discussions between member states over exemptions and reporting requirements. \n\n>With every round of sanctions we take a step forward with new measures and one step back with new exemptions, one senior European minister said. Some member states are less enthusiastic about enforcement and are not doing enough, the minister added.\n\n>\u201cEnforcement of export sanctions is not trivial,\u201d said Beata Javorcik, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \u201cEvery government wants all other countries to enforce them but prefers to be lenient vis-a-vis its own firms. The experience with export restrictions during the Cold War shows this clearly. Thus, leaving enforcement of sanctions to national governments may not always work perfectly.\u201d\n\nThere have been some indications (along with some actions) recently from both von der Leyen and Blinken that they plan on getting increasingly serious about this issue, but placing more and more new sanctions to score brownie points in a wolf and pony show isn\u2019t it.",

Sure, the longer sanctions go on and the longer the war goes on, which would require Russia to rebuild its own capabilities, will have no impact on exports. If you want to take a good hard look at Russia\u2019s dwindling soft power, look no further than its closest sphere of influence and what\u2019s going on in Serbia and the CSTO. Vucic\u2019s comments over the past couple weeks alone would have been utterly unimaginable a year ago.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I was thinking about how the story of WW2 is told most often through the lens of the airborne in Europe and the marines in the pacific. \n\nOstensibly the latter was in part because the marines had a perceived need to 'justify their existence' at a time when a lot of people were apparently asking 'why do we need a marine corps'. And in both instances i guess the narrative was an easier sell due to the fragmented nature of their involvement which allowed the war to be boiled down to a handful of 'key engagements' (D-day, market garden, etc). Essentially... think Band of Brothers. In reality it was the 'grunts' in the army doing the vast majority of the fighting across all the theatres and taking all the losses in some horrific yet important and often largely ignored engagements (or even within the exact same engagements)\n\nThere's clearly something similar happening with Wagner in particular in Ukraine in the sense that they provide an interesting and distinct lens through which to view the war.

Intel is about 1.5 generations behind, and may or may not be catching up (more data points needed) \u2014 the big issue for Intel is that they're only now starting the process of opening up to third parties. The point here being that it's not *only* TSMC that does anything advanced. In a realistic sense a country with access to Samsung and/or Intel is a country that can get advanced enough fabrication for a modern economy.\n\nA modern fab is in the range of $20b. Part of the reason they're so expensive is because of the expensive equipment. The only company making EUV lithography equipment (needed for nodes that are 5nm class and below) is ASML, a Dutch company with significant US offices. The other major lithography equipment makers are Nikon and Canon, both Japanese. Just owning an advanced fab is pointless if there's no capability to get equipment for it or repair/replace the equipment in it.\n\nFabs are also very sensitive locations. Part of their construction process is putting the entire facility on a foundation that protects against vibrations from even things as mundane as traffic. Even without explicit efforts to sabotage fabs in Taiwan during a successful takeover, there's a very, very, very big chance that they'd be rendered inoperable as a byproduct of the fighting. With China really having no ability to get them back online. Realistically, there would be efforts to destroy the fabs if a successful takeover was on the table: the US at the minimum would, I expect, be willing to do a flyby with some B2s to destroy each one.\n\nThe point in those two paragraphs being that China cannot expect to *gain* advanced fabs out of invading Taiwan. The most they can hope to do is deny those fabs to everyone... But that just shifts the industry to be exclusively in South Korea and the US. Which is an eventuality that the US is preparing for right now and making major investments around. Before China is materially capable of such an invasion, the US will have shifted enough semiconductor fabrication to the US to weather the economic fallout of Taiwan's fabs going dark. Not enough to remove all negatives from that potentiality, but to make it eminently survivable. Both economically and militarily.\n\nIn the mean time, Taiwan's importance here also just means the US is more willing to put up a fight in their defense. Would the US go to war to protect assets that enable 5% of its GDP? What about 20%? That makes it a harder calculus for China, not easier.\n\nI'd like to circle back to China acquiring fabs. They are limited right now by the ability to build the facilities. It's equipping the facilities (US, Japan, and the Netherlands own that market). It's running the software for those facilities (US owns that market). It's the raw inputs to those facilities (US, Japan).\n\nIn summary, we have:\n\n- China cannot gain fabs from invasion.\n- If China somehow does gain fabs from an invasion, they cannot replicate or maintain long term those fabs due to equipment issues.\n- The rest of the world has alternatives. Worse alternatives but close enough.\n- The importance of said fabs adds a major economic element to US incentives to defend Taiwan.\n\nThe US sanctions on China, if they increase the chance of hostilities, would only be through directly increasing the acrimony of the US-China relationship, rather than by making China \"need\" Taiwan more \u2014 Taiwan's industry is useless in the sense of hostile takeover.",

Realistically, there would be efforts to destroy the fabs if a successful takeover was on the table: the US at the minimum would, I expect, be willing to do a flyby with some B2s to destroy each one.</p>\n\n<p>The point in those two paragraphs being that China cannot expect to <em>gain</em> advanced fabs out of invading Taiwan. The most they can hope to do is deny those fabs to everyone... But that just shifts the industry to be exclusively in South Korea and the US. Which is an eventuality that the US is preparing for right now and making major investments around. Before China is materially capable of such an invasion, the US will have shifted enough semiconductor fabrication to the US to weather the economic fallout of Taiwan&#39;s fabs going dark. Not enough to remove all negatives from that potentiality, but to make it eminently survivable. Both economically and militarily.</p>\n\n<p>In the mean time, Taiwan&#39;s importance here also just means the US is more willing to put up a fight in their defense. Would the US go to war to protect assets that enable 5% of its GDP? What about 20%? That makes it a harder calculus for China, not easier.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to circle back to China acquiring fabs. They are limited right now by the ability to build the facilities. It&#39;s equipping the facilities (US, Japan, and the Netherlands own that market). It&#39;s running the software for those facilities (US owns that market). It&#39;s the raw inputs to those facilities (US, Japan).</p>\n\n<p>In summary, we have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>China cannot gain fabs from invasion.</li>\n<li>If China somehow does gain fabs from an invasion, they cannot replicate or maintain long term those fabs due to equipment issues.</li>\n<li>The rest of the world has alternatives. Worse alternatives but close enough.</li>\n<li>The importance of said fabs adds a major economic element to US incentives to defend Taiwan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The US sanctions on China, if they increase the chance of hostilities, would only be through directly increasing the acrimony of the US-China relationship, rather than by making China &quot;need&quot; Taiwan more \u2014 Taiwan&#39;s industry is useless in the sense of hostile takeover.</p>\n</div>",
