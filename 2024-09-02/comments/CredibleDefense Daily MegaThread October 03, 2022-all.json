When I say relatively credible, I don't mean going to happen, but if we're entertaining the idea of nuclear weapons use we should be entertaining asymmetrical escalation moves like this as well. It's just as credible imo. This would obviously be a disastrous and dangerous move from Russia, but after all it does not break the nuclear taboo. Really quite a curious proposal and something I find really fascinating. I know there are treaties against the militarization of space, but if Russia decides to destroy its own satellite or send a \"faulty\" satellite into orbit knowing it'll blow, well, that's going to be quite difficult to respond to.",

And in typical Putin fashion he will wait past the optimal point to do so thereby dragging himself down with him. The mobilisation is the last card and if it's not working by the end of winter and he is forced to call more waves of mobilisation I don't think Putin will last very long. He will appoint (too late) another defence minister, but by that point the frustration and anger will be boiled over. Then someone like Prigozhin will make their move and Putin will be out.

Some positive changes will be made but the issues are far more systemic and after 6-12 months they too will be given the boot. \n\nAt this point we might have someone else have a go or people will have worked out that it's a poison pill and they will bring it some moderates to take over and sue for peace (and pin the shame of defeat on), propably counting on overthrowing them after a few years when things cool down.

In fact on Wednesday the administration announced funding for 18 more HIMARS for Ukraine, bringing the total to over 30 US systems.\n\n>There are also concerns inside the administration that providing the longer-range ATACMS weapons would cross a red line in the eyes of Moscow, which would see the US becoming \u201ca direct party to the conflict.\u201d\n\n>But that red line is becoming murkier with Friday\u2019s annexation of four Ukraine territories by Russia. The US has stated that it will support the use of western weapons inside those zones even if Russia now considers it part of its official territory.\n\n>Still, the idea of taking a more active role in discussions over Ukrainian targeting raises American fears of being seen as more involved than it would like.\n\n>**Striking deeper into Crimea**\n\n>Ukrainian officials have kept the longer-range ATACMS at the top of their wish list, saying they are ready to be as \u201copen as needed\u201d to assuage American concerns and have already listed for the US precisely what they intend to go after.\n\n>\u201cWe essentially described exactly what specific targets we need to hit on our territory which are not reachable with what we have now,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian official. \u201cThe categories of targets are clear and do not change.\u201d\n\n>Among them would be more distant Russian logistical lines, air defense and bases, as well as ammunition depots in Ukraine\u2019s east and south, including Crimea, which have become a regular target of the current US-provided rocket systems whose munitions have a maximum range of around 50 miles (80 kilometers).\n\n>The new rockets would also allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Crimea to target the launching points of Russia\u2019s Iranian drones, something it cannot currently do, according to an American source familiar with the country\u2019s requests.\n\n>In pressing the Americans for the longer-range rockets, Ukrainian officials have also **dismissed concerns that they would strike Russian territory, arguing they have not done so with the HIMARS systems despite having the range to in some cases.**\n\n>\u201cWe gave assurances that we will not do it [with the HIMARS] and we did not,\u201d the Ukrainian official said. \u201cI think the problem is for the US to get over the psychological threshold and approve the [ATACMS] capability.\u201d\n\n>While the Biden administration has not ruled out sending the ATACAMS eventually, for now they are **\u201clow reward and high risk,\u201d** according to an official familiar with the discussions.\n\n>**Winning with what it has**\n\n>After much lobbying and discussion, Ukraine has made effective use of the HIMARS systems it began receiving in May, particularly in its recent counteroffensive in the east.\n\n>US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made specific mention of the HIMARS systems in discussing Ukraine\u2019s recent battlefield success in the Kherson region of the country during an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday on \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201d\n\n>Austin said Ukrainian forces have used \u201ctechnology like HIMARS\u201d and **employed it in the \u201cright way\u201d to \u201cconduct attacks on things like logistical stores and command and control, that\u2019s taking away \u2013 taken away significant capability from the Russians.\u201d**\n\n>US officials have argued the current precision HIMARS munitions, called GMLRS, offer plenty of firepower and range for Ukraine\u2019s current needs with the ability to strike the vast majority of Russian targets.\n\n>\u201cWe believe that we\u2019re providing the Ukrainians with the range of capabilities that are commensurate with the fight that they\u2019re executing based on the requirements that they\u2019ve identified for us,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker said Friday. \u201cWe really believe that the most critical requirements for Ukraine right now is the GMLRS munition that can reach most of the targets that they have identified within Ukrainian territory,\u201d said Baker.\n\n>**Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukrainian land and Putin\u2019s nuclear saber-rattling has done little to deter western support for Ukraine\u2019s attacks against them to re-claim territory and many officials point to Ukraine\u2019s repeated strikes in Crimea \u2013 taken by Russia in 2014 \u2013 as evidence that Russia\u2019s threats are bluster.**\n\n>\u201cUkraine has the absolute right to defend itself throughout its territory, including to take back the territory that has been illegally seized in one way or another by Russia,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday in response to a question from CNN.\n\n>\u201cBecause there is no change at all in the territory that is being annexed by the Russians as a matter for us or for the Ukrainians, the **Ukrainians will continue to do what they need to do to get back the land that has been taken from them.

We are being spoon fed videos of middle aged fat drunk russians with rusty rifles and missing uniform etc, and im sure they are real and very common. But in the bigger picture most of the drafted men are young russian men under 25 that did 12 months or more in the Army not more than 5 years ago. It's unknown to what level the mobilized troops can be equipped, but i think we're fooling our selfs if we think that russia wont be able to round up enough equipment to fit these guys out in due time. Sure, much of it will probably be end of the cold-war era stuff, but thats what the other side uses too to a large extent. Last estimate i read from Ukraine intelligence in june was that russia probably can mobilize from storage 600 tanks with minimal repairs, 2000 more tanks in the longer term and ca 6000 APC/IFV's, thats not including new production, and the longer the war drags on the larger all of those numbers will be.\n\nOn the Ukrainian side things are unclear to. There is a limited number of tanks and APC/IFV's and they are irreplaceable as long as the west refuse to supply western hardware of that sort. There are very little old Soviet hardware left in Europe to give to Ukraine. \n\nThe ongoing Ukrainian offensives in east and west are in reality fairly small - about 7 Ukr brigades in each front, or about 30 000 men where far from all of them have combat roles of any sort. Kherson is a lost cause for the russians, no doubt. But in Luhansk it does not take an unrealistic high number of russians to halt the Ukrainian advance. And i personally feel that if the russians manages to halt the Ukrainian offensive in Luhansk, the whole conflict will turn back into a numbers game where russia arguably have an advantage, or at least enough resources left to prolong this conflict a long time.\n\nIt's also necessary to mention that russia still have steps of escalation left.

What, exactly, is victory? Is it building a European style Democratic nation? If so we failed at that, and it\u2019s not my sense we even tried all that hard. Americans were more than willing to turn a blind eye towards Kabul\u2019s corruption for decades. What about a corrupt, undemocratic, but pro-US government? We did do a better job there, probably had we kept a residual force in Kabul we could have maintained that government for years. The rest of the country might have been a bigger challenge, but then you\u2019d have to ask \u2018why\u2019 would a pro-US government there be worthwhile? Maybe to keep out foreign powers like Russia and China. We\u2019ve done an okay job with that, tho again withdraw probably undermined 20 years of good work keeping China out of Afghanistan. But that\u2019s not very satisfying for the guys that fought there and the nation that paid for it. \u2018We did all that so China wouldn\u2019t build roads and mines in Afghanistan\u2019 isn\u2019t a good way to win re-election. What about destroying the Taliban? We did that in days. Certainly could do it again, if we wanted. But to what end? And assuming that the Taliban is something you can just destroy, like a country, misunderstands what the organization is. This also doesn\u2019t end up with a stable, democratic Afghanistan which is why the initial invasion went nowhere in the first place. What about making the country a safe haven for terrorists, one of the initial bush admin war aims? I think actually the US did pretty well there. The war made a lot of terrorists, but then they fought and died there as well. If you\u2019re concerned that Afghanistan could have been a base for more 9/11s, I think the invasion ended that possibility. But again, is \u2018kill them there so they don\u2019t kill us here\u2019 something that would win you reelection?\n\nUltimately the Afghan war was lost, IMO, because the US had no clear articulable strategic goals. Strategy, as Clausewitz defines it, is the correlation between means, ends, and national objective. I have all these soldiers, they can blow all this shit up. Strategy tells you what to blow up to produce the new world you want to live in. But in Afghanistan, we never have a clear national objective and thus no strategy. And certainly nothing most Americans would have wanted to hear. So the US moved forward with a zombie war, nobody wanted to leave (for vague notions) but nobody could see a way forward. If Trump hadn\u2019t pulled the plug, we\u2019d probably still have 10k SOF there making sure Kabul stayed pro-US with the country in a state of equilibrium, territory controlled by the Taliban but people controlled by a corrupt but pro-American regime. It would have been chaos, but maybe chaos worked for the US (say, again, if your goal was to keep China and Russia, and Al Qaeda out).",

Not that the Russians won't try an offensive, but I'm inclined to believe the Russians have equipment and doctrinal issues they need to overcome before they can be effective in the attack. I'm also inclined to believe (I may be wrong) that we're going to see a phase where Putin will hamstring the Russian military's options by restricting the area of ground operations to the four oblasts Russia now considers Russia. That will allow Ukraine to focus their forces and we'll see more pointless headbutting by the Russians against Ukrainian strongpoints.\n\n6 to 12 months: With winter come and gone and NATO/EU continuing to back Ukraine, Putin will finally realize high gas prices in the EU aren't going to win this war and he needs a military victory.  The Russian forces involved at this point are still not sufficient for the capture of major cities so there will be another round of mobilization and Putin will okay ground operations beyond the \"Russian\" oblasts. However, none of the Russian equipment and doctrinal issues will have been addressed because band-aids will do if you always think the war is going to end next month.

Between new Russian forces, mud season, and the friction of losses taken while attacking, the current Ukrainian offensives will fizzle out.</p>\n\n<p>3 to 6 months: We&#39;ll see a form of stalemate over the winter.  Not that the Russians won&#39;t try an offensive, but I&#39;m inclined to believe the Russians have equipment and doctrinal issues they need to overcome before they can be effective in the attack. I&#39;m also inclined to believe (I may be wrong) that we&#39;re going to see a phase where Putin will hamstring the Russian military&#39;s options by restricting the area of ground operations to the four oblasts Russia now considers Russia. That will allow Ukraine to focus their forces and we&#39;ll see more pointless headbutting by the Russians against Ukrainian strongpoints.</p>\n\n<p>6 to 12 months: With winter come and gone and NATO/EU continuing to back Ukraine, Putin will finally realize high gas prices in the EU aren&#39;t going to win this war and he needs a military victory.  The Russian forces involved at this point are still not sufficient for the capture of major cities so there will be another round of mobilization and Putin will okay ground operations beyond the &quot;Russian&quot; oblasts. However, none of the Russian equipment and doctrinal issues will have been addressed because band-aids will do if you always think the war is going to end next month. Therefore the Russians won&#39;t get anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>36 months+: The Russians eventually win.</p>\n</div>",

Some, but not all of them, had some form of ballistic armor, a couple of armored anti-riot vehicles, and \u201ca few\u201d Soviet-era RPG-7 rocket launchers.</p>\n\n<p>Facing a proper Russian army armored column, the Mykolaiv police were grossly outmatched. However, they were all veteran street cops, so as a group they knew every side road, ditch and building in the area. Also, to their advantage, the Russians seemed not to be expecting resistance.</p>\n\n<p>The first ambushes made the Russians more careful. Meanwhile the police, using anti-armor rockets dropped by the Russian soldiers, knocked out or burned the RF tanks and BTR infantry assault vehicles. Danila said dozens of RF special forces troopers died in the fighting. A few escaped but there were no prisoners. Mykolaiv held.        </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the Russians were pushed back, they reverted back to police duties but still contribute to the war effort:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mykolaiv Patrol Police checkpoints respond to missile and artillery strikes, escort road convoys moving military equipment, and sometimes execute door-knock raids on residences and commercial structures suspected of containing RF collaborators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/russias-war/ukraines-defenders-14-mykolaiv-patrol-police-commander-vitaly-danila.html\">https://www.kyivpost.com/russias-war/ukraines-defenders-14-mykolaiv-patrol-police-commander-vitaly-danila.html</a></p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Wall of text incoming.\n\nOryx has updated its summary of past and planned deliveries of military equipment by France to Ukraine:\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/07/arms-for-ukraine-french-weapon.html\n\u00a0\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to try and make my own summary of what France could realistically deliver to Ukraine in the future:\n\u00a0\n\n-Tanks: There's recently been some debate in France about donating\u00a0Leclerc MBTs\u00a0to Ukraine. But I don't think this idea will get through. As some others have already explained here, like with Abrams, the delivery of Leclercs would bring a number of problems for Ukraine (logistics, training,...). Some people also argue that Leclercs would not be suitable for the missions the Ukrainians would give them. I won't give an opinion on this last argument as I personally have little idea what Ukrainian tank doctrine is.\n\u00a0\n\n-IFV: The\u00a0AMX-10 RC\u00a0is an armoured fighting vehicle manufactured by GIAT for armoured reconnaissance purposes. It has been equipping French cavalry units since 1981. Over 240 were still in service with the French Army as of 2021, but they are gradually being replaced in French service by the EBRC Jaguar since then.\u00a0 Theoretically, AMX-10 RC could become a good candidate for future French deliveries to Ukraine. France doesn\u2019t need these vehicles anymore, and even if it keeps most of them in reserve, it could still send dozens to the Ukrainian army. These \"wheeled tank destroyer\" or \"light tank\", as they are often called, could be useful for Ukraine. The ability of AMX-10 RC to overcome difficult terrain is exceptionally good, thanks to its 12 drive wheels. The main gun, while being smaller compared to tanks, is still enough to easily destroy BMP or APC class vehicles from the Russian Army. In fact, the equipped 105 mm rifled gun can fire four types of different ammunition, including armor-piercing, high explosive, and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles. That being said, the AMX-10 RC armor is much lighter and can be penetrated with light autocannons using armor-piercing ammunition. The wheels lack stability compared to a track-based chassis, and the 105-mm gun is not stabilized. In addition to that, it uses 105mm\u00d7527R proprietary ammunition which is not compatible with the NATO 105-mm projectile standard.\n\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0Panhard ER, named \"Sagaie\", is also being replaced by the ERBC Jaguar. In service since 1984, around 400 were produced.\u00a0 It is a six-wheeled armoured car which is highly mobile and amphibious with an option of being NBC-proof It is fitted with a 90mm cannon. It was developed as a reconnaissance vehicle and therefore has a high mobility, whether on land or in the water. It has a range of 750km and considerable firepower thanks to its cannon, but is lightly armored. The Sagaies have been used extensively in Africa, in vastly different environments (deserts, forests,...).\n\u00a0\n\n-APC: The\u00a0VAB\u00a0is yet another vehicle that is currently being replaced in the French army (by the VBMR Griffon). I'm sure a lot of people here have already heard about it, as at least a few dozen have already been delivered to Ukraine. But thousands of VABs have been produced since the 70s, and I'm sure France has the capacity to deliver many more (potentially hundreds). It would be a good thing imo. VABs are lightly armored but polyvalent, and their use by Ukraine in the Kherson offensive has proved their usefulness.\n\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0Panhard V\u00e9hicule Blind\u00e9 L\u00e9ger\u00a0(\"Light armoured vehicle\"), also known by its acronym\u00a0Panhard VBL\u00a0or simply\u00a0VBL\u00a0could also be a good candidate for delivery to the Ukrainian army. It was designed to combine the agility of the Peugeot P4 liaison vehicle (some of which have already been delivered by France to Ukraine) with adequate protection against small arms fire, artillery fragments, mines and NBC weapons. Produced between 1985 and 2010, the vehicle has been used by the French army and other European, African and Central American armies in various conflicts since the 1980s.\n\u00a0\n\n-Artillery: Contemporary of the\u00a0TRF1 towed howitzers, which France has announced the upcoming delivery to Ukraine, was the\u00a0AMX AuF1 SPG. The French army still had 80 of them in 2013, and the last ones were removed from active duty in 2019 and should be kept in reserve until 2030. Based on the AMX-30 MBT chassis, the AUF1 has an effective range of 23km firing conventional rounds and 28km using Rocket Assisted Projectiles (RAPs). It\u2019s main advantage is that it incorporates full armor and NBC protection for its crew of four. It proved useful against the Serbs in Bosnia.\n\u00a0\n\nFrance also has the\u00a0MO-120 RT\u00a0towed heavy mortar. Exported to more than 24 foreign countries or, in some cases, produced under licence it is issued to artillery units, where it complements artillery guns and systems, although infantry units operate it in some countries. The MO-120 RT uses standard NATO rounds with a range of 8,2\u00a0km and the PRPA (RAP-Rocket Assisted Projectile) with a range of 13\u00a0km. Rounds fired from the mortar can reach as high as about 4,000 m and hit the ground with an effective kill radius of nearly 76\u00a0m. Unfortunately, only half of the 171 pieces the French army has are currently available for immediate use, so I doubt France would want to send significant amount to Ukraine.\n\u00a0\n\nWe must not forget that France has been and still is very secretive about what it sends to Ukraine, and there may be stuff we still haven't heard about.",

                            "body": "> Raiding them hurts US readiness \n\nI find such arguments completely unconvincing.\n\nThere may be arguments against providing M1's which I might agree with, from a direction of logistics burden on Ukraine, or from a direction of opportunity costs where something else is more urgent.\n\nBut from a direction of harming US readiness?  That's rather hard to swallow.  Because --\n\n1. The US Army says that it has more M1's than it wants to own. It's made to keep buying them, and there is valid rational for that to keep the lines open, the knowledge base intact, and the skilled labor employed. But the fact remains, the Army has more tanks than it wants, and those cost money and manpower even just sitting around.\n\n2. The M1's exist to fight Russia. Having some old ones do that improves US readiness by taking a major military foe off the table, more than tucking them away someplace would.\n\n3. There are no other major foes left that would need a significant number of tanks. A war with China would not use many, nor with NK. Who else then? Remember, the US Army itself does not believe it needs as many M1's as it is compelled to retain.\n\n4. If the US really, really believed it needed a big reserve fleet of M1s (again, for what?), it could immediately transfer some of the good ones to Ukraine, and later on, fix up some that were in disrepair to replenish the reserve.\n\nBut again remember, the Army wants fewer tanks, not more, so that it can spend the money it now spends maintaining all those M1's, on things it believes it needs more than those. If anything, giving some M1's to Ukraine would *improve* US readiness, not harm it.\n\n----\n\nEdit -- Since I am getting downvoted for posting something widely reported, here are references to back up my statements:\n\nCNN - [The U.S. has more than enough combat tanks in the field to meet the nation's defense needs ... the Army's chief of staff Gen.

If you only have crews for 1500, then giving up some of the ones you can't crew, to have them take a major geopolitical foe off the table, seems like more of a win than a loss. OK, maybe you can create hypotheticals such as \"Well, the US might lose some tanks but the crews survive, and then we could give the other operational tanks to those crews\".  But that's a thin argument, IMO, compared to the benefit of taking RU's army off the table.  The readiness *benefit* outweighs the readiness *cost*.  You can't just argue one side of a ledger with two sides. The question is not \"is the US better off with X or with X+Y tanks\", it's \"are we better off with X tanks *and* with the RU army no longer a threat?\"\n\n>  Russians seem to have had destroyed and then replaced more thanks than the US has operational.\n\nThis makes little sense to me. Ukraine destroyed those tanks *without* the overwhelming US air assets and *without* the US M1s which are much more capable than what RU is using, and *without* NATO countries fighting alongside. It did so with some older soviet tanks given by former-Soviet NATO members, with artillery, and with ATGMs.  Also some were lost to RU incompetence.  How would the US have any difficulty mauling Russia to a far greater degree and far faster?\n\nWe have evidence now which we did not have a year ago.  Russia did not have enough tanks to handle Ukraine plus the various donations.  Donations that notably did not include the USAF, a single M1, or the whole rest of NATO.\n\nAnyway, we are probably arguing over a rather fine point, since I am not advocating in favor of M1's to Ukraine.  I'm only saying I doubt that \"not enough tanks\" ranks very highly in the consideration of US military planners.  Logistics, sure, I buy that.  Insufficient tanks, I still doubt quite heavily.  We've given what, 1/4 to 1/3 of several other important assets?  That seems far more significant a readiness loss than 100 older Abrams would ever be, given a major foe taken off the table.

If you only have crews for 1500, then giving up some of the ones you can't crew, to have them take a major geopolitical foe off the table, seems like more of a win than a loss. OK, maybe you can create hypotheticals such as \"Well, the US might lose some tanks but the crews survive, and then we could give the other operational tanks to those crews\".  \n\nFirst off, the argument wouldn\u2019t be to give them to crews of just destroyed tanks, but also hopefully replacement crews that become trained. \n\nSecond, those extra tanks are in prepositioned brigade sets. They\u2019re entire ABCT\u2019s worth of equipment. There\u2019s one ABCT set watch in Europe, the Middleeast and Korea. Plus one afloat. \n\nThese sets are not modernized, and are only beginning to start that process. The idea though, is that instead of the significant amount of time required to move units from the US to these hotspots, you can simply fly the Soldiers there (even using commercial flights) and have them ready to go in days instead of weeks/months. \n\n>But that's a thin argument, IMO, compared to the benefit of taking RU's army off the table.  \n\nI disagree. \n\n>The readiness benefit outweighs the readiness cost.  \n\nI don\u2019t get it. There\u2019s only so many units and they\u2019re constantly rotating. Almost 1/3 of US armor is forward deployed, 1/3 is coming back and refitting and 1/3 is working up and moving to be forward deployed. You\u2019d have to decide to not have a US armored presence somewhere in the world for a significant amount of time. \n\n>You can't just argue one side of a ledger with two sides. The question is not \"is the US better off with X or with X+Y tanks\", it's \"are we better off with X tanks and with the RU army no longer a threat?\n\nI think I can. To give the Ukrainians functioning tanks, you\u2019d have to take them from army units that need them, or you won\u2019t be able to continue the rotation the\nUS follows. \n\n>This makes little sense to me. \n\nI don\u2019t see how it doesn\u2019t. The Russians started the war with about twice as many operational tanks than the US. They then lost about half of them and have been replacing them with tanks pulled from storage. \n\n>Ukraine destroyed those tanks without the overwhelming US air assets \n\nCorrect, they did it by facing Russians who didn\u2019t expect any serious opposition and using more AT assets than an American unit could ever hope to have. \n\n>and without the US M1s which are much more capable than what RU is using, \n\nThough I agree with this in principle, it\u2019s not as stark a difference as you may consider it. Virtually no tank is going to have a good time being hit by a javelin or any ATGM. All ranks ever are vulnerable to WWII AT weapons if you get a flank shot. \n\n>It did so with some older soviet tanks given by former-Soviet NATO members, with artillery, and with ATGMs.  \n\nI mean, yes? \n\n>Also some were lost to RU incompetence.  \n\nAnd very much this. It\u2019s abundantly apparent the Russians didn\u2019t take the invasion seriously and didn\u2019t plan on this turning into a war. \n\n>How would the US have any difficulty mauling Russia to a far greater degree and far faster?\n\nWell, the Russians would probably be planning for a fight. \n\nAs well, without a six month long build up, you could not move as significant amount of US armor to Europe. You be relying on at most 1-2 ABCT\u2019s, 1-2 SBCT\u2019s and perhaps 3 IBCT\u2019s for the first month. So 13-45 thousand actual US ground combatants. \n\nThe Ukrainians also have far more artillery than American units, and the Ukrainians are being outshot 1:5. So things aren\u2019t all roses for the US/NATO. \n\n>We have evidence now which we did not have a year ago.  Russia did not have enough tanks to handle Ukraine plus the various donations.  \n\nI mean, Russia didn\u2019t have enough of anything (especially intelligence) to completely fuck up an invasion thinking they were going to parade in. They didn\u2019t conduct a substantial bombing campaign and they had way too many axis of advance. \n\nThey went into some cities looking like they were actually on parade. Which is certainly not something they\u2019d do facing NATO. \n\n>Donations that notably did not include the USAF, a single M1, or the whole rest of NATO.\n\nFirst off, M1 isn\u2019t some super weapon, especially the models we\u2019d likely give them. \n\nSecond, the amount of aid given to Ukraine is insane. They give out advanced ATGM\u2019s like candy, something NATO units could never afford to do. \n\nThe reason that the US/NATO viewed the RGF\u2019s is it had previously demonstrated both in combat and in training that is could rapidly materialize a massive conventional force along its borders in very short time. This meant Russia could produce an enormous local material advantage that would take months for NATO to begin to match. The fear was the war would be over before the USAF could even get in the game. \n\nInstead the Russians sat on the Ukrainian border for months and then tried to parade in. \n\nRegardless, all aid could be cut off to Ukraine right now and the RGF\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be a legitimate threat to NATO for many years, if not decades.",

From the area around Arapivka, Volodymyrivka, and Kuzemivka, without any feints, without any diversions, with plentiful of air support and artillery support (that, however, was poorly directed) \u2014 straight over that empty area towards west.\n\n>Obviously, Ukrainians detected them early, brought their units in position, and brought in their artillery to bear.\n\n>Apparently, the first to go was the T-90s-equipped 27th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade. It attacked Kurylivka on 24 September, and lost a number of T-90s knocked out or abandoned in the process (even days later, Ukrainians were still collecting pieces of that unit around the battlefield). The next was a BTG of the 237th Tank Regiment, equipped with T-80s and BMP-2s taken out of storage. This attacked Petropavlivka and was completely smashed, sometimes on Sunday and/or Monday, 25\u201326 September. Think, somebody counted some 10\u201311 T-80s, a similar number of BMPs and MT-LBs, and about 40 other vehicles on just one video shown that battlefield on the \u2018next morning\u2019, but can\u2019t find that link any more. Considering a Motor Rifle BTG can be expected to have a company of 10\u201311 MBTs, two or three companies of IFVs (like BMPs), and then similar-sized artillery support: as said, more or less an entire BTG was smashed there.\n\n>And still, these \u20181,5 BTGs lost\u2019, were just a start.\n\n>On Tuesday, 27 September, the Russians went for Kurylivka again \u2014 with exactly the same result: lost another BTG. Then, think it was Thursday, they went for Kivsharivka \u2014 and promptly lost the next BTG. In these two clashes, Ukrainians actually let the Russians enter the villages, then attacked from several sides: the Russians run away \u2014 as far as they could: dozens were killed.\n\n>Perhaps some of battles in question lasted longer (the one for Kurylivka was something like a \u2018chain of major clashes, lasting several days\u2019), and, have no doubt: Ukrainians lost some, too. But, overall outcome of this show-down is clear: day after day, the 27th GMRB and the 3rd MRD were attacking, and attacking, and attacking, wave after wave \u2014 only to get smashed, literally, to pieces. They run into mines, they were hit by artillery, they were hit by Ukrainian ATGMs, then by tanks, and finally by infantry-operated light anti-tank weapons.",

Considering a Motor Rifle BTG can be expected to have a company of 10\u201311 MBTs, two or three companies of IFVs (like BMPs), and then similar-sized artillery support: as said, more or less an entire BTG was smashed there.</p>\n\n<p>And still, these \u20181,5 BTGs lost\u2019, were just a start.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, 27 September, the Russians went for Kurylivka again \u2014 with exactly the same result: lost another BTG. Then, think it was Thursday, they went for Kivsharivka \u2014 and promptly lost the next BTG. In these two clashes, Ukrainians actually let the Russians enter the villages, then attacked from several sides: the Russians run away \u2014 as far as they could: dozens were killed.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps some of battles in question lasted longer (the one for Kurylivka was something like a \u2018chain of major clashes, lasting several days\u2019), and, have no doubt: Ukrainians lost some, too. But, overall outcome of this show-down is clear: day after day, the 27th GMRB and the 3rd MRD were attacking, and attacking, and attacking, wave after wave \u2014 only to get smashed, literally, to pieces. They run into mines, they were hit by artillery, they were hit by Ukrainian ATGMs, then by tanks, and finally by infantry-operated light anti-tank weapons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

But that&#39;s a counterfactual since the then-political situation in Russia would not have permitted those conditions to occur in the first place, since the Russian population was not prepared at all propaganda-wise before the invasion.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine kept trading ground for Russian manpower, until they judged that they were sufficiently weakened to go on the offensive themselves. This is not to downplay Ukrainian losses of course.</p>\n\n<p>And now the Russians are low on manpower, spread over a large area, while their C3 is being hit by long-range arty. Add the systemic issues of corruption, lack of communication and ability to effectively perform combined arms warfare, a tendency to report a rosier picture than the actual reality, Putin allegedly getting personally involved in military decision on the ground, and you&#39;ve got a big problem.</p>\n</div>",

What's more they were localized to a salient where the Ukrainians were fighting with inherent disadvantages with the Russians firing at them from 3 sides. Ukraine has also committed a few blunders such as over committing to the defense of Severodonezk instead of focusing on defending Lyschansk which was across the river and had a high ground, over 3 sides encircled supplied over the river SD.\n\nAll put together, the Russian advance was minor, slow, difficult and aided by Ukrainian blunders and the shape of the front.\n\nNow that we have established the facts, the Russians still did have the strategic initiative, in my eyes two thing caused the slow down of the Russian advance:\n\n1. The Russian forces as well as the Ukrainian forces involved in the previous campaigns in Luhansk were both severely attrited. Both were in poor condition, and since attacking is much harder than defending, the Russians struggled to continue attacking and entered a semi operational pause state.\n2. Ukrainians were forced out of the aforementioned salient, flattening the front and making it much more easily defensible. \n\nSo the Russian continued advance stalled.\n\nThe were two major factors (and many other smaller) that contributed to the reversal:\n\n1. This whole time Ukraine has been training reserves for offensive actions. training that took months. These units were not committed previously even in the face of high losses and loss of terrain in Luhansk, but prepared for an offensive. We had reports of the Polish, Czech and other tanks as well as western M-113's held back, and the units conducting training in Kharkiev oblast and north of Kherson. We had reports of men drafted in the first two months of the invasion and have been trained up and conducting mechanized infantry training since.   \nUkraine drafted and trained a massive offensive force through deliberate actions and planning.  \nIn the same time Russia went from ad hock to the next ad hock method to slowly creep \"silent\" mobilization, that was not producing anywhere near enough forces.  \nAs a result, once the Ukrainians commited these significant forces that were held back, they gained **significant numerical advantage** wherever these units where thrown in. Not just that, these units were fresh, well equipped, high moral and highly trained in offensive operations together.\n2. HIMARS. the degradation of forward Russian ammunition stores, command posts, logistics hubs and so on cannot be overstated. This has also caused a significant moral hit as well.

I'm optimistic about Ukraine, but I'm skeptical at the near-celebratory tone of my fellow Westerners. Nothing's saying it won't bog right back down. Ukraine does not have some unstoppable super-army with unlimited offensive power. After some impressive gains their offensive campaign is pretty much concluding. \n\nIt's a matter of interior lines really. As Ukraine pushes Russia back, Russia has less front they have to defend, which allows them to consolidate troops.\n\nI'm not super thrilled about the idea of Ukraine making concessions to Russia but I question the amount of time they can maintain this. This war going long is not in Ukraine's favor. Even with a greater technological advantage on Ukraine's side, Russia still has manpower and plenty of arms. Ukraine's population is a third of Russia's, even with people fleeing mobilization and ideological supremacy in Ukraine, Russia still has a significant advantage here. \n\nEconomically speaking, the West put economic recovery from Covid on hold to back Ukraine in this war. The clock is ticking on how long the people of the West are willing to continue to support this amidst increasing inflation and fuel prices. It's not just about arms, it's about humanitarian and economic aid. Russia has Ukraine by the economic balls right now. If people in the West, especially the US, become weary of supporting a European quagmire at the cost of our own prosperity then things very well could change again.\n\nI honestly think that digging in and making this go as long as possible is Russia's most viable strategy. If they want to walk out of this with those annexed oblasts and a potential deal to keep Ukraine out of NATO then that's their best bet.\n\nAgain, I'm hoping for Ukraine here but it's not over until it's over. The longer this goes there may be some point where a negotiated peace becomes more strategically viable than total victory. There comes a point where it's better to take what you can get than to risk it turning back around and hoping for another favorable reversal.",

My position is that Elon Musk can know more than a layperson and still not be worth the attitude of \"Everyone should listen to him about space and transportation\" that you originally claimed, not that he knows nothing at all. There is a *large* chasm in expertise and knowledge between a manager and the actual expert the manager hires. To deny that is very much to give the boss the employee's credentials.\n\nAnd **of course** I'd trust the people who are actually producing entertainment and media in Disney over Bob Iger. Why the hell would I ask Bob Iger about entertainment when I could ask Joss Whedon? Bob Iger surely does know a fair bit about entertainment, but it's not his department, so to speak. If I have a question about a student's science class, I don't ask the english teacher, even though the english teacher surely knows more than me. I'm not going to ask the twitter hype man who's trying to make a buck off everyone on the planet ten times over when I have a science question.\n\nAnd this is all ignoring the elephant in the room which is Elon Musk's conflicts of interest. He could be J. B. Straubel's better for all any of us give a shit and still be less reliable than a tabloid writer when it comes to space transportation. Just look at his nonsense about hyperloop, or floating trucks nonsense.\n\nIt's like trusting Putin for honest information about the Russian military. Do I think he knows more than me about the Russian military? Obviously, but that doesn't make him the slightest damn bit credible when he opens his mouth. You understand that this is a subreddit which encourages skepticism, right? What has Elon Musk actually done to ***demonstrate*** credibility? What is his track record for good information about space and transportation? When has he proven that his public statements are reliable sources of information? Since we *know* he has a history of blowing smoke up everyone's ass, how do we discern when he's blowing smoke vs. when he's actually contributing in good faith?",

We know that those \\*were\\* unique to 12th GUMO two years ago, but they very publicly went into mass production in May of this year. It is entirely possible that the vehicles seen on the train where the first batch of these new Vystrals being sent to the front. There's simply not enough evidence to know for sure, but I will point out the barrels on those Spicas were not painted, unlike all of the ones we've seen with 12th GUMO, implying that they may be new. Sending these new vehicles to the front would also align with Telegram posts about Putin sending \"new technology\" to the front to help. Even if they are 12th GUMO, they do not necessarily indicate nuclear use is imminent. They could be moving for exercises, they could be assets being transferred to the front (we've seen strategic deterrence troops being forced to fight), it could literally be an internal transfer of equipment. Calling it a \"nuke train\" is complete scaremongering bullshit of the highest order.  \n\n\nEDIT: As an aside, the Russians literally know what game they are playing here. They know if they move these things around and let people see them, people in the West will hear about it and get panicky. For example, Rybar originally posted the video of the train and did not speculate about nuclear weapons at all. Then, a pro-Russia \"OSINT\" account literally called ***NovichokRossiya*** picked it up, implied it was 12th GUMO, and then it got retweeted by one independent analyst and so on.",
