        "body": "Another report on the drones that Ukraine is using for attacks into Russia.  They are not just using newly designed drones like the Liutyi. The UAF continues to modify old Soviet weapons in order to supplement the war effort.  I know much of the information won't be available for a long time but I'd love to know all the little details that are being collected about the success and failures of different types of drones.  \n\n[Ukraine\u2019s \u2018Drone Army\u2019 Supplemented by Big Old Soviet Reconnaissance UAVs | Kyiv Post | March 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/29870)\n\n*Images that have appeared on social media following Ukraine\u2019s recent successful attacks on Russian oil refineries suggest it\u2019s not just the new generation of drones that do the business.*\n\n*Forbes reported that March 16 posts on social media showed the wreckage of a Tupolev Tu-143 unmanned reconnaissance drone that was shot down near Bryansk, Russia, at around the same time as other drones had struck oil refineries in the Samara and Krasnodar regions.*\n\n*Forbes drew the conclusion that a lack of ammunition had forced Kyiv to drag yet more old Soviet weaponry from storage to attack Russian targets. The Russian state news agency TASS also reported that Moscow\u2019s air defenses had shot down two similarly aged Tu-141 drones in the Bryansk region on Sunday, March 17.*\n\n*It was not clear whether the same types of drones had been used in the successful strikes on Russian oil facilities, as other types of drone that seemed to have been shot down at the same time also appeared on social media.*\n\n*Much has been made in recent times of the efforts by Ukraine to build on the battlefield success of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), drones, by developing longer range versions that could take the war to Russia\u2019s infrastructure. The re-appearance of the old Tupolev models is more likely to be a \u201chorses for courses\u201d decision rather than desperation on the part of Ukraine.*\n\n*The Tu-143 and its big brother the Tu-141 were originally designed as reconnaissance drones, fitted with electronic surveillance equipment and cameras, and later modified to act as aerial target drones. Compared with most of the modern fixed wing, long-range kamikaze drones used by Ukraine, these are monsters.*\n\n*The Tu141 is powered by a KR-17A turbojet that provides a speed of around 1,000 km/h (620 mph) and a range of around 1,000 kilometers (600+ miles). The UAV is big, 14.33 meters (47 feet) long with a 3.88 meter (12.6 feet) wingspan and weighs in at over 6 tons. Removal of the surveillance gear from the payload compartment would allow the drone to be fitted with a large explosive charge, as much as 300-500 kilograms (600-1,000 pounds).*\n\n*The Tu-143, while much smaller, could still outperform many newer drones. With a launch weight of 1.2 tons, 8 meters (26 feet) long with a 2.24 meters (7 feet) wingspan, its turbojet engine gives it a range of 200 kilometers (125 miles) and a speed of around 950 km/h (590 mph) and could carry a payload of more than 100 kilograms (220 pounds).*\n\n*The Tu-141/143 were designed and built at the Kharkiv State Aircraft Manufacturing Company and came into service in the early 1970s. The factory built around 150 of each, which were taken out of service around 1989. Many of the UAVs were held in storage in Ukraine both during Soviet times and after the fall of the USSR.*\n\n*Some were used as reconnaissance drones following Russia\u2019s 2014 partial invasion, at least two being shot down over eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists. They reappeared again after the 2022 full-scale invasion with more than a dozen used as attack drones in the first year of the war until stocks of more modern Western weapons began to arrive.*\n\n*Despite their age and relative simplicity, they seem to remain effective. As with many older and basic weapons held by Ukraine (and it has to be said Russia, too) the attitude seems to be \u201cif we\u2019ve got them and they work, why not use them?\u201d*",

The Russian state news agency TASS also reported that Moscow\u2019s air defenses had shot down two similarly aged Tu-141 drones in the Bryansk region on Sunday, March 17.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It was not clear whether the same types of drones had been used in the successful strikes on Russian oil facilities, as other types of drone that seemed to have been shot down at the same time also appeared on social media.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Much has been made in recent times of the efforts by Ukraine to build on the battlefield success of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), drones, by developing longer range versions that could take the war to Russia\u2019s infrastructure. The re-appearance of the old Tupolev models is more likely to be a \u201chorses for courses\u201d decision rather than desperation on the part of Ukraine.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Tu-143 and its big brother the Tu-141 were originally designed as reconnaissance drones, fitted with electronic surveillance equipment and cameras, and later modified to act as aerial target drones. Compared with most of the modern fixed wing, long-range kamikaze drones used by Ukraine, these are monsters.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Tu141 is powered by a KR-17A turbojet that provides a speed of around 1,000 km/h (620 mph) and a range of around 1,000 kilometers (600+ miles). The UAV is big, 14.33 meters (47 feet) long with a 3.88 meter (12.6 feet) wingspan and weighs in at over 6 tons. Removal of the surveillance gear from the payload compartment would allow the drone to be fitted with a large explosive charge, as much as 300-500 kilograms (600-1,000 pounds).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Tu-143, while much smaller, could still outperform many newer drones. With a launch weight of 1.2 tons, 8 meters (26 feet) long with a 2.24 meters (7 feet) wingspan, its turbojet engine gives it a range of 200 kilometers (125 miles) and a speed of around 950 km/h (590 mph) and could carry a payload of more than 100 kilograms (220 pounds).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Tu-141/143 were designed and built at the Kharkiv State Aircraft Manufacturing Company and came into service in the early 1970s. The factory built around 150 of each, which were taken out of service around 1989. Many of the UAVs were held in storage in Ukraine both during Soviet times and after the fall of the USSR.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Some were used as reconnaissance drones following Russia\u2019s 2014 partial invasion, at least two being shot down over eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists. They reappeared again after the 2022 full-scale invasion with more than a dozen used as attack drones in the first year of the war until stocks of more modern Western weapons began to arrive.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Despite their age and relative simplicity, they seem to remain effective. As with many older and basic weapons held by Ukraine (and it has to be said Russia, too) the attitude seems to be \u201cif we\u2019ve got them and they work, why not use them?\u201d</em></p>\n</div>",

Both sides are constantly updating their drones and their anti-drone tactics, which depend above all else on the radio connections used to control the unmanned aircraft and to relay the vital intelligence they collect to commanders, artillery batteries and missile launchers. Both sides have invested heavily in radio-frequency jamming and deception \u2014 electronic warfare \u2014 to misdirect missiles and bring down drones, with Ukraine alone losing an estimated five to ten thousand every month.

        "body": "Here's a New York Times article on the latest stop on Speaker Johnson's long journey towards allowing a vote on Ukraine aid. At least it now appears to be nearing an end:\n\nWhen Speaker Mike Johnson opened the floor for questions at a closed-door luncheon fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, Jacquie Colgan asked how, in the face of vehement opposition within his own ranks, he planned to handle aid for Ukraine.What followed was an impassioned monologue by Mr. Johnson in which he explained why continued American aid to Kyiv was, in his view, vital \u2014 a message starkly at odds with the hard-right views that have overtaken his party. He invoked his political roots as a Reagan Republican, denounced President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a \u201cmadman\u201d and conceded the issue had forced him to walk a \u201cdelicate political tightrope.\u201d\n\nReminded by Ms. Colgan, a member of the American Coalition for Ukraine, a nonprofit advocacy group, of the adage that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil was for good people to do nothing, Mr. Johnson replied that he kept a copy of the quotation framed in his office.\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be us,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our job.\u201d\n\nThe exchange reflects what Mr. Johnson has privately told donors, foreign leaders and fellow members of Congress in recent weeks, according to extensive notes Ms. Colgan took during the New Jersey event and interviews with several other people who have spoken with him.While the speaker has remained noncommittal about any one option, he has repeatedly expressed a personal desire to send aid to Ukraine \u2014 something he has voted against repeatedly in the past \u2014 and now appears to be in search of the least politically damaging way to do it.\n\nThe challenge for Mr. Johnson is that any combination of aid measures he puts to a vote will likely infuriate the growing isolationist wing of his party, which considers the issue toxic. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, who has repeatedly said she would call a snap vote to unseat the speaker if he allowed a vote for Ukraine aid before imposing restrictive immigration measures, filed a resolution on Friday calling for his removal, saying she wanted to send him \u201ca warning.\u201d\n\nEven if Ms. Greene follows through on the threat, Mr. Johnson could still hold onto his job. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, has said he believed \u201ca reasonable number\u201d of Democrats would vote to save the speaker were he to face a Republican mutiny for acting on the Senate-passed aid package, though on Friday Mr. Jeffries said that had been \u201can observation, not a declaration.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Friday after Ms. Greene had filed her resolution and the House departed Washington for its Easter recess, Mr. Johnson said that when lawmakers returned in two weeks, they would \u201ctake the necessary steps to address the supplemental funding request.\u201d\u201cWe have done important work discussing options with members,\u201d he said, \u201cand are preparing to complete our plan for action.\u201dPrivately, Mr. Johnson has expressed an interest in linking Ukraine aid to a measure aimed at forcing the Biden administration to reverse its moratorium on liquid natural gas exports, according to three people familiar with his deliberations who were not authorized to discuss them.\n\nMr. Johnson pressed the issue at a White House meeting last month with President Biden and congressional leaders, arguing that by prohibiting new exports of domestic energy, the administration was increasing reliance on Russian gas, effectively enriching Ukraine\u2019s enemy.In that meeting, according to a person familiar with the comments, Mr. Johnson raised the case of Calcasieu Pass 2, a proposed export terminal that would be situated along a shipping channel that connects the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Charles, La., and would dwarf the country\u2019s existing export terminals. The Biden administration in January had paused a decision on whether to approve it.He has puzzled over whether to put the aid to a vote on the House floor packaged with assistance for other U.S. allies, including Israel and Taiwan, or allow lawmakers to vote on them separately to register their support for each individual nation.\n\nWith many Republicans bent on blocking aid to Ukraine, any legislation carrying it would need to be considered using a special procedure that bypasses House rules and requires a two-thirds majority for passage, relying heavily on votes from Democrats. But a combined aid package for both Ukraine and Israel like the one that passed the Senate last month could be doomed by a coalition of right-wing Republicans opposing the money for Kyiv and left-wing Democrats opposing aid for Israel.Mr. Johnson has pondered imposing new sanctions against Russia. And he has debated how the money should be structured \u2014 straight assistance versus a loan \u2014 and whether it should be exclusively for lethal aid, a type of assistance that is more widely supported by his conference, or also include nonmilitary assistance.\u201c\n\nThere is a big distinction in the minds of a lot of people between lethal aid for Ukraine, and the humanitarian component,\u201d Mr. Johnson said at a news conference at the Capitol last week.Both he and Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have publicly floated the idea of paying for some of the aid by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen using legislation called the REPO Act.Mr. Johnson has faced mounting international pressure to allow a vote on aid to Ukraine, fielding almost weekly visits and calls from NATO allies and pro-Ukraine activists both at his offices in Washington and Louisiana. When Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland visited Washington earlier this month, he had a sharp public message for the speaker.\u201cThis is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,\u201d Mr. Tusk told reporters. \u201cThe absence of this positive decision of Mr. Johnson will really cost thousands of lives there \u2014 children, women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nMeeting privately with Mr. Johnson in his office in the Capitol, President Andrzej Duda of Poland appealed to the Louisiana Republican\u2019s respect for President Ronald Reagan, whose portrait hung beside the speaker during the meeting. Mr. Duda quoted Mr. Reagan extensively and praised his willingness to call out good versus evil during the Cold War, according to a person familiar with the comments who requested anonymity to describe them.Some skeptical Ukraine backers, both on and off Capitol Hill, have fretted that Mr. Johnson\u2019s agreeable comments have simply reflected his penchant for telling people what they want to hear. Early in Mr. Johnson\u2019s tenure as speaker, lawmakers noticed that he had a habit of leaving listeners from warring factions with the impression he agreed with each of them.Yet at the fund-raiser in New Jersey last month, he was fairly candid about his calculations.Mr. Johnson told the audience that he was \u201cworking to figure out the best route forward,\u201d Ms. Colgan recalled, adding that he said that half of House Republicans wanted to move it together as a package with Israel and Taiwan, and the other half wanted to do it on its own.\n\nAt a separate fund-raiser in Binghamton for a congressman in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley last month, Christina Zawerucha, the executive director of the Together for Ukraine Foundation, and Anatoliy Pradun, the group\u2019s president, who was born and raised in Ukraine, approached the speaker to press him on holding a vote.Mr. Pradun had hoped to appeal to Mr. Johnson\u2019s faith by telling him of the strong evangelical Christian community in Ukraine. But realizing they had little time to make their case, Ms. Zawerucha and Mr. Pradun instead gave the speaker a pin with the Ukrainian and American flags, showed him their poster advertising an upcoming interfaith vigil for Ukraine and implored him to schedule a vote on aid to Kyiv.\u201cHe didn\u2019t turn us away,\u201d Ms. Zawerucha said. \u201cHe pointed at our poster and said, \u2018I will take care of this. I will take care of this.\u2019\u201dWhen Ms. Zawerucha relayed the interaction to fellow activists after the luncheon, they asked what she thought he meant.\u201cAnd at this point, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been over a month since Speaker Johnson said he would take care of this. And a vote for Ukraine still has not been allowed on the floor.\u201d\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/us/politics/speaker-mike-johnson-ukraine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/us/politics/speaker-mike-johnson-ukraine.html)",

I've seen it argued that the single most effective politician of the 21st century in terms of influence on world events and geopolitics was not Xi, Putin or any US president, but rather Osama bin Laden.\n\nYou've made a good post, but I'd like to highlight the distinction between \"having an effect\" on geopolitics and \"having a *desired* effect\" on geopolitics. Osama bin Laden's *desired* result of 9/11 was the US withdrawing from the Middle East, which he thought would give him the chance to overthrow his relatives in KSA and institute a more pious government.\n\nInstead he provoked a massive increase in US engagement in the Middle East, with even stronger ties between the US and Saudi governments. He retroactively changed his stated goals to pretend his plan had always been to draw the US into an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, but this was just an attempt to save face and adapt to the new situation.\n\nOsama Bin Laden lived just enough to see the Arab Spring undermine Al Qaeda entire ethos by accomplishing multiple regime changes through popular protests where Al Qaeda's terrorism had accomplished absolutely nothing. Of course if he'd lived longer, he'd have seen the collapse of hope for the peaceful transition of the Arab Spring and a return to the bloody authoritarians the region was used to, followed later by the US gradually withdrawing from the region.\n\nAs for Hamas, they've also had a major effect, but not necessarily a desired effect. In the narrow sense that Israel is more international isolated than ever, they're currently succeeding, but in every other sense they might be losing. Hamas made themselves toxic for the neighbouring Arab states harbouring them, and life is now far worse for Palestinians. We'll need to see how the dust settles in a few years, but it's possible Hamas end up being seen as discredited if the state of the Palestinians is by every metric far worse than it was before Oct 7.\n\nTo reiterate, you're completely right that such terrorist acts do have a significant influence upon geopolitics, I just wanted to make sure anyone reading that didn't mistake that influence as meaning terrorists are akin to puppet masters rather than chaos agents.",

Apologies in advance for the long response.\n\nAn army which does not commit what we nowadays call war crimes is, historically speaking, an outlier. The norm throughout history has been that the conquering army simply rapes, murders and loots their way through the area of the conquered civilians. Especially so when the soldiers are motivated by a strong sense of religious or ethnic animosity and desire for vengeance in response to past atrocities (whether real or perceived). There are only a few well-disciplined, mostly 20th and 21st century, mostly professional, mostly Western-style armies that might be said to have (mostly) kept to the modern laws of war in a hot war. Even with all modern precautions in place, it's to be expected that *some* war crimes are committed by the conquering army, given the general breakdown of oversight, high-running emotions and stress, and because war is frankly terrifying and people will do crazy things to survive. As you say, to expect zero war crimes would be naive, even though it's the ideal we should strive for, but since *some* war crimes are basically unavoidable the interesting question is not whether small-scale war crimes have been committed, but whether they are met with repercussions. Do the perpetrators get punished, ignored, or do they get a medal?\n \nThe reason why the video of half-naked Palestinian prisoners of war being forced to chant anti-Hamas songs is significant and should not be dismissed as \"impossible to take that seriously\", is because (a) it is, in fact, legally a war crime to humiliate POWs like this, and (b) if the Israeli soldiers who filmed this have no qualms about publishing this kind of incriminating evidence, it raises the question what other kind of war crimes they are committing which they are *not* comfortable sharing. Once captured, a POW is completely at the mercy of the army they have surrendered to. They are utterly defenseless and their captors wield basically absolute power over them, so seeing video evidence of Israeli soldiers gleefully abusing that absolute power (in dozens of videos) should be very concerning to a neutral observer. Forcing somebody who is at your mercy to undress and beg and humiliate themselves is, objectively, a cruel act. The veil between civilization and barbarism is a thin one, and an army that allows its soldiers to perform such cruelty without cracking down hard on it opens the door for more and *worse* kinds of cruelty to be inflicted upon its prisoners (and the civilian population in general). The idea that an army can manage to restrain its soldiers to \"only a little war-criming\" or committing only \"non-serious\" war crimes goes against basically everything we know about human psychology and millennia of recorded history of warfare, *especially* when the army is composed not of professionals with years of training and psychological evaluations, but consists in large part of young conscripts. And in fact we have lots of credible reports by e.g. [Amnesty ](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/11/israel-opt-horrifying-cases-of-torture-and-degrading-treatment-of-palestinian-detainees-amid-spike-in-arbitrary-arrests/) of Palestinian prisoners being blindfolded, beaten, kicked, threatened and otherwise degraded. (And these are the people that survived being taken captive. As the example of Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim, and Samer Talalka showed, the number of unarmed people who try to surrender but are killed regardless is non-zero.) \n\n> Compared to HAMAS they are literal angels. Consider the enviroment Israeli soldiers operate in and imagine HAMAS operating in an israeli city unimpeded.\n\nI take some issue with your statement that \"Compared to Hamas the IDF are literal angels\". First of all, because it's a whataboutism, which is a fallacy in itself. Secondly, because \"Hamas-level\" is not the standard we should compare the IDF to, and \"they are savages who commit war crimes, therefore we are also justified in committing war crimes\" is the kind of dehumanizing train of thought which historically often escalates to genocide or other crimes against humanity. I also agree with professor Mordechai when he writes that \"*historical grievances and atrocities [do not] justify additional atrocities in the present*\". I'm more of an ethical consequentialist: the *manner* in which an army commits atrocities is not so relevant as the question of whether they *are* committing atrocities. If you take issue with Hamas brutally killing 1200 Israeli civilians on October 7th, but not with the IDF brutally killing >30.000 Palestinian civilians in the days since (and actually call them \"literal angels\") because Hamas was more *savage* about it, then I don't think you are not making an objective ethical assessment. Whether you are an Israeli festival-goer shot by Hamas with an automatic rifle, or a Palestinian teenager killed by indiscriminate bombing, you're just as dead and your family will mourn you just the same. Finally, I am not very interested in discussing which side would commit the most war crimes in a hypothetical situation. Speculating on what Hamas would do unimpeded in an Israeli city isn't very interesting, because whatever the answer is - although of course I know it's not pretty - it is an irrelevant distraction, as it is actually the IDF who is *currently* rampaging through Palestinian cities essentially unimpeded, so analyzing their behavior is a lot more consequential (and less speculative).\n\nSo where does that leave us? To me it seems clear that both Hamas and the IDF have committed and are committing war crimes on a massive scale, resulting in thousands of innocents civilians death on both sides (though it should be noted that the number of Palestinian victims is an order of magnitude higher) and over a million Palestinians and tens if not hundreds of thousands of Israelis displaced from their home (which in the case of the Gazans often have been destroyed). Furthermore, as we speak, there is a massive humanitarian crisis on the Palestinian side due to a shortage of food, water, medicine and the destroyed infrastructure, exacerbated by Israel blocking of humanitarian aid. I don't know whether or not the IDF's end goal is to totally ethnically cleanse Gaza of all Palestinians, but I think their actions are indistinguishable from the case where it *is* the end goal. And finally, all these war crimes might be, if not forgivable, at least be somewhat understandable if they actually were effective in freeing the hostages, permanently taking out Hamas, and establishing long-term peace. However, as we've discussed earlier in the comment chain, I think in all those war goals the current Israeli strategy is not only ineffective but actively counterproductive. \"Worse than a crime, it's a mistake.\"",

The idea that an army can manage to restrain its soldiers to &quot;only a little war-criming&quot; or committing only &quot;non-serious&quot; war crimes goes against basically everything we know about human psychology and millennia of recorded history of warfare, <em>especially</em> when the army is composed not of professionals with years of training and psychological evaluations, but consists in large part of young conscripts. And in fact we have lots of credible reports by e.g. <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/11/israel-opt-horrifying-cases-of-torture-and-degrading-treatment-of-palestinian-detainees-amid-spike-in-arbitrary-arrests/\">Amnesty </a> of Palestinian prisoners being blindfolded, beaten, kicked, threatened and otherwise degraded. (And these are the people that survived being taken captive. As the example of Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim, and Samer Talalka showed, the number of unarmed people who try to surrender but are killed regardless is non-zero.) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Compared to HAMAS they are literal angels. Consider the enviroment Israeli soldiers operate in and imagine HAMAS operating in an israeli city unimpeded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I take some issue with your statement that &quot;Compared to Hamas the IDF are literal angels&quot;. First of all, because it&#39;s a whataboutism, which is a fallacy in itself. Secondly, because &quot;Hamas-level&quot; is not the standard we should compare the IDF to, and &quot;they are savages who commit war crimes, therefore we are also justified in committing war crimes&quot; is the kind of dehumanizing train of thought which historically often escalates to genocide or other crimes against humanity. I also agree with professor Mordechai when he writes that &quot;<em>historical grievances and atrocities [do not] justify additional atrocities in the present</em>&quot;. I&#39;m more of an ethical consequentialist: the <em>manner</em> in which an army commits atrocities is not so relevant as the question of whether they <em>are</em> committing atrocities. If you take issue with Hamas brutally killing 1200 Israeli civilians on October 7th, but not with the IDF brutally killing &gt;30.000 Palestinian civilians in the days since (and actually call them &quot;literal angels&quot;) because Hamas was more <em>savage</em> about it, then I don&#39;t think you are not making an objective ethical assessment. Whether you are an Israeli festival-goer shot by Hamas with an automatic rifle, or a Palestinian teenager killed by indiscriminate bombing, you&#39;re just as dead and your family will mourn you just the same. Finally, I am not very interested in discussing which side would commit the most war crimes in a hypothetical situation. Speculating on what Hamas would do unimpeded in an Israeli city isn&#39;t very interesting, because whatever the answer is - although of course I know it&#39;s not pretty - it is an irrelevant distraction, as it is actually the IDF who is <em>currently</em> rampaging through Palestinian cities essentially unimpeded, so analyzing their behavior is a lot more consequential (and less speculative).</p>\n\n<p>So where does that leave us? To me it seems clear that both Hamas and the IDF have committed and are committing war crimes on a massive scale, resulting in thousands of innocents civilians death on both sides (though it should be noted that the number of Palestinian victims is an order of magnitude higher) and over a million Palestinians and tens if not hundreds of thousands of Israelis displaced from their home (which in the case of the Gazans often have been destroyed). Furthermore, as we speak, there is a massive humanitarian crisis on the Palestinian side due to a shortage of food, water, medicine and the destroyed infrastructure, exacerbated by Israel blocking of humanitarian aid. I don&#39;t know whether or not the IDF&#39;s end goal is to totally ethnically cleanse Gaza of all Palestinians, but I think their actions are indistinguishable from the case where it <em>is</em> the end goal. And finally, all these war crimes might be, if not forgivable, at least be somewhat understandable if they actually were effective in freeing the hostages, permanently taking out Hamas, and establishing long-term peace. However, as we&#39;ve discussed earlier in the comment chain, I think in all those war goals the current Israeli strategy is not only ineffective but actively counterproductive. &quot;Worse than a crime, it&#39;s a mistake.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

How is any of this debatable? I would really like for you to think of a better way for this to play out.</p>\n</div>",

They can use old inventory of M26 rockets for the booster. So it allows them to use junk boosters and get better range than the GMLRS too, with a bigger warhead as well.

The ATACMS has an adequate payload and it's biggest limitation for range wasn't engineering it was a ballistic missile treaty that we're not even following anymore. There is no way a lofted glide bomb will outdo 500 km of range, so there is no point building them. \n\nWhat would be better is to make the JDAM-ER rocket assisted from aerial launch, so it doesn't need the altitude and proximity to target as current versions.

During this difficult time, our society has shown an example of true solidarity, cohesion, and mutual support.\n\nI know that among those who are now sending words of sympathy to the families of the victims are people of different nationalities, from all regions of our country, of all ages, including children, schoolchildren and students. Those who planned this terrorist attack hoped to sow panic and discord in our society, but they were met with unity and determination to resist this evil.\n\nI ask you to report today on how the investigative actions and operational search work are going to identify everyone involved in the terrorist attack, its customers and organizers.\n\nDespite our universal pain and sorrow, compassion and legitimate desire to punish all the perpetrators of this brutal crime, the investigation must be carried out in the most professional manner, objectively, without any political bias.\n\nWe know that the crime was committed by radical Islamists, whose ideology the Islamic world itself has been fighting for centuries. But we also see that the United States, through various channels, is trying to convince its satellites and other countries of the world that, according to their intelligence data, there is supposedly no Kiev trace in the Moscow terrorist attack, that the bloody terrorist attack was carried out by followers of Islam, members of the ISIS organization banned in Russia.\n\nWe know by whose hands this atrocity was committed against Russia and its people. We are interested in who the customer is. In the course of joint work between our intelligence services and law enforcement agencies, it is necessary to obtain answers to a number of questions.\n\nFor example: are radical and even terrorist Islamic organizations really interested in striking Russia, which today stands for a fair solution to the escalating Middle East conflict? And how do radical Islamists, who position themselves, by the way, as devout Muslims, professing so-called pure Islam, commit serious atrocities and crimes during the holy month of Ramadan for all Muslims?\n\nThese, as well as other, more specific, professional questions for an objective investigation of the crime committed in Moscow, have to be answered. One thing is absolutely clear: the terrible crime committed on March 22 in the capital of Russia is an act of intimidation, as I have already said.\n\nAnd the question immediately arises: who benefits from this? This atrocity may be only a link in a whole series of attempts by those who have been fighting our country since 2014 at the hands of the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime. And the Nazis, as is well known, never disdained to use the most dirty and inhumane means to achieve their goals.\n\nEspecially today, when their advertised counter-offensive has completely failed. This is already recognized by everyone and is not disputed. The Russian Armed Forces hold the initiative along the entire line of combat contact, and all the measures taken by the enemy to stabilize the front do not bring success.\n\nHence the attempts to enter and gain a foothold in our border territories, shelling, including using multiple launch rocket systems, of peaceful neighborhoods, civilian infrastructure, including energy infrastructure, attempted missile attacks on the Crimean Bridge and the peninsula itself.\n\nBloody acts of intimidation, such as the terrorist attack committed in Moscow, quite logically fit into this series. The goal, as I already said, is to sow panic in our society and at the same time show our own population that all is not lost for the Kyiv regime.\n\nYou just need to follow the orders of your Western curators, fight to the last Ukrainian, obey the command from Washington and adopt a new law on mobilization, create something like the Hitler Youth in its new edition, of course. To use this new weapon and additional money, a significant part of which can be stolen and put, as is usual in Ukraine today, in one\u2019s pocket.\n\nBy the way, Ukrainian nationalists had such an association back in the 20s of the last century - the Union of Ukrainian Nationalist Youth, which then became part of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists.\n\nOf course, we also need to answer the question: why did the terrorists try to go to Ukraine after committing the crime, who was waiting for them there? It is clear that those who support the Kiev regime do not want to be accomplices in terror and sponsors of terrorism. But there are really a lot of questions.\n\nPlease report regularly on the progress of the investigation.\n\nPlease also inform us about what measures are being taken at the federal and regional levels to support the families of the dead and wounded, and how the work of medical and social services is organized. I have already discussed all these issues with my colleagues several times, but today, as agreed, we will talk about this in more detail.\n\nPlease, let's start working. Alexander Ivanovich, please.\n\nA. Bastrykin :  Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!\n\nThe Investigative Committee continues active work to investigate the criminal case of the terrorist attack in the Crocus City Hall concert hall. The investigation has established a complete chronology of the events that took place.\n\nOn March 22 at 18:54, four criminals in a Renault car drove up to the building of the Crocus City Hall concert hall, where they began to wait for the audience to arrive.\n\nAt 19:58, terrorists armed with automatic firearms, while near the Crocus City Hall building, opened fire on visitors who were on the street.\n\nHaving entered the lobby of the building, and then into the concert hall, they continued shooting at all citizens they noticed, regardless of gender and age.\n\nUsing gasoline they brought with them in plastic bottles, they set fire to the premises and left the building at 8:11 p.m. While leaving the parking lot in a car, the criminals at high speed hit pedestrians - a family with two young children. The children suffered serious injuries and were hospitalized.\n\nAll the attackers were detained in the Bryansk region during a pursuit along the highway leading in the direction of the Russian-Ukrainian border.\n\nDuring the inspection, two AK-74 assault rifles, more than 500 rounds of ammunition, 28 magazines with cartridges, and bottles with gasoline residues were found and seized at the scene of the incident. The inspection of the crime scene continues with the participation of forensic specialists and experts from the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation.\n\nIn addition, more than 200 inspections, searches and seizures were carried out, during which more than 1,000 different objects relevant to the investigation were seized.\n\nDuring a search in the apartment where the accused lived, in addition to traces of their hands, fragments of fabric and tools that were used in preparing the attack were found.\n\nA Makarov pistol without cartridges and a Kalashnikov assault rifle magazine with 30 rounds of ammunition were found in the criminals' car. For all seized items, weapons and ammunition, 90 forensic examinations were ordered: ballistic, genetic, fingerprinting.\n\nThe four perpetrators of the terrorist attack have been charged and taken into custody. All the accused, during interrogation and in court, admitted their guilt and gave detailed testimony about the circumstances of the crime, about the customers and persons who assisted in the preparation of the terrorist attack.\n\nThe investigation also identified and detained three more people who assisted in the preparation of the terrorist attack: they provided an apartment for living, a car for transportation, and transported funds. A petition has been sent to the court to take them into custody in relation to these persons.\n\nInitial results of the investigation indicate that the attack was carefully planned and prepared. The attack killed 139 people. Of these, 75 have been identified today. Among the dead are three children. Identification of the dead continues.\n\nOf the total [deaths], 137 people died at the scene of the terrorist attack, two died in medical institutions. 40 people died from gunshot wounds, two people died from a combination of gunshot and stab wounds, and 45 people died as a result of the fire from exposure to high temperatures and combustion products. 182 people received injuries of varying severity.\n\n160 forensic and genetic examinations have been ordered and are being carried out to establish the cause of death and identify the victims. 131 victims and more than 500 witnesses were questioned. From the testimony of eyewitnesses it follows that the fire in the auditorium occurred as a result of the actions of the accused, who spilled gasoline they brought with them onto the chairs and walls and committed arson.\n\nIn this regard, the investigation is checking the possibility of violation of safety requirements and the fire extinguishing system in the Crocus City Hall concert hall. For this purpose, consoles, electronic units and control devices for the fire safety system of the concert hall were confiscated. They are aimed at researching and extracting information about the operating mode of fire safety systems at the time of the terrorist attack. The contents of the fire-fighting system server are being studied with the participation of experts. ...\n\n(continued due to character limit)",

Identification of the dead continues.</p>\n\n<p>Of the total [deaths], 137 people died at the scene of the terrorist attack, two died in medical institutions. 40 people died from gunshot wounds, two people died from a combination of gunshot and stab wounds, and 45 people died as a result of the fire from exposure to high temperatures and combustion products. 182 people received injuries of varying severity.</p>\n\n<p>160 forensic and genetic examinations have been ordered and are being carried out to establish the cause of death and identify the victims. 131 victims and more than 500 witnesses were questioned. From the testimony of eyewitnesses it follows that the fire in the auditorium occurred as a result of the actions of the accused, who spilled gasoline they brought with them onto the chairs and walls and committed arson.</p>\n\n<p>In this regard, the investigation is checking the possibility of violation of safety requirements and the fire extinguishing system in the Crocus City Hall concert hall. For this purpose, consoles, electronic units and control devices for the fire safety system of the concert hall were confiscated. They are aimed at researching and extracting information about the operating mode of fire safety systems at the time of the terrorist attack. The contents of the fire-fighting system server are being studied with the participation of experts. ...</p>\n\n<p>(continued due to character limit)</p>\n</div>",

The necessary investigative actions are being carried out in the case to identify all those involved in the crime, including those who ordered and organized the crime. The investigation into the case continues.\n\nThe report is finished.\n\nVladimir Putin:  Thank you.\n\nTatyana Alekseevna, please.\n\nT. Golikova :  Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich! Dear Colleagues!\n\nDuring the period since the terrorist attack, 145 people were hospitalized in inpatient facilities of medical organizations. The structure of injuries is dominated by gunshot wounds, combined and combined injuries, and poisoning by combustion products.\n\nTo date, 52 patients who were hospitalized due to improvement in condition have been discharged for observation at the place of residence. 93 people are receiving hospital treatment, including five children. Doctors continue to fight for the lives of nine victims, including one child. Their condition is assessed as extremely serious. 29 patients are in serious condition, 30 patients are in moderate condition and 25 patients: their condition has improved and they are being prepared for discharge.\n\nThe most severe patients today are concentrated in Moscow and federal medical institutions. During this period of time, outpatient care was provided to 150 patients, and this figure is changing. I think it will change because people who were able to go home are now turning to treatment facilities.\n\nPsychiatrists and psychologists from the Serbsky Institute, the Federal Medical and Biological Agency, the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia, Moscow, the Moscow Region and volunteer psychologists are involved in providing assistance to victims and family members.\n\nDuring the most acute period, at least 50 ambulance teams, disaster medicine services of the Moscow Region, the city of Moscow, and federal medical organizations were simultaneously at the scene of the terrorist attack. In total, 203 emergency medical teams and air ambulances provided assistance to the victims.\n\nConsidering the scale of the incident, in medical institutions located in the Moscow region, the city of Moscow, in federal medical institutions of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, the Federal Medical-Biological Agency and the Ministry of Defense, one and a half thousand beds were almost immediately deployed, including intensive care units, surgical, burns. And all teams arrived at work to provide medical assistance.\n\nCitizens of Russia, despite the sufficiency of blood and its components, unanimously responded to the misfortune and came to blood donation points to help the victims. I can say that, according to estimates from the Federal Medical and Biological Agency, over two days off the country\u2019s donor centers received 11 thousand 822 donors, prepared four thousand 624 liters of whole blood and one thousand 130 liters of plasma. The work of donor centers continues today.\n\nThe leadership of Moscow and the Moscow region, in order to provide support to the families of those killed, died and injured as a result of a terrorist act, decided to establish one-time payments in the amount of three million rubles for each person killed or died, in the amount of one million rubles - for those who received or are receiving medical care in inpatient hospitals institutions and in the amount of 500 thousand rubles - those who received medical care on an outpatient basis.\n\nFor residents of Moscow and other regions, payments are made by the Moscow Government, for residents of the Moscow region - by the Moscow Region Government. Payments have begun and will continue as documents are received.\n\nAlso, to provide assistance to the victims and families of the victims, a working group was created in the Social Fund and an operational headquarters in Rostrud. Today, proactively, without requiring documents, 22 pensions have already been assigned in the event of the loss of a breadwinner, of which 19 are insurance and three are social. Payment of pensions will be made as soon as possible as soon as the bank details are provided to us.\n\nOutreach work has been organized with relatives and friends of the deceased regarding the payment of funeral benefits and the further provision of documents for compensation. Similar work has been organized with employers. Work has also been organized to assign payments for compulsory social insurance against accidents at work.\n\nI would like to say, Vladimir Vladimirovich, that as all the victims and dead are identified, assistance will be provided to the families, and we will keep this issue under constant control.\n\nI would also like to say that in the first hours after receiving information about the terrorist attack, volunteers, as well as concerned citizens, joined the relief work. On March 23, the \u201cWe Are Together\u201d movement opened a fundraiser for targeted assistance to the families of those killed and injured in the terrorist attack. I report that at the moment the amount of funds raised is almost one billion rubles.\n\nAt the sites where spontaneous memorials are organized and at the assistance center, 11 thousand 371 volunteers provide assistance. On the day of national mourning for the victims, March 24, and today, March 25, actions were and are taking place in the regions that are aimed at uniting the people of the country and demonstrating a sense of belonging to the events that took place. In total, 257.5 thousand volunteers took part in the actions, and 1.6 million of our citizens took part in these actions.\n\nI would also like to say that Russian business also joined in the help: more than 42 transport companies, banks, mobile operators, restaurants, large retail outlets and other businesses provided the assistance that they considered possible to provide.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to our medical workers for the help they provide to the affected citizens, to our caring citizens for the fact that they showed themselves in this difficult hour, came to the aid of people in trouble, once again proving that our country united and in the face of the most difficult situation we are together.\n\nThank you.\n\nVladimir Putin:  Thank you.\n\nYou and I discussed this tragedy from the 22nd to the 23rd late at night, or, one might even say, early in the morning. But we understand, just like the workers of various emergency services, it is also clear that everyone must be prepared for any situation. But the fact that passers-by, and medical workers who are not directly related to emergency services, and employees of other services, unquestioningly simply, immediately found themselves where they should be, helping people - this, of course, demonstrates the maturity of our society and the willingness to defend our interests and fight for yourself, for your loved ones, simply for those people who need help and support. This is a very important characteristic of the current state of our society. You are absolutely right.\n\nWe'll talk about this later. And now I would like to listen to Sergei Semyonovich Sobyanin.\n\nPlease, Sergey Semyonovich.\n\nSergei Sobyanin :  Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!\n\nI report on medical and social assistance to victims of the terrorist attack.\n\nIn total, 44 ambulances worked from Moscow, and the first ambulance arrived four minutes later: at 20:10 a signal was received, and already at 20:14 the first car arrived and provided assistance.\n\nAll applicants were promptly provided with outpatient care. 94 people were hospitalized, admitted to 14 hospitals. They receive assistance from the best Moscow doctors.\n\nWe had many seriously and extremely seriously wounded. There were 12 extremely difficult people, and we have not lost a single one at this time. Moreover, of the 12 extremely severe patients, almost half of these 12 have already been transferred to another category - simply severe patients. There is hope that all 12 will survive. Currently, out of 94 people, 18 people have already been discharged. They continue to work with the rest.\n\nAs for social assistance, as Tatyana Alekseevna said, we, in agreement with colleagues from the Moscow region, from the Government, established the following procedure. Moscow pays one-time benefits to both Muscovites and residents of all other regions. The Moscow region pays by residents of the Moscow region.\n\nReal payments have already begun: 60 people received these benefits, one-time payments. As applications are received, we immediately resolve these issues.\n\n(continued)",

We provide free hotel accommodation and free meals to relatives of victims who come to Moscow to identify bodies or search for their loved ones. We also provide the necessary assistance and support so that they find their loved ones.\n\nThe report is over, Vladimir Vladimirovich.\n\nVladimir Putin:  Now I would like to draw the attention of not only Sergei Semenovich, not only Andrei Yuryevich, who will now take the floor, but in general all our colleagues from the regions of Russia. Sergei Semenovich just spoke about those people who come for identification or to meet with their relatives, who, thank God, were not injured or were only slightly injured, in order to take them home.\n\nWhat I want to say is that in all regions of Russia, where people came from for this event, it is imperative to take control of all the people who need support. Because different life situations occur. Someone even lost their breadwinner and so on.\n\nIt is imperative to analyze everything related to this terrible crime, and be sure to help people without approaching it formally. I ask you to look at this matter with a professional, human eye and support those who need this support and help.\n\nPlease, Andrey Yuryevich. I ask you to.\n\nA. Vorobyov :  Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!\n\nFrom the first moments, I had the opportunity to inform you, report to you and, most importantly, receive recommendations and support. I would like to thank you and my colleagues, the federal departments that are also participating today, and the personnel - all this interaction continues to this day. This was very important for me in order to make all the right decisions.\n\nSergei Semenovich spoke about the role of ambulances, medical institutions, and doctors. I would like to add an important key point when aviation began to operate. The fact is that Crocus is an unbroken chain of buildings and there was a very noticeable danger that the fire could spread to even more serious objects. This, thanks to the work of firefighters and rescuers, was prevented.\n\nFrom the first minutes we received support from people, from our volunteers who were nearby and offered a variety of help.\n\nAs for the rescuers: they work, you know, even now - without breaks, changing. We have reinforced the Ministry of Emergency Situations specialists with general workers - people who help process large amounts of rubble.\n\nI took the liberty of putting down a diagram of the hall - it\u2019s right in front of your eyes. Tomorrow the search operation will be completely completed, and every square meter of the hall - the ground floor, the balcony, the floor above - will be dismantled.\n\nLiterally right away we understood that people needed information about what happened, about this terrible tragedy. That's why we opened a direct line and a help center. It is still located in the support center for \u201cDefenders of the Fatherland\u201d; very trained people work there. We strengthened [them], realizing that there would be a lot of calls. During this time we received about two thousand calls. Of course, the main question is finding relatives and loved ones. Therefore, our colleagues provided a personal reception and tried to answer all questions of interest.\n\nTogether with Moscow, we understood how important it was to synchronize our actions. Everything regarding payments, we accepted a single payment: three million - if our resident died, a million - if he was hospitalized, and 500 [thousand rubles] - [to those] who received certain damages and injuries.\n\nI can say that already on Saturday we made the first payments, because the employees of the Central Bank also came to work and allowed us to carry out these first transactions.\n\nAs already said by Tatyana Alekseevna, I also want to note: I reported to you that that night the Government, represented by Tatyana Alekseevna and the Minister [of Health Mikhail Murashko], toured clinics in the Moscow region, these are three cities: Khimki, Dolgoprudny and Odintsovo.\n\nThe heaviest [patients], and there were a sufficient number of them, at the first opportunity of transportation [were transported] to the Vishnevsky Surgery Center and other federal institutes. We were able to transport them, which allowed us to save lives, because the doctors and the most advanced technologies were used. We understand that there is a struggle for life. I wanted to thank all the doctors, because that night they came to their clinics themselves, understanding what had happened. This was very important for us.\n\nTatyana Alekseevna spoke about the Russian Red Cross Foundation. All this time people offered all kinds of help. And businessmen, Russian business said that they want to help. I am grateful to both the foundation and all the businesses that took part. To date, in addition to the impressive amount that has already been mentioned, 420 thousand transactions of varying volumes have been transferred to these accounts.\n\nWe agreed that we will use these funds jointly, collectively, for the needs of those whose families suffered. You are right in saying that some families - we have some - have lost both parents. We understand, and you told me about this, among other things, that those who are hospitalized today and those who died - we must accompany them for an extended period. We will try to do it with dignity.\n\nOnce again I want to thank everyone for their support. The report is finished.\n\nVladimir Putin:  Good.\n\nSo, colleagues, who would like to add something, provide some additional information, give an assessment?\n\nPlease, Igor Viktorovich.\n\nI. Krasnov :  Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich! Dear Colleagues!\n\nThe terrorist attack that occurred on March 22 identified for all of us tasks that require resolution as a matter of priority and in the near future in order to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy and also to provide maximum assistance to the victims.\n\nI would like to emphasize that from the first hours of the tragedy, all services worked smoothly around the clock and continue to work now. In our work, we paid special attention to the timely blocking of fake and other information that incites interethnic and interfaith conflicts, attempts to sow panic and hatred towards people solely on ethnic grounds.\n\nAccording to our requirements, information was deleted from more than 200 resources, including accounts on the social networks Odnoklassniki, VKontakte and Telegram channels, as well as other sites. In addition to outright fakes, a lot of unverified information appeared, which also destabilized the situation to a certain extent. Even reputable media outlets noted this \u2013 we had to refute such published information with recommendations to media representatives to use data only from official sources.\n\nAlso among the priority measures is an assessment of the work of regulatory authorities that carry out inspections of the activities of the entire concert complex, including fire and anti-terrorism security measures, [assessment of] compliance with the requirements for equipping event security guards in accordance with the number of visitors, evacuation measures, speed of response to a call from a private security company. A full assessment has yet to be given, but we can already say that the scale of the terrorist attack turned out to be many times larger and incomparable with the provisions of the legislation on security at such facilities.\n\nTaking into account the significant increase in the level of terrorist threats, the executive authorities of the constituent entities need to update the safety passports of facilities with large numbers of people. We will do this soon.\n\nAs for residence passports, the facility\u2019s safety passport must be updated at least once every three years and, of course, in accordance with the security requirements clause of the regulatory legal act. Changes in terrorist threats in relation to places where people gather in large numbers is one of the reasons for updating this passport. The facility's safety data sheet was approved on December 17, 2018. Until now, it has not been updated, and the existing terrorist threats, unfortunately, are not taken into account.\n\nIn addition, we will try, together with the Ministry of Emergency Situations, to adjust the existing calculation methods used to carry out calculations confirming the safety and evacuation of people in case of fire. These methods do not allow us to consider the scenario of fires during terrorist attacks and similar arson.\n\nAvailable video recordings of the tragedy indicate a terrorist attack through the main escape routes during a fire - people were forced to flee in the opposite direction from the attackers and seek shelter in various rooms of the building.\n\nIn general, I have given all the necessary instructions to the prosecutor, coordination of the work of law enforcement agencies has been ensured, and supervision of the investigation of the criminal case is being carried out. Around the clock, we continue to take a full range of measures to provide assistance to victims and ensure the rule of law.\n\nThe report is finished.\n\nVladimir Putin:  Thank you.\n\nI ask you to work through all the points that you have just outlined in the most attentive manner. But we will see you soon and talk and return to these issues.\n\n(continued)",

We provide free hotel accommodation and free meals to relatives of victims who come to Moscow to identify bodies or search for their loved ones. We also provide the necessary assistance and support so that they find their loved ones.</p>\n\n<p>The report is over, Vladimir Vladimirovich.</p>\n\n<p>Vladimir Putin:  Now I would like to draw the attention of not only Sergei Semenovich, not only Andrei Yuryevich, who will now take the floor, but in general all our colleagues from the regions of Russia. Sergei Semenovich just spoke about those people who come for identification or to meet with their relatives, who, thank God, were not injured or were only slightly injured, in order to take them home.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to say is that in all regions of Russia, where people came from for this event, it is imperative to take control of all the people who need support. Because different life situations occur. Someone even lost their breadwinner and so on.</p>\n\n<p>It is imperative to analyze everything related to this terrible crime, and be sure to help people without approaching it formally. I ask you to look at this matter with a professional, human eye and support those who need this support and help.</p>\n\n<p>Please, Andrey Yuryevich. I ask you to.</p>\n\n<p>A. Vorobyov :  Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!</p>\n\n<p>From the first moments, I had the opportunity to inform you, report to you and, most importantly, receive recommendations and support. I would like to thank you and my colleagues, the federal departments that are also participating today, and the personnel - all this interaction continues to this day. This was very important for me in order to make all the right decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Sergei Semenovich spoke about the role of ambulances, medical institutions, and doctors. I would like to add an important key point when aviation began to operate. The fact is that Crocus is an unbroken chain of buildings and there was a very noticeable danger that the fire could spread to even more serious objects. This, thanks to the work of firefighters and rescuers, was prevented.</p>\n\n<p>From the first minutes we received support from people, from our volunteers who were nearby and offered a variety of help.</p>\n\n<p>As for the rescuers: they work, you know, even now - without breaks, changing. We have reinforced the Ministry of Emergency Situations specialists with general workers - people who help process large amounts of rubble.</p>\n\n<p>I took the liberty of putting down a diagram of the hall - it\u2019s right in front of your eyes. Tomorrow the search operation will be completely completed, and every square meter of the hall - the ground floor, the balcony, the floor above - will be dismantled.</p>\n\n<p>Literally right away we understood that people needed information about what happened, about this terrible tragedy. That&#39;s why we opened a direct line and a help center. It is still located in the support center for \u201cDefenders of the Fatherland\u201d; very trained people work there. We strengthened [them], realizing that there would be a lot of calls. During this time we received about two thousand calls. Of course, the main question is finding relatives and loved ones. Therefore, our colleagues provided a personal reception and tried to answer all questions of interest.</p>\n\n<p>Together with Moscow, we understood how important it was to synchronize our actions. Everything regarding payments, we accepted a single payment: three million - if our resident died, a million - if he was hospitalized, and 500 [thousand rubles] - [to those] who received certain damages and injuries.</p>\n\n<p>I can say that already on Saturday we made the first payments, because the employees of the Central Bank also came to work and allowed us to carry out these first transactions.</p>\n\n<p>As already said by Tatyana Alekseevna, I also want to note: I reported to you that that night the Government, represented by Tatyana Alekseevna and the Minister [of Health Mikhail Murashko], toured clinics in the Moscow region, these are three cities: Khimki, Dolgoprudny and Odintsovo.</p>\n\n<p>The heaviest [patients], and there were a sufficient number of them, at the first opportunity of transportation [were transported] to the Vishnevsky Surgery Center and other federal institutes. We were able to transport them, which allowed us to save lives, because the doctors and the most advanced technologies were used. We understand that there is a struggle for life. I wanted to thank all the doctors, because that night they came to their clinics themselves, understanding what had happened. This was very important for us.</p>\n\n<p>Tatyana Alekseevna spoke about the Russian Red Cross Foundation. All this time people offered all kinds of help. And businessmen, Russian business said that they want to help. I am grateful to both the foundation and all the businesses that took part.

In this difficult time, our society showed an example of true solidarity, unity, and mutual support.\n\nI know that the victims\u2019 families are receiving words of sympathy from people of different ethnicities, from all regions of our country and of all ages, including children and students. Those who planned this terrorist attack hoped to sow panic and discord in our society but instead met with our unity and resolve to counter this evil.\n\nI would like you to report today on the course of the investigation and search to identify all those who are involved in this terrorist attack and those who ordered and organised it.\n\nDespite our overwhelming pain and grief, sympathy, and legitimate desire to punish all perpetrators of this inhuman atrocity, the investigation must proceed with the utmost professionalism and objectivity, with no political bias whatsoever.\n\nWe know that the crime was perpetrated by radical Islamists. The Islamic World itself has been fighting this ideology for centuries. But we are also seeing how the United States is using different channels to try and convince its satellites and other countries of the world that, according to its intelligence, there is supposedly no sign of Kiev\u2019s involvement in the Moscow terrorist attack, that the deadly terrorist attack was perpetrated by followers of Islam, members of ISIS, an organisation banned in Russia.\n\nWe know whose hands were used to commit this atrocity against Russia and its people.

Doctors are fighting to save the lives of the victims in critical condition. I am confident that they will do everything within their power, and even beyond, to preserve the lives and health of all those injured. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to ambulance crews, air ambulance teams, special forces, firefighters, and rescuers, who made every effort to save lives and rescue people from the gunfire, from the epicentre of fire and smoke, preventing even greater losses.\n\nI cannot but acknowledge the help provided by ordinary citizens who, in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, did not remain indifferent or apathetic and provided first aid and transported the victims to hospitals, working alongside doctors and special agencies\u2019 personnel.\n\nWe will provide the necessary support to all the families whose lives have been affected by this horrible atrocity, to the wounded and the injured. I express my deepest and most sincere condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones. The entire country, all our people are grieving together with you. I declare March 24 a day of national mourning.\n\nAdditional anti-terrorist and anti-sabotage measures have been introduced in Moscow, the Moscow Region, and all regions of the country. Our top priority now is to prevent those behind this bloody massacre from committing another crime.\n\nRegarding the investigation of this crime and the results of the operational search action, we can currently say the following. All four perpetrators, who were directly involved in the terrorist attack, all those who shot and killed people, have been found and apprehended. They attempted to escape and were heading towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary information, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border. A total of 11 people have been detained. The Federal Security Service and other law enforcement agencies are working diligently to identify and expose the accomplice base behind these terrorists: those who provided them with transport, planned escape routes from the crime scene, and prepared caches with weapons and ammunition.\n\nThe investigative and law enforcement agencies will spare no effort to establish all the details of this crime. However, it is already clear that we are confronted not simply with a carefully and cynically planned terrorist attack, but a premediated and organised mass murder of peaceful, defenceless people. The perpetrators cold-bloodedly and deliberately targeted our citizens, including our children, with the intent to kill them at close range. Like the Nazis who once carried out massacres in the occupied territories, they planned to stage a demonstrative execution, a bloody act of intimidation.\n\nAll perpetrators, organisers and masterminds of this crime will face fair and inevitable punishment, whoever they may be and whoever directed them. I emphasise once more: we will identify and bring to justice each and every individual who stands behind these terrorists, those who orchestrated this atrocity, this assault against Russia and our people.\n\nWe understand what the terrorist threat means. In this regard, we rely on cooperation with all states that sincerely share our pain and are ready to really join forces in the fight against a common enemy, international terrorism and all its manifestations.\n\nTerrorists, murderers, those inhumane individuals who have no nationality and cannot have one, face one and the same gloomy prospect \u2013 retribution and oblivion. They have no future. Our common duty now, shared by our comrades\u2013in-arms at the front and all citizens of our country, is to stand united as one. I am confident that we will, for nothing and no one can shake our unity and will, our determination and courage, the strength of the united people of Russia. No force will be able to sow the poisonous seeds of discord, panic or disunity in our multi-ethnic society.\n\nRussia has weathered the most arduous, sometimes unbearable trials more than once, yet it has emerged even stronger. And so it shall be now, as well.\"\n\n**(And it looks like phone calls between: Uzbekistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Syria, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan)**",

They have no future. Our common duty now, shared by our comrades\u2013in-arms at the front and all citizens of our country, is to stand united as one. I am confident that we will, for nothing and no one can shake our unity and will, our determination and courage, the strength of the united people of Russia. No force will be able to sow the poisonous seeds of discord, panic or disunity in our multi-ethnic society.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has weathered the most arduous, sometimes unbearable trials more than once, yet it has emerged even stronger. And so it shall be now, as well.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>(And it looks like phone calls between: Uzbekistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Syria, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan)</strong></p>\n</div>",
