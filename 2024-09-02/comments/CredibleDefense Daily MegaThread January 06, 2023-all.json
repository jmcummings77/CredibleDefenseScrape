Kofman doesn't expect Russia to be capable of launching broader offensives for a long time to come due to lack of equipment/ammo and trained soldiers.\n- Kofman compared the Bakhmut offensive with the battles for Severodonetsk/Lysychansk earlier in the war which were pyrrhic victories for Russia that left their forces so badly attritioned that Ukraine was able to launch the Kharkiv offensive. Says the battle has tactical value, but not strategic value and that both Russia and Ukraine are wrapped up in the sunk cost fallacy for the battle. Says its an important propaganda/morale booster for Ukraine like Mariupol was, and for Russia its clear Putin has the Russian military still focused on taking all of Donetsk, even if that's not really feasible anymore. \n- Kofman is skeptical Russia is capable of a Northern offensive in general, says signs of a reopening of this front would be obvious for months and there aren't any still.\n- Russia went from trading equipment for space at the beginning of the war, to trading bodies for space while trying to reserve ammo and equipment. Unfortunately for Russia, they've used up most of their best troops and equipment already.\n- Ukrainian momentum has slowed significantly since October, we are unlikely to see any major changes on the frontlines until their Spring offensive.\n- The Russian infrastructure campaign remains the biggest threat by far, but it seems likely they are still using too many missiles per month and their stockpiles are dwindling. He gave the figure of 40-50 missiles built every month, but said its a rough estimate and not to quote him on it. Kofman thinks Ukraine is likely to be ok in the medium term, but unclear if they can maintain AD in longterm. It really depends on Western aid and if Russia gets Iranian ballistic missiles. Kofman also makes clear this is one of the most difficult aspects of the war to track as we have no idea how many AD missiles Ukraine has left or the exact state of their power grid.\n\nAs always, it's well worth a listen if you have the time.",

        "body": "Just a few observations regarding weapons announcements today, to get the thread discussions flowing. \n\nTanks. Watch to see if the US package includes subsidies or assistance directly to Eastern European allies.   Ukraine says it needs another 200-300 tanks, and I think there\u2019s going to be one more \u2018serious\u2019 push to supply them from old Soviet stocks before biting the bullet and providing Leopards. Watch for aid awards to Poland and the Czechs particularly, as they have probably the most advanced T-72 variants in active service.  \n\nMuch hinges on the Excalibur Arms plant in Czechia. To recap, this is the private company providing the US/Dutch with 90 T-72EAs under an existing contract and are the swivel for the 40 Moroccan T-72Bs being upgraded to T-72EA standard. EA needs to get it\u2019s delivery time down from a tank every 4 days to 1 every 2, but seeing as how they just employed half the workforce of the Kharkiv tractor works (and the Moroccan T-72Bs don\u2019t need a full rebuild like the 90 boneyard shells rehabbed to make up the 90), this is doable.  They also need a full report on the capability of the T-72EA, but if it lives up to its specs, the 300 tanks can be suppled from a combination of T-72M4s, PT-91s, T-72EAs, and the remainder of the Moroccan T-72s, with (hopefully) a moderate bump from the Bulgarians and Romanians.   As I said, look for aid announcements by the US to allies, or deals where Germany is sending Leopards to the same (The easiest political exit Germany could attain for not providing modern tanks to Ukraine is to give them to someone else first).\n\nAPC/ITV.  Today is the happy day I get to move on from \u2018why isn\u2019t the US providing Bradleys\u2019 to \u2018why isn\u2019t the US providing more Bradleys'. 50ish is an excellent start, a cadre to providing training , and I will be very surprised if the total provided is under 250 when all is said and done. Ukraine needs 400 APCs just to  upgrade the motorized brigades to Mech standard, and (by my admittedly amateur analysis) is working up another 4 brigades to Mech standard from other volunteer units (several of which are \u2018mech lite\u2019 already, with a mishmash of APCs, MRAAPs and unarmored transport) and I would be surprised to not see a brigade or two formed out of the TDBs that fought in the Kherson campaign (those are veteran troops now, no sense in wasting them). The British will come up with something, I have hopes for the Italians, I\u2019m all but certain the French will make another substantial delivery of VABs, and there\u2019s still one final layer of M-113s spread about to snatch up, but as I\u2019ve said before, substantial numbers of Bradley IFVs will be needed.\n\nAssault Guns.  I\u2019m very curious how many AMX-10s France is providing- I estimate 60 for now, but it could be anywhere between 30 and 200.  I am hopeful the gift will loosen up the other available pools of 105mm wheeled guns available. Specifically, I\u2019m hopeful that Italy will produce a batch of Centuaros (being replaced by Centauro II) or that the US will pony up the Striker MGS. The Stryker makes the most sense- There were hopes that the Canadians would buy the retired vehicles which fell through, and now the US is stuck with them. By granting them to Ukraine,  the US Army gets to allocate a portion of the huge aid basket to their replacement value, a back door budget increase (before you snicker, take a look at the back end of the deal for 200 M113s, which is funding their \u2018replacement\u2019).  \n\nSPGs. The only item on Ukraine\u2019s shopping list I don\u2019t see a clear path to is an additional 400 155mm artillery tubes.  Every month there\u2019s a delivery of various Ceasars, Zusanas,  Krabs, ect. But if needs are to be met, M109s need to take up the slack.  Italy has opened the warehouse on its substantial reserve of old M-109A4s, but I haven\u2019t seen a definitive count of how many they have, or how many they\u2019re willing to refurbish. I haven\u2019t seen any mention of the US providing Paladins, but wasn\u2019t the hold up before that they had a Bradley chassis? Just food for thought on that.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Just a few observations regarding weapons announcements today, to get the thread discussions flowing. </p>\n\n<p>Tanks. Watch to see if the US package includes subsidies or assistance directly to Eastern European allies.   Ukraine says it needs another 200-300 tanks, and I think there\u2019s going to be one more \u2018serious\u2019 push to supply them from old Soviet stocks before biting the bullet and providing Leopards. Watch for aid awards to Poland and the Czechs particularly, as they have probably the most advanced T-72 variants in active service.  </p>\n\n<p>Much hinges on the Excalibur Arms plant in Czechia. To recap, this is the private company providing the US/Dutch with 90 T-72EAs under an existing contract and are the swivel for the 40 Moroccan T-72Bs being upgraded to T-72EA standard. EA needs to get it\u2019s delivery time down from a tank every 4 days to 1 every 2, but seeing as how they just employed half the workforce of the Kharkiv tractor works (and the Moroccan T-72Bs don\u2019t need a full rebuild like the 90 boneyard shells rehabbed to make up the 90), this is doable.  They also need a full report on the capability of the T-72EA, but if it lives up to its specs, the 300 tanks can be suppled from a combination of T-72M4s, PT-91s, T-72EAs, and the remainder of the Moroccan T-72s, with (hopefully) a moderate bump from the Bulgarians and Romanians.   As I said, look for aid announcements by the US to allies, or deals where Germany is sending Leopards to the same (The easiest political exit Germany could attain for not providing modern tanks to Ukraine is to give them to someone else first).</p>\n\n<p>APC/ITV.  Today is the happy day I get to move on from \u2018why isn\u2019t the US providing Bradleys\u2019 to \u2018why isn\u2019t the US providing more Bradleys&#39;. 50ish is an excellent start, a cadre to providing training , and I will be very surprised if the total provided is under 250 when all is said and done. Ukraine needs 400 APCs just to  upgrade the motorized brigades to Mech standard, and (by my admittedly amateur analysis) is working up another 4 brigades to Mech standard from other volunteer units (several of which are \u2018mech lite\u2019 already, with a mishmash of APCs, MRAAPs and unarmored transport) and I would be surprised to not see a brigade or two formed out of the TDBs that fought in the Kherson campaign (those are veteran troops now, no sense in wasting them). The British will come up with something, I have hopes for the Italians, I\u2019m all but certain the French will make another substantial delivery of VABs, and there\u2019s still one final layer of M-113s spread about to snatch up, but as I\u2019ve said before, substantial numbers of Bradley IFVs will be needed.</p>\n\n<p>Assault Guns.

The 10th Army Corps will receive the latest samples of Western weapons and equipment.\n\n\ud83d\udd3bWhat else do the Armed Forces of Ukraine plan?\n\nThe 10th Army Corps is not the only tactical formation being created. According to the channel Search Engine ZVI, it is planned to create (https://t. me/poisk_mil/5690) another AK in the Poltava region based on new formations as part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nIn particular, four new brigades are being formed in the Poltava region: 116 - in Opishna, 117 - in Matveevka and 118 OMB - in Golovach, as well as 34th Marine Corps - in Komsomolsk and 229 logistics battalion - in Matyaschevka. Training of officers takes place on the basis of the 179th training center in Poltava.\n\nThe AK\u2019s area of responsibility will include three regions. Now the mobilized personnel are undergoing the necessary training, settling in hotels, civilian infrastructure facilities in large cities.\n\nThis AK will also be supplied with weapons from latest deliveries from Western countries. It is likely that the convoy of Turkish Kirpi armored personnel carriers that arrived (https://t. me/rybar/42487) in Ukraine will be handed over to the Marines of the 34th Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n\ud83d\udd3bThe ongoing reforms in the Armed Forces of Ukraine are designed to facilitate the activities of tactical formations in operational areas. The creation of two corps is a test of the American control system on the battlefield.\n\nIf the plan is successfully implemented in the ranks of the Ukrainian army, the efficiency of making certain decisions will increase, each corps will have attack aviation units (bases in Mirgorod and Dolgintsevo), and the powers of commanders will be expanded.\n\nDeployment map: https://rybar.  ru/piwigo/upload/2023/01/05/20230105175346-8501e5fa.jpg\n\nhttps://t. me/rybar/42494",

Thus, it\u2019d be better to use this data the primary way Oryx data should be used: trend analysis. \n\n\nTo that  extent, that 20% increase was already foretold in June by the CEPA paper you quoted:\n\n> Obviously, the increase in production is associated with the need to replenish missiles for the Iskander complex. Production has risen to about 60 missiles from about 50 a year earlier.\n\nSo, there has been no notable increase in the intervening period (again, assumptions on assumptions.) I have no idea what a missile plant looks like, how it operates or who it hires, but what we do know is that there are reports that the Russians had apparently started planning this bombing campaign back in September, if not earlier. We are in January. If manpower was the bottleneck, it\u2019s hard to understand how that wasn\u2019t fixed yet, but things do take time.

Thus, it\u2019d be better to use this data the primary way Oryx data should be used: trend analysis. </p>\n\n<p>To that  extent, that 20% increase was already foretold in June by the CEPA paper you quoted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, the increase in production is associated with the need to replenish missiles for the Iskander complex. Production has risen to about 60 missiles from about 50 a year earlier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, there has been no notable increase in the intervening period (again, assumptions on assumptions.) I have no idea what a missile plant looks like, how it operates or who it hires, but what we do know is that there are reports that the Russians had apparently started planning this bombing campaign back in September, if not earlier. We are in January. If manpower was the bottleneck, it\u2019s hard to understand how that wasn\u2019t fixed yet, but things do take time. But, again, let\u2019s see where the trend goes from here, especially the factual observed trend of number of strikes and missiles used in them.</p>\n</div>",

Has what France is sending now made it possible to send actual western MBTs? We've already seen the West have no issue sending western SPAA or SPGs, yet there is something significant about actual MBTs like Leos or Abrams. \n\nSure in an emergency when you are getting overrun you might go and use \"iron sights\" and do direct fire with an SPG, but that is an exception that proves the rule, no one in their right mind would use a 20 million $ PzH 2000 as a tank, or direct fire support, or as a tank destroyer. I would also take issue with the comparisons of WW2 doctrines/vehicles as back then the differences between what an \"MBT\" like a Sherman or Panther could do and an SPG like a Stug was not so great. A lot of the specialized platforms in WW2 were just chassis of actual tanks with different weapons systems stuck on the top. But even back then I doubt there are many examples of Hummels, which were purpose built SPGs being used as tanks back then unless things were really no going according to plan. \n\nNow the difference between say an AMX-10 RC and a T-64 is much greater and I doubt an AMX-10 RC would ever be allowed to engage in what an MBT would be asked to do unless it was a huge emergency and even then it would probably not perform as well.

But it would have required standing up to Israel and still nobody in the west is prepared to do that.</p>\n</div>",

There\u2019s two primary ways to invade Crimea: through the Isthmus of Perekop or by amphibious landing (I\u2019m intentionally omitting discussion of going over the Spit or fording the marshes). UAF does not have the capacity to mount and sustain any significant amphibious landing, so the UAF will have seize the Isthmus\n\nLet\u2019s start off with what the war would need to look like before any offensive could be mounted. At the very minimum, the UAF would need to seize and hold Tokmak and Melitopol, and everything west of that to Kherson and the Dnipro. UAF needs stable front lines so the UAF could amass a large force to take the Isthmus. Ideally, the Kerch bridge would be impassable, and the UAF Navy would have some ability to interdict shipping into Sevastopol and Kerch. \n\nThere\u2019s two relevant military campaigns: the siege of Perekop in 1920 and the German Crimean offensive of 1941-42. What both of those campaigns tell us is that if there is a 3:1 advantage for the attacking force, they could break through at great cost. If the RuAF chooses to withdraw at that point, all well and good. But the RuAF may also choose to fortify Kerch and Sevastopol, then those cities can hold out for an extensive period of time. \n\nIt would be a bloody battle. The land is flat, no vegetation, no room to maneuver. UAF has to go right at the RuAF defensive lines and breakthrough; it\u2019s pure strength. \n\nOnce UAF breaks through, maneuver warfare is possible, with the siege of Sevastopol and Kerch being necessary. \n\nAlso, I stand by my statement that I don\u2019t think the RuAF will use nuclear weapons. I will note that the greatest danger for the use of nuclear weapons would happen at the battle for the Isthmus. Concentrated forces attacking Russian land (Russia considers Crimea very differently than the occupied Ukrainian lands) leads to a synergy of an ideal situation for the use of low yield nuclear weapons against tactical targets with Russia\u2019s stated use of nuclear weapons policy. If there is any time in this war I will hold my breath re: nuclear weapons use, it will be then, although I don\u2019t think the RuAF will use them for other reasons. \n\nI do think Ukraine tries to take Crimea if 1) they have taken Tokmak and Melitopol, 2) they have stable front lines to the east, 3) they have sufficient forces to commit against RuAF defending units in Crimea, and 4) there are no prospect of negotiations in the short term.",

But also include wheeled APCs </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5C_of%5C_equipment%5C_of%5C_the%5C_Armed%5C_Forces%5C_of%5C_Ukraine#Wheeled%5C_armoured%5C_personnel%5C_carriers\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_equipment\\_of\\_the\\_Armed\\_Forces\\_of\\_Ukraine#Wheeled\\_armoured\\_personnel\\_carriers</a> </p>\n\n<p>What the Bradley has is armour, speed, firepower and sensors. They weight in the 30-40 tonne class so often 2-3 times heavier than the others, with much more advanced spaced armour than simply hardened steels. So tonne for tonne they are more protected. They can weigh not far less than some old T-72s. The gun is as hard hitting as the heaviest donated APCs etc and their have tracks and a powerful engine so can cross country quickly and across large types of terrain the other wheeled vehicles cannot. There sensors would be on a par at least with the most modern donated vehicles and they usually have a TOW missile so can kill most Russian tanks. </p>\n\n<p>Its easily the most powerful all round troop transport donated so far to the point it could fight as a tank destroyer or other duties. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of front line IFVs these are long in the tooth and supplanted by more modern systems. But its armour/firepower/sensors/mobility would make it about the most powerful fighting vehicle that is not a tank in theatre.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Depends. It is far more economical to introduce many smaller upgrade packages to a vehicle than with structurally change it, or introduce a new system. That\u2019s why you see a number Leopard variants, or the Abrams TUSK package, rather than a Leo 3 or M1A3/Abrams 2. These packages are small, give incremental upgrades, but don\u2019t fundamentally revise the platform. This is also pretty common in aircraft, where block# indicates technology revisions which include minor improvements in capability. Obviously, tho, a lot of small upgrades can over time radically change the feature set. And some platforms, like aircraft, are easier to change than, say, armor. \n\nThen you have very big platform rebuilds, where the DNA mutates, so you have something similar but very improved over the old platform. Think here the FA-18C vs the FA-18E. Both are Hornets, both have a similar doctrinal role, design philosophy, and feature set. But the -18E provided a major in service upgrade which improved many of the C\u2019s weaknesses without having to go through a new platform acquisitions process. It\u2019s cheap, minimizes disruption to the service, but maximizes capability change. A more extreme example would be the Israeli F-16s which are *very* different, custom built aircraft. Many of them are two seater! There were talking about saving money by using a proven platform from a trusted supplier while simultaneously getting something very tailored for your needs. It\u2019s about as close to a new aircraft as you can get without getting a new aircraft. \n\nBut ultimately you do need to actually purchase new gear. Upgrading airframes or tanks can only get you so far, maybe. The big question is how the current platform fails to meet you new needs. In aircraft this is obvious. F-35 is stealth, FA-18E or F-16 isn\u2019t. You want stealth, you gotta buy the new toy. But for tanks, which sit on the other end of the spectrum, you have to ask: what *cant* the Abrams do that you need it to, and is it worth a big and disruptive design and acquisitions program to get that feature(s)? That\u2019s not really an easy question, and often the answer is that the service wants to make a bet on the future when it sets up these programs. There is also a heavy political cost, the USAF got blistered for the F-35s development woes, and I still see people calling it a $1t failure. Like the M-16, the F-35 probably won\u2019t ever shake that bad reputation. \n\nThis is the American take, it\u2019s different across countries. The USSR was very Into iterative design. They were very reluctant to abandon successful designs, instead hoping that they could improve them without upsetting the apple cart. The T-55 and -62 have a lot in common, despite major changes. The T-64 was a more solid break from these designs, but both the T-72 and T-80 are branches which stem from that basic concept. Likewise the T-90 is very related to its forefather, the -72. The T-14 is a more radical departure, but has also struggled. Also complicating the Soviet/Russian position is that they tended to focus on large production numbers. That means a lot of legacy systems, which they maintain through a number of smaller upgrade packages. And because so much DNA is shared, a package developed for the most modern system can potentially be retrofitted to old systems. You also see older systems upgraded much longer, simply because so many are available. For example the T-62M, which is really only something the USSR did because they wanted to keep all their reserve units relevant in a modern fight. \n\nNaval construction is also very different. Warships are far more expensive, and while you still see batch production it\u2019s also more likely that each ship, or small cluster of ships, will receive minor but substantial upgrades during construction. Iirc the Arleigh Burke has gained about 1000t of displacement and 10\u2019 of beam over the years, despite being the same ship doing the same job. To my knowledge the Abrams, on the other hand, has never changed its physical dimensions (tho it does get heavier as more shit is bolted onto it).",

Warships are far more expensive, and while you still see batch production it\u2019s also more likely that each ship, or small cluster of ships, will receive minor but substantial upgrades during construction. Iirc the Arleigh Burke has gained about 1000t of displacement and 10\u2019 of beam over the years, despite being the same ship doing the same job. To my knowledge the Abrams, on the other hand, has never changed its physical dimensions (tho it does get heavier as more shit is bolted onto it).</p>\n</div>",

My degree in business informatics, so... yeah.\n\nAs I understand it, yes and no. Most military machines are actually fairly complex, new radar, infra camera, radio and what not are often changed to newer models and sometimes even new systems are added (many of these are basicly just stapleing it to the outerhull, but some are integrated as well) newer versions might be build by better materials, suspensions etc. and old ones can maybe modernized to said levels as well.\n\nOften, even new developments are ready for upgrades by the time they pass the prototype phase and are wntering mass production.\n\nHowever, integrating new systems to old ones has a \"limit\". That is , as far as I see, being answered by two methods in the development. One is future proofing, when you design something with future systems in mind (example, F-35 had some pretty serious requierments in this category, without knowing any numbers, it should have a sizeable amount of electricity available, because it is expected it is gonna need it in 5-20 years to incorporate the newer stuff. In short it coasted this much, cause the US MoD wanted basically a proof of concept plane, that is also ready for mass production, can be used to build additional variants as needed, had to be able to incorporate new systems for X years and had a bunch of top not h system already in place. Also stealth. It is actually pretty nice that anything has been delivered, not to mention it seems to be the best aircraft in the world atm). The other is \"modular design\" the new german IFV is a good example for that. It has several changable parts from which you can configure the machine. This comes with a bunch of positives, easier to incorporate future technology, you can disperse your industry, not to mention that in the german case gou should be able to reconfigure the vehicle in a FOB basically.\n\nWhy does the MIC is like that? Well, building/designing a complex machine is costly and you have to accept the risk that your design will not win \"wasting\" years and millions or billions in development (new blackhawk helicopter? I am sure that there were at least some hard feelings and swearing at Bell Industries, if I recall the company name correctly)\n\nA new subsystem is often a \"better bet\", cheaper and might not comes with that much strings attached. Of course the payday isnt that much neither and there are many more competitors.\n\nThe military might also not be super keen to replace a parger piece of tried and tested equipment. They have 1000s of engineers that are familiar with it. Workshops, specialized tools, manuals, crew training, enginners and so on. Changing a main battle tank isnt that you just buy a few 100s from the new one. It is a much more complex and expensive process and at the end you might not get that much \"bang for your bucks\" relatively speaking, cause it might be a better tank, but the comperably \"greenish\" crew in one might be two veterans with an older units which is looking at its hard factor might not be that far back from your new one.\n\nThis is far from a complete answer and I am sure that I left out a bunch of important elements. Hopefully more knowledgeable folls will come and add it/correct my mistakes. Still, hope it helps",

Please feel free to only respond to the ones that interest you the most.\n\n1. Could Ukraine consolidate its newer-acquired inventory to create an all-NATO-equipped unit? What would be the timeline? Would there be a reason to do this? What would the integration of this unit look like?\n\n2. What would be the economic effect globally if the war suddenly ended? Europe/America/China/OPEC in particular.\n\n3. What percentage of the time does America fight wars through proxies versus on its own? Does it make sense for American procurement to give greater (than current) extra value to weapons that can be easily transferred to proxies without too much of a burden in terms of technology risk, training requirements, and inter-compatibility with foreign stocks?\n\n4. How significant is $300 billion to Putin? What is the likelihood that these frozen assets end up back in Russia\u2019s hand as part of a peace deal? Would this be enough to change Kremlin minds about the inviolability of Crimea?\n\n5. Determining the status of the territorial reconquest is difficult because the land can be denominated as square kilometers, towns, oblasts, pre-conflict populations, defense lines etc. For example, if Russia broke through ten natural high-level defense lines during the invasion in Donetsk, and only 4 of those defense lines have been reconquered, this may suggest that 40% of the \u2018work\u2019 is done as compared to a metric based on the conquering and reconquering of enumerated towns. What is the most useful way to quantify how much was conquered, how much has been reconquered, and what remains to be reconquered when it comes to a military analysis?\n\n6. Is there any analysis of who these Russian prisoner \"volunteers\" are? What does the overall Russian prison population look like in terms of crimes, ages, region, sentence, and who among them is eligible and taking advantage of this eligibility? The coverage I have read seems very simplistic talking about \"thousands\" but then only mentioning murder and rape when I assume that to gather that number would require recruiting a lot of small-time criminals who haven't been forsaken by their families.\n\n7. What are the mechanics of the situation that would follow a hypothetical Ukrainian surprise assault and capture of Belgorod? What Russian military units shift from the current front lines inside of Ukraine and where do they go? How many Russian nuclear weapons are used and where do they strike and to what effect? Is there a pre-strike conversation between Putin and other world leaders such as Xi? What happens to Western aid?\n\n8. What is the basic outline of the escalation ladder between The West and Iran and how does it compare to the outline between The West and Russia?\n\n9. What is the intelligence / state department / etc theory behind supporting replacements for removed dictators? Does the US not believe in the efficacy of supporting a specific replacement for Putin, or does it not want to set some precedent, or something else? If Putin died tomorrow and Biden, Modi, Xi, MBS all endorsed one specific successor with implied forcefulness, what would happen? Which one of those leaders has interests too divergent from the others to be able to find a compromise choice and agree to do this?\n\n10. I have asked this before: What are the current top data visualizations (dials, livemaps, infographics, charts) that you follow for conflict coverage? Doesn't it seem like this arena could borrow heavily from the election data coverage teams? Here are some possible visualizations:\n\n\\-\tScoring table showing top conflict analysts/sources and their prediction accuracy for events\n\n\\-\tInventory and depletion charts for major weapon systems and manpower (a la u/Taw)\n\n\\-\tConflict-style \u201cbig mac index\u201d showing current loadout for average new troop for each side\n\n\\-\tNeedle/dial showing aggregate of analysts\u2019 current estimates of positive/negative outcome probabilities for major propositions\n\n\\-\tTimeline chart showing balance of favor/power for each side over time",
