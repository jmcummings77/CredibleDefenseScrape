Overall for now we have a situation of ''natural'' borders as both sides play for time, the  RSF to begin their siege and exploit the newly gained territory and army to begin their preparations for a counter offensive. Overall the worst off are the civilians as this turns one of the most fertile regions in the nation into a warzone and already caused 120,000 to flee alongside creating a new front.\n\nhttps://sudanwarmonitor.com/p/the-new-gedaref-front\n\n\nWhy did the army lose it's gains so fast? Looking through a mix of RSF boosts and the depression of the Sudanese people leadership decapitation.\n\nNow it's hard to get a accurate number of combatants for each unit in the war but the army  committed reserves based in Gedaref City, capital of Gedaref State. The 2nd Infantry Division is headquartered in this city as well as at least one battalion of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a former Darfur rebel group now allied with the Sudanese military. Give or take I think the average Sudanese army brigade is at least 2,000 strong.\n\n\nThe RSF claim to have killed around 170 fighters and captured a numbers of vehicles which seems a bit small to give up so quickly.\n\nLooking around the civilian accounts might provide a explanation.\n\n'' The Brigadier General, commander of the forces in Dinder, was captured, and if this indicates anything, it indicates that they were valiant and fought until their last breath.The Brigadier, his colleagues and his colleagues attested to his righteousness, magnanimity, and courage. He was present in the Omdurman operations in the Corps of Engineers before moving to Dinder, and any call indicating that he was a fifth column is incorrect ''\nhttps://x.com/yasseralfadol/status/1809319025559892425\n\nTook me a while to find his name.\n\n''_Brigadier General Ismail Ishaq Mansour.. _You are a disobedient Walid, neither a traitor nor a thief.. _May God break your captivity.. _And traitors are they, and God is not you...''\n\nhttps://x.com/YASIR_MOS91/status/1809382733535125650\n\n''Today, Friday, our forces achieved a sweeping victory over the Burhan militia, the brigades of the Islamic terrorist movement, and the so-called (joint forces), by liberating the strategic \u201cDindar\u201d region in Sinnar state, and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in equipment and lives.\n\nOur forces seized (9) vehicles with full military equipment, destroyed (7) vehicles, seized various weapons and ammunition, and killed more than 170 enemy forces. Our forces were able to capture a mobile commander of the Burhan militia with the rank of Brigadier General, along with the commander of the movements\u2019 mercenary force. The remaining cowards fled, wandering on their faces, pursued by shame and fear, and our forces extended their control over the entire Dinder area.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces affirm their full commitment to secure and protect civilians and work to restore basic services and operate markets and all strategic facilities, and call on citizens in Dinder and neighboring villages not to pay attention to the lies of the remnants and their mouthpieces who work to spread rumors and systematic misinformation.\n\nThe recent victories of our forces in Sennar State will pave the way for the liberation of other regions, leading to the liberation of all of Sudan from the grip of the terrorists and mercenaries, and the building of a new state based on freedom, democracy, justice, and an army that protects our land and our people.\n\nMercy and forgiveness for our righteous martyrs\nThe official spokesman for the Rapid Support Forces''\nhttps://x.com/RSFSudan/status/1809247469714436345\n\n\nGiven the reconciled rebels I believe have their own chain of command it's easy seeing how that would created further chaos and lead to the withdraw as a tactical choice.\n\nIt seems the RSF offensive continues let's hope the army can defend it.\n\n'' An attack by the Rapid Support militia on the village of Hawwa, east of the city of Dinder.''\nhttps://x.com/sudan_war/status/1809546814355349742\n\n\nOther news RSF executions continue.\n\n'' The Rapid Support Militia assassinated the imam of the Al-Dankoj Mosque, Sheikh Al-Nadhir, in the Hajar Al-Asal area, south of Shindi, after accusing him of cooperating with the Air Force, taking him from the mosque to the middle of the market, and unloading a hail of bullets on him in front of a crowd of citizens.''\n\nhttps://x.com/sudan_war/status/1809509749160882240\n\n'' The Rapid Support Militia assassinated Dr. Awad Al-Karim Al-Khair, anesthesia specialist at Royal Care Hospital, then he was working in Singa Hospital, and assassinated his brother and nephew with him.''\nhttps://x.com/sudan_war/status/1809512308319641684\n\nMy guess that case was affiliated with the resistance communities or seen as to pro army.\n\n\nInternational news section.\n\n''- Per statement by the coordinating body of Sudanese refugees in Amhara region, Khairallah Ali was abducted in a vehicle belonging to World Vision org, along w/ 2 Ethiopian women.- The women were released, but a 300,000 birr ransom was demanded for Khairallah.''\n\nhttps://x.com/BSonblast/status/1809452016009461984\n\nI believe these are Amhara militias for those unaware Amaara nationalism has been on the rise in Ethiopia and played a very big part in the war in Tigray being able to recruit tens of thousands of fighters against their ethnic enemies the Tigrayans who stole  pieces of their land during their rule and legitimisation of sectarian militias like Fano who where hostile to the Ethiopian state given their mutual enemies. Since the Tigrayans have been massacred into submission the pact ended with the state striking first trying to integrate and dissolve them, since them a war has been waged that's hard to track because of the state of emergency and media black out in the region.\n\nFano and other groups claim a part of Sudan known as Al-Fashaga which the Ethiopian state has given up on which they see as a betrayal of their people and been doing cross border attacks for years. Since the start of the war many Sudanese refuges in in both Ethiopia and the border region have been attacked and preyed upon by the groups there.\n\nIt's part of the reason why traditional parties have circled their wagons around the army so much and the former are extremely reluctant around the concept of ceasefires given how that led the partition of South Sudan free from Khartoum. The elites very much view their nation as being circled by wolves given the characters of the region. The RSF looting the capital also helped  a fair bit.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/kenya-threatens-to-sell-off-juba-bound-cargo-stuck-in-depots-4681576\n\n\nIn part because of the economic crisis present in South Sudan Kenya is threatening to sell some goods they import through them. In 2023 they imported around 1.92 million metric tonnes of cargo through Kenya. Some of the goods are pretty basic others though are pharmaceutical supplies.

Basically, they are taking the notoriously laggy (about 6 months) Probate Registry data and make various adjustments to project it into the present day. The results track well with other estimations. \n\nHere comes the interesting part. Through this new method Meduza estimates that, by the end of June, between 105,000 and 140,000 Russian soldiers have been KIA, with the most likely number being 120,000 (They estimate that, currently 200 to 250 Russian soldiers die per day).

For example: On July 1st, the Ukrainan MoD reported 543,810 Russian casualties, which falls well within the upper bound of the new Meduza numbers. My confidence in the number published by Ukraine rises. \n\nWhat I wonder about is whether this estimate includes casualties from DNR and LNR territories.

The need for the fossil fuel - specially crude - for NK is not about diesel needed to run mechanicals like tractors or farm machinery but it&#39;s about the fertilizer.  They need crude as the base for chemical fertilizer production which they need because North Korean soil is in such poor quality and without the fertilizer, yield will be way too low.  The reason they use manure - which they collect systemically with quotas for people to meet - as the substitute is b/c they just don&#39;t have enough crude to go around which is almost always since all the crude import - NK itself produces no crude - come via PRC as freebie.</p>\n</div>",

North Korea started its own espionage and stealing tech from Soviet nuclear weapon technology development since long before that, shortly after the Korean war ended. Simply because Soviet refused to give nuclear technology and North Korea was crazy about getting this technology. Wikipedia might not tell you this though.
