        "body": "[Zelensky Called Him a Criminal. Now Ukraine Calls Him for Guns and Ammo.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/12/world/europe/ukraine-arms-dealer-serhiy-pashinsky.html) From the New York Times\n\n([Archive link](https://archive.li/uoirL)) \n\nAs usual, I've left stuff out, I would strongly encourage you to read the full thing, that's why I provide the archive link. I'm just summarising as I personally see fit to, and I am ultimately governed by the character limit (I am 400 short of maxxing out here).\n\n> In the early weeks of the war in Ukraine, with the invading Russian Army bearing down on Kyiv, the Ukrainian government needed weapons, and quickly. So its Ministry of Defense made a desperate and unlikely phone call.\n\n> On the other end of the line was Serhiy Pashinsky, a chain-smoking former lawmaker who had overseen military spending for years. He had spent much of that under investigation on suspicion of corruption or denying accusations of self-dealing. Now, he was living in virtual political exile at his country estate, sidelined by President Volodymyr Zelensky and his promise to root out corruption.\n\u201cGo out on the streets and ask whether Pashinsky is a criminal,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said on national television in 2019. \u201cI guarantee you that out of 100 people, 100 will say that he is a criminal.\u201d\n\n>But Mr. Pashinsky had ties to the arms business and, perhaps as important, he knew how to operate in a scrum, undaunted by red tape. In government, that had made him the source of scandal. During wartime, it made him invaluable.\n\n> He answered the call.\n\n> Eighteen months later, a New York Times investigation found, a company tied to Mr. Pashinsky has become the biggest private arms supplier in Ukraine. It buys and sells grenades, artillery shells and rockets through a trans-European network of middlemen. The company, Ukrainian Armored Technology, reported its best year ever last year, with sales totaling more than $350 million, up from $2.8 million the year before the war.\n\n> And Mr. Pashinsky is once again under investigation, with the Ukrainian authorities scrutinizing Ukrainian Armored Technology\u2019s pricing and his financial relationships with procurement officials and companies abroad, said two officials familiar with the matter.\n\n> Mr. Pashinsky and the arms network he built highlight a little-discussed aspect of Ukraine\u2019s war strategy. In the name of rushing weapons to the front line, leaders have resurrected figures from Ukraine\u2019s rough-and-tumble past and undone, at least temporarily, years of anticorruption policies. Government officials stopped blacklisting suppliers who had ripped off the military, and they abandoned many public-disclosure rules intended to reveal self-dealing.\n\n> In the immediate term, the gamble is paying off. Ukraine held off Russian troops long enough for international aid to arrive. And Ukrainian Armored Technology has tens of millions of dollars in ongoing contracts to support the war effort. The long-term risk is that these temporary changes become entrenched, and that Mr. Pashinsky and others who had been sidelined will emerge from the war with more money and influence than ever.\nUkrainian leaders understand this risk. \u201cWe are not very idealistic in this regard,\u201d the deputy defense minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, said in an interview. When the war broke out, he said, \u201cwe wanted huge amounts, immediately.\u201d\n\n> A Times investigation across Europe shows how that happened, and how Ukraine\u2019s policies, born out of desperation, drove up prices and added layer upon layer of profit-making.\nMr. Pashinsky\u2019s network, for example, buys weapons and then sells them, then buys them again and sells them once more, according to classified contracts and government documents obtained by The Times, along with interviews of more than two dozen current and former government officials and arms-industry figures.\nWith each transaction, prices rise \u2014 as do the profits of Mr. Pashinsky\u2019s associates \u2014 until the final buyer, Ukraine\u2019s military, pays the most. Using multiple brokers in this way may be legal, but it is a time-tested way to inflate profits, and something the Pentagon avoids.\n\n> Much of the money that fuels this system comes from European aid, according to an official with knowledge of Ukraine\u2019s wartime funding. But European and American officials are loath to discuss Mr. Pashinsky, for fear of playing into Russia\u2019s narrative that Ukraine\u2019s government is hopelessly corrupt and must be replaced.\nPrivately, though, they say the re-emergence of figures like Mr. Pashinsky is one reason the American and British governments are buying ammunition for Ukraine rather than simply handing over money.\n\n> Mr. Pashinsky denied negotiating such deals and chalked up his years of scandals to Russian disinformation campaigns. \u201cI have never been and never will be an embodiment or symbol of a corrupt system,\u201d he said.\nHe acknowledged the ongoing criminal investigation but said it was motivated by a misguided notion among government officials that arms sellers are making unfairly high profits. He called himself \u201ca responsible citizen of my country who has never betrayed it and will never betray it.\u201d\nAs for Mr. Zelensky\u2019s televised remarks years back, \u201cThe president simply made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is also a fallible human being.\u201d\nMr. Pashinsky\u2019s detractors say he\u2019s a profiteer. Good-governance groups and political adversaries bemoan his resurgence. But even they are nearly unanimous that today\u2019s weapons-at-any-cost environment is perfect for Mr. Pashinsky.\nAnd he\u2019s delivering.\n\n> Voters ousted Mr. Pashinsky from Parliament in 2019, the same year that Mr. Zelensky rode into office promising to get serious about corruption.\nAlmost immediately, Mr. Pashinsky\u2019s air of invincibility was gone.\nThe country\u2019s anticorruption bureau began investigating him on accusations of \u201cabuse of official position,\u201d court records provided by the Ukrainian data company YouControl show. Detectives raided his house at 7 a.m. on Feb. 24, 2020, Mr. Pashinsky wrote on Facebook. The military stopped awarding significant business to Ukrainian Armored Technology, and anticorruption investigators raided its office, confiscating documents and a hard drive.\n\n> And soon after the new president came into power, Mr. Pashinsky was arrested over a three-year-old road-rage episode. Mr. Pashinsky had stepped out of his car and fired a gun into the air. When the other driver responded by hitting him in the head with a bottle, he said, \u201cI was forced to shoot him in the leg.\u201d A judge temporarily put him under house arrest in a case that is still pending.\n\n> With Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border in January 2022, Mr. Pashinsky saw an opportunity. War seemed imminent, and Ukraine had an arms shortage.\nUkraine had made few major arms purchases in the prior 18 months.\nMr. Zelensky\u2019s policy overhauls had made procurement more transparent, it seemed, but also less effective. The old system was gone, but nobody could figure out a new one.\nMr. Pashinsky began telling military contacts that, if asked, he could supply weapons, government officials said.\nThat\u2019s when the phone rang and he was invited to a meeting with defense officials, according to four people briefed on it.\nBig NATO shipments had yet to begin, and the country desperately needed Soviet-caliber ammunition. The most important supplier, Bulgaria, refused to sell directly to Ukraine for fear of upsetting Russia.\n\n> Since Bulgaria did not allow ammunition sales directly to Ukraine, Ukrainian Armored Technology made a deal with a 70-year-old Polish middleman, Andrzej Kowalczyk. He got paperwork falsely listing Poland, not Ukraine, as the ultimate buyer, deal documents show.\nRecords show that weapons went from Bulgarian manufacturers to Mr. Stanislavov; then to the Polish middleman; then to Ukrainian Armored Technology; and finally to Ukraine\u2019s military. Shipping records for one deal show that a Ukrainian airline flew 265,000 pounds of rockets, grenades and shells from Bulgaria to Poland for delivery to Ukraine.\nWith each step, prices increased, Mr. Stanislavov acknowledged in a brief interview. The Polish middleman, for example, takes a cut. \u201cIt has some surplus of profit,\u201d Mr. Stanislavov said. \u201cOf course. Because it\u2019s a company.\u201d Mr. Kowalczyk said his company takes only a small profit on such deals.\nThese price increases can benefit Ukrainian Armored Technology, because it charges the Ukrainian military fees based on its purchase price.\nUkrainian prosecutors are now investigating this network and whether Mr. Pashinsky got kickbacks from the Polish middleman, according to an official with knowledge of the inquiry. Mr. Pashinsky said that he knew the man, but that they had no financial relationship.\n\nI appreciate that the last few articles I've posted here have been more... pessimistic. I'm genuinely not happy about that, it's just that I usually find the more positive ones after everyone else has already posted them. I think this one is balanced out specifically by the point that he is under investigation *now*, signalling that this really was more of a \"throw everything at the wall\" deal and that they're likely going to clamp down now there's actual breathing room. And it's not anything particularly *unique*, the US famously did it with Operation Underworld in WW2. Ultimately, as unhappy as I am to seem to only ever contribute negative stuff, *someone* has to do it, and hopefully I will have better stuff in future. Also the detail about him shooting a guy in the leg and claiming he had no other choice is just too buck wild.",

The company, Ukrainian Armored Technology, reported its best year ever last year, with sales totaling more than $350 million, up from $2.8 million the year before the war.</p>\n\n<p>And Mr. Pashinsky is once again under investigation, with the Ukrainian authorities scrutinizing Ukrainian Armored Technology\u2019s pricing and his financial relationships with procurement officials and companies abroad, said two officials familiar with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Pashinsky and the arms network he built highlight a little-discussed aspect of Ukraine\u2019s war strategy. In the name of rushing weapons to the front line, leaders have resurrected figures from Ukraine\u2019s rough-and-tumble past and undone, at least temporarily, years of anticorruption policies. Government officials stopped blacklisting suppliers who had ripped off the military, and they abandoned many public-disclosure rules intended to reveal self-dealing.</p>\n\n<p>In the immediate term, the gamble is paying off. Ukraine held off Russian troops long enough for international aid to arrive. And Ukrainian Armored Technology has tens of millions of dollars in ongoing contracts to support the war effort. The long-term risk is that these temporary changes become entrenched, and that Mr. Pashinsky and others who had been sidelined will emerge from the war with more money and influence than ever.\nUkrainian leaders understand this risk. \u201cWe are not very idealistic in this regard,\u201d the deputy defense minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, said in an interview. When the war broke out, he said, \u201cwe wanted huge amounts, immediately.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A Times investigation across Europe shows how that happened, and how Ukraine\u2019s policies, born out of desperation, drove up prices and added layer upon layer of profit-making.\nMr. Pashinsky\u2019s network, for example, buys weapons and then sells them, then buys them again and sells them once more, according to classified contracts and government documents obtained by The Times, along with interviews of more than two dozen current and former government officials and arms-industry figures.\nWith each transaction, prices rise \u2014 as do the profits of Mr. Pashinsky\u2019s associates \u2014 until the final buyer, Ukraine\u2019s military, pays the most. Using multiple brokers in this way may be legal, but it is a time-tested way to inflate profits, and something the Pentagon avoids.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the money that fuels this system comes from European aid, according to an official with knowledge of Ukraine\u2019s wartime funding. But European and American officials are loath to discuss Mr. Pashinsky, for fear of playing into Russia\u2019s narrative that Ukraine\u2019s government is hopelessly corrupt and must be replaced.\nPrivately, though, they say the re-emergence of figures like Mr. Pashinsky is one reason the American and British governments are buying ammunition for Ukraine rather than simply handing over money.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Pashinsky denied negotiating such deals and chalked up his years of scandals to Russian disinformation campaigns. \u201cI have never been and never will be an embodiment or symbol of a corrupt system,\u201d he said.\nHe acknowledged the ongoing criminal investigation but said it was motivated by a misguided notion among government officials that arms sellers are making unfairly high profits. He called himself \u201ca responsible citizen of my country who has never betrayed it and will never betray it.\u201d\nAs for Mr. Zelensky\u2019s televised remarks years back, \u201cThe president simply made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is also a fallible human being.\u201d\nMr. Pashinsky\u2019s detractors say he\u2019s a profiteer. Good-governance groups and political adversaries bemoan his resurgence. But even they are nearly unanimous that today\u2019s weapons-at-any-cost environment is perfect for Mr. Pashinsky.\nAnd he\u2019s delivering.</p>\n\n<p>Voters ousted Mr. Pashinsky from Parliament in 2019, the same year that Mr. Zelensky rode into office promising to get serious about corruption.\nAlmost immediately, Mr. Pashinsky\u2019s air of invincibility was gone.\nThe country\u2019s anticorruption bureau began investigating him on accusations of \u201cabuse of official position,\u201d court records provided by the Ukrainian data company YouControl show. Detectives raided his house at 7 a.m. on Feb. 24, 2020, Mr. Pashinsky wrote on Facebook. The military stopped awarding significant business to Ukrainian Armored Technology, and anticorruption investigators raided its office, confiscating documents and a hard drive.</p>\n\n<p>And soon after the new president came into power, Mr. Pashinsky was arrested over a three-year-old road-rage episode. Mr. Pashinsky had stepped out of his car and fired a gun into the air. When the other driver responded by hitting him in the head with a bottle, he said, \u201cI was forced to shoot him in the leg.\u201d A judge temporarily put him under house arrest in a case that is still pending.</p>\n\n<p>With Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border in January 2022, Mr. Pashinsky saw an opportunity. War seemed imminent, and Ukraine had an arms shortage.\nUkraine had made few major arms purchases in the prior 18 months.\nMr. Zelensky\u2019s policy overhauls had made procurement more transparent, it seemed, but also less effective. The old system was gone, but nobody could figure out a new one.\nMr. Pashinsky began telling military contacts that, if asked, he could supply weapons, government officials said.\nThat\u2019s when the phone rang and he was invited to a meeting with defense officials, according to four people briefed on it.\nBig NATO shipments had yet to begin, and the country desperately needed Soviet-caliber ammunition. The most important supplier, Bulgaria, refused to sell directly to Ukraine for fear of upsetting Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Since Bulgaria did not allow ammunition sales directly to Ukraine, Ukrainian Armored Technology made a deal with a 70-year-old Polish middleman, Andrzej Kowalczyk. He got paperwork falsely listing Poland, not Ukraine, as the ultimate buyer, deal documents show.\nRecords show that weapons went from Bulgarian manufacturers to Mr. Stanislavov; then to the Polish middleman; then to Ukrainian Armored Technology; and finally to Ukraine\u2019s military. Shipping records for one deal show that a Ukrainian airline flew 265,000 pounds of rockets, grenades and shells from Bulgaria to Poland for delivery to Ukraine.\nWith each step, prices increased, Mr. Stanislavov acknowledged in a brief interview. The Polish middleman, for example, takes a cut. \u201cIt has some surplus of profit,\u201d Mr. Stanislavov said. \u201cOf course. Because it\u2019s a company.\u201d Mr. Kowalczyk said his company takes only a small profit on such deals.\nThese price increases can benefit Ukrainian Armored Technology, because it charges the Ukrainian military fees based on its purchase price.\nUkrainian prosecutors are now investigating this network and whether Mr. Pashinsky got kickbacks from the Polish middleman, according to an official with knowledge of the inquiry. Mr. Pashinsky said that he knew the man, but that they had no financial relationship.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I appreciate that the last few articles I&#39;ve posted here have been more... pessimistic. I&#39;m genuinely not happy about that, it&#39;s just that I usually find the more positive ones after everyone else has already posted them. I think this one is balanced out specifically by the point that he is under investigation <em>now</em>, signalling that this really was more of a &quot;throw everything at the wall&quot; deal and that they&#39;re likely going to clamp down now there&#39;s actual breathing room. And it&#39;s not anything particularly <em>unique</em>, the US famously did it with Operation Underworld in WW2. Ultimately, as unhappy as I am to seem to only ever contribute negative stuff, <em>someone</em> has to do it, and hopefully I will have better stuff in future. Also the detail about him shooting a guy in the leg and claiming he had no other choice is just too buck wild.</p>\n</div>",

Random highlights:\n\n\\- Phil and Gen. Wesley Clarke (not in the video but somewhere cooking up ways to get Ukrainians over the minefield. One of the rare famous-ish US general who isn't on CNN on the regular) are trying their best impersonation of Zhukov with regards to minefields. \"If we come to a minefield, our infantry attacks exactly as it were not there.\" Zhukov. OK, the reality may have been [a bit more complex](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6rabb3/did_the_soviets_really_send_their_infantry/); well, the Russians' reputation took a hit after 24th Feb 2022 so these days it may be that \"hehe, they definitely just charged over the minefields\". Still, Phil and Clarke were thinking of schemes like \"Vismod 30 or so vehicles, tractors, junk cars and tanks to look like Bradleys, Leos, etc ..., give it remote-controlled capability with just basic steering and just drive forward over the minefield absorbing mines, ATGMs and artillery. Just drive a brigade with 120 vehicles over the minefield following it. If you lose 60, it may just be worth it to get to the MDL. Otherwise the engineers and sappers got stuck trying to clear the minefields and get hit by IDF\".\n\n\\- \"Why not F-16 Flying Tigers?\"\n\n\\- Value of the F-16s, if the Ukrainians can get them: Russian air and GBAD cooperation involves areas over which there are active missions, the GBADs fire only on positive identification and IFF. In other areas, without active Russian missions, the GBAD can have free fire. F-16s can heavily interfere with this and forces Russian air to drop bombs, one pass, haul ass, reducing their effectiveness.\n\n\\- How to deal with drones, in the medium-long term. There have been technologies that uses lasers to detect the presence of a camera or a scope. It will ignore a single pane of glass but when the object has two lens, it can be clearly identified. Then the lasers can be increased in power to fry the photo receptors. Or the eyeballs behind the scope (which is prohibited). Since drones still have to use cameras these can be used and aimed upwards.\n\n\\- Anecdote of the Obama admin fucking with Ukraine wrt to supplying help. UKR: \"we need counterbattery radar for artillery\". Obama admin gave mortar counterbattery radar, without software or cables. the UKR made it work anyway, used it to detect drones, made it usable as artillery counterbattery radar.\n\n\\- Overall, a lot of annoyances at what Phil called \"prevarications\" when it comes to aiding Ukraine but also some defence of the US's reluctance. The US is the only nuclear-armed NATO member who puts their cities at risk for another state's city.\n\n\\- \"How to deal with Hungary in NATO\", coke-fiend edition: \"disband NATO on Monday, reform NATO 2.0 minus Hungary on Tuesday\".\n\n\\- \"We can't have Ukraine in NATO while i still has an active war\". That just incentivises Putin to keep the shooting war shooting forever. OK. Also. during the Cold War, West Germany was the founding member of NATO with one-third of Germany under occupation and 5 armies aimed at it; sounded like a war. OK.\n\n(The Europeans are real free-riders in NATO)\n\n\\- Watch out for Blinken's \"Russia has already lost\" statement. It may just mean that \"whatever happens from now is acceptable to the US\". Including a negotiated settlement that ends the war that is unfavourable to Ukraine. Interesting, because I've heard Lawrence Wilkerson suggested that right now, Biden is tied to saying that he will support Ukraine to the hilt or he will be screwed in the 2024 election. After the election, though ....  Now, Wilkerson is with the Quincy institute so that is understandable.\n\n\\- Phil is really, really empathetic to Ukraine. Forget casualty trade ratio: \"in the first year of the war, Ukraine lost a year's worth of GDP. The best estimate for recovery is 10% growth per year. If the war goes on for 2 years, it will take the UKR 20 years to get back to the level just before the war\". Now add on all the dead Ukrainians on top.

                        "body": "Russian Naval Infantry is basically used in the same way as VDV - to provide troops competent enough to be exploited for counterattacks or particularly hostile battles. It's also less autonomous compared to VDV, and dependent on the Armies to which the various naval infantry brigades are attached, whereas the VDV operates more as a separate Corps regardless of the sectors in which they are deployed, afaik.\n\nWe need to consider two things: naval infantry brigades are small in size. For example, the 336th Brigade (that is in the second line in the Velyka Novosilka sector and at the moment it's still fresh) in peacetime consisted of about 1500 men, now pretty surely more having received Storm Z units though. \n\nAt the same time, Vuhledar is always associated with the 155th NIB and to a lesser extent with the 40th, but of course they weren't alone there and only part of the losses sustained during the two failed attacks in November and especially February are theirs. Elements of the 36th and 29th Armies, as well as the 3rd Corps, were certainly involved. By Mediazona's figures the Russian marines had more casualties in November than in February in fact. In general naval infantry and VDV surely had very heavy losses during the conflict, but not to the point of ceasing to exist as operational formations. \n\nAfaik the losses were replenished with the mobilized, but probably the better quality ones, such as those who had served there in the past. The Russian Army at the front today consists largely of mobilized men. The quality of these varies greatly. You have the former paratroopers in the VDV, a good part of the personnel of the 42nd Motorized Division are mobilized too as far as I read, yet they are having a good perfomance. Then you have the mobilized from the territorial regiments who are pretty bad in terms of capabilities.\n\nAs for Novodonetske, as far as we know, it should be the border between the sectors of the 37th MRB and 40th NIB... The former stretches from Novodonetske to Urozhaine while the latter is concentrated around Novomaiorske and extends from Urozhaine to the Vuhledar sector. The 155th NIB on the other hand was always in Vuhledar along with (the rest of) the 29th Army, I find it very interesting that detachments from this brigade were deployed in Urozhaine. Probably, according to what the Ukrainians say, elements from this brigade are used as a \"fire fighters\" to be sent to the most difficult directions between Velyka Novosilka and Vuhledar. According to what I have read, they exploited the convicts of Storm Z for the urban battle of the last week and then used squads of regular marines to cover the retreat of other units such as the Cascade and Vostok Battalions and perhaps elements of the 60th MRB. \n\nThe controversy of the last days was that Khodakovsky and the \"Military Informant\" Telegram channel accused the 37th Brigade of failing to intervene in defense of Urozhaine and having a part of its personnel drunk in the rear. The latter also doubled down by saying that: the 37th Brigade allegedly ran from its areas of responsibility around Urozhaine; Ukrainian gear captured in the area (e.g. AMX-10RC) would actually be the marines' work for which the 37th took credit; that this brigade was very seriously at fault for having lost territory captured by marines around Vuhledar back in the autumn/winter. Recall that the 36th Army, of which the 37th MRB and 5th TB are part, wants to retain the latter brigade for the defense of Kermenchyk. \"Voin_dv\" which is a Telegram channel close to the Eastern Mlitary District dismissed the accusations, saying that the Pacific Fleet marines have nothing to recriminate to the 37th Brigade and accusing the DPR-related units of wanting to shift the blame to others (even though the channel acknowledged that the latters fought well).\n\nFor everything else, I totally agree! Russian strategy has been based since April 2022 on the combined use of expendable personnel + regulars if not elite units. Who is better suited to defend a village maybe considered already lost and under heavy Ukrainian artillery fire than Storm Z? Their goal with these desperate defenses is to bleed as many Ukrainian personnel as possible. These defenses are still done quite reasonably anyway, though - for instance they still retreat before risking of finding themselves surrounded.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Russian Naval Infantry is basically used in the same way as VDV - to provide troops competent enough to be exploited for counterattacks or particularly hostile battles. It&#39;s also less autonomous compared to VDV, and dependent on the Armies to which the various naval infantry brigades are attached, whereas the VDV operates more as a separate Corps regardless of the sectors in which they are deployed, afaik.</p>\n\n<p>We need to consider two things: naval infantry brigades are small in size. For example, the 336th Brigade (that is in the second line in the Velyka Novosilka sector and at the moment it&#39;s still fresh) in peacetime consisted of about 1500 men, now pretty surely more having received Storm Z units though. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Vuhledar is always associated with the 155th NIB and to a lesser extent with the 40th, but of course they weren&#39;t alone there and only part of the losses sustained during the two failed attacks in November and especially February are theirs. Elements of the 36th and 29th Armies, as well as the 3rd Corps, were certainly involved. By Mediazona&#39;s figures the Russian marines had more casualties in November than in February in fact. In general naval infantry and VDV surely had very heavy losses during the conflict, but not to the point of ceasing to exist as operational formations. </p>\n\n<p>Afaik the losses were replenished with the mobilized, but probably the better quality ones, such as those who had served there in the past. The Russian Army at the front today consists largely of mobilized men. The quality of these varies greatly. You have the former paratroopers in the VDV, a good part of the personnel of the 42nd Motorized Division are mobilized too as far as I read, yet they are having a good perfomance. Then you have the mobilized from the territorial regiments who are pretty bad in terms of capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>As for Novodonetske, as far as we know, it should be the border between the sectors of the 37th MRB and 40th NIB... The former stretches from Novodonetske to Urozhaine while the latter is concentrated around Novomaiorske and extends from Urozhaine to the Vuhledar sector. The 155th NIB on the other hand was always in Vuhledar along with (the rest of) the 29th Army, I find it very interesting that detachments from this brigade were deployed in Urozhaine. Probably, according to what the Ukrainians say, elements from this brigade are used as a &quot;fire fighters&quot; to be sent to the most difficult directions between Velyka Novosilka and Vuhledar. According to what I have read, they exploited the convicts of Storm Z for the urban battle of the last week and then used squads of regular marines to cover the retreat of other units such as the Cascade and Vostok Battalions and perhaps elements of the 60th MRB. </p>\n\n<p>The controversy of the last days was that Khodakovsky and the &quot;Military Informant&quot; Telegram channel accused the 37th Brigade of failing to intervene in defense of Urozhaine and having a part of its personnel drunk in the rear. The latter also doubled down by saying that: the 37th Brigade allegedly ran from its areas of responsibility around Urozhaine; Ukrainian gear captured in the area (e.g. AMX-10RC) would actually be the marines&#39; work for which the 37th took credit; that this brigade was very seriously at fault for having lost territory captured by marines around Vuhledar back in the autumn/winter.

Apple is the largest company by capitalization, in the top 10 by revenue, and has absolutely massive cash reserves. iPhone sales remain above 200 million units per year. As for innovating? They were able to stealth develop an in house ARM processor that's the fastest in the world on a per cycle basis and is shockingly low power. I'm typing on one right now and can tell you it's the best laptop I've ever had by a huge margin. It's amazing.\n\nLook I'm not an Apple fan boy but I work in tech, have friends at Apple, etc. Saying Apple is a company at risk is absurd.\n\nNVIDIA is the one that looks more at risk frankly. They've had a lock on the datacenter GPU market for quite some time now, but that's shifting. CUDA is no longer the moat it once was as machine learning frameworks have moved up to higher level representations of models. Additionally big tech is sick of paying the NVIDIA tax which is why they've been developing their own tensor processors as a superior alternative.\n\nAs a company they're in fine shape, but they likely won't enjoy quite the same dominance going forward.",

The US economy is dominated by services not manufacturing now, and rising living standards in middle income countries creates opportunities. The US still has substantial advantages as well. For example, many have tried to duplicate Silicon Valley, but none have come close to displacing it. The US continues to define the cutting edge in aerospace, etc.</p>\n</div>",

Silk's job is to provide cover from Russian air-to-air missiles. But there is not much Ukrainian jets can do to stop them.\n\n>\"Our biggest enemy is Russian Su-35 fighter jets,\" says another MiG-29 pilot with the call sign Juice.\n\n>\"We know positions of [Russian] air defence, we know their ranges. It's quite predictable, so we can calculate how long we can stay [inside their zone]. But in the case of fighter jets, they are mobile. They have a good air picture and they know when we're flying to the front lines.\"\n\n>Russian air patrols can detect a jet's take-off deep inside the territory of Ukraine. Their R-37M missiles can hit an aerial target at a distance of 150-200km (93-124 miles), whereas Ukrainian rockets can only travel up to 50km (31 miles).\n\n>So, Russian planes can see Ukrainian aircraft and shoot them down long before they pose any threat.\n\n>Since the start of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian Air Force has suffered serious losses - although they don't reveal specific figures.\n\n>Russia's claim that they've destroyed more than 400 Ukrainian planes doesn't seem plausible, given independent estimates of the Ukrainian fleet's size are at least half that number.\n\n>The IISS Military Balance 2022 report states that the Ukrainian Air Force had 124 combat-capable aircraft before the full-scale Russian invasion.\n\n>To end Russia's superiority in the air, Ukraine wants its Western partners to provide more modern jets like the US-made F-16.\n\n>\"Our pilots fly on a knife's edge,\" says Col Volodymyr Lohachov, the head of aviation development department of the Ukrainian Air Force. \"But F-16 jets would allow us to operate beyond the enemy's air defence systems.\"\n\n>And their missiles can be effective up to 150km, which will enable them to attack Russian jets as well.\n\n>\"Of course, we will still be targeted,\" says Juice. \"But it will be an equal fight. Right now, we don't have any response to them.\"\n\n>F-16s have better radars that can detect missiles fired at them. Currently, the team that monitors ground radars must verbally communicate with pilots about threats they face.\n\n>\"Our jets don't have a system to warn about [Russian rocket] launches,\" says a pilot of an Su-25 attack jet with the call sign Pumba. \"It's all visual-based. If you see them, then you just try to escape by firing off heat traps and manoeuvring.\"\n\n>Russia's air superiority means that Ukraine can afford only a limited deployment of its military aviation close to the front line, which can have a major impact on the success of any future counter-offensive operations. According to Juice, they carry out up to 20 times fewer sorties than the Russian Air Force.\n\n>And the weapons Ukrainian attack aircraft have are from the stock of old Soviet-era bombs and unguided rockets, which are quickly depleting because of limited supplies.\n\n>But it's not just air support for ground troops. Western jets can also enhance Ukraine's air defence systems, aviators say.\n\n>\"Our aircraft have old radars that don't see [Russian] cruise missiles. We are like blind cats when we try to shoot them down,\" Col Lohachov explains.\n\n>The range of western weapons on F-16s will allow them to intercept cruise missiles \"on long distances right on our borders, instead of trying to catch them somewhere in central parts of Ukraine,\" says Juice.\n\nThis has nothing to do with dog fighting. It's about avionics, radar, RWR, and BVR capability. Your statements about never being in range are demonstrably not an accurate reflection of the air war over Ukraine. I highly suggest some of the RUSI reports that have come out for more background. Here's what RUSI concluded:\n\n>The Ukrainian Air Force fighter force needs modern Western fighters and missiles to sustainably counter the VKS.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s what the Ukrainians want them for:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65461405\">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65461405</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fighter jets like the one flown by Silk accompany Ukrainian ground attack aircraft during their combat missions at the front line. Silk&#39;s job is to provide cover from Russian air-to-air missiles. But there is not much Ukrainian jets can do to stop them.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Our biggest enemy is Russian Su-35 fighter jets,&quot; says another MiG-29 pilot with the call sign Juice.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We know positions of [Russian] air defence, we know their ranges. It&#39;s quite predictable, so we can calculate how long we can stay [inside their zone]. But in the case of fighter jets, they are mobile. They have a good air picture and they know when we&#39;re flying to the front lines.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Russian air patrols can detect a jet&#39;s take-off deep inside the territory of Ukraine. Their R-37M missiles can hit an aerial target at a distance of 150-200km (93-124 miles), whereas Ukrainian rockets can only travel up to 50km (31 miles).</p>\n\n<p>So, Russian planes can see Ukrainian aircraft and shoot them down long before they pose any threat.</p>\n\n<p>Since the start of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian Air Force has suffered serious losses - although they don&#39;t reveal specific figures.</p>\n\n<p>Russia&#39;s claim that they&#39;ve destroyed more than 400 Ukrainian planes doesn&#39;t seem plausible, given independent estimates of the Ukrainian fleet&#39;s size are at least half that number.</p>\n\n<p>The IISS Military Balance 2022 report states that the Ukrainian Air Force had 124 combat-capable aircraft before the full-scale Russian invasion.</p>\n\n<p>To end Russia&#39;s superiority in the air, Ukraine wants its Western partners to provide more modern jets like the US-made F-16.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Our pilots fly on a knife&#39;s edge,&quot; says Col Volodymyr Lohachov, the head of aviation development department of the Ukrainian Air Force. &quot;But F-16 jets would allow us to operate beyond the enemy&#39;s air defence systems.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And their missiles can be effective up to 150km, which will enable them to attack Russian jets as well.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course, we will still be targeted,&quot; says Juice. &quot;But it will be an equal fight. Right now, we don&#39;t have any response to them.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>F-16s have better radars that can detect missiles fired at them. Currently, the team that monitors ground radars must verbally communicate with pilots about threats they face.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Our jets don&#39;t have a system to warn about [Russian rocket] launches,&quot; says a pilot of an Su-25 attack jet with the call sign Pumba. &quot;It&#39;s all visual-based. If you see them, then you just try to escape by firing off heat traps and manoeuvring.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Russia&#39;s air superiority means that Ukraine can afford only a limited deployment of its military aviation close to the front line, which can have a major impact on the success of any future counter-offensive operations. According to Juice, they carry out up to 20 times fewer sorties than the Russian Air Force.</p>\n\n<p>And the weapons Ukrainian attack aircraft have are from the stock of old Soviet-era bombs and unguided rockets, which are quickly depleting because of limited supplies.</p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s not just air support for ground troops. Western jets can also enhance Ukraine&#39;s air defence systems, aviators say.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Our aircraft have old radars that don&#39;t see [Russian] cruise missiles. We are like blind cats when we try to shoot them down,&quot; Col Lohachov explains.</p>\n\n<p>The range of western weapons on F-16s will allow them to intercept cruise missiles &quot;on long distances right on our borders, instead of trying to catch them somewhere in central parts of Ukraine,&quot; says Juice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has nothing to do with dog fighting. It&#39;s about avionics, radar, RWR, and BVR capability. Your statements about never being in range are demonstrably not an accurate reflection of the air war over Ukraine. I highly suggest some of the RUSI reports that have come out for more background. Here&#39;s what RUSI concluded:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Ukrainian Air Force fighter force needs modern Western fighters and missiles to sustainably counter the VKS. Russian pilots have been cautious throughout the war, so even a small number of Western fighters could have a major deterrent effect.</p>\n\n<p>As such, any new fighter for the Ukrainian Air Force needs to come equipped with a missile capable of offering the greatest possible effective range under low-altitude, subsonic launch conditions. Electronic warfare capabilities to reduce the effectiveness of Russian radars at longer ranges would also be highly beneficial, as would a radar designed to be resilient against the Khibny jamming pods that Russian fighters typically fly with over Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/russian-air-war-and-ukrainian-requirements-air-defence\">https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/russian-air-war-and-ukrainian-requirements-air-defence</a></p>\n</div>",

Please find me a source of a Russian aircraft moving out beyond the frontlines into Ukrainian space proper, because I haven't seen any example of this.

In turn, their missiles are at a disadvantage compared to Aircraft AA missiles in that they have to climb from 0 speed and altitude, but they make up by sporting larger missiles with more fuel in sizes that no normal fighter-bomber can sport.\n\nSo pray tell me, in what scenario do you envisage *a pilot being asked to take on Su-35s with an F-16A*?
