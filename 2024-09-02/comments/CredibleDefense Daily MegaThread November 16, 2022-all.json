                        "body": "I would recommend the work of Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes who wrote sever very good books synergizing Venona with Russian documents gained as a result of a defection shortly after the end of the Cold War. Their book *Spies*, for example reexamines things such as the Rosenberg trial in the context of these documents. Oppenheimer was another. \n\nRe: McCarthy, their work demonstrates that the FBI already had a very good idea of who in the government had been compromised by Soviet assets. These people had been identified as early as WWII but had been allowed to operate. Between 1945 and 1946 these people were removed, and by the time McCarthy got up with his list of spies in the government, there were none. Because the FBI had removed them. Because US counter intelligence had a *very strong* understanding of Soviet operations in the US. HUAC and what it did later didn\u2019t discover anything new, rather it just drug activists through the mud for political reasons. And we know that the activists were just activists, because while the CPUSA was heavily compromised with Russian agents, the FBI had the CPUSAs reports back to Moscow as well as Moscows directives to the CPUSA. Which included the 1944 order, repeated in 1948, ordering the CPUSA to removed non-Moscow aligned members and then dominate activist organizations by pushing out non-CPUSA members. If you want to know why the CPUSA went from being very popular in the 1930s to a nonentity after 1945, a large part of that is how they purged themself during the war, and then purged labor organization afterwards. Pissed a lot of people off. An important coda to that is through the 1950s, after the failure of an election subversion attempt in 1948, GRU and the KGB focused on *military* espionage rather than political. They wanted to steal tech, not prepare the US for revolution.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I would recommend the work of Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes who wrote sever very good books synergizing Venona with Russian documents gained as a result of a defection shortly after the end of the Cold War. Their book <em>Spies</em>, for example reexamines things such as the Rosenberg trial in the context of these documents. Oppenheimer was another. </p>\n\n<p>Re: McCarthy, their work demonstrates that the FBI already had a very good idea of who in the government had been compromised by Soviet assets. These people had been identified as early as WWII but had been allowed to operate. Between 1945 and 1946 these people were removed, and by the time McCarthy got up with his list of spies in the government, there were none. Because the FBI had removed them. Because US counter intelligence had a <em>very strong</em> understanding of Soviet operations in the US. HUAC and what it did later didn\u2019t discover anything new, rather it just drug activists through the mud for political reasons. And we know that the activists were just activists, because while the CPUSA was heavily compromised with Russian agents, the FBI had the CPUSAs reports back to Moscow as well as Moscows directives to the CPUSA. Which included the 1944 order, repeated in 1948, ordering the CPUSA to removed non-Moscow aligned members and then dominate activist organizations by pushing out non-CPUSA members. If you want to know why the CPUSA went from being very popular in the 1930s to a nonentity after 1945, a large part of that is how they purged themself during the war, and then purged labor organization afterwards. Pissed a lot of people off. An important coda to that is through the 1950s, after the failure of an election subversion attempt in 1948, GRU and the KGB focused on <em>military</em> espionage rather than political. They wanted to steal tech, not prepare the US for revolution.

I learned a ton, interestingly he recommends the Gripen if Ukraine needs aircraft before the war is over as Ukraine must use short rough runways and move the equipment and planes constantly.\n\nHeres a reading link to it: [https://t.co/NWkOx89Hql](https://t.co/NWkOx89Hql)\n\nI followed Justin on twitter, great insight and he is quite passionate about it\n\nHere's the video for anyone that wants to learn about the air war: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYDnspMWdaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYDnspMWdaM)\n\nThe following is just copy pasta from the link above:\n\n>Executive Summary\n\nRussian Aerospace Forces (VKS) conducted significantly more extensive fixed-wing strike operations during the first days of the invasion than has been previously documented, while Ukrainian ground-based air-defence (GBAD) capabilities were suppressed by initial attacks.\n\nDuring this period, Ukrainian fighter aircraft inflicted some losses on VKS aircraft but also took serious casualties due to being totally technologically outmatched and badly outnumbered.\n\nRussian fighters have remained highly effective and lethal against Ukrainian aircraft near the frontlines throughout the war, especially the Su-35S with the R-77-1 long-range missile and, in recent months, the Mig-31BM with the R-37 very long-range missile.\n\nFrom early March, the VKS lost the ability to operate in Ukrainian-controlled airspace except at very low altitudes due to its inability to reliably suppress or destroy increasingly effective, well-dispersed and mobile Ukrainian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems.\n\nRussian GBAD has also been highly effective since March, especially the long-range S-400 SAM system supported by the 48Ya6 \u2018Podlet-K1\u2019 all-altitude long-range surveillance radar system.\n\nNumerous MANPADS provided to Ukrainian troops and later mobile air-defence teams meant that low-altitude Russian fixed-wing and rotary penetrating sorties beyond the frontlines proved to be prohibitively costly during March, and ceased by April 2022.\n\nThroughout the war, most Russian airstrikes have been against pre-designated targets with unguided bombs and rockets. The Su-34 fleet has regularly also fired stand-off missiles such as the Kh-29 and Kh-59 against fixed targets, and Su-30SM and Su-35S fighters have regularly fired Kh-31P and Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles to suppress and target Ukrainian SAM radars.\n\nWithout air superiority, Russia\u2019s attempts at strategic air attack have been limited to expensive cruise and ballistic missile barrages at a much more limited scale. These failed to achieve strategically decisive damage during the first seven months of the invasion. However, the latest iteration is a more focused and sustainable bombardment of the Ukrainian electricity grid, blending hundreds of cheap Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 loitering munitions against substations with continued use of cruise and ballistic missiles against larger targets.\n\nThe West must avoid complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity. It is purely thanks to its failure to destroy Ukraine\u2019s mobile SAM systems that Russia remains unable to effectively employ the potentially heavy and efficient aerial firepower of its fixed-wing bomber and multi-role fighter fleets to bombard Ukrainian strategic targets and frontline positions from medium altitude, as it did in Syria.\n\nIt follows that if Ukrainian SAMs are not resupplied with ammunition, and ultimately augmented and replaced with Western equivalents over time, the VKS will regain the ability to pose a major threat.\n\nIn the short term, Ukraine also needs large numbers of additional man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) and radar-guided anti-aircraft guns, such as the Gepard, to sustain and increase its ability to intercept the Shahed-136s and protect its remaining power infrastructure and repairs to damaged facilities.\n\nIn the medium term, Ukraine needs cost-effective ways to defend itself against the Shahed-136. One option could be compact radar and/or laser ranging and sighting systems to allow numerous existing anti-aircraft guns to be much more accurate and effective against them.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force fighter force needs modern Western fighters and missiles to sustainably counter the VKS. Russian pilots have been cautious throughout the war, so even a small number of Western fighters could have a major deterrent effect.\n\nAny Western fighter supplied in the short\u2013medium term needs to be capable of dispersed operations using mobile maintenance equipment and small support teams, and flying from relatively rough runways, to avoid being neutralised by Russian long-range missile strikes.",

White House officials then sought to walk that back, emphasizing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, not the US, would decide when and if to negotiate with Russia over its invasion of his country.\n\n>Milley spoke alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin after a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which coordinates military support for Ukraine among the US and allies. Milley said winter is typically a time when combat slows and the US is seeing the front lines in Ukraine beginning to stabilize. He said that might open a window for a political solution but acknowledged the fight was likely to go on.\n\n>He repeated his belief that Ukraine was unlikely to kick Russian forces out of all its territory anytime soon, something that Zelenskiy has said is Ukraine\u2019s main goal.\n\n>Standing a few feet from Milley, Austin underscored Milley\u2019s assurance that the US would support Ukraine for as long as it takes. But he didn\u2019t agree with Milley\u2019s assessment that the front lines of the war wouldn\u2019t change over the winter.\n\n>\u201cThere are countless numbers of people who have been amazed and astonished by what the Ukrainians have accomplished,\u201d Austin said. \u201cSo I won\u2019t presuppose what is possible or impossible for them.\u201d\n\nJust to be clear, Austin is also Milley\u2019s boss (in essence). [Rob Lee](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1591152760090923008) agrees with Austin.",

Russian pilots have been cautious throughout the war, so even a small number of Western fighters could have a major deterrent effect**.\"\n\nSo it's interesting you called me names for recommending basically the same thing as the paper you touted. True, they don't think the F-16 is the best choice, but the point remains: give Ukraine good Western planes before they run critically low on air defenses.

They need everything.)\n\nMy personal take on this: give them a fighter that can conduct SEAD in addition to shooting down cruise missiles.\n\nThe way I see it, you cannot conduct the ideal combined-arms offensive with just SAMs and antiaircraft guns. You'd want to use jets with HARMs to suppress Russian AD and attack key defenses in conjunction with drone-assisted artillery and attack aircraft or drones like TB2 Bayraktars, to pave the way for a ground assault that breaks through enemy lines quickly and with fewer casualties.",
