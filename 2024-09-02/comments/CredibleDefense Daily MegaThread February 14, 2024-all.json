From space, you are basically locked into your current orbit, as making even a relatively small inclination change requires more boost (delta v) than ICBMs or most satellites have, and you can't change your orbital speed without hitting the atmosphere or getting into a higher/slower orbit. Because they can't move much, it would take a huge number to get the total coverage you can achieve with just a single ICBM, around ~2000 to make a shell if each had a 200 mile radius range (they probably exceed 200 mile radius, but still). Targeting specific higher orbits such as a GEO satellite is also easier from Earth. They will also have lower reliability and a lower lifespan in the harsh environment of space instead of in a climate controlled silo/building where they can do inspections and maintenance.",

My very first impression back then with napkin calculation was that the drone would have about 0.5t of payload at most.\n\nIn any case, with the footage that has been released so far of various attacks,one of the things I've noticed, with some surprise, was that the Russian ships defend themselves with, seemingly only, MG fire from the side.\n\nWhen I've looked at pictures of the damage of such attacks (which granted, only one of the Rupucha has made it dockside after an attack), I've noticed that the ships look like they have double hulls.\n\nThis isn't unusual, the void space is usually used as ballast tank (for sea water) as needed.\n\nFrom the damage it seems that even if the drone manages to detonate next to the ship, the payload isn't quite enough to blow a large hole in the double platting. It looks like the inner plates manage to somewhat contain the explosion. This is certainly more applicable if the drones get detonated from the defensive fire further out.\n\nObviously, with repeated hits, the drones are more than capable to damage and sink the ships. Another thing I've noticed, from the pictures from the dry/floating dock where the surving Rupucha was taken, there doesn't seem to be shrapnel damage near the damaged area. Meaning that the drones use large HE payload without any significant or dedicated shrapnel.\n\nAccording to wiki (I know) the drones supposedly have about 200kg of payload. I am pretty sure they can fit more. In any case, I was curious if the drones could carry some sort of shrapnel element to enhance the damage they cause, especially if they get detonated some distance away before reaching the ship's side.\n\n[You can check my napkin calculations in the linked image.](https://imgur.com/a/6EpNab4)",

Because the road network sucked, with Afghan National Army and other forces strung out everywhere in remote forward operating bases and combat outposts, and because the last few years had been so tough for them, they were UTTERLY reliant on helicopters for casualty evacuation, resupply, mobility, and close air support.\n\nWhen Biden ordered the withdrawal, he refused to do as a phased withdrawal over time or even tell anyone. Top generals advised against it, he wouldn't listen. He wanted all US troops out ASAP. \n\nSo we literally abandoned our bases overnight, loaded everything that we could and flew home. We didn't even tell other NATO allies, various NGOs we were partnered with, American expats working as defense contractors, or even our Afghan allies. One day we were on the bases helping them, the next day we were gone.\n\nBecause Trump had organized the eventual withdrawal and the timelines with the Taliban in advance (which would only happen if the Taliban obeyed stipulations, which they didn't), they were prepared and waiting for the day. So as soon as the media reported it, while the ANSF and Afghan govt were shocked, the Taliban launched a nationwide offensive.\n\nThe Afghan Air Force had plenty of helicopters, with their own pilots and ground crew, flying a mix of some American but mostly Soviet era stuff we bought from third parties and gave to them because they're cheaper and easier to maintain than our stuff. But even then, the Afghan ground maintenance crews weren't skilled enough to keep them flying, they needed to rely on Western defense contractors who lived at the bigger Afghanistan bases to fix them. \n\nIt's the same with the US and other NATO countries, we too are utterly reliant on civilian contractors for logistics especially but also a whole lot of maintenance too. But the difference is, we plan to protect them. \n\nWhen the US left Afghanistan and didn't tell the contractors, they rightfully panicked and got the hell off of Afghanistan as fast as they could get to Kabul and board a flight out of the country.\n\nTwo weeks. That's how long it took before something like 95% of the Afghan Air Force was grounded, almost entirely due to routine maintenance issues, not ground fire.\n\nWithout helicopters, the Afghan National Army can't fight. They can't move around, resupply, evacuate their casualties, or beat off Taliban attacks, which were happening nonstop and everywhere. \n\nTheir overall strategy and their tactics were all based on the helicopters, without them they were forced to use vehicles on a limited number of horrible roads, one long gauntlet of ambushes to move, so they were fixed in place, under siege, with no hope of relief. \n\nThey were offered full pardons by the Taliban if they laid down their arms and walked away. Most took the offer, resistance meant certain death. \n\nSo the Afghan National Army collapsed, but that was no surprise, nobody expected them to hold long.

They were the ones who everyone expected to hold the Taliban back, but they too collapsed because their primary force multiplier, means of transportation, their lifeline was taken away.\n\nThat created a cascading effect as the provinces fell and chaos spread. Not only did a Western contractors handle Afghan aviation, they also handled nationwide military communications and logistics, so those collapsed too.

The [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67647379) previously did a piece on this, highlighting the language barrier that prevented some migrants from fully understanding the contracts they were signing with the MoD. According to the Russian Academy of Science's Institute of Economics, Russia was facing a labor shortage of almost [5mm](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-short-around-48-million-workers-2023-crunch-persist-izvestia-2023-12-24/) workers as at the end of 2023. There's a new report that marries the two stories, with the scheme to lure migrants for high paying construction jobs in occupied Ukraine, and then at times 'transferring' them to the army. Excerpts:\n\n>[Russia Lures Migrant Workers Into Ukraine, Only to Put Many on the Front Line](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-14/russia-war-in-ukraine-how-migrant-workers-are-lured-with-reconstruction-jobs?srnd=null)\n\n>>Migrants can wind up digging trenches or fighting on the front, risking jail in their home countries on charges of mercenary activity.\n\n>Job-seekers coming to Russia from former Soviet Union states are being sent to Ukraine to work on construction projects, but have at times wound up digging trenches and fighting on the battlefield. In the process, they risk running afoul of laws in their homelands that could land them in prison.\n\n>Migrants are lured by job postings on Russian websites offering construction work for a salary much higher than the market average. For example, construction work in the eastern Donbas region can promise as much as 350,000 rubles (almost $4,000) a month with accommodation, transportation and health insurance. By contrast, a machine operator in a factory makes up to $2,000 a month, already nearly 20% more than a year earlier, according to data from local recruitment service Superjob, as the competition for employees amid the war has fueled a wage spiral.\n\n>Valentina Chupik, a lawyer and the director of the human rights nonprofit organization Tong Jahoni, told Bloomberg News about 50 migrants from her practice went to Ukraine voluntarily, but \u201cthe promised salary was not paid, and on the way back to Russia they were not allowed to enter.\u201d Chupik said she also knew many cases of citizens from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan who had been tricked into working for nothing and then forced to dig trenches in combat zones.\n\n>One laborer, a man named Soleh from Tajikistan, said that people attempted to recruit him to fight in Ukraine. \u201cWhile I was sitting in the deportation center in November, they actively recruited me, and said they would give me citizenship if I signed a contract.\u201d Though he was promised \u201ca lot of money,\u201d he opted to return home, he said.\n\n>\u201cThey recruit everywhere,\u201d Soleh said. \u201cA friend of mine was forced to sign a contract when he went to the migration center to apply for a residence permit. Those who go to construction sites in the DNR and LNR are persuaded to go fight there,\u201d he said, referring to the occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n>Many of the companies involved have contracts with the Defense Ministry, said Sergei Khrabrykh, a former defense contractor who now lives outside Russia. Because of that, workers can't make claims against the companies employing them.\n\n>Khrabrykh said that some 2,000 migrants ended up working in the occupied areas after being deceived about the nature of the jobs.\n\n>Putin was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin, who oversees construction and regional development, as he inspected restoration and infrastructure work in the city, according to the Kremlin. Khusnullin in 2022 called the reconstruction efforts in the occupied territories \u201cthe country\u2019s largest construction project.\u201d At the time, he also said 44,000 builders were working in the territories, according to the state-run Tass news service.\n\n>All information related to companies involved in contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry is classified. The total numbers of foreigners working or fighting in the occupied territories has never been disclosed.\n\n>Over the past year, several former Soviet states including Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, have sentenced people to jail over fighting for Russia in Ukraine, according to reports in local media. Prison terms have ranged from two to 10 years.\n\n>Those who come to Russia in search of work are often ignorant of the law, have a poor command of Russian and don\u2019t realize what they may be signing up for, said one person who works in Moscow on migration issues for citizens of Uzbekistan, but asked not to be identified because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the media.\n\n>\u201cThis does not change the fact that they are criminals,\u201d Chupik, the human rights lawyer, said. \u201cThey are criminals who find themselves in a difficult situation.\u201d",

Not an area of personal knowledge, and not a lawyer, but your interpretation of the Budapest Memorandum from the Western side seems fair, but then when one of the parties to it invades another, it becomes a more complicated issue.</p>\n</div>",

Simply because they have the upper hand geographically and that NATO is ill-pepared for that (aswell as some other factors I'll mention in a bit). The Baltic countries have tiny populations (and as a bonus Russian minorities) and tiny militaries aswell as no strategic depth.

But Russias demographics are horrendous which will probably weaken Russia in the decades to come. So invading before that would be a longterm investment strategically for them (in their mind).\n\n5: This might be a bit far fetched, but if China would invade Taiwan at roughly the same time (2025-2030) The US would have to shift an enormous part of their forces (mainly airforce) away from Europe, thereby possible giving the Russians a chance for localized air superiority and just generally more of a chance at success.",

It smells of the same stench of the current, \"the West forced Ukraine to keep fighting against Russia\" narrative where Ukraine is some sort of mindless puppet. It also completely ignores Russia's more important role in pushing the negotiations [that they would later completely shit on]. I'm not sure what Ukraine got out of it, but I can't imagine it was better than getting security assurances instead of guarantee's for nuclear weapons. In the contrast of Biden's perhaps *overly cautious* non-escalatory response, it does sting a bit more. But placing all the blame on the US is more of a emotional response than logical one here.",
