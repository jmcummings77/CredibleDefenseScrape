There's no guarantee that any spy craft, no matter how \"old school\" would have provided advanced warning of the attack. And even if it did, it wouldn't do any good unless that information could be analyzed, disseminated, and acted upon in time.\n\nRather, I think the lesson is that intelligence is no substitute for preparedness. The assumption should be that the enemy isn't stupid and if they're sufficiently determined they can achieve surprise.

This attack seems to just be good implementation of SOP.\n\nWith both sides relying on infiltrating dismounted infantry to perform the assault role, these styles of FPV close support or other switchblade style drone hits should, in theory, start to become more prevalent because of cost, logistics, and coordination issues with traditional indirect fire support. A squad of FPV operators seems to be easier to transport, set up, and be in direct comms with the storm detachments than traditional indirect support pre-positioned for the attack, but require a couple of layers of communications between units, making them kind of unsuitable for on call strikes rather than pre-planned prep strikes, outside of maybe AGS, but those are terrain dependent, and have danger close issues with fragmentation.\n\nThe other less thing to take away, which obviously are not applicable to the whole front, is the lack to defensive artillery fire or mortar against the assault. This reminds me of back in Bakhmut, Madyar from the Birds of Madyar specifically said they try to not waste ammunition on groups less than 5 for their indirect assets, and Russians here using only 4 to assault a forward trench in a tree line held by a squad at least. And I wonder if that's why fire team sized dismounted infantry assaults are the norm here?\n\nThis is my guess, but I believe in contrast with both sides adopting defend at all cost policy, there is a particular focus on economy of ammunition/hard assets when defenders on both sides evaluate the size of the attack, and would therefore be disinclined to use heavier assets for defense when the offensive force does not include them.\n\nIf the opponent is not using armour vehicles to attack, then as defenders they try not to too. Heavier artillery tasked to defend sections that are being attacked with armour, and saves ammunition when attacking force doesn't warrant it. Making armour hit and run tactics the preferred method of using amour vehicles, (indirect fire HE, carousel tactics of MBTs, drive by tree line shots by AFVs have all becoming staples of AFV usage recently) because of counter attacks themselves being proportional to the attack. And making dismounted infantry assault preferred too, since they don't draw too much artillery from the defenders as well. And generally speaking this economy of force defense would work, until the defender messes up on their evaluation of the attack and misappropriate defense assets, such as this case, it was not 4 infantry men attacking them, it was 4 infantry men plus a whole squad of FPV drones.\n\nObviously, don't use a single event to extrapolate the entire war, but its interesting to see evolution of Russian assault doctrines for the past year, and that they are not static but continuously evolve.",

                "body": "I see, and I understands your point being Ukrainians are also using drones to strike individuals? That they are willing to utilize drones to defend against small scale dismounted attacks. Please correct me if I misunderstood.\n\nHowever, that's not the point I am making, the point I am making is as follows.\n\n1. FPV Drones or Grenade Drones are not good defensive assets against an assault, unless you have immediate comms to a unit nearby that can launch at command. They have loitering time, and distance issue. Even when the Russians utilized their lancets as defensive assets, it took them more than 30 minutes to arrive on the battlefield, rendering them mostly as clean up tools. (The infamous Orikhiv assault)\n2. In contrast, best defensive assets against assault is on call indirect fire (artillery, mortars, AGS when terrain permits), AFVs, mobile ATGM crews. These were notably absent in this attack, I do not think the AFU was lacking these assets in the area per se, but rather that they did not have enough time to respond to the attack and misjudged the scale and purpose of the attack. Maskirovka in action.\n3. Conversely, FPV drones, and grenade drones (to a very much lesser extant), are great flexible offensive/recon tools. And is the whole reason switchblades were adopted for use, and why US SF had good feedbacks as well. Their weakness in loitering time and distance is mitigated if their support can be pre-planned and pre-positioned like a prepatory artillery strike. (And on second thought, easily missed by defensive observers like drones and human lookouts, since ToT could be as short as a couple minutes and sound of FPV drones travels around a couple hundred meters only)\n\nWhat the vast majority of Russian/Ukrainian drone attack videos, including the strike on the single soldier near rubizhene,  have been accomplishing, and tactically doing is drone harassment attacks during positional lulls between assault operations, or before assault operations. This video showed a different tactic/doctrine evolution, that is more inline with how western theorists planned with drone technology, is why I posted it in the first place. I remember seeing the Ukrainians used the switchblade not in line with its tactical goal when it was developed and confused.\n\nThe majority of drone units on both sides are using their drone assets to spoil preparations, keep enemies on the toes, to disguise potential attack avenue or feinting an assault. I do not think I've seen a video of an FPV squad loitering above an assault element prior to this video, please correct me if I am wrong. And to my memory, correct me if I am wrong here as well, Magyar's interview was about him calling defensive artillery strikes in response to wagner infiltration units in day time, not drone attacks.\n\nAnd as another extended thought, both sides could start adopting this into their field SOPs with dispersed platoon attack on position, hopefully a platoon or at least a squad of FPV drone operators as close in support, using fireteams to recon by fire, getting shot at, then the standby drone squads striking immediately at the defenders. Turns the offensive on call support into minutes to respond. Elevating their roles from harassment tactics.\n\nIf the assault fails, you'd lost a fire team, but the drone operators would have hit the defenders as well.\n\nThis is kind of in line with the USMC force design squad as well, but rather on a larger unit scale. (platoons supporting platoons, rather than teams supporting teams).\n\nI wonder what kind of wargame results the USMC had when it came to their new squad designs. Russians developing their SOP to be (apparently) separate attachable and plannable assets in support of an attack is distinct, and who knows which ones are better.",

Please correct me if I misunderstood.</p>\n\n<p>However, that&#39;s not the point I am making, the point I am making is as follows.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>FPV Drones or Grenade Drones are not good defensive assets against an assault, unless you have immediate comms to a unit nearby that can launch at command. They have loitering time, and distance issue. Even when the Russians utilized their lancets as defensive assets, it took them more than 30 minutes to arrive on the battlefield, rendering them mostly as clean up tools. (The infamous Orikhiv assault)</li>\n<li>In contrast, best defensive assets against assault is on call indirect fire (artillery, mortars, AGS when terrain permits), AFVs, mobile ATGM crews. These were notably absent in this attack, I do not think the AFU was lacking these assets in the area per se, but rather that they did not have enough time to respond to the attack and misjudged the scale and purpose of the attack. Maskirovka in action.</li>\n<li>Conversely, FPV drones, and grenade drones (to a very much lesser extant), are great flexible offensive/recon tools. And is the whole reason switchblades were adopted for use, and why US SF had good feedbacks as well. Their weakness in loitering time and distance is mitigated if their support can be pre-planned and pre-positioned like a prepatory artillery strike. (And on second thought, easily missed by defensive observers like drones and human lookouts, since ToT could be as short as a couple minutes and sound of FPV drones travels around a couple hundred meters only)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What the vast majority of Russian/Ukrainian drone attack videos, including the strike on the single soldier near rubizhene,  have been accomplishing, and tactically doing is drone harassment attacks during positional lulls between assault operations, or before assault operations. This video showed a different tactic/doctrine evolution, that is more inline with how western theorists planned with drone technology, is why I posted it in the first place. I remember seeing the Ukrainians used the switchblade not in line with its tactical goal when it was developed and confused.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of drone units on both sides are using their drone assets to spoil preparations, keep enemies on the toes, to disguise potential attack avenue or feinting an assault. I do not think I&#39;ve seen a video of an FPV squad loitering above an assault element prior to this video, please correct me if I am wrong. And to my memory, correct me if I am wrong here as well, Magyar&#39;s interview was about him calling defensive artillery strikes in response to wagner infiltration units in day time, not drone attacks.</p>\n\n<p>And as another extended thought, both sides could start adopting this into their field SOPs with dispersed platoon attack on position, hopefully a platoon or at least a squad of FPV drone operators as close in support, using fireteams to recon by fire, getting shot at, then the standby drone squads striking immediately at the defenders. Turns the offensive on call support into minutes to respond. Elevating their roles from harassment tactics.</p>\n\n<p>If the assault fails, you&#39;d lost a fire team, but the drone operators would have hit the defenders as well.</p>\n\n<p>This is kind of in line with the USMC force design squad as well, but rather on a larger unit scale. (platoons supporting platoons, rather than teams supporting teams).</p>\n\n<p>I wonder what kind of wargame results the USMC had when it came to their new squad designs. Russians developing their SOP to be (apparently) separate attachable and plannable assets in support of an attack is distinct, and who knows which ones are better.</p>\n</div>",

Guided bombs would require slightly greater uncertainties so the flak guns would need to cover a larger area in the sky to guarantee intercept, but again the math to figure this out is just really straightforward numerical analysis and the basic ballistic physics people learn in AP physics. So the reason no one bothers to do so is exactly as you describe, it's just not effective.\n\nI do not happen to know (and I seriously suspect the real answer is classified) whether the more recently developed High Energy Laser/Directed Energy Weapons the US has been working on have the ability to target the fuze on a gravity bomb. Those fuzes are typically airburst or contact, which in most existing gravity bombs are mounted on the nose and therefore exposed to HEL intercept. It would be trivial to develop triggers that can be moved within the bomb casing though (e.g., an internally mounted accelerometer will give a strong signal when slamming into the ground as compared to regular operating conditions so can be used for a contact fuze where maybe a crushable piezoelectric fuze might have been used previously), so I don't think this would be effective in the longer term as belligerents adapt to the new technology. But with so many legacy bombs vulnerable to that form of interdiction, it might be worth developing the capability.\n\nWith typical internal explosive payloads being largely inert as you described, the bombs would either impact as duds or detonate prematurely in mid-air, depending on whether the HEL disables the fuze or instead triggers it to detonate the primary payload. Disabling seems like the more probable effect of destruction, because the bombs are specifically engineered to be difficult to detonate by accident, e.g. during a crash. Plus prematurely detonating an airburst weapon doesn't necessarily gain you much, if it's coming in on a relatively flat trajectory, giving the HEL a short intercept line of sight.

Larger ammunition stores would be a start, but a more fundamental question is whether a focus on small numbers of exquisite systems is optimal.  Use of unmanned systems that rely on mass-produced components, can be produced in great numbers in war.  Piloted systems that  rely on unique components made with unique equipment can&#39;t be scaled up quickly and the training of pilots is a major constraint.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</div>",

The progenitor of this German way of war was probably Frederick the Great, and he preferred that \"Prussia always attacks!\" for the same geopolitical and economic reasons that would apply to Germany in the World Wars: as a means of keeping wars short because of a lack of resources and being surrounded and outnumbered. And just like Germany in the World Wars when he found himself in an unexpected attritional struggle in the 1750s all he could do was grit his teeth and hope conditions would improve. Luckily for him they did, and being prepared for this potential outcome was a key feature of his later writings. For instance, he expanded Prussia's artillery by 600%, claiming they would be key to any future attritional and positional struggle and that this expansion was still insufficient. After the loss of 6th Army at Stalingrad the first thing Hitler would say is \"we have to remember Frederick,\" and his long, arduous, and ultimately successful attritional struggle. \n\nWhen you examine Hitler's grand strategic plan for war one of its key pillars was resource security for this exact reason. This turned out to be an extremely accurate concern since the Allied plan at the outset of the war was to starve Germany of resources in a war of attrition. Food was assumed to be in short supply due to the Soviets' ideological opposition to the Nazis, and any supplemental iron from Sweden would be handled in the winters by naval blockade due to the Baltic freezing over. Oil from the Soviet Union would likewise be irrelevant and the Allies had a deal with Romania to buy all of their surplus so none would be left for Germany. \n\nGermany took steps to mitigate each of these problems. Hitler focused significant resources on agricultural independence, acquiring Romania as a satellite nation, invading Norway to secure a route for Swedish iron supplies no matter the season, and securing treaties with the USSR for the import of grain, iron, and oil as a stop-gap for an eventual hostile take-over. This is why the Nazi generals were directed to prepare an invasion plan for the Soviet Union which concentrated on the southern axis where the agricultural, industrial, and petrochemical resources were concentrated. They weren't interested in this, however, and instead created a plan with an overweighted center axis. One must imagine their chagrin when they had to turn army group center toward Kiev in the autumn for lack of progress along the southern axis which was their own damn fault.\n\nIn post-war memoirs, speeches, and interviews key Soviet figures like Stalin, Krushchev, and Zhukov repeatedly state that their victory in the Great Patriotic War was neither easy nor inevitable, and the loss of their key industrial and commodity producing areas (and their partial replacement through the Lend-Lease program) was a significant factor in this. If these losses had been accelerated by a clearer long-term strategy on the Nazis' part then who knows what may have happened to them. Perhaps, like World War One, Russia wouldn't have made it to the end of the war that their side eventually won.\n\nAnyway, this is getting pretty far afield. My point is that historically a lot of fast wars turn out to be slow wars and that lack of preparation for a prolonged war is frequently cited as a mistake by their participants in hindsight.

To see this in action, just look at the dread KA-52 ATGM scourge. Fast moving platforms not possible 70 years ago, firing missiles with a many kilometer range, which are very likely to knock out (either hard kill or mission kill) vital assets on the first shot. The maxim from the 1970s remains true, if you can be seen you can be shot, if you can be shot you can be killed, at nearly any range on the battlefield. Drones and better surveillance only compounds this problem. Moreover the mechanization of ground forces only compounds this problem as reserves can be held further and further back and delayed longer and longer while the covering forces sap offensive momentum. We saw this with the UA offensive this summer. So this is all to say that the dynamic works both ways, I would argue that both the offense and defense remain in heavy alignment as a result of the continued PGM revolution, with the defense enjoying its own natural and inherent advantage. \n\nRE: Force rations, I also continue to align with Donn Starry's thinking on this from the 1980s. After leaving the Army he gave a series of interviews on his career, and looking back at the '73 Arab-Israeli war he said one of the major lessons he took away from that was that outside of extreme force rations, he cites 5:1 for either side, the old maxim of who has more troops doesn't really hold up. That classic 3:1 ratio he dismisses. And thats because the technology afforded to both sides is such that a small defending force can have an outsized effect, while a small offensive force (if handled well) can likewise destabilize and disrupt a much larger formation. What produces the decisive result, he argues, is who has the better training, doctrine, and equipment and who handle themselves the best in combat. Tactics become especially critical, because Starry also felt that Americans too often focused on big picture forces (Soviet regiments crashing into American battalions) where there would never be an advantageous force ratio. But at the petite tactical level American forces could, and should according to doctrine Starry deployed, focus on restoring local numerical superiority. Dont focus, for example, on destroying an entire Motor-Rifle regiment. Instead focus on destroying one company at a time in smaller piecemeal battles where you outmatch them 4 or 5:1. \n\nWhere Starry's analysis breaks down in comparison to the UA war is that the Soviets would never have really dug in like the Russians are now. Their doctrine would have resorted by now to tactical nuclear options rather than lose the momentum on any one assault. But in the abstract IMO what Starry says is about what were seeing. The battlefield is too wide and dynamic for force ratios to matter, so individual training, equipment, and tactics matter more. Ukraine still has mostly ex-soviet equipment, its training is very uneven, and its tactics are still solidly post-Soviet. So in each category it is unable to derive a clear enough advantage to overcome the natural anti-momentum of a defensive system.",

And thats because the technology afforded to both sides is such that a small defending force can have an outsized effect, while a small offensive force (if handled well) can likewise destabilize and disrupt a much larger formation. What produces the decisive result, he argues, is who has the better training, doctrine, and equipment and who handle themselves the best in combat. Tactics become especially critical, because Starry also felt that Americans too often focused on big picture forces (Soviet regiments crashing into American battalions) where there would never be an advantageous force ratio. But at the petite tactical level American forces could, and should according to doctrine Starry deployed, focus on restoring local numerical superiority. Dont focus, for example, on destroying an entire Motor-Rifle regiment. Instead focus on destroying one company at a time in smaller piecemeal battles where you outmatch them 4 or 5:1. </p>\n\n<p>Where Starry&#39;s analysis breaks down in comparison to the UA war is that the Soviets would never have really dug in like the Russians are now. Their doctrine would have resorted by now to tactical nuclear options rather than lose the momentum on any one assault. But in the abstract IMO what Starry says is about what were seeing. The battlefield is too wide and dynamic for force ratios to matter, so individual training, equipment, and tactics matter more. Ukraine still has mostly ex-soviet equipment, its training is very uneven, and its tactics are still solidly post-Soviet. So in each category it is unable to derive a clear enough advantage to overcome the natural anti-momentum of a defensive system.</p>\n</div>",

It makes sense to use the 1AC for Avdiivka since Donetsk locals are motivated to eliminate the artillery threat to their city. However, the 1AC, while a powerful unit, has no reinforcement depth - no way to fill the gaps in ranks that will be generated quickly by a battle of attrition. As a consequence, while Russia prefers to use \"disposable\" locals for this battle, it will soon have to start filling the gaps with Russia-proper units.\n\n3) If the Ukrainians accept a battle of attrition in Avdiivka - what can they do to make it a battle on their own and not on Russia's terms? I see two options: 1) counterattack around Avdiivka to straighten the frontline and relieve the pressure on the supply bottleneck or 2) make a major counterattack elsewhere to attract Russian reserves and make them suspend the Avdiivka offensive.

            "body": "I feel that this post is missing a crucial point - and that is the question of whether or not a battle of attrition is bad for Ukraine or not. Why is that?\n\nAs things are, neither side is able to make strategic advances. The war is not moving and it is a battle of attrition anyway. Therefore, if Ukraine does not fight in place A, it would have to fight in place B. \n\nMaybe place B offers better conditions for the defender than place A. However, if Russia has the initiative, it can pick where it wants to fight. And there is no guarantee that place B as picked by Russia is better for Ukraine than place A.\n\nSecond (and the core of this argument should be above dispute), inflicting losses on Russia is necessary for Ukraine. Russia does not produce enought new equipment to make up for losses. A majority of replacements comes from the soviet stockpile. This stockpile is large, but not infinite. Furthermore, the deeper Russia has to dig into the stockpile, the worse the equipment that comes out of it will be.\n\nIt stands to reason that Russia will get weaker as the war goes on - because of the limited and degrading nature of the stockpile and the current inability of Russia to produce enough new equipment to make up for the losses.\n\nAlso, if Russia is able to catch a breath, it seems likely that their ability to generate new force is beyond that of Ukraine - at least as long as the stockpile lasts. The ability of Ukraine is limited by the willingness and ability of the West to provide equipment and training. As of now, it seems that the Russian ability to produce new equipment and reactivate the stockpile is higher than what Ukraine can be expected to receive in the next months. Catching a breath right now seems to be better for Russia than for Ukraine.\n\nI would therefore argue that keeping the war \"hot\" and thereby keeping Russia's forces depleted is a net positive for Ukraine, even if that means that Ukraine suffers from the same problems.\n\nTherefore, unless fighting in Avdiika is substantially unfavourable for Ukraine because of the conditions, it seems to me that taking the fight where it is could be the better strategy.",

Russia does not produce enought new equipment to make up for losses. A majority of replacements comes from the soviet stockpile. This stockpile is large, but not infinite. Furthermore, the deeper Russia has to dig into the stockpile, the worse the equipment that comes out of it will be.</p>\n\n<p>It stands to reason that Russia will get weaker as the war goes on - because of the limited and degrading nature of the stockpile and the current inability of Russia to produce enough new equipment to make up for the losses.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if Russia is able to catch a breath, it seems likely that their ability to generate new force is beyond that of Ukraine - at least as long as the stockpile lasts. The ability of Ukraine is limited by the willingness and ability of the West to provide equipment and training. As of now, it seems that the Russian ability to produce new equipment and reactivate the stockpile is higher than what Ukraine can be expected to receive in the next months. Catching a breath right now seems to be better for Russia than for Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>I would therefore argue that keeping the war &quot;hot&quot; and thereby keeping Russia&#39;s forces depleted is a net positive for Ukraine, even if that means that Ukraine suffers from the same problems.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, unless fighting in Avdiika is substantially unfavourable for Ukraine because of the conditions, it seems to me that taking the fight where it is could be the better strategy.</p>\n</div>",

They are essentially at ongoing war with the Muslim world in that both Israel and the Muslim world (leadership) have different ideas for what constitutes the land that Israel occupies. \n\nLets dig into these two different ideas for the land that Israel occupies.\n\n1. Israel believes they have a duty to have a Jewish homeland incase Jews are persecuted throughout the world. This idea comes directly from the holocaust where Jews were murdered in the final solution due to the Nazi's being unable to forcibly remove Jews from Nazi Germany. The idea is that Israel is the ethnic homeland of the Jews and if they are persecuted, they can retreat to the homeland. The solution to this idea requires that Israel remain majority ruled by ethnic Jews. That solution can and will require the use of force as needed to remain majority rule by ethnic Jews.\n2. The predominant view of the Muslim world (leadership) and Palestine leadership is that Israel is a colonial country. The land the Israel occupies was taken from Muslim people forceably. Essentially people with western ideals \"invaded\" the Muslim's that live in the area. This is reinforced by the founding of Israel (via war and violence) and the subsequent wars where Israel has continued to gain land and influence in the area using violence. The solution to this idea requires Jews to be removed from their occupied lands. \n\nThis conflict has been going on for 75 years. It is based on these two conflicting ideas. How is this resolved? How can Israel and Palestine reach a stable coexistence?\n\nA resolution to a conflict occurs when the \\*loser\\* of the war decides to not fight. That is Palestine and the Muslim world. That is unless the loser eventually becomes the winner.\n\nThe current strategy used by Israel leadership is one of violence, the threat of violence, and of containment. This strategy is clearly \\*NOT\\* focused on the Hamas leadership that have perpetuated violence. Israel's strategy currently focuses specifically on non-discriminant killing of anyone slightly associated with Hamas.\n\nHowever, Israel being a mostly democratic country with western ideals, they cannot perform genocide in the classical sense (killing all non-ethnics). Which is a good thing, and I honestly don't think ethnic cleansing is a good strategy outside of the moral implications.\n\nAnother aspect is Israel is a small nation surrounded by enemies that number 20-200x their population depending on how you count it (Syria, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc). In order for Israel to remain dominant and secure, Israel needs to maintain military dominance either from support from western allies or via technological dominance.\n\nThe enemies of Israel are mostly kept in check due to the rules based order of the world. This is the western support. Essentially Egypt doesn't want to invade Israel due to internal struggles that would result from the USA sanctioning Egypt. The same goes for Saudi Arabia who needs US support in order for the King of KSA to remain in power. Iran doesn't think they could win an all-out fight, and they probably could not win an all out fight right now.\n\nEssentially, the Muslim world does not invade or attack Israel due to a perception that it is not in the best interest to attack Israel. Mainly, due to the rules based order. \n\nThis leaves Israel with two \\*MAJOR\\* problems, and these two problems lead me to believe that Israel could cease to exist as a nation in a few decades.\n\nFirst, there is a large attack against the rules based order right now. That is mainly perpetuated by a rising China and other non-aligned countries to the USA. So there is a decently high likelihood that the rules based order could break down in the coming decades. In a world where China invades Taiwan, North Korea attacks South Korea, there are a lot of civil wars throughout the developing world, and the fight in Ukraine continues. If a world like that exists, there will be no appetite for the USA to be involved seriously in another conflict in the middle-east. Or elsewhere. The rules base order will be temporarily suspended. \n\nSecond, Israel is currently banking \\*heavily\\* on their technological supremacy in order to maintain dominance. This is under threat due to two reasons. First, the developing world is advancing rapidly, and this does include advanced weapon systems. Drones are an example of that where a small military can heavily impact a large, more advanced military due to the proliferation of simple yet effective technology. Second, Israel doesn't have a large population. Technology is based on economies and economies are based on population size. This indicates that the long term trend (decades) is that the technological supremacy of Israel will narrow. \n\nPut this all together and Israel really badly needs to find a way to convince Palestine and the Muslim world to stop fighting. How they can do this is a big question. \n\nRight now, they are focusing specifically on occupying the Gaza strip, the west bank, and banking on their military dominance in order to achieve those goals. Their military dominance is not guaranteed and will likely be thwarted in the coming decades due to the two reasons above. \n\nMy ultimate prediction with all of this is that sometime in the next 2-3 decades, I believe Israel will cease to be nation. The story goes something like this, when Israel is weak and the rules based order are particularly weak, the Muslim world will perform an invasion of Israel and Israel's weapons of military dominance will be thwarted. The remaining Jews that live in Israel will either be forceably removed or forced to live under less-than ideal circumstances. \n\nIt's quite a bold prediction. The big challenge I have with any prediction that Israel will keep the status quo is that the status quo depends on two assumptions. Specifically, the assumption that Israel will maintain military dominance and the assumption that the USA will always come to Israel's rescue. If one of those assumptions is no longer true, Israel is in serious trouble as a nation. And those assumptions only need to lapse \\*temporarily\\* for Israel to remain a nation. And I do believe these assumptions will be tested in the coming decades. \n\nTLDR: If I were Jewish, I still wouldn't move to Israel.",

Ideally this comes with a coalition in the knesset or similar parliament with a balance of arab and Israeli representatives. Many people will say this is untenable but there are examples from all of human history (including within Israel) where people who once were in conflict can live in peace.\n\nOther commenters say the \"Muslim World\" decided to stop fighting long ago, which I find innaccurate. The failure of the Syrian rebellion helped Iran, Syria, militias in Iraq, Hezbollah, and Houthis create an alliance that does pose an existential threat to Israel. In the short term, I see those organizations mostly being defensive in nature but over time will get stronger rather than weaker. Western efforts to undermine this alliance have failed (Operation Timber Sycamore) and there is no domestic appetite for a US led intervention. There are also very few strategic allies in the area that pose a threat (see the KSA's failure to defeat the Houthis).\n\nI think the likely endgame for this particular situation is a continuation of the status quo, meaning a probable withdraw from Gaza and rearmament on both sides. I believe this because I do not think Israel has much of an appetite for IDF casualties, nor do I believe their internal economy can weather 10% of their population being mobilized.",
