By the afternoon the joint forces defending the city had managed to expel the RSF. The militiamen\u2019s behaviour offers a small glimpse in to the horrors that will be inflicted on Al Fashir if it fell. There is no reason to believe that the RSF isn\u2019t intent on perpetrating the same kind of genocidal massacres in Al Fashir as they have committed in El Geniena. \nSudan''\n\nhttps://x.com/MohanadElbalal/status/1822293619606159525\n\n>''A Libyan National Army ID card found on one the dead RSF militiamen who attacked Al Fashir earlier this morning. The RSF is heavily dependent on foreign fighters to wage its war on the Sudanese people. ''\nhttps://x.com/MohanadElbalal/status/1822281830311014460\n\n\nIt seems the SAF are slowly improving they credit their foreign backers like Iran and T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n>''Another source in the Air Force says that a group of air force officers had been trained in T\u00fcrkiye in the use of various types of drones. A source from the Sovereign Council days that the government had secured the necessary funds to purchase these weapons.\nhttps://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1822263845089333451\n\n>''However, the source accused the UAE of obstructing some of the military\u2019s shipments by sea, disrupting several arms deals and holding ships carrying military equipment in some Red Sea countries.''\nhttps://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1822263848931340393\n\n>The martyr of the battle today in Al -Fasher, Lieutenant Pilot Muhammad Sabri, we ask God to accept it and enter Paradise with the friends and martyrs  and all the martyrs of the armed forces \nhttps://x.com/emo2022q/status/1822304734079766677\n\n>''We got another scumbag.Chadian rebel commander got killed in El-Fasher.Field commander of the Chadian armed opposition, Mehdi Bashir of ( FACT) movement, only two days ago threatening to invade El Fasher but today he got done in broad daylight as his head ripped off by bullets.

There's a rumours circulated that he was released on conditions to fight with RSF in Sudan.''\n\nhttps://x.com/saeneen/status/1822277115930128775\n\nI'd assume that to mean tribal connections got him free given the blood ties shared by the RSF.\n\n>''Usually, the militia publishes videos documenting its attacks on the city of El Fasher, even if it suffers losses.

For the past months these refugees have been denied any humanitarian support&#39;&#39;\n<a href=\"https://x.com/MinanYousif/status/1821502675730505750\">https://x.com/MinanYousif/status/1821502675730505750</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are reports of something similar happening the refuge camps in Sudan seems the refuges are choosing their own fate let&#39;s hope they survive.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#39;&#39;Today\u2019s quick update [Aug 9]:- RSF shells Omdurman Maternity Hospital, just 24 hours after it was rehabilitated and reopened to receive patients.  - Per ICRC, 2 out of 3 people in Sudan do not have access to healthcare. &#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;The shell fired by RSF militia killed a boy from the children in Paradise kindergarten [Al Hattana neighbourhood, Omdurman, Khartoum state] &amp; a street vendor named Khalid  you can hear the women in the kindergarten (used as a sheltering center) crying loudly....&#39;&#39;\n<a href=\"https://x.com/missinchident/status/1822284345094086929\">https://x.com/missinchident/status/1822284345094086929</a></p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;Reports from Al Fashir: the RSF managed to infiltrate the Southern districts of the city this morning; the militiamen entered homes and began massacring residents in the most brutal fashion. By the afternoon the joint forces defending the city had managed to expel the RSF. The militiamen\u2019s behaviour offers a small glimpse in to the horrors that will be inflicted on Al Fashir if it fell. There is no reason to believe that the RSF isn\u2019t intent on perpetrating the same kind of genocidal massacres in Al Fashir as they have committed in El Geniena. \nSudan&#39;&#39;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/MohanadElbalal/status/1822293619606159525\">https://x.com/MohanadElbalal/status/1822293619606159525</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#39;&#39;A Libyan National Army ID card found on one the dead RSF militiamen who attacked Al Fashir earlier this morning. The RSF is heavily dependent on foreign fighters to wage its war on the Sudanese people. &#39;&#39;\n<a href=\"https://x.com/MohanadElbalal/status/1822281830311014460\">https://x.com/MohanadElbalal/status/1822281830311014460</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems the SAF are slowly improving they credit their foreign backers like Iran and T\u00fcrkiye.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#39;&#39;Another source in the Air Force says that a group of air force officers had been trained in T\u00fcrkiye in the use of various types of drones. A source from the Sovereign Council days that the government had secured the necessary funds to purchase these weapons.\n<a href=\"https://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1822263845089333451\">https://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1822263845089333451</a></p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;However, the source accused the UAE of obstructing some of the military\u2019s shipments by sea, disrupting several arms deals and holding ships carrying military equipment in some Red Sea countries.&#39;&#39;\n<a href=\"https://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1822263848931340393\">https://x.com/PatrickHeinisc1/status/1822263848931340393</a></p>\n\n<p>The martyr of the battle today in Al -Fasher, Lieutenant Pilot Muhammad Sabri, we ask God to accept it and enter Paradise with the friends and martyrs  and all the martyrs of the armed forces \n<a href=\"https://x.com/emo2022q/status/1822304734079766677\">https://x.com/emo2022q/status/1822304734079766677</a></p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;We got another scumbag.Chadian rebel commander got killed in El-Fasher.Field commander of the Chadian armed opposition, Mehdi Bashir of ( FACT) movement, only two days ago threatening to invade El Fasher but today he got done in broad daylight as his head ripped off by bullets. Mehdi Bashir was a POW in 2021 of rebellion incursion attempt in Chad that led to death of Chadian former president Idriss Deby. There&#39;s a rumours circulated that he was released on conditions to fight with RSF in Sudan.&#39;&#39;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/saeneen/status/1822277115930128775\">https://x.com/saeneen/status/1822277115930128775</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d assume that to mean tribal connections got him free given the blood ties shared by the RSF.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#39;&#39;Usually, the militia publishes videos documenting its attacks on the city of El Fasher, even if it suffers losses. What is noteworthy is that it has not yet broadcasted any video clip about tonight\u2019s attack. The last time this happened was the day Ali Yaqoub Maarda died.&#39;&#39;\n<a href=\"https://x.com/yasseralfadol/status/1822240798361981357\">https://x.com/yasseralfadol/status/1822240798361981357</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note while some are saying this is a result of loses my guess is the footage today would been akin to Srbenca  is why they are not publishing it if they got the civilians before being stopped.</p>\n</div>",

I think that we will only know the answer to this question in hindsight.

Regardless of Ukraine's suffering, this will not be the last war ever fought. To effectively condone such a violation of international law only makes it easier for the next belligerent who thinks it's a good idea.\n\n>why shouldn't Ukraine do what's necessary to get their citizens back?\n\nWho's saying it's necessary apart from you? Is it impossible for Ukraine to win the war conventionally without doing the same things Russia does? Again, do you think Ukraine should start making border raids to abduct Russian civilians?\n\n>it would literally be the best option for reducing the total number of civilian captives in the war- and reducing that total would better adhere to the spirit of what the Geneva Conventions were trying to achieve.\n\nThis  utilitarian mindset ignores the fact the GCs made hostage taking explicitly forbidden for a reason. There are carve-outs for proportionality concerning certain actions in the Conventions, and hostage taking does not get one. You do not want a grey area where it's allowed (and therefore encouraged) to start rounding up civilians of an opposing state so you can use them for your own benefit. Even if the Ukrainians are perfect saints in their actions (aside from the literal, forceful abduction), it is not a door that should be opened.\n\n>I'd be rather in favor of a stronger system for dealing with war crimes.\n\nThen stop trying to weaken things by advocating for states committing them\n\nAnd to attack this from two different points of view,\n\n* If the US did nothing while an allied state committed an obvious act that is explicitly spelled out as requiring arrest of the offending party you just further reinforce the notion that the \"Rules based Order\" is just \"Rules when it suits the US\". You may or may not believe in it, but it still can be a useful lever of soft power\n* Consider the optics of it.

To effectively condone such a violation of international law only makes it easier for the next belligerent who thinks it&#39;s a good idea.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>why shouldn&#39;t Ukraine do what&#39;s necessary to get their citizens back?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who&#39;s saying it&#39;s necessary apart from you? Is it impossible for Ukraine to win the war conventionally without doing the same things Russia does? Again, do you think Ukraine should start making border raids to abduct Russian civilians?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>it would literally be the best option for reducing the total number of civilian captives in the war- and reducing that total would better adhere to the spirit of what the Geneva Conventions were trying to achieve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This  utilitarian mindset ignores the fact the GCs made hostage taking explicitly forbidden for a reason. There are carve-outs for proportionality concerning certain actions in the Conventions, and hostage taking does not get one. You do not want a grey area where it&#39;s allowed (and therefore encouraged) to start rounding up civilians of an opposing state so you can use them for your own benefit.

You may or may not believe in it, but it still can be a useful lever of soft power</li>\n<li>Consider the optics of it.

While Ukraine had allowed anti-government Russian groups to raid the border, they had no intention of seizing territory.

While the Russians are absolutely tearing through their manpower and armor resources, they are beginning to approach certain nexuses that are vital to the Ukrainian defense in the east.

Efforts by the Russians to take any of this territory back have already resulted in some stinging losses, and this is with almost zero footage from the Ukrainian side!\n\nOn this: \n\n>Russia is fighting a war of attrition, and being able to engage ukraine outside of its fortifications is something they love to do even if the casualty ratio favours ukraine. \n\nIf Ukraine is fighting outside of its fortifications (IE: *advancing*) and inflicting a favorable casualty ratio, that is *excellent*. To both be on the offensive *and* inflicting a significantly positive casualty ratio is part of winning wars.

This offensive comes after 10 months of constant Russian offensive actions. Their maneuver units are significantly understrength and pulling them north will cause their offensive to culminate in the east. While you could argue that Ukraine should be using these forces in the east, as I initially thought was better, it is now becoming clear that they are using lighter forces that would have previously been of little value besides meat in the east.
