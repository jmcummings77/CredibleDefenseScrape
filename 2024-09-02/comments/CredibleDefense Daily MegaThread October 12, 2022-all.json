China and India led the abstentions, which were mostly African countries who rely on Russia for food/weapons/other necessities. The votes against where the usual suspects: Russia, Nicaragua, Syria, Belarus, and the DPRK. Not exactly a coalition of the winning. Venezuela and Iran were absent for the vote. Interesting to note the Chinese and Indian abstentions. I actually don't think we'd see those instead of nay votes if those two countries felt that Russia comfortably had things in hand. Another interesting note, despite Saudi Arabia's seeming willingness to hassle the US for Russia re: oil, they voted in favor of the resolution today. Obviously, the UN GA resolutions aren't super big binding deals or anything, but I do think we can use them as a general weathervane for the diplomatic situation in the world. Russia really is looking very isolated in terms of hard support. The only bright spot for them (if it is a bright spot) is that the CSTO/Russosphere countries such as Kazahkstan mostly went for abstentions, indicating they aren't completely willing to box out Russia yet.\n\nEdit: Worth pointing out to those who are worried about the nuclear dimension here, I think this is a decent indicator of the amount of diplomatic pressure that could be leveraged on Russia should they choose to escalate directly towards nuclear weapons use. 143 countries is a lot of countries to all voice concerns at once and we have to assume that most of the abstentions would join in on that train as well.",

A lot of countries with less strings attached to Ukraine will rather get the chance to buy cheap commodities than get a \"Good boy\" pat in the back by the West.

Europe lacked the infrastructure to process gas sucking by boat. Second, Europe lacked the suppliers to replace Russia.\n\nIt seems to me that the second ended up not really being a problem. Europe has pretty well won the gas bidding wars, screwing over a lot of poorer countries in the process. They pay more, but they are able to get alternative suppliers when they need them.\n\nSo it seems to me that as long as Europe builds the infrastructure to switch to ship LNG, they can resume buying from Russia without unreasonable risk, because they'll be in a position to switch suppliers quickly.

Europe has pretty well won the gas bidding wars, screwing over a lot of poorer countries in the process. They pay more, but they are able to get alternative suppliers when they need them.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems to me that as long as Europe builds the infrastructure to switch to ship LNG, they can resume buying from Russia without unreasonable risk, because they&#39;ll be in a position to switch suppliers quickly. This is especially true if they cut back to only receiving, say, half their gas from Russia.</p>\n</div>",

Proper scandal. \n\n[Summary for October 11-12 (until 12:30)](https://notes.citeam.org/ru-dispatch-oct-11-12)\n\n>\tSummary for October 11-12 (until 12:30)\n\n>Shelling of Ukrainian cities\n\n>The Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports that on October 11, 28 cruise missiles were fired at Ukraine, of which 20 were shot down; 13 Shahid-136 barrage ammunition was also shot down (how many of them were fired is unknown). Volodymyr Zelenskyy, citing Ukrainian intelligence, said that in total Russia ordered 2,400 such drones from Iran. But it is not known how long Iran will fulfill the order.\n\n>It is also unclear why the intensity of rocket attacks has decreased significantly (more than 80 rockets were fired on Monday and only 28 on Tuesday).\n\n>On the morning of October 12, no information was received about the shelling, but an air alarm was announced in Ukraine.\n\n\n>International reaction\n\n>On October 11, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov reported that the previously promised 4 HIMARS MLRS units had already arrived in Ukraine. The Ramstein-6 conference is to be held today, where we expect additional supplies will be announced.\n\n>In response to President Zelensky's request to strengthen Ukraine's air defenses, the U.S. has already promised to supply two NASAMS air defense systems as quickly as possible.\n\n>There are photos of two IRIS-T launchers and a truck for transporting missiles. One complex includes 3 launchers, so apparently the third did not get into the frame. In total, they promised that 2 IRIS-T air defense systems would arrive in the near future.\n\n\n>On the night of October 11-12, Russian forces used incendiary ammunition near Nikopol. The exact geolocation has not been established, they may have been used outside the city (which is allowed).\n\n>More than 100 other shells from MLRS and barrel artillery were also fired. One of the shells flew into a private house, wounding a six-year-old girl and her mother.\n\n\n>In the Luhansk region, pro-Russian forces are preparing for defense: digging ditches and laying concrete pyramids designed to detain enemy armored vehicles.\n\n\n>The governor of the Belgorod region said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine shelled an electric substation in Shebekino, 2,000 people were left without electricity. At the moment, we don't know if it was shelling or some negligence or sabotage. If this act is committed by Ukraine, it is a violation of international humanitarian law.\n\n\n>Explosion on the Crimean Bridge\n\n>The FSB reported that they had identified the organizers and perpetrators of the explosion on the Crimean Bridge. They called the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Kirill Budanov the main organizer. According to investigators, the bombs were disguised as rolls of construction polyethylene film on 22 pallets with a total weight of more than 22 tons. In early August, the cargo was sent from the port of Odessa to the Bulgarian city of Ruse, after which it was transported to Georgia and then to Armenia. And already in late September or early October, the cargo was cleared in the Yerevan Transalliance terminal according to the rules of the EAEU. After that, the documentation was changed and the sender was the Armenian company GU AR G GROUP, and the recipient was the Moscow company Leader.\n\n>After that, on October 4, a two-axle DAF truck registered in Georgia entered Russia through the Upper Lars border post, where it was scanned by X-ray (the FSB published a picture), and two days later the cargo was delivered to a wholesale base in Armavir.\n\n>Further, according to the FSB investigation, the cargo documents were changed again: the sender was Ulyanovsk \"TEK-34\", and the recipient was a non-existent Crimean company. According to the department, Ukrainians Solomko and Vladimir Zloba participated in this, as well as five installed Russians. On October 6, the pallets were loaded into a three-axle truck belonging to Russian Mahir Yusubov, who went to Simferopol. This X-ray truck has not passed.\n\n>At 6:03 a.m. on October 8, an explosion was carried out.\n\n>Our team is not sure that the explosives were put in the cargo at one of the first stages, this does not directly follow from the FSB reports. It would be easiest to put and disguise an explosive device in a warehouse in Armavir.\n\n\n>The FSB has also published the results of other investigations. They detained an allegedly Ukrainian saboteur who was preparing terrorist attacks using Igla MANPADS, which he carried in a car cache from Kiev to Russia through Estonia.\n\n>In addition, they detained a citizen of Ukraine who was allegedly going to stage a terrorist attack at a logistics terminal in Bryansk. He found the components of a bomb based on an anti-tank missile with him.\n\n>Our team evaluates these shots as staged.\n\n\n>The Russian Prosecutor's Office began to give Facebook and Instagram users warnings about the inadmissibility of extremist activity.\n\n\n>In general, there has been a lull on the front line over the past two days. We believe that now any pause plays into Russia's hands. The more time you have for a break, the more you can collect, train and prepare the mobilized, the more equipment you can repair, the more kamikaze drones you can bring from Iran and remove more tanks from conservation in Belarus and bring them to Belgorod. Therefore, European countries should not insist on a ceasefire, but supply more equipment for Ukraine.\n\nAlso of interest is this breaking story:\n\n[Reuters Special Report: U.S. firm supplied networking tech to maker of Russian missiles](https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-us-firm-supplied-networking-technology-maker-feared-russian-missiles-2022-10-12/)\n\n>Extreme Networks says Reuters discovery leads it to believe its products were shipped to \"bad actors\" in Russia\n\n>Extreme Networks says it is informing U.S. authorities of export-control violation\n\n>Extreme Networks says distributor played role in \"scheme\"\n\n>Extreme Networks supplied equipment used in MMZ Avangard's office IT systems\n\n>MMZ Avangard is maker of missile used in recent Ukraine attack.",

The AW is supposed to replace the DPICM cluster munitions. Honestly I've been a bit skeptical about if it could be as effective as DPICM but it seems to have worked very well on this thin skinned vehicle.

Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskyy has repeatedly said lately that he will not negotiate with his Russian counterpart and that Ukraine is only ready to talk when Russian troops retreat from its territory.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whatever Turkey propose here will almost certainly be a non-starter, but I&#39;m still interested in what might be considered a credible starting point (and perhaps how seriously Erdogan truly views himself as a possible mediator).</p>\n</div>",

More importantly, I never said that Israel would be able to attrite down Iran's production to zero. That would be a silly claim. But, can Israel keep bombing Iran's production and storage facilities, as it already has this year, to keep Iran's ambitions in check? Absolutely. It's been demonstrated.

Because, again, Iran hasn't met Russian supply yet, despite rumors that Iran would supply Russia with the drones circulating since June (which means that conversations were probably being had before even then.) Again, if you have a credible source providing Iran's drone production pre-strikes and post-strikes, please share it. Otherwise, your claim seems facetious at best, and dishonest at worst. \n\n> And considering the number of drones Russia has ordered according to Zelensky, it's likely that they will be delivered in various shipments (with another cargo flight going to Moscow this evening).\n\nAnd this may very well happen, but until we do, perhaps the only claim we should be making is the one that both Israel and Iran have admitted to: that Israel destroyed an unspecified amount of Iranian drones, at least twice this year. Further, my main point was that any traction Iran gains through its drone ventures would only make it more of a target for Israel. It amuses me that you can't even admit to that. \n\nPatriotism is a wasted emotion.

More than Qatar, Iraq, or even Turkey. \n\nMy reasoning is this, Iran probably has the most liberal population (high education rates, large population, and a willingness to protest) of any middle east Muslim country. They had a recent revolution that overthrew the monarch (in the late 70s). And that revolution basically replaced the monarch with a theocracy. They do have a \"democratic\" constitution but in practice it is more of a one party rule. \n\nThe reason I say that Iran is probably one of the best potential partners in the Middle east is this. They are probably the most similar in terms of democratic values. Now values are kind of a hard term to define, but the way I see it is this: there is a very strong liberal wing in Iran that is rising in power right now. That liberal wing would likely be very interested in \"westernizing\" in order to bring more prosperity to their country. That and the USA will probably bend over backwards to make friends with them as the USA can play Iran off of Saudi Arabia in the region for more influence. \n\nThe big challenge is there is a lot of bad blood between the two though. The USA installed the Shah in the 50s which helped result in the revolution in the late 70s, which resulted in the Iran hostage crisis. If both sides could \"get over that,\" then relations can normalize between the two countries. There are signs that it is happening. First, in the USA, a younger generation doesn't remember the hostage crisis as such a crisis. It was in the past. A result is the JCPOA, but again it was, more or less, torpedoed by the older generation. Second, the younger generation in Iran is also moving past the troubles in the 50s-80s and are dealing with the new theocracy. Essentially, they are mostly okay with \"westernizing\" in order to build out some prosperity (JCPOA is an example). We're seeing that now with the protests that are looking like they are going to be quite effective changing the course of the country, either with liberalization of policies OR a revolution. \n\nAgain, there are a lot of challenges. The USA failing in Iraq and \"terrorism\" supported by Iran. Weapons supplied to Russia by Iran. The sanctions on Iran by the USA. \n\nBut keep in mind. Iran as an ally to the USA would be huge. They have oil, a huge population, an extremely good strategic location, an extremely hard country to invade, they are a regional opposite of Saudi Arabia, and have quite a lot of influence in the Muslim world. With Russia becoming a bad ally, there will be a battle for influence between China and the USA over Iran.\n\nOh and Iran could definitely benefit from better education from USA schools, US trade relations (in terms of technology and weapons), and USA infrastructure expertise. \n\nSo yeah, I'd say there are challenges, but an Iran-USA relationship would be a huge win for both countries. Probably over the next couple of decades though.",

The United States, by far the leading external contributor to Ukraine\u2019s defense, is thus far continuing to provide lethal arms. But at what expense and risk?</p>\n\n<p>The United States has transferred over 6,500 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. One analyst estimates these transfers have exhausted at least one-third of DoD\u2019s supply. The United States has similarly depleted one-quarter of its Stinger missile inventory. These shortages do not only present a near-term risk to the United States\u2019 ability to continue arming Ukraine or its capacity to respond to emergent threats. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lieber.westpoint.edu/defense-production-act-assessing-ukraine-arms-shortage/\">https://lieber.westpoint.edu/defense-production-act-assessing-ukraine-arms-shortage/</a></p>\n\n<p>Reducing army stocks by hundreds of drones is by definition reduction in readiness. That&#39;s the meaning of the word. Drop your bad faith arguing please and embrace simple logic.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s enough in peace time, but control over strategic resources is another story in a conflict.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a very simple equation: US abandoned the Saudis while they were under attack -&gt; The Saudis no longer feel like they have any obligations to the US, and look for partnership elsewhere.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. has removed its most advanced missile defense system and Patriot batteries from Saudi Arabia in recent weeks, even as the kingdom faced continued air attacks from Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebels, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/6222846.html\">https://www.voanews.com/a/6222846.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Which directly lead to this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Biden fails to secure major security, oil commitments at Arab summit</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-hopes-more-oil-israeli-integration-arab-summit-saudi-2022-07-16/\">https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-hopes-more-oil-israeli-integration-arab-summit-saudi-2022-07-16/</a></p>\n</div>",

And one key thing to realise is that as soon as this conflict goes nuclear, the odds of the \u201cbest case scenario\u201d (Ukraine fully liberated to 2014 borders) drops dramatically.

Probably tanks given the accuracy, maybe also arty and ATGMs. I don\u2019t see any missiles but maybe I missed something? The Ukrainian force (multi company) is trying to cross from one field to another via a thicket. Given the force is mounted and in single line column I would suspect it\u2019s not expecting contact, else you would expect them to dismount and try a broader approach. Penetrate the woods at several points and return fire. It appears, unless I get the perspective wrong, that the Russian ambush comes via the south as well. Anyway the force tries to pass through, comes under fire, and breaks in half. Some seem to try a crossing further up, others just floor it and hope for the best. Looks like the Russians have two or three platoons by the balls, I think Glideer suggested that 4-6 vehicles may have been bagged in this little movement. \n\nIt seems like a fairly typical defensive action really. And also again why you don\u2019t see battalions move as contiguous units often. A lead platoon in a movement outside of contact is ambushed. The battalion breaks probably at company level, and then the companies break by platoon. The lead elements try to escape the ambush, the rear ones try not to waddle into it. Once they get reorganized they\u2019d (probably) try to kill the ambushes using their numbers and combined arms advantage. If the Russians are clever they bagged their prize and went home.

            "body": "I really don't know how to feel about this article. On one hand, I agree that this is an alarming and entirely possible escalation pathway. On the other hand, I think this article makes some pretty massive assumptions to get from A to B.\n\nFirst off, I don't really care for the tone here at all. It reeks of smug enlightenment, as if the author has hit upon some deeply buried secret that no one else is aware of. The assertion that anyone who warns about the legitimate risk of nuclear war is driven into the dirt with cries of appeasement is childish. That's just not what's happening. Serious experts have spoken multiple times about the serious risks of nuclear war and nobody equally serious told them to kick rocks. A few fringe experts maybe have been very bullish, but the general attitude has been one of seriously considered risk. This is clearly the case in the US government as well. The West has definitely been walking on eggshells here when it comes to supporting Ukraine. Just because the US says it doesn't see a reason to change its nuclear posture doesn't mean they aren't taking this seriously. So I'm not sure where this whole opening paragraph diatribe about the woes of being a nuclear Cassandra comes from, other than to prevent the following paragraphs of doomerism being dismissed out of hand.\n\nSecond, I get the idea that perfectly rational individuals can plunge down a pathway of rational actions that lead to destruction. I think that's a legitimate concern here. So far escalation seems to be the normal construct for this conflict. But there are major assumptions in this article. The first is that a US conventional response in the event of nuclear use will guarantee a Russian nuclear response in return. That's not a guarantee at all. At each step of this change, negotiation points exist. Adding to that, the idea that Russia would immediately launch a massive first strike in the event of a conventional war with NATO is also unrealistic. Yes, Russia is militarily outmatched, but the likelihood is using tactical nuclear weapons first to try and even up the battlefield, not just going straight to Armageddon. It's a silly protestation, I get that, it's not as if that scenario is not terrible, but I think it shows a willingness on the author's part to assume the worst. Also, if we plunge into the realm of rationality, let me provide my own little scenario: Putin and his immediate cronies are threatened existentially by the loss in Ukraine, rationally they attempt to respond with nuclear weapons to ensure survival. Equally rational individuals in Russia not immediately tied to Putin (or possibly even immediately tied to him) would realize that the rational pathway to avoid their own destruction is to eliminate Putin, so they shoot him. If we're looking at everyone as a rational actor, we have to assume that applies to people who aren't Putin as well.\n\nThird, I disagree with the analysis regarding red lines. Harsh truths, but Russia has not set any serious or clear red lines, especially in regards to nuclear weaponry. Red lines don't work if you just sort of vaguely hint at them. The cited examples are long-range missile systems near the Russian border (I assume this refers to HIMARS? Because if it refers to ATACMS we haven't provided those), the admission of Finland and Sweden to NATO, and a threat from Medvedev of all people that attacking Crimea would warrant a judgment day response. Which one of those is a serious red line? Certainly not rocket systems. Intolerable does not mean \"we will nuke\". Was it Finland and Sweden? Well, Russia objections were not so much about a terrible response as about a general decline in the security situation along the border. The article the author cites literally shows that it was not some ominous red line, Putin just said that Russia would respond symmetrically to any NATO deployments to Finland/Sweden and warned of tensions if it happened. What exactly is the red line there? Don't join NATO or we'll move troops to protect our border from you? That's just a logical response for someone who is afraid of NATO, not a red line. Finally, we get the Crimea threat. From Medvedev. This isn't a serious red line and should not be treated as such. Now if Putin came out and said the same thing, ok, maybe we'd be in red line territory, but Medvedev has been nothing but a warhawk clown this entire conflict. If we take his pronouncements seriously, we should all be dead already. We are ultimately still waiting for an actual nuclear red line from Russia. We kind of assume it's Crimea, but it hasn't been articulated (except to Elon Musk apparently, who knows?). EDIT: The one articulated red line straight from Putin is direct involvement of NATO forces in Ukraine. That's the only one I can think of as serious.\n\nIn summary, I think this article offers a prescient warning by reminding us yet again that we have to take the threat of nuclear war seriously and that we need to be prepared to course correct off a potential escalation pathway that leads us to armageddon. I assure the author and genuinely anyone else that everyone who is in a position of power is taking this seriously. I don't think the US or its allies are being flippant about Russian red lines, escalation, or overall nuclear risk. Joe Biden does not strike me as the kind of man to out of hand destroy the entire world, even through a string of rational decision-making.\n\nAs a brief post-script, the timing of this article is a little suspect. The last two days have shown a bit of a (albeit temporary) reduction in harsh nuclear rhetoric. Biden walked back is armageddon comment on CNN last night, multiple Russian statements have been issued saying that nuclear war is not on the table, and the response of both sides to the Kerch bridge strike has been relatively constrained in terms of escalation. Russia launched massive missile barrages, to be sure, but mostly for domestic consumption. And the West's response was not to send ATACMS or god knows what else, but rather to focus on mitigation of missile strikes instead, which is definitely not escalatory. So why, in the midst of all of that (including War on the Rocks foremost featured nuclear expert Michael Kofman saying but a few days ago that he felt nuclear risks were still low), does the website drop an article with an alarming headline, byline, and message?",

But one thing that I keep seeing people fail to do when they consider this issue is give Putin, Russia, or anyone in Russia agency. Instead, many people seem to only ever consider their side to have agency. And that's a mistake, because there are multiple actors involved. Why do people do it? I can't be sure, but it seems reasonable to me that it's partly because it reduces the complexity of the situation, and satisfies the natural human craving for certainty. \n\nThis hypothetical seems to make that mistake, since the only way we could know for certain what the result of a NATO action would be is if Russian's don't have agency.\n\nThe reality is that if Russia is facing defeat in Ukraine, and becomes convinced that no conventional options will prevent defeat (which is a scenario I expect we will encounter, possibly quicker than anticipated given how well the recent Ukrainian offensive went), they will have to make a decision whether to accept defeat or use nuclear weapons.\n\nIf they use nuclear weapons, then NATO will need to decide if and how to respond. And then Russia will have another choice to make. And both sides will keep making choices until either the conflict ends or there is a nuclear war. But there will never be certainty about the result.\n\nIt seems to me that one critically important goal of NATO is to avoid using nuclear weapons against Russia, because that makes it easier for Russia to proportionally respond by using nuclear weapons against NATO in response. But at the same time, considering that Russia will be responding to NATO's decisions rather than acting in a vacuum, it is also critical that NATO make decisions that convince Russia that NATO will respond to nuclear weapons used against NATO forces or land proportionally or by escalating, rather than by backing down. This is because if Russia concludes that using a nuclear weapon against NATO will result in backing down, doing that becomes the logical option. This is especially important because if the true NATO response is nuclear annihilation and we mislead Russia into thinking our response is surrender, we get the worst possible outcome.\n\nSo let's suppose that Russia just used a nuclear weapon against Ukraine. What NATO response is most likely to convince Russia that using nuclear weapons against NATO will result in a nuclear exchange?\n\n(1) Nuking Russia. This would probably be very persuasive when it comes to NATO's resolve. But it carries with it a high risk of a nuclear exchange because Russia has the same incentive as NATO, which is to make it clear that nuking them is unacceptable. So I consider that a bad idea.\n\n(2) Direct conventional military assistance to Ukraine. This is a probably the most severe response we can offer without going nuclear. As a more severe response, it demonstrates our resolve to a greater extent than the options below. In that way, it is safer than less escalatory options, which would increase the risk that Russia mistakenly concludes that using nuclear weapons against NATO would result in NATO backing down. However, it is also more dangerous because it moves us up the escalation ladder more quickly - the only likely Russian responses would be responding with nukes or accepting defeat.\n\n(3) Indirect conventional military assistance to Ukraine. Something like sending ATACMS and Abrams. The advantage here is that we haven't moved as far up the escalation ladder - Russia could respond by, say, nuking Ukraine more instead of nuking NATO, or nuking Ukrainian population centers instead of or in additional to nuking the Ukrainian military. The risk in this response is that it is quite far from a proportional response, and therefore increases the risk that Russia will conclude NATO, and probably more specifically the US, is bluffing. Russia might respond by nuking a military distribution center in Poland, theorizing that the US would back down, Poland would call for war, and NATO would fracture while Russia completed their conquest of Ukraine.\n\n(4) Nonmilitary responses, such as sanctions. This is a more extreme version of 3. It works better than 3 because it keeps us further down the escalation ladder. It works worse than 3 because it signals even more timidity, increasing the odds that Russia concludes NATO will back down.\n\nObviously there are layers on complexity beyond each of these examples - NATO could respond with primarily air assets for example, which would make it less practical to use nukes against NATO assets in Ukraine, and force Russia to make the more difficult choice of whether or not to nuke NATO bases the planes were coming from. Or they could use ground troops, which increases the odds that NATO troops get nuked but decreases the chances that NATO territory gets nuked. Or NATO could do something like pledge to provide Ukraine with one nuke of an equivalent type to use as it pleased for every nuke that Russia used. The messaging involved would also potentially change the way each action would be perceived by Russia.\n\nBut the key thing is, both sides are making decisions at each step of the way. Treating Russia like a preprogrammed computer that only responds in known ways and only responds to escalation ignores the reality, which is that Russian decisions are made based on their perceptions of NATO, and failure to escalate can be just as or more dangerous than escalation.",

While that's a breach of Article 5, it would be non-nuclear, and thus provide NATO with an out from further ascent up the nuclear ladder. From there, I could see NATO opting to go with your original recommendation which would be to hold steady, forego further kinetic responses while continuing/ intensifying supplies to Ukraine as a show of resolve (while also signaling that direct intervention will result only from further nuclear use). In such a scenario the war continues on, but nuclear use has resulted in, at best, limited to negative gains for Russia and deterrence is re-established.\n\nBut again, that's one (optimistic scenario) based on nothing but my own assumptions and flawed analysis.

The nuclear taboo is hugely important, and once breached, it will be a dangerous (but necessary, in my view) business to ensure it is not fundamentally shattered.\n\n**On your second point:** This is the million dollar question. I see there as being **three things** that need to be true to keep the risk of nuclear weapons use to a minimum.\n\n**1) Efforts are made to ensure off-ramps exist, even if they are not taken.** If NATO is not leaving room for a parachute, then I would expect that they must be reasonably confident that Putin's order would not be carried out (e.g. a palace coup is imminent). In lieu of a coup, Putin's ability to exit the war and save face domestically will always be preferable to Putin in a corner. At least when it comes to minimizing nuclear risk.\n\n**2) Putin stands to gain no direct tactical benefit from the use of nuclear weapons.** This is, arguably, always true. But through a combination of a guaranteed NATO response (likely kinetic), increased arms support to Ukraine, and a dearth of tactically advantageous targets, I think it's fair to say Putin knows he won't benefit \"on the battlefield\" from nuclear use.\n\n**3) Putin stands to gain no strategic benefit through the use of nuclear weapons.** This is really the big one. While Putin is likely deterred from using nuclear weapons for direct tactical benefit, he may still believe he can benefit strategically - perhaps by creating a global crisis on par with the Cuban missile crisis - to extract gains as the west scrambles to de-escalate. More locally, he may feel that Ukraine's resolve would be shaken by the death of Zelensky, for example, or the partial destruction of a populous city (or cities).  The urge to \"end the war\" may become stronger than the urge to guarantee a complete Ukrainian victory. \n\nHere, I think the international community will play a big role.

Putin should be made to understand that 1) such flexibility exists, and 2) the benefit of maintaining a conventional posture outweighs the costs of attempting to widen this flexibility through nuclear use.

                "body": "Your absolutism is misplaced.\n\nPushing into Crimea poses a legitimate risk of nuclear escalation because it has been under de facto Russian control for over 8 years now. You avoid legitimizing nuclear blackmail *in the moment* but you also risk initiating a chain of escalation that you might not be able to follow through with to nuclear annihilation. If Ukraine pushes into Crimea and Russia responds with a tactical nuclear weapon, then not responding with full conventional NATO reprisal would provide far stronger legitimization than before. If Russia responds to conventional conflict with NATO within Ukrainian borders (setting aside the potential for direct attacks on NATO countries) with another tactical nuclear weapon, that escalates further with the same issue, et cetera. Your hope is that Putin is bluffing. What if you're wrong? All that is being asked is consideration, which is startling absent on the internet these days.\n\nEdit: Personally, I think that if Ukraine can push Russia out of all but Crimea, they should fortify the land connection, give the civilian population the chance to flee, and keep the Black Sea fleet at arms length with anti-ship missiles if they have enough to do so. They could blow the bridge, too, if capable. This would make it very expensive for Russia to maintain its hold on Crimea without crossing the riskiest threshold of the war.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Your absolutism is misplaced.</p>\n\n<p>Pushing into Crimea poses a legitimate risk of nuclear escalation because it has been under de facto Russian control for over 8 years now. You avoid legitimizing nuclear blackmail <em>in the moment</em> but you also risk initiating a chain of escalation that you might not be able to follow through with to nuclear annihilation. If Ukraine pushes into Crimea and Russia responds with a tactical nuclear weapon, then not responding with full conventional NATO reprisal would provide far stronger legitimization than before. If Russia responds to conventional conflict with NATO within Ukrainian borders (setting aside the potential for direct attacks on NATO countries) with another tactical nuclear weapon, that escalates further with the same issue, et cetera. Your hope is that Putin is bluffing. What if you&#39;re wrong? All that is being asked is consideration, which is startling absent on the internet these days.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Personally, I think that if Ukraine can push Russia out of all but Crimea, they should fortify the land connection, give the civilian population the chance to flee, and keep the Black Sea fleet at arms length with anti-ship missiles if they have enough to do so. They could blow the bridge, too, if capable. This would make it very expensive for Russia to maintain its hold on Crimea without crossing the riskiest threshold of the war.

Powell's final analysis was that tactical nuclear weapons were impractical on the battlefield.

Remember that it does not have an internal weapons bay, so everything you put on it increases both weight and drag, and is also subject to all the thermal stresses of flying at that speed for the entire flight. Remember that the SR-71 had a special system to cool the aircraft's skin in order to deal with the heat for hours on end, no bomb is designed to handle it. And then, consider that when you lose speed due to drag or to try to help the bombs cope, you lose lift. A lot of lift. A subsonic aircraft that can fly at that altitude looks like the U-2, these high speed aircraft need their speed to get any lift up there. Plus you've added a bunch of extra weight to the aircraft which would pull it down anyway. And adding weight means adjusting trim to generate more lift at the expense of increasing induced drag, and then you lose even more speed and even more lift, and so it goes. You won't get anything like that performance with a bomb load, it will still be a high speed high altitude aircraft but it won't be operating at the extreme performance advertised. And then you have to actually hit something from up there too, remembering that adding more bombs reduces the required accuracy but also reduces performance even further. And the entire project relies on Ukraine running out of S-300's which there isn't any evidence that they're likely to do. And if they did they still have fighters, which might not be able to directly match the speed or altitude of the Mig-31 but could get into its path and into missile range. I don't think it's a serious concern.",
