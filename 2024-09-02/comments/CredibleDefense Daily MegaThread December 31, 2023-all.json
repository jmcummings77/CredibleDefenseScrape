      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

In the Robotyne Salient, where can the Ukrainians even place a stout defense? Basically old Russian positions. \n\nSome salients are based on a single key piece of terrain that at least is locally defendable, but that's not the case with the Robotyne Salient. They can't even really take advantage of any existing structures in Robotyne itself or surrounding villages or farms, the ground is so heavily fought over at this point they're mostly destroyed. Even the treelines will have been largely stripped of living trees due to heavy use of fires. And due to the proximity to the Russians, and heavy ISR threat, digging in is really limited to shovel work by infantrymen hoping a sniper or drone doesn't take them out. \n\nAnd pretty much forget about laying more mines, minus rocket propelled remote mine-laying, which Ukraine is limited with. Or creating other new obstacles.\n\nThen comes the difficulty supplying them. The lines are curved and long and under pretty heavy attack, so the UAF need to maximize combat power within the salient but ore units but how are they being supplied? How are their casualties evacuated? When salients are narrow, like the Robotyne Salient, they have limited supply lines going in and out (the Ukrainians have access to a single hardball road leading to Robotyne itself, the rest are improvised dirt roads), making them more vulnerable to interdiction, not to mention mud. \n\nA big worry with small salients is ISR, a single drone can see so much of the overall frontage, plus into the rear.. With heavy coverage, 24/7, it means anyone, a dismount or a vehicle that is exposed and stationary and especially moving inside the salient can potentially be spotted and targeted by fires, which can include arty barrages, PGM arty, glide bombs FPV drones. With the prevalence of FPV drones, that means moving targets like vehicles can be hit too.\n\nThe counter these threats means more units to strengthen the line with more bodies and firepower. More replacement troops to replace casualties. Much more arty to make up for the poor tactical situation with better support. More EW to negate the drone threat, more SHORAD too. More everything.\n\nAs for voluntarily retreating, no way. It'll never happen.",

Basically old Russian positions. </p>\n\n<p>Some salients are based on a single key piece of terrain that at least is locally defendable, but that&#39;s not the case with the Robotyne Salient. They can&#39;t even really take advantage of any existing structures in Robotyne itself or surrounding villages or farms, the ground is so heavily fought over at this point they&#39;re mostly destroyed. Even the treelines will have been largely stripped of living trees due to heavy use of fires. And due to the proximity to the Russians, and heavy ISR threat, digging in is really limited to shovel work by infantrymen hoping a sniper or drone doesn&#39;t take them out. </p>\n\n<p>And pretty much forget about laying more mines, minus rocket propelled remote mine-laying, which Ukraine is limited with. Or creating other new obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>Then comes the difficulty supplying them. The lines are curved and long and under pretty heavy attack, so the UAF need to maximize combat power within the salient but ore units but how are they being supplied? How are their casualties evacuated? When salients are narrow, like the Robotyne Salient, they have limited supply lines going in and out (the Ukrainians have access to a single hardball road leading to Robotyne itself, the rest are improvised dirt roads), making them more vulnerable to interdiction, not to mention mud. </p>\n\n<p>A big worry with small salients is ISR, a single drone can see so much of the overall frontage, plus into the rear.. With heavy coverage, 24/7, it means anyone, a dismount or a vehicle that is exposed and stationary and especially moving inside the salient can potentially be spotted and targeted by fires, which can include arty barrages, PGM arty, glide bombs FPV drones. With the prevalence of FPV drones, that means moving targets like vehicles can be hit too.</p>\n\n<p>The counter these threats means more units to strengthen the line with more bodies and firepower. More replacement troops to replace casualties. Much more arty to make up for the poor tactical situation with better support. More EW to negate the drone threat, more SHORAD too. More everything.</p>\n\n<p>As for voluntarily retreating, no way. It&#39;ll never happen.</p>\n</div>",

A bit more pressure from the current Russian counterattacks and the Ukrainians will likely be pushed back into or past the low ground draws directly east of Robotyne, which means the UAF defense will be hinged on various north-south treeline hasty defenses east of Robotyne and the village itself doing a near hedgehog defense, having to hold over a 180 angle. \n\nRobotyne is going to end up as the chief tactical stronghold of the salient soon. That means most supply will run through it, and the rest of the various company and platoon sized defensive positions will branch out from it. It is roughly equal in height as the Russian held territory to the west and south, but it dominates the ground to the southeast to northeast, which is why it was so critical to capture in the first place.* \n\nI'm sure it already is, but as it's importance grows, and due to its proximity to the forward line (only a couple hundred meters from the western edge of the village), it's going to get hammered by Russian ISTAR directed fires. There is a good chance it'll become a meatgrinder position for the Ukrainian troops to hold, another of those really bad tactical positions that basically means a very high chance of becoming a casualty that'll chew up battalions on a weekly basis. \n\nAnd because there is only one real road leading it, so close to the zero line, doing a relief in place (RIP) is going to be a bitch. Since the Russians are notorious at this point for launching attacks or major fire missions during RIPs, I'd not want to be a UAF soldier tasked with defending that area. \n\nI never said it out loud before because I didn't want to jinx them, but I thought the Robotyne Salient was a more worthwhile target for a concerted Russian attack than the Avdiivka Salient. Now it looks like that started. Can't say I'm surprised. Not only is it ripe for attack, taking it will be a huge slap in the face to the UA govt and military. \n\n\n*After months of sifting through info, it's my opinion that the Tavria Operational Strategic Grouping of Forces' plan called for the 47th Mech Brigade to use the roughly north-south draw between Robotyne and Verbove as their chief avenue of approach to bypass both villages, take them by outflanking them, and to penetrate the first of the known \"Surovikin Lines,\" at which point they'd also outflank Novoprokopivka too.\n\nSomeone at least at the Tavria HQ designated that whole area as a gap in the Russian defenses; so the idea was that if the 47th breached the existing \"security line\" immediately south of the H08 highway, it would be smooth sailing onward driving through gaps in the defenses and hitting the flanks of unsuspecting Russian positions to roll them up, which is likely why they thought they'd trigger a Russian panic and rout. Hence why Robotyne was a Day 1 objective, and subsequent forces weren't supposed to be committed until much further south.\n\nBut the reality was they actually drove straight into a fire sack kill zone for Russian ATGM teams and forward observers calling in arty from positions in both towns, especially Robotyne, while the whole draw was filled with minefields the UAF planners didn't think were present. Because they didn't consider any minefields minus those near the H08 road, their organic engineer support with the assault forces weren't prepared to continuously breach minefields at pretty much every treeline and open field they encountered. \n\nAnd because they didn't coordinate the attack very well, Robotyne wasn't suppressed by fires as the 47th drove through the draw, so it got hammered on its flanks with ATGMs, hit by Russian arty, and then engaged by KA-52 attack helicopters while it tried to negotiate minefields that weren't supposed to exist.

PRC/CCP/PLA didn't have enough boats then to want to have a naval base anywhere and definitely not in Taiwan.  Similar for the semiconductor industry/TSMC.  There were no semiconductor industry in 1949 and definitely no TSMC to loot in 1949.  Yet PRC wanted to unify.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that PRC's sovereign territory claim is legit but to say that the primary motive for wanting Taiwan is/was something other than political - not to dissimilar to how/why PRC took over Tibet or HongKong - is not correct.

PRC/CCP/PLA didn&#39;t have enough boats then to want to have a naval base anywhere and definitely not in Taiwan.  Similar for the semiconductor industry/TSMC.  There were no semiconductor industry in 1949 and definitely no TSMC to loot in 1949.  Yet PRC wanted to unify.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that PRC&#39;s sovereign territory claim is legit but to say that the primary motive for wanting Taiwan is/was something other than political - not to dissimilar to how/why PRC took over Tibet or HongKong - is not correct.
