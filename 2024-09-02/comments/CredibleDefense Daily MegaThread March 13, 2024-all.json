            "body": ">  it will start drafting women into its military to help counter an increased threat from Russia.\n\nI really don't understand why more countries don't pursue this option. Even if you exclude women from frontline infantry roles where physical strength is arguably important and the case against gender equality is strongest, there are many combat and non-combat roles where they can perform every bit as well as men, and can thus indirectly free up more personnel for the infantry. In any case, maintaining and operating drones or other remote-controlled or autonomous vehicles or munitions will play an increasingly large role in combat going forward, and there is absolutely no need for upper body strength to fulfill those duties. Eventually we may even see infantry as such disappear, with drones that are much more sophisticated than what exists today carrying out the same functions, in which case there would be absolutely no difference between men's and women's abilities to contribute to an effective fighting force. If that's the probable end state for autonomous weapons over the next few decades, it makes sense to get out ahead of it and integrate women more fully into the overall military and conscription systems sooner rather than later, so that when a country does go to war they are already prepared to maximize their recruitment base without incurring any frictions from integrating women into a traditionally male dominated organization during the war itself, hopefully avoiding the trap Ukraine finds itself in right now.",

        "body": "Kofman and company just returned from yet another field trip to Ukraine (they try to go every 3 months), and he was joined by Rob Lee to discuss some of their findings on Kofman's member's only podcast *The Russia Contingency.* As I've noted before, you can actually find these episodes for free on the \"Podcast Player\" app available on the Google Play store and it is well worth a listen. \n\nBelow are some key takeaways. \n\n* Kofman briefly explained that on these trips they try to speak with some of the best equipped and worst equipped units and everyone in between they can get in touch with, and that they don't report on things they hear that aren't corroborated by other sources. \n\n* Ukraine's 3 primary issues today are the same that they were from the last trip, and have only gotten worse since then. They are in order: manpower, fortifications, and ammunition. Each one of these issues compound the others, so fixing one doesn't make the others go away. \n\n* Kofman and Lee agree that the Ukrainian offensive went on for far too long, exhausting Ukrainian ammunition supplies and manpower, especially infantry, which they say Ukraine has effectively run out of. Infantry assaults were still being conducted in *November* (emphasis mine, this was after Russian Avdiivka offensive began in early October) using ad hoc units made up of drivers, drone operators, and other non-assault forces with predictably poor results. \n\n* Ukraine's manpower problems remain critical right now, but there's been no progress on the new mobilization law. These delays will be felt more in the coming months as it will take time to train new recruits even if it passes today. Next 2-3 months especially will be hard, but the longer manpower isn't addressed the worse things will get. Manpower will be *the* decisive factor for Ukraine in 2024. \n\n* Ukrainian battalions have a few hundred men on the books, but infantry have been suffering disproportionate losses, leading to some 300+ men battalions only having 50-60 capable infantry. \n\n* As disproportionate infantry losses lead to a breakdown in unit cohesion, Ukriane has started running into a problem these days with the fragmentation of their forces. Individual battalions from a single unit are being sent to multiple different fronts, which is leading to situations where local commanders are in charge of a motley assortment of forces similar to what the Russians were dealing with in 2022. \n\n* Russian mobilization in 2022 and recruitment efforts in 2023 have provided it with enough manpower to not only sustain and replace heavy losses, but build several new combined arms armies. The financial incentives offered by Russia allowed them to recruit somewhere around 300k volunteers last year, remains to be seen how it will shake out in 2024 but it appears to be sustainable for the time being. \n\n* Russia is using corporeal punishment including execution and the threat of execution to maintain discipline in its infantry units even despite extremely heavy losses. Multiple sources told them that Russian squad leaders are empowered to execute any Russian soldiers who break and flee or refuse orders, and that so long as those squad leaders are alive, their units will continue assaults. \n\n* Russia has both an artillery and manpower advantage on key parts of the front, which combined with prodigious use of glide bombs, has allowed recent Russian battlefield advances. \n\n* Kofman admits he was wrong about the effectiveness of Russian recruitment efforts, acknowledging that Russia was able to replace losses, build new formations, and conduct major offensives without needing to conduct another wave of mobilization. He also suggests he thought Russia would focus on building new units in order to rotate their exhausted frontline forces, especially mobik formations, but that hasn't happened. \n\n* There was a major question about the morale of Russian forces in late 2022 and throughout 2023, with many noting that it was poor. But there have been many examples of Russian units fighting to the death after being encircled, and not just elite units like VDV but motorized rifle divisions and mobik units too. Morale isn't great, but Russia has been able to keep its forces from breaking. \n\n* Russian use of glide bombs is major new development, they're dropping 30-40 per day and on peak days a lot more than that. They're also being launched from longer ranges now too (40-50km last year, now more like 60-80k). Still not particularly accurate, but they are very effective at suppressing forces and lowering morale. \n\n* Ukraine has seen some success against Russian aviation in recent weeks, notably against the crucial A-50 aircraft, but its unknown how many Su-34s they actually shot down. Not enough to cause a significant decrease in glide bomb strikes though. \n\n* They noted that small mobile Ukraine air defense teams of guys in pickup trucks with HMGs and MANPADS are a hugely important part of their defense network, especially CUAV, and a topic they'd like to do a deep dive on at a later time. These units have a deficit of interceptors however, much like the military is suffering from shell hunger overall. \n\n* As they have noted previously, unlike Russia, Ukraine doesn't have dedicated engineering units and its a brigade-level military. Therefore, while brigades build decent fortifications close to the front, they often have no fallback positions as no one is building behind them. This lack of depth is what led to the fall of Avdiivka. \n\n* Ukraine is making some progress, belatedly, on the fortifications front. They've run into issues with getting permission to build on private property and from local governments that they're working to address. \n\n* New Ukrainian defensive positions are unlikely to look like Russian Surovikin Line, with its continuous lines of fortifications, but instead be more localized around key defensive features and less fully cohesive due to the structure of Ukrainian military. Should still be a major improvement over current lines however. \n\n* They repeatedly pointed out how difficult (and diplomatically pointed out how stupid) a Ukrainian fall offensive would be considering Ukraine's deficit of munitions, lack of manpower (which still hasn't been addressed), and the poor results of the last offensive. \n\n* **Lee: \"My concern right now though is that the trajectory is not positive for Ukraine. And if the manpower issue is not fixed, there are significant risks later this year... I don't want to be alarmist here, but it's possible that a similar situation that Russia faced at Kharkiv in September 2022 is something that Ukraine could face a few months from now. Maybe in the Summer, maybe in the Fall if these issues are not addressed.\"** \n\n* Kofman tried to sound a bit more upbeat in response, noting that Ukraine's leadership is aware of the problems, that Ukraine has new military leadership and that there are significant new changes on the horizon including changes to command structures and brigade commanders as well as the Ukrainian military writ large. He says he walked away from the trip with \"a relatively balanced picture\" with significant concerns, but more knowledge on how Ukraine is looking to tackle its problems. \n\n* Part two of the discussion will focus on logistics, maintenance, and the drone war as well as a continuation of the conversation.",

It's insane to me to that Ukraine is fighting an existential war and risking a collapse because of lack of manpower when they exempt 18-27 year old men from conscription, not to mention other liberal exemptions and failings to crack down on draft dodging.  Some plausible reasons that I can think of:\n\n1. Political dysfunction:  As an American, I have become all too well aware of the failings of democratic leaders and parties to efficiently and effectively govern, even in times of crisis.\n\n2.  Public unpopularity:  Last polls I've seen, Ukrainians overwhelmingly approved Zelensky and Ukrainian military, supported continued resistance to Russian aggression, and opposed even concessions like formal relinquishment of Crimea in any peace treaty.  So you'd think there would be support for what's necessary to have a chance to accomplish those goals.  Perhaps mobilizing the men necessary to fight the war would lead to massive internal strife, men fleeing Ukraine like we saw in Russia when it partially mobilized, and political chaos.  Like democratic leadership can fail, sometimes the problem is with the public itself unrealistically wanting something but not willing to pay the necessary price.  \n\n3.  Money/Resources:  It doesn't do much good to mobilize a few hundred thousand men if you can't train, pay, and equip them.  Obviously, US financial support has dried up at least for the time being and I'm not sure if Europe is willing to step up in its place.  Besides the cost of training, paying, and equipping more men, there's the additional cost of removing them from armaments producing or economically productive or jobs, and the risk of thousands of others fleeing the country and their economically productive jobs.  No government is going to survive if it can't meet payroll.  \n\n4.  Lack of manpower:  This is simply not the answer unless I am totally misunderstanding the facts.  By my eyeball estimate of [Ukraine's population pyramid for 2023](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F1tt5bs6zthra1.jpg&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=CredibleDefense&utm_content=t1_kh3pmry) (and I believe this is from the pessimistic UN estimate of Ukraine's current population), there's about 1.2 million Ukrainian men between the ages of 20-29 with another 2.8 million between the ages of 30-39. There's also another 150,000+ annually turning 20 over the next few years with that number increasing every subsequent year.  Add in a few hundred thousand who are currently in uniform as border guard, special police, territorial defense, and such like who mostly do rear security and could be pressed into combat roles.  There absolutely should be adequate manpower to mobilize the necessary 100, 200, or even 300,000 men needed to fill out the combat slots currently open, and provide for an additional ongoing supply of men in years following.",

If so, why should they trust him now? </p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, he&#39;s an elected official who ran as a popularist and is still trying to rule by popular concept. But that&#39;s not what Ukraine needs, they need true leadership, and often that means having to tell the truth, even if its not appealing.

Was noted back last September when a company in the 47th Mech Bde mutinied when they were being reassigned, which was revealed by Ukrainian journalists and UAF soldiers posting on Facebook.\n\nNot controversial in March 2024. \n\n>b) Fragmenting formations and using their individual units spread all across the country.\n\nThey've been doing that since day 1. It's just how they fight. They must do it because they don't have enough brigades. They can't create more because they don't have enough people to mobilize. Something that has been talked about extensively since last summer.\n\nIn mid November Zelensky said he wanted a legislative plan delivered to him in one week to fix the mobilization crisis. Four months ago...\n\n>c) Neglecting the construction of fortifications due to a lack of dedicated engineering units over two years after the war started.\n\nThis discussion didn't start until after the offensive failed and the Russian counteroffensive started, specifically in [Late November 2023](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-calls-fortifications-key-frontline-areas-2023-11-30/). That's been talked about ad nauseam since then by basically everyone. The issue isn't that they didn't think about it, it's that they thought about them too late and what they've done so far isn't enough.\n\nAnd yet, and I mention this in nearly every post I can, they can't build stout defenses on the existing front lines or immediately close, they've got to be outside common artillery and FPV drone range because there is no way to dig the fortifications, lay reinforced concrete, dig long tank ditches, lay dragons teeth, plant extensive minefields while in contact with the enemy, under drone observation, and within range of all tactical fires. That's why the Surovikin Line are about 10 km back from the front lines. The only way to get the existing front lines better built is when it's a quiet sector and there is no counter-engineer ops being done to target the engineering efforts (which is how the Russians were able to build the Robotyne defenses and elsewhere right in front of the UAF).",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>a) Throwing support forces (drone operators, drivers) into infantry assaults long after the offensive has clearly failed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Already given as one of the justifications to create an entirely new branch of the UAF to control drones. Was noted back last September when a company in the 47th Mech Bde mutinied when they were being reassigned, which was revealed by Ukrainian journalists and UAF soldiers posting on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Not controversial in March 2024. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>b) Fragmenting formations and using their individual units spread all across the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They&#39;ve been doing that since day 1. It&#39;s just how they fight. They must do it because they don&#39;t have enough brigades. They can&#39;t create more because they don&#39;t have enough people to mobilize. Something that has been talked about extensively since last summer.</p>\n\n<p>In mid November Zelensky said he wanted a legislative plan delivered to him in one week to fix the mobilization crisis. Four months ago...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>c) Neglecting the construction of fortifications due to a lack of dedicated engineering units over two years after the war started.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This discussion didn&#39;t start until after the offensive failed and the Russian counteroffensive started, specifically in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-calls-fortifications-key-frontline-areas-2023-11-30/\">Late November 2023</a>. That&#39;s been talked about ad nauseam since then by basically everyone. The issue isn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t think about it, it&#39;s that they thought about them too late and what they&#39;ve done so far isn&#39;t enough.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, and I mention this in nearly every post I can, they can&#39;t build stout defenses on the existing front lines or immediately close, they&#39;ve got to be outside common artillery and FPV drone range because there is no way to dig the fortifications, lay reinforced concrete, dig long tank ditches, lay dragons teeth, plant extensive minefields while in contact with the enemy, under drone observation, and within range of all tactical fires. That&#39;s why the Surovikin Line are about 10 km back from the front lines.

        "body": "An article that contains a summary of the air raids conducted by Ukraine over the past couple nights.  If the reports are believed it is the largest air raid Ukraine has been able to conduct to date.  Their capability continues to grow and with pledged support this is one of the few capabilities that might improve over 2024.\n\nTo me one of the more interesting things mentioned is the mix and match of what is launched together for a certain raid.  \"along with a wave of drones, Ukrainian gunners on Tuesday launched eight RM-70 rockets and one Tochka-U missile at targets in the region.\"  Why that grouping specifically?  Simply resources available or is that combo sent together for specific reasons?  \n\n[Dozens of Drones Bombard Russian Oil Refineries in Record Air Raids | Kyiv Post | March 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/29453)\n\n*Dozens of attack drones swarmed over west Russia on Wednesday to hit infrastructure targets in Kyiv\u2019s most ambitious air assaults to date against its powerful eastern neighbor. The Ukrainian robot planes aimed mostly at energy infrastructure and in some attacks struck hundreds of kilometers deep into Russia, in a second wave of two days of air raids.*\n\n*Overnight Monday-Tuesday, according to Kremlin reports, Ukrainian forces launched around 30-40 weapons including drones, artillery rockets and a ballistic missile. Targets included refining infrastructure, the power grid and air defenses. According to army statements from Russia\u2019s western Belgorod region, along with a wave of drones, Ukrainian gunners on Tuesday launched eight RM-70 rockets and one Tochka-U missile at targets in the region.*\n\n*The most damaging attack in the first wave of strikes appeared to hit the Norsi oil refinery outside the city of Nizhny Novgorod. News agencies reported a major fire cut production at the plant, responsible for six percent of all processed crude products in the Russian Federation, in half. The facility is about 900 km. away from probable Ukrainian launch sites.*\n\n*Another Tuesday drone attack hit a production facility about 450 km miles east of Moscow, in one of the longest-ranged Ukrainian air raids into Russia of the entire war, with unreported results.

The Ukrainian robot planes aimed mostly at energy infrastructure and in some attacks struck hundreds of kilometers deep into Russia, in a second wave of two days of air raids.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Overnight Monday-Tuesday, according to Kremlin reports, Ukrainian forces launched around 30-40 weapons including drones, artillery rockets and a ballistic missile. Targets included refining infrastructure, the power grid and air defenses. According to army statements from Russia\u2019s western Belgorod region, along with a wave of drones, Ukrainian gunners on Tuesday launched eight RM-70 rockets and one Tochka-U missile at targets in the region.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The most damaging attack in the first wave of strikes appeared to hit the Norsi oil refinery outside the city of Nizhny Novgorod. News agencies reported a major fire cut production at the plant, responsible for six percent of all processed crude products in the Russian Federation, in half. The facility is about 900 km. away from probable Ukrainian launch sites.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Another Tuesday drone attack hit a production facility about 450 km miles east of Moscow, in one of the longest-ranged Ukrainian air raids into Russia of the entire war, with unreported results. A fuel depot in the city of Oryol, about 160 km east of the Russo-Ukrainian border, was hit on Tuesday morning as well.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>A Kremlin Wednesday morning statement said Russian air defense units from late night Tuesday through Wednesday morning shot down at least 58 Ukrainian strike aircraft including 11 drones over Russia\u2019s Belgorod Region, 8 over the Bryansk Region, 29 over the Voronezh Region, 8 over the Kursk Region, and a single robot plane each over the Ryazan and Leningrad Regions.

The quantity of RM-70 rockets launched (which for context is an improved, heavier version of the Grad MLRS designed and built by the Czechs, with 40 122mm rockets that have an approximately 20km range per load) seems like a single limited salvo launched at a single target near the front, because eight rockets is only one fifth of its full 40 rocket volley and the range on its 122mm rockets isn't directly useful for deep operations like those for which the drones were employed. Same idea goes for the Tochka. Alternatively, if there is a relationship between the strikes, the 122mm rockets and Tochka may have been targeting critical nodes in the Russian air defense to help open routes to the Russian deep rear for the much larger number of drones to then route through and exploit.",

The aforementioned volunteers, conscripts (who have been ambushed by Ukrainian saboteurs several times in the past), several regiments of the Territorial Forces (usually those of the 3xx-th series) and some smaller regular units, such as the new 263rd Motorized Brigade and several battalions of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps and of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA.

In addition, since early February 2024, elements of the new 116th Special Purpose Brigade of the Rosgvardia have been moved from the interior of Donetsk Oblast to the state border along Belgorod Oblast, according to the Ukrainian observer Mashovets.

It consists of the 900th, 901st and 902nd Operational Regiments, each with about 2000 men - the bulk of the 902nd along with elements of the other two regiments were transferred to Belgorod, totaling about 2300 men, about 15 T-80BVs and over a hundred among BMPs and BTRs.

Conscripts are also deployed in Crimea.\n\nAnd from what I know, training takes place normally, and at the bases of regular brigades and regiments there is usually a battalion of conscripts, perhaps with a tank company and so on.

The one video I saw indicated some level of terminal guidance - a drone made a few maneuvers and then dove into a tower.

With Trump threatening to end the careers of Reps who pass this bill, I'm curious to see if it will happen.\n\nThat threat will be ineffective against anyone who intends to retire after this term, and there may be more Republican resignations coming up. https://www.newsweek.com/ken-buck-teases-more-republican-resignations-coming-1878601\n\nI am certain many Republicans in the House are deeply troubled by Trump's interference with the conduct of ordinary, uncontroversial business, even when they agree with his positions. Trump is basically setting a new standard where the House will no longer be able to conduct *any* business at all for an entire year during a presidential election year, far beyond the more recent standard that the House avoids anything controversial in the 6-10 months before the election while still keeping the lights on. Historically it's been a sort of ceasefire that both sides silently consent to in order to avoid complicating their own individual elections with the unpredictable results of large scale or highly controversial legislation. The election year pause has never amounted to an intentional effort to undermine the sitting president by denying his party the ability to conduct ordinary, uncontroversial business in an explicit effort to tank the country so people vote against the incumbent.\n\nThis new standard effectively means we would not have a functioning government 25% of the time and would historically have been considered insane and unthinkable. And really ought to be considered the same way still, yet somehow here we are. Luckily, there are many in the Republican party that recognize and oppose such insanity, and voters are not so stupid that they will miss all this very public drama where Trump is actively working to hurt the country to improve his own electoral chances. Even low information voters will hear about it and there is a substantial chance the strategy will backfire. In the meantime, a decent number of individual Republican members of the House are reaching the ethical, political, and practical limits of their willingness to go along with Trump's antics, and are considering resigning or retiring. Trump thus may achieve the previously unimaginable and lose the Republican House majority *without an election even having to occur*.",

One of the big uses for those types of drones is short range artillery-type functions. The US literally has almost twice as many mortars as Ukraine has artillery to serve that function. Meaning that the US even without air power can bring a lot of fire onto static defenses, making them weaker for the follow up combined force arms breach. That's because CBF breaches are the hardest thing to do, and the US wants to make it as easy as possible.\n\nBut to counter drones specifically, there are a number of solutions that the US uses. \n\nTwo that aren't used in Ukraine a lot even though they are available are EW and smoke for concealment. The reason is the same: Ukraine is as dependent on drones as Russia is. They use them for spotting enemies, observing their own forces for command/control, and correcting artillery fire. EW and smoke hinders as much as it helps. The US doesn't rely on drones that are as susceptible to EW and doesn't use them for C&C. So both options would be used much more than in Ukraine. \n\nOtherwise, the solutions the US has are much like what Ukraine has, but just more of them. They would use MANPADs, but also VSHORAD systems.
