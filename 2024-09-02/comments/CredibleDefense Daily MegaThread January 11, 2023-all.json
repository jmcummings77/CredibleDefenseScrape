But it turned into a disaster. Within 4-5 days of the Russians reaching the outer edge of the city (from three directions) they'd already pushed to the factory area (huge) in the western side. Then they brought in many TDF reinforcements, including International Legion, and counterattacked, partially retaking back some of the city. At that point Zelensky and others started talking up Severodonetsk's importance, despite it really having none, and that it's fate was tied to the Donbas, which would have sounded awesome in historical retrospect if the UAF had won, but within a few days they were again pushed to the western edge. That created a stalemate period that lasted for another week before the Russians used PGMs to destroy the last bridge, at which point the UAF organized and carried out a retreat to the much much much better ground of Lysychansk.\n\nThat brings us to the third week of June, by which point the Russians had already breached the lines at multiple locations of the southern part of the Ukrainian salient, thus endangering the 4-5 brigades worth of UAF forces deeper in the salient, such as those still holding Lysychansk and the Donets river line, which caused an operational withdrawal back to the Siversk-Bakhmut line, which is still largely intact seven months later.\n\nThe current fight is being done with better UAF units, better support (including two separate artillery brigades, a MAJOR force multiplier), and defended in depth. Unlike Severodonetsk, Bakhmut actually does have tactical and operational value, though not as much as many assume because there is high ground immediately west of Bakhmut that already has defenses built that'll prevent a major withdrawal to Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka, so losing Bakhmut itself doesn't mean an operational level emergency happens along with needing to retreat and give up anything besides the city.\n\nThe only daunting thing is the Russians have the initiative again in this location. They are forcing the Ukrainians to either commit to a costly battle of attrition or else lose the city. Ukraine doesn't need to agree, they can conduct a maneuver defense there to husband forces while concentrating forces elsewhere to remain staunchly on the offensive. \n\nBut it's still not like Severodonetsk, a battle that shouldn't really have occurred at all. Severodonetsk should not have been contested, not when so many other sectors in the Donbas were hurting for troops. A situation Ukraine doesn't necessarily face right now.",

Then they retreat from Zaitseve. Each retreat was orderly, with the approaches heavily mined and took the Russians some time to clear up.\n\nAhh, things are clear now.. You just don't know what a maneuver defense is. You have no clue what this discussion is about and yet are eagerly denouncing it as Russian propaganda.\n\nI never said the Ukrainians didn't retreat, obviously they did considering the Russians took so much territory. The difference between a maneuver defense and a positional defense is WHEN the retreat happens and why. A maneuver defense is characterized by... maneuver. The defender sticks and moves, performs hit and run ambush centric tactics at an operational level, retreats BEFORE being decisively engaged, counterattacks at every opportunity. \n\nPositional defense with the political objective to hold at all costs means retreats aren't authorized until the defenders are either pushed out, outflanked, rendered combat ineffective without the ability to be relieved in place, or the territory they're defending is destroyed to the point it loses the political value that made it so critical to defend in the first place.\n\nWhen facing an enemy whose situation (especially communications, command and logistics) and a doctrine has them sucking at maneuver but excelling at fires centric positional set piece battles, maneuver is better than static. When fighting a slow, out of shape boxer with an incredibly hard punch, DON'T STAY IN ONE PLACE TO GET HIT. \n\n>Provide me with one source, any one source, where the decision to not retreat in Soledar has explicitly been linked to politics. \n\nWe'll need to wait until the next RUSI report confirms what's obvious BECAUSE THE UAF NEVER SWITCHED TO A MANEUVER DEFENSE. \n\nNews flash, the current Russian military is exponentially worse off than even the summer when the UAF brass wanted to do a maneuver defense. Why? \n\nTHE RUSSIANS CAN'T DO MANEUVER WARFARE ANYMORE\n\nTheir comms aren't secure. Their troops suck. Their junior and mid level officer corps has been gutted, to the point they basically scrapped battalions as a tactical unit due to lack of officers (also from RUSI). Their logistics is a joke and only works when they're stationary. Their fires centric tactics can't work without fully functioning supply lines. Their planning and command structure is centralized and inflexible. Meaning there is no better opponent to force into maneuver defense, force the lines to move quickly, force the Russians to have to limber up guns and move 10-15 km a day with the ammo stored everywhere a hundred km in their rear because of HIMARS, force them to talk open on their radios, force them to make decisions on the fly which their system sucks at...\n\nBut they can't, because somebody is still telling them the same thing they told them in the spring summer, maneuver defense denied, hold the ground at all cost. \n\nStick to information operations and news aggregating, you don't understand the military side of things, of which you are NOT credible.",

Then they retreat from Zaitseve. Each retreat was orderly, with the approaches heavily mined and took the Russians some time to clear up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ahh, things are clear now.. You just don&#39;t know what a maneuver defense is. You have no clue what this discussion is about and yet are eagerly denouncing it as Russian propaganda.</p>\n\n<p>I never said the Ukrainians didn&#39;t retreat, obviously they did considering the Russians took so much territory. The difference between a maneuver defense and a positional defense is WHEN the retreat happens and why. A maneuver defense is characterized by... maneuver. The defender sticks and moves, performs hit and run ambush centric tactics at an operational level, retreats BEFORE being decisively engaged, counterattacks at every opportunity. </p>\n\n<p>Positional defense with the political objective to hold at all costs means retreats aren&#39;t authorized until the defenders are either pushed out, outflanked, rendered combat ineffective without the ability to be relieved in place, or the territory they&#39;re defending is destroyed to the point it loses the political value that made it so critical to defend in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>When facing an enemy whose situation (especially communications, command and logistics) and a doctrine has them sucking at maneuver but excelling at fires centric positional set piece battles, maneuver is better than static. When fighting a slow, out of shape boxer with an incredibly hard punch, DON&#39;T STAY IN ONE PLACE TO GET HIT. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Provide me with one source, any one source, where the decision to not retreat in Soledar has explicitly been linked to politics. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll need to wait until the next RUSI report confirms what&#39;s obvious BECAUSE THE UAF NEVER SWITCHED TO A MANEUVER DEFENSE. </p>\n\n<p>News flash, the current Russian military is exponentially worse off than even the summer when the UAF brass wanted to do a maneuver defense. Why? </p>\n\n<p>THE RUSSIANS CAN&#39;T DO MANEUVER WARFARE ANYMORE</p>\n\n<p>Their comms aren&#39;t secure. Their troops suck. Their junior and mid level officer corps has been gutted, to the point they basically scrapped battalions as a tactical unit due to lack of officers (also from RUSI). Their logistics is a joke and only works when they&#39;re stationary. Their fires centric tactics can&#39;t work without fully functioning supply lines. Their planning and command structure is centralized and inflexible. Meaning there is no better opponent to force into maneuver defense, force the lines to move quickly, force the Russians to have to limber up guns and move 10-15 km a day with the ammo stored everywhere a hundred km in their rear because of HIMARS, force them to talk open on their radios, force them to make decisions on the fly which their system sucks at...</p>\n\n<p>But they can&#39;t, because somebody is still telling them the same thing they told them in the spring summer, maneuver defense denied, hold the ground at all cost. </p>\n\n<p>Stick to information operations and news aggregating, you don&#39;t understand the military side of things, of which you are NOT credible.</p>\n</div>",

                                            "body": "Back in the mid summer when it became clear to me that the Ukrainians had definitely chose not to perform a maneuver defense despite it seeming like the best choice, I thought up a few potential reasons that weren't nefarious.\n\nThe primary one I mentioned a few times in this sub was the threat of running out of time. Back in spring summer there was far less support from the west, especially in terms of a long term commitment. There was lots of talk then of potential peace talks and even Zelensky was telling the G7 summit leaders in late June that he wanted the war over by winter. If that's the case, a maneuver defense that doesn't get results quickly and can't guarantee to retake all lost ground can be dangerous if the war suddenly stops and lines are frozen. So it might be worth losing the extra troops to hold firm in the short term.\n\nOther possibilities I've thought of since include the possibility that the strategy might be bigger than Zelensky, it could be a prevailing Ukraine military brass mindset, and he was given the advice to execute it. After all they're Ukrainian, having served in the Russian and Soviet military forever, where \"hold or die\" defenses are basically tradition. Add in the realities of the Donbas War and what happened when they gave up or lost control of the certain ground becoming de facto separatist states, that could gave them extra incentive to not risk losing more. Same goes with early in this war, a lot of people in the media were suggesting the deep Russian advances were deliberately allowed by the UAF, but nope, that only happened because they weren't ready and the Russians were able to drive deep in so many sectors without serious opposition. But every time the Ukrainians could mass and fight in an organized and efficient manner, they held firm and stopped the Russians. \n\nLastly, they were embarrassed. As good as they did defending Kyiv in the first phase, they was really lucky that the Russians helped them so much attacking like idiots. But they still lost 20% of their country.

                                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Back in the mid summer when it became clear to me that the Ukrainians had definitely chose not to perform a maneuver defense despite it seeming like the best choice, I thought up a few potential reasons that weren&#39;t nefarious.</p>\n\n<p>The primary one I mentioned a few times in this sub was the threat of running out of time. Back in spring summer there was far less support from the west, especially in terms of a long term commitment. There was lots of talk then of potential peace talks and even Zelensky was telling the G7 summit leaders in late June that he wanted the war over by winter. If that&#39;s the case, a maneuver defense that doesn&#39;t get results quickly and can&#39;t guarantee to retake all lost ground can be dangerous if the war suddenly stops and lines are frozen. So it might be worth losing the extra troops to hold firm in the short term.</p>\n\n<p>Other possibilities I&#39;ve thought of since include the possibility that the strategy might be bigger than Zelensky, it could be a prevailing Ukraine military brass mindset, and he was given the advice to execute it. After all they&#39;re Ukrainian, having served in the Russian and Soviet military forever, where &quot;hold or die&quot; defenses are basically tradition. Add in the realities of the Donbas War and what happened when they gave up or lost control of the certain ground becoming de facto separatist states, that could gave them extra incentive to not risk losing more. Same goes with early in this war, a lot of people in the media were suggesting the deep Russian advances were deliberately allowed by the UAF, but nope, that only happened because they weren&#39;t ready and the Russians were able to drive deep in so many sectors without serious opposition. But every time the Ukrainians could mass and fight in an organized and efficient manner, they held firm and stopped the Russians. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, they were embarrassed. As good as they did defending Kyiv in the first phase, they was really lucky that the Russians helped them so much attacking like idiots. But they still lost 20% of their country. How much more would they be willing to keep losing? Especially needing the positive press, with Information Operations being so important, how do they sell constant Russian advances if they can&#39;t guarantee victories too? Maneuver defense isn&#39;t guaranteed to work, it&#39;s hard to execute unless forces are organized, planning is solid, and comms are spot on. It&#39;s a risk.

Russians are attacking there (have initiative), you either give ground or you fight them. Ukraine could give some kilometers here or there, but that would just mean you will have to fight tomorrow. Ukraine doesn&#39;t really have a chance to reject the Russian &quot;proposal&quot;. If Ukraine retreats from Soledar and Bakhmut in order not to spill too much blood over them. Well, then Ukraine will be spilling blood over the next geographic point.</p>\n</div>",

If you look at the current military district heads, it's Dvornikov at SMD (who still has SMD despite losing over all command), Muradov at EMD (Dvornikov's longtime deputy at SMD), Nikiforov at WMD (one of Surovikin's clique who was slotted in after the previous head had only 1 month in the job) and Linkov at CMD (Lapin's deputy, but CMD is by far the smallest and least relevant of the MDs, it's still a question whether it was even an individual command at the start of the war or whether 41st CAA was under EMD and 2nd under WMD).\n\nIn effect, prior to Gerasimov suddenly bringing operational command under the General Staff for the first time in the war, all the major commanders were either aligned with Surovikin or one of his guys. This is also the first time the central staffers have taken control of the conflict, before then it was very much in the hands of the MDs (and Serdyukov's informal airborne corps at the start of the war which was the primary force assaulting Kyiv proper).",

If you look at the current military district heads, it&#39;s Dvornikov at SMD (who still has SMD despite losing over all command), Muradov at EMD (Dvornikov&#39;s longtime deputy at SMD), Nikiforov at WMD (one of Surovikin&#39;s clique who was slotted in after the previous head had only 1 month in the job) and Linkov at CMD (Lapin&#39;s deputy, but CMD is by far the smallest and least relevant of the MDs, it&#39;s still a question whether it was even an individual command at the start of the war or whether 41st CAA was under EMD and 2nd under WMD).</p>\n\n<p>In effect, prior to Gerasimov suddenly bringing operational command under the General Staff for the first time in the war, all the major commanders were either aligned with Surovikin or one of his guys. This is also the first time the central staffers have taken control of the conflict, before then it was very much in the hands of the MDs (and Serdyukov&#39;s informal airborne corps at the start of the war which was the primary force assaulting Kyiv proper).</p>\n</div>",

Before the referenda, L/DNR apparently had their own camps and performed exchanges independently of Russia, as evidenced by those 2 captured Brits. \n\nI wondered about this after the exchanged Wagner fighter was executed with a sledgehammer. Ukraine had to have known he wouldn't be treated well and probably executed, especially since he abandoned his position on the 2nd day and told the New York Times about it.

            "body": "How the Wagner situation ends, in my view, in the long run: either Russia spins up new PMCs that are like Wagner, thus adopting a hybrid PMC / army structure, or Wagner is absorbed directly into the Russian MOD. One day, the principals (i.e. Putin) will be dead. Whatever personalist relationship the state has to Wagner will dissolve, and the group will either subsume the state or the state will subsume it. The status quo can also persist, but the long arc of history is unfriendly to independent military units outside of direct state control. It may happen in 10 years or a 1000, but I'm willing to bet that Russia will be around long after Wagner is gone.\n\nThe problem with Bakhmut meanwhile is a geographic one: it's very far down South (more km to cross), on top of Russian lines, in the dead of winter (negative Celsius most days), and with the loss of Soledar (assuming it is indeed 100% lost), Bakhmut is left with two lines of supply, both of which are situated on the left and right flanks of the city (the right flank of which is especially weakened as Soledar had been the front, and now obviously the front has moved up). Bakhmut itself is very easy to defend--an urban industrial city and thus near-impossible to storm against a committed defense. The fate of Bakhmut will be decided on the flanks, and as others have mentioned, the flanks aren't exactly good defensive positions (open fields, rural villages).\n\nUkraine can definitely be in a position where they flood a bunch of units into Bakhmut, lose a bunch of forces (same as Russia, but Russia has more men to throw into a grinder), and then the flank collapses, and then Bakhmut falls. A thought exercise: if Bakhmut falling is inevitable, is it better for Ukraine to waste thousands of lives (taking men away from committed and planned offensives) holding it, or is it better for Ukraine to fall back, thus saving lives and keeping units fresh for a renewed offensive later? \n\nClearly, the former is better in the above thought exercise. The problem is that this is just guesswork. Maybe Ukrainian reinforcements are enough to stem and turn the tide on the flanks. Maybe Ukraine is able to counterattack and retake Soledar. Even the best military minds can't predict how a future battle might turn out. This decision is also more political than it is military. If Ukraine starts abandoning towns out of military logic, then the West may look to that and think Ukraine has given up the fight and thus lower supply deliveries--which can start a death spiral that leads to the collapse of Ukraine.\n\nKnowing all that then, I predict Ukraine will thrust more units into the flanks, but as with other cities that have fallen since the initial invasion, also be prepared to fully evacuate should the city itself be at risk of full encirclement. 'Defend until we can defend no more, then pull back' is very much the definition of attrition warfare, which Russia has the advantage in, but in the absence of better material and supplies to blunt & counter Russian advances (artillery, drones, men, petrol), it is perhaps the only strategy that can be deployed, considering the political context.",

A thought exercise: if Bakhmut falling is inevitable, is it better for Ukraine to waste thousands of lives (taking men away from committed and planned offensives) holding it, or is it better for Ukraine to fall back, thus saving lives and keeping units fresh for a renewed offensive later? </p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the former is better in the above thought exercise. The problem is that this is just guesswork. Maybe Ukrainian reinforcements are enough to stem and turn the tide on the flanks. Maybe Ukraine is able to counterattack and retake Soledar. Even the best military minds can&#39;t predict how a future battle might turn out. This decision is also more political than it is military. If Ukraine starts abandoning towns out of military logic, then the West may look to that and think Ukraine has given up the fight and thus lower supply deliveries--which can start a death spiral that leads to the collapse of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing all that then, I predict Ukraine will thrust more units into the flanks, but as with other cities that have fallen since the initial invasion, also be prepared to fully evacuate should the city itself be at risk of full encirclement. &#39;Defend until we can defend no more, then pull back&#39; is very much the definition of attrition warfare, which Russia has the advantage in, but in the absence of better material and supplies to blunt &amp; counter Russian advances (artillery, drones, men, petrol), it is perhaps the only strategy that can be deployed, considering the political context.</p>\n</div>",

Every Bradley sent to Ukraine is a Bradley not sent to secure NATO's reserves, to protect against China or Iran, or to be deployed to some yet unforeseen conflict (e.g. just last week we saw a riot in Brazil--had that spiraled into a civil war (and who among us can predict whether a riot will become a civil war--if that person exists, where were you in 2010-11!), we'd likely have to send much men and munitions to that country).\n\nThe best solution to this, in my mind, would be to build Ukrainian munitions factories in NATO territory, owned and operated by Ukrainians with NATO funding them. This way, Ukraine isn't reliant on Allied forces who may decide at any time on a whim that Ukrainian defense isn't that high of a priority after all. The only issue is expense and time--while they would be safe from Russian missile strikes, Ukraine would still need to build modern industrial munitions factories, in a financial environment (higher interest rates and inflation) where spinning up new industries is far more expensive.

Even if Iran totally capitulated to a US invasion, armored vehicles would still be needed (and lost, due to attrition and combat losses). But let me focus on the China comment, because I've seen a lot of people talking out about how a war with China will be primarily a naval and air affair. I don't doubt that it will be, at least initially, but I do think we're not considering potential ground fronts, and there is one key front in particular that comes to mind: Korea.\n\nSouth Korea has a sizable US military presence and the Korean military itself would be a robust ally in the region. China, through North Korea, directly borders South Korea. A Chinese unit in Beijing could hop on a train, get to Pyongyang, then march to the border without having to worry about an amphibious operstion. If there is a conflict with regards to Taiwan, and if that conflict is not resolved quickly (total Taiwanese/Allied defeat or total Chinese defeat), then I think spillover into Korea is inevitable. \n\nThink about it this way, at least the way its been presented in various war games: China launches an attack on Taiwan. The attack has some initial success, only to be bogged down on the beaches. The ocean surrounding the Pacific in the meantime becomes a naval graveyard, with dozens of US and Chinese ships mutually destroying one another. Herein settles a status quo: the US can't invade mainland China and force regime change for final victory, nor can China do the same to the US. And so, the war continues, but no side can achieve satisfying enough success to warrant a diplomatic solution, nor does either side's population suffer enough to merit some surrender or climb down action.\n\nIn that context of unsatisfactory total war, both China and the US will seek to weaken the flanks of the other power. If the US is using air bases in Korea against China, that will be all the motivation China needs to launch a ground invasion. But even the mere presence of easier-to-reach Americans may entice them to attack. In this scenario, I'm sure the soldiers on the ground would appreciate as much armor support that we can throw at them. \n\nFinally, we can't predict what tomorrow's war will bring, or when it will come. Maybe China never invades. Maybe Taiwan invades (in a renewed civil war context)! Today's smart investments become tomorrow's boondoggle. But, we can at least be prepared for eventualities, even if they never come to pass.",

IFVs are less survivable and have less in the way of firepower.\n\n> something like a Bradley has the ability to engange tanks with TOW missiles, infantry support with its cannon\n\nThe tank main gun is more effective, and often cheaper, than the Bradley's weapons in both those tasks. You can buy 20 tank shells for the cost of 1 ATGM. Tanks also carry 5-10 times more shells than IFVs carry missiles. They can engage targets that don't justify spending a missile, and they can engage more of them before needing resupply.\n\nWhen it's engaging those targets its efficacy is also better. It's at least as good as the autocannon against soft targets, and much better against concealed or hardened targets. \n\nCompared to ATGMs it also wins in basically all categories. Many ATGMs can't be effectively fired on the move while most tank guns can. Reloading the tank gun is much faster, often 5 or even 10 times. Tank shells also fly through the air several times faster than most ATGMs. This makes them much more likely to arrive at the target before it can vanish under concealment or employ active counter-measures, which lets them fight from longer ranges.

The protection is definitely not perfect, but it is certainly better than what an IFV has.
