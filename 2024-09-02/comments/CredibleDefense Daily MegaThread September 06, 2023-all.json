The increased request reflects the Kishida administration\u2019s intention to boost defense spending and capabilities over the next 5 years. | USNI News | 2023](https://news.usni.org/2023/09/01/japan-releases-53b-defense-budget-focused-on-shipbuilding-fighters)\n\nAmong the programs and acquisitions to be funded are construction of two Aegis-equipped destroyers, joint development with the United States of the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), acquisition of precision-guided missiles, construction of a new class of frigates, acquisition of F-35A and F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters, construction of a fleet oiler and acquisition of ships to improve troop and equipment transportation in response to situations around Japan\u2019s southwest islands.\n\nThe MoD requested $2.6 billion for the construction of two Aegis destroyers with planned deliveries in 2027 and 2028. Along with the Aegis system and SM-6 missiles, the ships also will incorporate an improved version of the Type 12 surface-to-surface missile (SSM) and with space to incorporate future capabilities such as anti-hypersonic glide vehicle interceptor missiles. The two Aegis-equipped ships are expected to be deployed only around Japanese waters in a ballistic missiles defense mission, freeing up two of the current eight Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) Aegis destroyers to serve as carrier strike group escorts once the two Izumo-class carriers complete their conversion to and start operating F-35B Lightning II fighters.\n\nOn August 15,  the United States and Japan announced an agreement to jointly develop the GIP, and the MOD $515 million requested for this project. The budget request also included procurement of overseas standoff weapons such as the Joint Strike Missile (JSM) for its F-35s and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile for its F-15s.\n\nThe first two of a new class of 4,500-ton frigates are to be built under a $1.19 billion request. Japan originally planned to build up to 22 Mogami-class frigates to replace its older destroyers and destroyer escorts, but has now capped the Mogami class to 12 ships with a new class of 12 frigates to be built starting in 2024. The new frigates will have long-range missiles and enhanced antisubmarine warfare and maritime operations capabilities, according to the budget request document. Funding for a new fleet oiler costing $568 million was requested along with the eighth Taigei-class submarine at $650 million. Other JMSDF budget requests include a sixth Awaji-class minesweeper, three improved P-1 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) and 6 SH-60L antisubmarine warfare helicopters.\n\nJMSDF requested $737 million for eight F-35As and $860 million for seven F-35Bs for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force along with funding to upgrade the F-15 fleet and eight F-2 fighters with improved data networking and anti-ship missile capabilities.\n\nJapan plans to establish a new unit to transport troops in its southwest islands with the unit tentatively called the Self-Defense Force Maritime Transport Group with a budget request of $118 million for three landing craft\u2013type boats. Defense of its southwestern islands has become an increased priority for Japan because of China\u2019s claims on the disputed Senkaku islands and increased People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy activities around the international waters there, including regular PLAN carrier deployments. MoD also requested $143 million to develop unmanned amphibious vehicles capable of conducting supply missions to troops on islands.\n\n[Japan\u2019s top court orders Okinawa to allow a divisive government plan to build U.S. military runways | AP News | 2023](https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-okinawa-military-753685ce51dbc9958e1b1d6c43fcbf4d)\n\nJapan\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday dismissed Okinawa\u2019s rejection of a central government plan to build U.S. Marine Corps runways on the island and ordered the prefecture to approve it despite protests by locals who oppose the American troops\u2019 presence.\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling upheld a high court ruling in March that the central government\u2019s plan and its instruction for Okinawa\u2019s approval are valid.

The project competes with the ongoing cooperation between Berlin and Paris.  \n>  \n>Berlin, Brussels, Paris Germany is making a new attempt to develop a successor to the Leopard 2. Led by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and Rheinmetall, a new main battle tank is to be designed with partners from Italy, Spain and Sweden, industry and political sources told Handelsblatt.  \n>  \n>The contracts for the alliance were signed a few days ago, and together the partners now want to apply for funding from the European Defence Fund (EDF). A three-digit million sum is at stake.  \n>  \n>The alliance comes as a surprise, as Germany has already signed a cooperation agreement with France. In 2017, the governments agreed on a main battle tank project called Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) to replace the Leopard 2 and the French Leclerc tank from the middle of the next decade.  \n>  \n>The two countries entrusted the project to KMW and French tank builder Nexter, which have since merged through the joint holding company KNDS. Germany also involved the D\u00fcsseldorf-based arms manufacturer Rheinmetall - but this caused resentment in France. The dispute over the division of labor blocked the armaments project.  \n>  \n>Against this backdrop, the German government is likely to have stepped up planning for the new venture with Spain, Sweden and Italy.

The project competes with the ongoing cooperation between Berlin and Paris.  </p>\n\n<p>Berlin, Brussels, Paris Germany is making a new attempt to develop a successor to the Leopard 2. Led by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and Rheinmetall, a new main battle tank is to be designed with partners from Italy, Spain and Sweden, industry and political sources told Handelsblatt.  </p>\n\n<p>The contracts for the alliance were signed a few days ago, and together the partners now want to apply for funding from the European Defence Fund (EDF). A three-digit million sum is at stake.  </p>\n\n<p>The alliance comes as a surprise, as Germany has already signed a cooperation agreement with France. In 2017, the governments agreed on a main battle tank project called Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) to replace the Leopard 2 and the French Leclerc tank from the middle of the next decade.  </p>\n\n<p>The two countries entrusted the project to KMW and French tank builder Nexter, which have since merged through the joint holding company KNDS. Germany also involved the D\u00fcsseldorf-based arms manufacturer Rheinmetall - but this caused resentment in France. The dispute over the division of labor blocked the armaments project.  </p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the German government is likely to have stepped up planning for the new venture with Spain, Sweden and Italy. With KMW and Rheinmetall, the two heavyweights from Germany are already involved in MGCS.

But years of limited weapons spending left Europe\u2019s defense industry ill equipped to quickly ramp up production after Russia invaded Ukraine last year.\n\n>Pevkur didn\u2019t elaborate on the volumes the industry was expected to reach, but an Estonian policy document sent to member states earlier this year said the bloc had capacity to produce about 300,000 shells per year.\n\n>Doubling that figure would mean producing as many as 600,000 shells by the end of this year, with output continuing to grow.

Pevkur urged countries to sign contracts with defense companies to further ramp up production.\n\n>\u201cWe have to use all the possibilities to achieve these 1 million rounds\u201d for Ukraine, the Estonian minister said by phone.\n\n\nA few points on production (all numbers only relevant to 155mm.) First, that 300k/year production number was cited by the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-is-rushing-arms-to-ukraine-but-running-out-of-ammo-11671707775) at the end of last year, so it's the right baseline figure. Second, RHM said it could produce 600k shells/year by itself, but key to note that a good chunk (~150k) of that production capacity is outside Europe. In its South Africa JV, for example, 49% of the ownership belongs to SOE Denel, and they are obligated to supply the SA military/others. So, the real figure may be closer to 400-450k shells in Europe that are counting towards the E.U. goal. Third, when you include other producers such as Saab, Thales, BAE, CSG, and even smaller ones such as Nammo and Nexter, there is *capacity* to do well over 1mm shells/year. But capacity does *not* equal production, and many of these companies are looking for long-term contracts which *still* haven't been signed. On to *in-house* U.S. production. Doug Bush has now said on three different occasions that the [U.S.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ramps-up-howitzer-shell-production-to-supply-ukraine-replenish-stockpiles-1e6dce54) should reach ~1mm in annual production *by early fiscal 2025* which means in around a year's time. Obviously, there could be contingencies and the actual end-date could be off by a few months, but unless he has repeatedly mistaken what fiscal 2025 means, we're looking at a fairly aggressive timeline. The supposed bottleneck for the ramp up for a while has been sufficient quantities of TNT and not the fabrication or LAP of the actual shells. The U.S. is apparently working on a deal with [Japan](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-seeking-explosives-japan-ukraine-artillery-shells-sources-2023-06-02/) to rectify that situation. Further, U.S. contracted production from allied countries. Per [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f1jphybVBkt3zgWOka65pKYiGD7ipleO/view) sourced by Defense One, a private company has been contracted to source and supply someone with ~265k/year of 155mm production from Pakistan. And per [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WvN9W-dEXy2kCGyTsjmhbFrrhUCn3eMo/view?pli=1), a similar contract for ~420k/year of 155mm production from Bulgaria. Importantly, both of these figures assume dumb/standard annualized 155mm ammunition. Combined, that's capacity for 685k shells per annum if contracts are re-awarded. Now, factoring in replacement levels and other global demand, the allies could still easily supply Ukraine with 2-2.5mm of just 155mm shells/year in the near-term future, if the political will is present. Lastly, on the issue of GMLRS, according to [LMT](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2023/mission-focused-ramping-up-production-ahead-of-evolving-threats.html) itself, they are currently tooled to do 10k/year. Whether they will ramp up to 14k/year in fiscal 24, as [per reports](https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/aaaa/2023/04/27/lockheed-wins-48b-guided-rockets-contract/) is not clear to me. The main bottleneck here was solid rocket motors for the missiles, but apparently NOC is ramping up production (from 5k/year previously) and after LHX bought AJRD, production is supposed to ramp up there as well as more resources become available to the smaller AJRD, along with [$216mm](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3362263/dod-strengthens-supply-chain-for-solid-rocket-motors/) it received in DoD funding to help [automate](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/23/2633609/0/en/Aerojet-Rocketdyne-Streamlines-Process-to-Increase-GMLRS-Rocket-Motor-Production.html) production lines.",

And even when we finally got orders for Europe \\[to protect Eastern Europe\\], almost the entire focus was on anti-armor. Lots of JAV \\[Javelin ATGM\\] and MAAWS \\[M3 Carl Gustaf 84mm recoilless rocket\\] stuff.  \n>  \n\n>\u201cDrone buster\u201d and stinger training, both with mobile trainer teams \\[trainers sent out to different units\\] and us sending people to Sill \\[Fort Sill, Oklahoma, home of artillery and counter drone training school\\].  \n>  \n\n>In Europe, my company happened to be part of a NATO battle group. We did train up and then certifying events.  \n>  \n\n>The Host Nation had almost exclusively COM-block stuff \\[Baltics, Poland, Romania, etc\\]. So for all our events our opfor were T72/BMP1/BRT/etc with them operating as they normally would.  \n>  \n\n>It was\u2026 interesting. In the day, you can get rolled up on by a company of T72 if you don\u2019t have ISR \\[Intel, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, referring to drones and optics\\]. At night though\u2026 it was absurd. They didn\u2019t have thermals, so they drove using IR floods on their vehicles. My javelin gunners could easily get good gates \\[lock on feature for the fire and forget missile seaker\\] on them without them having any idea where we were as they crawled along.  \n>  \n\n>Something I personally noticed, our NATO partners are big on vehicle camouflage, and though it \u201cget it.\u201d I didn\u2019t find it partially effective. You notice something slight amiss, you glass it with your ACOG/TANGO \\[two most common types of rifle optics\\]/whatever and you can see it\u2019s a vehicle at 1K+.  \n>  \n\n>With PAS13 \\[squad level thermal optic usually mounted on rifle or machine gun, or hand carried\\] or CLU \\[Command Launch Unit, the optic and guidance system for the Javelin, that sports an onboard thermal optic\\], you can spot vehicles at ridiculously far distances. And this is WITH vehicles covered in camo netting.  \n>  \n\n>Our NATO partners are very much willing to use civilian communication like SIGNAL \\[secure instant messaging app for cell phones\\] for military purposes. To include certifications and live fires. Adjusting fire for mortars via text message is\u2026 very fast.  \n>  \n\n>Breaching and clearing mined wire obstacles continues to be one of the favorite things for the army.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Part II</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before we went to Europe we were on GRF [Global Response Force mission, highest level of expeditionary readiness] our focus was Syria, though we didn\u2019t act like it [this dates back many years, well before present Ukraine War started]. And even when we finally got orders for Europe [to protect Eastern Europe], almost the entire focus was on anti-armor. Lots of JAV [Javelin ATGM] and MAAWS [M3 Carl Gustaf 84mm recoilless rocket] stuff.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cDrone buster\u201d and stinger training, both with mobile trainer teams [trainers sent out to different units] and us sending people to Sill [Fort Sill, Oklahoma, home of artillery and counter drone training school].  </p>\n\n<p>In Europe, my company happened to be part of a NATO battle group. We did train up and then certifying events.  </p>\n\n<p>The Host Nation had almost exclusively COM-block stuff [Baltics, Poland, Romania, etc]. So for all our events our opfor were T72/BMP1/BRT/etc with them operating as they normally would.  </p>\n\n<p>It was\u2026 interesting. In the day, you can get rolled up on by a company of T72 if you don\u2019t have ISR [Intel, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, referring to drones and optics]. At night though\u2026 it was absurd. They didn\u2019t have thermals, so they drove using IR floods on their vehicles. My javelin gunners could easily get good gates [lock on feature for the fire and forget missile seaker] on them without them having any idea where we were as they crawled along.  </p>\n\n<p>Something I personally noticed, our NATO partners are big on vehicle camouflage, and though it \u201cget it.\u201d I didn\u2019t find it partially effective. You notice something slight amiss, you glass it with your ACOG/TANGO [two most common types of rifle optics]/whatever and you can see it\u2019s a vehicle at 1K+.  </p>\n\n<p>With PAS13 [squad level thermal optic usually mounted on rifle or machine gun, or hand carried] or CLU [Command Launch Unit, the optic and guidance system for the Javelin, that sports an onboard thermal optic], you can spot vehicles at ridiculously far distances. And this is WITH vehicles covered in camo netting.  </p>\n\n<p>Our NATO partners are very much willing to use civilian communication like SIGNAL [secure instant messaging app for cell phones] for military purposes. To include certifications and live fires. Adjusting fire for mortars via text message is\u2026 very fast.  </p>\n\n<p>Breaching and clearing mined wire obstacles continues to be one of the favorite things for the army. Virtually every live fire I\u2019ve ever done had included them [take note, he&#39;s been in roughly a decade]. Many with the infantry unit doing the explosive breach [versus sapper combat engineers, sometimes tasked to do it themselves].  </p>\n\n<p>In Estonia, our live fires spanned a several mile maneuver box [area where training is conducted], Estonian 120mm mortars on call for our rifle platoons and an explosive breach followed by assaulting a trench.

We&#39;re still involved with Syria. Iraq, Africa, and we are ignoring them while still deploying troops to them...</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "The overall brutal efficiency of the US Armed Forces is out of the question, just because of the sheer number of the combat capable brigades\\regiments, effective doctrines based on quick-paced staff work with a streamlined planning (MDMP is really something so streamlined that you can even teach a monkey to do it), fully equipped with large stocks (by NATO standards), large immediate and potential reserves, and of course the industry\\technology. I'd consider US Armed forces to be the only truly combat capable NATO force apart from Poland, maybe Greece&Turkey, maybe France (don't know much about France). Germany & Britain has a core of some good officers and a couple of skeleton units, surviving despite neglect, but for what I saw outdated doctrines and no readiness. Italy, Spain, Portugal etc are in really bad shape it seems. \n\nAnd that's kind of the issue. \"NATO doctrine\" is supposed to revolve around some basic joint combat doctrines and standards, but on practice each member state is doing their own stuff within a loose framework. For what I saw on some NATO exercises and discussing with various officers\\NCOs from different countries, let's say things are often not going smooth. \n\nSo if you ask a random enlisted what's NATO doctrine, you'd receive a random answer. And this translates in training. When you hear that UAF forces are being NATO trained, what it means that they are trained by various member states, often without any consolidated structure or coordination, by randomly assigned trainers (never the best ones), that often have a zero clue (or a negative-value clue tbh), especially with regards to combined arms and infantry doctrines. What I hear from people, and what I see in some detailed media reports - is often not just ineffective, but outright dangerous and will get you (and your entire platoon\\company) killed in your first engagement. If that's the \"NATO doctrine\" that some member states pursue, I don't know what would happen if their limited forces would be put to a real test, especially considering that these states often have zero capacity to reconstitute \\ mobilize when they inevitably run out of their active units.\n\nFinally, I know American doctrines\\ttp very well, and yeah, many of the standard scenarios they envision will not work as expected. Kill chain is rapidly shortened. Artillery is very (very) accurate. Concentrating is hard. A room for mistake is ever tinier. If you misjudge and hastily attack where you shouldn't, you will get wiped out faster than you can send a contact report. It is very hard to judge where you can attack, and that is if you are competent.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The overall brutal efficiency of the US Armed Forces is out of the question, just because of the sheer number of the combat capable brigades\\regiments, effective doctrines based on quick-paced staff work with a streamlined planning (MDMP is really something so streamlined that you can even teach a monkey to do it), fully equipped with large stocks (by NATO standards), large immediate and potential reserves, and of course the industry\\technology. I&#39;d consider US Armed forces to be the only truly combat capable NATO force apart from Poland, maybe Greece&amp;Turkey, maybe France (don&#39;t know much about France). Germany &amp; Britain has a core of some good officers and a couple of skeleton units, surviving despite neglect, but for what I saw outdated doctrines and no readiness. Italy, Spain, Portugal etc are in really bad shape it seems. </p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s kind of the issue. &quot;NATO doctrine&quot; is supposed to revolve around some basic joint combat doctrines and standards, but on practice each member state is doing their own stuff within a loose framework. For what I saw on some NATO exercises and discussing with various officers\\NCOs from different countries, let&#39;s say things are often not going smooth. </p>\n\n<p>So if you ask a random enlisted what&#39;s NATO doctrine, you&#39;d receive a random answer. And this translates in training. When you hear that UAF forces are being NATO trained, what it means that they are trained by various member states, often without any consolidated structure or coordination, by randomly assigned trainers (never the best ones), that often have a zero clue (or a negative-value clue tbh), especially with regards to combined arms and infantry doctrines. What I hear from people, and what I see in some detailed media reports - is often not just ineffective, but outright dangerous and will get you (and your entire platoon\\company) killed in your first engagement. If that&#39;s the &quot;NATO doctrine&quot; that some member states pursue, I don&#39;t know what would happen if their limited forces would be put to a real test, especially considering that these states often have zero capacity to reconstitute \\ mobilize when they inevitably run out of their active units.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I know American doctrines\\ttp very well, and yeah, many of the standard scenarios they envision will not work as expected. Kill chain is rapidly shortened. Artillery is very (very) accurate. Concentrating is hard. A room for mistake is ever tinier. If you misjudge and hastily attack where you shouldn&#39;t, you will get wiped out faster than you can send a contact report. It is very hard to judge where you can attack, and that is if you are competent. Small units might not have enough medicine or food, but they most likely will have enough weapons to burn your entire company if you stumble into them. New stuff like loitering drones (especially FPVs) are still not taken seriously enough. And lots of other stuff not for public disclosure.</p>\n</div>",

So why weren't they jamming them? \n\nFor the same reason the latest RUSI report says Ukrainian commanders don't like to use smoke for obscuring, because then they can't see either. The Ukrainians don't want to jam Russian comms or drones because then they jam their own. And vice versa. \n\nAnd that doesn't even cover SHORAD use. Ukrainians mostly have theirs guarding cities, and I've not really seen much Russian gun-based SHORAD in the whole war. Where are the Shilka and Tunguska?\n\nIn terms of EW, the US definitely has some capabilities, I'm not sure what but I do know that a lot of the UAF EW systems are from us, thanks to OSINT sources. \n\nWhatever we have, we also use secure comms, freq hopping, and we have them down to the squad level. And we also have the training to know how to fill them; something tells me the barely trained Ukrainians don't have well trained individuals at the small unit level present 24/7 to load comsec fills and mess with freq hopping in the secure radios they might possess, more likely they probably run their secure comms In the Clear too so they can communicate with commercial ICOMs too). \n\nAnd I'm guessing the drones we use are way more secure than the Chinese crap that most of the Ukrainians and a far amount of the Russians are using.

The job of his agency, which is less well known than the cia, is to take the military measure of America\u2019s foes. That often requires quantitative judgments: the range of an Iranian missile or the size of China\u2019s fleet. An annual dia report, \u201cSoviet Military Power\u201d, was read avidly during the cold war. But intangibles are just as important.

Instead, \u201cthey basically folded pretty quickly.\u201d That experience, along with the evaporation of the Iraqi army in the face of the Islamic State group, led dia to \u201cover-correct\u201d when judging how Ukraine would fare when Russia invaded last year. \u201cWe had a similar thought that they were just overwhelmed on paper.\u201d It has proved a teachable moment. Mr Maul brandishes a 40-page \u201ctradecraft note\u201d, published this January, which re-examines how the agency measures a country\u2019s will to fight.  \n>  \n>The paper emphasises how national factors\u2014for instance, Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s insistence on staying in Kyiv, compared with Ashraf Ghani\u2019s decision to flee Kabul\u2014can affect the battlefield. It points to the importance of leadership on the front lines, an army\u2019s esprit de corps, the strength of its command and control, and whether it enjoys sustained logistical and medical support. Such things were neglected because of the presumption that Ukraine\u2019s leadership would be outmatched and defeated quickly. It is to guard against that sort of error that dia analysts now fill out a detailed worksheet to help them think through these factors and how they can interact in unexpected ways.  \n>  \n>This methodology is crucial when it comes to assessing the coming weeks in Ukraine. Mr Maul says that the dia will be watching for signs that Russia can keep up the flow of artillery ammunition to the front lines and maintain leadership at the local level. He concedes that American and Ukrainian officials failed to appreciate the depth of Russia\u2019s defences and how difficult it would be for Ukraine to \u201csmash through\u201d them with armour. Ukrainian generals have told the Guardian newspaper that 80% of Russia\u2019s effort went into building its first and second lines. But Mr Maul cautions that the bulk of Russia\u2019s reinforcements remain at the third.  \n>  \n>In recent weeks American officials have privately sniped at Ukrainian commanders over their military strategy\u2014in particular the decision to deploy experienced units in the east around Bakhmut rather than on the key axis in the south. Mr Maul is more tactful. \u201cIt\u2019s open to debate whether the Ukrainians have deployed the sort of tactics that you would hope would have made more aggressive gains in a shorter time,\u201d he offers. More important are two critical variables: Ukraine\u2019s stockpile of ammunition, vital for sustaining the artillery barrages that enable progress, and the weather, which becomes wetter in the autumn.  \n>  \n>One Biden administration official says that Ukraine has around six to seven weeks of combat left before its offensive culminates. There are private disagreements over how much progress can be made in that time. Some reckon that Ukraine\u2019s army, having thrown in most of its reserves prior to breaking the second line, and taking heavy casualties attempting to breach it, is unlikely to get far. \u201cIf you look at the battlefield in five years\u2019 time, it could look broadly similar,\u201d says a senior American intelligence official, emphasising that the quality of both Russian and Ukrainian forces is declining over time.  \n>  \n>Mr Maul is somewhat less gloomy. He notes that Sergei Surovokin, the Russian general who built the defensive lines, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner Group mercenaries achieved Russia\u2019s most tangible gains of the past year, are both off the battlefield\u2014the former sacked and the latter dead in a plane crash. Mr Maul, choosing his words with care, says that Ukraine\u2019s recent successes are \u201csignificant\u201d and give its forces a \u201crealistic possibility\u201d\u2014intel-speak for 40-50% probability\u2014of breaking the remaining Russian lines by the end of the year. But he warns that limited ammunition and worsening weather will make this \u201cvery difficult\u201d.  \n>  \n>Attention is already turning to the next fighting season. Even without a breakthrough this year, the dia is moderately confident that if Ukraine can widen the salient around Robotyne, hold its positions and keep ammo flowing in, it will be well placed for a fresh push in 2024",

He concedes that American and Ukrainian officials failed to appreciate the depth of Russia\u2019s defences and how difficult it would be for Ukraine to \u201csmash through\u201d them with armour. Ukrainian generals have told the Guardian newspaper that 80% of Russia\u2019s effort went into building its first and second lines. But Mr Maul cautions that the bulk of Russia\u2019s reinforcements remain at the third.  </p>\n\n<p>In recent weeks American officials have privately sniped at Ukrainian commanders over their military strategy\u2014in particular the decision to deploy experienced units in the east around Bakhmut rather than on the key axis in the south. Mr Maul is more tactful. \u201cIt\u2019s open to debate whether the Ukrainians have deployed the sort of tactics that you would hope would have made more aggressive gains in a shorter time,\u201d he offers. More important are two critical variables: Ukraine\u2019s stockpile of ammunition, vital for sustaining the artillery barrages that enable progress, and the weather, which becomes wetter in the autumn.  </p>\n\n<p>One Biden administration official says that Ukraine has around six to seven weeks of combat left before its offensive culminates. There are private disagreements over how much progress can be made in that time. Some reckon that Ukraine\u2019s army, having thrown in most of its reserves prior to breaking the second line, and taking heavy casualties attempting to breach it, is unlikely to get far. \u201cIf you look at the battlefield in five years\u2019 time, it could look broadly similar,\u201d says a senior American intelligence official, emphasising that the quality of both Russian and Ukrainian forces is declining over time.  </p>\n\n<p>Mr Maul is somewhat less gloomy. He notes that Sergei Surovokin, the Russian general who built the defensive lines, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner Group mercenaries achieved Russia\u2019s most tangible gains of the past year, are both off the battlefield\u2014the former sacked and the latter dead in a plane crash. Mr Maul, choosing his words with care, says that Ukraine\u2019s recent successes are \u201csignificant\u201d and give its forces a \u201crealistic possibility\u201d\u2014intel-speak for 40-50% probability\u2014of breaking the remaining Russian lines by the end of the year. But he warns that limited ammunition and worsening weather will make this \u201cvery difficult\u201d.  </p>\n\n<p>Attention is already turning to the next fighting season. Even without a breakthrough this year, the dia is moderately confident that if Ukraine can widen the salient around Robotyne, hold its positions and keep ammo flowing in, it will be well placed for a fresh push in 2024</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

            "body": "It's not a monolithic slab of DU sandwiched between two steel plates. Modern armor is _structured_ in a way to disrupt/break-up the incoming penetrator and then erode it into nothing. \n\nWe 'know' the original Chobham armor developed in the 1960s was non-explosive reactive armor composed of polymers sandwiches between steel plates, all encased between the inner and outer steel layers. Reactive armor, explosive or not, works by displacing the steel plates that encase it. The lateral forces of the moving plates disrupt the incoming penetrator, so that it is yawed or broken-up and hence impacts over a larger area of the backing plate.\n\nChobham was then evolved to include ceramic plates.

        "body": "It will be interesting to see how things play out how this war ends with Russia post war.\n\nChurchill once said, \u201cKremlin political intrigues are comparable to a bulldog fight under a rug. An outsider only hears the growling, and when he sees the bones fly out from beneath it is obvious who won.\u201d\n\nGoing by history, Stalin was a complete unknown nonentity outside the Bolshevik party. A skulking shadow, running bank heists or a sinister agent provocateur organizing murders, arson and kidnappings. \n\nTo the West at the time, Bukharin, Zinoviev or Trotsky would have been immeasurably more visible. And picked as the ones in the lead. \n\nIt was Bukharin who drafted the Soviet Constitution. If you thought you understood politics, the writer of the Constitution would be in the running? After all, Thomas Jefferson became President. \n\nIn the end Bukharin got a bullet in the neck, tearfully begging \u201cSoso\u201d for forgiveness by letter and confessing to being a traitor in kangaroo trial. In a normal state the leader of the Red Army (Trotsky) could have seized power. Yet he was exiled by the Party and got a pick axe in the temple in Mexico. Nothing is as it seems in Russia.\n\nOnce Putin dies it will be frightening to see how it plays out. Unlike a Czardom there\u2019s no heir apparent. Unlike the Communists there\u2019s no politburo. In modern Russia no one man besides Stalin ever wielded so much direct power. What makes it worse in a sense is its constitutionally enshrined. The President rules by decree.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It will be interesting to see how things play out how this war ends with Russia post war.</p>\n\n<p>Churchill once said, \u201cKremlin political intrigues are comparable to a bulldog fight under a rug. An outsider only hears the growling, and when he sees the bones fly out from beneath it is obvious who won.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Going by history, Stalin was a complete unknown nonentity outside the Bolshevik party. A skulking shadow, running bank heists or a sinister agent provocateur organizing murders, arson and kidnappings. </p>\n\n<p>To the West at the time, Bukharin, Zinoviev or Trotsky would have been immeasurably more visible. And picked as the ones in the lead. </p>\n\n<p>It was Bukharin who drafted the Soviet Constitution. If you thought you understood politics, the writer of the Constitution would be in the running? After all, Thomas Jefferson became President. </p>\n\n<p>In the end Bukharin got a bullet in the neck, tearfully begging \u201cSoso\u201d for forgiveness by letter and confessing to being a traitor in kangaroo trial. In a normal state the leader of the Red Army (Trotsky) could have seized power. Yet he was exiled by the Party and got a pick axe in the temple in Mexico. Nothing is as it seems in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Once Putin dies it will be frightening to see how it plays out. Unlike a Czardom there\u2019s no heir apparent. Unlike the Communists there\u2019s no politburo. In modern Russia no one man besides Stalin ever wielded so much direct power. What makes it worse in a sense is its constitutionally enshrined. The President rules by decree.

You can have a rocket motor, a type of jet/ramjet, an internal combustion engine or these days a small electric motor to do the pushing. \n\nKind of basic but really worth setting it out in the beginning. \n\nFor our purposes on the battle field you will have three sources of power, a low explosive mixed with oxidiser will provide a solid rocket motor, a variant of kerosene mixed with air will give you jets and ICUs and batteries will give you electricity. \n\nNow there is a concept called energy density, either unit volume or unit mass\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy\\_density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density)\n\nYou take either a unit of volume or a unit of mass and work out how many watt hours the energy source will give you. For reference a good grade of kerosene will give you about 12000 Wh/kg. This is generally about the best mix of energy density for mass and volume you get with a cheap substance that is liquid at room temperature and a range of usable temperatures, so we use this for rockets like Falcon 9 (RP-1 is highly refined kerosene), aircraft jet engines (the various grades of jet fuel like Jet A, JP 4) and for piston engines like avgas. Methane has a higher energy density per kg but worse by volume (this is part of the reason Starship and New Glenn are using it, plus things like specific impulse but that is way beyond what we are looking at).\n\nSolid fuels will be in a similar ball park if not as high. I cant remember but the information is out there in rocketnerd circles. \n\nThing is batteries come in at about 200 Wh/kg. This is why the batteries on a Tesla weigh so much for so little range. So it takes a lot of mass to get the same energy as a kerosene fuelled engine. That mass very rapidly takes away payload capacity, range and total power output. This is why Teslas might have 500kg of battery  and have the range of a few 10s of kgs of petrol. \n\nWhich brings us to the technology that seems to have every wannabe war futurologist buzzing with plans to kill super carriers with drone swarms or replace GBAD systems with FPV drones or whatever. \n\nDrones are useful but they rely on batteries that mean they have very small cargo capacities, very short range and the kind of power output that means they struggle to hit speeds much faster than a bicycle going downhill (40mph). \n\nThey have a very very narrow set of parameters they can fly in. \n\nI have walked through the physics so its easier for people to remember than opening up with an argument and having people getting hot and bothered. If you want to start building drones using jet engines and petrol engines you kind of leap up in size, thermal output and noise. You now are in a different class of weapon we have been using for many decades. And the more weight and size rises the more costs rise and you start hitting size and costs that make it comfortably cost effective for a shoulder fired SAM. \n\nWhy are drones, especially weaponised ones like the Zala Lancet such a big issue this war? Its not like stealth or jet engines that totally changed the basics of how aerial wars were fought. Instead for the past few decades everything has been getting faster, lower, stealthier, with bigger badder electronics suits. So GBAD has been optomised for $50 million aircraft at 100m and stealthy. We gave up our older systems optimised for hitting lots of slow targets. \n\nDrones represent a gap in defence capabilities, not because they have some unkillable performance characteristic. But because they fill into gaps in air defences. Gaps that will be very cheap to fill. Things like APS designed to stop near Mach 1 anti tank rounds, will eat up and spit out Zala Lancets. Bringing back old tracked SPAAGs will knock many drones out the skies. Its going to be something like a 50 cal slaved to a cheap radar or IR system produced in numbers that will end the drones current form. \n\nThey are at their physical limits without wild new technology. They are not going to be sinking carriers or wiping out armoured brigades. Try to bear the physical limit of their battery power to weight ratios when people get all super excited about them. When you put a 100kg warhead in a jet powered drone with a 500km range? Yay you just reinvented the cruise missile.",

This counteroffensive is already over 90 days and only has small villages to show for it. I think Ukraine took this village more a week ago but instead of rapidly develop on this breach by moving south to strategic target of reaching Tokmak and Melitipol, Ukraine is now attacking to the east towards Verbove. This is the problem with counteroffensive - Ukraine is not rapidly advancing towards strategic objective of reaching Azov coast instead it is bogged down in grindy, attritional battle largely due to Russia's very impressive defensive fortifications. I think Ukraine should call off this offensive, start training their troops to be better at coordinating and at combined arms operations and stockpiling ammo for next year. The goal for next year's offensive should be rapid advances by either breaching Russian defensive fortifications or bypassing them altogether to reach the Azov coast as quickly as possible.

A obvious solution would be to buy older equipment from allied states that is being phased out. That would allow for hundreds of Tanks IFVs and Artillery systems, as well as dozens of Airplanes and Helicopters to be acquired. As we see in Ukraine, older equipment is not as good as newer one obviously, but the difference in performance is overstated. I.e. 10 Bradleys are better than 2-3 Puma IFVs.(Roughly same price) Now the biggest problem with this approach is maintenance. As these systems get older it becomes exponentially harder and more expensive to maintain them. So I\u2019m looking for creative solutions for this problem. I was thinking of metal 3D printing the spare parts. What are some other solutions to this problem? What have other countries tried and succeeded/failed? Thanks",
