      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

The number of if's used in those articles is ridiculous. \n\nSecondly if North Korea had used a tritium boosted weapon in its September 2017 test then we would have easily detected even very low levels of tritum. \n\nConsidering how close the North Hanmgyong Mountain range was to the coast (139km to international waters) aircraft could have easily picked up samples. \n\nIn 2016 the IRT reactor was not online (wasn't even close to operating) whilst satalite observations shown that in 2020 the reactors were still off-line. \n\nThe 5 MW Yongbyon reactor could have, at best produced 7 grams of Tritum over a decade, and or plutonium (not both). Which considering the half life of the tritum would mean that North Korea has exhausted its tritum supply, and or their plutonium (which makes sense hence their push to enrich uranium). \n\nIn any case these arguments will be settled shortly.

It is 30% to 36% slower and requires 200 crew instead of 40-50.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned by their designation they are completely different class of ships.  Far as I recall they wanted the LCS for a couple of reasons, one was that in war games they found it harder to protect fewer more powerful ships than with more less powerful ones.  They also had issues being \u201ceverywhere at once\u201d and felt having tons of smaller ships would allow them to be active in more regions and be able to sustain losses longer in war.</p>\n\n<p>LCS also, I thought anyways, was meant to be near the coast lines supporting marine detachments or being in places where it is narrow or shallow.</p>\n\n<p>I get not giving into the sunk cost fallacy, but the us navy really needs to makeup it\u2019s mind what kind of force it wants instead of apparently switching midstream.</p>\n</div>",

However, for context, that sum of money would have been 75% of the FY2022 approved foreign aid budget of $44b. And I can't think of a time that much money went directly to a single nation without there being American boots on the ground. So there was no way of knowing for certain if Congress would have balked at the price. Even so, the first Ukraine supplemental bill approved on March 15th - barely 3 weeks into the war - was $13.6b, and that was only for six months. \n\nThe other point is that I feel like that is a lot of hindsight because the situation was changing fast, but also tens of billions of dollars were appropriated quite quickly. At the US predicted Kyiv would fall to a Russian invasion and they'd be supplying an insurgency. An insurgency doesn't use AFVs, they're much smaller, mobile, and less expensive to support. And to defend the US's assessment, it was a near thing. It really came down to a bit of luck combined with the sheer tenacity of everyday Ukrainians to grab a gun and hop into the fight. That's not something easy to predict. \n\nHowever, that made most of Ukraine's active forces at the time light infantry, and sometimes hastily trained light infantry. Equipping them with guns, ammo, and body armor was a priority over tanks that would take forever to get there and train on. Even javelins and stingers were priority because they were easy to learn and use for those troops. \n\nWhen the US passed it's first Ukraine supplemental aid bill on March 15th,  [this](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/a41c68e2-4437-41cd-bdf6-8b5d86dacce4.jpg) is what the war looked like. The thunder run was over, but Ukraine still hadn't pushed back Russia from near Kyiv or the northeast. It wasn't certain that they could push them out, either. But $13.6b would go a long way to doing that if spent on things that could be used immediately. \n\nIf it would have been $30b would it have realistically made a difference? Probably, but I doubt by much. The big issue was finding gear to donate at the time due to it being in poor condition and needing it for the country's own defense. Plus, $30b isn't enough to start spooling up industries that have atrophied while dealing with supply chain issues still from the pandemic. Maybe there was some Soviet equipment out there that could have gotten there sooner. \n\nAlso, the whole \"if we had more money at the beginning\" falls a bit flat because by May 15th, two months later, the US passed $40.1b dollars in more aid. So at that point 2.5 months into the war, $53.7b were appropriated. That's literally $5b a week appropriated if it was split evenly. Maybe if the US has passed $100b in 2.5 months they might have been able to send everything they did and start contracts on spinning up production, but that's equal to the highest amount appropriated a year for the war in Afghanistan. I don't know what lawmaker in an election year would have suggested that, especially since they had to know the war wouldn't end in a year.",

Hell, it&#39;s already gone way better than anybody would have expected pre invasion even if we assume Russia ultimately wins a pyrrhic victory from here. Don&#39;t forget that back then a lot of very credible analysts were pushing for spending the few week window we had to arm an insurgency to make it a very costly decision for Putin. That seems a bit silly over a year later with it still being a grueling war with more Russian losses than an insurgency could have ever hoped to cause, but it&#39;s what was thought.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t looked this deeply into the numbers to see if this is actually the case here, but there&#39;s also a pretty big aid calculus difference between giving Ukraine munitions already made and designed to fight the Russians to fight the Russians and making more munitions to do the same. Especially because this has already made Russia a much smaller threat, so replacing those munitions won&#39;t necessarily make sense.</p>\n</div>",
