      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

By drone I mean small electric Class I UAV and not larger aircraft with internal combustion engines like the Shadow (similar to the distinction in [Perun's video on the topic][2]).\n\nThey compete with civilian off the shelf drones like the DJI Air 2S that cost $850 now (it looks to be a sale price so with lower profit margin). Smaller companies can't achieve the same economy of scale as DJI. However there are hobby drone builders that operate on a similar budget and I would also expect a million dollar contract can close at least some of the gap and allow them to make an efficient production line.\n\nThe closest drones to the Mavic drones in the US Army are the Wasp, Puma and Raven. They are fielded by many other NATO countries too. According to Wikipedia, Puma has 16 NATO operators and Raven has 17 (I may be off in my counting by 1 or 2) out of 31 (now) or 32 countries (with Sweden). The Puma has 15 km range and 2 hours flight time, the Raven has 10 km range and 60-90 minutes flight time, the Air 2S has 12 km range and 31 minutes flight time. From what I could find, Puma costs between $83,000 and $240,000, the Raven is \u2248 $35,000, the Wasp is \u2248 $49,000.\n\nI see the value of medium altitude Class II UAV in the higher price range but given how many drones are needed for fielding them at squad level and how it would be cheaper to replace a commercial drone every 2 weeks than to buy and use a military-spec one for a year, I just don't see the point of buying small expensive drones (mid-5-figure dollars price). In addition, when the war is over there would be many Ukrainian drones manufacturers looking for new customers.\n\nDo you expect the currently fielded small military drones to get gradually phased out with cheaper drones that are more similar in cost with commercial civilian drones?\n\n[1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/13zaoh0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_03_2023/jmr2sec/\n[2]: https://youtu.be/AlpZf1hpQYM?t=426",

The captions below are reductive of the actual arguments so I recommend listening to the full context if there is something you particularly disagree with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Vpg_ei8tw\n\n*Sergej Sumlenny is a political expert and a founder of the Berlin-based think tank European Resilience Initiative Center. In his interview with Jonathan Fink, a founder of the podcast Silicon Curtain, Sergej talks about German perception of Russia, how Russia sought to undermine Ukraine's statehood, and why the German society was not ready to address its guilt towards Central and Eastern European countries.*\n\n[2:41] I never had connections to Ukraine before I moved to Kyiv in 2015. I was born in the Soviet Union, in the territory of contemporary Russia [...] and 20 years ago I moved to Germany, renounced my Russian citizenship, and now I'm a part of the German political nation. When I came to Ukraine, I felt obliged to Ukraine -- as a former Russian and as a German -- because both of my nations [...] have tried to erase Ukrainian nationhood.\n\n[9:09] In the Soviet Union, the Holocaust was a banned topic. [...] If you look at the monuments where Jews have been killed by the Germans, there was no mention of Jews: they were all called \"peaceful Soviet citizens\". [...] It was extremely important to forbid this history, not just because of anti-semitism but also because it would've raised a lot of questions about the similarities of the two regimes.\n\n[12:54] For the German government that was very comfortable, because you could deal with Moscow without ever thinking about the rights of the nations between the two regimes. [...] That continued up 'til recently: in early Feb/2022, two weeks before the full-scale invasion, the German president Steinmeier [...] gave an interview about the necessity of Nord Stream 2 [...] because this is the last remaining bridge between Germany and Russia, and this is the way we repay our debt for WW2.\n\n[14:33] He ignored the German responsibility towards Ukraine or Poland. Those two countries said: don't build Nord Stream 2, because the moment the pipeline is finished the Russians will invade Ukraine. And that's what happened.\n\n[19:37] Even before February of last year there was clear genocidal rhetoric coming out of Russian propaganda. [...] There was a failure to react to that, and that's not just Germany -- all of Europe, America, we all failed to react.\n\n[27:00] If we want to deconstruct the mythology of the Soviet-soldier-who-is-a-Russian-soldier -- and if you read the German media, they mostly use the term \"Russian soldier\" -- then who was the most effective Soviet fighter pilot? It was Kozhedub, who was from Ukraine. [...] Who opened the gates of Auschwitz? [...] A Ukrainian Jew from Odessa. [...] After WW2, the Russians ran a PR campaign of appropriation of history.\n\n[30:38] The victory of WW2 became a Russian victory. The inventions of the Soviet era all became Russian inventions. Even if it was Ukrainians, or Georgians, or Lithuanians, etc. All the bad things that happened, of course, were the guilt of all Republics. For example, the Russians blamed Ukrainians for being Nazi collaborators.\n\n[37:50] It is the Soviet narrative to discredit Ukrainians and to proclaim any attempt at their own statehood as a Nazi or neo-Nazi approach.\n\n[42:25] Germany has lost two world wars. After the second time, Germany was divided and occupied -- and the eastern half was occupied by not the most friendly and progressive people. And still Germany is today one of the most successful and important countries in the world. So, from the German perspective, being occupied is not a big deal.\n\n[45:53] From the German perspective, when you are in a war: just capitulate! There is no such thing as patriotism, heroism, or military duty.\n\n[52:07] Ukrainians strike me as being extraordinarily detached from the terrible reality. [...] They are the opposite of hysterical emotional people. I've come to realize they're extraordinarily rational and capable people, so listening to them is actually what we have to do.\n\n[55:13] We know that the Russians planned full-scale genocide and what they did in Bucha was just an appetizer. One month before the invasion, the Russians introduced a legal functional standard for mass graves: 3 soldiers and 1 bulldozer have to produce, within 2 days, a mass grave for 1600 bodies. [...] The Russians came with whole columns of riot police, barbed wire, they had death lists and everything. Only the British NLAWs, the American Javelins, and the Polish Perun anti-air missiles saved Kyiv from that fate.\n\n[56:52] One of my [Ukrainian] colleagues told me: \"Sergej, we could never imagine this would happen! We were told we were brother nations.\" And I told him: \"That's the problem. You are Ukrainian.\" [...] I'm Russian-born, I was never told about that. I was told that Ukrainians either don't exist, or are bad Russians.\n\n[1:01:55] I think we need a tribunal. These people need to know that they are being hunted... and after Vladimir Putin was announced as a wanted criminal by the ICC, he never left his country. He can say \"I don't care, I'm not afraid, ICC means nothing,\" but he never left the country.

On a 2km long section it would be dozens of boats\n\nYou misread what I wrote I said \"NOT 200 boats, you'd have something like 5-10-20 boats\".\n\nThat seems to accord well with your \"a dozen boats\".\n\nThe point is.... the force they have to deal with is a defined section of the bridge, in a working state, with only the hull of the bridge submerged (likely with a small submerged \"hull\" cross-section pointing upstream). For each section held by a boat, a few m2 streamlined in the direction of the flow of the river.\n\nOnce you SINK A SECTION it has to deal with the river force pushing on that submerged section, with a cross section the water is pushing against potentially as large as a 4m wide road section submerged lengthways against the current.\n\nThe boats can push an intact bridge and keep it in place against the river flow if its dealing with a dozen m2 of streamlined hull pointed upriver.\n\nYou can't sink a section of it and expect the boats to be able to hold an 80m2 (say) section sunk across the rivers flow. It'll pull off downstream, taking other (floating) sections of the bridge with it.\n\n>False, see above, this is getting tiresome. You lose perhaps 2-3 sections. If that.\n\nWell, if we go with your \"dozen boats\" and our 200 sections...... each boat is supporting 15 sections. If that boat is overcome by the force of having one of those sunk, 15 are going to go off downriver at a mimnimum.....even if it doesn't pull another \"boats worth\" of sections with it.\n\nThis isn't a static structure fixed to anything solid. Its a dynamic structure relying on pushing against the rivers flow. Once one bit goes and starts to pull on the other sections of the bridge.... those sections are going to have to deal with the extra load of the damaged/sunk section (at a minimum) and likely a much greater load being placed on their (floating) section as well.... as the damaged section increasingly pulls them so they are more and more side-on across the current rather than pointing their hulls up it. Once stuff starts to get side on, the force involved increases exponentially as more and more cross section gets exposed to the rivers flow.....which pulls it more out of the streamlined line....which increases the pressure etc etc.\n\n>Again, false, there are enough boats that losing any single one of them is inconsequential. Furthermore wide river means slow current.\n\nBut its not just \"a boat\" its likely \"a boat lost at the point where a section has already been sunk increasing its cross section against the flow from \"A dozen m2 of streamlined hull\" to \"one 80m2 section sunk and pulling on the rest\" as well as \"multiple dozens of m2 of non streamlined hull\" as the pontoon boats get pulled sideways to the flow by the sunk section.\n\nAttempt to pottato quality draw it out.... Top Intact bridge, pontoons pointing upstream..... Middle, one pontoon span is sunk whilst attached at one end to the pontoons..... Bottom, this pulls the other pontoons increasingly side on to the river.\n\nRed area is the area our boat is got to hold steady against the rivers flow pushing against it (whcih gets worse and worse as the bridge pontoons get increasingly dragged side on to the flow)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/GT3exRT\n\nThis is whats going to start snapping off great big chunks of it if a sunk section overwhelms the ability of a single \"pusher boat\" to keep its 100m long or so section straight.\n\n>You can make makeshift sections. It's not rocket science, just a floating device. If Ukraine has prioritized this they could have literally thousands. They're building FPV drones in the thousands per month.\n\n4,000 m2 of welded steel (for the road alone) + 200? 10m long Pontoons + 20 Tugs pushing the whole thing is not a bunch of FPV drones.\n\nIts a lot of steel that has to be built and floated on the river (either as its built or trucked in and floated at a later date). \n\nYou can build FPV drones in a suburban huse and no-one is any the wiser..... here you're talking about the equivalent of building/floating a large cruiser on a river *which the russians still have under direct observation* without anyone noticing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you could build it in Odessa/Mykolaiv. It'd still be visibile from space, but maybe you could get away with it...... but then you've got to float your 200 10m sections across the balck sea and up the dnipro to where you want your bridge and it'd be pretty wide open to attack that whole time by anti-ship missiles and whatever else the Ru Navy can throw at it (torpedo's?)\n\n>False, False and False. Not few, several. Pretty significant war heads. \n\nWarheads..... about the size of Geran drone warheads (which you described as puny). And about 1/20th the size of Kalibre/Anti-Ship Missile/Orthodox JDAM Warheads.\n\n>False and False, in our scenario Ukraine holds both sides of the river. Replace anchoring to the bridge with riverine boats and you literally have an example of how it will work contrary to your ignorant and unfounded opinion. You're literally arguing against proven facts.\n\nOK, but riverine boats are NOT giant concrete pillars sunk into the river-floor of the Dnipro. The pillars couldn't be overcome, as described above, by a sunk section getting sideways on the river, and pulling all the other pontoon boats, sideways on to the river. The barges were already side on, and the dozens of concrete pillars sunk into the river bed  could support that force.\n\nYou've got a situation (with riverine boats pushing against the river with props) that can't support the pontoons of the bridge getting side on to the river (although they can support a well constructed bridge in the correct alignment to the flow) and can get pushed around and out of alignment in a way concrete pillars sunk into the bed can't.\n\n>False, Shahed miss building sized targets all the time, a 4 meter wide targets is virtually impossible to hit for a drone with such CEP. Again literal math.\n\nThey also hit building sized targets all the time too. \n\nLets say they're accurate so that 50% hit within a 100m circle (and I believe they are more accurate than this). Thats 8000m2 more or less. You'd need 2 to hit the circle so they'd have a CEP of 100m.\n\nThe cross section of our 4m bridge going across that circle is 400m2.... So you'd need 40 Shaheeds randomly to guarantee a hit inside the CEP.\n\nAnd as our bridge (but not a normal target) extends outside the CEP, you'd have a fair chance that one of the 20 hitting outside the CEP may hit it as well.\n\nAnd the Shaheeds appear to be much more accurate than that. Accurate anough to hit a building some of the time.\n\nBut anyway, Kaliber's have been shown to be able to hit bridge sized targets.....twice in the case of the mykolaiv bridge.... with a hit percentage somewhere around 20-50% of the time. So you'd almost certainly be hitting it with these rather than Shaheeds.\n\n>irrelevant, the first makes a hit, the second misses the target.\n\nFor the case of any one missile, yes...... but in the case of multiple missiles, no. I think you could guarantee 1 hit per GMLRS fired on the bridge. But also 1 hit per 40 Shaheeds (likely less). And 1 hit per 3-4 Kalibers (as with the other bridge I linked in the other comment).\n\n>Kaliber CEP means Russia will have to expand most of it's stock trying to keep the bridge down\n\nNo, they kept 1 bridge down with 2 hits out of something like 4-8 missiles fired (there were some misses).\n\nThey seem to have enough stocks to be throwing 20-30 at Kyiv/Dnipro/Odessa on a weekly basis, so they've clearly got enough stock to hit this bridge at will. \n\nI suspect anti-sea missiles would have an even higher hit rate, and they also have plenty of them on subs and other surface combatants out on the black sea as well that can hit the Dnipro. Can probably target the tug boats fairly well with these as well.\n\n>Again Pontons sections are supported by boats. Similar to Russian supporting their bridge by tying to the bridge. It works.\n\nThey are until you sink one. Then all the weight that boat used to support gets larded onto the other boats.....plus all the additional force caused by your pontoon bridge no longer being aligned to the flow..... and they being pushed into place by a propeller with a limited power to push back rather than a concrete pillar which is going to be 100% effective at holding any weight there until it snaps in half.",

Ever since they've been keeping a distance.\n\nWhy would they need close runs ? They've been firing the Orthodox JDAMs back 100km or more from the front-line. I doubt they're as accurate as US JDAMs, but a 2km long pontoon bridge would be the kind of target they'd be willing to throw a few at.\n\n>Which would struggle to hit anything smaller than a hospital or a residential block due to poor accuracy. That's why they're used overwhelmingly for terrorist campaign, not against military targets.\n\nThey do struggle to hit small targets. They might have to use multiples, perhaps even well into double figures, to take out a pontoon bridge.\n\nBut if the benefit is stranding 1-2 brigades of heavy armour on the wrong side of a river with no ammo or fuel *or way to retreat* they'd be happy to do so.\n\nI can think of no other target in Ukraine that'd be both as visible/locatable as this.... and as high value.

In fact Mikhail Khodarenok is to this day still seen on state TV, usually used as some sort of foil. But I've seen some clips where he's been allowed to basically talk normally(on Solovyov's show even). Ivashov on the other hand retired shortly after Putin came to power, I think the general sentiment was that he was forced to \"retire\" because he wasn't supportive of Putin/regime, even though he's a staunch nationalist. Another interesting point is that it was Leonid Ivashov who was in charge of the military troops when the crisis in Yugoslavia was occurring in 90s; and there was some tension even back then with him not following the command of the regime.  [More here, if you are interested about that](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/russians062599.htm) this is from 1999.\n\nOh and the link is archived, because for some reason the normal link doesn't work anymore.

It's actually incredible how accurate the predictions are.\n\nedit: just came to this part in the interview:\n\n>When such a statement is made by, for example, [Vladimir] Zhirinovsky, they understand everything and don't consider it an issue. After all the [LDPR] is a small party. In addition, they make their psychotherapeutic evaluation of the \"patient\" [i.e. of Zhirinovsky]. But when such a statement is made by an UR deputy and later it's not contradicted neither by the party, nor by Peskov, the threat is taken quite seriously there. The [UR] is the ruling party, so the Americans rightly attribute such words to the president, to the country's leadership\u2026 One can't do that.\n\nThat is very ironic in hindsight. If you don't know why Ivashov refers to Zhirinovsky as a \"patient\" here, it's because he was kind of crazy at least publicly. He was usually considered to being the Kremlin's court jester. [Here](https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/1496058945475076096) is a clip of him talking about the invasion in december already.

But those who reported only successes had permanent access, and defeats and failures were reduced to petty nuisances of no significance.</p>\n\n<p>The source says that at this point Putin simply stopped receiving &quot;bad news&quot; because the president does not want to hear it.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Putin has no idea how the war is going, because that&#39;s the pattern we&#39;ve seen with all other dictators. Everybody lies all the time, that&#39;s how the system works. Waiting for Steiner&#39;s offensive isn&#39;t some made up thing - it&#39;s a consequence of culture of lying dictatorships create.</p>\n</div>",
