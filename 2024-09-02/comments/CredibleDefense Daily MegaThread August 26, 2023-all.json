But, just a few random things to consider, stretching the definition of relevant here.  \nFirst, UAF/UA is highly dependant upon Western assistance which will eventually \"get on the ballots\" in every single Western country, at one point or another in some shape or form. We've already had significant elections in Europe contending with this issue, remember Macron in 2022. Now think Biden in 2024. Keeping Western audiences who are still following this war, and remember this demographic is key but shrinking steadily, engaged is crucial for Ukraine's interests. Continuously arousing an acute sense of immediate danger is quite an aphrodisiac, no one here is denying their propaganda is rather effective in the West. Up to a degree that I am sure genuinely annoys us all. Ukraine hasn't received enough weapons, they haven't what they'd like to feel comfortable holding such a broad front and they certainly plan on expending quite a bit of materiel in the foreseeable future. This is normal and expected.  \nSecond, a lot of these claimed are transmitted (granted, this isn't the case here - Syrskyi is a top dog) by individual commanders who sure are not liking how little attention and help they've been getting. Remember, this whole area has been a bit ignored ever since Kharkiv Offensive culminated. It is their task to keep this area relatively intact, if they feel that there aren't enough resources and they aren't being heard - they will come out publicly. This is normal, they are simply too worn-out and stretched-thin to cover everything in such a high intensity conflict. We've seen every single country struggle with this during a Total War. And for Ukrainians, this is just that - a Total War. They'd be long gone if the West wasn't kicking them aid, and they know it.  \nThird, (implied) key for continued support for Ukraine is **controlling the flow** of the War, not allowing any **sudden, unexpected failures** at a more strategic level. Remember, their offensive isn't going that well on the paper, they see US officials blaming each other's agencies rather publicly for this apparent failure and furthermore there are significant Russian forces in the area (easy logistics, relatively quiet front for the mobilized to get more acquainted). Allowing their offensive to be seen as a failure along with a **significant unexpected** setback in Kreminna area would bring about a significant amount of political pressure from the West to pursue an avenue of diplomatic resolution. Not only can't they make gains - they are not even in control, imagine all the concern articles that would spawn right out of from it. This is not something neither Ukrainian leadership nor its wider populace believes is in its current interests, pending further developments. These assumptions might not all be true, but they sure are looking plausible to Ukrainians. Remember, West hasn't been that great of a supporter pre-2022 - this is legitimately the first time they are in the position where there is genuine support from the West, and many people are sceptical just how far the aid will go. Minsk-II was literally being broken as it was being signed - Russians didn't adhere to it in Debaltseve. Poroshenko publicly spoke about how he was on the phone communicating with the frontlines, making sure Debaltseve remains standing at the moment of ceasefire. The fact it was a still-born treaty was barely acknowledged in the West. I genuinely think, as non-credible as it were, Trump did in part, however small it might've been, send lethal aid to \"own the libs.\" Something to this effect was a genuinely popular Ukrainian meme back in the day when this happened. It's just a dose of scepticism and cynicism residing in their society that's informing some of their decisions and we have to accept it, it's been 18 months.  Also, we ridiculed the Russians for ignoring the warning signs in Kharkiv - here they are at least acknowledging the prospect and they'll blame it on the lack of aid. They are simply doing what they can.   \nAnd none of these, in my opinion, are particularly unexpected nor embarrassing - it's a Total War on the European soil. That's a massive shock for Europe in of itself. Decades of political and diplomatic efforts were just all shattered, essentially over night. Remember, the Chief of BND was in Kyiv as the war started, it was the Five Eyes who actually had the intel with the full context - not the traditional European leaders, still sceptical of the US post-Iraq-2003-intelligence-fiasco. It was still a shock, as much as you want to ridicule or discard it. A lot of the population in \"Western EU\" didn't really prepare for the fact that they'd wake up, one arbitrary morning, in the state of a rather extensive economic warfare. Inflation has been rampant, at some point over 10 million refugees were hosted all over the EU. And then add Russian draft-dodgers escaping en-masse into the states of the former USSR, like Georgia with its own complicated situation. It's a massive strain for the whole of Europe. Again, Ukraine has taken significant loses in order to hold off numerous and technologically more advanced Russians, no one is doubting they will lose without the Western aid. We haven't seen such a massive war affecting Russia (USSR) or the West, for a very long time. We might not like it - but they are fighting for their survival, their whole society needs to stand together to beat this back, there's egos involved and of course naturally comes the random politicking of which we see only the tid-bits through the lense of Western media. The other side just had a fucking coup attempt, I feel some perspective is warranted here. It's just an unimaginable strain for any society, and I think they are doing a relatively good job of holding it together. Even if it feels stupid to us outsiders, it can't really hurt, can it? Everyone wants to help, it'd be the same anywhere. I don't know, I just feel a little context goes a long way in this discussion. You can't really discuss a war devoid of all the context and politics. I know for a lot of you here there are two great Oceans protecting you, but for some of us there aren't. And for some of us this hits a lot closer to home, and we just let little things like this go. They would happen literally everywhere.",

But, just a few random things to consider, stretching the definition of relevant here.<br/>\nFirst, UAF/UA is highly dependant upon Western assistance which will eventually &quot;get on the ballots&quot; in every single Western country, at one point or another in some shape or form. We&#39;ve already had significant elections in Europe contending with this issue, remember Macron in 2022. Now think Biden in 2024. Keeping Western audiences who are still following this war, and remember this demographic is key but shrinking steadily, engaged is crucial for Ukraine&#39;s interests.

Russia on the other hand can't keep supporting the war for a decade without severely losing out on  the economic dimension; the relative damages are lower, but from the perspective of the regime's survival they are still very high.\n\nI think the most 'reasonable' in terms of realities on the ground solution is that Ukraine abandons some of its eastern provinces; I think this would even be beneficial in some economic ways, because it wouldn't be on Ukraine to rebuild them(though there is the question of the gas fields which are largely concentrated in eastern Ukraine). On the other hand, the most important thing Ukraine *needs* are security guarantees, the only way they get those is if they join NATO or if they literally crush Russia.

Russia on the other hand can&#39;t keep supporting the war for a decade without severely losing out on  the economic dimension; the relative damages are lower, but from the perspective of the regime&#39;s survival they are still very high.</p>\n\n<p>I think the most &#39;reasonable&#39; in terms of realities on the ground solution is that Ukraine abandons some of its eastern provinces; I think this would even be beneficial in some economic ways, because it wouldn&#39;t be on Ukraine to rebuild them(though there is the question of the gas fields which are largely concentrated in eastern Ukraine). On the other hand, the most important thing Ukraine <em>needs</em> are security guarantees, the only way they get those is if they join NATO or if they literally crush Russia. Which one is the most likely? </p>\n\n<p>NATO for 10-15% territory is a good trade at this point. Ukraine doesn&#39;t want to cede any territory, Russia doesn&#39;t want Ukraine in NATO; but it&#39;s still the best outcome in the long term for either side that can realistically be negotiated. All of that said, I think the chances of any sort of such negotiations happening is zilch; both sides&#39; nationalist factions have become more powerful, and they will not stand down for anything.</p>\n</div>",

What <strong>we</strong> need is reasons for them not to come back, like actually having the initial land grab fail.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I&#39;m explaining this to you and not to him because he already understands all of this, he&#39;s lying to you.</p>\n</div>",

People who could afford to stay in the more upscale resorts are going to other, safer destinations.\n\n> After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, a number of countries closed their doors to Russian tourists. The European Union suspended its visa facilitation agreement with Russia, making it harder for Russians to apply for an EU visa. According to the Association of Russian Tour Operators (ATOR), trips by Russians to European countries were down by 88% in the first half of this year compared to the first half of 2019, the last year unaffected by travel bans or pandemic restrictions.

Maxim Grigoriev, who heads a Russian NGO, made multiple speeches to the UN presenting a false study that claimed the humanitarian group the White Helmets \u2013 which operates in Syria \u2013 was running a black market for human organs and had faked chemical attacks by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with whom Russia is allied. **Those claims eventually found their way into a television report on the far-right OANN in the United States, according to open-source materials provided by the official.**\n\nBut the official stressed that the Western voices that eventually became mouthpieces for Russian propaganda were almost certainly unaware of the role they were playing.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this unwitting target is disseminating Russian influence operation, Russian propaganda to their target public,\u201d the US official said. \u201cUltimately, a lot of these are unwitting people \u2014 they remain unaware who is essentially seeding these narratives.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence provides several examples of Russian civilian \u201cco-optees\u201d doing the bidding of the FSB.\n\nOne man, Andrey Stepanenko, founded a media project in 2014 **that sponsored journalists from the US and the West to visit eastern Ukraine and learn \u201cthe alleged truth\u201d about what was happening in the region**. In fact, the FSB directed his efforts and \u201calmost certainly financed the project,\u201d according to the declassified intelligence.\n\nCNN was not able to locate Stepanenko to ask for comment.\n\nThe US official also cited Natalia Burlinova, the founder of a Russian NGO who routinely coordinated FSB-funded public diplomacy efforts aimed at influencing Western views. In 2018, she visited, had meetings and hosted events at multiple US think tanks and universities in New York, Boston and Washington \u2013 work that was funded by the FSB, according to the intelligence. Her conduct was already public: She was indicted earlier this year on charges of conspiring with an FSB officer to act as an illegal agent of Russia inside the United States, although she remains at liberty in Russia.\n\nCNN has reached out to Burlinova.\n\nThe official declined to offer specifics to back up the intelligence community\u2019s assertions that the FSB is funding this kind of operation but noted that once officials were able establish FSB backing, it is easy to trace the narratives they are pushing in open-source materials.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re aware of who these people are and their association with the FSB, by nature of what they\u2019re doing, they have very, very public personas,\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd so I would just say it\u2019s not really difficult to kind of follow the strings.\u201d\n\nThe US official declined to say whether Russia has used these same tactics to try to influence US elections.\n\nThe FSB does use similar tactics to influence political opinion within Russia, according to the intelligence. In one instance, a Russian media figure named Anton Tsvetkov organized protests outside of embassies in Moscow \u2014 including the US Embassy \u2014 at the FSB\u2019s behest. The protests pushed Russia\u2019s narrative of the war in Ukraine, \u201cpromoting the \u2018Ukrainian Nazi\u2019 narrative and blaming the U.S. and its allies for the deaths of children in the Donbass,\u201d while hiding the Russian government\u2019s role, according to the declassified intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of those protests really was \u2026 designed to sell it to the Russian people,\u201d the US official said.",
