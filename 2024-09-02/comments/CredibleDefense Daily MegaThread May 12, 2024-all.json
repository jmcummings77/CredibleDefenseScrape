If you ever heard of Silovikis - the influential cadre of anti-western ideologues who were brought up in the late Soviet and early Russian security system - he is the epitome. He's held this position for the record length of time prior to the events of today, previously being the director of FSB ever since Putin assumed power as PM in 1999. Putin himself, curiously, ascended to Premiership after a brief stint as the Secretary of SC. Depending on where Patrushev lands (I haven't seen any news as to his future) - his removal might be a lot, lot bigger news than Shoigu's reshuffling. He is quite old, pushing a few above 70, so we might be looking at a retirement - if such a thing even exists in such a system.\n\nConsider the position more of a coordination role that encompasses all the faucets of security aspects of the Russian state - now how that will exactly look with Shoigu in position, it's hard to say at this point. He was always extremely spineless and willing to toe the line, an extreme loyalist to anyone in power, that is to say the position might become a lot less influential with him in it, and my guess would be that it would be by design.

It would seem like something you'd want to keep Shoigu away from given his track record, especially given the recent arrest of one of his closest confidants on corruption charges. We might be looking at some internal power struggle taking place, but without more information it's hard to say at this point. I am definitely more a lot interested in what happens to Partrushev.",

Many experts definitely pointed towards Patrushev as being either one of the sources of Putin's outward ideological shift that eventually culminated in the invasion of Ukraine or as someone who was in a complete lockstep with Putin in terms of ideology, but a lot more outspoken and someone who definitely embraced it publicly much sooner than Putin. While it is hard to gauge, from the outside at least, but possibly from the inside as well, just how influential and/or powerful any single individual is in any autocratic/totalitarian system - he was definitely always considered as one of the chief policy makers with regards to 2014 (Crimea and Donbas) and general shift in Russian outlook towards West and Liberal Democracies from late oughties or early teens onwards. Another example is definitely the downing of Prigozhin's plane as you mentioned - if there is someone who was in the loop about it and possibly planned it, it was definitely him. He certainly made the position itself much more powerful, if nothing else than by the virtue of being so close to Putin, but also by being so intimately involved with the inner workings of many of the Russian Security agencies. Some speculated that as Putin gradually isolated himself Patrushev was one of the people who was feeding Putin information from the outside, especially given they were always, in theory, meeting weekly - and for a fair bit of COVID time the Security Council was definitely a lot less populated than before or after COVID. A nice historical tie in would definitely be how Stalin, after Lenin had to step back due to his health concerns, was able to filter some of what came onto Lenin's desk. These types of Silovikis are extremely obsessed with historical parallels and often draw lessons from simplified historical narratives. But, again, It's impossible to say without more details, maybe we'll get more information as to his fate in the coming days, possibly during the confirmation votes for the new MoD and Shoigu.\n\nTo draw a distinction between him and Shoigu (depending on your definition of Siloviki - he might too be considered one of them) - the latter was always considered an extremely loyal member of Putin's circle, but definitely not someone driven by ideology and given that he had no military training to speak of (despite what his Army General uniform might lead you to believe - the rank was not attained on the basis of merit or any actual military experience) he was always seen as a safe pair of hands to handle the more administrative side of the MoD, unlike most of the previous MoDs who were professionals, whilst definitely not being overly ambitious. He was definitely put in the position back in the day in order to steady the ship after the previous Russian MoD (I believe the only other civilian in that position along with Shoigu until today) tried implementing reforms that would see a sizeable reduction of the Russian Military, especially its Officer Corps, and finally put a stop to the endemic corruption plaguing their Military. Shoigu definitely had to alleviate many of those concerns when he was promoted to MoD, hence the continued corruption we are still witnessing. But, moving Shoigu over to another position and then publicly underlining that he would be essentially taking a fair chunk of his previous tasks as MoD with him to his new position leads me to believe that at worst it's a lateral movement in his career, but definitely would read it as some sort of \"approval\" by Putin. The scope of the Secretary of SC will definitely change a fair bit with these new developments, in a way becoming a lot less powerful, but with obviously some new roles attached to it.\n\nIt also leaves me also wondering just what a new civilian MoD would actually be tasked with, since there seems to be a certain degree of overlap between Shoigu's new position and what you'd want a civilian MoD, such as Belousov, actually doing. I guess another interesting thing to look at would be if Gerasimov leaves in the near future, that would then be introducing pretty big changes in both the Civilian and Professional side of the MoD. As of now, all these changes seem to relate mostly to the former, but I'd imagine you'd want the new MoD booting Gerasimov if you were going down that road instead of having Shoigu doing it and then booting him mere days, weeks or months later.",

        "body": "Interesting comment from an Ukrainian Telegram channel which follows the issues about the structure of the Armed Forces in response to the announcement of the creation of 10 new brigades (so far the new 155th Infantry Brigade has been created).\n\nIt essentially confirms what I've always read about the problems at the level of command and structure of Ukrainian brigades and explains the downsides of the current system; like several other Ukrainian sources it pushes the importance of a divisional model similar to the Russian one. While a brigade and a regiment in terms of maneuver units are generally the same, what changes is that the brigade (in both Russia and Ukraine) is a separate unit (\"Okrema\"), while a regiment is a line unit, meaning it lacks additional support units, which are at the divisional level. It's explained how territorial defense battalions are usually separate and have within them numerous officers in support functions but who in fact do almost nothing. For simplicity's sake I generally use the term \u201cseparate\u201d to refer to a battalion that is not organically part of a brigade, but formally the term implies an unit that should be able to manage itself independently, with its own support/logistics units - MilitaryLand explains it well [here](https://militaryland.net/news/what-is-a-separate-unit-in-ukrainian-army/). The major issue that in my opinion it's not considered in this comment is that a divisional system would increase the need for staff officers right where Ukraine is most lacking (i.e. senior commissioned officers). After the comment (translated via DeepL), I will clarify a few points.\n\n>We have created ten thousand million brigades and the same number is on the way\n\n>One of the problems we faced with our army was the problem of growth, in 2022 we had to quickly scale up from peacetime to wartime staffing levels and deploy new units. The first steps were the deployment of several reserve brigades from OR 1 and OR 2, filling 100% of the existing brigades, but there was no further readiness.\n\n>The deployment of the TRO led to the creation of a large number of rifle units with only one mortar battery, which ironically included the most motivated civilians. The management of the TRO units, which in the days before the full-scale war were considered to be the refuge of discharged officers, was not of the highest level. Nowadays, the brigade command of the TRO is rarely used (the number of TRO brigades holding the line in the active combat zone is at best on the fingers of 2 hands) and is essentially just a large number of officers who are busy ensuring the daily activities of a half-empty unit while the battalions and sometimes companies of this unit are fighting under the command of other brigades that can provide effective management and comprehensive support. It is noteworthy that most of the TRO battalions are also separate and require a large number of officers to manage them, while a regular mech battalion of mechanized brigades has fewer officers.\n\n>Instead, no conclusions were drawn: instead of expanding and reformatting the existing experienced units and preserving the statutory battalion-brigade-corps/operational command, uncontrolled creation of new units began, for which there was nowhere to recruit commanders, so as of 2024, we have a chronic staff shortage and people in command positions who should not have been there under any circumstances. The above-mentioned TRO is being put under the knife as an inefficient structure that does not meet modern challenges and tasks.\n\n>What was the way out?\n\n>It's easy to talk about it now, but it would have been more appropriate to use the Russian divisional system of divisions with line regiments for a large number of companies. This would have greatly reduced the need for officers and allowed us to deploy +- the same number of personnel around an effective and well-coordinated core. We would not have had such sharp fluctuations in the combat capability of different brigades, and the old effective brigades that have been in the line since February 2022 would have had more depth in terms of their own reserves and would not have fought endlessly with dowries.\n\n>The basis for this post was an interview with the commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and perhaps a correct assessment of the actions already taken would have prevented us from repeating old mistakes.\n\nhttps://t. me/ukr_sisu/114\n\nSome clarification on the terms. TRO means Territorial Defense Forces. When he says that the number of TDF brigades holding the line can be counted on the fingers of two hands, he means that only a small part of these brigades hold a section of the front line independently (such as the former 100th TDF Brigade in Dibrova near Kreminna until early April, or the 108th and 102nd TDF Brigades in the western and eastern parts of the Polohy sector, respectively), while most TDF brigades see their battalions scattered around and attached to other brigades. \n\nAt the beginning of the war, reservists were called up. OR (Operational Reserve) 1 and OR 2 are the first and second mobilization waves. The first is made up of ATO/JFO veterans and those who have served under a contract since 2014, with the reservists who must be under 40. The second includes those who had their military service since 2014 and older veterans. Once reservists started flowing, several things were implemented, in the order: bringing up to the nominal complement requirement the manpower of the existing brigades; activating the brigades (at that time ghost units) of the Reserve Corps (as well as the 46th Airmobile Brigade); creating several new brigades of the Ground Forces; creating rifle battalions organic to the existing brigades (usually two); creating dozens and dozens of separate rifle battalions (not under the organic subordination to a brigade). Volunteer civilians without experience almost always joined the TDF, which within weeks saw its battalions having more men than the nominal requirement as well as the creation of additional new battalions, until it reached the figure of about 180 territorial defense battalions. Later Ukraine focused on a huge expansion of the number of brigades of the Ground Forces, Air Assault Forces, Marine Corps and National Guard, largely by recruiting additional men and to a lesser extent by bringing in servicemen from the TDF; with the number of brigades exploding between late 2022 and mid 2023. \n\nOne of the downsides of the current system, mentioned in the comment, is the difference in quality between brigades and the fact that brigades often have to fight with \u201cdowries\u201d, i.e. non-organic units fighting under it (e.g. a TDF battalion, a separate rifle battalion or one from an infantry brigade, a detachment of Border Guards, a company tactical group from a Training Center or from the State Transport Special Service, etc.). This implies that a brigade may have a melting pot of subunits under it (amplifying communication problems) or that the organic battalions of a brigade may be deployed in completely different sectors (which doesn't happen to the Russians, except in rare cases). In the Russian system, even the regiments of a division are relatively unlikely to fight in different sectors. Their replenishment system works with soldiers getting transferred from other units and formations in usually company-sized blocks and being organically subordinate to their new brigade, in addition to the constant assignment of new recruits by the distribution units to the brigade that needs them as well as having regiments of the Territorial Forces under their subordination.\n\nMoreover, over the past year Ukraine has created several corps: the 9th, the 10th and very recently the 11th Army Corps, the 7th Air Assault Corps and the 30th Marine Corps, which, however (except for the last one), don't seem to have any real autonomy (meaning holding the responsibility for a sector, with the brigades belonging to the corps actually fighting there) and seem to be just formations that take care of support functions, just like the operational commands. The current de facto chain of command in the UAF is this: brigade --> Operational-Tactical Group --> Operational-Strategic Group --> General Staff (a much leaner chain than the Russian one, by the way).",

There has long been a debate, well not really a debate but more of a discussion, in the US Army about the division-regiment force structure especially at West Point. I don't have the time to get into it fully maybe I'll come back to it as some other time but the basic summary is that you don't just do a divisional approach in a large scale war, you still need ace battalions and brigades for combat missions. Yes with the divisional focus you get more cohesion, less reliance on staff officers especially at the brigade level and can better employ an economy of force to your objectives. The downsides are that you lose quite a bit of flexibility, independence in action, need more staffing in your support functions and need a strong NCO corps. Ukraine will need to incorporate some of that divisional level organization to their army but the bigger challenge has been how much they've grown. They had a 200,000 strong standing army before the war began and it quickly ballooned up to 700,000 or whatever it is today in the middle of a war. I think very few casual observers truly appreciate just how hard it is for any organization let alone a military in the middle of a high intensity war against one of the largest and heavily armed land forces in the world, to scale up that much in such a short time frame. If you talk to field grade officers up in any military and I suspect the professional Russian officers will say this too, they will tell you just how impressively the Ukrainians have managed. I'm not suggesting that the AFU hasn't made and continues to make mistakes but that organizationally it's a very, very difficult thing to get the balance right even in peace times.",

I have nothing but respect for Commander Yaroslavski, but frontline soldiers are a horrible source for information about a broader battle. Their view of the war is too narrow and too emotionally charged. Yaroslavski probably lost people he knew retaking that land from Russian forces during the Kharkiv counteroffensive. Of course he thinks the line should have been defended up to the border. But doing so would have required many more soldiers to sit exposed for months or years to Russian drone surveillance and artillery fire.

Therefore, it is impractical to construct fortifications directly on the border.

I have nothing but respect for Commander Yaroslavski, but frontline soldiers are a horrible source for information about a broader battle. Their view of the war is too narrow and too emotionally charged. Yaroslavski probably lost people he knew retaking that land from Russian forces during the Kharkiv counteroffensive. Of course he thinks the line should have been defended up to the border.

To my understanding, Operation Poseidon Archer has been extremely limited to [tactical targets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_missile_strikes_in_Yemen).  It is not at all obvious that it is even meant to influnece the Houthis intent for further attacks (after all, a missile is going to blow up whether it is destroyed on the ground, or at its target) --- merely attempting to prevent future attacks.\n\nIndeed, there are examples of air campaigns being operationally decisive.  What is it about Yemen that prevents 1) an air campaign from being decisive, and 2) prevents an air campaign from being done in coordination with Yemeni ground forces?",
