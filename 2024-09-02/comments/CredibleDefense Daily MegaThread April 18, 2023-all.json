This definitely warrants discussion, namely in a defense-themed subforum.</p>\n</div>",

I said such claims are more suspect, given the relatively higher risk of potential disinformation or manipulation entering the discourse around emotionally charged allegations, and also the relatively low confidence I have in any source coming directly out of Russia at this time. Even with sources that have a relatively long history of credibility inside Russia, the security state has tightened the screws dramatically over the last year, and the potential for someone to be coerced into enabling a disinformation op is that much higher. And certainly there is a long-running history of similar disinformation ops by the Russian intelligence agencies and their Soviet ancestors. So I think it's reasonable to wait for independent confirmation before getting too invested in these particular assertions.\n\n> OPs entire point was that it hasn\u2019t been. Was it even reported on this subreddit previously?\n\nI have seen people make strong statements about this all over Reddit. Pretty sure I've seen comments here and there on this sub, but I haven't paid much attention to them precisely because of my aforementioned desire to wait for stronger confirmation. In any case, it's hardly like the story is being suppressed, and [people's reactions are quite strong where it is being discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonCredibleDefense/comments/12qdkjd/that_interview_yea_that_shit_is_gonna_haunt_my/).\n\nI imagine the topic is not being discussed much here because the claims provide little if any additional insight into defense issues. Russian brutality tactics are well-established, and it does not seem these interviews shift much if anything from a purely defense perspective. \n\nFurther, I'd argue the claims in the videos are currently not entirely credible because they have not been verified by any third-party, and any claim from the Russians during this war is inherently suspect, as I mentioned above. If Shoigu tells me the sky is blue, I look out my front window to double check. Credible reporting on the topic has come with the caveat that none of the claims can be confirmed at this time. [For example, per CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/17/europe/wagner-commanders-russia-kill-children-intl-hnk/index.html),\n\n>  CNN cannot independently verify their claims or identities in the videos but has obtained Russian penal documents showing they were released on presidential pardon in September and August of 2022. \n\nAgain, I am not claiming that the statements made in the interviews are false or fabricated. In fact, I suspect the claims are more or less entirely accurate, plus or minus honest misperceptions, small self-preserving lies, or other minor discrepancies from the objective truth. However, I do think the combination of the claims' relatively low relevance to this subreddit's focus and the currently unconfirmed status of those claims makes it not a great fit for this thread.

It sounds like you think I meant something else.

I would agree that emotionality around the topic is not relevant evidence for evaluating the truth of the underlying claims. What happened happened, regardless of how people feel about it.\n\nThat said, the high emotionality of the claims certainly should be a red flag that triggers at least a degree of elevated caution in the current information environment. It seems perfectly reasonable to react by investigating and evaluating other indicia of the source's credibility to allay that concern, especially in the context of a high intensity information war. In this case, the claims are coming from a source of unknown reliability. That is another red flag. Lack of independent verification is a third.\n\nNone of which is enough for me to dismiss the claims outright, not by a long shot. But it is enough to make me want to reserve judgment until such time as some of those flags can be cleared up, despite what my intuition may tell me about the underlying truth of the claims. \"The mark of an educated mind is the ability to entertain an idea without accepting it.\" \n\nAnd ultimately the question that triggered my response was why is no one discussing it here. There's nothing stopping us from discussing it tomorrow, if further evidence develops corroborating the claims, and in the meantime we can avoid falling for a potential disinformation operation just by being a little patient. I think the same answer probably covers why you haven't heard much on the news about it.

They slightly beat betting markets over a small sample (4 elections).\n\nIt wasn't 4 elections it was 4 election cycles, with hundreds of individual races analyzed.

And the potential Dem candidates who are extremely popular with Dems tend to be off-putting to independents or conservatives. \n\nWhich IMO is why Biden's putting himself forward for another term; he recognizes that there's nobody with the name-recognition to go against Trump. \n\nThe danger for the Dems is two-fold. Should Biden's health rapidly deteriorate (or worse), they've got nobody with name-recognition to put in his place. And should Biden get the nom and win the Presidency again, the Dems run the risk of becoming complacent and not aggressively promoting future candidates (they can't let Biden hog the limelight over a hypothetical second term. They need to start promoting young folk).\n\nThe question then becomes whether a post-Trump Republican President will be as \"cozy\" with Russia as Trump is. It's hard to tell. Forty years ago the Republicans were the go-to guys for Russia bashing.

And the potential Dem candidates who are extremely popular with Dems tend to be off-putting to independents or conservatives. </p>\n\n<p>Which IMO is why Biden&#39;s putting himself forward for another term; he recognizes that there&#39;s nobody with the name-recognition to go against Trump. </p>\n\n<p>The danger for the Dems is two-fold. Should Biden&#39;s health rapidly deteriorate (or worse), they&#39;ve got nobody with name-recognition to put in his place. And should Biden get the nom and win the Presidency again, the Dems run the risk of becoming complacent and not aggressively promoting future candidates (they can&#39;t let Biden hog the limelight over a hypothetical second term. They need to start promoting young folk).</p>\n\n<p>The question then becomes whether a post-Trump Republican President will be as &quot;cozy&quot; with Russia as Trump is. It&#39;s hard to tell. Forty years ago the Republicans were the go-to guys for Russia bashing.

        "body": "I have some questions about Korean involvement in a Taiwan crisis that Inwould like to discuss. I preface the questions with the following:\n\nSouth Korea, alongside Japan (who has publicly committed to involvement) is the closest significant US ally to Taiwan. The ROKDF posses a sizeable and highly capable blue water navy and air force, a large and capable army, and houses 20,000 American personnel across USAF-Korea and US Army-Korea.\n\nOf relevance to a Taiwan crisis, the USAF-Korea 7th AF operating from Osan and Kunsan hardened air bases provide access and support to\n\n* 1 SQN of A-10s (25 FS)\n*  3 SQNs of F-16s (35th, 36th, and 80th FS)\n\nBase hardening of Korean bases which is largely absent from bases in Japan and Guam mean that as a war progresses through attacks on Guam and Japan, the relative importance of Korean bases and forces will increase dramatically\n\nThe broader ROKAF further includes\n\n* 40 F-35s\n* 167 F-16s\n* 59 F-15s\n* Additional fighters/attacks that would largely be dedicated to securing against North Korean attack (F5s, F4s, Kai FA-50s, KF-21s)\n\nThey are of course under threat from North Korea, which is a Chinese/Russian ally and in an expanding war a possible co-belligerent.\n\nTherefore, my questions:\n\n1. What would be the likelihood of South Korea being involved militarily in a Taiwan war? What factors would generate a Korean decision to participate in the shooting? Chinese and North Korean threats? Relationships with Japan, USA and Taiwan? \n2. What would be the likelihood of South Korea being involved in a Taiwan Blockade that is short of kinetic warfare? Involvement if any could range from legal and diplomatic protests or sanctions, or on the higher end either individually or together with the allied force escorting ships or convoys into and out of Taiwan in upscaled FONOPs daring China to fire the first shot/ram the first vessel and start the war for real\n3. What factors would cause China to avoid attacks in Korea and Japan even during a shooting war in Taiwan? Is China concerned by the prospects of escalation into a regional war as opposed to a limited Taiwan centric amphibious and air campaign. Do the addition of ROKDF and JSDF combat forces, especially air, naval and missile forces, pose a substantial threat that China would be concerned by? Attacks by North Korea can be safely assumed to spillover into direct Chinese involvement when occurring simultaneous with a shooting war in Taiwan, even if such operations remain geographically concentrated in Their own theatre surrounding Korea\n4.  What factors would cause China to greenlight attacks in Korea and Japan even during a shooting war in Taiwan? Is the elimination of the 5th and 7th Air Forces worth a resumption of the Korean War at scale? Is North Korea considered considerably controllable and reliable in such an event? Is North Korea considered a viable expendable force of cannon fodder? Does China aim simply to destroy and tie down allied forces, or do they actually want the North to succeed and provide support accordingly even during their own Taiwan campaign?",

                    "body": ">\tNow, on a NET basis, are Americans a beneficiary of the USD being that reference currency? I mean, there are tons of studies done on this topic, and the answer has generally been a \u2018yes\u2019.\n\nIf I get a net gain from being paid because I\u2019m working vs not working, it still makes sense to say that I\u2019m worse off than I would be if I was being paid more for my work. I think this is what the person you responded to means when they say working class Americans aren\u2019t the party that is the recipient of the ***outsized*** benefit (the most outsized benefit) of the USD being the reference currency. Do Americans benefit from it? Yes, but in the same way that workers at Google (or insert other big tech co.) benefit from being paid a salary by Google. Google employees are compensated much more than workers in other industries/sectors, but Google (as an entity - for ease of communication, I\u2019m personifying the results of the aggregate decision-making of the execs and other relevant forces here into one entity/agent) is going to prioritize stabilizing the C suite (executive functionality) first in worsening economic conditions before stabilizing the individuals it employs. In other words, Google employees were beneficiaries of Google\u2019s recent dominance, but they still are a harmed party if Google faces increasing financial pressure because they rested on their laurels and came into thinking that they were intrinsically dominant (i.e., that their dominance was something they deserved and earned just for existing) and performs mass layoffs and outsources to cheaper labor markets while the exec\u2019s lives change very minimally, and often for the better.\n\nThe concern for Americans in the context of USD being the global reference currency is that any losses that arise out of the USD\u2019s weakening role/influence will be sustained by the workers first and by the economic and political decision makers (e.g., the class of society that engineered things like [Bretton Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system)) only after that.\n\n\n\n>\tDoes the financial system derive an outsized benefit from that hegemony? Sure. But it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t a number of sectors that also don\u2019t benefit significantly. The tech behemoths, such as Apple and Amazon, also derive huge benefits from this arrangement, as do firms like Coke and JNJ, and the biggest relative benefactor of them all: the energy sector.\n\nI\u2019m not sure this is a helpful dichotomy to introduce, between the financial system and other \u2018sectors\u2019 besides finance. I think the person you responded to would be reasonable if they said that tech and energy is squarely what they are talking about. These are companies that are benefiting. Things would be different if company profit was allocated more proportionally between exec and worker, but because the inevitable trend is to centralize profit at the exec level, it\u2019s really the company execs who have the *OUTSIZED* benefit from the hegemony. The rest of America has *minimized* benefit.\n\nThe reasoning you are outlining is refined and flows logically, but it\u2019s not comprehensive in the sense that it neglects to consider that the political realities on the ground impose unavoidable constraints on the economic picture you\u2019re painting (and painting very masterfully, I might add). Things would be different, for instance, if the U.S.\u2019s political and legal framework had *different* grounding that imposed *different* biases for where profit/surplus value flows on the gradient between the most proximal to state autonomy (governmental entities, and corporate entities that perform functions necessary for the state\u2019s existence, like transportation (Uber, Amazon, etc..) and info organization/access/creation (Google, Academia writ-large, think tanks, etc\u2026) and the most distal/distant to state autonomy (the unemployed, children, elderly, the ill and homeless). In other words, if value were distributed more evenly, it would be less concerning that America may lose value from weakening of the USD in this way. But because things are as they are, the people who are the first to face whatever value deficit arises are regular Americans.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Now, on a NET basis, are Americans a beneficiary of the USD being that reference currency? I mean, there are tons of studies done on this topic, and the answer has generally been a \u2018yes\u2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I get a net gain from being paid because I\u2019m working vs not working, it still makes sense to say that I\u2019m worse off than I would be if I was being paid more for my work. I think this is what the person you responded to means when they say working class Americans aren\u2019t the party that is the recipient of the <strong><em>outsized</em></strong> benefit (the most outsized benefit) of the USD being the reference currency. Do Americans benefit from it? Yes, but in the same way that workers at Google (or insert other big tech co.) benefit from being paid a salary by Google. Google employees are compensated much more than workers in other industries/sectors, but Google (as an entity - for ease of communication, I\u2019m personifying the results of the aggregate decision-making of the execs and other relevant forces here into one entity/agent) is going to prioritize stabilizing the C suite (executive functionality) first in worsening economic conditions before stabilizing the individuals it employs. In other words, Google employees were beneficiaries of Google\u2019s recent dominance, but they still are a harmed party if Google faces increasing financial pressure because they rested on their laurels and came into thinking that they were intrinsically dominant (i.e., that their dominance was something they deserved and earned just for existing) and performs mass layoffs and outsources to cheaper labor markets while the exec\u2019s lives change very minimally, and often for the better.</p>\n\n<p>The concern for Americans in the context of USD being the global reference currency is that any losses that arise out of the USD\u2019s weakening role/influence will be sustained by the workers first and by the economic and political decision makers (e.g., the class of society that engineered things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods</a>) only after that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does the financial system derive an outsized benefit from that hegemony? Sure. But it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t a number of sectors that also don\u2019t benefit significantly. The tech behemoths, such as Apple and Amazon, also derive huge benefits from this arrangement, as do firms like Coke and JNJ, and the biggest relative benefactor of them all: the energy sector.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure this is a helpful dichotomy to introduce, between the financial system and other \u2018sectors\u2019 besides finance.

        "body": "I've been considering what an optimal strategy for the PRC would be vis-a-vis Taiwan, with the endgoal being political control of the island--to better understand what the government and PLAN are intending with their various diplomatic and political moves lately, and working backwards from there. \n\nFirst, we need to define what political control means. It could mean, in the first: total sublimation to Beijing, with Communist Party cadres running the show from the lowliest apartment complex to the senior executive leadership of the island. If Xi could snap his fingers like some god and make things so, he'd have this outcome. I do think this is the ideal 'end state', but everyone knows that it can only come out of either total conquest or some acclimation on the part of Taiwan's present government.\n\nTo tackle total conquest first, it's obvious what is preventing the PRC from an immediate invasion: Taiwan's own military and, more importantly, the de facto US military alliance. Both strengths can be neutralized by neutralizing the alliance--Taiwan is dependent on arms imports from the US to be strategically viable as an ally, and Taiwan alone cannot survive an invasion from the mainland.\n\nA straight-up, dog-eat-dog fight is folly and needs much more time to build up strength--much as Putin's invasion has shown, you can't expect to beat a US-allied force quickly and easily. Even had '3 days to Kyiv' been successful, Putin would be dealing with an endless insurgency and would be in much the same position he's in today. Plus--an actual shooting war with the US bears potential catastrophe, with no guarantee of success. If there's one thing you can guarantee a Marxist knows, it's history. They've read all the diaries, all the official war records, of past opponents to the US, all thinking they could be the ones to defeat the Americans--all of them ultimately wrong, from the British, to the South, to the Spaniards and Germans (the latter twice over), and finally, the Soviets and the thousand proxy battles fought hence. The US has never lost a straight fight--it only cedes ground when the political calculus changes (Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq). \n\nWhat this means is that if China wants to beat the US--they need to beat it politically and diplomatically first, and everything else will follow from that. For Taiwan, this means decoupling the US militarily from the island nation--first by removing the security guarantee, and next by restricting the types of imports Taiwan gets from the US and allies. Once that is done--it may take years, it may take decades--but Taiwan is as good as gone for the West. With no possible method of self-defense, Taiwan will then increasingly tie itself closer to the mainland--integrating trade, currency, government ministries, and finally, the ROC army itself. Like I said, that could take decades, but once the ball is rolling down that hill, it will be impossible to stop.\n\nHow then can the PRC secure this future? Well, let's take a look at their recent actions and try to understand them from the senior leaderships' perspective. At a glance, here's what they've been up to lately, plus my thoughts on their perspective:\n\n* End of Zero Covid. This one is obvious: the policy had run on too long, was unpopular and run poorly, and was hurting economic growth. Now that it's over, the PRC's growing again, posting high positive gdp growth (4.5% in q1 gdp over last year). This allays fears from internal and external investors who have been doubting China's economic strengths since zero covid started.\n\n* Macron and the EU. I think this was a real coup for Xi, the fruits of which have yet to fully bear out--as long as it works. The idea here is plain: Macron will lead the EU (and NATO nations inside it) to stay neutral in the event of a conflict in the East China Sea. Germany will go along, as they are quite reliant on Chinese trade and moreover, have already committed their tiny military to European defense first and foremost. And as France and Germany go, so goes the rest of Europe. You'll have outliers, of course--think the Baltic states, who, despite the poverty of their forces, may still send very very limited aid, or the UK, but they won't tip the balance economically or militarily in any convincing way.\n\n* The Middle East diplomatic coups. We're seeing such a flurry of diplomatic activity in the Middle East that we might as well be calling it a diplomatic revolution. Things we've been dreaming about for years are coming to fruition relatively quickly, all guided by China's hand: peace in Syria, peace between Iran and Saudi Arabia, peace in Yemen, and perhaps many other things which have yet to bubble up. It may not be the peace we want (especially in Syria), but it is peace, and the peoples and nations of that region will be extremely grateful for an end to endless war. China's deft hand in securing friendships in this area means that not only will they stay neutral, but they will continue to sell energy to China, despite whatever the US demands (as we've seen, the Saudis and other so-called allies are all too happy to undermine US foreign policy).\n\n* Military drills and the rumbling of war. Other than keeping the military up to shape, these drills are meant to be a psychological and economic blow to Taiwan. And judged on that metric, they've been very successful. Not only is the TSMC been hampered by US actions, but trade and investment in Taiwan is quickly getting less profitable and more expensive. At a very plain level: you're not gonna open a new office in a city that may very well soon be a burned out husk. China's drills are going to continue to hurt Taiwan's economy, and the palpable fear that a potential invasion creates is going to sow much chaos domestically.\n\n* Continued support for Russia. Even if China only sends enough industrial support to keep Russia stable and little else, as long as it is enough to keep the war going and thus NATO distracted, they'll keep doing so. In the event of a war in the Pacific, the US is going to want every single asset transferred there--only they can't afford to do so, not while Russia remains a palpable threat.\n\n* Timing, I think, is also key. There's a presidential election in both Taiwan and the US in 2024--and the wise move would be to sow maximum chaos during the height of both elections to ensure the response remains fractured.\n\nAnd here, I think, is where the victory conditions could be met. At the height of the chaos, with Europe and the Middle East neutral (as well as the rest of the world minus the US, AUKUS, and of course Taiwan), with the Russo-Ukrainian War still sucking up most attention & resources, with Taiwan's economy trending further downwards, the PRC will issue a ban on US military imports to the island. As I've said before, it's the Cuban Missile Crisis, but in reverse. US warships will steam to the red line, and then, like the USSR, America will blink. Historians will debate for the rest of time the why and the how, but the answer should be obvious: the US would be fighting virtually alone in an area it doesn't have numerical superiority, against a foe that can kill thousands of servicemembers. To really win, the President would have to put America on a full war footing--but in the middle of an election, with Taiwan so very far away, America will have to rather painfully blink.\n\nFrom there: the other dominoes fall. Without US imports, the US security guarantee becomes a paper tiger. With that, the hope of any independence dies, and Taiwan eventually gets subsumed into the PRC's government.\n\nThis is just my subjective read on Xi's plans and intentions. A lot of people still think it's going to be D-Day 2.0--the largest invasion fleet we've ever seen--and it might be (the 2027 goal is credible for that). But why spend all that blood and treasure when with a bluff and a threat, you can conquer the island without a drop? \n\nAssuming this is the game plan, how could the US counter it? Well, I don't know if we can. Not really, not without avoiding a bloody war. Sometimes, mistakes are made over years that, when compounded, make certain outcomes almost inevitable. \n\nTo take a common example everyone knows about: Germany in WW2. It didn't matter what they did technologically, militarily, diplomatically, economically, or otherwise after they invaded the USSR: the war was lost as soon as they crossed the border. They were already trending to defeat with US aid to the Allies, but the first nail in the coffin came in June 1941. Every single subsequent defeat was just another nail, leading to the inevitable conclusion in May 1945. \n\nTo bring us back to the modern age: nothing the US does today can undo decades of deindustrialization and the very related subsequent buildup of China as an economic superpower. Nothing we do today can do undo the trillions wasted in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the trillions we continue to waste due to poor economic products and planning (NFTs are the perfect example of private capital being extremely wasteful, I think). For diplomacy, nothing Biden does today can undo decades of unconstructive work in Europe and the Middle East. You can't hit an undo button once you've renamed French Fries to Freedom Fries, to use the most crass example.\n\nIf there's any consolation to offer to the heartened 'democracy warriors' on this subreddit, it's that no plan survives contact with the enemy. Tomorrow, an antsy PRC captain could sink a Taiwanese ship. All of a sudden, the balance flips. The PRC is seen as the aggressor, like Putin, and the US is able to use that inciting event to rally the Western world to Taiwan's defense. That would forestall if not prevent the pseudo-blockade. Of course, that is not endsieg, merely the end of this act of the conflict. The next act might indeed see a full blown-out war, but we'll at least have a bit more time until that becomes truly possible (2027, or 2035 at the latest).",

Both strengths can be neutralized by neutralizing the alliance--Taiwan is dependent on arms imports from the US to be strategically viable as an ally, and Taiwan alone cannot survive an invasion from the mainland.</p>\n\n<p>A straight-up, dog-eat-dog fight is folly and needs much more time to build up strength--much as Putin&#39;s invasion has shown, you can&#39;t expect to beat a US-allied force quickly and easily. Even had &#39;3 days to Kyiv&#39; been successful, Putin would be dealing with an endless insurgency and would be in much the same position he&#39;s in today. Plus--an actual shooting war with the US bears potential catastrophe, with no guarantee of success. If there&#39;s one thing you can guarantee a Marxist knows, it&#39;s history. They&#39;ve read all the diaries, all the official war records, of past opponents to the US, all thinking they could be the ones to defeat the Americans--all of them ultimately wrong, from the British, to the South, to the Spaniards and Germans (the latter twice over), and finally, the Soviets and the thousand proxy battles fought hence. The US has never lost a straight fight--it only cedes ground when the political calculus changes (Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq). </p>\n\n<p>What this means is that if China wants to beat the US--they need to beat it politically and diplomatically first, and everything else will follow from that. For Taiwan, this means decoupling the US militarily from the island nation--first by removing the security guarantee, and next by restricting the types of imports Taiwan gets from the US and allies. Once that is done--it may take years, it may take decades--but Taiwan is as good as gone for the West. With no possible method of self-defense, Taiwan will then increasingly tie itself closer to the mainland--integrating trade, currency, government ministries, and finally, the ROC army itself. Like I said, that could take decades, but once the ball is rolling down that hill, it will be impossible to stop.</p>\n\n<p>How then can the PRC secure this future? Well, let&#39;s take a look at their recent actions and try to understand them from the senior leaderships&#39; perspective. At a glance, here&#39;s what they&#39;ve been up to lately, plus my thoughts on their perspective:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>End of Zero Covid. This one is obvious: the policy had run on too long, was unpopular and run poorly, and was hurting economic growth. Now that it&#39;s over, the PRC&#39;s growing again, posting high positive gdp growth (4.5% in q1 gdp over last year). This allays fears from internal and external investors who have been doubting China&#39;s economic strengths since zero covid started.</p></li>\n<li><p>Macron and the EU. I think this was a real coup for Xi, the fruits of which have yet to fully bear out--as long as it works. The idea here is plain: Macron will lead the EU (and NATO nations inside it) to stay neutral in the event of a conflict in the East China Sea. Germany will go along, as they are quite reliant on Chinese trade and moreover, have already committed their tiny military to European defense first and foremost. And as France and Germany go, so goes the rest of Europe. You&#39;ll have outliers, of course--think the Baltic states, who, despite the poverty of their forces, may still send very very limited aid, or the UK, but they won&#39;t tip the balance economically or militarily in any convincing way.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Middle East diplomatic coups. We&#39;re seeing such a flurry of diplomatic activity in the Middle East that we might as well be calling it a diplomatic revolution. Things we&#39;ve been dreaming about for years are coming to fruition relatively quickly, all guided by China&#39;s hand: peace in Syria, peace between Iran and Saudi Arabia, peace in Yemen, and perhaps many other things which have yet to bubble up. It may not be the peace we want (especially in Syria), but it is peace, and the peoples and nations of that region will be extremely grateful for an end to endless war. China&#39;s deft hand in securing friendships in this area means that not only will they stay neutral, but they will continue to sell energy to China, despite whatever the US demands (as we&#39;ve seen, the Saudis and other so-called allies are all too happy to undermine US foreign policy).</p></li>\n<li><p>Military drills and the rumbling of war. Other than keeping the military up to shape, these drills are meant to be a psychological and economic blow to Taiwan. And judged on that metric, they&#39;ve been very successful. Not only is the TSMC been hampered by US actions, but trade and investment in Taiwan is quickly getting less profitable and more expensive. At a very plain level: you&#39;re not gonna open a new office in a city that may very well soon be a burned out husk. China&#39;s drills are going to continue to hurt Taiwan&#39;s economy, and the palpable fear that a potential invasion creates is going to sow much chaos domestically.</p></li>\n<li><p>Continued support for Russia. Even if China only sends enough industrial support to keep Russia stable and little else, as long as it is enough to keep the war going and thus NATO distracted, they&#39;ll keep doing so. In the event of a war in the Pacific, the US is going to want every single asset transferred there--only they can&#39;t afford to do so, not while Russia remains a palpable threat.</p></li>\n<li><p>Timing, I think, is also key. There&#39;s a presidential election in both Taiwan and the US in 2024--and the wise move would be to sow maximum chaos during the height of both elections to ensure the response remains fractured.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And here, I think, is where the victory conditions could be met. At the height of the chaos, with Europe and the Middle East neutral (as well as the rest of the world minus the US, AUKUS, and of course Taiwan), with the Russo-Ukrainian War still sucking up most attention &amp; resources, with Taiwan&#39;s economy trending further downwards, the PRC will issue a ban on US military imports to the island. As I&#39;ve said before, it&#39;s the Cuban Missile Crisis, but in reverse. US warships will steam to the red line, and then, like the USSR, America will blink. Historians will debate for the rest of time the why and the how, but the answer should be obvious: the US would be fighting virtually alone in an area it doesn&#39;t have numerical superiority, against a foe that can kill thousands of servicemembers. To really win, the President would have to put America on a full war footing--but in the middle of an election, with Taiwan so very far away, America will have to rather painfully blink.</p>\n\n<p>From there: the other dominoes fall. Without US imports, the US security guarantee becomes a paper tiger. With that, the hope of any independence dies, and Taiwan eventually gets subsumed into the PRC&#39;s government.</p>\n\n<p>This is just my subjective read on Xi&#39;s plans and intentions. A lot of people still think it&#39;s going to be D-Day 2.0--the largest invasion fleet we&#39;ve ever seen--and it might be (the 2027 goal is credible for that). But why spend all that blood and treasure when with a bluff and a threat, you can conquer the island without a drop? </p>\n\n<p>Assuming this is the game plan, how could the US counter it? Well, I don&#39;t know if we can. Not really, not without avoiding a bloody war. Sometimes, mistakes are made over years that, when compounded, make certain outcomes almost inevitable. </p>\n\n<p>To take a common example everyone knows about: Germany in WW2. It didn&#39;t matter what they did technologically, militarily, diplomatically, economically, or otherwise after they invaded the USSR: the war was lost as soon as they crossed the border. They were already trending to defeat with US aid to the Allies, but the first nail in the coffin came in June 1941. Every single subsequent defeat was just another nail, leading to the inevitable conclusion in May 1945. </p>\n\n<p>To bring us back to the modern age: nothing the US does today can undo decades of deindustrialization and the very related subsequent buildup of China as an economic superpower. Nothing we do today can do undo the trillions wasted in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the trillions we continue to waste due to poor economic products and planning (NFTs are the perfect example of private capital being extremely wasteful, I think). For diplomacy, nothing Biden does today can undo decades of unconstructive work in Europe and the Middle East. You can&#39;t hit an undo button once you&#39;ve renamed French Fries to Freedom Fries, to use the most crass example.</p>\n\n<p>If there&#39;s any consolation to offer to the heartened &#39;democracy warriors&#39; on this subreddit, it&#39;s that no plan survives contact with the enemy. Tomorrow, an antsy PRC captain could sink a Taiwanese ship. All of a sudden, the balance flips. The PRC is seen as the aggressor, like Putin, and the US is able to use that inciting event to rally the Western world to Taiwan&#39;s defense. That would forestall if not prevent the pseudo-blockade. Of course, that is not endsieg, merely the end of this act of the conflict. The next act might indeed see a full blown-out war, but we&#39;ll at least have a bit more time until that becomes truly possible (2027, or 2035 at the latest).</p>\n</div>",

All of them, in public, in private everywhere. Check what the hand is doing not what the mouth is saying, just like with magicians. French is investing into its MIC. They were an old, probably the oldest US ally. They will back the US. However, how much will be depending on the economic situation within the EU. They took the brunt of the damage with russia. Their support against China will be significantly less, but their actual military support is that they can guard themselves against a weakened russia, allowing US forces to pull back. They will probably buy Chinese goods on the cheap, just like India and China does with russia, while on the UN, they will burn China. As they have to, in case of an invasion. But to be honest, EU expeditionary capabilities are minimal, other then French very little could be sent. UK might be a different horse, but their support would be minimal as well. Maybe stronger on the sanctions. Poles might be similar. \n* Middle east:\n   * peace in Syria - What?\n   *  Iran and Saudi Arabia - Opening of an embassy. \n   *  Yemen - For years in the making, very little to do with China. Became a ruined country existing mostly on paper.\n   * will be extremely grateful for an end to endless war - Ohhh boy, yeah, that is just delusional. It is still the most war torn place on Earth. Sudan is flaring up, with who knows what else down the pipe.\n   * nothing Biden does today can undo decades of unconstructive work in Europe and the Middle East - True, but EU has never been disconnected from the US. Hell, we are copying their culture. If you think there is a wedge between the US and the EU, you don't comprehend the world of geopolitics. On the middle east. You are entirely correct. Other then the peace part of course.\n* Military drills and the rumbling of war - The main goal of such actions is tat you can mask your actual attack as just another drill. You get some experience, but they also cost a lot of money. The investment part is just not true. TSMC tech is still the very top, and doing a good 33% better then IBM in the past 5 years. Their tech transfer and factory building in the US is probably part of a defense pact. Largest foreign investment in the past 25 years have been in June 2022. Your entire conclusion is total BS. Lets take a little look on their Gross GDP:\n   * 2018 - 609.2 Billion USD\n   * 2020 - 669.25\n   * 2022 - 828.66\n   * I hope one day my country would be seeing the economic pressure of the Chinese military and be in such a bad shape as Taiwan ....\n* Continued support for Russia. - This has been discussed before, countless times. The two war require very different equipment, but there won't be a Chinese attack while the russian war is going on. If they would be planning it, there would have been moves by now. China is waiting and siphoning russia dry, to make it a junior partner in its alliance structure. Then if they would like to attack, they will let russia get up after their humiliation a little and will leverage their military production for their war as russia will be desperate to sell their stuff.\n* Timing 2024 - Yeah, lets do that when the political tensions are the highest in a country. Good plan.\n\nYou left out Japan, their fleet alone is a threat to the PLAN and they have everything to fear from a China challenged pacific.\n\nUS will blink - That is just the plain stupidest thing to conclude. The ussr blinked, cause they were the under dog. US history is telling us that they just don't do that. Cause they would lose one of their most valuable asset, their reputation of not blinking. I don't say they don't lose, but they are stubborn as hell.\n\nAll in all, I would say that the basis of your analysis is good, the rest is bad or very bad. China might attack, but that will end faster then the russo-Ukraine war, mainly cause of Taiwan being an island. The best path they can do is the slow political assimilation, buying in to the \"reconciliation\" party and pushing their agenda and narrative as much as they can and slowly trying to grab Taiwan as an ally with popular support.

I believe this context is important because I have observed that some individuals in this subreddit may not fully understand how corruption in Ukraine works, or the broader political relationships at play. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s worth considering the pro-Russian disinformation campaign that often exaggerates cases of misappropriated funds.</p>\n\n<p>However, the story I shared provides a concrete example of  funds being questionably allocated. When I initially provided a brief summary, some people questioned the validity of my claims. As a result, I decided to provide a more detailed explanation. However, it seems that this has resulted in some individuals deeming the topic to be off-topic for this discussion.</p>\n\n<p>But judging by the downvote counter, and the three replies, two by moderators. I will concede and remove the comments.</p>\n</div>",
