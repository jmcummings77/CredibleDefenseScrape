Even the most patriotic Nigerian will tell you that it is a country that is rife with corruption and cronyism at every level, government and military. Like a lot of African countries there is also deep, generational tribal and religious conflicts that still dictate modern politics. \n\nThere is also Boko Haram, the Islamist insurgency that has terrorised Nigeria. The previous president, Buhari, was elected in 2013 largely because he was seen as the figure that could save Nigeria from Boko Haram. Buhari was a former military general who actually seized power himself in a military coup in the 80s before being deposed by another coup a few years later.  He was considered a no-nonsense strongman that could act as a stabilising force in Nigeria, fix the issues with corruption and destroy the insurgency. However, he failed to win several elections because frankly he was a poor politician and Nigeria is the kind of place where the government is dictated by corrupt powerbrokers. \n\nTo secure power, Buhari had to make a deal with the current president Tinubu where Tinubu would guarantee the regions Buhari needed to win the elections and after Buhari's terms were done, Buhari status as a strong military leader would give Tinubu legitimacy if he supported him after. Tinubu is a more traditional \"power broker\" style politician that accumulated political capital through shady deals as opposed to Buhari's status coming from being a veteran. \n\nThis part is very relevant to the Niger situation - **Over the last 10 years however,  the struggle to deal with Boko Haram (as well as general rule of law in the country) exposed the state of the Nigerian military. It is ill-disciplined, poorly trained and poorly equipped because of the siphoning away of military funding by corrupt officers and officials.** Buhari's military spent more time cruising along highways and extorting civilians like a South American cartel. Buhari's approval rating also plummeted because of the inability to deal with Boko Haram or the corruption he pledged to fight.\n\nThe current president Tinubu inherited a very unpopular political party from Buhari, does not particularly connect with large sections of the voting population and has very strong allegations of corruption against him (allegations of drug trafficking and election fraud). I think he simply does not have the political capital for military intervention, especially if the Nigerian military might embarrass themselves against a motivated Niger supported by Wagner mercenaries. The Senate is generally representative of the mood of the Nigerian political class and the message seems to be that Tinubu has to deal with the bigger issues currently facing Nigeria. You also can't forget the ethnoreligious angle here - Niger has a very large Hausa and Fulani ethnic population just like Nigeria.",

        "body": "Fact sheet: Military coup in Niger.\n\nhttps://acleddata.com/2023/08/03/fact-sheet-military-coup-in-niger/\n\nKey Trends\n\n\u2022 Niger has experienced continuous growth in jihadist activity since 2018, with a record year for violence in 2021 measured by fatalities\n\n\u2022 While the number of political violence incidents increased further in 2022, the lethality of the violence has steadily declined, with a significant overall decrease in fatalities last year\n\n\u2022 In the first six months of 2023, political violence decreased by an estimated 39% when compared to the previous six-month period from July to December 2022\n\n\u2022 Attacks on civilians decreased by 49%, and resulting fatalities decreased by 16%\n\n\u2022 Operations by the Nigerien security forces increased by 32%, however, as part of a continuous effort to counter insecurity\n\n\u2022 Cases of looting and property destruction were the most common type of incident during this period, suggesting that militant groups like IS Sahel and JNIM increasingly see Niger as a key target for resource extraction\n\n\u2022 The western Tillaberi region is the most affected by conflict, although there has been a notable geographic shift from the north to the west\n\nOverview\n\nOn 26 July 2023, the Presidential Guard in Niger launched a coup and detained President Mohamed Bazoum and his family. Senior officers from various branches of the defense and security forces (FDS) formed a junta, named the National Council for the Safeguarding of the Homeland (CNSP), and announced the seizure of power on a televised broadcast.\u00a0Public response varied, with initial demonstrations in support of Bazoum being dispersed by mutinous soldiers, followed by subsequent demonstrations in support of the CNSP. By 27 July, the Nigerien Armed Forces joined the CNSP, citing their intent to avoid lethal confrontation and to safeguard the president and his family.\u00a0\n\nThe coup has largely been condemned internationally, including by key stakeholders like the United States,\u00a0France,\u00a0the European Union,\u00a0and ECOWAS. During a summit in Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, ECOWAS considered military intervention, and threatened sanctions to pressure the junta to reinstate Bazoum by giving a one-week ultimatum.\u00a0The West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) imposed immediate sanctions and froze Nigerien state assets.\u00a0Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali have declared their support for the Nigerien junta and expressed their refusal to apply any sanctions imposed on Niger. Burkina Faso and Mali further warned in a joint statement that any military intervention in Niger was a declaration of war against the two countries. The reactions in support of Niger from the junta-led states has set the stage for a deeper divide and potential break-up of the West African bloc.\u00a0\n\nThe coup\u2019s aftermath brings a high potential for domestic unrest and regional conflict, a surge in militant activities, democratic backsliding and restriction of civil liberties, and severe socio-economic consequences due to sanctions. Furthermore, the military junta has not consolidated its power grab and faces strong opposition by many international stakeholders. Bazoum not only enjoys support from the international community but also from a large segment of the population across Niger, with signs of supporters counter-mobilizing for mass demonstrations against the junta.\n\nUnderlying Discontent and Palace Politics\n\nNiger represents the last of the three central Sahel states to succumb to a military coup, after Mali in 2020 and 2021, and two coups in Burkina Faso in 2022. While some interpret this event through the context of Russia\u2019s increasing influence or its alignment with Western military training initiatives, the primary catalysts were essentially domestic in nature. The leader of the coup, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, was rumored to be on the verge of losing his position as head of the Presidential Guard\u00a0\u2013 a role in which he had defended the regime against numerous attempted coups during the tenures of both former President Mahamadou Issoufou and his successor Bazoum. It is possible that growing discontent within the FDS had intensified over the years under the rule of Issoufou and his successor Bazoum. This underlying dissatisfaction may have set the stage for the recent military coup, given the swift alignment of other senior military officers. Past coup attempts further underscore a fragile balance on which the regime had to perch and a threat that Bazoum may have underestimated. The decision by senior officers from various branches to join the junta does not necessarily mean unequivocal support for the coup. Instead, it may reflect a strategic move to manage the unfolding crisis, while seizing the opportunity to dismantle the entrenched political system established by the ruling party PNDS under the leadership of Issoufou and Bazoum.\n\nAmid growing anti-French sentiments in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, as well as within Niger, the country paradoxically found itself increasingly set apart in the central Sahel, representing France\u2019s last ally and counter-terrorism hub. While Bazoum\u2019s rhetoric was candid, it was often perceived as publicly antagonistic and patronizing towards his Sahelian counterparts, whether or not his points were valid. This particularly applies to his critiques of Mali\u2019s decision to partner with the Russian private military company\u00a0Wagner Group\u00a0and Burkina Faso\u2019s strategy to mobilize self-defense militias \u2013 policies that have seemingly exacerbated violence and security issues within the two neighboring countries. Moreover, as the supreme commander of Niger\u2019s armed forces, Bazoum\u2019s recent interview, in which he suggested that militants were \u201cstronger and more battle-hardened\u201d than the region\u2019s armies, was likely a misstep. This comment may have been seen as demoralizing, striking a nerve within the military and contributing to rising tensions in the lead-up to the coup.",

The decision by senior officers from various branches to join the junta does not necessarily mean unequivocal support for the coup. Instead, it may reflect a strategic move to manage the unfolding crisis, while seizing the opportunity to dismantle the entrenched political system established by the ruling party PNDS under the leadership of Issoufou and Bazoum.</p>\n\n<p>Amid growing anti-French sentiments in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, as well as within Niger, the country paradoxically found itself increasingly set apart in the central Sahel, representing France\u2019s last ally and counter-terrorism hub. While Bazoum\u2019s rhetoric was candid, it was often perceived as publicly antagonistic and patronizing towards his Sahelian counterparts, whether or not his points were valid. This particularly applies to his critiques of Mali\u2019s decision to partner with the Russian private military company\u00a0Wagner Group\u00a0and Burkina Faso\u2019s strategy to mobilize self-defense militias \u2013 policies that have seemingly exacerbated violence and security issues within the two neighboring countries. Moreover, as the supreme commander of Niger\u2019s armed forces, Bazoum\u2019s recent interview, in which he suggested that militants were \u201cstronger and more battle-hardened\u201d than the region\u2019s armies, was likely a misstep. This comment may have been seen as demoralizing, striking a nerve within the military and contributing to rising tensions in the lead-up to the coup.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Violence and Conflict Trends\n\nNiger confronts an array of security challenges: in the west, it faces the Sahelian insurgency driven by IS Sahel and the al-Qaeda-affiliated JNIM, while the southeastern Diffa region is affected by the ISWAP and Boko Haram insurgency. The central Tahoua region is seeing a mixture of IS Sahel militancy and banditry. In Maradi, along the southern border with Nigeria, organized bandit gangs are also highly active. The Agadez region, rich in gold and smuggling routes that stretch along the border with Libya, Algeria, and Chad, has additionally attracted a plethora of armed groups, among them Chadian and Sudanese rebels, drug traffickers, and organized criminal gangs, all contributing to widespread rural banditry (see map below).\u00a0\n\nThe Tillaberi region remains most affected by conflict, although there is a notable geographic shift from the northern to the western parts of the region. This shift in violent activity may be attributed to several converging factors. Notably, IS Sahel, the most active armed actor in both the country and the Tillaberi region, refocused its efforts on the Malian side of the border in early 2022. This strategic redirection coincided with France\u2019s withdrawal of forces from Mali and the subsequent reconfiguration of its mission to Niger, where operations were primarily concentrated in northern Tillaberi. IS Sahel and JNIM also engage in simultaneous campaigns in neighboring Burkina Faso, with the border areas in western Tillaberi being used as staging ground. Furthermore, Nigerien authorities have been making concerted efforts to resolve long-standing intercommunal conflicts in Ouallam and Banibangou, the departments previously most affected by violence. The combination of these factors likely contributed to the observed shift in armed engagements.\n\nDespite these challenges, Niger has statistically fared better than its neighbors in terms of violence and conflict. The military junta cited the \u201ccontinually deteriorating security situation\u201d as a core justification for the coup. The years of 2019 and 2020, during Issoufou\u2019s reign, were particularly devastating for the Nigerien FDS as they suffered heavy losses due to a series of mass-casualty attacks perpetrated by IS Sahel. In 2021, Niger experienced a record year of conflict coinciding with its first democratic transition when Bazoum succeeded Issoufou. Ever since, Niger continues to see high numbers of conflict incidents, although levels of lethal violence are in steady decline, and significantly reduced in comparison to Mali and Burkina Faso (see graph below).\n\n \n\nOutlook\n\nAs the dust from the coup begins to settle, Niger stands at a crossroads. The success of the junta in maintaining power and building legitimacy are not guaranteed, with significant opposition domestically and internationally. The junta is yet to consolidate its position and the situation is far from stabilized. Persistent support for Bazoum brings the potential for continued unrest, mass demonstrations against the junta, and violent contestation among pro-junta and pro-regime camps, adding additional layers of uncertainty. The potential fallout of this instability may affect the entire Sahel region, exacerbating existing security challenges and possibly giving rise to new threats both domestically and regionally due to the ramifications of the current crisis. Ongoing insurgencies and armed groups like JNIM, IS Sahel, ISWAP, and Boko Haram (JAS) may exploit and profit from such instability and discord, leading to escalating levels of violence.\u00a0\n\nThe consolidation of power by the Nigerien junta would represent the further spread of democratic backsliding in the Sahel. Should this occur, all central Sahelian states would be effectively ruled by military juntas, marking the end of democracy in the subregion for the time being. Niger will likely face similar consequences as have already been observed in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, where the ascension of military governments led to the erosion of civil liberties and fundamental rights, including freedom of press and expression. Furthermore, all three countries have so far failed to suppress a growing regional insurgency expanding across West Africa. Niger is also at risk of severe socio-economic repercussions due to anticipated sanctions and suspension of development and budgetary aid. These pressures are likely to further strain Niger\u2019s already fragile economy.",

I have no idea; but I think it's safe to bet it's significantly disproportionate.\n\nI'm not even sure to what extent Russia is able to project power to Niger. (or I guess against Nigeria in this hypothetical. ..Which conflict would assumedly still be on Niger soil. And that questions to what extent Nigeria is able to project power? I don't know if more developed sub-saharan countries are capable of having \"wars\" beyond pickup truck machine guns and maybe some helicopters/artillery, and short-range armored land transports). All I know about their aerial refueling capabilities is that they're said to be limited.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_military_bases_abroad\n\nLooks like Nigeria has just been [fighting \"terrorists\"] including Al Qaeda/ISIL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Nigeria), and (groups, tribes?, groups of military) since the 1970's/80's   where they had some conflict with Chad & Libya.\n\nLooks like it's roughly 2,300 miles from Syria across the Med/Libya. I don't know how Libya would feel about that, or if they'd notice, but the alternate I assume is Suez Canal/Red Sea, and that's @ 3,300 miles.\n\nI'd guess they could fly helicopters off naval ships. But Niamey is about 500 miles from the coast. Or transport helicopters in cargo planes to a base in Niger. Or station a pair of fighters at some random airport/base in the general area. But if there's a base, defense may require resources. Wikipedia says a Su 34 has about 2500 mile range when fully loaded. I guess they could use a single bomber.

I have no idea; but I think it&#39;s safe to bet it&#39;s significantly disproportionate.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not even sure to what extent Russia is able to project power to Niger. (or I guess against Nigeria in this hypothetical. ..Which conflict would assumedly still be on Niger soil. And that questions to what extent Nigeria is able to project power? I don&#39;t know if more developed sub-saharan countries are capable of having &quot;wars&quot; beyond pickup truck machine guns and maybe some helicopters/artillery, and short-range armored land transports). All I know about their aerial refueling capabilities is that they&#39;re said to be limited.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_military_bases_abroad\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_military_bases_abroad</a></p>\n\n<p>Looks like Nigeria has just been [fighting &quot;terrorists&quot;] including Al Qaeda/ISIL (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Nigeria\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Nigeria</a>), and (groups, tribes?, groups of military) since the 1970&#39;s/80&#39;s   where they had some conflict with Chad &amp; Libya.</p>\n\n<p>Looks like it&#39;s roughly 2,300 miles from Syria across the Med/Libya. I don&#39;t know how Libya would feel about that, or if they&#39;d notice, but the alternate I assume is Suez Canal/Red Sea, and that&#39;s @ 3,300 miles.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d guess they could fly helicopters off naval ships. But Niamey is about 500 miles from the coast. Or transport helicopters in cargo planes to a base in Niger. Or station a pair of fighters at some random airport/base in the general area.

Do you not see how ridiculously speculative and dramatic this is?

It is possible that growing discontent within the FDS had intensified over the years under the rule of Issoufou and his successor Bazoum. This underlying dissatisfaction may have set the stage for the recent military coup, given the swift alignment of other senior military officers. Past coup attempts further underscore a fragile balance on which the regime had to perch and a threat that Bazoum may have underestimated. The decision by senior officers from various branches to join the junta does not necessarily mean unequivocal support for the coup.

                "body": "Here's a good report by CNA about PPP vs Exchange rate when comparing military expenditure.\n\nhttps://www.cna.org/reports/2019/10/russian-military-expenditure\n\n> This volatility in the USD military expenditure series resulted in Russia rising from seventh\nplace in the world by military expenditure in 2005 to third place in 2013, the year before the\nsharp depreciation of the ruble vis-\u00e0-vis the USD (Figure 4). As the ruble depreciated after the\ncollapse in the price of oil in 2014, the USD value of Russian military expenditure declined with\nit. As a result, Russia slipped to sixth place. Figures 3 and 4 very clearly illustrate the problems\nassociated with using USD at market exchange rates to measure military expenditure across\ncountries and across time. However, exchange rate volatility is not the only or even the most\nimportant problem when using market exchange rate-based measures of military expenditure.\nMore important is the fact that many goods and services have different relative prices within a\ncountry, with non-traded goods and services being relatively less expensive in poorer\ncountries. This relativity can be very important when calculating relative military expenditure.\nIf the price of goods and services procured by the Russian government for military uses (for instance, the wages of military personnel or workers in the defense-industrial complex, or the price of military equipment) is lower than analogous US goods and services, the market\nexchange rate-based measure of military expenditure will understate the size of the basket of\nmilitary goods and services obtained by the Russian government in any given year.\n\n>As a result of these problems, the preferred method for inferring real relative economic output\nacross countries is therefore to use a purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate. The PPP\nmethod of conversion is not always easily grasped by non-economists. To explain PPP, the\nEconomist magazine\u2019s widely known \u201cBig Mac\u201d index is often used to illustrate how costs vary\nacross the world, even for purchasing near-identical products. The relative cost of a hamburger\nillustrates the problem. If a Big Mac is sold for 120 RUB in Moscow and 5 USD in Washington, DC, this would suggest a PPP exchange rate of 24 RUB to 1 USD. After all, identical products are\nbeing sold in both Moscow and Washington.\nIn practice, the market exchange rate often differs considerably from the rate suggested by a\nPPP calculation. In September 2019, the RUB-to-USD exchange rate was around 65 RUB to 1\nUSD. The reason for this variation is usually to do with the differences in costs of inputs\nrequired to make the Big Mac: in Russia, input costs (e.g., labor, land, equipment) are lower\ncompared with those in the US, meaning that the ruble can on average buy more goods and\nservices in Russia than might be expected if using the prevailing market exchange rate.\nAnalysts use PPP \u201cweights\u201d to estimate the value of economic activity in a country that accounts\nfor differences in relative costs. Today the IMF calculates an implied PPP exchange rate of 23.4\nRUB to 1 USD. This happens to be nearly identical to the calculation based on the Big Mac index\noutlined above. Given that the actual market exchange rate is 65 RUB to 1 USD, this would\nsuggest that the value of economic activity in Russia is over 2.5 times larger than the value\nimplied by the prevailing market exchange rate.\nIn general, market exchange rates are the appropriate choice to measure financial flows across\nborders. For example, the current account or trade balance represents flows of financial\nresources across countries. It is appropriate to use the market exchange rate to convert these\nflows into dollars when aggregating across regions or calculating the global current account\ndiscrepancy. But for other variables, it is often more appropriate to use PPP-based exchange\nrates. For example, although market exchange rates are appropriate for measuring the value\nof internationally traded goods, non-traded goods and services tend to be cheaper in lower\nincome countries, especially large, populous countries such as Russia. For example, the price\nof an Uber ride of the same distance is significantly higher in London than in Moscow. The same\nis true of the relative price of a haircut. This is because wages tend to be lower in relatively\npoorer countries, and services such as Uber and hairdressers are relatively labor intensive. Any\nanalysis that fails to take these differences into account will underestimate the purchasing\npower of consumers in lower income countries.\nEmploying PPP exchange rates yields significantly different estimates of the size of low- and\nmiddle-income economies. For Russia, the difference in estimated GDP is substantial.\nAccording to IMF data, the Russian GDP was $1.6 trillion in 2018, accounting for just 1.8\npercent of global GDP. This would make Russia the 11th largest economy in the world when\nusing market exchange rates, slightly smaller than Italy and Canada and only slightly larger\nthan South Korea and Australia. Russia\u2019s per capita income according to this measure was\naround $11,000, which amounts to around 15 percent of per capita income in the US and just\nover 30 percent of the European Union (EU) average. Put into wider perspective, this would be\nlower than Poland and Chile, but higher than Brazil and Turkey. \n\n>To be sure, the use of PPP exchange rates to measure military expenditure is not without\nlimitations. PPP exchange rates are not necessarily appropriate for comparing military output\nbecause they reflect the relative price of an average bundle of all goods and services produced\nin an economy (usually GDP) and they are not limited to military services. The cost of military\ngoods and services could be higher or lower than the economy-wide average of goods and\nservices. The rate of inflation for military goods and services might also differ from the\neconomy-wide average, which might lead to further calculation errors.\nAnother weakness in using PPP exchange rates is that a substantial share of military equipment\nis imported or incorporates components that are manufactured from materials and inputs sold\nat world market prices, such as electronics, diesel engines, or aircraft frames. This will affect\nsome countries more than others, especially countries such as India that rely on a relatively\nhigh share of imported components and equipment from countries with higher costs. By\ncontrast, this is less likely to affect countries with well-developed domestic defense industries,\nsuch as the United States and Russia.",

I guess Russia could sell itself on less liberalism (that&#39;s funny to write after 80 years).</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it&#39;s more like, take any land you can, but make long term financial contracts for Russia&#39;s financial benefit &amp; get out? Or take things that the average person won&#39;t miss, like maritime rights, or arms limitations, or space-related stuff? Make, then keep, Europe weak enough that it is in a poor negotiating position for decades to come, and at Russia&#39;s mercy?</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if Russia cares about unbalancing whatever exists between Ru/US/EU/China/India/Japan/ME.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, doesn&#39;t seem to get past the nuke issue.</p>\n</div>",
