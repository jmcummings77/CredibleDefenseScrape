      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

One, however, said the aid effort was a Japanese initiative and not anything the United States had pressed for.\n\n>**LOOSENING THE RULES**\n\n>The scope of Japanese military aid is limited by a self-imposed ban on lethal equipment exports.\n\n>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in December promised to review that restriction when he unveiled an unprecedented five-year military build-up that will double defence spending within five years.\n\n>Looser export rules are expected in coming months, but as pressure grows on industrial economies to help Ukraine, Tokyo has begun testing those restrictions.\n\n>After Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited Japan last month for the Group of Seven leaders' summit, Kishida donated military trucks and other vehicles. Tokyo has also told the United States it can buy industrial explosives in Japan for artillery shells destined for Ukraine, and may provide shells themselves to the United States, freeing up supplies for Kyiv.\n\n>Japan's military aid to the Philippines \"will expand step by step and my hope is that it will change to include lethal weapons\" such as anti-ship missiles, said Kawano, who served as chief of the Japanese Self-Defence Forces' (SDF) Joint Staff for five years until 2019.\n\n>Kawano and the government officials who spoke to Reuters predicted Manila could give Japan access to its military bases, as it does with the United States, allowing Japanese SDF aircraft to patrol the South China Sea. Japan can monitor waters east of Taiwan from Yonaguni island, about 100 kilometres away.\n\n>In February the Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Kishida agreed in Tokyo that their militaries would cooperate in disaster relief.\n\n>That meeting, in which Kishida also promised Marcos 600 billion yen ($4.3 billion) in development aid and private investment, was preceded in December by the first-ever visit to the Philippines by Japanese fighter jets and a series of high-level military meetings. Japan in March observed U.S.-Philippine military drills, and this month their coast guards trained together for the first time.\n\n>All of this, experts say, could be a precursor to a reciprocal access agreement (RAA) that would allow both countries to deploy their forces on each other's soil. If Manila accepts such an agreement - Tokyo has RAAs with Britain and Australia - a pact could be concluded within a year, another of the three Japanese government officials said.\n\n>\"Since the change in administration, the Philippines has been giving very positive signals, and that could mean a quick agreement,\" said Yusuke Ishihara, a senior fellow at Japan's National Institute for Defense Studies.

If anything, China being harder on Russia would gain it huge favor with the west.\n\nThe close relation with Russia was Xi's pet project. It was an *extremely* tough sell early on in his first mandate. It went against the tradition of the CCP, and it also caused a lot of concern among younger party members, who feared it would jeopardise the highly beneficial economic ties with US. It was one of those few ideas that both hard-liners and liberals hated with a passion. China being harder on Russia would gain it huge favour with the West but it would still be a very dangerous thing for Xi to do at this point; even with his latest reforms, and his long tenure, unheard of since the days of Mao, China is still not quite an autocracy.

It was one of those few ideas that both hard-liners and liberals hated with a passion.

This type of episode happens roughly every 6 months so if you&#39;re at all interested in NK capabilities, give it a listen.</p>\n\n<p>Every few weeks, someone in this thread asks for podcast recommendations. CSIS has <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/podcasts\">many</a> that cover a wide range of topics so be sure to check them out!

Businesses remember things like that\n\nRussia is an economic powderkeg like we've never seen. I know this is a warfare themed sub primarily, but the economics here are powerful and hiding under the waves.

It also designates the Bundeswehr \u2014 the German armed forces \u2014 as the \u201ccornerstone of Europe\u2019s conventional defence\u201d.\n\n>Russia poses \u201cthe greatest threat to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area\u201d, the plan says, underscoring the profound changes in the security landscape for Europe\u2019s largest economy since President Vladimir Putin unleashed his full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.\n\n>It describes China, Germany\u2019s biggest trading partner, as acting increasingly as a competitor and rival to Berlin and posing a growing threat to international security in recent years. But it adds that, without Beijing, \u201cmany global challenges and crises cannot be solved\u201d.\n\n>Publication of the\u00a0strategy was repeatedly delayed over disagreements in chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition over key passages in the text. Two parties, the liberal FDP and the Greens, had initially advocated the creation of a national security council akin to those in the US, France and UK \u2014 but that idea was ultimately rejected.\n\n>The strategy comes nearly 16 months after Scholz told the Bundestag that Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine marked a Zeitenwende or inflection point in Germany\u2019s post-war history, necessitating a reorientation of defence and security policy. Berlin would end its energy dependence on Russia, he said, and spend much more on its military, creating a \u20ac100bn investment fund for the Bundeswehr.\n\n>The idea of \u201cintegrated security\u201d underpinned the plan, Scholz told reporters on Wednesday, which he described as \u201cmeshing together all means and instruments to strengthen Germany\u2019s security against external threats\u201d.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about defence and the Bundeswehr but the whole spectrum of our security,\u201d he said, saying the document covers \u201cdiplomacy just as much as the police and fire service, disaster relief, international development, cyber security and the resilience of our supply chains\u201d.\n\n>Annalena Baerbock, the Green foreign minister, said security in the 21st century was not just about armies and diplomacy but ensuring that \u201cI can buy essential medicines in the chemist, that I\u2019m not spied on by China when chatting with friends or manipulated by Russian bots while scrolling on social media\u201d.\n\n>Julia Friedlander, a former member of the US National Security Council, said publication of the strategy marked a big change in how Germany described \u201cits role in the world\u201d.\n\n>\u201cJust to be able to say: \u2018these are Germany\u2019s interests\u2019 is a huge step in the right direction,\u201d said Friedlander, who now heads the Berlin office of Atlantic Bridge, which promotes closer ties between Germany and the US.\n\n>The 76-page security strategy is based on three pillars: improving Germany\u2019s ability to defend itself; strengthening resilience \u2014 in part by reducing its dependence on certain countries for raw materials and energy, diversifying supply chains and bolstering cyber-defences; and the importance of sustainability.\n\n>Asked how soon Germany could fulfil its pledge to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence, Christian Lindner, finance minister and FDP leader, said the \u201cpolitical intention\u201d was to do so next year. The goal would in part be achieved by using funds from the \u20ac100bn Bundeswehr fund, he added. Germany spent 1.49 per cent of GDP on defence last year, according to provisional Nato figures.\n\n>Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, said that the strategy and its stated aims were \u201cvery positive\u201d but noted that Lindner had insisted it must be implemented without spending additional funds.\n\n>He said: \u201cIt says all the right things but it doesn\u2019t come with a political commitment to also mobilise the resources for this that are necessary.\u201d",

They're often lumped together but NATO is a military alliance. It has a fairly sttraightforward, self-containde charter that lays out a lot of basics, but also leaves a lot of room for interpretation, to the point where NATO is what the allies says it is and does what they say it does.\n\nAnd it also has all the leverage in the world with Hungary: Hungary's defence strategy hinges on NATO membership, at least for now. Hungary is a small country, with modest funding capabilities, a small population, practically no defence industry, and a history of alienating all its neighbours. It could afford some belicose rhetoric in the relative peace of the '00s and early '10s but if wars in Europe become a thing again, Hungary is one of the countries that can't afford *not* to choose sides, the best it can do is choose the stronger side.\n\nThe EU is a very different beast: it's not just a military alliance, it's a body of political governance; it has extensive legislation, designed to ensure equal rights and the development of mutual interests and national economies, not just mutual defence; and a significant amount of political power is entrusted to officials elected or nominated specifically for EU positions, rather than being exercised by delegates of national governments. So dealing with \"mavericks\" like Orban (I'm deliberately trying to use a more neutral word here...) is a lot harder than it is for NATO, a fact further compounded by the fact that the EU is inexplicably trying to pick a fight with both Poland and Hungary at the same time (which is... probably just testament to the fact that many EU officials are not exactly the brightest crop of national politics).\n\nThere's also just far less 5D economics chess that Hungary can play within NATO vs. EU. The Hungarian Defence Forces are a modest customer of the international defence industry, but Hungary is a major transit country for EU goods. Dropping from NATO would complicate regional strategy to some degree, but it would be manageable, and would deprive Hungary of the one reliable international defence supplier it has access to. A \"Huxit\" would be a lot tougher to manage for the EU -- Hungary's economy would probably be in shambles without it (which is probably one reason why Orban has been all talk and no action when it came to EU membership) but the risk to EU economy would also be significant, which is why it probably makes more sense to just wait for Orban to go away than sour things with Hungary forever.

I feel like it might be the case for some countries/populations (and the people who are really involved in this conflict on internet), but I have a feeling many more just see it as Ukraine fighting to defend itself and the West helping them do so. Are there any polls on how it is perceived, beyond questions on whether Ukraine should be supported or not?\n\nAs for examples, I think one would maybe have to look back at old European wars which were fought for control over territories deemed necessary to one's status/influence? Regarding Russia's history, maybe the Russo-Circassian war presents some parallels. Russia started losing influence to the Ottoman Empire in a region which it increasingly saw as its own, wanted to make it a buffer zone with the Turks, saw it as crucial for control over the Black Sea Coast, etc. Circassians fought for their independence, received Turkish and British military aid and support. British support followed a Circassian delegation which came to the UK to talk about their plight (it was a genocidal war), eliciting strong support among the British (and particularly Scottish) population (with even the possibility of direct military action to create a protectorate being discussed at Parliament), the UK did less than what many British citizens were asking (just providing military training, weapons, humanitarian help) but probably wouldn't have done anything if it didn't also have geopolitical interests to do so.\n\nAnother commenter mentions the Suez crisis which is probably a much better example in the sense that it shows declining Empires giving a last go at preserving their global status. Neither case come too close though; the Russian Empire didn't have a nuclear bomb, and I feel like the Suez crisis would be a more relevant parallel if China was ready to play the role the US did at the time vis-\u00e0-vis its allies. There's also an emotional aspect to the question for Russia (or at least Putin) which might be more important than the purely \"interest\" aspect, although it feeds it.

But when you unpack it from Twitter I think this war just surfaced trends that have existed for 30 years  that non western powers are getting western standard in terms of night vision, satellites etc.</p>\n</div>",

On the ISW Map, Russian-controlled territory is shaded red. Therefore, for this market to resolve to \"Yes\", there must be territory that includes at least some coastline between Henichesk and the Russian border near Taganrog, which is not colored red on the ISW map.\n\n>For the purposes of this market, if the small strip of land to the south of \"Molochnoye Ozera\", south of Melitopol, is still red, it would classify as Russia continuing to have a land bridge from Russia, even if Ukraine destroys the bridge which physically connects that territory.\n\n>The resolution source for this market will be the ISW's \"Interactive Map: Russia's Invasion of Ukraine\" (e.g.https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375). If the ISW's \"Interactive Map\" is rendered permanently unavailable, other information from the ISW may be used. If information from the ISW is rendered permanently unavailable, information from Liveuamap (https://liveuamap.com/) may be used.

Ukraine will likely be able to make further incremental gains, but Russia has had ample time to entrench so I don't find the likelihood of a crushing Ukrainian victory particularly likely.
