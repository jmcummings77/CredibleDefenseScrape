Facing the risk of a revenue shortfall, the government may opt for fiscal consolidation by letting inflation erode some the real value of the social benefits.\u201d\n\n> In the second half of last year, Russia spent just over 1 trillion rubles ($15 billion) to assist families with children and about 400 billion rubles more on pensions, amounts that Siluanov said he expects to double in 2023.\n\n>Still, Russia\u2019s fiscal position remains relatively strong even with the widening deficit, but if the price cap imposed by the US and its allies on Russian crude this year proves effective, pressure on the budget is likely to grow.\n\n>Bloomberg Economics additionally estimates that outlays for people in the military, including volunteers and those who were mobilized, may total around 1.1 trillion rubles per year. \n\n> The relief hardly compensates for the overall impoverishment Russia has suffered in the nearly a year since the invasion. Over a third of the population started to economize more on food, according to a state-run pollster, with real disposable incomes falling for three straight quarters.\n\n>\u201cThe people as a whole are getting poorer, but the poor are becoming fewer in number,\u201d said Evgeny Gontmakher, an economist and former government official. \n\n>Spillovers from the war hollowed out the middle class so much that it now comprises no more than 10% of the population, according to Gontmakher. Hundreds of thousands who had the means to leave Russia ended up fleeing in two waves, frequently leaving behind property and jobs. \n\n> Besides ensuring loyalty from the most disadvantaged Russians, long the core of Putin\u2019s electorate, the government is creating incentives for people to join the military at a time when it\u2019s having to appeal to convicts and use mercenaries to make up for its severe manpower shortages in Ukraine.\n\n> In late December, Putin ordered the payment of 5 million rubles to the families of soldiers killed in Ukraine, enough to buy an apartment in many parts of Russia. Veterans who suffered an injury or trauma will get 3 million rubles.\n\n>Russia\u2019s propaganda machine is also churning out advertisements that circulate on social media and recruiting portals, touting contracts in the military as a get-rich scheme. \n\n>The poorest are seizing on the war as a quick escape from hardship and loans they can\u2019t repay, according to Zubarevich. \n\n>>\u201cPeople often go to war because of poverty,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to break free.\u201d\n\nAdd to this, that the estimate of direct military spending on the war costing around $1 billion/day should be considerable higher now given mobilization, there\u2019s no way they don\u2019t fudge eco numbers in a big way going forward.",

It's an open question, Russia could definitely not support an army of 25 million people (Basically the entire able-bodied male population of Russia) without the economy completely collapsing. 5 million people would even be a significant stretch and would probably be beyond the existing Russian state's capabilities. 500k troops is definitely realistic for Russia to supply, but it would probably take a year or two to adequately equip, but there are a lot of factors that could influence that timeline. If there was a ceasefire or disengagement in Ukraine, Russia could probably build up a reserve of 500k more quickly, but while there is active combat at the front they have to juggle supplying the forces fighting in Ukraine already with ammo, replacement vehicles etc., which will make it more difficult for Russia to equip a mobilized force.\n4. This is obviously a question being asked a lot these days.

Another open question, how long Russia can last in the war is dependent largely on political and economic factors. Putin seems to be basically trying to transform Russia into a barracks state, in which the major focus of the state just becomes military spending at the expense of developing the civilian economy, which is probably unsustainable long term.

One month ago (December 15), it was [8463 for Russia](http://web.archive.org/web/20221215112043/https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html) and [2604 for Ukraine](http://web.archive.org/web/20221215094056/https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html).\n\nThat means 228 for Russia and 169 for Ukraine in about a month, which is ~1.35:1. The ratio has been much closer to 2:1 than 3:1 since mid November, often below that.\n\nOf course the total is only dropping slowly because there are 8 months of backlog, but it's already noticeable - it was 3.56 in mid-November and 3.14 now (part of it due to a large backlog of AFU losses, followed by a large albeit smaller backlog of RU losses, but it doesn't fully explain the drop).\n\nEdit: a small caveat in that Oryx appears to have deleted 53 Russian entries today, probably due to being double counted. I don't know how many of those had been added this past month, but assuming none had, it would mean  a 1.66:1 ratio for the last 30 days, which would still be well below the average observed for the entire war so far.",

Don\u2019t have confirmation regarding this specific incident.\n\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 About the strike on the oil refinery in Merefa in the Kharkiv region\n\nYesterday, Russian troops attacked a target at an oil refinery in Merefa, southwest of Kharkiv, using an S-300 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nAs a result of a missile hit, one of the refinery complexes was destroyed along with fuel. According to Ukrainian media, the work of the enterprise was suspended, one person died, one was injured.\n\n\ud83d\udd3bDespite the exact hit, the effectiveness of defeating the refinery is questionable. According to our data, there was practically no fuel in storage facilities in Merefa. One local guard of the State Emergency Service was enough to extinguish the fire.\n\nSince the summer, after several strikes on important oil facilities, the Ukrainian side has avoided storing fuel and lubricants at one point. After delivery to the refinery, all fuel is unloaded onto fuel trucks, tanks and transported to gas stations.\n\nThe public demonstration of \"serious\" destruction is intended to mislead the Russian leadership.

So while it may be we are only sending 12, its far more likely we will end up sending 60-100. Its either 12 a month is the pace we can pull them out of storage and get all the gaskets and seals back up to spec or it may be political in that we are not wanting to make an announcement that will have other repercussions in Moscow, Berlin or where ever. I know there was a plan to send 60 to Poland back in April </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forces.net/ukraine/uk-looking-sending-challenger-2-tanks-poland-part-move-support-ukraine\">https://www.forces.net/ukraine/uk-looking-sending-challenger-2-tanks-poland-part-move-support-ukraine</a></p>\n\n<p>But the US sent Abrams as Poland already had them.</p>\n</div>",
