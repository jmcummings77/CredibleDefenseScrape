By getting similar interchangeable platforms, Newzealand could gain greater effective protection for lower cost.</p>\n\n<p>for eg, if NewZealand made the decision to acquire 3-4 of the ships that AUs is getting for Tier 2 capability as their new frigate replacments, they would get a modern and robust navy with lower acquisition costs due to synergy anf economies of scale. 3-4 new frigates with 24-32 VLS + 16NSM(the current Tier 2 competitors all seem to show something around this config) would give Newzealand a formidable naval capability paired with their P-8 fleet(which imo is 2 aircraft short).</p>\n</div>",

A Russian milblogger claimed on December 10 that Russian Directorate of Military Representations officials attempted to seize all Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant (UAZ) off-road vehicles from an unspecified Russian naval infantry unit, but that the unit\u2019s officers convinced the officials to allow the unit to keep the vehicles.[76] The milblogger claimed that Russian volunteer efforts and soldiers purchase 99 percent of all SUVs and minibuses that Russian forces use in combat areas.[77] Another Russian milblogger claimed that Russian personnel personally fund their vehicle repairs and do not know how to obtain permission from the Russian military to continue to use personal vehicles.[78] Russian milbloggers previously noted that a Russian military ban on the use of civilian vehicles could impede Russian military movement, supplies and ammunition deliveries, and casualty evacuations, and therefore, ultimately demoralize military personnel.[79]\n\n> The Ukrainian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office confirmed on December 9 that the Iranian state aircraft manufacturer Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company produces Shahed-131/136 drones.[80] Ukrainian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office stated that it has yet to conclude investigations into the production of Mohajer-6 and Italmas drones (also known as Izdeliye drones) and noted that it sent requests to nine unspecified countries for legal assistance in investigating the supply of dual-use drone components to Iran and Russia.[81]\n\n**Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are using drones to remotely mine areas along the frontline.[82] The milblogger claimed that Russian drones can carry both OZM, PMN, and POM anti-personnel mines and PTM-3 and PTM-4 anti-tank mines.[83]\n\n> A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are upgrading their digital communications kits in T-72B3, T-80BVM, and T-90M tanks.[84] Russian news outlet Anna News reported that Sotniki-BL digital communications system first entered service with the 4th Motorized Rifle Battalion (2nd Luhansk People\u2019s Republic Army Corps) in August 2023, replacing outdated R-173 and R-123 radio communication systems.[85]\n\n**Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\n\n> Russian authorities continue long-term efforts to indoctrinate Ukrainian students in occupied Ukraine by directing funding to educational institutions in occupied Ukraine. The Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR) Militia announced on December 10 that Russian Deputy Minister of Science and Higher Education Ayrat Gatiyatov announced that the Russian government plans to allocate at least five billion rubles (about $54.2 million) to repair infrastructure at institutes of higher education in occupied Luhansk Oblast from 2024 to 2027.[86] Gatiyatov also stated that the Russian government has allocated over 5.5 billion rubles (about $59.6 million) to universities in occupied Luhansk Oblast since the beginning of 2023.[87] Russian occupation authorities will likely use these renovations to increase enrollment into Russian-government controlled educational institutions.\n\n**Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\n\n> Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made a historical appeal to past Russian and Soviet military victories during a speech to the Doha Forum on December 10 in an effort to downplay Russian losses in Ukraine and Russia\u2019s degraded military capabilities.[88] Lavrov claimed that the military action \u201cunleashed by the US at the hands of Ukraine\u201d has only made Russia stronger and claimed that this phenomenon is similar to alleged increased Russian strength following military victories over Napoleon in the 19th century and Hitler during the Second World War.[89] Lavrov likely invoked these false historical analogies to minimize Russia\u2019s losses in Ukraine and to assert that Russia would still be able to defeat the West in a hypothetical confrontation as the Russian empire and the Soviet Union did fighting European powers in past costly wars. Lavrov likely also referenced these false historical analogies, which were followed by periods of increased Russian and Soviet geopolitical power, to claim that the war in Ukraine will conclude with a geopolitically empowered Russia that can more widely challenge the West. The analogies are farcical because the current war began with an unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, whereas Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 and Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.\n\n> The Ukrainian Center for Combating Disinformation reported on December 10 that Russian actors sent false SMS messages to Ukrainian residents in Zaporizhzhia City alleging a planned mass evacuation from the city in December 2023.[90] Russian sources are increasingly promoting information operations aimed at generating Ukrainian social discontent, and Russian actors may want to promote alleged military threats to near rear population centers, even those far outside the realistic potential for Russian advance, in an effort to promote discontent towards Ukrainian leadership.[91]\n\n**Significant activity in Belarus (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)**\n\n> Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko met with Equatorial Guinean President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo on December 9 and 10 and stated that Belarus will open an embassy in Malabo in the near future and that Equatorial Guinea will open an embassy in Minsk by the end of 2024.[92]",

The analogies are farcical because the current war began with an unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, whereas Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 and Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian Center for Combating Disinformation reported on December 10 that Russian actors sent false SMS messages to Ukrainian residents in Zaporizhzhia City alleging a planned mass evacuation from the city in December 2023.[90] Russian sources are increasingly promoting information operations aimed at generating Ukrainian social discontent, and Russian actors may want to promote alleged military threats to near rear population centers, even those far outside the realistic potential for Russian advance, in an effort to promote discontent towards Ukrainian leadership.[91]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Significant activity in Belarus (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko met with Equatorial Guinean President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo on December 9 and 10 and stated that Belarus will open an embassy in Malabo in the near future and that Equatorial Guinea will open an embassy in Minsk by the end of 2024.[92]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Of course I could be wrong, but I follow this closely so I think to have some insight about the issue.\n\n88th Mechanized Brigade. In the spring it had received Panthera T6 and HMMWV IMVs and RBS 70 MANPADS. Then there was no more news about it, except (false) rumors that it was near Kupyansk. Last week, after a media silence of months and months, the brigade's Telegram channel (I think it may be the official one, the link to the channel is on the brigade's Facebook page) posted an interview with a handful of POWs from the Russian 70th Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Division (thus, Robotyne/Novoprokopivka area), putting the 88th Brigade's logo at the beginning and writing they had been captured by units of the brigade. I am waiting for further confirmation. Since late October the (new) 33rd and 23rd Mech Brigades, which had been inactive since early summer, were brought into action in the same area, so it could mean a major rotation happened in the sector (considering the 47th and likely the 116th were pulled out).\n\n13th Jager Brigade. In May units of this brigade were training in Norway. In the summer it was rumored that it had been deployed along the Russian-Ukrainian state border (I mean in Kharkiv, Sumy or Chernihiv oblasts), but this has not been confirmed. Brigade's social channels have been inactive for months.\n\n5th Tank Brigade. It has a very troubled history. It was announced several times that it was being formed but then nothing more was heard. In July it should have been activated for real; it's not clear yet which tanks it's going to receive. Last week, photos were published showing soldiers from the rifle battalion of this brigade in training.\n\n\"Khartiia\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard. Last brigade of the OG that has not been deployed yet. Last month it received T-72s and BTR-3s.\n\nIn June, the Ground Forces created four brigades (one for each operational command), which were called \"reserve rifle\", and then changed their names to \"infantry\" brigades - a new type of brigade. They are the 141st, 142nd, 143rd and 144th. In early summer the 142nd Infantry Brigade had posted a video showing shelling of Russian positions in the Avdiivka sector, but absolutely nothing has been heard from it ever since. On the 142nd Brigade's Facebook page a few weeks ago they posted a video of brigade's personnel in training, and they probably received Kozak IMVs and perhaps BMP-1s. On the 143rd I have no information, it doesn't even have a Facebook page. The Russians had reported the 143rd being in the northern flank of Bakhmut some time ago but there was no confirmation to this at all. The 141st in late October had posted on Facebook that it was looking for contract soldiers, and offering good equipment and training abroad to them. I have seen fundraising initiatives and posts for the 144th and a post in September gave it \"in the direction of Kherson\", but I have no evidence to confirm this. In general, I believe these brigades are in training. To them we must add the Consolidated Rifle Brigade, made up of volunteer/mobilized ground personnel of the Air Force. It's in the same exact situation as the 144th Infantry Brigade.\n\nDuring 2023, too, the Ground Forces created several new separate rifle battalions that are not easy at all to keep track of. \n\nThen there are the five new mechanized brigades created in October (from 150th to 154th). They were raised recently, so I guess they are still in the initial formation phase. The 151st should be the one in the most advanced creation stage. Equipping them will be a huge challenge, though. I imagine they will be equipped partly with Soviet gear (the Ukrainian stock of T-64s and BMP-1s turned out to be larger than previously thought, for instance) and partly with Western gear (Leopard 1A5s, M113s, MRAPs...), I have no idea regarding artillery.\n\n\nThere are a couple of mechanized brigades that were activated just after the invasion that have disappeared since early 2023, namely the 61st and 62nd. Despite the fact that there is evidence that the former received T-72EAs and RM-70 MLRS during the summer. The 101st Brigade for Protection of the General Staff has also disappeared since early 2023. \n\nSeveral TDF brigades have been in the process of restoration for months (particularly some of the ones involved in the Bakhmut campaign). It might be a problem for them to return to full operational capabilities, as to my knowledge (but I could be wrong), TDF units are made up of volunteers who sign a contract with the TDF unit located in their province - specifically, to TDF went the bulk of the civilians who rushed in as volunteers during the first weeks of the invasion. As for the National Guard, there was a new expansion in October: some regiments were reformed into brigades, some battalions reformed into regiments, and new separate battalions were created.",

A combination of many MALD missiles and other fire-control drones would allow Ukraine to emulate Wild-Weasel tactics. Follow-up anti-radiation missiles to respond to Russian air-defense units and strike packages seem fairly plausible if all or more of the F-16\u2019s are committed. Follow-up anti-radiation missiles to respond to Russian air-defense units and strike packages seem fairly plausible if all or more of the F-16\u2019s are committed. Given the general success of these tactics during the Gulf War and Invasion of Iraq in 2003 by coalition with only about 100 planes and 812 combat sorties, it could be fairly plausible on a smaller scale with the estimated 60 F-16s \\[Source: [The Winning of Air Supremacy In Operation Desert Storm, 3\\]](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2009/P7837.pdf)\n\nAlthough Ukraine doesn\u2019t have the numbers or available missiles to conduct such high intensity combat sorties compared to the coalition, a concentrated effort on one front I think could have a similar effect. Considering that the Russian Air Force failed SEAD operations early on in the war with only roughly 140 sorties a day spread over Ukraine which is larger than Iraq, I think Ukraine could have better success over a smaller airspace area. \\[Source: [RAND](https://static.rusi.org/SR-Russian-Air-War-Ukraine-web-final.pdf), 8\\] On another note, the goal of the southern Ukraine counteroffensive was to get a breakthrough that they could exploit and reach the Asov Sea. Couldn\u2019t the Ukrainians achieve a more significant breakthrough using Wild Weasel tactics once enough planes are obtained and concentrated onto one front? Once the air defense network is degraded or destroyed it would leave room for CAS and other strike operations to accompany the advancing ground units as Russian artillery units and operators would be at threat of Ukrainian planes.",

[Source: <a href=\"https://static.rusi.org/SR-Russian-Air-War-Ukraine-web-final.pdf\">RAND</a>, 10]</p>\n\n<p>Since Ukraine will be obtaining and are currently training on F-16s from August, they would have a much better aircraft compared to their SU-27s and Mig-29s. [Source: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-ukraine-f16-decision-russia-64538af7c10489d7c2243dadbad31008\">AP News</a>] The author from the RAND article mentions how Ukraine could and most likely get access to Western missiles such as ATACM, AMRAAM, JDAM, HARM\u2019s etc. However, in addition to those missiles, F-16s can be equipped with MALD missiles and other equipment to jam or target anti-air systems and Ukraine has already sported some of them [Source: <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/evidence-of-adm-160-miniature-air-launched-decoy-use-by-ukraine-emerges\">The Drive</a>].With the Ukrainian already receiving access to the Storm Shadow cruise missile and the F-16\u2019s being better integrated with Western technology, they could conduct better attacks on communication/strategic targets first before going on the SEAD mission. A combination of many MALD missiles and other fire-control drones would allow Ukraine to emulate Wild-Weasel tactics. Follow-up anti-radiation missiles to respond to Russian air-defense units and strike packages seem fairly plausible if all or more of the F-16\u2019s are committed. Follow-up anti-radiation missiles to respond to Russian air-defense units and strike packages seem fairly plausible if all or more of the F-16\u2019s are committed. Given the general success of these tactics during the Gulf War and Invasion of Iraq in 2003 by coalition with only about 100 planes and 812 combat sorties, it could be fairly plausible on a smaller scale with the estimated 60 F-16s [Source: <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2009/P7837.pdf\">The Winning of Air Supremacy In Operation Desert Storm, 3]</a></p>\n\n<p>Although Ukraine doesn\u2019t have the numbers or available missiles to conduct such high intensity combat sorties compared to the coalition, a concentrated effort on one front I think could have a similar effect. Considering that the Russian Air Force failed SEAD operations early on in the war with only roughly 140 sorties a day spread over Ukraine which is larger than Iraq, I think Ukraine could have better success over a smaller airspace area. [Source: <a href=\"https://static.rusi.org/SR-Russian-Air-War-Ukraine-web-final.pdf\">RAND</a>, 8] On another note, the goal of the southern Ukraine counteroffensive was to get a breakthrough that they could exploit and reach the Asov Sea. Couldn\u2019t the Ukrainians achieve a more significant breakthrough using Wild Weasel tactics once enough planes are obtained and concentrated onto one front? Once the air defense network is degraded or destroyed it would leave room for CAS and other strike operations to accompany the advancing ground units as Russian artillery units and operators would be at threat of Ukrainian planes.</p>\n</div>",
