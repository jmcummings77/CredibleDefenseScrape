These aren't Rambos you have on hand.\n\nThis right in the middle of the Ukrainians' fireworks party. You have to secure your logistics first or at least find some, good, way to get them to stop blowing your depots, and you're gonna resume serious offensive operations in the middle of that problem? Like, your artillery is 70% of your strategy here. They're going right for arty ammo. Lots of your arty ammo. And with the state of Russian artillery ammo from the middle of Siberia, they need all the rusted-to-hell shells they can get.\n\nWe'll have to wait a few days to see if this assessment is truly correct.

It wont be the most modern model, but one of the earlier ones.\n\n Not sure if it's happening, if the f15/16 training is an indication that the Gripen's are off the table or if it's a more the merrier situation.

F-15s, or F-15Es could be used for flying CAP, same with F-16s and as interceptors. I feel like you&#39;re missing a key piece of information here. SEAD targets enemy air defenses, not other aircraft. This means electronic warfare aircraft, like the EA-18G, to jam radar and missile guidance systems. You need the AN/ASQ-213 pod and/or RC-135U/V/W to detect enemy radar transmissions to be able to fire anti-radiation missiles at them, the AGM-88. Once the enemy has switched to turning off their search radars to avoid this and only engaging their tracking/illumination radars to fire at targets visually spotted before hand(which is how the F-117 over Serbia was shot down) then you need F-16CJ/DJ to run Wild Weasel sorties. You need to bait the SAM site to engaging it&#39;s radar by providing a target, then slam a HARM at it. Traditionally this was done in pairs, one aircraft would run light to bait the SAM site then go supersonic to evade the missile(s) while a heavier aircraft further back would fire off AGM-45 Shrikes. A AWACS may provide targeting data for a cruise missile by detecting the launch site of a SAM, if it doesn&#39;t displace. But it has very little to do with SEAD.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention the US, who is the absolute master of running SEAD, has never tried to do so against a enemy which such heavy and modern SAM density.</p>\n</div>",

The man making the video may not be a Russian agent. His commanding officer may not be a Russian agent. But because they're not getting intel-sharing from the West, they could be receiving their intel from a friendly Russian officer, for example, someone who maybe even claims to be disgruntled with the war or who just genuinely has personal contacts with the military academy. Of course, all that intel could be quite easily manipulated to suit a Russian narrative. Not to mention that a fair amount of people probably go into the proposal and execution of such videos and any one of them could be getting leveraged for influence in what goes into the content. Finally, you have the release and promotion of the video itself and promotion of content on the internet that suits their purposes is something we know that the Russians are particularly effective at. It's not as if the FSB presses just one lever, they press as many as they can within reason to get what they want. As far as disinfo operations go, this is a pretty good one for reaching the general public of the West imo. An objectively neutral country (at least to your average viewer), a credentialed authority figure, well-orchestrated summaries, widely promoted.  \n\n\nAgain, just playing this theory out, not saying it's the gospel truth, but it would be far more complicated of a scheme than just \"the guy talking is a Russian agent\". The FSB have definitely been kneecapped in Ukraine, but let's give them a little more credit.",

The man making the video may not be a Russian agent. His commanding officer may not be a Russian agent. But because they&#39;re not getting intel-sharing from the West, they could be receiving their intel from a friendly Russian officer, for example, someone who maybe even claims to be disgruntled with the war or who just genuinely has personal contacts with the military academy. Of course, all that intel could be quite easily manipulated to suit a Russian narrative. Not to mention that a fair amount of people probably go into the proposal and execution of such videos and any one of them could be getting leveraged for influence in what goes into the content. Finally, you have the release and promotion of the video itself and promotion of content on the internet that suits their purposes is something we know that the Russians are particularly effective at. It&#39;s not as if the FSB presses just one lever, they press as many as they can within reason to get what they want. As far as disinfo operations go, this is a pretty good one for reaching the general public of the West imo. An objectively neutral country (at least to your average viewer), a credentialed authority figure, well-orchestrated summaries, widely promoted.  </p>\n\n<p>Again, just playing this theory out, not saying it&#39;s the gospel truth, but it would be far more complicated of a scheme than just &quot;the guy talking is a Russian agent&quot;. The FSB have definitely been kneecapped in Ukraine, but let&#39;s give them a little more credit.</p>\n</div>",

Multiple PGMs hit a single office building and only killed 23 people. If they wanted terror they'd have spread the missile strikes out to hit multiple places that much guaranteed to be much more crowded, like shopping centers, train stations, churches, etc. Look at WW2, when terror bombing was legit. They went out of their way to maximize damage. Same even goes for recent Islamist terror attacks, they nearly always pick targets for the maximum body count. Same even goes for mass shooters. Economy of force and psychological shock are the two greatest factors. \n\nPeople were calling the Kyiv mall bombing terror too and that was just an errand bomb, ie collateral damage. I think the Vinnytsya strike was an intelligence driven strike either based on bad intel or else there was something at the location that the UA are keeping a secret. Why keep it a secret? One, so they don't do the Russian's job and do their bomb damage assessment for them, and two they can weaponize the IO value of the strike and the collateral damage by both firing up the populace and using it as more evidence to the West for more weaponry of the exact sort they want but are being denied.",

Not just the ones that are favorable to Russia, but them the ones favorable to Ukraine, like this, they don't make much sense and suggest a lack of familiarity with the subject matter.\n\nThis post, for example, is optimistic about Ukraine holding Odessa, but the reasoning is just bizarre. You bring up three points.\n\n1. Snake Island is important to an attack on Odessa.\n\nIt's really far away from Odessa. It's really small. It's rocky, so hard to land things. Right next to it are miles of minimally defended Ukrainian coastline that would be far more attractive to land on. They don't need a staging base, Sevastapol is a day or two away. The best argument you could make for it's importance is that air defenses can be based there, but those same air defenses are already being deployed on the back of ships.\n\n2. Mines are keeping Odessa safe.\n\nThis part is true, but it's been true since the opening days of the war, because Ukraine mined their waters right away. It's strange that you mention it as if it's silly recent thing. It's a large part of why an amphibious landing hasn't been an issue for months. (The other major component is that an amphibious landing alone has been recognized as insufficient for a long time. It would make the most sense to use an amphibious landing to flank the defenders as land troops approached.)\n\n3. It's so dangerous commercial ships can't get insured.\n\nInsurance companies generally are risk adverse. They don't want to lose their ships. This is analogous to saying that soldiers under 25 shouldn't drive tanks because their insurance rates are higher than older drivers. Risks are commonly acceptable in a military context that would scare off insurance companies. The fact that insurance companies won't insure an area doesn't contribute any information to whether or not a military operation is feasible there.",
