Ukraine of course will have lost the most this war, followed possibly by Russia, and then it's EU; principally Germany. USA/China/India all gain from this war in numerous ways, the only possible 'fail' point you can ascribe to US interests is in the diplomatic/political sphere; but that's I think whatever because USA can always just go full isolationist mode. In terms of economy they're better doing great.\n\nGermany and EU on the other hand is going to pay dearly for this mess in multiple ways, none of which will actually ensure a return to status quo(or better). The *only* possible pathway I see is if France actually commits and drops US protests, Germany decides to follow France(pretty tough ask considering they're so reliant on USA's strategic commands nowadays); and the rest of EU does the same. In such a scenario, EU could ostensibly dictate where this war eventually ends up; maybe no in the first year or even two; but in the long term it could. After that, dropping USA's strategic command and chartering an independent course would at the very least produce something positive for EU. Then the best thing to do would be to make a deal with both Russia and China, and play them against USA.\n\nI don't know why people just expect EU to fall on the sword that USA has conjured up. In the most basic realpolitik way, it makes absolutely zero sense. Ideologically, sure; we are strong allies and frontier of the West yadda yadda. That doesn't matter when economy crashes and people start asking questions.

Ukraine of course will have lost the most this war, followed possibly by Russia, and then it&#39;s EU; principally Germany. USA/China/India all gain from this war in numerous ways, the only possible &#39;fail&#39; point you can ascribe to US interests is in the diplomatic/political sphere; but that&#39;s I think whatever because USA can always just go full isolationist mode. In terms of economy they&#39;re better doing great.</p>\n\n<p>Germany and EU on the other hand is going to pay dearly for this mess in multiple ways, none of which will actually ensure a return to status quo(or better). The <em>only</em> possible pathway I see is if France actually commits and drops US protests, Germany decides to follow France(pretty tough ask considering they&#39;re so reliant on USA&#39;s strategic commands nowadays); and the rest of EU does the same. In such a scenario, EU could ostensibly dictate where this war eventually ends up; maybe no in the first year or even two; but in the long term it could. After that, dropping USA&#39;s strategic command and chartering an independent course would at the very least produce something positive for EU. Then the best thing to do would be to make a deal with both Russia and China, and play them against USA.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know why people just expect EU to fall on the sword that USA has conjured up.

I&#39;m just trying to resolve the contradiction between &quot;CS is a chemical weapon and chemical weapons are agreed by all civilized countries to be horrible war crimes&quot; and &quot;every country is willing to use CS&quot;. Regardless of your personal opinions, you seem to be describing a inconsistency which is so blatant and widespread that it begs for an explanation.</p>\n</div>",

Additionally, Russia has shown no ability throughout the war to carry out successful maneuver warfare and when they did attempt to do so in 2022 with much better equipment and huge stockpiles in reserve they were defeated by a significantly less capable Ukrainian army with no FPVs or ground drones, much more limited long-range strike capabilities and limited fixed defenses outside of the Donbas. Ukraine is finally starting to carry out large-scale fortification works behind the front and the longer the current attrition/slow advance goes on their defenses will only get stronger and Russia's stockpiles will only get emptier. Russia's financial resources are also being used up to fund the high pay for volunteers as well as the general costs of war and it's not clear to me if Russia can maintain its current capability to recruit volunteers for more than another year or two assuming they can still find people willing to go.",

Geopolitical theories rarely (but not never) make it out of the cradle if they don't occasionally get things right.\n\nI hadn't read that book (though the wikipedia entry makes me suspect I've heard its arguments many, many, **many** times) but there are things I agree with Mearshimer on even if overall he's become a meme.\n\n-----\n\nRegarding \"Israel lobby\" discourse (again, I hadn't read that book but I think everyone remotely in geopolitics has heard that argument more times than they've drank mother's milk), I will say the following - pro-Israel lobbyists spend a lot of money and have a lot of apparent success, but it's not like all a political issue needs to do to become mainstream is lobby a lot.  If it was, there wouldn't be that much bitterness about the Israeli lobby.\n\nIn general, my overarching theory (get it?  I panned overarching theories and I'm about to deliver one.  It's ironic!) is that most of the time \"my arguments aren't popular because my opponent has an S-tier propaganda machine\" takes are c-pium, arguably the most common c-pium in geopolitics.  \n\nAnd it's not just people who I disagree with that are hooked on that c-pium, everyone does it.  Like people like to reiterate the power of Russia's propaganda machines in the west - but in reality, they're not nearly as strong as people think.  \n\nAs a more personal example, as a kid I always resented the way gun control is handled in this country (I still do), and I blamed it on the all powerful NRA lobby.  And don't get me wrong, the NRA lobby is incredibly powerful, just like the Israel lobby.  It's one of the most powerful internal politics lobbies in the US.  It just took me until adulthood to realize that the reason it's so powerful is that its opinions are organically held by a huge swath of people, and unfortunately not just conservatives either.\n\nAnd I feel like maybe more people should come to that realization about some other issues.
