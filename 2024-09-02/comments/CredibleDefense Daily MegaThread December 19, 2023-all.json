A month ago they managed to [conquer the city of Nyala](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67226076) which has more than a million inhabitants and is the second largest city of Sudan. With it they have managed to consolidate most of Darfur which constitute western Sudan.

A big factor at least is probably the military support from the UAE to the RSF, possibly through Chad and the Central African Republic, with Wagner forces also being present in some capacity. Does anyone else here have any better ideas as to why things are going in the favour of the RSF? They seem to be doing quite well despite the advantage of the SAF having some semblence of an airforce while the RSF don't. Possibly this is because of, as has been rumoured,  a considerable amount of the infantry defecting to the RSF at the start of the conflict.\n\nI am very far removed from this conflict so if you have any corrections please do tell.",

            "body": "Extremely ambitious seems like an understatement if the leaks regarding struggles with regional mobilization totals are accurate. 400-500 thousand men would nearly total the number of Ukrainians already on the frontline if Zelensky is to be believed.\n\nUkraine does have the raw population to *technically* do this, but at what cost? They already heavily mobilized a large portion of their more receptive citizens. Now they'll be left with attempting to mobilize younger age categories, women, those who also previously didn't volunteer and may make poor conscripts as the war enters a more difficult phase. Not to forget the impact this will have on Ukrainian industry and general morale.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Border Guard and Police Force together number approximately 200,000. It's far more likely that we see Ukraine struggle to meet this optimistic 2024 number by continually drafting and drawing upon these groups alongside the general trickle of conscription that we've seen thusfar. *Moving the numbers around* so to speak since many of these units are already engaged in a technical sense.\n\nAlso whilst I see a lot of people mention Ukraine's raw population, how it's nearly 40 million people, both Ukraine and Russia could keep going like this for years etc. The devil is really in the details here and it's important we don't get carried away looking at raw population totals as it paints a sometimes misleading picture of the realities of Ukrainian mobilization options.\n\n\\-----------------------------------  \nThe following is a rambling mess of napkin math and interesting population demographic breakdowns alongside industry stats relating to those in the population eligible for conscription, feel free to ignore me from this point on.  \n\\-----------------------------------\n\n**For a start Ukraine has approximately 31.1 Million people remaining in its territory.** You can't mobilize people that are in occupied territories or have been in occupied territories for the better part of several years or even nearly a decade. So already we're far below the 40 Million total I see quoted frequently.\n\nYou also can't mobilize the **nearly 4 million Ukrainians that have left Ukraine** (or at the very least you'll struggle to pull large numbers from this category, I wouldn't blame any Ukrainian citizen for not wishing to answer a conscription notice when them and their family are now safely in a different country).\n\nThe only semi-accurate data we have dates from 2018, so the totals don't include the reduction in population that has occurred due to the war and annual migration since then so we are left to approximate based on demographic breakdown ratios which will be imperfect. That being said whilst these numbers aren't overly accurate, the broader picture they paint isn't particularly good for Ukraine's mobilization efforts.\n\nIn 2018 approximately 14 Million people were accounted in the categories of 0-15 years old and 65+. There will have been some shift in these numbers come 2023, but it's important to note that this represents a huge chunk of Ukraine's remaining population that may be eligible for conscription. Assuming the ratios from 2018 hold true today, in terms of demographic breakdown, then Ukraine would have approximately 4.96 Million people in the 0-15 year old category and 5.12 Million in the 65+ category.\n\nThis is *extremely* rough napkin math, and there will be some differentiation in terms of the regions Russia now occupies and the disposition of those who left Ukraine over the last 5 years since then, but it's worth pointing out that if the demographic breakdown holds true then nearly **10 Million people** of the 31.1 Million remaining in Ukraine are **completely non eligible for military service.** ***Leaving only 21 Million people***, of which many are still on the extreme ends of the spectrum and non eligible due to a variety of reasons being either old age, medical ineligibility, below the age of 18, key industry etc.\n\nIf we were just counting the men between the ages of 20 and 59 then Ukraine has approximately 8.9 Million men. If we wanted to exclude men past the age of say 40 (as the average age of the Ukrainian Armed forces today indicates that this group has already largely volunteered and been mobilized) **then Ukraine has approximately 5.7 Million men remaining that it could draw upon (minus those already active in the armed forces).**\n\nFrom there onward you then have to breakdown how many of these remaining, generally already employed men, are employed in key industries and considered critical workers in regards to the government, energy sector, logistics, which Ukraine is highly reliant on, and other key industries. There are some people that you simply cannot mobilize without causing an equal and opposite negative impact to your armed forces or adversely the stability of the country itself.\n\nJust some quick rough stats on people (these include women) in vital industries that will be harder to mobilize:\n\n* Energy sector: 1 Million\n* Information/Communications/Telecoms: 0.5 Million\n* Transport and Logistics: 1.3 Million\n* Public Sector: 5.1 Million- (Government Administration: 1.3 Million)- (Education: 2.3 Million)- (Healthcare: 1.5 Million)\n\nThese are just a few choice selections of categories that Ukraine will struggle to conscript from without causing serious damage to the stability of the government and vital services/utilities across Ukraine. This doesn't include Ukraine's large manufacturing industry nor the defense industry, both of which are largely employed contributing to the Ukrainian armed forces and conscription from which would cause serious negative impacts for the armed forces that would outweigh the conscription.\n\nNow granted there will be differing breakdowns of women/men and various age categories in those roles, but it doesn't leave a massive pool of military age men from which Ukraine can reliably continue drawing conscripts from. Ukraine is going to rapidly run into a brick wall in regards to conscripting men from key industries and positions that will have increasingly adverse impacts to Ukraine as a whole.\n\nThe groundwork is already in place to solve this via conscription of women, with recent law changes opening up the number of eligible women and building the infrastructure for more widespread conscription. That being said widespread conscription of military age women would also run into a lot of the same issues mentioned above in regards to key workers. Education, Government Administration and Healthcare in particular are likely heavily populated by women and would run into serious issues if widespread conscription were to occur.\n\nI'm not saying that Ukraine will not be able to conscript at all, just that the challenges this will pose for them are going to continue to grow until it reaches breaking point, which is in my opinion much sooner than most people seem to believe.  \n\n\n\\------------------  \nDisclaimer: A below comment has helpfully pointed out that some of the data regarding specific sector employment may contain double counting, whilst the degree of this cannot be verified as unfortunately the data doesn't go deep enough it's worth noting that the employment data by sector does not have a distinction for part time employment nor does it exclude those who have several jobs or in several fields, so as with all data take it with a grain of salt.",

        "body": "Someone had predicted that Russia was instigating the border situation making Finland close its borders to keep Russians in when they mobilized but reality is wilder and much less humane than fiction \n\n[Russia luring migrants from Finnish border for war in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67647379)\n\n\nThe BBC has seen evidence of several cases in which foreigners were rushed into a military camp on the border with Ukraine, days after they were picked up for breaching immigration laws.\n\nThe practice of coercing people in pre-deportation detention centres to sign contracts for army service in Ukraine is not new, but the numbers swelled as foreign migrants arrived at Russia's 1,340-km (833-mile) border with Finland.\n\nFinland temporarily closed all eight of its Russian border crossings, accusing Moscow of channelling migrants and asylum seekers there as part of a destabilisation campaign after the government in Helsinki joined Nato earlier this year.\n\nAnalysis of court hearings in Karelia, one of three Russian regions bordering Finland, showed that in the past three weeks, 236 people were arrested for staying in Russia without valid visas, destined for deportation. The picture was similar in the other two border regions of Leningrad and Murmansk.\n\nAmong those appearing in court in Karelia was a Somali man in his 40s, who was arrested in mid-November, sentenced to a fine of 2,000 roubles (\u00a317; \u20ac20) and detained pending deportation - a standard procedure for anyone without an appropriate visa.\n\nAwad and at least a dozen other inmates held in the pre-deportation centre in Petrozavodsk, Karelia's capital, were approached by military representatives soon after their arrest and were offered \"a job for the state\". They were promised good pay, medical care and permission to stay in Russia on completing a one-year army contract.\n\nAwad is not his real name, but the BBC has confirmed his identity.\n\nHe had arrived in Russia in mid-July and went to neighbouring Belarus, trying for months to enter Poland. By early November, he said internet chat groups popular with asylum seekers were abuzz with news that the Russian border with Finland had become more accessible.\n\nUnprecedented numbers of migrants began turning up at Finland's border and applying for refugee status.\n\nFinnish authorities accused Russia of encouraging the influx and abandoning their usual visa checks for travellers entering the border zone.\n\nThey highlighted the organised distribution of bicycles, most of them brand new, which migrants used to cover the last stretch of the Russian border zone, bypassing Russia's ban on approaching its border posts on foot.\n\nFinland's last border crossing at Raja-Jooseppi shut on 29 November, although authorities in Helsinki were planning to reopen the border later this month. Those arriving by air or sea can still seek asylum.\n\nAwad told the BBC that he hired a taxi on 14 November and, along with another Somali migrant, was driven for several hours from St Petersburg to Lakhdenpokhya, a town in Karelia 30km from the Finnish border.\n\nThey were acting on their own and no-one had helped them, he maintained.\n\nHis case was typical. His month-long visa had run out in August and when the taxi was stopped by police for a check, he was arrested. Awad and a dozen other people were sentenced the next day and moved to the detention centre.\n\nHuman rights groups say that foreigners using Russia as a transit point in their journey to the West routinely overstay their short-term visas while trying to cross borders with EU countries.\n\nSo when police began arresting those who did not have valid Russian visas in mid-November, it marked a change in Russia's approach to migrants at the Finnish border. \n\nThe documents offering a job which were presented by officials to the Somali and others were in Russian, which none of the group could understand. He and others assumed they would be given army-related work inside Russia, he said.\n\n\"We were not given the contract documents and [they] were not even shown properly. We asked [what the jobs will be] but they told us that it is simple and good,\" he told the BBC.\n\nFearing deportation to Somalia, where he said his life had been threatened several times by al-Shabab militants, he signed the offer, along with five other Somalis, five men from Arab countries and a Cuban national. They were put on a bus and were driven south. \n\nThe BBC has asked Russia's interior ministry in Karelia for information on how many other inmates have been released from such detention centres, but so far there has been no response.\n\nWe have also confirmed the identity of another man in the group, whose name matched the court records in Karelia. \n\nSeparately, an Iraqi man who was also arrested close to Finland's border told human rights activists that he too was being pressured to sign an army contract as a way to void the deportation order.\n\nHe said his life was in grave danger if he returned to Iraq. It is not known if he agreed to sign.\n\nEarlier this week, Somalia's Radio Kulmiye interviewed an unnamed representative from the Somali community in Belarus, who said at least 60 Somali nationals were being held in Russian detention centres and were being approached by military recruiters.\n\nAccording to him, at least eight men had agreed to sign a contract with the Russian army.\n\nAwad told BBC that his bus journey ended at the border with Ukraine, in a muddy military camp made of large tents.\n\nThat was when his group realised they were being sent to fight, he said: \"We were told a contract year with training and options with good pay and care, but no Ukrainian borders and war. Everything we were told was a lie.\"\n\nThe BBC has again approached the Russian interior ministry for comment on allegations that foreign detainees are being offered army contracts in exchange for their release.\n\n**The foreigners at that point demanded that their contracts were annulled.** Awad said officials at the camp threatened them with long prison sentences for breaching military laws, but later retreated, saying that the job offers would be cancelled and deportation procedures would resume.\n\nFour men in the group had received letters confirming that, he said. The BBC has not seen those letters.\n\nFor now, they remain in the military camp. Awad said he had been told a \"video session with a court\" would be conducted soon, but was unable to provide details on what the hearing would be about.\n\nHe is adamant he has been duped into signing up to the Russian army, although his only defence is that he did not fully understand the offer made to him.\n\n**\"I said no, because I don't know what I signed and it is not written in my language,\" he said. \"I am an asylum seeker, not a soldier.\"**",

Those arriving by air or sea can still seek asylum.</p>\n\n<p>Awad told the BBC that he hired a taxi on 14 November and, along with another Somali migrant, was driven for several hours from St Petersburg to Lakhdenpokhya, a town in Karelia 30km from the Finnish border.</p>\n\n<p>They were acting on their own and no-one had helped them, he maintained.</p>\n\n<p>His case was typical. His month-long visa had run out in August and when the taxi was stopped by police for a check, he was arrested. Awad and a dozen other people were sentenced the next day and moved to the detention centre.</p>\n\n<p>Human rights groups say that foreigners using Russia as a transit point in their journey to the West routinely overstay their short-term visas while trying to cross borders with EU countries.</p>\n\n<p>So when police began arresting those who did not have valid Russian visas in mid-November, it marked a change in Russia&#39;s approach to migrants at the Finnish border. </p>\n\n<p>The documents offering a job which were presented by officials to the Somali and others were in Russian, which none of the group could understand. He and others assumed they would be given army-related work inside Russia, he said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We were not given the contract documents and [they] were not even shown properly. We asked [what the jobs will be] but they told us that it is simple and good,&quot; he told the BBC.</p>\n\n<p>Fearing deportation to Somalia, where he said his life had been threatened several times by al-Shabab militants, he signed the offer, along with five other Somalis, five men from Arab countries and a Cuban national. They were put on a bus and were driven south. </p>\n\n<p>The BBC has asked Russia&#39;s interior ministry in Karelia for information on how many other inmates have been released from such detention centres, but so far there has been no response.</p>\n\n<p>We have also confirmed the identity of another man in the group, whose name matched the court records in Karelia. </p>\n\n<p>Separately, an Iraqi man who was also arrested close to Finland&#39;s border told human rights activists that he too was being pressured to sign an army contract as a way to void the deportation order.</p>\n\n<p>He said his life was in grave danger if he returned to Iraq. It is not known if he agreed to sign.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this week, Somalia&#39;s Radio Kulmiye interviewed an unnamed representative from the Somali community in Belarus, who said at least 60 Somali nationals were being held in Russian detention centres and were being approached by military recruiters.</p>\n\n<p>According to him, at least eight men had agreed to sign a contract with the Russian army.</p>\n\n<p>Awad told BBC that his bus journey ended at the border with Ukraine, in a muddy military camp made of large tents.</p>\n\n<p>That was when his group realised they were being sent to fight, he said: &quot;We were told a contract year with training and options with good pay and care, but no Ukrainian borders and war. Everything we were told was a lie.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The BBC has again approached the Russian interior ministry for comment on allegations that foreign detainees are being offered army contracts in exchange for their release.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The foreigners at that point demanded that their contracts were annulled.</strong> Awad said officials at the camp threatened them with long prison sentences for breaching military laws, but later retreated, saying that the job offers would be cancelled and deportation procedures would resume.</p>\n\n<p>Four men in the group had received letters confirming that, he said. The BBC has not seen those letters.</p>\n\n<p>For now, they remain in the military camp. Awad said he had been told a &quot;video session with a court&quot; would be conducted soon, but was unable to provide details on what the hearing would be about.</p>\n\n<p>He is adamant he has been duped into signing up to the Russian army, although his only defence is that he did not fully understand the offer made to him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;I said no, because I don&#39;t know what I signed and it is not written in my language,&quot; he said. &quot;I am an asylum seeker, not a soldier.&quot;</strong></p>\n</div>",

Not what you want it to be. What do you think it actually started out as, and what's it turned into. \n\nIt's early October, Zelensky is given a folder describing the cross river operation. Whatever he signed off on, what do you think it said? What's the mission? What's the objective? What's the commander's intent? What's the enemy situation? What's the Course of Action? What's the timeline? \n\nIt's a week from Xmas, what were they thinking about Krynky before the NYT and Kyiv Independent metaphorically shit in Zelensky's Christmas stocking? \n\n>They could.  Do they?\n\nUnless the Dnieper crossing operation is the one place in Ukraine that Russia decided not to do counterbattery, then yes, they at least would try, and trying requires they at least bait the UAF arty to reveal their locations. \n\nIt makes no sense the one place the Russians can offset the **ONLY** tactical advantage that those poor bastard UAF Marines possess, that the Russians would elect not to try.\n\nI'm not even implying Russian counterbattery is successful, only that they're likely trying. \n\n>In fact, that NYT article included interviews with the artillery and drone crews, who have made their opinion known about how the battle is going.\n\nYeah, UAF arty and FPV drone units are racking up Russian mechanized kills, heavily going after Russian arty. So following the same tactics they used all summer and fall. Nothing new there. \n\nMeanwhile, since last winter the Russians prioritize Lancets for counterbattery work, that can range all UAF arty. Plus having other means of finding UAF drone operators to get them too (don't ask me the specifics on how that works, but it's [mentioned in this podcast](https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/the-drone-wars-how-consumer-tech-is-shaping-the-ukraine-war)). So nothing new there either. \n\nBoth sides would be using the exact same TTPs in the Krynky operation that they use elsewhere. Unless they aren't. \n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian rear areas on the West bank were being targeted with glide bombs, [they were routinely hitting Kherson City](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/europe/kherson-ukraine.html).\n\n*\"Six weeks ago, there were one or two of these bombs a day across the region, he added, and now there are somewhere around 30 to 40.\"*\n\nBut they aren't going after UAF arty, C3, etc? Especially when those are hurting Russian forces so badly? Nah, I'm not buying that at all. \n\nThat also requires Teplinsky to be the stupidest general in Ukraine. And he's definitely not. He got that job because he doesn't suck.",

What&#39;s the timeline? </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a week from Xmas, what were they thinking about Krynky before the NYT and Kyiv Independent metaphorically shit in Zelensky&#39;s Christmas stocking? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They could.  Do they?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless the Dnieper crossing operation is the one place in Ukraine that Russia decided not to do counterbattery, then yes, they at least would try, and trying requires they at least bait the UAF arty to reveal their locations. </p>\n\n<p>It makes no sense the one place the Russians can offset the <strong>ONLY</strong> tactical advantage that those poor bastard UAF Marines possess, that the Russians would elect not to try.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not even implying Russian counterbattery is successful, only that they&#39;re likely trying. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In fact, that NYT article included interviews with the artillery and drone crews, who have made their opinion known about how the battle is going.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, UAF arty and FPV drone units are racking up Russian mechanized kills, heavily going after Russian arty. So following the same tactics they used all summer and fall. Nothing new there. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, since last winter the Russians prioritize Lancets for counterbattery work, that can range all UAF arty. Plus having other means of finding UAF drone operators to get them too (don&#39;t ask me the specifics on how that works, but it&#39;s <a href=\"https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/the-drone-wars-how-consumer-tech-is-shaping-the-ukraine-war\">mentioned in this podcast</a>). So nothing new there either. </p>\n\n<p>Both sides would be using the exact same TTPs in the Krynky operation that they use elsewhere. Unless they aren&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Ukrainian rear areas on the West bank were being targeted with glide bombs, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/world/europe/kherson-ukraine.html\">they were routinely hitting Kherson City</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Six weeks ago, there were one or two of these bombs a day across the region, he added, and now there are somewhere around 30 to 40.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>But they aren&#39;t going after UAF arty, C3, etc? Especially when those are hurting Russian forces so badly? Nah, I&#39;m not buying that at all. </p>\n\n<p>That also requires Teplinsky to be the stupidest general in Ukraine. And he&#39;s definitely not. He got that job because he doesn&#39;t suck.</p>\n</div>",

Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and startup Anduril are in play to field the Air Force\u2019s collaborative combat aircraft. | Breaking Defense | December 2023](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/12/exclusive-5-companies-in-early-running-for-air-forces-cca-drone-wingmen/)\n\n*Defense mainstays Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and startup Anduril are in the pool of vendors so far selected by the Air Force for an early stage of the CCA program, according to a source familiar with the process. A down select could eliminate some vendors by the summer, the source said.*\n\n*It\u2019s not clear how many companies could move forward after the downselect, when other vendors could join in, or what other firms are serving as subcontractors in the effort.
