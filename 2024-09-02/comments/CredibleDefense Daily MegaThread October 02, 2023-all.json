Instead, the missile launchers will be fixed, most likely being similar to those of the current Aegis Ashore sites.*\n\n*VADM Jon Hill stated earlier this year that the agency was looking at alternative setups to the current Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland.

Are mortars and grenade launchers ISR in control of the assault groups, or is it more top down with those types of low level indirect fire under command of higher command? (Company, regiment)\n\nAFAIK, there aren't any squad or platoon level heavy weapons in either the UAF or RuAF organization. Heavy weapons, be they automatic grenade launchers or mortars, are battalion or higher level assets (brigade, regiment) that are pushed down when necessary. Control would likely revert to the ground force commander, who dictates how they will be used in the fires plan of the attack and then gives commands during. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>With the switch over to dispersed infantry assaults, how are the various fighting vehicles employed? From my understanding, the Russians were the first to pull them back and Ukraine throughout the war has attached single and double tank attachments which act as fire support, but stay back. Are vehicles like IMVs, IFVs, APCs, etc. being used as fire support and battle taxis mostly, staying to the back while the dismounted infantry assault?\n\nFor the Russians, tanks perform long range fires with HE-frag ammo, including indirect fires guided by forward observers or drones. \n\nAPC/IFV would sometimes accompany assault groups, as would tanks, but it was very much mission and terrain dependent. For longer advances, APC/IFV would sometimes move troops closer to the front lines before the infantry dismounts. So back to being battle taxis mostly. \n\nLess is known about the UAF, as they are deliberately hiding TTPs. But chances are, they copied the Russians. It is known they are still occasionally going on the attack as part of mechanized mounted assaults. Plus they are being used to ferry troops up to the FLOT, and used for resupply and casualty evacuation when possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We heard a lot about Wagner's tactics for the taking of Bakhmut, with them using echelons for assault, with the last being their cream assault troops.

Are mortars and grenade launchers ISR in control of the assault groups, or is it more top down with those types of low level indirect fire under command of higher command? (Company, regiment)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>AFAIK, there aren&#39;t any squad or platoon level heavy weapons in either the UAF or RuAF organization. Heavy weapons, be they automatic grenade launchers or mortars, are battalion or higher level assets (brigade, regiment) that are pushed down when necessary. Control would likely revert to the ground force commander, who dictates how they will be used in the fires plan of the attack and then gives commands during. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the switch over to dispersed infantry assaults, how are the various fighting vehicles employed? From my understanding, the Russians were the first to pull them back and Ukraine throughout the war has attached single and double tank attachments which act as fire support, but stay back. Are vehicles like IMVs, IFVs, APCs, etc. being used as fire support and battle taxis mostly, staying to the back while the dismounted infantry assault?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the Russians, tanks perform long range fires with HE-frag ammo, including indirect fires guided by forward observers or drones. </p>\n\n<p>APC/IFV would sometimes accompany assault groups, as would tanks, but it was very much mission and terrain dependent. For longer advances, APC/IFV would sometimes move troops closer to the front lines before the infantry dismounts. So back to being battle taxis mostly. </p>\n\n<p>Less is known about the UAF, as they are deliberately hiding TTPs. But chances are, they copied the Russians. It is known they are still occasionally going on the attack as part of mechanized mounted assaults. Plus they are being used to ferry troops up to the FLOT, and used for resupply and casualty evacuation when possible. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We heard a lot about Wagner&#39;s tactics for the taking of Bakhmut, with them using echelons for assault, with the last being their cream assault troops.

He described Baku\u2019s swift moves to reimpose control over Nagorno-Karabakh, internationally recognized as Azerbaijan\u2019s sovereign territory, as \u201ca new system of coordinates.\u201d He said residents should get to know the agreements on living under Azerbaijani rule.\n\n>Many analysts ascribe the Russian failure down to the Kremlin being highly distracted by its war in Ukraine. The focus on the war has undermined Russia\u2019s authority and influence throughout its geopolitical neighborhood, including the Caucasus and Central Asia.\n\n>Moscow\u2019s sway was also diminished when Turkey, Azerbaijan\u2019s powerful military backer, emerged as the victorious regional power broker in the 2020 war that Baku used to seize back most of Nagorno-Karabakh and other Azerbaijani territory taken by Armenia in the first Karabakh war, in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n>But other analysts and officials see darker motives: Moscow betrayed Armenia, for which it had long provided security guarantees, in a conscious shift to accommodate Azerbaijan and Turkey. Some believe Putin was seeking to punish Pashinyan over his search for new Western partners, as the Armenian government in Yerevan seeks to reduce its decades-long dependence on Russia.\n\n>Pashinyan\u2019s supporters fear Moscow may use the largely pro-Kremlin opposition in Armenia to stage protests in a bid to oust the prime minister and drag Yerevan back into Moscow\u2019s fold.\n\n>When Armenia won control of Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990s, hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis were forced to flee. Decades of war ensued.\n\n>But in 2020, heavily armed with advanced weapons from Israel and Turkey purchased using oil and gas riches, Azerbaijan attacked its smaller neighbor, defeating Armenia.\n\n>The truce brokered by Russia allowed it to deploy peacekeepers and border guards and maintain at least the appearance of a role as a regional power broker. But it left uncertain the fate of the breakaway Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh; its capital; Stepanakert; and its Armenian residents.\n\n>Putin has devoted great energy trying to re-create Russia\u2019s lost empire and dominate its ex-Soviet neighbors, so the failure to protect Armenia, a longtime ally, was a striking shift. For other small nations on Russia\u2019s borders, the message was clear: Who could trust Russia in the future?\n\n>\u201cI think it\u2019s a process of managed decline,\u201d said Laurence Broers, an expert on the Caucasus at Chatham House, a London-based policy institute.\n\n>Broers said that Russia had quietly turned away from Armenia toward the powerful regional nexus of Turkey and Azerbaijan, because of Turkey\u2019s importance in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and in regional energy and transportation routes in the South Caucasus.\n\n>\u201cI see it as a pivot to Azerbaijan and becoming a partner in Azerbaijani-Turkish connectivity,\u201d he said.\n\n>Russian peacekeepers patrolled tense areas but \u201cno matter how often they traveled, and how often they patrolled the areas, that did not have any impact,\u201d Vartanyan said.\n\n>\u201cAzerbaijan clearly started testing the Russian peacekeepers and Russia\u2019s readiness to stand for its peacekeepers when the Ukraine invasion started,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the more they were testing, the more it was becoming clear that Russia had no appetite to get involved in any kind of confrontation with Azerbaijan.\u201d\n\n>Vehicles carrying refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh queue on the road leading toward the Armenian border on Monday. (David Ghahramanyan/Reuters)\nWith Nagorno-Karabakh emptying out, the Russian peacekeepers will soon have no mission. The broken trust, however, could reverberate for years.\n\n>\u201cThe Russians are whores! The Turks are whores!\u201d raged 70-year-old Jorik Isakhanyan, using an expletive in Armenian. As he spoke, Isakhanyan was changing a flat tire on his car in Kornidzor, an Armenian border town where he and his wife had fled with no hope of returning to their homeland.\n\n>\u201cThe Russians lied to us and tricked us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told us the peacekeepers would be there and that there would be no more war. Then, at night, they started shelling with artillery and Grads and drones,\u201d he said, referring to Azerbaijani forces.\n\n>For the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, there is also anger at being ignored by the world. For most of the last 10 months, Azerbaijan blocked the Lachin Corridor, causing food shortages.\n\n>Artur Babayan, 26, of Martakert, blamed Russian leaders. \u201cThey either failed to give the right orders or they didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Babayan said. But he was also angry at Armenia\u2019s government, as well as the global community that \u201cwatches and does nothing.\u201d\n\n>\u201cNo governments around the world can provide any safety for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no country in the world who is willing to take actual steps against Turkey and Azerbaijan.\u201d\n\n>The West has never engaged deeply in Armenia\u2019s intractable problems, with the nation perceived as firmly wedded to Moscow. For Armenia, an isolated, landlocked nation, wedged between two enemies, there appeared to be no realistic partner but Russia.\n\n>But when Armenia reached out to others, Moscow threatened repercussions. A decade ago, when Armenia, Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova planned to sign economic agreements with the European Union, the Kremlin saw it as a threat.\n\n>In Yerevan, a Russian diplomat warned that Armenia was on a \u201croad to hell.\u201d Another likened the planned accords to pacts with Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Yerevan caved and dropped the deals.\n\n>Armenia had long relied on the Russia-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which also includes Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. But as Armenia came under threat in recent months, the organization did nothing.\n\n>Increasingly, Pashinyan has slow-walked cooperation with the CSTO. Earlier this month, Armenia skipped CSTO military exercises in Belarus, but welcomed U.S. forces for a 10-day training exercise in Armenia. It also angered Moscow by sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine in early September.\n\n>Even worse, from the Kremlin\u2019s view, was Armenia\u2019s decision to ratify the Rome Statute underpinning the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Putin for alleged war crimes over the deportation of Ukrainian children. Peskov called Armenia\u2019s decision \u201cextremely hostile for us.\u201d\n\n>In an interview with Italy\u2019s la Repubblica in early September, Pashinyan said that Armenia\u2019s history of relying on Russia was a \u201cstrategic mistake.\u201d\n\n>Putin\u2019s distaste for Pashinyan is evident in the vehement condemnations by his diplomats and state propagandists.\n\n>Pashinyan\u2019s attitude toward Putin is also not subtle. At the same CSTO summit, he moved as far from Putin as possible, leaving an obvious gap in the group photo.\n\n>Pashinyan, who helped lead Armenia\u2019s Velvet Revolution protests in 2018 and was twice democratically elected, is not a natural partner for Putin. More relatable is Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, a tough autocrat who broke promises to Western leaders by launching last week\u2019s military operation. Like Putin, Aliyev has a history of brutal rhetoric and inciting hatred of enemies.\n\n>\u201cThe Armenians believed that Russia would protect their sovereignty,\u201d said Paata Zakareishvili, an expert on the Southern Caucasus and former state minister in Georgia. \u201cBut now it\u2019s complete disappointment. They understand Russia will not protect their interests.\u201d",

But it left uncertain the fate of the breakaway Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh; its capital; Stepanakert; and its Armenian residents.</p>\n\n<p>Putin has devoted great energy trying to re-create Russia\u2019s lost empire and dominate its ex-Soviet neighbors, so the failure to protect Armenia, a longtime ally, was a striking shift. For other small nations on Russia\u2019s borders, the message was clear: Who could trust Russia in the future?</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a process of managed decline,\u201d said Laurence Broers, an expert on the Caucasus at Chatham House, a London-based policy institute.</p>\n\n<p>Broers said that Russia had quietly turned away from Armenia toward the powerful regional nexus of Turkey and Azerbaijan, because of Turkey\u2019s importance in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and in regional energy and transportation routes in the South Caucasus.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI see it as a pivot to Azerbaijan and becoming a partner in Azerbaijani-Turkish connectivity,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Russian peacekeepers patrolled tense areas but \u201cno matter how often they traveled, and how often they patrolled the areas, that did not have any impact,\u201d Vartanyan said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAzerbaijan clearly started testing the Russian peacekeepers and Russia\u2019s readiness to stand for its peacekeepers when the Ukraine invasion started,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the more they were testing, the more it was becoming clear that Russia had no appetite to get involved in any kind of confrontation with Azerbaijan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Vehicles carrying refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh queue on the road leading toward the Armenian border on Monday. (David Ghahramanyan/Reuters)\nWith Nagorno-Karabakh emptying out, the Russian peacekeepers will soon have no mission. The broken trust, however, could reverberate for years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Russians are whores! The Turks are whores!\u201d raged 70-year-old Jorik Isakhanyan, using an expletive in Armenian. As he spoke, Isakhanyan was changing a flat tire on his car in Kornidzor, an Armenian border town where he and his wife had fled with no hope of returning to their homeland.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Russians lied to us and tricked us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told us the peacekeepers would be there and that there would be no more war. Then, at night, they started shelling with artillery and Grads and drones,\u201d he said, referring to Azerbaijani forces.</p>\n\n<p>For the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, there is also anger at being ignored by the world. For most of the last 10 months, Azerbaijan blocked the Lachin Corridor, causing food shortages.</p>\n\n<p>Artur Babayan, 26, of Martakert, blamed Russian leaders. \u201cThey either failed to give the right orders or they didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Babayan said. But he was also angry at Armenia\u2019s government, as well as the global community that \u201cwatches and does nothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo governments around the world can provide any safety for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no country in the world who is willing to take actual steps against Turkey and Azerbaijan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The West has never engaged deeply in Armenia\u2019s intractable problems, with the nation perceived as firmly wedded to Moscow. For Armenia, an isolated, landlocked nation, wedged between two enemies, there appeared to be no realistic partner but Russia.</p>\n\n<p>But when Armenia reached out to others, Moscow threatened repercussions. A decade ago, when Armenia, Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova planned to sign economic agreements with the European Union, the Kremlin saw it as a threat.</p>\n\n<p>In Yerevan, a Russian diplomat warned that Armenia was on a \u201croad to hell.\u201d Another likened the planned accords to pacts with Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Yerevan caved and dropped the deals.</p>\n\n<p>Armenia had long relied on the Russia-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which also includes Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. But as Armenia came under threat in recent months, the organization did nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, Pashinyan has slow-walked cooperation with the CSTO. Earlier this month, Armenia skipped CSTO military exercises in Belarus, but welcomed U.S. forces for a 10-day training exercise in Armenia. It also angered Moscow by sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine in early September.</p>\n\n<p>Even worse, from the Kremlin\u2019s view, was Armenia\u2019s decision to ratify the Rome Statute underpinning the International Criminal Court, which has indicted Putin for alleged war crimes over the deportation of Ukrainian children. Peskov called Armenia\u2019s decision \u201cextremely hostile for us.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In an interview with Italy\u2019s la Repubblica in early September, Pashinyan said that Armenia\u2019s history of relying on Russia was a \u201cstrategic mistake.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Putin\u2019s distaste for Pashinyan is evident in the vehement condemnations by his diplomats and state propagandists.</p>\n\n<p>Pashinyan\u2019s attitude toward Putin is also not subtle. At the same CSTO summit, he moved as far from Putin as possible, leaving an obvious gap in the group photo.</p>\n\n<p>Pashinyan, who helped lead Armenia\u2019s Velvet Revolution protests in 2018 and was twice democratically elected, is not a natural partner for Putin. More relatable is Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, a tough autocrat who broke promises to Western leaders by launching last week\u2019s military operation. Like Putin, Aliyev has a history of brutal rhetoric and inciting hatred of enemies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Armenians believed that Russia would protect their sovereignty,\u201d said Paata Zakareishvili, an expert on the Southern Caucasus and former state minister in Georgia. \u201cBut now it\u2019s complete disappointment. They understand Russia will not protect their interests.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Azerbaijan now occupies small areas within internationally recognized Armenia, in response to which Pashinyan called up a CSTO mission, and the CSTO's response was basically \"damn that's crazy\".\n\nSo there are serious questions whether Russia is **actually** guaranteeing Armenia's security anymore.  And if they're not doing that, and they're not defending NK (which they clearly aren't), what exactly relationship do they have with Armenia anymore?\n\nAnd if you want my opinion, I think Pashinyan would love it if it wasn't like that.  His overtures to the west are to signal to Putin that there are limits to how much he's willing to tolerate.  Will it work?  Hard to say, since Putin's not a rational actor.

However, they underestimated Russian resistance, specifically their morale and fighting spirit, believing most Russian units wouldn't stand and fight and would instead break and run. \n\nOverall, Ukraine was expecting to cut the Land Bridge in a very short campaign. But even by the end of June they knew they were very far behind schedule, and were saying as much publicity. And they've barely moved since then, all the talk of recent success and that was for capturing one of the villages they were in front of since June. \n\nThat was entirely due to the Russian defense. Not only was it performed much more competently than the Ukrainians thought, with much more resolve, but they had developed numerous tactics, techniques, and procedures that the Ukrainians still can't overcome, forcing them to largely abandon \"large scale\" mechanized assaults in favor of dispersed small unit dismounted attacks part of a fires centric attrition campaign.\n\nThe Russians had dug the ultimate defense in depth on the Orikhiv axis, about 35 kilometers of layered fixed defenses, with millions of mines, dragons teeth, tank ditches, trenches, concrete forts, etc. But then they elected not to use that defense in depth though, to not use maneuver defense tactics to retreat and pull the UAF deeper into a salient using a series of ambushes at which point they'd launch a major counterattack. That would have cost them ground, potentially permanently, while trying to preserve their own forces while hurting the Ukrainians, trying to get them to overextend. Instead, they pursued a forward defense, to hold the front line at all costs, to not retreat unless pushed out, and even then still counterattacking. That was VERY unexpected. \n\nWhile that choice has definitely caused much higher losses to the Russians, it's also why Ukrainian forces have only advanced about 12 kilometers from the start of the offensive, with 80 kilometers still to reach the Sea of Azov. \n\nAn educated guess is that the Russians chose to do that as part of an exhaustion strategy aimed at hurting UA and Western morale, showcasing the lack of ground liberated as a failure of offensive capabilities, hoping to sway them to end the war maybe. Like all strategy framed on enemy morale, it's fraught with error and unlikely to work because it's all based on underestimating enemy resolve. \n\nNow the Ukrainians have revised their offensive goals, the UAF operational commander of the offensive has said the minimalist goal is to reach Tokmak, at which point they can say it was a success then (about 20 kilometers). Plus, they have made numerous statements suggesting they don't intend to stop the offensive anytime soon, going into the wet season, the winter, and then spring maybe too. \n\nI'd recommend listening to Russian military expert Michael Kofman on [this podcast](https://warontherocks.com/category/podcasts/war-on-the-rocks/).",

Plus, they have made numerous statements suggesting they don&#39;t intend to stop the offensive anytime soon, going into the wet season, the winter, and then spring maybe too. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d recommend listening to Russian military expert Michael Kofman on <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/category/podcasts/war-on-the-rocks/\">this podcast</a>.</p>\n</div>",

I agree with you that nobody was preparing for a war like this, including the Russian MIC which is very dependent on Western technology for its latest weaponry.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Frankly, we didn&#39;t even see what the Russians were even capable of in Ukraine, they were totally hamstrung by one of the worst invasion plans in the history of modern warfare that totally broke their entire ground forces with losses they couldn&#39;t recover from because they immediately went on the offensive again without time to recover. Then did a bunch of other really really stupid things afterwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It looks like you are agreeing that the Russian military is performing terribly compared to how it was supposed to on paper.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>NATO planners didn&#39;t include that as a contingency plan for the invasion of NATO countries because it&#39;s absurd, there is no way in hell the Russians would have made an intelligence assessment that bad invading the Baltics/Poland, they would have had no reason to think an FSB run campaign to undermine NATO would have worked, or Pro-Russian populations in NATO would welcome them, which is why they underestimated Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given the nearly complete lack of preparation for the current war, NATO planners thought that an invasion of Ukraine was absurd as well.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the most important aspect of this war is the lack of air dominance on either side. I don&#39;t think that Russia would have had an answer for U.S. air dominance which would have led to a lopsided NATO victory. In addition to air power, we are still not seeing some of the latest Western ground weaponry - the first ones that come to my mind that could potentially be very influential, given how this war is being fought, are longer range indirect fires, armor APS, NLOS loitering munitions.</p>\n</div>",

Then it needs to be almost exactly the same video, which is very easy to spot.</p>\n\n<p>This is the same level of criticism that we see from pro-Russians when they criticise Oryx, but can&#39;t provide any examples of bad data.</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "NikkoJT has the right answer, but to put it even simpler an IFF is just an automatic radio transmission. IFF aggressive platforms will send out a message that basically says 'who are you,' and then they will get in return a response that says 'I am a Chinese warship.' The missile then will (hopefully) decide not to attack that target and move on to one with a more ambiguous response. \n\nOf course its not that easy. The exact parameters of each system will be classified, for the exact reasons youre asking about. First, the broadcasting message will be on a specific frequency which will be classified and may be changed right before the beginning of hostilities. Second, the sending message will be coded so who even knows what the query is. Third, the response will also be in code, so who knows what the proper reply is. Very likely the call and response isn't in plain text, but is rather more like a very sophisticated alphanumeric key. So its far more difficult than just saturating the UNIX version of 'I am a Chinese warship' on every channel during an invasion. Then the parameters of the transmission may also be a security factor. The missile may reject responses which occur out of a planned window. So if it takes you a second to spin up the correct response, you may not get it in time. This is all to say, these kinds of systems are VERY VERY tightly managed to prevent the exact kind of shenanigans youre thinking about.\n\nThe real solution to IFF is twofold. First, you classify any IFF broadcast hostile in a specific area and (where possible) destroy broadcasting platforms without interest in what is being sent. Second, IFF is still a radio signal and can be defeated by the application of broad spectrum jamming. Ironically, if you figure out what channel IFF is being broadcast on you *might* jam it by saturating that channel with 'I am a Chinese warship,' in UNIX at very high intensity. Of course the IFF system will also theoretically be resistant to broad spectrum jamming attempts. \n\nBut this is one of those cyberwarfare things the Pentagon is crazy about, in both an offensive and defensive capacity. Lot of work has been going into either penetrating or hardening IFF systems, among many others.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NikkoJT has the right answer, but to put it even simpler an IFF is just an automatic radio transmission. IFF aggressive platforms will send out a message that basically says &#39;who are you,&#39; and then they will get in return a response that says &#39;I am a Chinese warship.&#39; The missile then will (hopefully) decide not to attack that target and move on to one with a more ambiguous response. </p>\n\n<p>Of course its not that easy. The exact parameters of each system will be classified, for the exact reasons youre asking about. First, the broadcasting message will be on a specific frequency which will be classified and may be changed right before the beginning of hostilities. Second, the sending message will be coded so who even knows what the query is. Third, the response will also be in code, so who knows what the proper reply is. Very likely the call and response isn&#39;t in plain text, but is rather more like a very sophisticated alphanumeric key. So its far more difficult than just saturating the UNIX version of &#39;I am a Chinese warship&#39; on every channel during an invasion. Then the parameters of the transmission may also be a security factor. The missile may reject responses which occur out of a planned window. So if it takes you a second to spin up the correct response, you may not get it in time. This is all to say, these kinds of systems are VERY VERY tightly managed to prevent the exact kind of shenanigans youre thinking about.</p>\n\n<p>The real solution to IFF is twofold. First, you classify any IFF broadcast hostile in a specific area and (where possible) destroy broadcasting platforms without interest in what is being sent. Second, IFF is still a radio signal and can be defeated by the application of broad spectrum jamming. Ironically, if you figure out what channel IFF is being broadcast on you <em>might</em> jam it by saturating that channel with &#39;I am a Chinese warship,&#39; in UNIX at very high intensity. Of course the IFF system will also theoretically be resistant to broad spectrum jamming attempts. </p>\n\n<p>But this is one of those cyberwarfare things the Pentagon is crazy about, in both an offensive and defensive capacity. Lot of work has been going into either penetrating or hardening IFF systems, among many others.</p>\n</div>",
