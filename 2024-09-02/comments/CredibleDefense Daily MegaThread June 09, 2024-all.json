        "body": "Over the last days Ukrainska Pravda published a couple of very interesting interviews, in Ukrainian. I will make a summary highlighting the most interesting points - who wants to, can read the full original versions. By the way, tomorrow DeepState should publish the account regarding the events of April 11 and the following days on the Ocheretyne breakthrough and the problems occurred with the 115th Mechanized Brigade.\n\nIn the [first](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2024/06/6/7459381/) interview, we are with Taras Mykhalchuk, a 56-year-old Major of the 65th Mechanized Brigade. He's a Russian-born, ethnic Russian who grew up in Ternopil. At the age of 18, he joined the Soviet Army and served in the 22nd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, first in Afghanistan and later in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh. After that he served as an officer in the Ukrainian Army. In 2005 he moved to Spain, where he worked as an engineer and built up a family. At the outbreak of what Ukrainians now commonly call the \"Great War\", he quit his job and volunteered for the UAF, out of love for the country he grew up in and served, in the latter part of his previous military career. \n\nAs soon as he arrived, he started serving as an officer (in view of his past experience), and was sent to the 65th Mechanized Brigade, which was being created at the time - becoming a deputy battalion commander. This is a very peculiar brigade, in the sense that unlike the very vast majority of the other Ukrainian brigades, it never moved from its initial sector: Zaporizhia Oblast (specifically, the area between Kamyanske and Orikhiv). \n\nSince its creation, its task has been to hold the front line in that area, carrying out some attacks (as we shall see later). In June 2023, it found itself involved in the main axis of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, in which it actively participated, remaining in the Orikhiv sector even in the following months; it still defends the area around Robotyne. As the \"Spaniard\" (his call sign) specifies, the 65th Brigade is not a unit specialized in assault, but simple motorized infantry, specialized in holding positions conquered by others. \n\nIn the summer of 2023, he received the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky from Zelensky; in February of this year, he was wounded by a shrapnel during a combat mission and had his gallbladder removed. Mykhalchuk states that most of Robotyne is a grey area at the moment and has not been captured entirely by the Russians (the interview was made during the second half of May). The village has completely disappeared: there are only ruins. The Ukrainian defenders are in the trenches near the village. He blames the loss of the village on the shells shortage. He heavily criticizes the overly optimistic attitude still prevalent in various Ukrainian media, as a result of which people don't understand the need to defend their nation, and as a consequence there is a lack of replacements in the front line for those who became a casualty or are simply exhausted, like many soldiers after more than two years of war.\n\nAccording to him, the shells shortage (he speaks for mortars, which is the thing he has control over, being available at the battalion level) was a constant condition throughout the war, with the Russians having a 10/15/20-fold advantage. Lately this imbalance has been improving as slightly more rounds are being supplied, whereas the Russians seem to have less availability than in the past (this is a rumour I have heard on some Russian channels - it's said that there has been a substantial slowdown in shipments from North Korea and Iran, we will see if this will be confirmed). Now the 120mm mortar of his battalion can fire 10 to 20 rounds per day (I remember that during the winter 5 rounds per mortar was something really common for the Ukrainians), although the situation is not at all satisfactory in order to cope with the constant Russian assaults, which can still afford to fire up to 100 rounds per day per mortar. It's also said that the 120mm mortar is accurate and effective, while the 82mm mortar is less accurate and is only effective when used in larger numbers (i.e. a handful of mortars at once) against concentrations of enemy infantry. It's stated that FPV drones are helping the Ukrainians a lot at the moment, although the Russians in turn make extensive use of them. \n\nThere is then an account of the counteroffensive, started mostly by the 47th Mechanized Brigade with the support of the 65th Brigade. Mykhalchuk states that there was simply a huge number of trenches, ditches, dragon's teeth, pillboxes, and especially mines, and that's just before the actual Surovikin line. In each Russian trench there were 4-5 ATGMs (which they also used against infantry). The very high density of minefields and trenches created an effect of continuous echeloned defense lines. The tanks could only go forwards or backwards along the cleared path: turning right or left would have meant hitting a mine. \n\nFor him, attacking with armored vehicles was destined to be a failure, and to the last he did not believe that the main direction of the offensive would be there, but that it would only be a diversionary action, giving the example of the 65th Brigade's attack against Nesteryanka (a dozen kms to the west of Robotyne) in mid September 2022: only one of the fifteen M113s wasn't damaged or destroyed by mines and the unit had major human losses. This negative experience taught Mykhalchuk that, at least in that sector, it was just not possible to use armored vehicles, which the 65th Brigade prefers to keep in the rear. In contrast, the 47th Brigade's initial attacks were exclusively armored/mechanized, with no foot infantry. \n\nIt's said that in the months before the counteroffensive, the men of the 65th Brigade could clearly see lights in the Russian positions at night: they were working to build or improve their positions. But the Ukrainians could not hit them due to the shells shortage (and I might add, FPV drones with thermal cameras were not at all widespread at the time).\n\nBefore the counteroffensive Mykhalchuk was summoned by the colonels and generals who were planning the operation, in order to brief them about the situation in the sector. He was honest about everything he knew: about the status of the Russian defences and the shortcomings on the Ukrainian side, but was basically ignored by the senior officers. The order to attack was given by the then commander of the Operational-Strategic Group \"Tavria\", Tarnavsky. Mykhalchuk claims to have only understood \"Forward, forward!\" from him (which is what the Ukrainians call the attitude of Red Army-style officers interested only in advancing regardless of any issues and of the losses). \n\nThe \"Spaniard\" goes on to say that a very important target in the initial phase of the counter-offensive was \"X\", a hill along the road to Robotyne. I enquired on this position - it should be Hill 138, more than 1 km to the north of the first houses of Robotyne. The battle for this position was very long: it began in the second half of June; the Ukrainians came very close to it in early July, it continued throughout that month and ended in early August. According to him, the 47th Brigade was unable to conquer this position, which was taken by the infantrymen of the 65th Brigade. He then argues that it was better not to attack it directly but to flank it, and he would have preferred that his battalion had been allowed to do this. Here I take the opportunity to say that I always recommend applying a light veil of scepticism to certain statements and not always taking them as 100% true - I have read many interviews with Ukrainian soldiers and when there is something that has gone wrong, it's very often the fault of other brigades; when it's clear that the problems are internal to the brigade, it's the fault of other battalions, then of other companies... I write this because soldiers of the 47th Brigade never spared criticism on the management of the other brigades involved in the counteroffensive.\n\nDuring the summer, in one day, the Russians fired 400 shells against the positions captured and held by soldiers of the 65th Brigade. There were no fatalities, but 22 servicemen got wounded, some seriously, including the battalion commander, who was replaced in his role by Mykhalchuk. \n\nThe Russian tactics against the mechanized attacks of the 47th Brigade (which happened at night) were as follows: ATGM fire against the first vehicle that was advancing towards the heights, after which the artillery began to work heavily against the vehicles behind. The first Russian soldiers the Ukrainians met at the beginning of the counteroffensive were skilled: there was the 22nd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade... i.e. Mykhalchuk's old unit (he lost all his former contact in this unit after 2014). From the top of \"X\", the Spetsnaz destroyed several M113s and YPR-765s of the 65th Brigade with ATGMs. As also mentioned in the past by other soldiers, they too had been said by the higher-ups that the Russians would run away with the sight of the first Leopards. For the interviewee, the only attacks that can be and have actually been successful are infantry attacks, made by soldiers who know the terrain well, at most aided by a few armored vehicles in a support role. He says that he and his men before the attacks walked kilometers and kilometers on foot, through trenches and forest belts (\"like partisans\"). Second part below.",

            "body": "In any case, after conquering \"X\", the 65th Brigade had lost its offensive capability and was moved to the Kopani area (further west), to cover the front there and avoid Russian counterattacks in that area. Reportedly, during the assaults, the men under Mykhalchuk had few casualties, which, however, increased when they had to defend the newly conquered and unconsolidated positions, which were heavily hit by Russian artillery.\n\nThe difficulties during the active phases of the counteroffensive and the psychological setbacks (reportedly related in particular to mines) caused some of the troops to refuse the assault tasks, making up medical conditions, and succeeding in avoiding their duties due to the corruption that Mykhalchuk denounces, saying that the UAF is greatly damaged by it, as well as by senior officers without any common sense and attachment to the reality, and by refuseniks. \n\nThere were also serious problems with intelligence. Mykhalchuk mentions the 3:1 ratio as the needed superiority to win an attack. In fact, he and 12 other men once managed to defend a position that was being attacked by 40 Russians. After that, the same 13 Ukrainians were ordered to attack a Russian trench, being told there was no one there. Their drones carried out a reconnaissance in the area and saw that there were in fact 70 Russians there. Problems with intelligence at the local level are still a widespread problem that can potentially lead to serious consequences (and it often does, there have also been recent examples that I will not report).\n\nIn the conclusion Mykhalchuk also criticises the fact that awards (which don't carry any monetary prize) only came after the counteroffensive began, while the 65th Brigade's previous efforts (including the attack against Nesteryanka in September 2022) were essentially ignored. From late 2022 until the beginning of the counteroffensive, only Bakhmut was mentioned, with the result that some units that arrived in Zaporizhzhia Oblast after fighting in the Bakhmut sector felt as if they were on holiday (I believe he refers to the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade and to the 46th Airmobile Brigade). \n\nThe article concludes on a positive note - Mykhalchuk confirms that new strong points and fortifications have been built and are being built in the Orikhiv sector, and in this sense the defense of the Robotyne salient by the Ukrainians over the recent months has bought time for these works - but also with Mykhalchuk's criticism of the system, both the current and particularly the pre-war one, which saw UAF officers living in poverty due to low salaries. Mykhalchuk is going back to Spain after the war. Finally, he says that his Afghan experience taught him that a small (in size) but determined people can win against a big army. \n\nThe [second](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2024/06/5/7459033/) interview is with Dmytro Balabukha, a 34-year tank officer, veteran of the ATO. When the \"Great War\" began, he was detained in a penal colony in Chernihiv Oblast for a murder committed a few years earlier. He and another detainee, because of their military experience, were released and joined the UAF. Until now, Balabukha was the commander of a tank company of the 32nd Mechanized Brigade, a brigade created in the beginning of 2023 that fought, and fights, in the Svatove sector and later in Kupyansk. Now Balabukha is being transferred to a new role: commander of a very recently created assault company, which is going to be manned by convicts who are volunteering after the specific law passed last month. \n\nFirst of all, he says that the 32nd Brigade was given T-64BVs, which Balabukha was already familiar with since 2014, when he went to the front as a volunteer. For him, Soviet tanks don't have much to envy to Western tanks, except for speed - actually a very important factor. The \"Kontakt\" dynamic protection largely makes up for the armour disadvantage of the Soviet tanks, providing additional protection, and the Western tanks also have an extra man in the crew. Balabukha says he has lost a few colleagues in the past, and usually the most dangerous role in a tank crew is that of the driver. At the same time, age is not a discriminating factor: he says that some young men are not up to the responsibilities of a tank driver and leave his unit, while some older folks really do their best despite their age (I would add - the average age of Ukrainian tank drivers is usually high, as it's a role that does not require high physical prowess, and in addition, there are a lot of men who have experience as tank crewmen from their military service in the late Soviet Army). The tank he would prefer to drive is a modernized T-80, which has the same advantages as the T-64 but with more speed - he would also appreciate the Leopard 2A6, although he doesn't think it is better than a modernized T-80 or a T-84 (just stating his opinions). \n\nFor Balabukha, the skills of Russian tankers have increased a lot compared to the beginning of the war, but Ukrainian tankers are also able to use new innovative tactics that surprise the Russians. For him, the main purpose of the tanks is to provide infantry support and destroy enemy positions with direct fire, so that the infantry can occupy them. Balabukha says that he has always seen the Russians fighting with newer or modernized tanks (it must be remembered that, as part of the 32nd Mech Brigade, he almost always fought against units of the 1st GTA, which are better equipped than other formations). But he also says that when used against infantry, even a very old tank can be fearsome and successful. Balabukha says that only those who are not at war laugh at enemy equipment. At the same time, Balabukha feels more comfortable in the army than in his old boring and repetitive job (accountant). \n\nHe says it's not easy for tankers to shake off their fear before going into action, but at the same time he feels more protected in there than anywhere else when 120mm mortar rounds start raining down. FPV drones are a problem, but the issue is being quite successfully addressed by EW systems. He's against using metal grates as the Russians do and also criticizes the \"turtle-tank\", which he describes as useful for APCs but not for tanks, which have to rotate the turret to be effective. \n\nHe later clarifies the events of the beginning of the invasion. In fact, apart from the two of them, the other ATO participants were also to be released from jail, but there was no time: the Russians had already reached the penal colony and so the two of them had to escape behind their lines, joining some partisans from the village where the colony is located. During this time they took part in guerrilla actions against the Russians, burning their artillery and Grads. He later joined the \"Ticks\" unit, before returning to his old job as a tank officer in the then-new 32nd Brigade.\n\nAs part of his new fresh role, Balabukha visited a penal colony to talk to the convicts. He says he's optimistic that greater numbers of volunteers will be reached compared to the estimates of the Ministry of Justice (around 4500 volunteers). According to him the motivation of the convicts is very high, and well above that of a part of the newly mobilized men. He told the convicts that they are going to be stormtroopers, a very risky role, and in response they said they accept the risks and only want to be taught their new job. \n\nDespite the difficulties, Balabukha believes in victory, but says it's conditional on the arrival of aid from partner countries and on its actual amount. He says he is confident about the capabilities of the incoming F-16s, provided there are enough missiles and bombs.",

Problems with intelligence at the local level are still a widespread problem that can potentially lead to serious consequences (and it often does, there have also been recent examples that I will not report).</p>\n\n<p>In the conclusion Mykhalchuk also criticises the fact that awards (which don&#39;t carry any monetary prize) only came after the counteroffensive began, while the 65th Brigade&#39;s previous efforts (including the attack against Nesteryanka in September 2022) were essentially ignored. From late 2022 until the beginning of the counteroffensive, only Bakhmut was mentioned, with the result that some units that arrived in Zaporizhzhia Oblast after fighting in the Bakhmut sector felt as if they were on holiday (I believe he refers to the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade and to the 46th Airmobile Brigade). </p>\n\n<p>The article concludes on a positive note - Mykhalchuk confirms that new strong points and fortifications have been built and are being built in the Orikhiv sector, and in this sense the defense of the Robotyne salient by the Ukrainians over the recent months has bought time for these works - but also with Mykhalchuk&#39;s criticism of the system, both the current and particularly the pre-war one, which saw UAF officers living in poverty due to low salaries. Mykhalchuk is going back to Spain after the war. Finally, he says that his Afghan experience taught him that a small (in size) but determined people can win against a big army. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2024/06/5/7459033/\">second</a> interview is with Dmytro Balabukha, a 34-year tank officer, veteran of the ATO. When the &quot;Great War&quot; began, he was detained in a penal colony in Chernihiv Oblast for a murder committed a few years earlier. He and another detainee, because of their military experience, were released and joined the UAF. Until now, Balabukha was the commander of a tank company of the 32nd Mechanized Brigade, a brigade created in the beginning of 2023 that fought, and fights, in the Svatove sector and later in Kupyansk. Now Balabukha is being transferred to a new role: commander of a very recently created assault company, which is going to be manned by convicts who are volunteering after the specific law passed last month. </p>\n\n<p>First of all, he says that the 32nd Brigade was given T-64BVs, which Balabukha was already familiar with since 2014, when he went to the front as a volunteer. For him, Soviet tanks don&#39;t have much to envy to Western tanks, except for speed - actually a very important factor. The &quot;Kontakt&quot; dynamic protection largely makes up for the armour disadvantage of the Soviet tanks, providing additional protection, and the Western tanks also have an extra man in the crew. Balabukha says he has lost a few colleagues in the past, and usually the most dangerous role in a tank crew is that of the driver. At the same time, age is not a discriminating factor: he says that some young men are not up to the responsibilities of a tank driver and leave his unit, while some older folks really do their best despite their age (I would add - the average age of Ukrainian tank drivers is usually high, as it&#39;s a role that does not require high physical prowess, and in addition, there are a lot of men who have experience as tank crewmen from their military service in the late Soviet Army). The tank he would prefer to drive is a modernized T-80, which has the same advantages as the T-64 but with more speed - he would also appreciate the Leopard 2A6, although he doesn&#39;t think it is better than a modernized T-80 or a T-84 (just stating his opinions). </p>\n\n<p>For Balabukha, the skills of Russian tankers have increased a lot compared to the beginning of the war, but Ukrainian tankers are also able to use new innovative tactics that surprise the Russians. For him, the main purpose of the tanks is to provide infantry support and destroy enemy positions with direct fire, so that the infantry can occupy them. Balabukha says that he has always seen the Russians fighting with newer or modernized tanks (it must be remembered that, as part of the 32nd Mech Brigade, he almost always fought against units of the 1st GTA, which are better equipped than other formations). But he also says that when used against infantry, even a very old tank can be fearsome and successful. Balabukha says that only those who are not at war laugh at enemy equipment. At the same time, Balabukha feels more comfortable in the army than in his old boring and repetitive job (accountant). </p>\n\n<p>He says it&#39;s not easy for tankers to shake off their fear before going into action, but at the same time he feels more protected in there than anywhere else when 120mm mortar rounds start raining down. FPV drones are a problem, but the issue is being quite successfully addressed by EW systems. He&#39;s against using metal grates as the Russians do and also criticizes the &quot;turtle-tank&quot;, which he describes as useful for APCs but not for tanks, which have to rotate the turret to be effective. </p>\n\n<p>He later clarifies the events of the beginning of the invasion. In fact, apart from the two of them, the other ATO participants were also to be released from jail, but there was no time: the Russians had already reached the penal colony and so the two of them had to escape behind their lines, joining some partisans from the village where the colony is located. During this time they took part in guerrilla actions against the Russians, burning their artillery and Grads. He later joined the &quot;Ticks&quot; unit, before returning to his old job as a tank officer in the then-new 32nd Brigade.</p>\n\n<p>As part of his new fresh role, Balabukha visited a penal colony to talk to the convicts. He says he&#39;s optimistic that greater numbers of volunteers will be reached compared to the estimates of the Ministry of Justice (around 4500 volunteers). According to him the motivation of the convicts is very high, and well above that of a part of the newly mobilized men. He told the convicts that they are going to be stormtroopers, a very risky role, and in response they said they accept the risks and only want to be taught their new job. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the difficulties, Balabukha believes in victory, but says it&#39;s conditional on the arrival of aid from partner countries and on its actual amount. He says he is confident about the capabilities of the incoming F-16s, provided there are enough missiles and bombs.</p>\n</div>",

But less about the tactics of employment.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the footage is about 6 months old, though.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKmPUj4r9gM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKmPUj4r9gM</a></p>\n\n<p>They talk a lot about different types of droppable munitions, their effects, converting them for dropability and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>3:45 - unpacking crates of grenades</p>\n\n<p>5:50 - camera pans over converted munitions, followed by discussion of them</p>\n\n<p>9:12 - western M67 grenades tend to require more modification for drone drops due to the number of safety mechanisms that have to be worked around.  soviet F1 grenades, not so many, and creates more shrapnel</p>\n\n<p>12:54 - workshop for making munitons shown, and dicussion of some of the detonation mechanisms.  subtitles about how many builders have died in accidents</p>\n\n<p>14:58 - assembling one of the big drones, for carrying a tandem RPG round, the best kind for attacking tanks.  subtitles about how many veteran amputees now work in manufacturing drones and munitions.</p>\n\n<p>16:05 - a fully assembled, specialized team for FPV production can produce about 30 a day</p>\n\n<p>16:45 - shots of a 3D printer lab making fins</p>\n\n<p>17:00 - minelayer and supply delivery ground-based drones.  some complaining about how some Canadians came to Ukraine under the guise of helping, took some idea, went back and tried to patent them in Western countries and then try to sell them back to Ukraine for 12,000 apiece</p>\n\n<p>18:30 - repairing damaged DJI Mavic / Matrix drones. discussion about how techniques often get exchanged when brigades come into the repair facilities</p>\n\n<p>20:50 - repair is important, there are probably 100,000+ imported DJI drones in broken condition at any given time that can be restored to service if components are available - but they aren&#39;t always available.  $3000 spent on a new drone could repair 15-20 broken drones.  </p>\n\n<p>22:00 - DJI remote control antennae modifications</p>\n\n<p>23:20 - more footage of drone repair workshop</p>\n\n<p>25:20 - donating to drone repair facilities is a high-impact way to contribute.  buying drones new is not only expensive but it takes weeks, especially due to all the modifications that are needed before it can be put into service (anonymization, replacing the radios with more powerful ones that can use different frequencies, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>30:30 - they also modify drones to carry more weight, or less weight (to go further), or other modifications depending on the needs of the area of operations</p>\n\n<p>31:50 - more discussion about how drone repair is less &quot;tangible&quot; (harder to raise money for) but more impactful than buying new drones, and the difficulties caused by the degree to which social media fundraising funds the war.  Lots of critical functions aren&#39;t sexy enough to raise money off of.</p>\n</div>",

The right wing parties were removed from all decision making regarding the war. This cannot remain so now, and already Ben Gvir is demanding a place in the war cabinet.\n\n>does this make a ceasefire even less likely?\n\nI'd say the likelihood remains the same, which is extremely low.

Gallant was fired in March last year and reinstated as a result of mass protests. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>so is there any room for Gantz&#39;s departure to cause future Cabinet shake-ups?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, like I said when Gantz and Eizencout joined the gov all war decisions were relegated to the small war cabinet, with Gantz being one of the 3 decision makers and Eizencout an observer (that participates in debates). The right wing parties were removed from all decision making regarding the war. This cannot remain so now, and already Ben Gvir is demanding a place in the war cabinet.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>does this make a ceasefire even less likely?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;d say the likelihood remains the same, which is extremely low. Basically it&#39;s a question on whether the US can force Israel to capitulate. Hamas is not going to budge with all international pressure leveled at Israel and none at them.</p>\n</div>",

The showpiece event used to be attended by Western leaders and the heads of big multinationals, but Russia\u2019s ongoing international isolation meant that President Vladimir Putin had to make do with hailing the country\u2019s achievements in front of the presidents of Bolivia and Zimbabwe, plus a delegation from the Taliban. However, Russia\u2019s economy is in good shape and that apparently gave the gathering a certain buzz. \u201cIt felt just like the good old days, when we were friends with everyone and were expecting investors,\u201d one participant told The Bell.\n\n>One of Putin\u2019s favorite talking points \u2013 repeated throughout his appearances at the forum \u2013 is how the Russian economy is actually profiting from sanctions. And there\u2019s some truth in this. Sanctions have isolated the economy from external shocks and, in some ways, that makes it stronger. As a result, we\u2019re seeing a situation in which, despite the war and sanctions, Russia\u2019s economy is booming, with both business and the general public feeling more and more confident. At the end of May, the Central Bank\u2019s business climate indicator hit a new 12-year high. And in the first quarter of this year, we saw record levels of investment activity among domestic businesses.\n\n>In the first three months of this year, Russian GDP grew as much as 5.4%. That\u2019s even more than the previous three months. Figures for April are more modest, but indicate continued economic growth in terms of household consumption and investment activity. This economic performance is driven by three main reasons:\n\n**The exodus of foreign companies and demand for import substitution**\n\n>According to the Kyiv School of Economics, more than 1,600 transnational companies either left Russia or suspended operations following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, only 666 of these are truly gone (liquidated or sold). It was the servicing and manufacturing sector that bore the brunt of the exodus. The automotive industry suffered the greatest damage, followed by suppliers of consumer, industrial and investment goods and services. Finance, insurance, science and technology, auto repair and trade also took significant hits.\n\n>However, the exodus also opened up opportunities for Russian companies. Thus, in the first three months of this year, profits more than doubled for companies in the finance and insurance sector. Tourism services saw profits up an eye watering 52 times, construction 41 times. In the 12-month period profits have stagnated, though close to their highs. \u201cBusiness taxes are quite low compared with other countries,\u201d the head of one financial service company said in conversation with The Bell. \u201cBoth people and their money are locked inside the country and that is pushing up domestic demand fast. Import substitution opens a lot of niches and I know people who are living very, very well.\u201d\n\n**Increased domestic demand fueled by state spending and credit**\n\n>One of the key drivers of economic growth has been state spending. And additional demand from the state has been transferred to the general public and businesses via state contracts, budget transfers and social handouts. Salaries in March this year went up 21.6% year on year in nominal terms, and 12.9% in real terms.\n\n>Lending growth doubled in the first quarter of this year, despite a double-digit interest rate. Retail loans were up 3.7% compared with the previous quarter and auto finance is growing: the average loan to buy a vehicle went up from 1.2 million rubles to 1.4 million rubles last year. This is in line with increased prices at dealerships: Russian cars rose 24% in price over the course of the year, while foreign-made ones increased 11%. In addition, we\u2019re seeing a new class of borrowers: people with high incomes prefer to generate interest on savings (encouraged by rates of over 17%) while using cheaper credit to cover current expenditure. \u201cPeople who had poor credit ratings are suddenly creditworthy and are starting to take out bigger loans, even though interest rates are really high,\u201d German Gref, head of state-owned Sber, Russia\u2019s biggest bank, said in a speech earlier this month. \n\n>Corporate borrowing also keeps growing (up 1.9% in April and 1.8% the month before), according to the Central Bank, with developers borrowing to fund housing construction projects, while transport and IT firms also leading the way.\n\n**Businesses are effectively unable to transfer funds out of Russia**\n\n>Difficulty moving money in and out of Russia is both a result of Western sanctions, and restrictions imposed by Moscow. But the isolation of Russia\u2019s banking system, the enforcement in the West of strict compliance requirements on funds originating in Russia, freezing accounts, and other wartime issues are forcing high net worth individuals to find ways of \u201cparking\u201d their money in Russia.\n\n>By the end of 2023, the number of Russians with capital over 100 million rubles was up 50%. Their total capital showed a record growth of 62%, according to the Frank RG consultancy.\n\n>These high net worth individuals (HNWI) account for about 23% of Russia\u2019s total financial capital. \u201cThe most significant driver of the growth of HNWI\u2019s financial capital in Russia was an influx of \u201cnew money\u201d which is mainly due to a reduction in capital outflow,\u201d said Lyubov Prokopova, project director at Premium & Private Banking Frank RG. \n\n>Cross-border transfers in 2023 were down 35% year-on-year to 2.9 trillion rubles, according to the Central Bank. This is a turnaround from the first year of the war in Ukraine when the capital held by wealthy Russians tumbled more than 20% to 10.9 trillion rubles. This was caused by capital flight, a stock-market collapse and the withdrawal of capital into illiquid forms (gold, property and businesses). However, restrictions on Russian money steadily increased: international transfer fees went up; private funds faced stricter compliance; and some European Union banks refused to work with any Russians. This all contributes to Russian money staying \u201cat home\u201d and, ultimately, going to work within the Russian economy.\n\n\n>As we\u2019ve seen, both state and private demand are helping turbo-charge Russia\u2019s militarized economy and fueling business optimism. A weakening of Western financial sanctions would encourage capital flight and weaken the Kremlin's war machine. However, the situation also has political consequences: the war in Ukraine is becoming associated in the minds of many with a time of economic opportunity and increased profits \u2013 not with sanctions, repression or violence.\n\nFrom the BBC a few days ago aswell:\n\n**Russia's economy is growing, but can it last?**\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nn7pej9jyo",

There's something strange going on there. It certainly feels like a case of storing up problems for the future, if that credit starts to dry up or interest rates on credit rise.\n\nIt's also fascinating how the war & sanctions have functioned like a de facto programme of *edit: I mean to write capital controls* ~~credit control~~ and Import-Substitution-Industrialisation for Russia. Forcing wealthy Russians to keep their more of their money in the country is probably a good thing for the country (even if it the wealthy aren't happy about it). How Russia's industry will respond is a trickier question. It's also something that can be tricky to capture accurately in statistics, if domestically produced alternatives are lower quality.\n\nOf course, this boom is ultimately being driven by government spending on the military, funded by government reserves, borrowing and taxes. That's definitely not something that can continue indefinitely, and in the meantime investment in and development of the civilian economy is squeezed out. As a quote in the BBC article says:\n\n>\u201cLonger term, you are destroying the economy,\u201d believes Chris Weafer, founding partner of Eurasian consultancy firm Macro-Advisory. \u201cThere is no money going into future development.\u201d",

It certainly feels like a case of storing up problems for the future, if that credit starts to dry up or interest rates on credit rise.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also fascinating how the war &amp; sanctions have functioned like a de facto programme of <em>edit: I mean to write capital controls</em> <del>credit control</del> and Import-Substitution-Industrialisation for Russia. Forcing wealthy Russians to keep their more of their money in the country is probably a good thing for the country (even if it the wealthy aren&#39;t happy about it). How Russia&#39;s industry will respond is a trickier question. It&#39;s also something that can be tricky to capture accurately in statistics, if domestically produced alternatives are lower quality.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this boom is ultimately being driven by government spending on the military, funded by government reserves, borrowing and taxes. That&#39;s definitely not something that can continue indefinitely, and in the meantime investment in and development of the civilian economy is squeezed out. As a quote in the BBC article says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cLonger term, you are destroying the economy,\u201d believes Chris Weafer, founding partner of Eurasian consultancy firm Macro-Advisory. \u201cThere is no money going into future development.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called Saturday\u2019s events a \u201cmassacre\u201d, while the UN\u2019s aid chief described in graphic detail scenes of \u201cshredded bodies on the ground\u201d.\n\n* At least 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 wounded in Israeli strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday. The Israeli military said its forces had come under heavy fire during the daytime operation.\n\n* The bodies of 109 Palestinians, including 23 children and 11 women, were taken to nearby al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, which also treated more than 100 wounded, a spokesperson, Khalil Degran, told AP. He also said more than 100 people killed in Israeli attacks had been taken to al-Awda hospital. That figure was also given by the Hamas media office, but could not be verified. The Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari confirmed on Saturday that dozens of Palestinians had been killed in the raid. He knew that \u201cunder 100\u201d casualties had been reported, but could not say how many were civilians, he told a briefing.\n\n* The rescue in Nuseirat, a built-up refugee camp dating to the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict, was Israel\u2019s largest such operation of the war, freeing Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40. All four were healthy and were reunited with their families on Saturday after medical tests. At least one wave of heavy airstrikes was launched to secure the passage of the three men, who had been held together. Argamani was rescued alone, from a separate location. The special forces team extracting the male hostages was confronted by militants, Israel\u2019s Channel 12 television reported, and when a rescue vehicle got stuck, called in backup from Israel\u2019s air force and other troops in the area. They escaped under heavy bombardment, the report said. Eyewitnesses also reported tank and drone fire.\n\n* Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the raid \u2013 only the third successful military rescue of the war \u2013 was proof that \u201cIsrael does not surrender to terrorism\u201d. He has long insisted that military pressure is the best way to ensure the return of all Israelis captured on 7 October.\n\n* But beyond Israel, the hostages\u2019 joyful reunions with their families were overshadowed by the horror at the number of people killed during the operation.\nBorrell, in a post on X, condemned \u201cin the strongest terms \u2026 reports from Gaza of another massacre of civilians\u201d. He called for a ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages. \u201cThe bloodbath must end immediately,\u201d he said.\n\n* Gary Epstein, a writer for the Times of Israel, said: \u201cHamas engaged in kidnapping and hostage-taking. Hamas embedded itself in hospitals, schools and United Nations facilities. Hamas uses human shields. Hamas holds hostages in residential neighbourhoods. Where is the outrage? What is Israel supposed to do in these circumstances?\u201d\n\n* The rescue operation may give the prime minister temporary relief at home. After the news broke, his political rival Benny Gantz, a security cabinet member, delayed a speech planned for Saturday evening. He had been widely expected to announce his departure from government, having given Netanyahu an ultimatum to form a long-term plan for Gaza. The prime minister urged him not to step down on Saturday, but in a statement, Gantz\u2019s office said the minister would speak on Sunday evening instead.\n\n* Hostages\u2019 families have been quick to repeat their demands for a ceasefire deal to release their loved ones, saying in a statement on Saturday evening that the military could not bring back all those still held captive.*Israeli forces have now freed seven hostages, but the majority of those who are now home were handed over under a temporary ceasefire deal last November. There are still 120 held in Gaza, at least a third of whom are presumed to have died.\n\n* On Sunday, Hamas\u2019s armed wing posted a video to its Telegram channel showing what appeared to be three unidentifiable corpses with censor bars over their faces, claiming that the bodies belonged to three hostages, including a US citizen, who were killed during the Israeli rescue operation.\n\n* American intelligence was reportedly involved in supporting the Israeli mission. The US president, Joe Biden, welcomed the return of the four hostages, but also said efforts to reach a deal to halt the war and secure the return of everyone held in Gaza would continue.",

They've proven time and time again throughout this war that collateral civilian death is not a real consideration. \n\n>Balancing the probabilities between the chances that the deadliest massacre in the last 245 days occurring at the very moment Hamas most needs to regain the narrative - especially during a traditionally low footprint military operation and the chances that the death toll has been exaggerated to me, right now, leans towards the latter. \n\nThat's basically my takeaway.\n\nIt's possible that the bloodiest single-day op in the war coincides with the largest loss of face Hamas took during the war, given Israel has used loose tactics in the past.\n\nBut it also is pretty convenient, especially when that information comes from the same side that suffered that loss of face, and would like to divert media attention (which it has successfully done).\n\nAlso as far as I'm concerned, we've talked about the principle of proportionality a lot when discussing the Ukraine war and in short it obviously depends a lot on the value of the military target (which in this case clearly exists).  A commander can always be killed later, or not at all, so heavy civilian casualties to kill one can be argued to be disproportionate, easily.  That's how I view it, anyway.\n\nBut these are hostages, civilian hostages that are likely a time-sensitive and very important mission, since Biden's trying to force Israel to accept geopolitical concessions for those hostages.  As such, at least personally, it's hard to think of a more important target.\n\nSo in this case, Hamas can write down whatever number they want.  100, 274, 1000, infinity plus one.  You put them in a civilian home that's actively used by civilians (this is now a confirmed fact).  That civilian home was itself in one of the most populous areas of the city.  Unlike a lot of other Israeli attacks, as far as I'm concerned the number you name is the number **you've** killed.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1db9pa6/daylight_operation_deep_into_gaza_frees_israeli/l7ttflb/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1db9pa6/daylight_operation_deep_into_gaza_frees_israeli/l7ttflb/</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll repost this great thread someone showed me from Nathan Ruser (a guy who&#39;s hardly a friend of the IDF):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Firstly I need to make clear that this isn&#39;t because I think the IDF has any compunction over killing hundreds of civilians as collateral during operations (especially hostage rescue ops). They&#39;ve proven time and time again throughout this war that collateral civilian death is not a real consideration. </p>\n\n<p>Balancing the probabilities between the chances that the deadliest massacre in the last 245 days occurring at the very moment Hamas most needs to regain the narrative - especially during a traditionally low footprint military operation and the chances that the death toll has been exaggerated to me, right now, leans towards the latter. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s basically my takeaway.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s possible that the bloodiest single-day op in the war coincides with the largest loss of face Hamas took during the war, given Israel has used loose tactics in the past.</p>\n\n<p>But it also is pretty convenient, especially when that information comes from the same side that suffered that loss of face, and would like to divert media attention (which it has successfully done).</p>\n\n<p>Also as far as I&#39;m concerned, we&#39;ve talked about the principle of proportionality a lot when discussing the Ukraine war and in short it obviously depends a lot on the value of the military target (which in this case clearly exists).  A commander can always be killed later, or not at all, so heavy civilian casualties to kill one can be argued to be disproportionate, easily.  That&#39;s how I view it, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>But these are hostages, civilian hostages that are likely a time-sensitive and very important mission, since Biden&#39;s trying to force Israel to accept geopolitical concessions for those hostages.  As such, at least personally, it&#39;s hard to think of a more important target.</p>\n\n<p>So in this case, Hamas can write down whatever number they want.  100, 274, 1000, infinity plus one.  You put them in a civilian home that&#39;s actively used by civilians (this is now a confirmed fact).  That civilian home was itself in one of the most populous areas of the city.  Unlike a lot of other Israeli attacks, as far as I&#39;m concerned the number you name is the number <strong>you&#39;ve</strong> killed.</p>\n</div>",
