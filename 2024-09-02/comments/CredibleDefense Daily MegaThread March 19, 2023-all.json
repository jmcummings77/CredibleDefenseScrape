        "body": "Many people on this thread or on Twitter have been arguing that holding out in Bakhmut has caused enormous and unsustainable Ukrainian losses which will compromise their future offensive potential, and/or that Soviet-style leadership is the only reason the Ukrainians have held on to Bakhmut for so long. I disagree with that sentiment but haven't had time to write up a thorough post that doesn't just sound like pure copium. Much like during the Battle of Severodonetsk, I think a lot of people are overreacting to events in the Donbas. Now that I've had a day off to write something up, I have a few hypotheses about the situation and put together some analysis and sources to justify them.\n\n**Dr. Sovietlove; or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Bakhmut**\n\nIn brief:\n\n1. [Ukraine effectively has two armies, one post-Soviet and one NATO](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/03/17/ukraines-army-must-shed-its-soviet-legacy-says-a-military-expert). UAF high commmand has recognized that they have to fight the Russians with an only partially modernized military which includes significant numbers of officers, soldiers, and equipment not suitable for NATO-style warfare. They recognize that you can't [\"beat a large Soviet army with a small one.\"](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2023/02/16/a-year-ago-i-volunteered-as-a-soldier-in-the-ukrainian-army/index.html) They have therefore formulated a strategy to use the post-Soviet and NATO-style units where their particular strengths are most relevant, and are largely resourcing and employing them separately as a result.\n2. The UAF is aggressively applying [economy of force principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_force), which dictate that an army should devote the maximum amount of resources to their primary effort, while allocating the smallest amount possible to any secondary efforts. Thus, [the Ukrainians are committing the fewest possible resources to holding the line of contact in the Donbas while reserving as much as possible for their primary effort, which is the coming counteroffensive](https://www.economist.com/zaluzhny-transcript). \n3. Ukraine along with their allies and soft power proxies such as friendly journalists, whether knowingly or not, have been engaged in a disinformation campaign designed to lure Putin into committing the last of his mobilized reserves to an assault on Bakhmut in the last days of the mud season before the Ukrainian spring counteroffensive.\n\n**Two Armies**\n\n[The post-Soviet army can be characterized by its leadership, organization, and resources.](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/03/17/ukraines-army-must-shed-its-soviet-legacy-says-a-military-expert) \n\n- Leaders tend to be older senior officers trained under Soviet regime pre-2014, although the culture also pervades lower ranks (although that is unsurprising given leadership influence). These officers are often difficult to retrain in the field, tend to punish rather than encourage junior officer initiative, and prefer top-down command-and-control style.\n- These units include many irregular formations, e.g. TDF and National Guard. Of the regular army units in this mold, they tend to be those low on the priority list for upgrades, e.g. motorized brigades that haven't been uparmored to mech brigades yet, and/or ones with the largest proportion of Soviet-derived equipment. \n- Many such units are organized as light infantry, typically either motorized or TD brigades, sometimes airmobile. So not much armor or IFVs, unlike what is seen with the regular army mech brigades. Instead they largely rely on many of the thousands of IMVs and APCs donated by western allies for some amount of armored mobility.\n- Much less training than regular army in some cases. In the first few days of the war, many of these units were literally just the volunteers that showed up and were handed rifles with no questions asked.\n- More conscripts and fewer volunteers being used to provide replacements for these units.\n- Fewer professional military officers. [Hence reports like this one about an officer seeing 100% turnover in his battalion until he was the only professional officer left](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/).\n\nThese units are generally not going to be as useful for offensives, but are certainly capable of holding a fortified defensive line, albeit likely at dreadfully high cost in some cases. Light infantry are surprisingly resilient to artillery fire when dug in properly, and so are an effective check against the (apparently declining) Russian artillery advantage. ATGMs and mines also make it possible for them to resist all but the most carefully coordinated combined arms assaults, which are a vanishingly rare occurence coming from the RuAF. And these units were relatively cheap to equip and quick to train. So they are well-suited for countering the three primary Russian numerical advantages in artillery, armor, and raw manpower, at least while fighting defensively in prepared positions.\n\nOn the other hand, their NATO-style forces are better suited for combined arms maneuver warfare and thus offensives. They emphasize distributed decision making, tactical flexibility, and robust communications between different units and levels of the command. That enables flexible coordination of multiple capabilities on the attack, such that defending against one capability makes defending against the others harder. e.g. suppressing entrenched infantry with artillery while mechanized units traverse open killing ground during an assault in order to bring their tank and IFV guns to bear on those infantry to suppress them after the artillery lets up. [Ukraine is in the process of building out or deploying around 20-28 new brigades of this type](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/11umj9p/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_18_2023/jcpnpw0/). I feel a little bad sourcing to a comment from this megathread rather than a credible third-party source, but /u/offogredux puts together truly excellent summaries of the current structure of Ukrainian forces, so why reinvent the wheel? Plus their information matches what I've seen elsewhere, including [the less consolidated information available here on militaryland](https://militaryland.net/ukraine/). Notably, some units are being built around smaller veteran battalion- or regiment-sized separate units that are upsized to brigades, while others are entirely new formations, but likely include substantial numbers of veteran leaders at all levels. \n\n**Ok, so where is this \"NATO\" army?**\n\n[There are reports of extreme deficits of NATO-trained personnel at the front](https://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/urban-warfare-project/id1490714950?i=1000604624309), which are typically presented as a [sign of Ukrainian weakness](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1630994947783491605) (n.b., see below for more on why to treat any Ukrainian-sourced reports of Ukrainian weakness with a healthy dose of skepticism). Often sources attribute the deficit to high casualty rates among those personnel during the earlier stages of the war. [Best estimates are that the Ukrainians have lost around 120k soldiers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/). [They started the war with around 250k personnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine), of whom perhaps [20k were US-trained veterans](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/27/the-big-battle-is-coming-ukrainian-forces-prepare-for-the-wars-most-intense-phase). Since then, the UK, EU, and US have trained something [like an additional 20k+ soldiers](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3644722-more-than-20000-ukrainian-soldiers-trained-abroad.html) (possibly with some overlap with the other 20k, but likely insignificant numbers if so), with plans to expand training for tens of thousands of additional troops over the next year. So even if every single one of the pre-war NATO-trained personnel are casualties, the total number of NATO-trained personnel in the UAF has at worst remained constant, at best it has doubled, and in any case it will only continue to grow as the western training programs ramp up and the Ukrainians disseminate those skills by assigning NATO-trained personnel to their own training centers. \n\nHowever, the overall *proportion* of NATO-trained personnel in the UAF has almost certainly declined because [mobilization has likely increased the total size of their forces by more than a factor of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization_in_Ukraine), so the overall proprtion declined even if the total number of NATO-trained soldiers actually did double (which is very, very doubtful and the 40k number should be treated as an extremely loose upper bound). That proportion is probably even lower on the front lines if the UAF have allocated those soldiers to new unit formation and units held in reserve for the upcoming offensive. So even if the Ukrainians haven't experienced particularly high casualty rates among such soldiers, we should expect to see far fewer of them on the lines right now. Meaning we can't infer the execess casualty rate from the composition of front line units, as many commentators have, nor do we need a particularly high casualty rate to explain why there are so few of them at the front. Just the formation of so many new brigades must have sucked up all of the available experienced junior officers and NCOs, especially if the UAF are trying to concentrate NATO-trained personnel into specific units. Again that doesn't mean they haven't experienced high casualties, just that the issue probably isn't as bad as some of these articles have made out.\n\nEdit: this post is 1/4 in a thread with the rest in a chain of replies below.

I disagree with that sentiment but haven&#39;t had time to write up a thorough post that doesn&#39;t just sound like pure copium. Much like during the Battle of Severodonetsk, I think a lot of people are overreacting to events in the Donbas.

UAF high commmand has recognized that they have to fight the Russians with an only partially modernized military which includes significant numbers of officers, soldiers, and equipment not suitable for NATO-style warfare. They recognize that you can&#39;t <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2023/02/16/a-year-ago-i-volunteered-as-a-soldier-in-the-ukrainian-army/index.html\">&quot;beat a large Soviet army with a small one.&quot;</a> They have therefore formulated a strategy to use the post-Soviet and NATO-style units where their particular strengths are most relevant, and are largely resourcing and employing them separately as a result.</li>\n<li>The UAF is aggressively applying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_force\">economy of force principles</a>, which dictate that an army should devote the maximum amount of resources to their primary effort, while allocating the smallest amount possible to any secondary efforts. Thus, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/zaluzhny-transcript\">the Ukrainians are committing the fewest possible resources to holding the line of contact in the Donbas while reserving as much as possible for their primary effort, which is the coming counteroffensive</a>. </li>\n<li>Ukraine along with their allies and soft power proxies such as friendly journalists, whether knowingly or not, have been engaged in a disinformation campaign designed to lure Putin into committing the last of his mobilized reserves to an assault on Bakhmut in the last days of the mud season before the Ukrainian spring counteroffensive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Two Armies</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/03/17/ukraines-army-must-shed-its-soviet-legacy-says-a-military-expert\">The post-Soviet army can be characterized by its leadership, organization, and resources.</a> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leaders tend to be older senior officers trained under Soviet regime pre-2014, although the culture also pervades lower ranks (although that is unsurprising given leadership influence). These officers are often difficult to retrain in the field, tend to punish rather than encourage junior officer initiative, and prefer top-down command-and-control style.</li>\n<li>These units include many irregular formations, e.g. TDF and National Guard. Of the regular army units in this mold, they tend to be those low on the priority list for upgrades, e.g. motorized brigades that haven&#39;t been uparmored to mech brigades yet, and/or ones with the largest proportion of Soviet-derived equipment. </li>\n<li>Many such units are organized as light infantry, typically either motorized or TD brigades, sometimes airmobile. So not much armor or IFVs, unlike what is seen with the regular army mech brigades. Instead they largely rely on many of the thousands of IMVs and APCs donated by western allies for some amount of armored mobility.</li>\n<li>Much less training than regular army in some cases. In the first few days of the war, many of these units were literally just the volunteers that showed up and were handed rifles with no questions asked.</li>\n<li>More conscripts and fewer volunteers being used to provide replacements for these units.</li>\n<li>Fewer professional military officers. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/\">Hence reports like this one about an officer seeing 100% turnover in his battalion until he was the only professional officer left</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These units are generally not going to be as useful for offensives, but are certainly capable of holding a fortified defensive line, albeit likely at dreadfully high cost in some cases. Light infantry are surprisingly resilient to artillery fire when dug in properly, and so are an effective check against the (apparently declining) Russian artillery advantage. ATGMs and mines also make it possible for them to resist all but the most carefully coordinated combined arms assaults, which are a vanishingly rare occurence coming from the RuAF.

If you are only visiting the units that are intentionally being staffed with fewer NATO-trained personnel, you shouldn't be surprised to see fewer NATO-trained personnel. Their absence doesn't indicate permanent backsliding across the entire UAF, demonstrate the incompetence of the Ukrainians, nor prove that the Ukrainians have suffered anything near 100% casualties among their NATO-trained NCOs. Instead, it just reflects the relative prioritization of scarce resources by UAF command. [In a recent War on the Rocks podcast episode](https://warontherocks.com/2023/03/how-to-think-about-bakhmut-and-a-ukrainian-spring-offensive/), Kofman specifically pointed out that his visit (and by extension his companions' visits) did not involve any kind of general or systematic survey of the Ukrainian forces, and so any conclusions based on his observations should not be taken to be totally representative of what is happening across the entire UAF right now.\n\n**Cool. Where are the \"Soviet\" units then?**\n\nIt helps to put yourself in Zaluzhny's shoes here. You have two big chunks of your armed forces that operate in very different ways and which are suitable for very different tasks. You are finding it difficult to encourage the newly mobilized senior officers to let go of their Soviet habits, but you also need them because there is no one else who is immediately prepared to lead newly mobilized formations. So you make the obvious, logical decision to use the Soviet-style mobilized commanders how and where you can best make use of them, while hopefully keeping their habits contained and isolated from your more professional units. The best place for those commanders in this war is probably on the defensive in the trenches, where rapid decision-making around complex maneuvers is less often necessary, light infantry can be effective at attriting enemy armored and maneuver forces, individual soldiers don't need as much training to be effective, combined arms operations are less frequent and more easily choreographed, the risk of catastrophic failure is less, and logistics are dramatically simpler than for an offensive force on the move with many vehicles requiring ammo, fuel, and maintenance.\n\nThe allocation of armored assets supports this conclusion. Per Oryx, Ukraine [has received almost exactly the same number of Soviet-derived tanks from their western partners](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html) as [they have lost so far in this war](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html) (488+ donated Soviet-variant tanks versus around 477 lost). Plus captured Russian equipment, they almost certainly have more armor available now than they did at the beginning of the war, not even taking into account the impending introduction of western tanks. Yet there are reports from the front lines that armor is relatively scarce and lightly used. It seems the UAF have combined multiple brigades into ad hoc corps or divisions along stretches of the line of contact (what Jomini calls a \"defensive grouping\") to fill in the gap left by the absence of real formations above brigade size in the Ukrainian ground forces TOE. \n\nThat grouping often consists of several lighter brigades holding the front line backed by a smaller number of more professionalized and/or heavily armored mech or armor brigades as the reserve. [e.g., the UAF defensive grouping around Bakhmut in February, which consisted of two mech brigades backing two TDF brigades, one airmobile brigade, and one marine brigade, all equipped exclusively with Soviet-derived armor and IFVs, along with limited quantities of older western IMVs and APCs like the M113](https://mobile.twitter.com/JominiW/status/1628213057804505091). So light infantry in the trenches, with armor in the rear to plug holes or provide indirect fire support. This approach allows the UAF to allocate the fewest number of regular mechanized and armored army units to the front, freeing up capacity for re-equiping and training for an offensive. It also puts the least amount of strain on their tank and IFV supplies, by making heaviest use of their soon-to-be legacy vehicles, which are also conveniently the ones more Soviet-minded commanders are most familiar with. Hence the relative dearth of armor at the front, even though we should expect more tanks and IFVs than were available at the beginning of the war. The reduced armor commitment comes at the expense of the light infantry in the trenches, who absorb Russian attacks without the benefit of enough tank or IFV support. Further evidence for the idea that lighter forces reliant more on IMVs/APCs form the bulk of forces around Bakhmut includes [the UAF charging Russian lines riding M113s in the vicinty of Bakhmut literally yesterday](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/ukraine-situation-report-armored-personnel-carriers-make-a-charge-in-bakhmut). Which feels a bit like the modern equivalent to the apocryphal story about Polish cavalry charging tanks during WW2, but I guess they have to make do with the tools available.\n\nDoes the presence of Soviet-influenced commanders at the front indicate that the decision to hold Bakhmut was made by such officers blindly applying Soviet doctrine? I would argue probably not. [Syrsky and Zaluzhny have long-established reputations as very much **not** that sort of officer](https://www.economist.com/syrsky-interview), and both have reviewed and [approved the decision to hold in Bakhmut](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-intends-hold-bakhmut-zelenskyy-231200703.html). More importantly, and without relying on an appeal to their authority, there are sufficient strategic and operational justifications to continue the defense there, even if it is on less favorable terms than other defensive efforts across the front. Specifically, attriting Russian reserves to reduce their resistance to an offensive, much like what happened in Kharkiv last August.\n\n**If attriting Russian reserves is the goal, how can these conscript-heavy formations with Soviet-style leadership best do so?**\n\nRight now, [Russia only has a single division held in reserve](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-no-choice-hold-bakhmut-for-now/). That would be [the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division, elements of which have likely been committed to combat already](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-19-2023). This reserve exists to exploit any breakthroughs achieved by assaults on the Ukrainian defenses and to plug any holes in the Russian lines resulting from UAF attacks. If the reserve is depleted before the Ukrainian counter-offensive, the UAF will be able to achieve much more progress much more quickly. Once they breach the Russian lines, there is nothing to stop a penetration into operational depths. Even though [the Russians have fortified extensive fallback positions on secondary lines throughout occupied Ukraine](https://twitter.com/bradyafr/status/1635725244852838400), they need reserves to hold those lines if the front lines are penetrated and the Russian units there are unable to withdraw to secondary positions in good order. Withdrawal under fire is a challenging task and one for which only the VDV has demonstrated any capacity on the Russian side. [There is also no new wave of Russian mobilization yet to provide any further reserves any time in the near future](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/03/15/kremlin-denies-second-mobilization-as-military-offices-clarify-data-of-draft-eligible-men-a80496). Thus, the more Russian reserves the UAF can burn through now, the better their chances on the offensive will be.\n\n[There's been a lot of talk about the loss ratio between the belligerents](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1634907669294112769) and [how that ratio makes a retreat from Bakhmut likely necessary](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1630994947783491605), but ultimately the loss ratio matters less than absolute numbers of Russian reserves attrited. Because the Russians are nearly out of reserves, a UAF attrition strategy may tip them into a full-on rout. If the Ukrainian leaders knew objectively they needed to inflict 1000 more casualties on the Russians to achieve victory, it would be worth losing many times as many Ukrainian soldiers to inflict those casualties. Achieving victory is often worth accepting unfavorable loss ratios, otherwise no one would ever go on the offensive. In any case, the friendly-to-enemy casualty ratios are still almost certainly in Ukraine's favor simply because they are defending, and there have been no serious reports at all that suggest any departure from that norm. So we aren't even talking about the Ukrainians suffering an unfavorable loss ratio at all, just a slightly less favorable one [when compared to real ratios from different areas of the front](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1634907669294112769) or [when compared to hypothesized loss ratios at proposed fallback defensive positions](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1630994947783491605). Rob Lee and DefMon thus both make variations of the same error. They failed to compare the loss ratios around Bakhmut to the expected loss ratios for the offensive, because ultimately the Ukrainians face a choice between attriting the Russian reserves around Bakhmut now, or when they are on the offensive.",

Instead, it just reflects the relative prioritization of scarce resources by UAF command. <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2023/03/how-to-think-about-bakhmut-and-a-ukrainian-spring-offensive/\">In a recent War on the Rocks podcast episode</a>, Kofman specifically pointed out that his visit (and by extension his companions&#39; visits) did not involve any kind of general or systematic survey of the Ukrainian forces, and so any conclusions based on his observations should not be taken to be totally representative of what is happening across the entire UAF right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cool. Where are the &quot;Soviet&quot; units then?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It helps to put yourself in Zaluzhny&#39;s shoes here. You have two big chunks of your armed forces that operate in very different ways and which are suitable for very different tasks. You are finding it difficult to encourage the newly mobilized senior officers to let go of their Soviet habits, but you also need them because there is no one else who is immediately prepared to lead newly mobilized formations. So you make the obvious, logical decision to use the Soviet-style mobilized commanders how and where you can best make use of them, while hopefully keeping their habits contained and isolated from your more professional units. The best place for those commanders in this war is probably on the defensive in the trenches, where rapid decision-making around complex maneuvers is less often necessary, light infantry can be effective at attriting enemy armored and maneuver forces, individual soldiers don&#39;t need as much training to be effective, combined arms operations are less frequent and more easily choreographed, the risk of catastrophic failure is less, and logistics are dramatically simpler than for an offensive force on the move with many vehicles requiring ammo, fuel, and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>The allocation of armored assets supports this conclusion. Per Oryx, Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html\">has received almost exactly the same number of Soviet-derived tanks from their western partners</a> as <a href=\"https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html\">they have lost so far in this war</a> (488+ donated Soviet-variant tanks versus around 477 lost). Plus captured Russian equipment, they almost certainly have more armor available now than they did at the beginning of the war, not even taking into account the impending introduction of western tanks. Yet there are reports from the front lines that armor is relatively scarce and lightly used. It seems the UAF have combined multiple brigades into ad hoc corps or divisions along stretches of the line of contact (what Jomini calls a &quot;defensive grouping&quot;) to fill in the gap left by the absence of real formations above brigade size in the Ukrainian ground forces TOE. </p>\n\n<p>That grouping often consists of several lighter brigades holding the front line backed by a smaller number of more professionalized and/or heavily armored mech or armor brigades as the reserve. <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/JominiW/status/1628213057804505091\">e.g., the UAF defensive grouping around Bakhmut in February, which consisted of two mech brigades backing two TDF brigades, one airmobile brigade, and one marine brigade, all equipped exclusively with Soviet-derived armor and IFVs, along with limited quantities of older western IMVs and APCs like the M113</a>. So light infantry in the trenches, with armor in the rear to plug holes or provide indirect fire support. This approach allows the UAF to allocate the fewest number of regular mechanized and armored army units to the front, freeing up capacity for re-equiping and training for an offensive. It also puts the least amount of strain on their tank and IFV supplies, by making heaviest use of their soon-to-be legacy vehicles, which are also conveniently the ones more Soviet-minded commanders are most familiar with. Hence the relative dearth of armor at the front, even though we should expect more tanks and IFVs than were available at the beginning of the war. The reduced armor commitment comes at the expense of the light infantry in the trenches, who absorb Russian attacks without the benefit of enough tank or IFV support. Further evidence for the idea that lighter forces reliant more on IMVs/APCs form the bulk of forces around Bakhmut includes <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/ukraine-situation-report-armored-personnel-carriers-make-a-charge-in-bakhmut\">the UAF charging Russian lines riding M113s in the vicinty of Bakhmut literally yesterday</a>. Which feels a bit like the modern equivalent to the apocryphal story about Polish cavalry charging tanks during WW2, but I guess they have to make do with the tools available.</p>\n\n<p>Does the presence of Soviet-influenced commanders at the front indicate that the decision to hold Bakhmut was made by such officers blindly applying Soviet doctrine? I would argue probably not. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/syrsky-interview\">Syrsky and Zaluzhny have long-established reputations as very much <strong>not</strong> that sort of officer</a>, and both have reviewed and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-intends-hold-bakhmut-zelenskyy-231200703.html\">approved the decision to hold in Bakhmut</a>. More importantly, and without relying on an appeal to their authority, there are sufficient strategic and operational justifications to continue the defense there, even if it is on less favorable terms than other defensive efforts across the front. Specifically, attriting Russian reserves to reduce their resistance to an offensive, much like what happened in Kharkiv last August.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If attriting Russian reserves is the goal, how can these conscript-heavy formations with Soviet-style leadership best do so?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Right now, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-no-choice-hold-bakhmut-for-now/\">Russia only has a single division held in reserve</a>. That would be <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-19-2023\">the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division, elements of which have likely been committed to combat already</a>. This reserve exists to exploit any breakthroughs achieved by assaults on the Ukrainian defenses and to plug any holes in the Russian lines resulting from UAF attacks. If the reserve is depleted before the Ukrainian counter-offensive, the UAF will be able to achieve much more progress much more quickly. Once they breach the Russian lines, there is nothing to stop a penetration into operational depths. Even though <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bradyafr/status/1635725244852838400\">the Russians have fortified extensive fallback positions on secondary lines throughout occupied Ukraine</a>, they need reserves to hold those lines if the front lines are penetrated and the Russian units there are unable to withdraw to secondary positions in good order. Withdrawal under fire is a challenging task and one for which only the VDV has demonstrated any capacity on the Russian side. <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/03/15/kremlin-denies-second-mobilization-as-military-offices-clarify-data-of-draft-eligible-men-a80496\">There is also no new wave of Russian mobilization yet to provide any further reserves any time in the near future</a>. Thus, the more Russian reserves the UAF can burn through now, the better their chances on the offensive will be.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1634907669294112769\">There&#39;s been a lot of talk about the loss ratio between the belligerents</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1630994947783491605\">how that ratio makes a retreat from Bakhmut likely necessary</a>, but ultimately the loss ratio matters less than absolute numbers of Russian reserves attrited. Because the Russians are nearly out of reserves, a UAF attrition strategy may tip them into a full-on rout. If the Ukrainian leaders knew objectively they needed to inflict 1000 more casualties on the Russians to achieve victory, it would be worth losing many times as many Ukrainian soldiers to inflict those casualties. Achieving victory is often worth accepting unfavorable loss ratios, otherwise no one would ever go on the offensive. In any case, the friendly-to-enemy casualty ratios are still almost certainly in Ukraine&#39;s favor simply because they are defending, and there have been no serious reports at all that suggest any departure from that norm. So we aren&#39;t even talking about the Ukrainians suffering an unfavorable loss ratio at all, just a slightly less favorable one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1634907669294112769\">when compared to real ratios from different areas of the front</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1630994947783491605\">when compared to hypothesized loss ratios at proposed fallback defensive positions</a>. Rob Lee and DefMon thus both make variations of the same error. They failed to compare the loss ratios around Bakhmut to the expected loss ratios for the offensive, because ultimately the Ukrainians face a choice between attriting the Russian reserves around Bakhmut now, or when they are on the offensive.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Why don't the Ukrainians retreat and get an even more favorable ratio in a better position? First, because the Russian offensive will culminate in Bakhmut (or it already has) and the RuAF will likely enter an operational pause because of depleted offensive power. That pause will likely last longer than the Ukrainians plan to wait for their counterattack. Basically, only the possibility of victory in Bakhmut can induce the Russians to continue wasting their soldiers lives so recklessly before the spring. Second, because the current loss ratios are pretty well understood and relatively predictable, which is not necessarily true if they retreat. Retreating under fire is challenging even for elite units, and results are naturally unpredictable. Assessing the hypothetical defensibility of any fallback positions is also challenging, especially with sufficient accuracy to be able to meaningfully predict what kind of loss ratio improvements you might gain from repositioning. Third--and this reason is entirely hypothetical--it is possible that the Ukrainians have sufficient intelligence about Russian reserves to know exactly how long they need to hold out, and so perceive the hopefully quite proximate end to a battle that appears to us as outsiders as a limitless meatgrinder that will continue to waste Ukrainian lives indefinitely into the far future. Essentially, they know the price they are paying and what they are getting for it more precisely than we do.\n\nIn contrast, on the offensive, the UAF will likely experience a loss ratio that favors the Russians, even if the offensive is generally successful. The exchange in Bakhmut will be particularly favorable if they are able to trade less well-trained conscript formations for the few remaining high quality Russian formations such as Wagner's assault units and the remnants of the VDV. Notably [the VDV played a critical role in holding the line in Kherson and delaying the UAF's offensive there until the successful Russian withdrawal across the Dnipro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Kherson_counteroffensive), and it seems reasonable that the Ukrainians don't want to see a repeat delay that may buy time for subsequent waves of Russian force generation. Bottom line, the Ukrainians need to fight these Russian reserves no matter what, and it will nearly always be more favorable to fight them on the defensive than offensive. The challenge with fighting them on the defensive is that the Russians need to agree to go on the offensive first, which means the Ukrainians need to fool the Russians into thinking an attack benefits their strategic objectives. Blessedly, the \"we are lucky they are so fucking stupid\" guy continues to be the reigning champ of summarizing this war in a single laconic sentence and the Russians have been willing to oblige the Ukrainians with attacks all throughout the mud season. \n\nBut by \"fool the Russians\", I really mean fool Putin. [He is micromanaging the war, even dictating decisions at the level of colonels or brigadiers such as when to commit reserves, and that likely includes the much more momentous decision to commit the very last of their available combat reserves](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/putin-involved-russia-ukraine-war-western-sources). He has repeatedly pushed the RuAF [to make objectively poor military decisions for political purposes](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1576380514436800512), and he does not receive reliable information, because [he has reduced his circle of confidants to only a couple of advisors who largely tell him what he wants to hear and he does little to gather his own independent information](https://youtu.be/kSNo2FPQDQw?t=1862).\n\n[Putin is also a classic bully in the distinctive style of the KGB, as Yale professor of history Timothy Snyder describes in an interview here](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interview/timothy-snyder/). Their method is always to look for an opponent's weaknesses, and then to ruthlessly expand and exploit those weaknesses. Probably worth mentioning that Timothy Snyder [has met with and advised Zelensky directly](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/9766/Artykul/3064861,Zelensky-thanks-distinguished-Yale-historian-Timothy-Snyder), so his views aren't just an academic theory, they reflect and influence the views of the actual Ukrainian decisionmakers. Those decisionmakers clearly understand that Putin's instinct is to attack weakness with maximum force, and therefore carefully shape perceptions of Ukrainian weakness to mislead Putin into attacking the wrong targets. I mean, it's pretty widely accepted that the Ukrainains signal weakness intentionally when trying to attract western support, so why should it be surprising that they apply the same techniques to deceiving Putin?\n\nAnd that is also another reason why the Ukrainians can't just throw their best troops into the battle. If there were no weakness around Bakhmut, the Russians would simply stop attacking with those critically valuable remaining high quality VDV formations.\n\n**What weaknesses should the Ukrainians use to mislead Putin?**\n\nPutin is not an idiot, so the UAF can't simply invent weaknesses out of thin air. Instead, they have to find ways to exaggerate some real weaknesses while downplaying others. In this case, I think they are combining their very real Soviet-hangover leadership weakness with their related difficulties around conscription to lure the Russians into attacking Bakhmut under unfavorable conditions. Specifically, I am referring to the stories around conscription problems which imply manpower deficits across the board for the UAF and stories suggesting the defense of Bakhmut will compromise future UAF counteroffensives. Playing up those particular weaknesses presents an ideal picture to appeal to Putin's prejudices and his desperation for a politically palatable conclusion to the hostilities. If you blame Soviet-style leadership, it makes the Ukrainians look dumb and incompetent for not retreating, and suggests they remain saddled by the same legacy that has so limited Russian military capabilities during this war, which plays to Putin's belief in Russian superiority. It also suggests to Putin that not only can he achieve the minimally viable political victory he so desperately needs by taking Bakhmut, he can also compromise the Ukrainian ability to conduct future counteroffensives with the very same blow, opening the way for a negotiated settlement that freezes the current lines (plus/minus changes around Bakhmut). It's really the best remaining even theoretically conceivable outcome for Putin, and many of the recent stories and leaks from Ukrainian-aligned media seem perfectly crafted to suggest continuing to attack Bakhmut could very well achieve that outcome. Suspiciously perfect, I would argue.\n\nThere have been few reports of widespread difficulty around draft dodging in Ukraine until quite recently, well into the battle for Bakhmut, when suddenly a flood of stories appeared in the media about people avoiding conscription and Ukrainian officials aggressively conscripting people against their will, e.g. from [the Economist](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/26/ukraine-finds-stepping-up-mobilisation-is-not-so-easy) and [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-faces-same-glaring-problem-russia-1786477). Which struck me as odd, [considering that the Ukrainians have more than a million reservists and earlier in the war had far more volunteers than capacity to train them for at least the first six months of the war](https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-military-turns-volunteers-away-as-140k-ukrainians-come-home-to-fight-russia). Even as recently as December, [Zaluzhny said that the UAF does *not* have manpower issues so much as a need for armor and munitions](https://www.economist.com/zaluzhny-transcript). So where are the volunteers, why are the units around Bakhmut being reinforced with untrained conscripts, and why all the news stories about aggressive conscription? My hypothesis is that the volunteers are funneled into the more NATO-style units, most of which are currently in reserve or training behind the lines, while the Soviet-influenced commanders are given conscripts (at least as a preference if not as a hard rule) and are burning through them faster than other units, mostly in the Donbas meat grinders around Avdiivka and Bakhmut. The prioritization of allocating volunteers to the more NATO-oriented units makes a lot of sense in that context. Mission command requires motivation and self-direction, which you are more likely to find in volunteers. Conscripts can perform at wildly varying levels, and generally can't be relied on as much to take initiative, and so are a better fit for the top-down Soviet command style. This preference or bias could also come about naturally because of self-sorting, as more Soviet-style commanders may be more willing to take on reluctant conscripts than more NATO-oriented leaders, and older officers steeped in Soviet doctrine will have more relevant experience for leading formations with older Soviet kit.",

                    "body": "If that's how recruits are being allocated, it explains some of the resistance to conscription, because conscripts are disproportionately funneled straight into the meat grinder by default. For example, [the story that has made the rounds of a soldier who received only five days of training before being deployed to Bakhmut](https://censor-net.translate.goog/ua/blogs/3402648/na_peredovu_pslya_5_dnv_pdgotovki_abo_za_lashtunkami_eltnogo_pdrozdlu_zsu?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp). That soldier's experience doesn't mean the regular army volunteer units are having difficulty filling out their TOE or training their soldiers, just that some of the units most reliant on conscripts are. Notably his formation was the 101st Brigade for the Protection of the General Staff, which may be just about the most irregular unit in the entire UAF command structure, outside whatever chaos-demon worship seems to be happening over in the Ministry of Interior. The 101st is actually directly part of the General Staff, rather than assigned to an operational command, unlike every single other combat unit in the regular army. So I don't know that his experience can be considered particularly representative, although it very well might be for conscripts with the bad luck of ending up in a Soviet-style unit that also happens to be committed to intense combat operations. But that's not all the units by a long shot. It's likely that for every soldier like that around Bakhmut, there are multiple comparable conscripts assigned to relatively quiet or less intense AOs where they are given the opportunity to learn some basic military skills on the job from the more senior members of their unit. So this would actually be a good way to increase their training pipeline, if somehow they could both predict where attacks would come with 100% certainty to avoid allocating untrained conscripts there and yet still somehow need to maintain high force density throughout the front, which seem like mutually contradictory propositions. It's a morally questionable but potentially effective technique for growing the training pipeline if they allocate excess untrained conscripts evenly across the front without regard to the risk that they will be thrown into combat unprepared, which this story seems to suggest may be their practice. (edit: it occurs to me that this would be an excellent way to make use of excess conscripts who were recruited primarily to mislead Russia about the level of manpower issues the UAF is experiencing)\n\nThis strategy of allocating resources across units suggests losses around Bakhmut won't compromise any offensive, because the offensive units are drawing on entirely different recruitment streams, training resources, and equipment types than the defensive units are. The conscript-heavy formations on the frontline at this very moment are serving to absorb Russian attacks and burn through Russian reserves while the more professional units prepare for an offensive that has the potential to be decisive. If it seems unfair to give worse equipment to the people doing the harder fighting right now, just remember economy of force. Bakhmut is secondary to the offensive. In the longer term, the recruitment challenges won't matter as much once the current Russian reserves are exhausted because the meat grinder will be over, and the UAF will no longer need to feed it. By the time Russia can generate any further forces for their own offensives, the Ukrainians will be over the hump in terms of adopting western tanks, IFVs, and combined arms doctrine and will have slack to retrain the units currently holding the lines to meet the same standards.\n\n**But what about the spring offensive?**\n\nThe only contrary evidence to that assessment are reports, usually sourced from anonymous US or NATO defense officials, [that western officials are telling the UAF that defending Bakhmut may compromise their ability to conduct a spring counteroffensive](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-14-2023). Which really makes no sense at all to me, based on what formations and equipment types are allocated to Bakhmut. The reports are anonymous and lack any supporting detail beyond the basic claim. As I described above, the units around Bakhmut aren't the kinds of units the Ukrainians are likely to use on an offensive in the near future. I therefore tend to dismiss those anonymous reports as leaks intended to spread disinformation, and in particular to invite the Russians to feel confident in committing their reserves to an attack on Bakhmut. \n\nThe Russians (and more to the point Putin) may conclude that it's worth burning through their reserves if doing so compromises the Ukrainian ability to counterattack, and these leaks seem suspiciously well designed to invite that conclusion. If the leaked reports about compromising the offensive were true, they probably would not have been leaked at all, because they reveal an actual Ukrainian weakness in a manner which does nothing to protect that weakness. Contrast that scenario to leaks about the dire need for more long range artillery from about a year ago. Russia could absolutely figure out that the Ukrainians needed better long range fires on its own, so the leaks didn't risk revealing new information, yet did actively invite a solution in the form of western donations. Whereas the leak about Bakhmut (if true) just airs Ukrainian dirty laundry, with no real hope of changing the Ukrainian decision or bringing in additional western support. Meaning, it would be a *disloyal* leak, of which we have not seen many if any from the US/NATO side during this war (potentially not including the general jockeying between the allies for position around major weapons contributions like tanks). Basically the leak was like saying, \"Oh no, Putin, whatever you do please don't attack Bakhmut, anywhere but there!\" Something tells me the Ukrainians aren't inclined to give Putin *good* advice about how to hurt them.\n\nPlaying the conscription issues up in the media only serves to draw Russian attention to that weakness, too. So why are the Ukrainians permitting these stories to leak, or at least not taking any measures to limit their impact on the information space? [One such story was about a man with no hands being denied an exemption from conscription, despite having been classified officially as permanently disabled for his entire life](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/26/ukraine-finds-stepping-up-mobilisation-is-not-so-easy). It is an insane and ridiculous story of bureaucratic incompetence, which if true I would have expected the Ukrainians to suppress during war time because it makes them look so incompetent (again, note how the whiff of corruption and incompetence appeals to Putin's preconceived notions about Ukrainians) and because it was limited enough in scope that it could have been kept away from western reporters (unlike something as pervasive as widespread resistance to conscription). Instead the story was almost actively promoted by UAF-friendly sources like the Economist, which I believe broke the story originally. The Economist is quite explicitly pro-Ukrainian and is also cozy enough with the Ukrainian leadership to have gotten exclusive in-depth interviews with Zelensky, Zaluzhny, Budanov, Syrsky, and others, some of which I even linked as sources above. So it is out of character for them to publish such a lurid anecdote of Ukrainian incompetence. On the other hand, if the Ukrainians wanted to convince the Russians that they are having manpower issues, one of the easiest ways to do so would be to send out their recruiters and encourage them to employ excessive aggression. Then to leak, plant, falsify, or simply permit publication of stories about the absurd lengths those officials are going to conscript new troops. The Russians would then pick up on the stories and possibly inaccurately infer manpower deficits. Even if the Russian intelligence agencies interpret the stories differently, Putin is more likely to disregard them and rely on media reports than he would have been in past years, before the FSB's incredibly inaccurate pre-war assessments of Ukraine contributed to his decision to invade. It would not surprise me at all to learn that Putin regularly reviews Russia-related press clippings from the Economist to understand how critical issues are being presented in the western media, even if only as part of a larger security or political briefing packet. In fact it would surprise me if he doesn't review at least a sampling of stories from western media, likely heavily biased toward traditional print media with wide influence like the Economist. Which makes it a viable channel for shaping Putin's perceptions, and the man without hands seems like the perfect attention grabbing detail to make sure he sees that particular story. \n\nSo basically, propaganda cuts both ways. We are operating in an information space that is quite intentionally shaped by Ukraine, and so should be careful in our conclusions about what is happening beneath the fog of war. Although, I would suggest that it's probably a good starting assumption that the Ukrainian leaders have not become suddenly much dumber or less capable than they have been over the last year of this war. Which isn't to say they are perfect, or that we won't see them lose their edge over time. Just that a sudden, rapid, simultaneous decline in Zaluzhny's, Zelensky's, Syrsky's, Budanov's, and the rest of the Ukrainian leadership's intelligence, judgment, and ability would be extremely unlikely. Especially if that decline persisted for a long time, as the decision to hold Bakhmut has, with ample opportunity for correction based on the widespread alarm about UAF losses.\n\nedit: all my undocumented edits on this thread are typo or white space corrections.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>If that&#39;s how recruits are being allocated, it explains some of the resistance to conscription, because conscripts are disproportionately funneled straight into the meat grinder by default. For example, <a href=\"https://censor-net.translate.goog/ua/blogs/3402648/na_peredovu_pslya_5_dnv_pdgotovki_abo_za_lashtunkami_eltnogo_pdrozdlu_zsu?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=sv&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp\">the story that has made the rounds of a soldier who received only five days of training before being deployed to Bakhmut</a>. That soldier&#39;s experience doesn&#39;t mean the regular army volunteer units are having difficulty filling out their TOE or training their soldiers, just that some of the units most reliant on conscripts are. Notably his formation was the 101st Brigade for the Protection of the General Staff, which may be just about the most irregular unit in the entire UAF command structure, outside whatever chaos-demon worship seems to be happening over in the Ministry of Interior. The 101st is actually directly part of the General Staff, rather than assigned to an operational command, unlike every single other combat unit in the regular army. So I don&#39;t know that his experience can be considered particularly representative, although it very well might be for conscripts with the bad luck of ending up in a Soviet-style unit that also happens to be committed to intense combat operations. But that&#39;s not all the units by a long shot. It&#39;s likely that for every soldier like that around Bakhmut, there are multiple comparable conscripts assigned to relatively quiet or less intense AOs where they are given the opportunity to learn some basic military skills on the job from the more senior members of their unit. So this would actually be a good way to increase their training pipeline, if somehow they could both predict where attacks would come with 100% certainty to avoid allocating untrained conscripts there and yet still somehow need to maintain high force density throughout the front, which seem like mutually contradictory propositions. It&#39;s a morally questionable but potentially effective technique for growing the training pipeline if they allocate excess untrained conscripts evenly across the front without regard to the risk that they will be thrown into combat unprepared, which this story seems to suggest may be their practice. (edit: it occurs to me that this would be an excellent way to make use of excess conscripts who were recruited primarily to mislead Russia about the level of manpower issues the UAF is experiencing)</p>\n\n<p>This strategy of allocating resources across units suggests losses around Bakhmut won&#39;t compromise any offensive, because the offensive units are drawing on entirely different recruitment streams, training resources, and equipment types than the defensive units are. The conscript-heavy formations on the frontline at this very moment are serving to absorb Russian attacks and burn through Russian reserves while the more professional units prepare for an offensive that has the potential to be decisive. If it seems unfair to give worse equipment to the people doing the harder fighting right now, just remember economy of force. Bakhmut is secondary to the offensive. In the longer term, the recruitment challenges won&#39;t matter as much once the current Russian reserves are exhausted because the meat grinder will be over, and the UAF will no longer need to feed it. By the time Russia can generate any further forces for their own offensives, the Ukrainians will be over the hump in terms of adopting western tanks, IFVs, and combined arms doctrine and will have slack to retrain the units currently holding the lines to meet the same standards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But what about the spring offensive?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The only contrary evidence to that assessment are reports, usually sourced from anonymous US or NATO defense officials, <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-14-2023\">that western officials are telling the UAF that defending Bakhmut may compromise their ability to conduct a spring counteroffensive</a>.

ISW has observed elements of Russia\u2019s WMD, along with some supplemental Central Military District (CMD), Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (DNR and LNR) and airborne (VDV) elements, arrayed along the Luhansk Oblast frontline, with a specific concentration of units along the Svatove-Kreminna line. The WMD has fully committed both rifle divisions of the 20th Combined Arms Army (CAA)\u2014the 144th Motor Rifle Division (144th MRD) and 3rd Motor Rifle Division (3rd MRD)\u2014to the Svatove-Kreminna line in Luhansk Oblast.[3] ISW has observed both of the 144th MRD\u2019s rifle regiments (the 254th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment and the 488th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment) and its tank regiment (the 59th Guards Tank Regiment) committed along the Svatove-Kreminna line but has only observed the 752nd and 252nd Motorized Rifle Regiments of the 3rd MRD by name.[4] ISW has also observed reports that elements of the 4thTank Division of the 1st Guards Tank Army, of the 26th Tank Regiment of the 47thTank Division of the 1st Guards Tank Army, and of the 27th Separate Tank Brigade of 1stGuards Tank Army are deployed along the line from Svatove north toward Kupyansk.[5] The CMD has additionally committed elements of the 6th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division to the Svatove area, and unspecified elements in the Lyman direction west of Kreminna.[6] DNR units and ad hoc formations are apparently supporting WMD operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in limited numbers, and LNR units (particularly the 4th Motorized Rifle Regiment) are engaged in the Bilohorivka area south of Kreminna.[7] Limited VDV elements, particularly of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division and of the 98th Airborne Division, appear to be supporting WMD operations in the Kreminna area as well.[8]\n\n> ISW has not observed the commitment of the 2nd Motor Rifle Division (2nd MRD) of the 1st Guards Tank Army to combat even though the unit was reported to have deployed to Luhansk Oblast. The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) noted on January 25 that the 2nd MRD partially redeployed to Luhansk Oblast from training areas in Belarus.[9] ISW has not yet observed indications that the 2nd MRD or its constituent elements\u2014the 15th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, 1st Tank Regiment, or 1st Guards Motor Rifle Regiment\u2014appear near the frontline. 2nd MRD elements are therefore likely being held in reserve in the rear of Luhansk Oblast and likely could deploy to the frontline in the future.\n\nNote that this update is from February 19th, and elements of the 2nd MRD have been observed in combat since then. \n\n> As far as I understand tens of thousands of mobniks from the last wave have yet to be committed?\n\nI think this is a common point of confusion for many observers right now.

Perun argues that the offensives began but then made essentially no progress despite burning through the bulk of the newly mobilized Russian forces, and the Russian MOD decided not to admit they had even tried in the first place.",

US officials have estimated that the Ukrainian army may have taken 120,000 casualties compared to 200,000 by the Russian army.\n\n> Kupol told the Washington Post this week that the Ukrainian army training was often poor and that some of the rookie replacements didn\u2019t know how to throw a hand grenade or fire a rifle.\n\n> Others had abandoned their positions shortly after arriving at the frontline, he said.\n\n> \u201cI get 100 new soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give me any time to prepare them. They say, \u2018Take them into the battle.\u2019 They just drop everything and run. That\u2019s it. Do you understand why? Because the soldier doesn\u2019t shoot. I ask him why, and he says, \u2018I\u2019m afraid of the sound of the shot.\u2019 And for some reason, he has never thrown a grenade. \u2026 We need NATO instructors in all our training centres, and our instructors need to be sent over there into the trenches. Because they failed in their task.\u201d\n\n> Kupol said what was left of his unit was also facing ammunition shortages.\n\n> \u201cYou\u2019re on the front line,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming toward you, and there\u2019s nothing to shoot with.\u201d\n\n> Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are being trained by the British Army and other Nato countries but thousands more receive more rudimentary training in Ukraine.\n\n> Kupol said that he had been motivated to speak out to try to improve training levels but furious Ukrainian generals instead demoted him. The Washington Post said he had consented to have his picture taken but admitted he could face \u201cpersonal blowback\u201d for his honest assessment.\n\n> Valentin Shevchenko, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military, accused Kupol of \u201cdisseminating false information\u201d. \u201cThe losses announced in the unit of which he had command are significantly overestimated,\u201d she told Ukrainian media.\n\n> Shortly after his demotion, Kupol quit the Ukrainian army.\n\n> Within hours of his reassignment to a training camp, dozens of Ukrainian soldiers, politicians and journalists had voiced their support for the battalion commander..\n\n> \u201cOne of the Armed forces finest commanders has just been removed,\u201d Yuriy Butusov, a well-known Ukrainian war correspondent, wrote on Facebook.\n\n> \u201cInstead of analysing mistakes that will defeat the Russian army, honest comments are suppressed and those who make them are punished.\u201d\n\n> The leak on casualty numbers will be deeply embarrassing for the Ukrainian military which has diligently built up a narrative of its outnumbered but highly motivated and well-trained army taking on hordes of Russian soldiers and convicts.\n\n> It also undermines confidence in their much-talked-up counteroffensive planned for spring.\n\n> The attritional nature of the war in Ukraine has killed and injured hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Both sides have admitted that they are running out of artillery shells and ammunition.\n\n> Ukraine and Russia guard their casualty numbers closely, believing that they could undermine morale, although military commanders still hint at the high death tolls at their evening briefings when they boast of killing hundreds of enemy soldiers.\n\n> On Sunday, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, said that Ukrainian forces had killed more than 1,100 Russian soldiers in the past week. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence said that day that it had killed 220 Ukrainian soldiers in the past 24 hours.\n\n> It is not possible to independently verify these numbers. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have also been killed.\n\n> On the battlefield, the British ministry of defence has said that Russian fighters led by Wagner mercenaries have broken over the river in the centre of Bakhmut, in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region, but that their advance had stalled because they were exhausted.\n\n> Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s Security Council, said that Mr Zelensky was determined to defend the city despite growing pressure to withdraw.\n\n> \u201cThis is our land, and we have no right not to defend it,\u201d he told Radio Free Europe.",

It's not about requiring automation to produce 4 more a month, it's about transforming production so that output can be more easily scaled to meet current demand without unstable hiring and laying off of skilled workers. It also increases the production gains of future capital investment. As a very crude example: if 1 engineer can cover a maximum of 10 robots vs 2 skilled workers covering 3 machining tools, then I only need to bring on 1 engineer for every 10 robots purchased vs bringing in 2 more skilled laborers for ever 3 additional machining tools.\n\nThere's also the possibility that the robots themselves can more easily scale output for much smaller operating costs (I say possibility because I do not work in manufacturing automation so I cannot say for certain). The cost of having the robot work 10 hours a day vs 6 hours a day could be much less than having the equivalent skilled labor do so. On top of all this, automation means that there's less likelihood of losing specialized skillsets during slumps. The robots can just be shut off during slumps whereas specialized labor would need to be laid off and might end up being lost forever (like moving on to other industries). The engineers overseeing these robots might also be more easily transferrable across economic sectors because the production specialization has now been abstracted to the robot programming (again, not in the industry so this is just speculation). Both of these factors mean that defense procurement can be less reliant on having to continue producing just to keep the production line alive (Congress purchasing more Abrams to keep the Lima tank plant running is a classic example of this).\n\nMaintenance of these robots is also more economically efficient: the robot maintainers can work on robots across numerous sectors of the economy and thus aren't subject to the uncertainty of defense procurement. Instead of tying up skilled labor with a defense-specific process, they can specialize in a general process (maintaining the robots) and continue to work regardless of current government procurement.",

Furthermore, if a building collapses, they can always claim &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; or something similar. Finally, they are worried that Mariupol may be recaptured in the future, so they are hurrying even more.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, don&#39;t forget that Putin&#39;s Russia is driven by political needs and corruption first and military goals second. Otherwise, Putin wouldn&#39;t invade with such a small force and would mobilize much faster and on a larger scale.</p>\n</div>",

The political calculus of everything changes when a conflict enters a frozen state.\n\nMaybe Ukraine will exceed all optimistic expectations and successfully retake Crimea in a relatively short time period.

But they are still obviously causing UA casualties.\n\nSo we have a better than nothing idea of how many casualties Ru has suffered, but basically nothing to compare it to. And the ratio is what really counts. \n\nI found a [WaPo article that gives the German estimates for UA casualties at a very believable 120,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/)\n\nIf we were to take this and UAF\u2019s recent claim of 164,910 at their word then the attrition ratio would be 1.4 Ru casualties per UA casualty. That is not massively one sided, and if it keeps going like that Ru will have the upper hand. This is why it is crucial that UA get technology, armor, and intelligence that out matches RU and that the UAF reform their tactics and strategy away from soviet doctrine. \n\nSpeculating here, but I think it will become more obvious to western observers over the next year. Last year Russia\u2019s massive military failure covered for allot of institutional problems UA had and still has. That is despite some novel adaptation and evolution of tactics on the unit level, the majority of UAF\u2019s upper command are largely Soviet old-boys who have had [much difficulty ](https://jamestown.org/program/why-the-ukrainian-defense-system-fails-to-reform-why-us-support-is-less-than-optimal-and-what-can-we-do-better/) instituting reform and fighting corruption which has been a serious problem in UA. Though obviously not as bad as RU.\n\nWith the \u201cnot one step back\u201d/\u201cfortress city\u201d policy UAF has about Bahkmut, we are starting to see signs that US/UK advisors and UA generals are not on the same page or that there is some level of resistance in strategic understanding. This is important. It is one of a few examples I\u2019ve seen so far that there Soviet doctrine and military mindset is embedded in UA command structure. If they continue to play a Soviet game with Russia of all nations, it will not go well. \n\nI\u2019m not speaking of Ru taking a ton of territory or anything so severe. But for UA, breaking this stalemate will take allot more capacity and strategic competence than any operation last year. If they run out of gas fending off RU\u2019s spring offensive, and if they fail to make significant gains themselves, they\u2019re out of the headlines. And with less positive media attention, comes less political pressure to support them. And make no mistake, it is Europe and the US keeping them alive and fighting. UA does not have the wiggle room to expend men and resources casually.\n\nAll this to say that though most of RU\u2019s war aims are basically lost, UA\u2019s war aims are also very much on a thin line.

That is despite some novel adaptation and evolution of tactics on the unit level, the majority of UAF\u2019s upper command are largely Soviet old-boys who have had <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/why-the-ukrainian-defense-system-fails-to-reform-why-us-support-is-less-than-optimal-and-what-can-we-do-better/\">much difficulty </a> instituting reform and fighting corruption which has been a serious problem in UA. Though obviously not as bad as RU.</p>\n\n<p>With the \u201cnot one step back\u201d/\u201cfortress city\u201d policy UAF has about Bahkmut, we are starting to see signs that US/UK advisors and UA generals are not on the same page or that there is some level of resistance in strategic understanding. This is important. It is one of a few examples I\u2019ve seen so far that there Soviet doctrine and military mindset is embedded in UA command structure. If they continue to play a Soviet game with Russia of all nations, it will not go well. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not speaking of Ru taking a ton of territory or anything so severe. But for UA, breaking this stalemate will take allot more capacity and strategic competence than any operation last year. If they run out of gas fending off RU\u2019s spring offensive, and if they fail to make significant gains themselves, they\u2019re out of the headlines. And with less positive media attention, comes less political pressure to support them. And make no mistake, it is Europe and the US keeping them alive and fighting. UA does not have the wiggle room to expend men and resources casually.</p>\n\n<p>All this to say that though most of RU\u2019s war aims are basically lost, UA\u2019s war aims are also very much on a thin line. This will be the sink or swim year.</p>\n</div>",

At least to my mind, a frozen conflict is low (or no) intensity and indefinitely sustainable by both sides.  Think the War in the Donbas from 2015-2022.  A war of attrition with stable front line is high intensity and unsustainable in the long run.  Think Western Front in WW1.  I think this war is more like WW1 than the Donbas War.\n\nThat's why I included \"at the current level of fighting\" in my post.  Because at the current level, Russia is losing more tanks, IFVs, and aircraft than it can produce.  It's expending more missiles and ammo that it produces.  Manpower losses already forced it to partially mobilize and it will need to more fully mobilize to replace losses if the casualties continue at the current pace.  Partial mobilization probably caused Russia to lose more men to emigration than war casualties.  While it does have the manpower to sustain these casualties, I would think it would eventually cause too much political unrest to keep going for years and years.  Sanctions have already started to choke Russian economy, they lost their best customer for selling energy resources and their budget is looking like a disaster already.  Likewise, I think there are legitimate questions about Ukraine's ability and the West's willingness to sustain the conflict indefinitely.  So, I don't think the current level of fighting is sustainable in the long run (i.e., years, maybe many years) and one or other will eventually crack.  I should say some sort of negotiated settlement is also a possibility.  Any agreement is unimaginable right now, but maybe the willingness to reach a settlement will go up as the strain of war increases.  I suppose what I would call a frozen conflict is also possible, although I think that would require Ukraine to drastically lose interest in liberating their territory or perhaps the US, EU, and maybe even Poland to withdraw support without any peace deal with Russia.",
