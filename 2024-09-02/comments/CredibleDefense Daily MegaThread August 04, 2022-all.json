The UN isn't the sole place international law is made.\n\nZawahiri and Soleimani are very different situations. Zawahiri is a non-state terrorist, and the norms behind killing them wherever they are found are fairly strong. As I said the host state tends to object, as they are obligated to because they claim the right of noninterference in their territory, but nobody else really does. Soleimani was an Iranian agent, and the norms do not support killing agents of other governments, which is why the reactions to killing Zawahiri and Soleimani were very different. The reaction to kill Zawahiri was straightforward celebration. The reaction to killing Soleimani was some celebration, but far more confusion over WTF we were doing and what the consequences of breaking the norm would be.\n\nChechnya is an interesting example because it's not even a different country, it's part of Russia, so it really has very limited value when compared to killing people in other countries. I haven't seen much criticism of Russia for making the decision to assert their control over Chechnya. The criticism is of the way they did it - with indiscriminate slaughter of civilians. What Russia did to Chechnya would be like if America learned that Zawahiri was somewhere in Kabul, so they carpet bombed the entire city with B-52's and killed every resident to make sure they got him.\n\nSo ultimately, what this comes down to is international norms regarding what is acceptable to do, and how it is acceptable to do it. It's acceptable to kill terrorists in other countries and it's acceptable to assert your control over your own territory when it rebels. It's not acceptable to kill agents of other governments.\n\nIf it's acceptable to do something, the acceptable manner to do it in is to minimize civilian casualties. That's why killing Zawahiri is acceptable and massacring Chechnyan civilians is not. This is the perennial Russian problem. They see the US do something they don't like and the world accept it. They say \"well haha, two can play at that game!\" They go out and do it, committing atrocities left and right. Then they notice the whole world looking on in horror, and they say \"I don't get it, you didn't have a problem when the US did it. Hypocrites!\" I'm incredibly confused by why you, likewise, are not intuitively grasping the difference between making substantial efforts to avoid civilian casualties and going out of your way to kill civilians.\n\nAs far as why we aren't drone striking Rio de Janeiro, three reasons. One is that Brazil isn't harboring as many terrorists as the Taliban are. Two is that we have better relations with Brazil than Afghanistan, so requesting extradition is a viable alternative. Three is that we have better relations with Brazil than Afghanistan, so the consequences of killing people in Brazil are more substantial than the consequences of killing people in Afghanistan.",

Bizarrely, it ratified the treaty in 1970 when it was China in the eyes of the world, but now that China is China and Taiwan is generally not considered a sovereign state, it couldn\u2019t sign even if it wanted to.</p>\n\n<p>Even if Taiwan secretly develops nuclear weapons, it will not be able to keep it a secret. Where will nuclear tests should be conducted after preliminary studies? Even if it works, where will it be deployed? If America sanctions a Taiwanese nuclear program, every state will throw the NPT in the bin.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s not brought up as a serious option</p>\n</div>",

What a stretch. \n\n> Japan, a country constitutionally bound to not fight non-defensive wars, has said the US and Japan must defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion and indicating that Taiwan is a matter of self-defense for Japan.\n\nAgain, Japan has said this many, many, many times in the past, throughout various U.S. administrations. Literally Google Japan, Taiwan, self-defense 1990, 1980, 1970 and you'll see it. \n\n> US Congress has bipartisan support towards engagement with Taiwan. And the current Speaker of the House, the 3rd in line to the sitting president and who is apart of the same party as the sitting President has just visited Taiwan pledging that the American commitment to democracy on the self-governing island and elsewhere \u201cremains ironclad.\u201d\n\nThis was true when Gingrich visited in **1997**.

This is the second time Biden has stated he would defend Taiwan. So far as for you to say, oh he was just equivalently expressing moral outrage here as he had in the past in other situations, the question in context was directly compared to Ukraine. Specifically, \"if the US would defend Taiwan militarily if China invaded, **when it has not done so in the invasion of Ukraine?**\". To be extra clear, Biden is not so geriatric he can't understand a direct question of US only opting for weapons and intelligence deliveries to Ukraine, to whether or not the US would escalate and defend *Taiwan militarily*. This question was asked deliberately in contrast from Ukraine.\n\nSo you have on record, *twice*, from the POTUS that he would defend Taiwan, while in comparison to Ukraine in which the US has not military defended. Only for the State Department to conveniently walk back those statements?\n\nAnd guess who else has played this exact move? Japan, the other country most aligned with the US in countering China. [\u201cIf a major incident happened, it\u2019s safe to say it would be related to a situation threatening the survival [of Japan]. If that is the case, Japan and the U.S. must defend Taiwan together,\u201d Japanese media quoted Aso as saying](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/12/taro-aso-taiwan-japan-china-policy/). Taro Aso was Japan's Deputy Prime Minister at the time, who was 80 years old and gaffe prone. \n\n>\"To some analysts, Aso was therefore the perfect person to issue a warning to China with the ability to then express plausible \ndeniability.\" \n\n>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a renegade statement,\u201d said Corey Wallace, a foreign-policy expert at Kanagawa University in Yokohama, Japan. \u201cThe surprising thing was that he said this in public. This represents a change in tone by Japan.\u201d But Wallace said that Aso\u2019s comments reflected what Japanese officials have long believed privately\" \n\n>\"The Biden-Suga statement reaffirmed that the islands are covered under the U.S.-Japan security treaty even though Washington has politely declined to pass judgment on their actual sovereignty.\"\n\nTo see how carefully choreographed these actions and statements are. Here's what Biden said to Xi Jinping: [\"I said that they have to decide -- Taiwan, not us. We are not encouraging independence.\"](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/politics/biden-china-taiwan/index.html) While the CCP loves to paraphrase this as \"the US doesn't support Taiwanese independence\" and the State Department happily goes along with it, the subtle message change is, *the US would support whatever Taiwan supports*.\n\nThen you look at Congress, and big surprise, one of the only few things Republicans and Democrats can agree on is more engagement with Taiwan.\n\nFor example, [Pompeo on his last day in the Trump Administration at the State Department lifted all high-level engagement restrictions between US diplomats and Taiwanese representatives](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan-diplomacy/pompeo-lifts-restrictions-on-u-s-taiwan-relationship-as-clock-runs-out-on-trump-administration-idUSKBN29E0Q6), providing cover and plausible deniability for the incoming Biden administration (not our fault). These are all coordinated moves.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n1. Biden, the President of the United States has *twice* said he would come to the defense of Taiwan militarily\n\n2. Biden directly said he would come to the defense of Taiwan despite not coming to the defense of Ukraine, a direct comparison\n\n3. [Biden says Taiwan's independence is up to Taiwan after discussing matter with Xi](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/politics/biden-china-taiwan/index.html)\n\n4. US Congress has bipartisan support towards engagement with Taiwan. And the current Speaker of the House, the 3rd in line to the sitting president and who is apart of the same party as the sitting President has just visited Taiwan pledging that the American commitment to democracy on the self-governing island and elsewhere \u201cremains ironclad.\u201d\n\n5. Japan, a country *constitutionally bound* to not fight non-defensive wars, has said the US and Japan must defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion and indicating that Taiwan is a matter of self-defense for Japan. This cannot be understated especially when Japan is a pacifist country.\n\n6. The US State Department has removed all restrictions on high-level US diplomats engaging with Taiwan on the last day of the Trump administration paving the way for Biden to continue engagement\n\n7. [Biden's State Department further clarifies that the Biden administration intends to \u201cliberalize\u201d the rules to reflect the \u201cdeepening unofficial relationship\u201d between the U.S. and Taiwan.](https://apnews.com/article/mike-pompeo-taiwan-china-7cb96655a9871fcba6a12e6246fceced)\n\n8. Even the CCP does not see Pelosi's visit as a personal visit, because they're apart of the same political party and the majority party in control right now. It has quite clearly said in its statements and actions that it views the US is not adhering to its own policies.\n\nLike sure, do you really think all of these things just happened on their own without coordination or planning? That these are all disparate coincidences? That Japan, a pacifist country, would announce its intents to defend Taiwan alone without the blessing if not outright encouragement from the US? That both Republicans and Democrats haven't been working together to restart official engagement with Taiwan? If nothings changed then why is the CCP in such fear of these actions?\n\nThe answer is that these are all acts to slowly change US unofficial policy without the shock of making a sudden official reversal in US policy. In the same way that the Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates over time, instead of hiking it to 5% immediately to counter inflation, it's to provide everyone else with stability and the ability to plan for the future. It's clear as day US policy over Taiwan is changing.\n\nFinally, *even if* you were to assume that none of this is coordinated and it's all chaos and coincidence, the trends still nonetheless show that we're sleepwalking into a change in US actions and policies over Taiwan.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>EDIT: to the person that refuted what I was saying by pointing to this article before deleting their post, here&#39;s my response:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I deleted it because I&#39;m a bit tired of going over it, but I&#39;ll play ball.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, for all of your assertions that U.S. policy is shifting in contradiction to numerous statements saying the U.S. is looking to maintain the status quo, is to point to Biden saying the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, as much as you dismiss the State Department as having walked back his statements. This is the second time Biden has stated he would defend Taiwan. So far as for you to say, oh he was just equivalently expressing moral outrage here as he had in the past in other situations, the question in context was directly compared to Ukraine. Specifically, &quot;if the US would defend Taiwan militarily if China invaded, <strong>when it has not done so in the invasion of Ukraine?</strong>&quot;. To be extra clear, Biden is not so geriatric he can&#39;t understand a direct question of US only opting for weapons and intelligence deliveries to Ukraine, to whether or not the US would escalate and defend <em>Taiwan militarily</em>. This question was asked deliberately in contrast from Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>So you have on record, <em>twice</em>, from the POTUS that he would defend Taiwan, while in comparison to Ukraine in which the US has not military defended. Only for the State Department to conveniently walk back those statements?</p>\n\n<p>And guess who else has played this exact move? Japan, the other country most aligned with the US in countering China. <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/12/taro-aso-taiwan-japan-china-policy/\">\u201cIf a major incident happened, it\u2019s safe to say it would be related to a situation threatening the survival [of Japan]. If that is the case, Japan and the U.S. must defend Taiwan together,\u201d Japanese media quoted Aso as saying</a>. Taro Aso was Japan&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister at the time, who was 80 years old and gaffe prone. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;To some analysts, Aso was therefore the perfect person to issue a warning to China with the ability to then express plausible \ndeniability.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a renegade statement,\u201d said Corey Wallace, a foreign-policy expert at Kanagawa University in Yokohama, Japan. \u201cThe surprising thing was that he said this in public. This represents a change in tone by Japan.\u201d But Wallace said that Aso\u2019s comments reflected what Japanese officials have long believed privately&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;The Biden-Suga statement reaffirmed that the islands are covered under the U.S.-Japan security treaty even though Washington has politely declined to pass judgment on their actual sovereignty.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To see how carefully choreographed these actions and statements are.

My point is that you're reading into internal U.S. political machinations. They aren't about China and Taiwan. They're all about political one-upmanship. It's about domestic talking points, and who can appear tougher for the election in 24. \n\n> Because the end result is still the 3rd in line of succession to the US just visiting Taiwan and pledging ironclad support.\n\nNonsense. I literally quoted what she said as soon as she got off the plane. Not only that, but Gingrich was also there in 97. Where were you then, with your consternation? \n\n> And the rest of your post consists of nitpicking analyst interpretations of certain factors without looking at the bigger picture in aggregate. \n\nClassic. You literally take my criticism of your analysis and try to deflect it on to me. \n\n> And also conveniently not responding to every other point that diminishes your arguments.\n\nWhich points have I not addressed? I'd be happy to. For whatever reason, I can't respond to your comment directly. But, while we're on that topic, explain Bush 01 and Gingrich 97, and the explanation for Pompeo while you're at it. Also explain the provocative actions China has been taking, is taking currently, and will undoubtedly take in the future. Why has the Western response been so tepid, if they really want to change their policy re: Taiwan. \n\n> And others have already mentioned, the mere fact that the State Department and White House needs to keep reaffirming their positions shows that there are actions taken by the US that are slowly hallowing out US official policy on Taiwan.\n\nAgain, absolute nonsense. There were numerous times during the pandemic where the U.S. admin and Fauci had to repeatedly reemphasize positions and policies that hadn't changed ever since they had been instituted.

Of course Ukraine is fighting from populated areas, they're fighting in every city, town, and village across a 1,500km front. The suggestion that Ukrainian forces should move to military bases or open fields is not a realistic one when the enemy has thousands of long range missiles to strike you with. \n\nI have no doubt that over the course of the war, especially in the hectic early days, Ukrainian forces were fighting from positions in relatively heavily populated areas, but with most of the fighting for the past 4 months being relegated to conflict zones in the South and East this is less common than ever. The report itself tacitly acknowledges this considering all the civilian casualties they noted were 50 years old (who was caring for his 70+ year old mother) and up, which is consistent with the fact that for the most part only the elderly have stayed behind in the conflict zones.\n\nThis reminds me of the report they did on the YPG claiming that they were \"committing war crimes\" because a dozen IS-affiliated villages were razed in their territory. There's a difference between something bad happening on a battlefield and something being a widespread sanctioned practice by authorities, a distinction Amnesty seems to struggle with.",

The less time the Russians have to fire artillery on any one position means the less damage they do.\n\nAlso, the more Russian artillery pieces have to move, because the battlefield isn't moving, the less they can fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It seems to me that Ukraine is trading lives for time in the Donbas, with the hope that time will allow them to succeed in Kherson.\n\nThe UAF have been following the same tactics since April, hold ground at all cost.  Nothing has changed since the Kherson counteroffensive started in late May. Nothing has changed since mid July when the \"bigger\" Kherson counteroffensive was hyped.\n\nTheir tactics seem to be based on an operational goal dictated by strategic policy to willingly trade UAF lives (success) to try to hold ground at all cost (fail) while delaying the Russian advance(success), while trying to cause heavy Russian losses (fail, at least in relation to extremely heavy UAF losses).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I always wonder what the alternative is.\n\nI can't give a playbook on how to win in the Donbas from a keyboard, there are too many unknowns, namely shit involving resupply, comms, EW, drones, artillery capabilities and TTPs, and especially realistic appraisal of UAF fighting capabilities, especially leadership down to the platoon level (what can they actually accomplish? How disciplined are they?)\n\nThat said, there are a few simple things that they could do right now without major changes that would help.\n\nFirst, Kyiv needs to stop micromanaging the war using politically defined objectives based on morale and m-f'ing polling bullshit. The destruction of a town a UAF unit is defending should not trigger a retreat, its existence should not encompass tactical and operational planning other than its military value. They need to give clear cut strategic guidance that lowers holding ground, especially every square centimeter, as the No. 1 priority.\n\nKilling Russians can't be No. 1, the manner in which the Russians are fighting and UAF artillery deficiencies preclude that. But we do know the UAF does want to go on the offensive, and for that they need experienced troops, so preservation of the force should be up there with buying time.\n\nNext, Ukraine needs to counterattack more. We saw in early June in Severondonetsk and recently north of Dolyna (Izyum axis heading towards  Sloviansk) how much those can catch Russians off balance. They need to be doing counterattacks as priority, only defending in between counterattacks. That will restore mobility a bit, which upsets Russian performance, who perform like as if not following a strict plan as part of a set piece battle.\n\nWhen they are defending, they need more depth. If they have insufficient forces to only form a crust on the front lines with barely anything behind them, they have too few troops. That means the overall frontage is too large, which means either retreating now to compress the overall line, or it means a defense in depth to fall back to those lines with tactical commanders having the authority to do it as needed. Again, I cannot stress this enough, the destruction taken to towns they are defending should not at all play a part, it should be based off the actual tactical situation of the units tasked with holding them.\n\nWhen they are sedentary, they need to dig to live. That doesn't mean more shitty open top trenches, 1914 style, which seems to be what the UAF is primarily using. I means Iwo JIma level tunneling and fortifications. They also need to prioritize camouflage. Russian fires superiority is greater than it should be because their drones are finding targets. UAF can't shoot them down or jam them well enough, but a super cheap and easy mitigation is to hide from them. That means everything is camouflaged to maximum, especially from bird's eye view. After over half a century of warfare where various forces had to try to outwit an enemy with fires/air superiority, there is no reason Ukraine doesn't try to emulate them. A whole new chapter in that story should be written here about conducting a successful defense and instead we're basically rewatching 1914 but with AKs and cell phones.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>then Russia would just advance and begin shelling them with artillery superiority again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The longer Russians shell any one position, the more damage they cause to it, the more casualties they cause. The less time the Russians have to fire artillery on any one position means the less damage they do.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the more Russian artillery pieces have to move, because the battlefield isn&#39;t moving, the less they can fire.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that Ukraine is trading lives for time in the Donbas, with the hope that time will allow them to succeed in Kherson.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The UAF have been following the same tactics since April, hold ground at all cost.  Nothing has changed since the Kherson counteroffensive started in late May. Nothing has changed since mid July when the &quot;bigger&quot; Kherson counteroffensive was hyped.</p>\n\n<p>Their tactics seem to be based on an operational goal dictated by strategic policy to willingly trade UAF lives (success) to try to hold ground at all cost (fail) while delaying the Russian advance(success), while trying to cause heavy Russian losses (fail, at least in relation to extremely heavy UAF losses).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I always wonder what the alternative is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t give a playbook on how to win in the Donbas from a keyboard, there are too many unknowns, namely shit involving resupply, comms, EW, drones, artillery capabilities and TTPs, and especially realistic appraisal of UAF fighting capabilities, especially leadership down to the platoon level (what can they actually accomplish? How disciplined are they?)</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are a few simple things that they could do right now without major changes that would help.</p>\n\n<p>First, Kyiv needs to stop micromanaging the war using politically defined objectives based on morale and m-f&#39;ing polling bullshit. The destruction of a town a UAF unit is defending should not trigger a retreat, its existence should not encompass tactical and operational planning other than its military value. They need to give clear cut strategic guidance that lowers holding ground, especially every square centimeter, as the No. 1 priority.</p>\n\n<p>Killing Russians can&#39;t be No. 1, the manner in which the Russians are fighting and UAF artillery deficiencies preclude that. But we do know the UAF does want to go on the offensive, and for that they need experienced troops, so preservation of the force should be up there with buying time.</p>\n\n<p>Next, Ukraine needs to counterattack more. We saw in early June in Severondonetsk and recently north of Dolyna (Izyum axis heading towards  Sloviansk) how much those can catch Russians off balance. They need to be doing counterattacks as priority, only defending in between counterattacks. That will restore mobility a bit, which upsets Russian performance, who perform like as if not following a strict plan as part of a set piece battle.</p>\n\n<p>When they are defending, they need more depth. If they have insufficient forces to only form a crust on the front lines with barely anything behind them, they have too few troops.

It starts with a series of outposts lines are meant to fight back and slow down the attackers, alert the main line of the main enemy avenue of advance.

Putin IMO knew it was only a matter of time before Ukraine joined the EU and became a NATO member. With the new status and leadership, that would remove corruption and have brought great wealth and prosperity to Ukraine. Putin saw this as a direct challenge to his leadership. If Ukraine ever gained great wealth and prosperity among the average citizen with a different style Government, people in Russia would look at it and wonder why they cannot be successful like Ukraine. I think this is what scared him the most personally. An educated Ukrainian making 60-80k a year with a few nice cars and a 4 bedroom house in a nice neighborhood.

Putin IMO knew it was only a matter of time before Ukraine joined the EU and became a NATO member. With the new status and leadership, that would remove corruption and have brought great wealth and prosperity to Ukraine. Putin saw this as a direct challenge to his leadership. If Ukraine ever gained great wealth and prosperity among the average citizen with a different style Government, people in Russia would look at it and wonder why they cannot be successful like Ukraine. I think this is what scared him the most personally. An educated Ukrainian making 60-80k a year with a few nice cars and a 4 bedroom house in a nice neighborhood. Voting rights, education and health care.</p>\n</div>",

Maslow's hierarchy of needs dictates that people who can't put food on the table don't have the privilege of caring in the slightest about political freedom. We don't have such fundamental concerns and therefore we have the liberty of 'wasting our time' with such pursuits.\n\nChina's an even better example. There's a tacit agreement that the people will happily forego political freedom in exchange for the government improving their quality of life. This agreement has recently been tested with things like the zero covid policy, but broadly that arrangement has been extremely successful for them. In 1990 china was poorer than sub saharan africa. Hell in 2000 they were poorer than the congo... a literal war-torn failed state. I don't think people appreciate just how much things have improved. yet they're still poorer than romania, which by western european standards is basically impoverished. Ukraine by comparison has a GDP per capita 1/3 that of china.\n\nChinese people DON'T FEEL OPPRESSED. It is not our role to tell them they are. You can sum it up with a conversation my friend had with some chinese people after the brexit vote where they said 'I can't believe your government let your people decide to hurt your country. Isn't it their job to do what's in the interest of the people'.\n\nSimilar applies to russia. Do some people want a true and free democracy? Sure, and we will amplify them to the heavens because it's what we do. Do most people care? no.

Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs dictates that people who can&#39;t put food on the table don&#39;t have the privilege of caring in the slightest about political freedom. We don&#39;t have such fundamental concerns and therefore we have the liberty of &#39;wasting our time&#39; with such pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>China&#39;s an even better example. There&#39;s a tacit agreement that the people will happily forego political freedom in exchange for the government improving their quality of life. This agreement has recently been tested with things like the zero covid policy, but broadly that arrangement has been extremely successful for them. In 1990 china was poorer than sub saharan africa. Hell in 2000 they were poorer than the congo... a literal war-torn failed state. I don&#39;t think people appreciate just how much things have improved. yet they&#39;re still poorer than romania, which by western european standards is basically impoverished. Ukraine by comparison has a GDP per capita 1/3 that of china.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese people DON&#39;T FEEL OPPRESSED. It is not our role to tell them they are. You can sum it up with a conversation my friend had with some chinese people after the brexit vote where they said &#39;I can&#39;t believe your government let your people decide to hurt your country. Isn&#39;t it their job to do what&#39;s in the interest of the people&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Similar applies to russia. Do some people want a true and free democracy? Sure, and we will amplify them to the heavens because it&#39;s what we do. Do most people care? no. Hell there was a poll taken in the donbas region of ukraine that showed a large majority didn&#39;t care if they were ukrainian or russian so long as their standard of living improved.</p>\n</div>",
