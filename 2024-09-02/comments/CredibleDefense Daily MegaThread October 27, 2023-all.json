        "body": "With everyone focused on the frontline again, it's easy to overlook the air campaign, but I just wanted to provide a brief update and some thoughts.\n\nOctober is coming to an end, and according to Ukraine, Russia has launched 27 missiles, marking the lowest tally so far since the start of the war. The last instance of such low missile activity occurred in April, with a count of around 37. Back then, many speculated that Russia had depleted its missile stockpiles after the winter strike campaign. However, I believe they simply took an operational pause as they resumed with over 200+ missiles in the following months, a notably high number.\n\nFor months, Ukraine has claimed that Russia is saving up for a winter campaign, and now the data supports this assertion. It would be unwise to assume that Russia has run out of missiles again, especially considering the significant increase in Shahed drone strikes, a quantity not observed before that offsets any lack of missile strikes.\n\nThis is solely my opinion, and I recently made an incorrect prediction about the start of the Russian campaign earlier this month. While some strikes have occurred, they are far fewer than what we witnessed last year.\n\nAlthough October marks the lowest month in missile launches, it also represents the lowest percentage of interceptions this year, largely due to a higher % number of Iskander missiles, which, according to Ukraine, are more challenging to intercept.\n\nThe timing of the winter campaign is uncertain, and its occurrence is not guaranteed. However, if it does happen, it will be interesting to observe how Ukraine's air defense holds up.\n\nUkraine now possesses Western air defense systems and boasts an excellent, albeit self-declared, record in Kyiv but also overall. They have had time to plan and gained experience against every system Russia uses for these strikes. On the other hand, they have significantly depleted their legacy Soviet stockpiles, which constitute a large portion of their systems. I doubt Russia has fewer missiles than last year; at minimum, they almost certainly have more Shahed drones in their arsenal. Russia has also accumulated experience in targeting civilian infrastructure and had time to prepare. But also noteworthy is Ukraine's willingness and capabilities to retaliate this year, something not to be ignored.\n\nIt's challenging to ascertain the accuracy of Ukraine's claims, particularly considering the severe restrictions on footage this year. Additionally, it's generally more difficult to assess what Russia has been targeting in recent months, apart from the port strikes. With a campaign concentrated on infrastructure in larger cities, it will be easier to observe. As alwayss, time will tell.",

However, I believe they simply took an operational pause as they resumed with over 200+ missiles in the following months, a notably high number.</p>\n\n<p>For months, Ukraine has claimed that Russia is saving up for a winter campaign, and now the data supports this assertion. It would be unwise to assume that Russia has run out of missiles again, especially considering the significant increase in Shahed drone strikes, a quantity not observed before that offsets any lack of missile strikes.</p>\n\n<p>This is solely my opinion, and I recently made an incorrect prediction about the start of the Russian campaign earlier this month. While some strikes have occurred, they are far fewer than what we witnessed last year.</p>\n\n<p>Although October marks the lowest month in missile launches, it also represents the lowest percentage of interceptions this year, largely due to a higher % number of Iskander missiles, which, according to Ukraine, are more challenging to intercept.</p>\n\n<p>The timing of the winter campaign is uncertain, and its occurrence is not guaranteed. However, if it does happen, it will be interesting to observe how Ukraine&#39;s air defense holds up.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine now possesses Western air defense systems and boasts an excellent, albeit self-declared, record in Kyiv but also overall. They have had time to plan and gained experience against every system Russia uses for these strikes. On the other hand, they have significantly depleted their legacy Soviet stockpiles, which constitute a large portion of their systems. I doubt Russia has fewer missiles than last year; at minimum, they almost certainly have more Shahed drones in their arsenal. Russia has also accumulated experience in targeting civilian infrastructure and had time to prepare. But also noteworthy is Ukraine&#39;s willingness and capabilities to retaliate this year, something not to be ignored.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s challenging to ascertain the accuracy of Ukraine&#39;s claims, particularly considering the severe restrictions on footage this year. Additionally, it&#39;s generally more difficult to assess what Russia has been targeting in recent months, apart from the port strikes. With a campaign concentrated on infrastructure in larger cities, it will be easier to observe. As alwayss, time will tell.</p>\n</div>",

The highest setting for this version is reportedly between 340 and 360 kilotons, which makes it one of the most powerful B61 versions. Sources differ on whether the B61-11, which we will discuss more in this story, has yield settings that are identical to that of the B61-7, or is slightly more powerful, with a 400-kiloton top setting. The B61-12's maximum yield is reportedly 50 kilotons. \n>\n> \"The B61-13 will provide the President with additional options against certain harder and large-area military targets, even while the Department works to retire legacy systems such as the B83-1 and the B61-7,\" a separate fact sheet the Pentagon released today adds.

Older B61-3 and 4 versions are also being replaced by this variant. In the past, it was also understood that the B61-12 would lead to the removal of the B61-10 from service.\n>\n> However, the Pentagon's 2018 Nuclear Posture review, which came under President Donald Trump, made it clear that the B83-1 and B61-11 would \"be retained in the stockpile, at least until there is sufficient confidence in the B61-12 gravity bomb that will be available in 2020.\" This had also reversed President Barack Obama's administration's stated plans to eliminate the B83-1 entirely.\n>\n> The Pentagon's B61-13 fact sheet also makes no mention of the B61-11 at all, indicating that version will remain in the stockpile for the foreseeable future.

At the 20th of October 2023 Russia had reserves of 573 billion dollars. \n\nSome important context here:\n\n1) roughly half of Russia's reserves are frozen by the West so they don't have acces to these reserves\n\n2) we have not seen a steady decrease in reserves, the lowest point was reached with 540 billion dollars at the 30th of September 2022. So over the last 12 months reserves have actually increased. \n\n3) the reserves here are measured in dollars and the dollar has increased in value compared to other currencies in this time period. \n\nI don't believe the data supports the claim that Russia is \"burning through its foreign currency reserves at an alarming rate\".

It's not that hard to create your own rough measure of inflation. You can hide a small lie.

I bet this is quite a worry for the Russian central bank so the interest rate increase makes sense to me. And it's not even clear at this point if a 15% interest rate is enough to stabilize both the Ruble and inflation. \n\n> natural gas and oil production have dropped dramatically over the past 2 years while the cost of producing both have gone up\n\n\"dramatically\" might be a slight exaggeration but production has decreased significantly and the long term outlook for these sectors is quite bleak after mostly having lost access to the European market. \n\n> there's a major labor shortage in the Russian economy (exacerbating inflation and reducing output), the government is cutting spending on everything not military related, and the government is implementing extreme measures against private industry (essentially stealing their foreign capital reserves, huge new taxed, forcing them to build their own paramilitary forces, etc) that are going to do medium to longterm damage to these industries.\n\nAgreed. \n\n> I imagine the Russian economy isn't in a state of imminent collapse, but I'm sure it's not doing half as well as the Russian government is trying to portray.\n\nI don't even think the official economic data is that great. There is a lot of focus on the inflation rate of 6%. Remember that 6% is still significantly above their target of 4% and that it reached this level in roughly half a year after reaching a low of close to 2% in April of this year. So inflation has been increasing quite quickly. Combine that with the declining Ruble and interest rates will remain high for quite some time. Not good for obvious reasons. \n\nThe Russian government did a good job stabilizing the economy in the early months of this war and eventually all the military spending plus the fading effect of sanctions and the shock of the war even allowed their economy to start growing again. \n\nStill, it is difficult to see where future growth is going to come from. At this point, the Russian economy has not seen much growth for the past 10 years. For a lot of Russians, the 90s are still the economic reference point so they are not even that unhappy about the current economic situation. But nothing positive would be said about any other European country with such an economic track record.

At the 20th of October 2023 Russia had reserves of 573 billion dollars. </p>\n\n<p>Some important context here:\n1) roughly half of Russia&#39;s reserves are frozen by the West so they don&#39;t have acces to these reserves\n2) we have not seen a steady decrease in reserves, the lowest point was reached with 540 billion dollars at the 30th of September 2022. So over the last 12 months reserves have actually increased. \n3) the reserves here are measured in dollars and the dollar has increased in value compared to other currencies in this time period. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe the data supports the claim that Russia is &quot;burning through its foreign currency reserves at an alarming rate&quot;. We have seen a decline since the start of this war, but especially since a lot of that decline occurred during the initial months of this war I am inclined to believe they will be able to keep this up for many more years, at least when it comes to financial reserves. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>inflation is almost certainly in the double digits</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am repeating myself here, but I would like to see more evidence before I believe this. It&#39;s not that hard to create your own rough measure of inflation. You can hide a small lie. But when you are claiming that inflation is 6% when actually it is above 10%, someone has got to be able to expose that. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the central bank has had to double rates from 7.5% to 15% over the past 4 months in an attempt to keep the Rouble worth more than .01USD</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Personally, what I find interesting here is that the Ruble has declined despite an increasing global market price for oil since this summer. I bet this is quite a worry for the Russian central bank so the interest rate increase makes sense to me. And it&#39;s not even clear at this point if a 15% interest rate is enough to stabilize both the Ruble and inflation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>natural gas and oil production have dropped dramatically over the past 2 years while the cost of producing both have gone up</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&quot;dramatically&quot; might be a slight exaggeration but production has decreased significantly and the long term outlook for these sectors is quite bleak after mostly having lost access to the European market. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>there&#39;s a major labor shortage in the Russian economy (exacerbating inflation and reducing output), the government is cutting spending on everything not military related, and the government is implementing extreme measures against private industry (essentially stealing their foreign capital reserves, huge new taxed, forcing them to build their own paramilitary forces, etc) that are going to do medium to longterm damage to these industries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Agreed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I imagine the Russian economy isn&#39;t in a state of imminent collapse, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not doing half as well as the Russian government is trying to portray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t even think the official economic data is that great. There is a lot of focus on the inflation rate of 6%. Remember that 6% is still significantly above their target of 4% and that it reached this level in roughly half a year after reaching a low of close to 2% in April of this year. So inflation has been increasing quite quickly. Combine that with the declining Ruble and interest rates will remain high for quite some time. Not good for obvious reasons. </p>\n\n<p>The Russian government did a good job stabilizing the economy in the early months of this war and eventually all the military spending plus the fading effect of sanctions and the shock of the war even allowed their economy to start growing again. </p>\n\n<p>Still, it is difficult to see where future growth is going to come from. At this point, the Russian economy has not seen much growth for the past 10 years. For a lot of Russians, the 90s are still the economic reference point so they are not even that unhappy about the current economic situation. But nothing positive would be said about any other European country with such an economic track record. Especially since Russia is so far behind economically compared to some other countries they should be growing strongly to catch up. But that just hasn&#39;t happened the past decade. The difference with countries like Poland and Romania is staggering.</p>\n</div>",

Its Divided Government May Not Be.\" A new article in the NYT reveals a continued lack of agreement among Israeli's cabinet on the plan and strategy of an invasion of Gaza, while Netanyahu demands unanimous approval from the war cabinet before moving forward.  \n\nIt also discusses deep tension between the military and the political leaders, with civil servants reportedly barring the military from bringing in recording devices into cabinet meetings\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-invasion-delay.html   \nhttps://archive.ph/K1Xpn   \n\n>Its troops are massed on the Gaza border and described as ready to move, but Israel\u2019s political and military leaders are divided about how, when and even whether to invade, according to seven senior military officers and three Israeli officials.    \n>In part, they say, the delay is intended to give negotiators more time to try to secure the release of some of the more than 200 hostages captured by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups when they raided Israel three weeks ago.    \nBut Israeli leaders, who have vowed to retaliate against Hamas for its brutal massacre of civilians, have yet to agree on how to do so, though the military could move as soon as Friday.\nSome of them worry that an invasion might suck the Israeli Army into an intractable urban battle inside Gaza. Others fear a broader conflict, with a Lebanese militia allied to Hamas, Hezbollah, firing long-range missiles toward Israeli cities.   \n>There is also debate over whether to conduct the invasion through one large operation or a series of smaller ones. And then there are questions about who would govern Gaza if Israel captured it.\n\u201cYou have a cabinet with different opinions,\u201d said Danny Danon, a senior lawmaker from Likud, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing party.   \n\u201cSome would say that we have to start \u2014 then we can think about the next stage,\u201d said Mr. Danon, a member of the foreign affairs and defense committee in the Israeli Parliament. \u201cBut we as the leadership, as statesmen, we have to set the goals, and the goals should be very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be vague.\u201d   \n\n....\n\n>The United States has urged Israel not to rush into a ground invasion, even as it pledges full support for its ally, but domestic considerations have also played a role in the delay. Beyond the hostages, there is concern about the toll of the operation and uncertainty about what exactly it might mean to destroy Hamas, a social movement as well as a military force that is deeply embedded in Gazan society.   \n>When asked what the military objectives of the operation are, an Israeli military spokesman said the goal was to \u201cdismantle Hamas.\u201d How would the army know it had achieved that goal? \u201cThat\u2019s a big question, and I don\u2019t think I have the capability right now to answer that one,\u201d the spokesman, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said at news briefing a week after the attack.   \n\n....\n\n>While there is little internal disagreement about allowing a small window of time for further negotiation, there is a dispute between the military establishment and parts of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government about what to do if the negotiations fail, according to the officials and officers.    \n>The military leadership has already finalized an invasion plan, but Mr. Netanyahu has angered senior officers by refusing to sign off on it \u2014 in part because he wants unanimous approval from members of the war cabinet he formed after the Oct. 7 attack, according to two people present at cabinet meetings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive matters.   \n>Analysts believe that Mr. Netanyahu is wary about unilaterally giving the go-ahead because, with public confidence in his leadership already decreasing, he fears being blamed if the operation fails.\n\n....\n\n>The ambiguity appears to reflect divisions in the cabinet about whether to permit a full invasion of Gaza, which might plunge ground troops into daunting urban battle against thousands of Hamas fighters hiding within a network of tunnels, hundreds of miles long, dug deep beneath Gaza City.    \nInstead, ministers are also considering a less ambitious plan involving several more limited incursions that target one small part of the enclave at a time.   \nWithin the military establishment, there is concern that Israel\u2019s goals will be blurred if Mr. Netanyahu follows through on his promise on Wednesday to simultaneously seek the liberation of all the hostages while also attempting to destroy Hamas. The first goal requires negotiation and accommodation with Hamas\u2019s leadership, while the second requires its annihilation \u2014 a difficult balance to strike, two senior military officials said.   \nIn a sign of internal division, the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, pointedly did not describe rescuing the hostages in a speech on Thursday evening as one of Israel\u2019s military objectives.   \nThe mutual suspicion between the military and the prime minister runs so deep that civil servants have barred the military from bringing recording equipment into cabinet meetings, according to two people present. They interpreted the move as an attempt to limit the amount of evidence that could be presented to a national inquiry after the war.",

If the Russian MIC can output, say, 30 vehicles per month, doesn't that mean they can afford to launch such costly offensives every three months or so?\n\nI'm not sure that Russia can produce tanks at even this level, but lets assume its correct. Russian tank losses this year have averaged, by my calculation based on data found [here](https://github.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine) (and originally taken from Oryx) Russia has lost about 80 tanks a month this year, on average. But hey Oryx is unreliable in some cases, lets take 30% off, an unreasonably high number IMO. That leaves us with 60 *lost* tanks a month. Plus more damaged, not all damaged tanks are recoverable and repairable. Thats twice your estimate of Russian production, which again from information I've seen posted here seems high. This bleak picture points towards an obvious conclusion that losses are occuring at a rate far in excess of replacement production. Set aside the logistics of a replacement system, which ensures that not every needed item gets to the front line promptly. Even if we assume that Russia is deploying every new tank in a rapid fashion to the front lines, it still means that overall tank strength is decreasing. And I would guess, though I havn't looked into the data, that in nearly every category of weapon Russia's losses are exceeding their ability to produce them. That is, in a literal sense, unsustainable. One day, in the future, before the heat death of the universe, Russia will run out of tanks (&c). \n\nThe question is how fast will that happen, and what impact will that have on the battlefield. We also know that Putin has been reluctant to mobilize further groups of men, instead favoring a 'shadow' mobilization in which soldiers are selectively picked from targeted (and largely politically irrelevant) groups to minimize the political backlash to the war. This places a pretty strict limit on Russia's ability to mobilize manpower, despite the millions of men it *could* bring into uniform. It *hasn't* and continues not to. \n\nThe real crux of unsustainability comes at a junction between two bad (for Russia) trends. As their number of heavy weapons decline, they will need to increase the role of the common infantryman. As that happens, casualties will increase as mobilized men are pit against Ukrainian high tech arms. Much rather be in a tank during a CBU strike than standing in a field, for example. The question is when do these losses add up to forcing Putin to change his strategy for the war, force him into a more traditional mass mobilization? And, leading from this, what effect does that have (if any) on Russian popular sentiment? Putin's lack of a large crushing mobilization suggests *he* feels there would be some. But what, and what size, and would that end the war? Nobody who is allowed to shitpost here knows or can say. But ultimately when people here talk about unsustainability, in a large sense they mean this. \n\nIn a shorter term tactical/operational sense, unsustainability is a little different. Regardless of how many men, tanks, and shells are in a depot in Bryansk, the units at the front experience a certain amount of \"\"\"wastage\"\"\" which reduces their combat capacity. Too many casualties, over too short a time, destroys an individual unit's ability to operate until it has had time to repair and regenerate. Unsustainable, in this context, would be synonymous with 'culmination' in a tactical or operational sense.",
