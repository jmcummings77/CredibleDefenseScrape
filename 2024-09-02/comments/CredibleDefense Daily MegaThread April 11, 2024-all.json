The remaining Tat troops have either surrendered or are begging the Thais to take them. They were camping out near the Friendship Bridge all day. Around 100 weapons were seized, including mortars and RPGs. A bunch of SKSs were also included in the capture, not terribly uncommon in Myanmar, but a bit rare to see in such numbers on military bases!\n\nMen and women of the resistance are currently [patrolling the city](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1YZU1q7AU8KsHCHE/?mibextid=WC7FNe), which appears to be completely cleared.\n\nThis is a large victory for resistance forces, further isolating the Junta from its neighbors and reducing revenues gained through border trade. Myawaddy is also a massive hub for scam centers. It remains to be seen how the resistance deals with them.

BAE is working towards localized repair and maintenance which should help Ukraine's logistics and eventually local production.  \n\n[BAE Systems Set to Maintain and Repair L119 Light Guns in Ukraine | Defense Express | April 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/bae_systems_set_to_maintain_and_repair_l119_light_guns_in_ukraine-10135.html)\n\n*The British defense company BAE Systems has signed an agreement with the UK Ministry of Defense for the maintenance and repair L119 light guns in Ukraine. The contract means that L119s can be serviced in country and returned to the frontline more quickly, providing vital support for Ukraine's defense infrastructure. The agreement was signed on April 8 during the British-Ukrainian Defense Cooperation Conference in Kyiv.*\n\n*\"This reduces the logistical burden for the Defense Forces - previously, the repair and maintenance of this equipment took place abroad and took a lot of time. It attracts partner funds and leaves them in Ukraine. In addition, localization of repair and maintenance is the first step towards localization of production,\" Alexander Kamyshin said.*\n\n*The L119 is a light gun/howitzer capable of providing either direct fire support at armored vehicles or buildings or indirect fire in support of the combat arms at ranges in excess of 10 km.*\n\n*The L119 light gun has proved to be a trusted system that Ukrainian forces have favored because of its accurate firepower, light weight, low logistical requirements and mobility.*\n\n*Gabby Costigan, Managing Director of Business Development at BAE Systems, called the signing of the agreement a basis \"for us to in the future continue to add more capabilities, so that we can repair more equipment forward, so that it can remain in the fight for Ukraine\". \"We\u2019re extremely proud to work with the UK Government in supporting Ukraine\u2019s long term defense requirements. Our experience providing support in challenging environments as well as our leading defensive cyber capabilities mean we\u2019ve played a leading role in identifying solutions that will help Ukraine secure victory, and we look forward to strengthening our relationship further\".*\n\n*According to her, the Ukrainian Armed Forces operate 17 different BAE Systems systems, so the company wants as many of these systems as possible to be repaired domestically in the future.*\n\n\nA second article that gives specifics about the Ratel S ground drone that has recently been used in operations. Ratel S developer and Ukrainian serviceman Taras Ostapchuk, tells Defense Express that this robotic platform can be used in two ways: as a kamikaze robot and as a platform for remote mining.\n\n[Unique Ukrainian \u200bRatel S Ground Drone Is in Demand Among Troops | Defense Express | April 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/ratel_s_ukrainian_ground_drone_is_in_demand_among_troops_what_is_its_uniqueness-10137.html)\n\n*It became known that Ukrainian-made Ratel S robotic platform had been successfully tested and put into mass production last fall. A video of the 5th Assault Brigade's warriors was recently released, where this ground robot equipped with mortar shells blows up one of the bridges in the village of Ivanivske in Donetsk Oblast to make it harder for Russians to organize logistics in that area.*\n\n*The robot can cover distances of up to 6 km, with a working distance of 4 km. The record for the range of a target destruction is 6.3 km. The maximum speed is 22 km/h. As Kamikaze version it can carry up to 35 kg of payload. As a mine laying drone, it can carry two anti-tank mines.*\n\n*Ostapchuk notes that today the Ratel S robotic platform is systematically supplied Ukrainian militaries at the frontline, and the waiting list for these robotic platforms is currently reaching the end of July, excluding government contracts. \"With the government contracts that are now in the final stage, we will be overwhelmed with work until the end of the year,\" he notes.*\n\n*Ostapchuk notes that the company delivered its products to militaries only after training, which lasts only two or three days. Then operators receive a ready-to-use system. \"Now the troops are creating companies of ground robotic systems, this process has begun, it is a new story,\" Ostapchuk says. One Ratel S set consists of five robotic platforms, a repeater and a ground station.*\n\n*Manufacturer has also other platform such as Ratel M and Ratel H that are approved for operation. They are designed for evacuation and logistics missions. Their range is 10 km from the operator. There is a development based on the Ratel Deminer logistics platform. It is created to destroy mines.*\n\n*\"A kamikaze and a remote mining platform can be used with a drone-repeater. The evacuation platforms are equipped with night cameras and can be operated with infrared lights for one hundred percent. In fact, the enemy cannot see anything, it is total night for the enemy as well as for its eyes, but an operator sees the distance perfectly,\" Ostapchuk says about the possibility of using the drone at night.*\n\n*The company is systematically hiring people and scaling up production. \"We are now able to ship 40-50 small platforms (Ratel S) and 2 evacuation platforms. We will reach 100 platforms and 5 or 6 evacuation platforms in a month and a half. It depends on funding from the state,\" Ostapchuk says.*\n\n*Ostapchuk also says that Ratel S platform is not protected from FPV-drones, and evacuation platforms can operate under basic control with electronic warfare installed on the platform.*",

        "body": "Here we are for the second part of my analysis on the tactical situation of the front line in Ukraine and on the events of the last month, after the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1c0jtqx/comment/kyz1f21/).\n\nAvdiivka sector. The Russians, specifically elements of the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (8th CAA, Southern MD) over the past week have resumed attacks in the direction of Novokalynove, which had almost stopped during 2024. There were successes: the Russians advanced 1 km from the south, along a tree line south of the village, and more than 1 km from the east, attacking from the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railway, occupying a farm on the outskirts of Novokalynove and attempting to move up on a tree line east of the village, only to be stopped by a counterattack which saw Bradleys in action, presumably by the 47th Mechanized Brigade (let\u2019s recall however, as I had written yesterday, that the new 88th Mech Brigade stated to have received Bradleys and is going to be deployed to a currently unknown sector). The Novokalynove area is now covered by the 115th Mech Brigade, which arrived from the Kupyansk sector, replacing the 71st Jager Brigade, moved to the southern flank of the Avdiivka sector, as we shall see. The presence of the 115th Mech Brigade in this sector had already been mentioned for about a week by the spokesman of the Group of Forces \"Centre\u201d, in the daily bulletin published by the Russian MoD. I found the Russian MoD to be quite reliable about this and they often anticipate the news of re-deployments of Ukrainian brigades before I manage to find evidence confirming that, which tells us that both sides generally know well which units they are fighting against in a given sector. The presence of the 115th Mech Brigade in Novokalinove was later mentioned by DeepState, which wrote that there were issues with this unit in the village. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine why the Russians have resumed attacks in this area: Ocheretyne, their real target, is a very important junction for the entire northern flank of the sector, as well as creating the conditions for a future offensive operation against Toretsk. \n\nIn Berdychi, the Russians in recent days have occupied the entire area of the village east of the Durna River and are currently moving northwards, arriving, the day before yesterday, in the area of the spring of the Durna, probably aiming to advance in the direction of Novobakhmutivka. \n\nIn Berdychi the 2nd CAA of the Central MD is active again, after the actions in the second half of March had been mainly the work of the 74th and 137th Motorized Brigades of the 41st CAA (CMD). Mashovets wrote yesterday that the \"new\" 433rd Motorized Regiment of the new 27th Motorized Division (2nd CAA) was brought into action in Berdychi. This is confirmed by the fact that since the last days of March on VK I have found a growing series of MIA notices of servicemen of this regiment. Which in fact it\u2019s a rebranding of the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA, which has had a handful of weeks of rest and a quick refitting, getting new recruits and equipment. The division's other two motorized regiments (506th and 589th) are in training stage in Orenburg Oblast in Russia and should be ready by June 1. \n\nFor Mashovets, the fact that this regiment has already been brought into action means that the situation regarding the Russians' reserves in the sector is beginning to be poor, but at the same time it also means that the Russians assess the Ukrainian situation as critical and that it therefore makes sense to attack and try to advance as much as possible with what they have.\n\nThe 15th Motorized Brigade (2nd CAA) is also active in Berdychi, along with subunits of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD. Elements of the 30th Motorized Brigade of the same army are active in Semenivka, along with the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps. For Mashovets the bulk of the 41st CAA has been brought to the rear for R&R and will be used as a second echelon, presumably in case of advances to the west of the Durna.\n\nThe area around Berdychi is being defended by the 47th Mech Brigade, supported by the 127th Battalion of the 112th TDF Brigade, the 171st Battalion of the 120th TDF Brigade, the 407th Battalion of the 143rd Infantry Brigade, and the 409th Battalion of the 144th Infantry Brigade (another battalion from each of these two brigades should be active in the southern flank of Avdiivka), and the Ocheretyne area by elements of the 23rd and 31st Mech Brigades.\n\nIn Semenivka (which let\u2019s recall, is in the western bank of the Durna) the Russians continue to advance northwards, albeit slowly, into the built-up area of the settlement, attacking from Orlivka. Per Russian sources there are just a few Ukrainians in the village, which is low in elevation, and the Ukrainian defensive priority is the trenches to the west of the village and the other strong points along the forest belts in the heights between Semenivka and Novoselivka Persha.\n\nFrom what I have found this area is defended by the 68th Jager Brigade, the bulk of which arrived in the Avdiivka sector in late March from the Svatove sector, replacing most of the 3rd Assault Brigade, which was likely brought to the rear, most likely to be preserved in case of future problems, e.g. a Russian \u201cbreakthrough\u201d or Ukrainian units at risk of encirclement. At the moment smaller units of the 3rd Assault Brigade are in action, as well as the brigade's artillery group and UAV units, both of which are very active and don\u2019t seem to spare DPICMs against Russian infantry.\n\nLet\u2019s recall that the Russians are supported by countless regiments of the 1st Corps and of the Territorial Forces, both in combat actions and to make up for losses in \"regular\" units. Every week I find evidence of the presence of additional such regiments in Avdiivka. From Russian social networks I found out that the 1441st Regiment of the Territorial Forces (mobilized men from Altai Krai) has been in the sector for a few weeks now, which some will remember as back in August it was attached to the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and fought heavily in Robotyne. After that it was withdrawn to the rear and according to what the Ukrainian observer Kovalenko wrote a few months ago, it was attached to the 90th Tank Division, which means it followed the division to Avdiivka. \n\nIn recent months, the 1452nd Regiment of the Territorial Forces (mobilized men from Novosibirsk Oblast), attached to the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA, was also involved in the actions. Among many others I had also read about the 1231st Regiment of the Territorial Forces (mobilized men from Tatarstan) being disbanded and its servicemen scattered among the other units deployed around Avdiivka. \n\nThe brigades of the 1st Corps are also being replenished by the regiments of the mobilization reserve of the 1st Corps: it appears that the 109th Rifle Regiment is attached to the 132nd Motorized Brigade; the 88th, 96th and 98th Rifle Regiments to the 114th Motorized Brigade; the 87th and 117th Rifle Regiments to the 1st Motorized Brigade; the 111th Rifle Regiment to the 9th Motorized Brigade. \n\nYesterday yet another episode in the series of complaints concerning Russian soldiers being forcibly sent to the 114th Brigade came out, on the \"Poisk in UA\" Telegram channel. In this case by relatives of mobilized men belonging to the 1454th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (from the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug), attached to the 1st Corps. On April 5, 100 men from this regiment were transferred to the 114th Brigade and sent on assault with only a few magazines, without proper combat kits nor artillery support, and with blocking detachments behind them, to prevent the men from retreating or stopping to rescue the wounded. After just a few days, more than half of the initial 100 men were dead or missing. On April 10, the 114th Brigade requested an additional \u201cbatch\u201d of 100 men from the 1454th Regiment, which resulted in an outcry from their relatives, who accuse the 114th Brigade of destroying the regiment. It\u2019s said that the 114th Brigade is known as \"the meat brigade\" and that its officers are cynical and rude. Second part below.",

On April 5, 100 men from this regiment were transferred to the 114th Brigade and sent on assault with only a few magazines, without proper combat kits nor artillery support, and with blocking detachments behind them, to prevent the men from retreating or stopping to rescue the wounded. After just a few days, more than half of the initial 100 men were dead or missing. On April 10, the 114th Brigade requested an additional \u201cbatch\u201d of 100 men from the 1454th Regiment, which resulted in an outcry from their relatives, who accuse the 114th Brigade of destroying the regiment. It\u2019s said that the 114th Brigade is known as &quot;the meat brigade&quot; and that its officers are cynical and rude. Second part below.</p>\n</div>",

On Ukrainian social networks there are protests from the relatives of soldiers of the 99th, 100th and 101st Mech Battalions of the 61st Mech Brigade, who allegedly had a lot of MIAs - particularly during the last days of February, at the time of the retreat from Lastochkyne to Orlivka. The command is accused of throwing the soldiers into the fray and ignoring the requests of the relatives; the brigade doesn\u2019t seem to recognize that it\u2019s in action. This is true - while most of the Ukrainian brigades make known the sector in which they are fighting, publish videos etc, by the 61st Mech Brigade there is absolute silence about the fact that they are fighting: their FB page posts anniversaries or shares posts from the General Staff, with relatives in the comments criticizing the brigade's attitude. As far as I have read, at the moment the battalions of the 61st Mech Brigade have been attached to their neighboring units, particularly to the 53rd Mech Brigade. The Russian MoD had been mentioning the presence of this brigade since late February and I found confirmation of this with the first MIA notices of servicemen from this unit (it arrived in mid-February from Chernihiv Oblast, where it was covering the border, to stem the Russian advance after the fall of Avdiivka), but from official Ukrainian sources there was never any acknowledgment that this brigade is fighting in Avdiivka.\n\nFrom Tonenke the Russian offensive continued in the direction of Umanske and Yasnobrodivka, which is the work of the 6th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division, recently reinforced by the 428th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (mobilized men from Bashkortostan, attached to this division), together with the 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps. The Russians managed to occupy positions along the fifth \"longitudinal\" forest belt west of Tonenke, getting less than 1 km from the first houses of Umanske (those in the part of the settlement located south of Durna). In this area the Russians are carrying out continuous armored/mechanized attacks, aiming to advance into the open fields between the tree lines and approach the two villages mentioned above. They have had successes, although at great cost in terms of men and gear; moreover, rumors that they have entered Umanske are categorically false as of today and also denied by Russian channels with contacts with their soldiers in the field. The area north of Pervomaiske is a large gray area according to both sides; as of last week there was still Ukrainian presence in the area but it\u2019s likely that the Ukrainians have withdrawn, while the Russians still need to consolidate gains there.\n\nA grouping of the Air Assault Forces is working to halt the Russians in this area: the 25th Airborne Brigade, the 71st Jager Brigade (arrived over the recent days from the northern flank of Avdiivka) and the 78th Air Assault Regiment (transferred in recent weeks from the Orikhiv sector), along with the 53rd Mech Brigade. \n\nDuring 2024, the 9th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (the \u201cSomalia\u201d Assault Battalion of the 1st Corps became a battalion of this brigade, which is also supported by the \u201cSparta\u201d Recon Battalion of the 1st Corps) managed to take over the entire village of Pervomaiske, advancing 6 kms along the village since December 2023, when they were still only a few hundred meters away from the famous \"Republica Mist\" checkpoint established in the ATO/JFO times. \n\nIn the last week the Russians have managed to take all the houses both north of Staroavdeevskiy Stavok (i.e. the territory of the hamlet of Vodiane) and south (i.e. the houses along Pershotravneva Street), after very hard house-to-house battles against the 1st Rifle Battalion of the Ukrainian 59th Motorized Brigade. Now the Russians are moving in the direction of Netailove, which defense is beginning. Earlier this week they managed to advance a few hundred meters into the marshy area between Pervomaiske and Netailove. Elements of the 109th TDF Brigade arrived in the area recently.\n\nThe rapid advances in Pervomaiske were also aided by the fact that the bulk of the 59th Motorized Brigade is now concentrated in Nevelske, a little to the south. The latter village is being attacked by the 110th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps, which had managed to enter the village, after approaching it from the east and south. Last week a counterattack by the 59th Motorized Brigade drove the Russians out of the village, which is situated in the heights and which control is important. The 59th Brigade is supported by the 198th Battalion of the 111th TDF Brigade. \n\nMarinka sector. Over the past week, attacks have resumed against Krasnohorivka, an important Ukrainian stronghold in the area, defended by elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade and of the 109th TDF Brigade. As early as late February the Russians tried to attack the town, initially with limited success and then being driven out by elements of the 3rd Assault Brigade quickly rushed there. A relative of a missing soldier of the 5th Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) had named Krasnohorivka the \"Bermuda Triangle\" because of the large number of MIAs the unit had there. \n\nThis week the 5th Motorized Brigade attacked from the south (Marinka) and elements of the 110th Motorized Brigade from the east (Staromykhailivka) - this is the assault in which the famous \u201cturtle tank\u201d took part. The Russian assault groups succeeded in capturing several houses both south of the Donetsk-Kurachove railway and north of it, after managing to occupy several Ukrainian trenches to the east of the town, as well as taking the town\u2019s cemetery and some industrial buildings in the south-eastern part of the town (along Vatunina Street), with the aim of reaching the large brick factory.\n\nThe 46th Airmobile Brigade has succeeded, in the last weeks, in halting Russian attacks against Heorhiivka by the 103rd Motorized Regiment and elements of the 68th and of the 163rd Tank Regiments of the 150th Motorized Division (8th CAA, SMD), which have been attacking from both the sides of the lake formed by the Osikova River, despite some Russian rumors that they had entered the center of the village. \n\nFurther south, after several counterattacks, the 33rd Mech Brigade and elements of the 23rd Mech Brigade (to which the 425th Separate Assault Battalion \u201cSkala\u201d was attached) managed to stabilize the lines around Pobjeda (which is in Russian hands), preventing further advance by the 20th Motorized Division (8th CAA). \n\nThere are Russian successes in Novomykhailivka, however. To the north of the village, in late March the 10th Tank Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division (transferred here from Avdiivka several weeks ago) captured the industrial area north of the village and several tree lines further north. \n\nIn the center of the village, the progress of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet, supported by the 430th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, goes on: over 1 km during the recent weeks along Centralna Street, as well as having captured a part of the dachas area located north of the Novomikhailovsky Stavok. According to Ukrainian statements, the Ukrainians currently control about a quarter of the village.\n\nSouth-west of Novomykhailivka, last week the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps of the Eastern MD (supported by the 1472nd Regiment of the Territorial Forces) captured an Ukrainian trench system, complicating things for the Ukrainians in the Novomykhailivka, the area of which is defended by the 79th Air Assault Brigade with support by elements of the TDF (particularly the 116th TDF Brigade). The 79th Brigade has been doing a tremendous work for months and months and destroying a lot of Russian armored vehicles, despite the difficulties.\n\nSouth of Novomykhailivka, elements of the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA (EMD) have recently entered the field. However, the Russians have been weakened in this area, with the 39th Brigade concentrated near Novomykhailivka, and have no longer been able to advance in the direction of the Kostyantynivka-Vuhledar Road and Vodiane, thanks to the work of elements of the 72nd and of the 31st Mech Brigades.

But most of these men are in need of medical care and cannot be deployed in combat. After the command's insistence there was some sort of mutiny, with numerous refusals, and these men were locked in their barracks for a day.

It\u2019s not easy to have a constantly updated understading of the lines in this sector due to a certain lack of geolocations, but as I understand it, at some point after mid-March the 71st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Division (58th CAA, SMD) managed to occupy the very large trenches system south of Robotyne, built by the Russians and occupied by the Ukrainians in September 2023. Together with the rest of the 42nd Motorized Division (which is supported by several regiments of the Territorial Forces, primarily the 1152nd) and elements of the 76th VDV Division, they managed to enter Robotyne, occupying positions in what remains of the south-western part of the village.

So just because they had say 10k BMPs in storage doesn&#39;t mean they can reactivate and operate that many, large quantities need to be stripped for parts, and many were so badly stored they are effectively scrap at this point. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m convinced the Russians have at most 2 more years in them around the current rate of attrition, probably less, before they exhaust most of their Soviet stockpile completely. Once Russia needs to replace their losses entirely with new production, they&#39;re going to be in a world of hurt.</p>\n</div>",

But deterrence isn't just about the strength of the military. If the government isn't willing to use it, or at least doesn't appear to be, then the strength of the military becomes irrelevant.\n\nI think this comment really hit the nail on the head regarding the implications of what is happening in Ukraine and the message it's sending to Taiwan.\n\nIt also brings up a very good point: what's the point of military strength if there's a lack of political will to use it. \n\nI have more thought on this, and will update this comment over the next 2 hours below the fold as I work through my own head space: \n\n------\n\nEDITS:\n\nThere's been a lot of ink spilled on what Taiwan needs militarily as well as what advantages the PLA has over Taiwan, so I won't go into that. I can direct you to several different posts from several different users if you want them that looks at the current balance of forces outside of the triumphalist take of the gen pop, r/ncd, and the broader OSINT/NAFO twitter crowds.\n\nIn almost all of those accounting of the military balance, one thing is made clear: without the US becoming physically embroiled in a war with the PRC during a Taiwan scenario, Taiwan stands no chance alone. \n\nFor the US, we will also need the assistance of additional allied forces to achieve the force concentration/fires density needed to begin eroding PLA combat power as a whole in vicinity of the Taiwan Strait. Right now, I see the current war in Ukraine as communicating several things to both China and Taiwan:\n\n1. The US is hesitant to engage in direct combat **at scale** against the forces of a nuclear power \n2. The US does not wish to escalate the fighting against said nuclear power engaging in direct combat with an allied force.\n\nThese are both important to Taiwan, because the first suggests that the US may be hesitant to start shooting at PLA forces attacking Taiwan in the event of a war. The second suggests that the US will want to impose limits on Taiwan striking at targets in the mainland to erode PLA fighting abilities. So let's talk a bit about both points:\n\n**Potential US hesitation to shoot at PLA:** \n\nDespite [triumphalist takes on Twitter](https://twitter.com/John_A_Ridge/status/1778085345239708098) from OSINTers who are neither part of the MIC nor a part of the armed forces, and despite active duty member's own desire to see those effects achieved, the general consensus in the higher echelons (i.e. strategic decisionmakers) of our government is that we would want to avoid war due to the potentials of nuclear escalation (i.e. everybody loses, but who loses the least?) and the challenge the PRC industrial capacity poses to our own. \n\nWe've heard multiple heads of different service branches warn that the PLA is not a pushover, and that they are closing the gap--big as it may be--faster than we are comfortable with. While some of it can be handwaved away as the service branches fighting each other for budgetary reasons, the *idea* that the PLA will be our next biggest adversary is starting to gel within the broader military community and among strategic decisionmakers. \n\nDue to the messaging, the general consensus seems to be: ***we're not ready to fight the PLA... yet***, and that plays a factor into broadcasting the message that the US might hesitate to shoot back if China were to do something *right now*. The ironic thing is, China doesn't feel that it's ready to confront the US either, despite triumphalist takes from their own OSINTers and PLA fanboys. This hesitation and belief in the decisionmakers results in the following:\n\n- Taiwan is much more hesitant to seek de jure independence, preferring to delay by using de facto independence while shifting their strategic posture to fight a sufficiently long delaying battle against PLA forces mustering across the Strait.\n - This is working somewhat, but their reliance on US equipment as part of their procurement strategy means delays in shipping the weapons they've been asking for from us\n- China is much more hesitant to launch an outright op, preferring to use economic coercion to force greater economic ties until they can more or less \"buy\" Taiwan outright while continuing force build up to keep closing the gap with the US\n - This is working very well for them, as their industrial capacity and largely closed MIC ecosystem allows them to build up faster than we can\n- US is much more hesitant to encourage Taiwan de jure independence, preferring to invest and build up forces to re-widen the gap before we change our posture toward Taiwan.\n - This is not working as well for us, because naval procurement is a mess, and air force faces the crucial problem of relying on logistical nodes that are increasingly under threat\n\n**US not wishing for Taiwan to attack PRC targets if war happens:**\n\nThis is a point that gets argued a lot about Ukraine striking Russian energy infrastructure, and it isn't inconceivable that the US may do the same for Taiwan. The escalation pathway that is most likely to happen is that once Taiwan starts hitting PRC targets, it gives ammo for PRC propaganda, which then can deepen the support for war from the civilian population. \n\nThere's a reason why China continues to portray the US as this bloodthirsty monster capable of wrecking havoc that--in popular diction--\"goes hard and makes the US look badass.\" It prepares their civilian population for the idea that if their civil-military targets are struck, it's not because of PLA incompetency but because the US is *just that good* and that the US is helping Taiwan achieve these effects. \n\nIn other words, it doesn't invalidate any of the expectations for the population and can help them build the 'rally-around-the-flag' effect to increase civilian support. It's not going to be \"the CCP led a disastrous campaign that killed your only son\" but \"look at how the Taiwanese traitors murdered your only son on behalf of their American masters with American help.\" Some people might not buy that messaging, but the majority will, and that's all that matters.\n\nI believe that our decisionmakers are *aware* of this particular approach from the PRC and that this will give them incentive to rein in Taiwan from striking targets in the PRC if war does indeed break out. Taiwan will certainly not see it this way, which is why they have little incentive to purchase more American missile products and are in favor of building up their own sizable missile force. It's so that they can retain some degree of autonomy in a military campaign - i.e. \"this weapon is Taiwanese made, not American, so we will use it as we see fit.\" \n\nThis creates a problem for *us* because if Taiwan starts hitting Chinese targets and China blames the US for it, then it risks China being incentivized to start hitting US targets. A strike on CONUS sets us on a path of escalation that is very risky, so we are incentivized to either stop it from happening or mitigating the risks to ourselves. \n\nIn other words, the interests aren't *entirely* aligned between Taiwan and the US, other than the fact that China is a threat to Taiwan. How Taiwan wishes to carry out a war and how the US wishes to carry out a war is different, and Taiwan is watching US actions in Ukraine to see if the same successes and failures might apply to them.",

                "body": "I think given Ukraine's quite unique pragmatic willingness to receive aid, they will do well in any post war future where they can at least freeze the conflict. Even if sending huge big ticket aid to Ukraine becomes difficult, simply receiving a normal trickle of aid and sympathy from people will help them hugely in rebuilding. They could have something similar to post war South Korea. The aid they received was not in the form one massive Marshall Plan injection, but they consistently were favored by the US and it helped them immensely, eventually setting the conditions that turned them into an economic powerhouse. I think it would be difficult to argue that this would have happened if they hadn't so clearly been favored by US interests.\n\nIf Ukraine wins, especially regaining their borders, it would also be difficult to overstate how much the national identity would be shaped by the struggle they just went through. The struggle for independence has certainly imbued Ukraine already with a national sense of urgency and a desire to reform.

Even if sending huge big ticket aid to Ukraine becomes difficult, simply receiving a normal trickle of aid and sympathy from people will help them hugely in rebuilding. They could have something similar to post war South Korea. The aid they received was not in the form one massive Marshall Plan injection, but they consistently were favored by the US and it helped them immensely, eventually setting the conditions that turned them into an economic powerhouse. I think it would be difficult to argue that this would have happened if they hadn&#39;t so clearly been favored by US interests.</p>\n\n<p>If Ukraine wins, especially regaining their borders, it would also be difficult to overstate how much the national identity would be shaped by the struggle they just went through.

The choice isn't Egypt or Iran, it's Iran or Egypt\u00a0*and*\u00a0Iran.\n\nOn the surface of things this is true and I agree with you. More fighter sales will breed more fighter production. We probably agree on more of this than we disagree, but in my mind it's really not that simple when it comes to *how Iran got these fighters in particular.* There are unintended consequences borne out of trying to squash sales on this principle and it's those consequences that I'm discussing. \n\nI really don't think it was a choice of Egypt *and* Iran. Iran being an export partner was never a guarantee and wasn't even considered back during the initial offer or even after the US squashed the original export to Egypt. Russia only considered selling the jets to Iran after dragging their feet in negotiations for military support in the middle of a war. Military support that was the equivalent of Russia scraping the bottom of the barrel alongside NK to ensure it had wartime partners and much needed supplies.\n\nBy squashing the Egypt export we left Russia with a giftbag of 24 readymade Su-35S which sat in storage for years. You don't leave 24 unpaid for and expensive jets sat on the tarmac if you've got a partner you were intending to sell them to anyway sitting in the wings.

This alongside the long list of other concerns ranging from political repercussions to issues as simple and problematic as payment, Iran isn't exactly a safe bet for a multibillion dollar arms package, are yet more likely reasons they weren't included in the original export partners. \n\nNow we could argue that it is still preferential to limit exports to other nations, regardless of the consequences later down the road, and on that point I do partially agree, the wider suppression of Su-35 sales was largely successful and CAATSA whilst having consequences in the diplomatic space that I would argue were extremely damaging did what it said on the tin from the American perspective, it was very effective in the short term and achieved its initial goals.   \n  \nBut in this case in particular there are clearly consequences and we need to be careful to avoid similar situations in the future.

You don't just immediately transfer jets to another country, Ukraine's F16 process for example has taken a great deal of time to get to this stage and we're still a ways off from seeing fruit from that tree and that's coming from a country that has a much more pressing need and urgency to complete the training and integration as quickly as possible as well as vastly more comprehensive support from partner nations.\n\nIsrael is bogged down in a conflict, as are Russia, I don't think either of them care too much on a purely pragmatic level outside of whatever they tell the press whether Iran gets these Su-35S. Israel's AD and its own air force is more than capable in complexity, training, operational experience and sheer scale to engage and nullify those jets should they become operational and this is assuming Israel don't pre-emptively remove them in a more conclusive manner as they have done in the past with other Iranian threats.\n\nWe might see political statements and theatrical back and forth commentary on the issue that plays to the domestic audiences in either country as well as the wider global stage. No politician is going to look at a steak dinner and turn it down and I would expect nothing less, but that's as far as I think it will go. \n\nI don't think that this aircraft transfer will be some straw that breaks the camels back moment, it's been and gone, the trainers are in Iran, the deal is signed, pilots are training as we speak. If Israel were going to kick up a fuss they would have done so when the trainers were transferred and when they had much more political opportunity and breathing room outside of this current conflict.",

More fighter sales will breed more fighter production.

            "body": "You're correct on the vulnerabilities. I've seen plenty of comments joking about ERA and adhoc armour placement seen by Ukrainians and Russian tank crews alike, mocking the hardware and using it as a reference point to how vulnerable the T-72/62/64/80 etc are when it comes to loitering munitions and FPV threats.\n\nBut this is hardly exclusive to older ex-Soviet and Russian tank types.\n\nNone of our tanks were designed to deal with this new threat vector either and there isn't any one silver bullet solution that will adequately protect them. APS for example is a welcome addition, but hardly a catch all solution given the extreme prevalence of FPV threats.\n\n>Specifically for the war in Ukraine its strangely seem to make sense to bring back heavily protected casemate style assault guns to fulfill the role of tanks. As long range frontine fire support the lack of a turret might not be a big deal, especially since it means the top and sides can be much better protected.\n\nIt's possible this might be explored. The issue you have with these casemate style assault guns is that they would be heavy, expensive and less flexible. it's the flexibility of modern tanks which has allowed them to remain a staple for so long. You'd risk minimizing the advantages that modern tanks have that make them so useful on the Battlefield.\n\nUkraine is also demonstrating that heavier tanks is not necessarily a good thing, a large number of tank losses are occurring when tanks get stuck in the mud and require recovery. Not something you want to attempt whilst under the enemies FPV and ATGM umbrella.\n\nThe biggest issues tanks face currently in my mind are three fold:\n\n* Weak top armour and adhoc mitigation against drone based threats. (mitigation can be solved using improved SHORAD, EW and other means, but the underlying weak top armour is here to stay. It's a design consideration going back several generations and 3-4 decades at this point and even new models of western tanks are failing to address this concern adequately).\n* Poor Battlefield manoeuvrability. By this I mean they are extremely limited in how they approach enemy positions, the prevalence of minefields force them to travel in columns behind limited engineering vehicles, easy targets for massed FPV strikes and guided artillery. A solution to this would be to greatly increase the prevalence of mine trawling kits and make them a feature, not a rarity, of all tanks in all pushes. Pushing in extremely narrow and predictable routes is suicide in the modern and hyper visible battlespace. Allowing your enemy to focus on one or two exposed columns at a time instead of splitting their focus more widely has had predictable results for both sides.\n* Weight. With additional protection and capability typically comes additional weight and this is a huge mixed bag for future tank considerations, particularly if you expect the tank will have to fight in anything but perfectly dry and stable conditions. Russian tanks are lighter and less protected by design, coming in sometimes nearly a full third lighter than Western tank designs and yet even they have struggled sometimes in this terrain.

I&#39;ve seen plenty of comments joking about ERA and adhoc armour placement seen by Ukrainians and Russian tank crews alike, mocking the hardware and using it as a reference point to how vulnerable the T-72/62/64/80 etc are when it comes to loitering munitions and FPV threats.</p>\n\n<p>But this is hardly exclusive to older ex-Soviet and Russian tank types.</p>\n\n<p>None of our tanks were designed to deal with this new threat vector either and there isn&#39;t any one silver bullet solution that will adequately protect them. APS for example is a welcome addition, but hardly a catch all solution given the extreme prevalence of FPV threats.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Specifically for the war in Ukraine its strangely seem to make sense to bring back heavily protected casemate style assault guns to fulfill the role of tanks. As long range frontine fire support the lack of a turret might not be a big deal, especially since it means the top and sides can be much better protected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s possible this might be explored. The issue you have with these casemate style assault guns is that they would be heavy, expensive and less flexible. it&#39;s the flexibility of modern tanks which has allowed them to remain a staple for so long. You&#39;d risk minimizing the advantages that modern tanks have that make them so useful on the Battlefield.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is also demonstrating that heavier tanks is not necessarily a good thing, a large number of tank losses are occurring when tanks get stuck in the mud and require recovery. Not something you want to attempt whilst under the enemies FPV and ATGM umbrella.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest issues tanks face currently in my mind are three fold:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weak top armour and adhoc mitigation against drone based threats. (mitigation can be solved using improved SHORAD, EW and other means, but the underlying weak top armour is here to stay. It&#39;s a design consideration going back several generations and 3-4 decades at this point and even new models of western tanks are failing to address this concern adequately).</li>\n<li>Poor Battlefield manoeuvrability. By this I mean they are extremely limited in how they approach enemy positions, the prevalence of minefields force them to travel in columns behind limited engineering vehicles, easy targets for massed FPV strikes and guided artillery. A solution to this would be to greatly increase the prevalence of mine trawling kits and make them a feature, not a rarity, of all tanks in all pushes. Pushing in extremely narrow and predictable routes is suicide in the modern and hyper visible battlespace. Allowing your enemy to focus on one or two exposed columns at a time instead of splitting their focus more widely has had predictable results for both sides.</li>\n<li>Weight. With additional protection and capability typically comes additional weight and this is a huge mixed bag for future tank considerations, particularly if you expect the tank will have to fight in anything but perfectly dry and stable conditions. Russian tanks are lighter and less protected by design, coming in sometimes nearly a full third lighter than Western tank designs and yet even they have struggled sometimes in this terrain. It will be interesting to see if more formal and heavier modifications are encouraged or avoided based on this reality. A stationary tank is a dead one.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

The conclusion then is that bore size has little impact. Rather you should be considerate of the precision of milling the barrel, the coefficient of drag of the penetrator, and the capability of the targeting electronics to deal with variable atmospheric conditions.",

However, due to the higher coefficient of drag of their (low-density) long-rods, they bleed speed much more rapidly and hence they&#39;ve not had great performance as a sniper anti-vehicular platform. The conclusion then is that bore size has little impact. Rather you should be considerate of the precision of milling the barrel, the coefficient of drag of the penetrator, and the capability of the targeting electronics to deal with variable atmospheric conditions.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I made a comment outlining these risks nearly half a year ago before the winter campaigns began in earnest. This has been an obvious outcome to anyone actually paying attention. Power infrastructure is a very dry topic and reading into it isn't the most glamourous way to spend your time compared to procurement reports and actual battlefield movements, that being said this is arguably the most critical situation Ukraine is facing right now outside of perhaps manpower, I would argue it tops even that. \n\nUkraine's TPP infrastructure in particular saw the lowest rates of repair after the first winter campaign, **recovering only 15% of their lost generation capacity after the winter**. Now with these further more definitive strikes, Ukraine is essentially left with a very fragile balance of remaining TPP generation westward (which is limited, the majority of their TPP plants were in the east of the country), Hydro plants (which have relatively small capacities and are now also being struck and permanently destroyed) and Nuclear plants (unlikely to be attacked directly, but the majority of their production capacity is transferred through vulneraeble arterial networks around Ukraine.\n\nIt's not entirely correct to characterize, as many have done, Russia's previous attacks against power infrastructure as non-destructive. However the balance between substation and direct generation attacks has definitely shifted. Russia was always open to destroying the generating infrastructure, they just saw it as easier to sever the arterial networks. Now that Russia has deeper inventories, more experience and Ukrainian AD is stretched thin trying to counter Glide Bombing threats on the front lines, they are able to more confidently directly strike the generating equipment itself. \n\nThis is not a good position for Ukraine and if Russia chooses to continue ratcheting up the pressure it will not be long until the country reaches breaking point. There are solutions in the interim to deal with short term blackouts that Ukraine could employ, power schedules, mobile generators and the like, but those are all bandaids and progressively lose effectiveness the wider scale the problem is. \n\nThere are several remaining targets of opportunity that Russia could strike to further worsen the problem: \n\n**Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP)**\n\nKremenchuk HPP for a start, the generating infrastructure is extremely exposed. You've also got Kaniv and Dniester which Russia began targeting several weeks ago. Kyiv HPP is also a potential target although I wonder if Trypilska was hit because it was easier to strike a facility outside of Kyiv proper.\n\n**Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity (PSH)**\n\nUkraine has several Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity plants, these rely upon utilizing excess generating capacity to pump water which is becoming increasingly hard to achieve but they also represent some of the easiest targets for attacks. Dniester PSH is very vulnerable and also next door to Dniester HPP which has already been attacked. It's highly likely we see both facilities targeted in the coming months. Tashlyk is also a viable target but it's proximity to the nearby Nuclear Power Plant make it unlikely for Russia to prioritize in the short term.\n\n**Thermal Power Plants (TPP)** \n\nThermal power plants have bore the brunt of Russia's strikes largely because they were the highest nameplate generating capacities outside of Nuclear power. They also represented the easiest to strike targets. Ontop of this many of Ukraine's original high capacity TPP's were situated in the East and occupied by Russian forces in the earlier days of the war, leaving a variety of smaller plants further westward which were already in the process of being mothballed and retired to try and pick up the differential with whatever generators they still had operational. \n\nOf these there are a few notable remaining TPP's that are likely to be struck: \n\n- Burshtyn - Already struck in 2022 this plant has a relatively large installed capacity which is crucial to preventing widespread rolling blackouts. This is highly likely to be struck in the coming months. Losing the remaining capacity of this plant will be extremely significant to Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n- Ladyzhyn - Already struck in 2022 and further in 2023, some units remain in operation and are likely targets. \n\n- Dobrotvir - Already struck in 2022, one unit critically damaged. 3 units still operational.\n\nThese three plants are highly likely to be struck in my view, they represent some of Ukraine's last remaining TPP plants with operational capacity, Burshtyn especially would cause the largest drop in generating capacity. It's location makes it a tough target but Russia has already demonstrated the ability to strike this plant in 2022.\n\nHope this has helped for anyone wanting to learn more about the energy infrastructure strikes and why Ukraine was never really out of the woods on this issue, even if Russia's strikes lulled.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I made a comment outlining these risks nearly half a year ago before the winter campaigns began in earnest. This has been an obvious outcome to anyone actually paying attention. Power infrastructure is a very dry topic and reading into it isn&#39;t the most glamourous way to spend your time compared to procurement reports and actual battlefield movements, that being said this is arguably the most critical situation Ukraine is facing right now outside of perhaps manpower, I would argue it tops even that. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s TPP infrastructure in particular saw the lowest rates of repair after the first winter campaign, <strong>recovering only 15% of their lost generation capacity after the winter</strong>. Now with these further more definitive strikes, Ukraine is essentially left with a very fragile balance of remaining TPP generation westward (which is limited, the majority of their TPP plants were in the east of the country), Hydro plants (which have relatively small capacities and are now also being struck and permanently destroyed) and Nuclear plants (unlikely to be attacked directly, but the majority of their production capacity is transferred through vulneraeble arterial networks around Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not entirely correct to characterize, as many have done, Russia&#39;s previous attacks against power infrastructure as non-destructive. However the balance between substation and direct generation attacks has definitely shifted. Russia was always open to destroying the generating infrastructure, they just saw it as easier to sever the arterial networks. Now that Russia has deeper inventories, more experience and Ukrainian AD is stretched thin trying to counter Glide Bombing threats on the front lines, they are able to more confidently directly strike the generating equipment itself. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a good position for Ukraine and if Russia chooses to continue ratcheting up the pressure it will not be long until the country reaches breaking point. There are solutions in the interim to deal with short term blackouts that Ukraine could employ, power schedules, mobile generators and the like, but those are all bandaids and progressively lose effectiveness the wider scale the problem is. </p>\n\n<p>There are several remaining targets of opportunity that Russia could strike to further worsen the problem: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kremenchuk HPP for a start, the generating infrastructure is extremely exposed. You&#39;ve also got Kaniv and Dniester which Russia began targeting several weeks ago. Kyiv HPP is also a potential target although I wonder if Trypilska was hit because it was easier to strike a facility outside of Kyiv proper.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity (PSH)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has several Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity plants, these rely upon utilizing excess generating capacity to pump water which is becoming increasingly hard to achieve but they also represent some of the easiest targets for attacks.

Burshtyn will be a tougher nut to crack due to its size, it's one of the larger varieties of Ukraine's TPP's, more akin to some of the older ex-Soviet varieties and those that were occupied by Russia in Donetsk and the east of Ukraine where the majority of Ukraine's larger TPP's were situated. \n\nBurshytn also has 10 generating units which poses a bit of a challenge as far as directly striking and permanently knocking out each individual unit, so another follow-up strike is highly likely. DTEK officials have outlined that several of the halls are entirely destroyed but haven't specified which units (for obvious reasons) so whatever capacity remains to be targeted is going to be a fraction of its total generating capacity (if DTEK are to be believed and their statement is extrapolated, there are potentially 4-5 units still in operation which is a sizeable generating capacity relative to smaller targets such as the HPPs). \n\nLadyzhyn has a much smaller number of generating units but power was recently restored, although the heat interchange equipment for the nearby town is considered irreparable and completely destroyed. Given Ladyzhyn is much smaller the likelihood that only a single reactor was lucky enough to survive the attack and is providing the power is very high in my opinion. I don't see follow up Russian strikes here as likely as long as Dniester/Kaniv HPP and PHS plants remain in operation. The potential capacity left to eliminate at Ladyzhyn is probably relatively small, around the 300MW mark, and that's assuming the remaining reactors are running at their boiler plate capacity which is unlikely given damage. That being said existing AD could be severely depleted, if Russia see an opportunity I doubt they'll pass it up even if the capacity is on the smaller side. \n\nBoth of these plants remain tempting targets and I'd expect another strike to occur at Burshtyn in the very near future, a DTEK official expressed frustration back on the 30th of March that the repairs (which they estimate will take 9mo/1yr for permanently damaged units) will simply be struck again and that local air defense systems continue to be inadequate (hard to argue with that given the damage). Also can't really blame them for being frustrated, they previously spent $110M amongst other funds to repair some of these units after their strikes in 2022, Russia essentially erased that progress overnight and it seems that their local AD did little to prevent the strike. \n\nRussian missile stocks, ISR and other key metrics have continued to improve and Ukraine's differential in contrast (in terms of the integrity of their AD network, missile stocks etc) has continued to worsen. I don't really see an easy out for them on this, either they're going to pull AD equipment from the front or from major (and politically popular) cities to defend their remaining infrastructure or they plan to limp along with Nuclear alone. Rock and hard place and decisions needed to be made on this a year ago, instead of after they lose huge swathes of generating capacity. \n\nThe reason I used the 2022 and 2023 dates of attack in my comment was to highlight that these plants have been constant targets and that more pragmatic Russian targeting of generating equipment has always been the case, just not as visible and effective as it is today.",

While there might be some small export restrictions, I believe that such groups have for a long time been funneling all sorts of goods from the US and Europe over to Ukraine, and if the drones you are producing are like most they wouldn't have explosives or anything on them until they reach the frontlines. So really you are just like any other person donating drones to Ukrainians, you could probably just ship them like normally.\n\nIf the folks at the frontline got your drones and found them worth the price, they might start diverting some of the money from private fundraising your way. There is little to no chance anyone in the US is going to get an explicit contract from the Ukrainian government, they just don't have the means to negotiate stuff with small agents with no production history like that, and what funds they do have are probably better off going to Ukrainian producers in country. But these aid groups really care most about getting effective drones as cheaply as possible and in as great numbers as possible, so if you made something compelling in that way you would likely get funding. Unless you found super significant cost reductions, you would be operating at cost though, because most Ukrainian companies making drones are pretty much doing just that to support the war effort.\n\nThat being said, I do think that US companies have failed not because cost effective drones can't be made here, it is because the design philosophies of US producers have had a fundamental mismatch to battlefield realities. US designs tend to be more expensive, trying to fill niche roles like heavy transport, relays, tethered watchtowers etc. During the GOTW the Cold War tendency for defense procurement towards stratospheric budget, high value, super optimized designs was further strengthened. What big companies make smaller drones in the US make dozens at a time, and at high cost, because they aren't primarily motivated by patriotism but securing something profitable.\n\nBut there is really no reason at all that someone in the US couldn't be making drones en mass and with cheaper, stripped down designs like are most desired. The key would be in actually procuring the machinery capable of making at least some of the components, and not simply assembling from off the shelf parts the way most do. For instance, if you invested in the machinery to make cheap electric motors, and controller chips, and then just used commercial batteries, you could bring unit costs down ridiculously low. Everyone loves to talk about how much cheaper components are made in China but there is really nothing special about China besides they have invested in the capital equipment, available to everyone really, and most of it automated to produce these parts. If you don't make any parts yourself then every little bit comes with a surcharge and the end result is far more expensive than necessary. And ultimately, if you were realistically considering this approach, final assembly could be done in Ukraine, and you could just be sending knock-down kits in high volumes, which you test and manufacture from the safety of the US, which does represent a value to the Ukrainians because their facilities are vulnerable.",

With solar energy each family can make their own electricity and reduce the stress to the national grid and power plants so these plants electricity can be redirected to factories. It's more simple too, with just solar cell, inverters and battery, family also can take advantage of the existing electric line system in their house, don't have to install a new one. The biggest concern is the solar radiation rate because as far as i know Eastern europe the amount of sunny days per year is low and these things are pretty expensive, especially if you are going to install them for millions of household",
