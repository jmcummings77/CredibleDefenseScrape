In October it was announced that \"the partial mobilization is complete\", there was no act or law actually cancelling the mobilization, and, of course, people continued to get mobilization notices. Are these \"extra\" mobilized counted against the 300k or not? We do not know.\n\n- If there'll be a second wave of mobilization, there might not be an official target, and it might just not be announced. The Russian government, from what we see, at least to some degree cares about the social processes inside the country, and does not want to scare the somewhat placated populace shitless the same way it did in September.\n\n- We have little idea how many Wagner mercenaries (and their rented convicts), LNR/DNR troops, \"volunteer\" battalions like those that regional governors were supposed to provide, \"national\" battalions like Rusich are in play, and what their comparative role with MO is. For example, Wagner (and since very recently, MO too) recruit uncounted thousands from prisons and there's no accounting of that. Is this mobilization? Maybe?\n\nIMO there's just no point in operating with these numbers. If you really wanted to estimate the number of men with AKs who are fighting against Ukraine right now, you just do not have many options, and all of them are pretty bad. You could go other routes, like counting appearing obituaries in Russian social networks, like Mediazona does, counting tanks in open-air Siberean warehouses from satellite imagery, FIRMS, Ukrainian estimates, etc etc\n\nWhat you should not do is base anything on numbers coming from Russian officials.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>As a Russian-language commentator I want to underline that the quality of these numbers is very, very low. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>300k number for the first mobilization wave was mentioned offhand by some officials and by Putin, but <em>no</em> official acts or laws mention any specific numbers, just that mobilization is in effect.</p></li>\n<li><p>Even if the 300k number applies, we have no idea what it applies to. In October it was announced that &quot;the partial mobilization is complete&quot;, there was no act or law actually cancelling the mobilization, and, of course, people continued to get mobilization notices. Are these &quot;extra&quot; mobilized counted against the 300k or not? We do not know.</p></li>\n<li><p>If there&#39;ll be a second wave of mobilization, there might not be an official target, and it might just not be announced. The Russian government, from what we see, at least to some degree cares about the social processes inside the country, and does not want to scare the somewhat placated populace shitless the same way it did in September.</p></li>\n<li><p>We have little idea how many Wagner mercenaries (and their rented convicts), LNR/DNR troops, &quot;volunteer&quot; battalions like those that regional governors were supposed to provide, &quot;national&quot; battalions like Rusich are in play, and what their comparative role with MO is. For example, Wagner (and since very recently, MO too) recruit uncounted thousands from prisons and there&#39;s no accounting of that. Is this mobilization? Maybe?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>IMO there&#39;s just no point in operating with these numbers.

It's a broad-ranging and quick moving discussion, as always it's well worth a listen if you have time. \n\nSome key takeaways:\n* The Russian Spring offensive has seemingly begun, he expects it to be much more underwhelming than most expect -> goal will be on retaking the Donbas, doesn't expect much fighting on other fronts. \n* Counterattacks by Russia towards Kupyansk and Lyman are probably the most important as they would enable another front against Slovyansk-Kramatorsk lines if/when Bakhmut falls.\n* Kofman repeated that Bakhmut defense is in perilous position after the loss of Soledar, says Ukraine have strong fallback lines at Slovyansk-Kramatorsk and Russia would have little momentum.\n* He suggested that Ukraine actually was focused on preserving forces, most defenders of Bakhmut were TDF, National Guard, and Foreign Legion, i.e. expendable and they were backed up by some professional forces. Says both sides weren't sending their best to the fight. \n* Claims there's increasing evidence that Ukrainian brigades are fighting dispersed, in other words one battalion from a unit in one location and another elsewhere, makes getting sense of what units are committed where more difficult. \n* Reiterated that he's unsure of the state of Russian mobiks still in Russia: says they might have gotten 3 months of training, unsure if they will form new units or be replacements for battered units.\n* His take is that Russian minimum war aims are capture of Donbas, he sees this as being unlikely however. Expects best Russia can do is something similar to current lines of control. \n* Ukraine no longer has decisive manpower advantage, both sides have much higher density of forces now that lines are shorter than earlier phases of war. \n* Russian infrastructure strike campaign hasn't been particularly successful at least in part due to warmer weather. Russian strikes are now down to about 1 salvo per month, likely based on number of missiles they can produce every month.\n* Kofman's hierarchy of Ukrainian military needs: more ADS and artillery ammo, more advanced IFVs/APCs, more precision strike capabilities (artillery and BM), better training.\n* He downplayed advantage of Western tanks, said Western IFVs and APCs much better comparatively and more needed. \n* Biggest advantage of recently announced Western aid is not that they will be used in Spring offensive, but that Ukraine knows any losses they suffer in coming months will be backfilled by Western equipment. \n* Thinks Gerasimov replaced Surovikin by arguing to Putin that Russia could go back on the offensive instead of remaining in a defensive posture while it reconstituted itself and stockpiled ammo. Kofman was dismissive of Gerasimov as a commander and thinks his rushed offensive will go poorly. \n* Lengthy discussions of cluster munitions and the potential of nuclear escalation that I won't sum up here.",

One of the biggest issues with the Kharkiv offensive from the Russian perspective is that most of the units in the area were dramatically understaffed (less than 50% readiness, some as low as 25%) and stretched way too thin.

Because I seem to recall all sorts of talk about all sorts of maneuver brigades. \n\nFor example: \n\n*The Ukrainian brigades in and around Bakhmut\u2014the 60th and 71st Infantry Brigades, the 24th, 57th and 58th Mechanized Brigades, the 4th Tank Brigade, the 46th Air Mobile Brigade, the 128th Mountain Brigade and others\u2014represent the best of Kyiv\u2019s active army, which in 10 months of hard fighting has bulked up with new and heavier weapons while also translating extensive battlefield experience into better tactics and small-unit leadership.*   \n[*https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/12/22/bakhmut-is-soaked-in-blood-****as-eight-of-ukraines-best-brigades****-battle-40000-former-russian-prisoners/?sh=5371063b6f23*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/12/22/bakhmut-is-soaked-in-blood-as-eight-of-ukraines-best-brigades-battle-40000-former-russian-prisoners/?sh=5371063b6f23) \n\nAre we to believe these were lies? Errors? Whoops, Forbes misidentifed about ten brigades in that article alone, not counting every other media outlet and the UAF themselves giving updates for months? \n\nLet's talk about [this](https://militaryland.net/news/ukrainian-reinforcements-heading-to-donbas/), because I had discussed the 93rd in particular for months, one of Ukraine's best brigades, and how it it was surprising when they got rotated INTO Bakhmut to begin with, because the dangers associated with using up an offensively capable unit in defensive meat grinder fight. But then it got rotated out, per UAF press release. And we shouldn't wonder hard why, the UAF rotates units out of the operational theater because they're combat ineffective. Don't believe me, [here are members of the brigade saying it](https://mobile.twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1613028845459804160). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So if I'm thinking of the specific instance you're referring to, he said that he had been hearing complaints from some of his Ukrainian colleagues about trading professional troops for Wagner convicts around Bakhmut not that Kofman himself thought that was happening necessarily.\n\nHere is what he said: \n\n*But I have been hearing anecdotally a host of gripes and complaints* ***from Ukrainian colleagues*** *that they've accepted an attritional fight where they are trading better manpower, better people, for manpower that Russia can easily replace.*\n\nThat was Ukrainians telling Kofman that. \n\nBut now other Ukrainians are telling him and the rest of the media something else. \n\nWhich is that all the reporting from November to now was fake news. All the western media reports, all the soldiers' testimonies, the videos of Azov 3rd Assault Bde south of the city fighting, the craziness of the Soledar fighting with the 46th and what happened to them, all the Twitter and Telegram posts naming units, etc. All of that was LIES. \n\nInstead, the reality is the UAF GenStab brilliantly preserved their maneuver brigade strength by deliberately using TDF, NG, and NP as cannon fodder (again). \n\nThat's a load of crap, its just gaslighting. So why are they doing it? \n\nThey're trying to rewrite the history of Bakhmut while the ink is still wet to try to save face, mainly so short term morale isn't hindered with worries that they blew their load in Bakhmut while still losing ground left and right. \n\nAnd they did the the exact same thing in Severondonetsk over the late summer and early fall, rewriting the narrative despite all the previous reporting that it wasn't remotely mostly TDF. They even partially succeeded in tricking me until I actually went back and reread some of the articles about the battle the other day trying to identify units other than TDF. And sure enough, a bunch of numbered/named UAF maneuver brigades were described in the fight, taking heavy losses, etc. Liar liar, pants on fire.  \n\nWorst of all, and this part is sickening to me, the UA propaganda services are not trying to do the simplest thing and just suggest the heavy casualties in Bakhmut are just inflated and wrong. Instead, they're accepting heavy casualties but trying distort where they came from. Did they use better maneuver units to hold a city that Zelensky said would *\"change the tragic story of our war for independence and of freedom\"*? Nope, instead we're supposed to buy that Zaluzhnyi and the GenStab, again, deliberately did to the TDF, National Guard, and National Police, what Prigozhin did to Wagner excons. When Wagner did it to prisoners, it was universally decried as wasteful, callous, disgusting, etc. Whereas when Ukraine does it to TDF volunteers, to the UAF brass that's a good excuse. I'm seeing some similarities here. And I'm really disgusted by the fact that the \"good guys\" think this narrative is more appealing than the truth.\n\nAnd don't even bring up OPSEC being the reason.

Because I seem to recall all sorts of talk about all sorts of maneuver brigades. </p>\n\n<p>For example: </p>\n\n<p><em>The Ukrainian brigades in and around Bakhmut\u2014the 60th and 71st Infantry Brigades, the 24th, 57th and 58th Mechanized Brigades, the 4th Tank Brigade, the 46th Air Mobile Brigade, the 128th Mountain Brigade and others\u2014represent the best of Kyiv\u2019s active army, which in 10 months of hard fighting has bulked up with new and heavier weapons while also translating extensive battlefield experience into better tactics and small-unit leadership.</em><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/12/22/bakhmut-is-soaked-in-blood-as-eight-of-ukraines-best-brigades-battle-40000-former-russian-prisoners/?sh=5371063b6f23\"><em>https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/12/22/bakhmut-is-soaked-in-blood-</em><strong><em>as-eight-of-ukraines-best-brigades</em></strong><em>-battle-40000-former-russian-prisoners/?sh=5371063b6f23</em></a> </p>\n\n<p>Are we to believe these were lies? Errors? Whoops, Forbes misidentifed about ten brigades in that article alone, not counting every other media outlet and the UAF themselves giving updates for months? </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s talk about <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/news/ukrainian-reinforcements-heading-to-donbas/\">this</a>, because I had discussed the 93rd in particular for months, one of Ukraine&#39;s best brigades, and how it it was surprising when they got rotated INTO Bakhmut to begin with, because the dangers associated with using up an offensively capable unit in defensive meat grinder fight. But then it got rotated out, per UAF press release. And we shouldn&#39;t wonder hard why, the UAF rotates units out of the operational theater because they&#39;re combat ineffective. Don&#39;t believe me, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1613028845459804160\">here are members of the brigade saying it</a>. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So if I&#39;m thinking of the specific instance you&#39;re referring to, he said that he had been hearing complaints from some of his Ukrainian colleagues about trading professional troops for Wagner convicts around Bakhmut not that Kofman himself thought that was happening necessarily.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is what he said: </p>\n\n<p><em>But I have been hearing anecdotally a host of gripes and complaints</em> <strong><em>from Ukrainian colleagues</em></strong> <em>that they&#39;ve accepted an attritional fight where they are trading better manpower, better people, for manpower that Russia can easily replace.</em></p>\n\n<p>That was Ukrainians telling Kofman that. </p>\n\n<p>But now other Ukrainians are telling him and the rest of the media something else. </p>\n\n<p>Which is that all the reporting from November to now was fake news. All the western media reports, all the soldiers&#39; testimonies, the videos of Azov 3rd Assault Bde south of the city fighting, the craziness of the Soledar fighting with the 46th and what happened to them, all the Twitter and Telegram posts naming units, etc. All of that was LIES. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, the reality is the UAF GenStab brilliantly preserved their maneuver brigade strength by deliberately using TDF, NG, and NP as cannon fodder (again). </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a load of crap, its just gaslighting. So why are they doing it? </p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re trying to rewrite the history of Bakhmut while the ink is still wet to try to save face, mainly so short term morale isn&#39;t hindered with worries that they blew their load in Bakhmut while still losing ground left and right. </p>\n\n<p>And they did the the exact same thing in Severondonetsk over the late summer and early fall, rewriting the narrative despite all the previous reporting that it wasn&#39;t remotely mostly TDF. They even partially succeeded in tricking me until I actually went back and reread some of the articles about the battle the other day trying to identify units other than TDF. And sure enough, a bunch of numbered/named UAF maneuver brigades were described in the fight, taking heavy losses, etc. Liar liar, pants on fire.  </p>\n\n<p>Worst of all, and this part is sickening to me, the UA propaganda services are not trying to do the simplest thing and just suggest the heavy casualties in Bakhmut are just inflated and wrong. Instead, they&#39;re accepting heavy casualties but trying distort where they came from. Did they use better maneuver units to hold a city that Zelensky said would <em>&quot;change the tragic story of our war for independence and of freedom&quot;</em>? Nope, instead we&#39;re supposed to buy that Zaluzhnyi and the GenStab, again, deliberately did to the TDF, National Guard, and National Police, what Prigozhin did to Wagner excons. When Wagner did it to prisoners, it was universally decried as wasteful, callous, disgusting, etc. Whereas when Ukraine does it to TDF volunteers, to the UAF brass that&#39;s a good excuse. I&#39;m seeing some similarities here. And I&#39;m really disgusted by the fact that the &quot;good guys&quot; think this narrative is more appealing than the truth.</p>\n\n<p>And don&#39;t even bring up OPSEC being the reason. If Forbes knew who was in the front lines, so did Russia.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "My thought is that NATO (and adjacent countries) are looking towards a lining up a steady stream of replacement tanks for Ukraine for 2024 and beyond. \n\nThe current strategy has been to supply replacement tanks from old Soviet stock or derivatives; mainly T-72 variations. However, those stocks are almost tapped out with only Poland still having two to three hundred T-72s and PT-91s left to give - of which 60 are promised already. \n\nThe drumbeat has been for Leopard 2s and Abram tanks. However, with the recent announcement we see how difficult it is to get them to Ukraine in significant numbers quickly. I know a lot of people here are on the Abrams for All train, but the idea that the US is going to send hundreds of Abrams and Bradleys and whatever other equipment in the next 18 months just isn't realistic. The US has its own obligations to itself and allies it has to manage. On the European side, we saw how quickly dozens of Leapords 2 commitments suddenly became not. \n\nThis is where the Leopard 1A5s come in. There are hundreds of them in surplus at FFG and Rheinmetall. They have to be reconditioned and repaired, but they're available to be sent as soon as that's done. There's no active units on them, or need for a ring swap. It's just time and money, both that are going back into the German economy so that's another boon for Germany. \n\nCurrent estimates are 20 refurbished and sent every 3 months. This isn't the best pace, but it also is a manageable one. With Poland sending their own tanks, the need for a massive number quickly is mitigated. Which is important because there's still a lot of logistics to figure out: ammo and parts for Germany, and training Ukrainians on new systems. By the slower pace these can be hammered out. \n\nThis next part is more a hope/what I'm thinking then anything I've seen, so take it for what you will. \n\nThere are still a lot of 1A5s in Europe that are stashed around in storage. I've no idea the condition, but to some extent it doesn't matter. The strategy should be to ramp up the ability to refurbish these tanks, and continue to get provide them in ever larger numbers.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My thought is that NATO (and adjacent countries) are looking towards a lining up a steady stream of replacement tanks for Ukraine for 2024 and beyond. </p>\n\n<p>The current strategy has been to supply replacement tanks from old Soviet stock or derivatives; mainly T-72 variations. However, those stocks are almost tapped out with only Poland still having two to three hundred T-72s and PT-91s left to give - of which 60 are promised already. </p>\n\n<p>The drumbeat has been for Leopard 2s and Abram tanks. However, with the recent announcement we see how difficult it is to get them to Ukraine in significant numbers quickly. I know a lot of people here are on the Abrams for All train, but the idea that the US is going to send hundreds of Abrams and Bradleys and whatever other equipment in the next 18 months just isn&#39;t realistic. The US has its own obligations to itself and allies it has to manage. On the European side, we saw how quickly dozens of Leapords 2 commitments suddenly became not. </p>\n\n<p>This is where the Leopard 1A5s come in. There are hundreds of them in surplus at FFG and Rheinmetall. They have to be reconditioned and repaired, but they&#39;re available to be sent as soon as that&#39;s done. There&#39;s no active units on them, or need for a ring swap. It&#39;s just time and money, both that are going back into the German economy so that&#39;s another boon for Germany. </p>\n\n<p>Current estimates are 20 refurbished and sent every 3 months. This isn&#39;t the best pace, but it also is a manageable one. With Poland sending their own tanks, the need for a massive number quickly is mitigated. Which is important because there&#39;s still a lot of logistics to figure out: ammo and parts for Germany, and training Ukrainians on new systems. By the slower pace these can be hammered out. </p>\n\n<p>This next part is more a hope/what I&#39;m thinking then anything I&#39;ve seen, so take it for what you will. </p>\n\n<p>There are still a lot of 1A5s in Europe that are stashed around in storage. I&#39;ve no idea the condition, but to some extent it doesn&#39;t matter. The strategy should be to ramp up the ability to refurbish these tanks, and continue to get provide them in ever larger numbers.

Most of them were essentially T-54 analogues.\n\nThe T-80BVM is one of Russia's best tanks today and it is superior in armour, firepower, optics, fire controls, and mobility.\n\n________\n\n\nThe T-72A had good armour protection for its time, but that was 1979. By 1991 the latest American munitions could frontally penetrate it out beyond 2000m. Its hull is three layers; steel, glass textolite, and more steel. The T-80BVM has essentially the same armour thickness and angle, but it is a five layer system found to be significantly more efficient, uses a much higher hardness steel, and is augmented by Relikt ERA. Worth noting that the latest/last Soviet armour is now known to have been frontally immune to the aforementioned M829A1 which was nicknamed the 'Silver Bullet' during Desert Storm, and the T-72B3, T-90A/M and T-80BVM are significantly improved from that point (that point being the T-72B Obr 1985/1889).\n\n^The turret armour is dependent on whether or not the individual tanks is updated from a T-80BV or T-80U, with the former having essentially the same \"Kverts\" turret armour filler as the T-72A but with Relikt ERA, and the latter having a much more capable system of internally layered NERA as well as Relikt ERA.\n\n\n\n\nThey have essentially the same gun in the sense that they use the same mounting points and ammunition dimensions, but that is about it. The harmonics, metallurgy, and supporting systems have all been significantly improved. So the 2A46M5 of the T-80BVM is about three times as accurate and can fire munitions with much greater penetration values. The increase in mechanical accuracy is especially relevant when you consider that it has thermals and fully computerized fire controls.\n\nOn optics they have limited overlap in that they have very similar IRNV systems available for the driver and commander, but the T-80BVM also has a 3rd gen thermal optic for the gunner (the commander has a duplicate image, but no thermals of his own) with digital zoom. The driver also has better periscopes, having the standard three periscopes compared to the T-72's weird system if just one giant periscope. (T-90M is known to have a thermal viewer for the commander too).\n\nFire controls are the largest disparity. The T-72A was the first Soviet tank to feature a laser range finder and automatic elevation adjustment, but that was about the limit of its fire controls. Oh, and it had a decent stabilizer. But the T-80BVM has a 3rd gen thermal optic, an atmospheric mast, and fully computerized adjustment including a 'third axis' stabilizer which would account for relative movement. The T-80BVM has essentially the same but better optics and fire controls as the M1A1 Abrams which is known to have severely overmatched the Iraqi tanks in 1991.\n\nFor mobility it is as simple as having a bigger and better engine. The T-72A uses the 780hp V-46-6 whereas the T-80BVM uses some improvement of the GTD-1250...you can guess the horsepower. The latter being a turbine is also just nicer and smoother, with nearly unlimited torque due to the necessity of a reduction gear.\n\n____________\n\nI know this reads like video game statistics, but these sorts of things can be relevant. If in 1991 the US invaded Iraq, and an M1A1 Abrams fired its M829A1 at a T-80U instead of a T-72A (equivalent), then it would likely not have penetrated. And if it fired back then it would have had a decent chance itself.",

        "body": "[How Russia Is Surviving the Tightening Grip on Its Oil Revenue](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/business/russia-oil-embargo.html)\n\n> Even as Russia continues producing about 10 million barrels of oil per day \u2014 making it the world\u2019s third-largest producer, after the United States and Saudi Arabia \u2014 the European oil ban and price cap adopted on Dec. 5 have recently curtailed the money its treasury derives from exports. In December, Russian oil export revenues were $12.6 billion, nearly $4 billion less than a year earlier, according to the I.E.A. estimates.\n\n> That\u2019s largely because Russian oil companies have to offer increasingly large discounts to a shrinking pool of buyers.\n\n> The trend appears to be persisting. The Russian government\u2019s revenue from oil and gas production and exports fell in January by 46 percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry said on Monday.\n\n> The difference between the prices of Brent, a global oil benchmark, and Urals, the main type of exported Russian crude, widened to about $40 per barrel in January, according to the energy data company Argus Media. That gap was just a few dollars before the war.\n\n> The Russian Finance Ministry has acknowledged the drop in oil revenues, saying last week that the average price of Urals in January was $49.50 a barrel, nearly half its price a year earlier.

In December, Russian oil export revenues were $12.6 billion, nearly $4 billion less than a year earlier, according to the I.E.A. estimates.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s largely because Russian oil companies have to offer increasingly large discounts to a shrinking pool of buyers.</p>\n\n<p>The trend appears to be persisting. The Russian government\u2019s revenue from oil and gas production and exports fell in January by 46 percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry said on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between the prices of Brent, a global oil benchmark, and Urals, the main type of exported Russian crude, widened to about $40 per barrel in January, according to the energy data company Argus Media. That gap was just a few dollars before the war.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian Finance Ministry has acknowledged the drop in oil revenues, saying last week that the average price of Urals in January was $49.50 a barrel, nearly half its price a year earlier. The ministry uses the Urals price to calculate its tax take from oil exports.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe windfall income will decline, and volumes of their receipts will become less predictable,\u201d the Finance Ministry said in a budget forecast late last year.</p>\n\n<p>To supporters of Russian oil sanctions, the Kremlin\u2019s ability to keep selling oil for less money is the intended outcome of the price cap.

The enemy is attacking from Ploschanka to Makiivka and from Kreminna along a significant length of the front.\n\n> \u25b6\ufe0f On the Bakhmut direction - enemy broke through part of the defense in the area of Blahodatne. The situation in Paraskoviyivka and Krasna Hora is not clear. In the city itself, the katsaps have a significant advantage in manpower, but our defenders not only hold the line, but also periodically inflict damage in the attack. No advances have been recorded south of the city, but the combat contact line is being refined there. \n\n> \u25b6\ufe0f On the Avdiivka direction - the enemy has partial success north of Opytne and has completely occupied Vodiane. In Maryinka, paratroopers destroyed one of the most advanced tanks in muscovites' inventory and continue to hold off relatively weak attacks (compared to November-December). In Vuhledar, the 72nd Mechanized Brigade is taking full revenge on enemy military equipment.\n\n> \u25b6\ufe0f On the Zaporizhzhia direction - no changes.\n\n> \u25b6\ufe0f On the Tavria direction - no changes.\n\n> \ud83d\uddc2 Analytical note. The situation remains difficult in the area of Kreminna, but the main focus is on the northern outskirts of Bakhmut. In fact, the situation in Bakhmut itself depends on the defenders of that facet of the Bakhmut salient. It's hard in the city, but everything is under control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the National Guard. There are no updates on the road to Kostyantynivka, so we believe that the task has been accomplished there at least for now. The katsap units in the area of the Donetsk airport have become more active due to replenishment, but losses in manpower and equipment will force them to look for replenishment again.",

The situation in Paraskoviyivka and Krasna Hora is not clear. In the city itself, the katsaps have a significant advantage in manpower, but our defenders not only hold the line, but also periodically inflict damage in the attack. No advances have been recorded south of the city, but the combat contact line is being refined there. </p>\n\n<p>\u25b6\ufe0f On the Avdiivka direction - the enemy has partial success north of Opytne and has completely occupied Vodiane. In Maryinka, paratroopers destroyed one of the most advanced tanks in muscovites&#39; inventory and continue to hold off relatively weak attacks (compared to November-December). In Vuhledar, the 72nd Mechanized Brigade is taking full revenge on enemy military equipment.</p>\n\n<p>\u25b6\ufe0f On the Zaporizhzhia direction - no changes.</p>\n\n<p>\u25b6\ufe0f On the Tavria direction - no changes.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\uddc2 Analytical note. The situation remains difficult in the area of Kreminna, but the main focus is on the northern outskirts of Bakhmut. In fact, the situation in Bakhmut itself depends on the defenders of that facet of the Bakhmut salient. It&#39;s hard in the city, but everything is under control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the National Guard. There are no updates on the road to Kostyantynivka, so we believe that the task has been accomplished there at least for now. The katsap units in the area of the Donetsk airport have become more active due to replenishment, but losses in manpower and equipment will force them to look for replenishment again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
