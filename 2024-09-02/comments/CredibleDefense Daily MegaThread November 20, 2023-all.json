            "body": "Each side has what can be called an outpost or security line. That's the zero line, the gray zone, the front lines as they met between fighting. Due to the proximity, often times with less than a kilometer between each side, they're limited on what they can develop because they are inside direct observation and range of pretty much all organic weaponry of the enemy tactical level units opposing them, so it's VERY dangerous trying to go elaborate on defenses. Digging at night is historically how that's countered, but this is war with at least the threat of thermals or other night observation devices.\n\nSo the real difference between each side's defenses are what's behind the immediate front lines, and the advantages for that go to Russia for being more elaborate.\n\nFirst, they have more mines, lots more. It wasn't just old AFV and arty shells they had in storage, they've been mass producing AT and AP mines for most of the last century. When the West was fawning at the memory of Princess Di's corpse, jumping at the chance to get rid of their mines, the Russians were laughing there asses off at the mountains of them they were still making. And it's very easy to plant mines in elaborate ways when not under direct observation and fires. \n\nThe West can't hold a candle to that and because of our adherence to a stupid ass decision we won't invest in building mines for Ukraine unless they're \"smart,\" which means expensive as hell and limited in number. \n\nNot just more mines, the Russians even have old Cold War era mine laying vehicles that can drop AT mines at certain distances and even dig them in for a bit of extra time. Much faster than laying by hand without needing to commit large numbers of trained personnel (don't keep idiots lay a minefield, they do [shit like this](https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1037xauto/public/2022/04/05/minesap.jpeg)).\n\nBut the Ukrainians don't have those minelayers, and neither does the West. We were never defensive focused enough for conventional ground operations during the Cold War to contemplate building them. \n\nFor entrenchments, field works dug into the Earth, the Russians have used an awful lot of spade work but also had the luxury of other Cold War era specialized entrenchment vehicles that could dig not trench trenches but anti-tank ditches too. Way faster and more economical than by hand, especially when not under direct observation and fires. \n\nThe Ukrainians don't have those and nether does the West, same reasons for not having mine laying vehicles.\n\nTo augment the anti-tank ditches the Russians have obstacles like dragons teeth. They have them and the Ukrainians don't because the Russian govt unlocked funding and then paid companies to make them, and then used heavy equipment to lay them in place. Helped because it was not under direct observation and fires.\n\nBut certain positions, namely bunkers and dugouts, call for more than just sandbags and logs, instead using reinforced concrete. The  Russians have some prefab types (designed, bought and paid for) as well as others they pour it on-site with actual engineers and contractor construction crews.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Each side has what can be called an outpost or security line. That&#39;s the zero line, the gray zone, the front lines as they met between fighting. Due to the proximity, often times with less than a kilometer between each side, they&#39;re limited on what they can develop because they are inside direct observation and range of pretty much all organic weaponry of the enemy tactical level units opposing them, so it&#39;s VERY dangerous trying to go elaborate on defenses. Digging at night is historically how that&#39;s countered, but this is war with at least the threat of thermals or other night observation devices.</p>\n\n<p>So the real difference between each side&#39;s defenses are what&#39;s behind the immediate front lines, and the advantages for that go to Russia for being more elaborate.</p>\n\n<p>First, they have more mines, lots more. It wasn&#39;t just old AFV and arty shells they had in storage, they&#39;ve been mass producing AT and AP mines for most of the last century. When the West was fawning at the memory of Princess Di&#39;s corpse, jumping at the chance to get rid of their mines, the Russians were laughing there asses off at the mountains of them they were still making. And it&#39;s very easy to plant mines in elaborate ways when not under direct observation and fires. </p>\n\n<p>The West can&#39;t hold a candle to that and because of our adherence to a stupid ass decision we won&#39;t invest in building mines for Ukraine unless they&#39;re &quot;smart,&quot; which means expensive as hell and limited in number. </p>\n\n<p>Not just more mines, the Russians even have old Cold War era mine laying vehicles that can drop AT mines at certain distances and even dig them in for a bit of extra time. Much faster than laying by hand without needing to commit large numbers of trained personnel (don&#39;t keep idiots lay a minefield, they do <a href=\"https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1037xauto/public/2022/04/05/minesap.jpeg\">shit like this</a>).</p>\n\n<p>But the Ukrainians don&#39;t have those minelayers, and neither does the West. We were never defensive focused enough for conventional ground operations during the Cold War to contemplate building them. </p>\n\n<p>For entrenchments, field works dug into the Earth, the Russians have used an awful lot of spade work but also had the luxury of other Cold War era specialized entrenchment vehicles that could dig not trench trenches but anti-tank ditches too. Way faster and more economical than by hand, especially when not under direct observation and fires. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians don&#39;t have those and nether does the West, same reasons for not having mine laying vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>To augment the anti-tank ditches the Russians have obstacles like dragons teeth. They have them and the Ukrainians don&#39;t because the Russian govt unlocked funding and then paid companies to make them, and then used heavy equipment to lay them in place. Helped because it was not under direct observation and fires.</p>\n\n<p>But certain positions, namely bunkers and dugouts, call for more than just sandbags and logs, instead using reinforced concrete. The  Russians have some prefab types (designed, bought and paid for) as well as others they pour it on-site with actual engineers and contractor construction crews. Helped because it was not under direct observation and fires (seeing a pattern here?).</p>\n\n<p>Last is lots of spade work, finishing touches that machines can&#39;t do, which was apparently done largely by conventional Russian troops. Say what you will about their discipline but they obey orders when told to dig in, which is historically actually a good sign of legitimate military discipline (because it sucks and nobody wants to do it), and especially toughness (because digging SUCKS).</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians also dig in by hand, pretty much everything they dig in is by hand, which is actually also impressive.

There are an additional 1,922 M-113s supporting non-ABCT affiliated units (referred to as Echelons Above Brigade [EAB] units) that are not included in the Army\u2019s modernization plan.\n\nI used [this site](https://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php) to look at the numbers of M113s used for military aid since 2007 when the Army stopped ordering them.\n\n* Afghanistan - 370\n* Bahrain - 221\n* Brazil - 76\n* Greece - 370\n* Iraq - 904\n* Israel - 300\n* Jordan - 500\n* Lebanon - 200\n* Morocco - 917\n* Pakistan - 1,050\n* Philippines - 114\n\n**Total Given Away: 5,022**\n\n**Total in use**: 4,819\n\nFurther evidence of not having great stores is that in 2011 to provide Iraq's M113s, they were pulling [20 year old ones out of the Sierra Depot](https://defense-update.com/20130702_m113s_to_iraq.html), and in 2022 the US had to get their first donations from [the National Guard](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/04/29/national-guards-aging-battle-taxis-find-new-use-in-ukraine-fight/). \n\nWith that being said, there are hundreds of M113s around the world that are for sale the US could purchase and send to Ukraine. When I looked all this up in September, there were 300 alone in Israel. Those might not be available for obvious reasons, but there are still quite a few out there. They likely would need heavy work, though. Case in point, the Ukrainian power companies [managed to purchase 50 for the Border Guards](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/ukrainian-power-companies-buy-50-m113-apcs-for-border-guards/)\n\n**ABRAMS**\n\nThere are some points needed to frame this conversation. First, the US doesn't make Abrams hulls anymore, but refurbishes stored ones. Second, export Abrams don't have DU armor like domestic Abrams do; that needs to be removed and replaced with a tungsten variant. Besides secrecy reasons, there also is legal reasons for this, though that can be waived. \n\nNow, with those points in mind:\n\nI've seen that they're are roughly 2,000-3,000 in storage. Current foreign Abrams orders are:\n\n**Taiwan** - 108 - approved in 2019\n\nThe first batch of 38 Abrams tanks is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan by 2024, followed by 42 in 2025, and 28 in 2026.\n\n**Poland** - 336ish (116 M1A1s/250 M1A2s)\n\nThe M1A1s started delivery this year, with all 116 due to be in Poland by the end of 2024.\n\nThe 250 M1A2s will be delivered in the 2025-2026 time frame. \n\n**Australia** - 75\n\nDeliveries of M1A2 SEPV3 is scheduled to begin in 2024, with initial operational readiness achieved in 2025. \n\nThere's an opportunity here for a quick refurbishing of their old M1A1s if they are willing to trade them back. \n\n**Romania** - 54 (maybe)\n\nRomania's legislature approved the purchase of 54 Abrams at $1bn. The price the US quoted was $2bn. The legislature sent the administration a letter reminding them that they only approved $1bn. So we'll see what happens there. \n\n**Total Outstanding Foreign Orders**: 500-600 depending on the number of deliveries this year and Romania.\n\nThe US Army also needs Abrams. They usually request 80-100 a year, and usually get 25-50 instead. In FY24 they planned for 30, FY25 they planned for 53, FY26 is 42, and FY27 is 40. However, that was from earlier this year, so maybe those numbers will go up. \n\nSo conservatively, 500/3,000 stored Abrams are already spoken for. \n\nLet's talk about production. Last year, [the Army acquisition chief stated he would welcome tank ramp-up if Congress funds it](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2022/05/18/army-acquisition-chief-would-welcome-tank-ramp-up-if-congress-funds-it/). He noted that about 15 Abrams are built per month. Earlier this year, it was said that [while the Lima plant is currently building 15-20 armored vehicles per month \u2014 including tanks \u2014 it can easily boost that to 33 a month and could add another shift of workers and build even more if needed.](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-military-technology-business-55e3f4ef1696ca381e069883d5836399) So current Abrams production is roughly 180 tanks per year, but could be boosted to 300+ range before adding another shift.\n\nIf all of the expanded production went to Ukraine, that's roughly 200-300 Abrams per year. Not overwhelming but not anything to sneeze at either. However, in relation to \u201churting security commitments\u201d you're now talking about 1/3 to 1/2 of the stored Abrams being used. There are also other allies that use and may expand their Abrams fleets as well (Morocco mainly).\n\nOf course, there is another option: buy them from Egypt. They have 1,360 M1A1 export versions, and haven't been shy about wanting to get away from US tanks (though I don't think those T-90s will be coming anytime soon). The politics are atrocious but money talks. Egypt also isn't exactly in dire straits and needing tanks, either. They could sell a couple hundred and use it to buy Chinese/Indian tanks, probably for cheaper. \n\n**BRADLEYS**\n\nNo idea.\n\nEdit: For readability, flow, and adding a TLDR.",

        "body": "Bloomberg has a long-form article on China and the combat readiness of the PLA. Going to share excerpts, but would encourage a full reading for those interested. \n\n>[Can China Fight?](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2023-war-china-taiwan/?srnd=bigtake#xj4y7vzkg)\n>>The Russia-Ukraine War Offers Warnings.\n\n>It\u2019s 2027. A Chinese naval blockade is forming off the coast of Taiwan, cyber attacks are hobbling the island\u2019s financial system, paratroopers are massing at coastal airfields and the US aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy is pulling out of port in Japan with a fleet of F-35 jets, heading south at full power.\n\n>The battle for Taiwan is about to begin.\n\n>This is just a scenario for now, one of many that leaders in Beijing, Washington and Taipei are bracing for \u2014 and which their militaries train for every day, as tensions rise over the island\u2019s future. But for all the billions of dollars spent building advanced weaponry and modernizing its forces, at the most senior levels of China\u2019s military and government right up to President Xi Jinping there are doubts that the People\u2019s Liberation Army is ready for battle \u2014 or will be for years to come. \n\n>Beijing\u2019s worries about its own capabilities have only grown as Russia remains mired in a war in Ukraine that President Vladimir Putin and his military \u2014 and many Western analysts and governments \u2014 assumed would be a quick and easy invasion.\n\n>Under Xi, China has worked hard to make victory in any conflict inevitable. With more than 2.1 million active-duty troops, it has the world\u2019s largest military, as well as the largest rocket force. It has more than 400 ships and 3,100 aircraft, according to Pentagon assessments, giving it the world\u2019s biggest navy and the third-largest aviation force. Its nuclear stockpile surpassed 400 warheads in 2021 and is on track to reach 1,500 by 2035 \u2014 around what the US and Russia have deployed at any given time. Taiwan\u2019s unification with China is \u201cunstoppable,\u201d Xi\u2019s government said after the Chinese leader met President Joe Biden in California Nov. 15.\n\n>But interviews with dozens of current and former US and Chinese officials, as well as publications by the People\u2019s Liberation Army and criticisms leveled by Xi, paint a common picture: While China has made extraordinarily rapid progress in military hardware, building everything from aircraft carriers to hypersonic missiles, its ability to translate that into effective combat operations remains a major weakness \u2014 especially if any warfighting has to be sustained.\n\n>A PLA victory ultimately could hinge on its ability to operate effectively on the battlefield over time. And a number of factors are working against China: It hasn\u2019t fought a major conflict in decades, the military has a history of corruption and different branches of the armed forces have struggled to coordinate. \n\n>Perhaps the most damning of these slogans is the \u201cfive cannots.\u201d That 2015 phrase asserts that some PLA officers are unable to effectively judge situations, are incapable of understanding higher authorities\u2019 intentions, struggle to make operational decisions, have difficulty deploying troops and experience problems when dealing with unexpected situations \u2014 everything they\u2019d need to manage in a conflict.\n\n>The critiques continue to this day: In the span of two weeks in July, Xi made three separate and public calls to strengthen military management. That coincided with turmoil in China\u2019s rocket forces \u2014 the division that oversees the country\u2019s ballistic missile stockpiles and which would be responsible for targeting US surface vessels in a conflict over Taiwan.\n\n>Weeks later came the mysterious disappearance of Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who Xi handpicked for the role early this year, following the sidelining of then-Foreign Minister Qin Gang. Li\u2019s dismissal was finally announced in late October, making him China\u2019s shortest-serving defense minister. While Beijing has said little about the turnover, China analysts agree the moves suggest that even after a decade of anti-graft and modernization initiatives, the PLA still struggles to meet Xi\u2019s expectations.\n\n>>Ukraine Lessons\n\n>\u201cRussia\u2019s military has been incapable of effectively executing combined warfare,\u201d where multiple ground units work together, the official PLA Daily said in an editorial this year. It added that Moscow has also struggled with \u201cintegrated air-ground operations\u201d because the Russian air force\u2019s \u201ccoordination with the army is limited.\u201d\n\n>Getting the PLA to be more effective at combined warfare and improving the ability of different branches of the military to coordinate their efforts have been among Xi\u2019s biggest priorities for his forces. And it would be a critical feature of any successful attack on Taiwan. \n\n>\u201cPresident Xi is probably looking at what\u2019s happening in Ukraine and saying to himself: \u2018Complicated military operations are harder than they look,\u2019\u201d US Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do all of the logistic stuff that can be, you know, pretty unsexy, but I think we\u2019ve seen in Ukraine how very, very important that is.\u201d\n\n>In the years since, the PLA Army has increasingly conducted joint training with PLA Navy ships and civilian vessels in a bid to develop amphibious landing capabilities. Yet PLA publications continue to underscore the difficulties China faces, with a 2020 essay warning of a \u201cmountain stronghold mentality\u201d that prevents integration.\n\n>\u201cJoint operations are currently a serious difficulty we face in our military struggle,\u201d according to the analysis. \n\n>Another challenge Russia has faced in Ukraine has been its reliance on reservists it drafted into service, many of whom were untrained and poorly armed when they were thrown into combat. \n\n>Roughly one-third of China\u2019s two million-person military is composed of two-year conscripts, according to a study in War on the Rocks co-authored by former US military intelligence officer Dennis Blasko. That means much of the PLA\u2019s forces, including the rocket force and the Army\u2019s amphibious troops, are constantly introducing and training new recruits. By the time a unit gets up to full strength, it\u2019s time for a large portion of its more experienced personnel to leave. \n\n>Russia\u2019s war has also been stymied by corruption, an issue that has historically plagued the PLA. In July, China announced a graft probe into the PLA\u2019s equipment procurement department going back to 2017, showing the difficulty in uprooting malfeasance from the armed forces.\n\n>>\u2018Peace Disease\u2019\n\n>Xi and his generals dub this lack of experience China\u2019s \u201cpeace disease.\u201d The official PLA Daily warned of the affliction as recently as last year, citing Xi\u2019s repeated pronouncements: \u201cIn a long-term peaceful environment, officers and soldiers are prone to \u2018peace disease,\u2019\u201d it wrote. \n\n>In a naval conflict, for instance, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the ships, but are you good at complex battle management?\u201d said Lonnie Henley, who spent four decades as a US intelligence analyst focused on China and Asia. \u201cYou don\u2019t want everyone shooting at the same missile or another missile will take out your carrier.\u201d The air force, which seldom trains its pilots to prepare for the real-world conditions of war, faces similar challenges, he added. \n\n>>Command-and-control\n\n>Unlike in most countries, the PLA isn\u2019t technically China\u2019s military: it\u2019s the armed wing of the Communist Party. That means that, even for a military, the PLA is highly top-down, a problem that risks the ability of its commanders to make quick decisions on the ground as battlefield conditions change. \n\n>The PLA has adjusted its doctrine to let the military take more initiative during operations, but the process remains slow and imperfect. Ironically, recent technologies such as video conferencing, secure computer networks and satellite communications have enabled high-tech forms of micromanagement.\n\n>Andrew Scobell, a PLA expert at the US Institute of Peace and co-author of China\u2019s Search for Security, said China remains more focused on the \u201ccontrol\u201d rather than the \u201ccommand\u201d part of \u201ccommand and control,\u201d adding that the consequences could prove debilitating. \n\n>\u201cThis obsession with control means they\u2019re not agile and flexible,\u201d Scobell said. \u201cIf things change on the battlefield, the order you were given days ago may be disastrous to execute.\u201d\n\n>>Quick Victory\n\n>Many of these shortcomings won\u2019t matter if China manages to overwhelm Taiwan\u2019s forces quickly and the US and its allies are slow to act. That\u2019s the message from numerous war games run by think tanks seeking to understand how a battle over Taiwan could evolve. \n\n>Those scenarios show that the self-governed island would be outnumbered on almost every front. Even if the US intervenes, its formidable forces would be captive to supply lines potentially stretching thousands of miles and, as the US move to bolster operations in the Mideast shows, possibly hamstrung by conflicts in other parts of the world. \n\n>US spy chiefs and the Pentagon assess that Xi wants his military capable of overwhelming the island by 2027, cautioning that they don\u2019t have evidence he currently plans to do so. China\u2019s own doubts may make such a conflict less likely, if only because a failure to capture Taiwan, or winning at too high a cost, could mean the Communist Party\u2019s downfall. If China does directly invade Taiwan, avoiding the Ukraine scenario will be a priority. The PLA would come to that fight with a lot of advantages, but not all the ones that matter. \n\n>\u201cThe truth is, no one knows how ready they are,\u201d Culver, the former CIA analyst, said. \u201cAny war would be a long war, probably the most costly since World War II, even if we win.\u201d",

In July, China announced a graft probe into the PLA\u2019s equipment procurement department going back to 2017, showing the difficulty in uprooting malfeasance from the armed forces.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018Peace Disease\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Xi and his generals dub this lack of experience China\u2019s \u201cpeace disease.\u201d The official PLA Daily warned of the affliction as recently as last year, citing Xi\u2019s repeated pronouncements: \u201cIn a long-term peaceful environment, officers and soldiers are prone to \u2018peace disease,\u2019\u201d it wrote. </p>\n\n<p>In a naval conflict, for instance, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the ships, but are you good at complex battle management?\u201d said Lonnie Henley, who spent four decades as a US intelligence analyst focused on China and Asia. \u201cYou don\u2019t want everyone shooting at the same missile or another missile will take out your carrier.\u201d The air force, which seldom trains its pilots to prepare for the real-world conditions of war, faces similar challenges, he added. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Command-and-control</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unlike in most countries, the PLA isn\u2019t technically China\u2019s military: it\u2019s the armed wing of the Communist Party. That means that, even for a military, the PLA is highly top-down, a problem that risks the ability of its commanders to make quick decisions on the ground as battlefield conditions change. </p>\n\n<p>The PLA has adjusted its doctrine to let the military take more initiative during operations, but the process remains slow and imperfect. Ironically, recent technologies such as video conferencing, secure computer networks and satellite communications have enabled high-tech forms of micromanagement.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew Scobell, a PLA expert at the US Institute of Peace and co-author of China\u2019s Search for Security, said China remains more focused on the \u201ccontrol\u201d rather than the \u201ccommand\u201d part of \u201ccommand and control,\u201d adding that the consequences could prove debilitating. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis obsession with control means they\u2019re not agile and flexible,\u201d Scobell said. \u201cIf things change on the battlefield, the order you were given days ago may be disastrous to execute.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Quick Victory</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many of these shortcomings won\u2019t matter if China manages to overwhelm Taiwan\u2019s forces quickly and the US and its allies are slow to act. That\u2019s the message from numerous war games run by think tanks seeking to understand how a battle over Taiwan could evolve. </p>\n\n<p>Those scenarios show that the self-governed island would be outnumbered on almost every front. Even if the US intervenes, its formidable forces would be captive to supply lines potentially stretching thousands of miles and, as the US move to bolster operations in the Mideast shows, possibly hamstrung by conflicts in other parts of the world. </p>\n\n<p>US spy chiefs and the Pentagon assess that Xi wants his military capable of overwhelming the island by 2027, cautioning that they don\u2019t have evidence he currently plans to do so. China\u2019s own doubts may make such a conflict less likely, if only because a failure to capture Taiwan, or winning at too high a cost, could mean the Communist Party\u2019s downfall. If China does directly invade Taiwan, avoiding the Ukraine scenario will be a priority. The PLA would come to that fight with a lot of advantages, but not all the ones that matter. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe truth is, no one knows how ready they are,\u201d Culver, the former CIA analyst, said. \u201cAny war would be a long war, probably the most costly since World War II, even if we win.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The FCS has since been upgraded, while GLSDB has been sitting around accruing code rust. When reworking the munitions for Ukraine, the engineering team likely faced a trade off between modifying the launchers versus modifying the weapons to ensure compatibility, and there are many reasons that modifying the weapon alone may not have been sufficient to make the system work. It may not have been worth upgrading the entire HIMARS fleet without at least proving out the concept with a real combat deployment. So it\u2019d be worth custom modifying one HIMARS to get to an MVP, get it deployed, then revisit upgrading the entire fleet if the weapon proves effective in combat, rather than investing in getting all of the existing launchers upgraded to support one as of yet unproven munition type",

When reworking the munitions for Ukraine, the engineering team likely faced a trade off between modifying the launchers versus modifying the weapons to ensure compatibility, and there are many reasons that modifying the weapon alone may not have been sufficient to make the system work. It may not have been worth upgrading the entire HIMARS fleet without at least proving out the concept with a real combat deployment. So it\u2019d be worth custom modifying one HIMARS to get to an MVP, get it deployed, then revisit upgrading the entire fleet if the weapon proves effective in combat, rather than investing in getting all of the existing launchers upgraded to support one as of yet unproven munition type</p>\n</div>",

CIT conducted an analysis of open source data to determine what is really happening with volunteer fighter recruitment\n\n\nLast week, Dmitry Medvedev [Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council] once again reported on the progress of the recruitment campaign to find contract soldiers for the war against Ukraine. He claimed that 410,000 individuals had joined the ranks of the Russian Armed Forces between Jan. 1 and Nov. 9. If Medvedev is to be believed, the authorities would have thus met their objectives for 2023. Their plan, according to various estimates, was to recruit between 400,000 and 415,000 people.\n\n\nUnder closer examination, however, the situation \u201con the ground\u201d does not look so good for Russia. In the middle of August, for instance, a video recorded during a meeting with employees of a Tolyatti company shows an official discussing both recruitment targets and the true state of affairs. Apparently, the city was handed down a target of 2,000 recruits, but managed to sign up just over 250, or only 12.5% of the required number, four or five months after the start of the campaign.\n\n\nOn Nov. 11, the Free Yakutia foundation published the recording of a closed-door meeting of officials held in September, during which the military commissar of Yakutia [Russia\u2019s constituent republic] presented data on the fulfillment of the recruitment plan by various districts in the republic. We have compiled this data into a table, adding the population figures of each district to enhance clarity. As shown in our table, the republic aimed to recruit at least 3,322 people (slightly more in reality, as the military commissar did not provide data for all districts). This figure corresponds to approximately 470,000 people when extrapolated nationwide. The plan for Yakutia might have been above average, potentially aiming to compensate for shortfalls in regions like Moscow, where, as stated by Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, the plan was fulfilled by recruiting 22,000 people\u2014a number evidently disproportionate to the city's demographic capabilities. However, by September, Yakutia had recruited less than a third of the required 3,322 people, specifically 1,017 individuals, or only 30.6% of the plan.\n\n\nIn light of these two sources, it becomes evident that the actual recruitment rate significantly lags behind the data regularly voiced by Medvedev, and the target remains far from being met. The recent campaign to increase sign-on bonuses for potential contract soldiers serves as additional confirmation. In the past two weeks alone, at least five regions have introduced additional or increased existing bonuses paid upon signing a contract. While this practice has been ongoing throughout the recruitment campaign, the concurrent year-end initiatives in several federal subjects indicate that local authorities are facing challenges in meeting their recruitment quotas. We believe that the aim of such measures is not necessarily to achieve a 100% goal\u2014officials must realize this is impossible\u2014but rather to surpass their counterparts in other regions and avoid ending up at the bottom of the KPI list, where the recruitment of contract soldiers significantly influences the rankings.\n\n\nIn summary, a range of various OSINT data confirms our belief that the number of recruited contract soldiers declared by Medvedev is far from reality. Simultaneously, to obtain a more complete picture, it is important to understand whether the data announced by regional authorities includes mobilized soldiers, volunteer fighters and conscripts signing contracts with the Ministry of Defense.

The Russians had insufficient infantry in their BTGs, while the units lacked cohesion or sufficient staff capacity to properly employ their combined arms elements. Casualties and the failure of the approach have led the AFRF to revert to relying on four infantry unit types: disposable; line; assault; and specialised. These are used in combination in both attack and defence, in a manner shaped by current operational challenges that is not formally codified in doctrine. Line, assault and specialised infantry are generated through the normal Russian recruitment and training system. Line infantry are generally based on mechanised units. They differ from assault infantry in that they have not received specific assault training and are therefore mainly used for supporting tasks, improving and occupying defensive positions. Assault infantry have received additional training, closer to what would be expected of NATO light infantry forces, and are considered to be a skilled and valuable asset. As such, they are spared some of the mundanity and back-breaking labour of digging in for defensive operations in order to prevent fatigue and attrition,and to allow them to conduct rehearsals for offensive operations. Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) and naval infantry units are generally, though not universally, assault units in practice, with a cultural expectation that they will have an esprit de corps, level of competence and appropriately aggressive mindset. Wagner Group and other Russian private military companies (PMCs) have also been involved in the formation of assault units. Specialised infantry might be generated from the infantry, VDV, the professional elements of Wagner Group, Spetsnaz or other corps, but have received additional role-specific training and equipment which allow for a particular kind of employment. Russia's disposable infantry should be considered fundamentally different and are drawn from three principal sources: conscripts from the Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics (heavily attrited from early rounds of fighting); prisoners drafted by the Wagner Group; and under- trained mobilised Russian civilians. These troops were originally formed into companies of approximately 60 people, but have since been broken down into platoons of approximately 15. They are issued with small arms. Ukrainian troops report that they often appear to be under the influence of amphetamines or other narcotic substances, with material recovered from the battlefield indicating that these are commonly taken in liquid form. In the attack, disposable infantry are the first to be employed. Disposable platoons are assigned to those avenues of approach to Ukrainian positions that are deemed to offer some cover and thus could prove viable. Although these have been described colloquially as 'human wave attacks', they no longer involve a dense concentration of infantry conducting an assault in a single mass. Rather, a disposable fire team of two to five personnel is sent from a forming-up position in the Russian front line and advances to contact. There may be up to five fire teams pushed across an axis at any one time, but normally only one or two teams will be able to work forwards. The team will skirmish with Ukrainian defensive positions on contact, often until killed. Ukrainian troops noted that many continued to advance, even after being wounded. On more than one occasion Ukrainian soldiers report that disposable infantry have been shot from Russian positions when attempting to retreat. As teams are destroyed by defensive fire, Russian forces will commit successive teams forward by the same line of approach. Ukrainian forces must continuously defend their positions against consecutive waves, expending ammunition, exposing the locations of their defensive positions, and exhausting their personnel. If these attacks were executed by capable assault troops motivated by factors other than coercion and narcotics, they would be roughly equivalent to historical assault tactics such as the short attacks' of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean War. 14 The term 'human wave attacks' is certainly misleading for probes by successive small assault teams against enemy defences. However, the way that they are conducted is not conducive to successful assaults nor to the maintenance of momentum. Rather, the continuous conduct of this activity, across all axes, is a form of reconnaissance that allows the Russian forces to do two things. First, they find points of weakness in the Ukrainian defences where these troops make surprising amounts of progress or face very limited fire. These are then prioritised for deliberate assault. Alternatively, where the defence is strong, the revelation of Ukrainian firing positions allows specialised troops to begin targeting them. Russian specialised troops are deployed as irregular groupings of snipers, artillery spotters and support weapon operators. While Ukrainian forces are suppressing disposable infantry, additional disposable troops are often pushed forwards as working groups to dig fox holes and prepare firing positions closer to Ukrainian defences. These personnel are withdrawn and replaced by specialists who can establish observation and sniping posts or set up heavy weapons. They can then be used to direct accurate fire against Ukrainian firing posts from a range of up to 2 km and inflict attrition. Conversely, if a weaker point is identified and a deliberate assault is planned, the approach is to move additional disposable troops to dig forward positions for specialised infantry. Rather than seeking to simply attrit the defence, this becomes a base of fire. Furthermore, artillery fire shifts from harassment to barrage, enabling Russian assault infantry to attack \u2013 often favouring a flank. Assault infantry tend to advance in company strength with the support of armour and, among better Russian units, utilising a mixture of artillery systems. 152-mm howitzers fire until the assault is 400 m from the target position, after which fire is taken over by 122-mm howitzer or 120-mm mortar fire until the assault closes to its final assault positions. The final advance is covered by infantry mortars and then grenades are used before entering the target position. These troops tend to endeavour to turn the flank of a defensive position. On taking a position, they are often withdrawn and replaced by line infantry and additional disposable troops who set about fortifying the position so that it can be held as a base for further probing actions.",

This approach to urban warfare also relies on very good equipment and a mismatch between opponent. The overall strategy would not have worked for the Russians in Mariupol.  \n\n1. Construction of fortified strongpoints throughout the city *that were not the initial built environment*. Israel has formed massive dirt embankments that provide relative \"safe zones\" within the operating environment. This makes counter attacks (even without the complete fire superiority the IDF enjoys) nearly impossible. \n\n2. Trusting the Tank. There has been several videos of attacks on IDF tanks, but I have not seen any imagery of destroyed tanks after the events of 10/7. Trophy appears to be doing its job, and that means reduced need for squishy meatbags to walk alongside and near the tanks where they can easily be injured. \n3. Hamas cannot use strongpoints to contest territory. Attacking into a tunnel is extremely difficult... but so is attacking out of a tunnel once its location is known (it may even be more difficult). This means once a tunnel has been found, it is now useless. Any above ground position of sufficient resistance can be completely leveled, unlike Azovstal (which resisted dozens of >1000kg bomb hits and thousands of artillery shells).  \n\nNow, point 3 means that as the area Hamas controls shrinks, the fighting will pick up significantly in intensity.  The casualty list to growth will increase as the amount of territory occupied by the IDf increases, but I expect Hamas will be forced into taking even worse engagements. They could of course drop their weapons and flee, but that still accomplishes the objective of disarming Hamas after the territory is seized.",

[Source](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/manpower-and-counterinsurgency)\n\nI\u2019ve seen estimates of Hamas forces between 15,000-30,000 fighters, not counting other groups like PIJ. Achieving a 5:1 force ratio would require an occupying force of 75,000 (low) - 150,000 (high). 6:1 would be 90,000 - 180,000. 10:1 would be 150,000 - 300,000.

Managing their illegal occupation and protecting their settler-colonists in the West Bank ties up a significant number of troops, and fighting may yet flare up there as well. They also have to worry about the northern border with Lebanon and the threat of war with Hezbollah, who are much more capable and sophisticated than Hamas. So even if we took the lowest estimate of Gazan fighters and the lowest force ratio that has a chance of suppressing them (6:1, 90,000) that represents over half of the standing Israeli military before the war. They can\u2019t dedicate more than half their standing military to an occupation force when they have 3 areas to worry about. Are they prepared to expend huge amounts of money to expand their military dramatically in order to occupy Gaza for what might be years or even decades? Are they even going to be able to, given the lack of support of the international community for that outcome?",

By ceasefire in this context I mean not just a tactical pause of hostilities of weeks or maybe a few months, but rather something that could end warfare for at least a year or several years.\n\nRussia has been reluctant to name concrete war goals, but there seem to be two things that would seem essential for Russia. The first is the control over the regions that Russia claims as annexed since fall 2023. Russia claims that these regions are part of Russia proper. Any kind of deal under which Ukraine keeps control would therefore from the Russian pov mean that Russia accepts that parts of the country remain under foreign occupation for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nThis is less of a problem for Donezk, Luhansk and Crimea, since these regions are fully or at least mostly under Russian control. However, things are different for Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. In both cases, the regional and eponymous capitals are under the control of Ukraine. It is hard to claim that Russia controls Kherson oblast if Kherson is under control of Ukraine.\n\nConsidering the glacial pace of Russian offensives, there is very little possibility for Russia to retake Kherson, especially since Russia felt it necessary to withdraw from that position about a year ago. It is not apparent how Russia should be able to cross the Dniepr in force, take a major population centre and supply units on the West Bank when it could not do so a year ago.\n\nWhich means that - assuming Russia would make control of the \"annexed\" regions a condition for a ceasefire, Ukraine would have to concede considerably more ground than it has lost over the last year. Even more important, Ukraine would have to give Russia footholds on the West Bank of the Dniepr, thereby endangering the best defensive line Ukraine has. It is hard to see how Ukraine would be so desperate for a ceasefire that this could be acceptable.\n\nThe second major point that Russia claimed as a justification for war was the political alignment of Ukraine. Regardless of whether this is described as \"denazification\", \"the collection of Russian soil\", safeguarding Russia from Nato, the goal is always the same - to keep Ukraine in the Russian sphere and to prevent Ukraine from fully aligning with the West and namely, EU and and NATO.\n\nThere is very little reason to believe that Ukraine as of now would be willing to accept such conditions, especially since there would be no guarantee that Russia would feel obliged to keep the peace vis a vis a neutral Ukraine. If anything, the war and its consequences will have strengthened the resolve of the Ukrainian people to seek new alliances and to safeguard against further Russian incursions.\n\nWithout having discussed what might be acceptable for Ukraine as a condition for a semi-permanent ceasefire, it is evident that the conditions Russia would likely ask for are inacceptable fot Kyiv. Which means that all talks about a ceasefire are moot. Both sides are not exhausted or desperate enough to seriously consider the concessions that would necessary to make such a deal work.

When Ukraine aid is subject to the whims of a dozen people in Congress, how is the West supposed to help Ukraine come up with a viable political strategy, or assist them in carrying out a strategy that they themselves may or may not have come up with? House Republican leadership will be even more reluctant to engage in Ukraine aid debates as the election gets closer, especially since the most vocal opponents of Ukraine aid are the same people who ousted the last Speaker. I don't buy Johnson's half-hearted commitment to Ukraine aid, but even if he were to push *something* through the House, I highly doubt it'll be at the levels that Biden or even Senate Republicans are asking for. Unless, by some miracle, the House passes a generous aid package, we'll probably see more Ukraine drama at the height of primary/general election season, which is just... awful timing.\n\nThe other thing is that Ukraine's counteroffensive petered out without a ton of success, and even though most of us here knew that was always going to be a tough fight, the UA government hyping it up even after it stalled isn't a great look. Messing around on the outskirts of Bakhmut and whatever the hell is happening on the left bank both seem to be more like PR moves than anything else.
