As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly expressed cautious optimism recently that Beijing could help defuse the conflict. \n\n>The approach is based on the belief that neither side has the ability to continue fighting indefinitely, and that Beijing\u2019s willingness to play a role in international peace talks should be tested, the officials said. Still, they remain uncertain about Russia\u2019s willingness to negotiate a cease-fire under Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n>The interest in negotiations brings Washington in closer alignment with some European countries, which are eager to see the conflict end, or at the very least moderate in intensity, and have been the most intent on discussing some resolution this year. The U.S., the U.K. and other countries have been publicly saying that Ukraine should be supported as long as it takes to defeat Russia. \n\n>\u201cWe have been clear that we will continue to support Ukraine as they defend their country from Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion, and that support will continue,\u201d said Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the National Security Council. \u201cUnfortunately, we see no signs that Russia is preparing to stop its attacks on the Ukrainian people. That\u2019s why we are committed to continuing to help Ukraine protect its people against Russian aggression.\u201d\n\n>French President Emmanuel Macron has been the most explicit in pushing Ukraine to seek negotiations with the Kremlin after the spring offensive. Officials at the White House and State Department have long maintained that all wars end at the negotiating table, but said that it will require a genuine interest on the part of Russia to approach any talks in good faith. The military aid dispatched to Ukraine is designed to put Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position.\n\n>Key U.S. officials on the National Security Council are in favor of negotiations, according to European officials, while the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency have been more skeptical, eager to see how the offensive goes before pitching for a diplomatic off-ramp.\n\n>An NSC spokesperson disputed European accounts that there is division within the administration. The State Department and the CIA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n>Senior officials in Paris and Berlin who are familiar with their leaders\u2019 discussions with President Biden say they expect the White House to attempt to facilitate talks following the Ukrainian offensive\u2019s anticipated gains.\n\n>The aim is for Ukraine to regain important territory in the south, a development that could be interpreted as a success even if Russia retains chunks of territory its forces have occupied.\n\n>Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Berlin this month on what is set to be his first trip to Germany since Russia invaded in February 2022. While Mr. Scholz won\u2019t pressure Mr. Zelensky into talks, Mr. Biden is expected to signal to the Ukrainian leader that cease-fire talks might be opportune in the coming months, European officials said.\n\n>The push to negotiate comes in the midst of concern on both sides of the Atlantic that the scale of support provided by allies to Ukraine for the coming push will be hard to match in the future if the war grinds into a stalemate. The supply of ammunition is a key problem because Western industrial capacity has proven unable to meet its own demands while supporting Ukraine, several officials and industry leaders said.",

IF western aid to Ukraine (which is the only thing really keeping it going at this point, outside of an insurgency) stops then i believe the Ukrainian gov will have no choice but to negotiate whatever terms the Russians give or fight till the bitter end.\n\nI know many here would like to see this war end with a clear Ukrainian victory, but being realistic, i'm not sure its possible. I think a negotiated peace that favors Russia is the most likely.",

The Russian polititical culture evolved out of the wider Soviet political culture. The only treaties it views as binding is the ones that are too risky to break, both because that was the historical Soviet perspective and because the current system if international laws is just not one that Russian politicians are going to accept -- they're the proteges of the political generation wound up on the losing side of the Cold War.\n\n> What could be done to empower the Russian people to force peace on their government and reap the benefits of improved infrastructure thereafter?\n\nThis is where I'm pessimistic tbh.\n\nFirst off, any regional independence movement is working against a hundred years of deliberate anti-regional economic policy. Most Russian federal subjects are wholly dependent on a federal government for some aspects of their activity -- they may be e.g. sitting on large amounts of resources, which would nominally make them capable of standing on their own, but have zero economic activity outside that, if they sever ties with the central government they'd have food riots in weeks. They might achieve better decentralization but IMHO for most of the independence is just not going to happen. Most of the regional governments just won't go for it.\n\nSecond, I doubt Russian people can force peace on their government through democratic means. Post-Soviet Russia had maybe a couple of years of immediate post-Soviet democracy, with all its flaws -- it's a country entirely devoid of democratic culture. Except for some younger folks from large, Western Russian cities, the idea of citizens being involved in state affairs is essentially foreign -- attitude towards state policy doesn't go from \"disapproval\" to \"approval\", it goes from \"apathetic\" to \"approval\".
