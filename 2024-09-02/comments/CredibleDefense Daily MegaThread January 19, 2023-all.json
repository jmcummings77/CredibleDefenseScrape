I suppose we should be grateful that he wasn't a KGB general. Another interesting snippet is that he wasn't from the First Directorate where the best went, but from counter intelligence,\n\n>Like the New Look Reforms created a \"professional\" army of contract troops (voluntary enlisted), so the assumption was they'd act professional. Forgetting that both the Iraqi Army and Afghan National Army were also all volunteers. Or that plenty of armies in history, including our own, relied on conscription but were still high performing.\n\nANA had it's own issues, the recruits were picked for kickbacks or they paid half their salary to the warlord. US never trained or picked good soldiers. The educated ones did perform well. Iraqi army is a function of the ME education system. The soldiers it produces is another story.\n\n>Or corruption, incompetence, etc. That's extremely hard to plan around, intelligence analysis always has issues with the human element of data because it's not quantifiable, so subjective, so easy to be wrong, much safer to err on the side of overestimating than under. Especially when there isn't tangible evidence of how widespread it is. It wasn't really apparent in the Donbas War or Syria, there was no way to know how bad it actually was until they went to war on a very large scale.\n\nMorale is hard to quantify. Also, Western inteligence didn't know that Russian troops would find out that they are in Ukraine when they read the road signs. In contrast, US took months to prepare for Iraq.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Or doctrine. They showed off some skills in the Donbas War THAT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF WESTERN DEFENSE EXPERTS. It was believed those skills (involving combined arms warfare, mostly fires and targeting) were both universal and capable of being done on the fly. But nope, definitely not universal, and only as part of highly planned, centralized, set piece battles that didn't characterize the first month and a half of the war.\n\nThe entire greyzone/hybrid concept that was supposed to be the new doctrine.\n\n>Then there were other factors that NOBODY could have foreseen because they make no sense.  \n>  \n>That Russian wouldn't include its conscripts in the order of battle, despite making up about 1/3 of their manpower. That Russia would allow contract troops to resign at will. That the Russians would stage on the border of Ukraine for months and not actually take the time to prep and train. That the Russians would purposely withhold knowledge of the invasion of their own forces until 1-2 days prior, leaving no time to train, plan, prep, rehearse. That the entire invasion would be predicated on stated assumptions of \"Don't worry, they won't give back, they'll welcome you as liberators.\"\n\nI believe that the best of KGB left a long time ago. In fairness US believed that Iraqould welcome then after half a million Iraqi kids died becaue they couldn't import medicines due to sanctions. Remember the famous Madeleine Albright  interview?",

Or that plenty of armies in history, including our own, relied on conscription but were still high performing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>ANA had it&#39;s own issues, the recruits were picked for kickbacks or they paid half their salary to the warlord. US never trained or picked good soldiers. The educated ones did perform well. Iraqi army is a function of the ME education system. The soldiers it produces is another story.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or corruption, incompetence, etc. That&#39;s extremely hard to plan around, intelligence analysis always has issues with the human element of data because it&#39;s not quantifiable, so subjective, so easy to be wrong, much safer to err on the side of overestimating than under. Especially when there isn&#39;t tangible evidence of how widespread it is. It wasn&#39;t really apparent in the Donbas War or Syria, there was no way to know how bad it actually was until they went to war on a very large scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Morale is hard to quantify. Also, Western inteligence didn&#39;t know that Russian troops would find out that they are in Ukraine when they read the road signs. In contrast, US took months to prepare for Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or doctrine. They showed off some skills in the Donbas War THAT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF WESTERN DEFENSE EXPERTS. It was believed those skills (involving combined arms warfare, mostly fires and targeting) were both universal and capable of being done on the fly. But nope, definitely not universal, and only as part of highly planned, centralized, set piece battles that didn&#39;t characterize the first month and a half of the war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The entire greyzone/hybrid concept that was supposed to be the new doctrine.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then there were other factors that NOBODY could have foreseen because they make no sense.  </p>\n\n<p>That Russian wouldn&#39;t include its conscripts in the order of battle, despite making up about 1/3 of their manpower. That Russia would allow contract troops to resign at will. That the Russians would stage on the border of Ukraine for months and not actually take the time to prep and train. That the Russians would purposely withhold knowledge of the invasion of their own forces until 1-2 days prior, leaving no time to train, plan, prep, rehearse. That the entire invasion would be predicated on stated assumptions of &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they won&#39;t give back, they&#39;ll welcome you as liberators.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe that the best of KGB left a long time ago. In fairness US believed that Iraqould welcome then after half a million Iraqi kids died becaue they couldn&#39;t import medicines due to sanctions. Remember the famous Madeleine Albright  interview?</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "For the past couple of weeks the question of sending MBTs to Ukraine has become a major political issue, and a lot of public debate and perception has focused on Leopard 2s and the perceived German unwillingness to send them. I believe the debate somewhat misses the point if one has not done one's homework in realistically assessing Ukraine's quantitative needs, and whether these can actually be met with Leopard 2s alone (or primarily).\n\nI believe that there is good evidence that there aren't actually enough expendable Leopards to get even close to meeting Ukraine's demands, so it will either have to come down to sending Abrams along with whatever Leopards are available (hence Scholz' insistence of the US also sending tanks maybe not being as despicable a move as everyone seems to think it is), or - hear me out: **an Abrams ring swap with Poland.**\n\nSo let's dive into the details:\n\n**Ukraine's needs**\n\nZaluzhnyi has famously stated that he needs 300 MBTs to retake lost territory. Depending on Russia's mobilisation efforts and how long it takes for donated tanks to arrive in Ukraine in numbers, that number may well rise. Either way, a moderate three digit number of tanks will have to find its way into Ukraine.\n\n**Leopard 2 availability**\n\nExact numbers are hard to come by, but there currently are between 2,500 and 3,000 Leopard 2s in service around the world. This has prompted many people to suggest that surely a couple hundred must be available to be sent to Ukraine, but that is unlikely to be the case. From the get go we can exclude operators such as Indonesia, Qatar, Hungary or Chile, which have rendered no substantial support to Ukraine so far and are unlikely to do so in the future. Austria has also ruled out sending theirs, and countries like Slovakia or the Czech Republic have just started to receive Leopards in exchange for giving their own Soviet MBTs to Ukraine, so they are also unlikely to immediately pass them on.\n\nThat leaves a couple of smaller countries with correspondingly small fleets (Finland, Portugal, Denmark, Norway ...) and a few major operators of Leopard 2s in Europe: Germany, Greece, Turkey, Switzerland, Poland and Spain with at least 200 units each. Between them, these countries are in possession of the vast majority of Leopards in existence (close to 2,000), and the bulk of MBTs would clearly have to come from them. So let's take a look at how realistic donations would be.\n\nFrom the get go, Turkey (unwilling) and Switzerland ('neutral') are out. Greece is an almost certain 'No' due to the situation with Turkey. As of yesterday, Spain is currently ruling out sending Leopard 2s. That leaves only Germany and Poland. Poland has already given hundreds of T-72s, and in regards to Leopards recently talked about contributing about 'a dozen at most'. So let's look at Germany.\n\nGermany officially had 266 units; an increase to 328 units was decided last year, but at the same time over the past year several dozens have been committed to other countries under the framework of the ring swap. In addition, the poor state of the German army is well known, and as of 2020 only 115 were fit for service. That number may be a little higher by now, but certainly nowhere close to 266. A bunch are at the manufacturer being upgraded to A7V standards, others are needed for NATO commitments, more again used for training to maintain capabilities. The last bit in particular is often overlooked by people enthusiastically proclaiming that X country should just send all or most of Y weapons system to Ukraine, after all they are protected by NATO, without realising that if that system goes the military immediately starts suffering from a loss of skill because there is nothing to train and exercise on. If Germany suddenly gave many Leopards away, it would take years for KMW (which is already straining under several contracts) to refill them.\n\nSo how many Leopards could Germany realistically contribute? 20? 30? With Finland's and Poland's contribution, as well as whatever e.g. Norway and Denmark could spare, what would we end up with? 90? 100? 120? Certainly nowhere near the 200+ Ukraine would need to make a difference.\n\n**So where do we go from here?**\n\nOne solution is obvious: send Abrams. The excuses made so far have been focusing on 'gas-guzzling', difficult maintenance, the depleted uranium armour etc. How much of that is accurate, and how much is overblown (someone familiar with operating Abrams already chimed in a couple of days ago, saying that it doesn't use nearly as much gas as claimed when operated correctly) I cannot personally assess. But one thing is obvious: if not enough Leopards are found, Abrams will be necessary.\n\nThere is a second option tough: have a major Leopard operator donate all of theirs, and backfill with Abrams. Most operators have no interest in getting Abrams, or it would take quite a long time to get the process going, but there is one country that has already committed to and started the process: Poland.\n\nPoland is currently acquiring vast numbers of Korean K2 and American Abrams to replace all PT-91s and - eventually - their 249 Leopards. If the US agreed to accelerate deliveries and training of Polish forces, and station Abrams units in Poland until deliveries have been completed, there would be no gap in Poland's defence and Polish troops could continue to train on their new tank model, with no skills being lost. At the same time Ukraine would be getting enough MBTs (in conjunction with whatever Germany, Finland and other countries can spare), and no one would lose out. The US would bear the brunt of the logistical challenge, but other countries could chip in financially. Edit: In fact, a chunk of it could be covered by EU funds in order to pre-empt the unavoidable 'the US is paying for Europe's defence again' complaints.\n\nIt seems like a rather obvious solution to me, but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.",

As you probably know from cars and bicycles, lower gears give you more torque and get you moving from standstill, but don't give you a lot of speed. Tanks get into difficult and muddy offroad situations very often (the times you need to reverse are disproportionately these); so for reverse, lower gears are the highest priority.

They are responsible for seizing objectives in the enemy's operational rear, bypassing centers of resistance, defeating the enemy in detail, and collapsing the enemy line by cutting them off from resupply and reinforcements.

Then the S-400 seems to have similar to better on-paper performance to recent Patriots, and in practice it could be a fair bit better or a little worse (again, very hard to know without access to classified reports from both sides). It uses a wider variety of missiles, which optimizes its performance against specific types of threats, but also makes it more logistically difficult to run and can mean that the crew runs out of the specific missile quicker if there&#39;s a concentrated attack. Russians are believed to be behind on radar technology overall, but with GBAD the size and the chosen radar band can more than make up for that in some contexts.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I'll go out on a limb and wonder if there's potential for negotiations in the near future closer than we think? This is all obviously speculation, but I've been just collating a lot of information floating out there and putting together an interesting picture of the war being over sooner rather than later.  \n\n\n1. Everyone is assuming the recent push for weapons shipments has been about preparing for either staving off a Russian counter-offensive or launching a new Ukrainian offensive in the spring. Those are both fair assumptions, but what if the weapons are being sent to try and create a situation of significant conventional deterrence ahead of a potential negotiation? In a New York Times article published within the last few days re: the UK and sending tanks: \u201c*In a closed-door session of his \\[NSC\\] on Tuesday, Mr. Sunak outlined a strategy to increase support for Ukraine, likely beginning with the tanks,* ***to give Kyiv an edge ahead of any possible peace negotiations****, according to another senior European official\u201d* A very interesting choice of words right there from the source. Now that could just be Sunak selling it, but it fits the idea that maybe what we're seeing is arming Ukraine for peace/stalemate, not continued war.\n2. Yesterday, the NYT ran an article about how the US might be \"warming\" to the idea of taking Crimea. It was an odd article because it felt most likely speculation and a bit out of place seeming that the US is continuing to maintain a rather forceful policy of studied ambiguity, if not outright \"no\", on Crimea. But, if the US wanted Russia to feel that the pressure is boiling re: Crimea and it might be best for them to come chat to avoid that outcome, it's not the worst way to start that process. Adding to that, the article made it clear that the admin was apparently thinking the risk of Russian nuclear escalation has diminished (a \"we acknowledge that you are rational\") sort of statement in my opinion.\n3. According to WaPo, Burns met with Zelensky today to discuss \"how long Ukraine could expect US and Western assistance to continue following Republicans' takeover of the House and the drop-off in support of Ukraine aid among parts of the US electorate...\" A difficult conversation to have, but what if the underlying pressure here is that it's time to bring about an end to the war before Ukraine can't prosecute it as efficiently any more? What if Burns is there not to just discuss the tapering off of US aid, but to lay the groundwork for negotiations while Ukraine is sitting a position of strength, as opposed to later on? This would merge with the idea of sending more equipment now, in short, reinforcing the strength of Ukraine before potential negotiations. The recent (if relatively small) military setbacks for Ukraine might also have acted as a bit of a jarring moment for the Ukrainian leadership, a very very clear indication that they won't always be getting everything their way.\n4. From the Russian perspective, it's clear that they think they can still \"win\" the war. But there's no denying that sanctions, mobilization, and leadership instability (barring Putin) are putting them in an increasingly difficult position both internally and internationally. The speculation on the street is that Russia will be launching a new round of mobilization for a long war. Again, that's a perfectly plausible explanation, but what if, much like the West, Russian is trying to present a position of strength to get to the negotiating table? A sort of \"We have not yet begun to fight\" messaging but with some serious chops behind it this time. All the noise in Belarus would actually make a fair amount of sense in this context. Similarly, the shuffling of leadership at the very top, putting Gerasimov in charge, combined with Shoigu's recent meeting, would all also add to this picture. \"We're putting our top man on the case now, grrrr\". It would also play into a further post-negotiation consolidation of power by Putin, saying that, yes the war has ended but Russia's enemies are clear now, it's us or them, and we must now reinforce against all challengers etc etc. \n5. Communication lines are still open and chats are happening. Putin and Erdogan spoke only a few days ago. Putin and Xi spoke within the last three weeks or so. Lower level US officials and Russian officials are still talking. So it's not impossible that negotiations could happen.  \n\n\nAgain, this is pretty blatant speculation on my part, but it is interesting and not entirely outside the realm of possibility. A lot of it is predicated on Rishi Sunak's apparent discussion in the meeting. But I do wonder if both countries will see an interest in negotiating before having to go through the punishing process of spring offensives.",

They'd accept negotiations by annexing half of Ukraine and leaving the other half in a Belarusian like state of being, for however long that's convenient. \n\nThe Ukrainians haven't fought this hard and long to give up now. The west hasn't been supporting Ukraine this long to admit defeat in some form. \n\n\nThe minimal negotiations for Ukraine would be a withdrawal to February 24th borders, and an openness to create a solution to crimea and Donbas. \n\nThis is impossible for Russia, because by doing so they would have to withdraw from annexed regions, essentially admit defeat, and very keenly, betray every premise of the invasion. \n\nThe minimal for Russia is an acceptance of the annexation of occupied territories, a withdrawal of non occupied annexed territories, a permanent neutral Ukraine, and most likely a change of Ukrainian government. \n\nThis is impossible to Ukraine. Doing so means essentially giving up its statehood and sovereignty, which they have shown to be able to fight for.

I'm guessing the game is to avoid a nuclear war, and to avoid a collapse of Russia, while generally supporting and hoping towards the best Ukrainian outcome. Obviously NATO going in and destroying all of Russian armed forces is unacceptable. Apparently supporting Ukrainian forces is acceptable. In this game, timing matters. The longer it takes for Russia to fail in Ukraine, the less likely Russia will collapse as they will have time to prepare for defeats and setbacks. The slower they escalate, the more likely cooler heads will prevail and prevent a nuclear war. The long game is honestly the best thing the west wants because the longer it goes on the more stable things are, and the strategy favors the west.

There is an obvious, comprehensive rot in the Russian Armed Forces that this war has clearly highlighted. This is not an individual opinion, but rather I would argue a widely held consensus among a lot of major analysts. This is not to say that Russian is toothless, they most certainly are not, but every branch of the Russian military have underperformed in this conflict for the last 11 months without question. Their best formation is arguably a private mercenary army. These are not the symptoms of just a misapplication of resources, if we can even call the initial invasion that considering that Russian threw tens of thousands of its best soldiers at the Ukrainians right from the start. Add to that the fact that you assume Russia is learning from their folly, when in fact the trend seems to be the opposite. Shoigu's recent military announcements are honestly a step backwards in terms of military reform, quite probably a kneejerk reaction to the disastrous performance on the field. See Dara Massicot's relatively straightforward thread about that here: https://twitter.com/MassDara/status/1615757546270216192?s=20&t=OxlPkDKff6omoOmAfw0xtg",

This was not a matter of the Russians being bad at the top and it was all a leadership blunder. There is an obvious, comprehensive rot in the Russian Armed Forces that this war has clearly highlighted. This is not an individual opinion, but rather I would argue a widely held consensus among a lot of major analysts. This is not to say that Russian is toothless, they most certainly are not, but every branch of the Russian military have underperformed in this conflict for the last 11 months without question. Their best formation is arguably a private mercenary army. These are not the symptoms of just a misapplication of resources, if we can even call the initial invasion that considering that Russian threw tens of thousands of its best soldiers at the Ukrainians right from the start. Add to that the fact that you assume Russia is learning from their folly, when in fact the trend seems to be the opposite. Shoigu&#39;s recent military announcements are honestly a step backwards in terms of military reform, quite probably a kneejerk reaction to the disastrous performance on the field.

The Eurofighter comes to mind, but the Leo2 also benefited from considerable tech sharing with the US & France. \n\nIf you introduced a free market approach across Europe, it would be likely that a lot of national industries would lose out against the big names, eg. Rheinmetall or Dassault. And you have that problem again if you open the market fully to American products as well. Instead Europe focuses on protectionism, and as a result props up inefficient industries which cannot compete and instead only increase the costs and practical difficulties.\n\nI would use SAAB as an example here. Is the Gripen better than the F-16? Probably. Its also more expensive too, largely because it cant compete on scale. Is it better than the Rafale? I doubt it.

The Eurofighter comes to mind, but the Leo2 also benefited from considerable tech sharing with the US &amp; France. </p>\n\n<p>If you introduced a free market approach across Europe, it would be likely that a lot of national industries would lose out against the big names, eg. Rheinmetall or Dassault. And you have that problem again if you open the market fully to American products as well. Instead Europe focuses on protectionism, and as a result props up inefficient industries which cannot compete and instead only increase the costs and practical difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>I would use SAAB as an example here. Is the Gripen better than the F-16? Probably. Its also more expensive too, largely because it cant compete on scale. Is it better than the Rafale? I doubt it.

Back in 2020, 11 of the 28 European member states we already at or above the 2% goal with another 4 at at least 1.8%. So, that's already the majority of countries either at or within striking distance of the 2024 goal of 2%. If you look at the change in expenditure as a percentage of GDP since 2014, then project that forward for '21->'24 (rough approach, obviously), in '24, 13 countries will remain below 2% which is not the majority. If you look at something like the delta from '19->'20 rather than '14->'20, things look even better for member states making their commitment in '24. None of this accounts for things like: \n\n1. Drop in GDP because of COVID which will totally warp these numbers _toward_ EU member states making their goals (GDP drop obviously increases military expenditure as a % of GDP is the expenditures remain stable). \n2. Increased investment as a result of the latest Russian aggression\n3. Doesn't count expenditure on direct Ukrainian aid since the beginning of the war (well, the continuation of Crimean war?). \n\nTrump was flat out wrong to call member states \"delinquent.\" He said that crap back in '16 when member states still had 8 years to make their goals. He was (as per usual) _completely wrong_ on the facts, and I fear his bullshit has seeped into the beliefs of a large chunk of the American populace. Trump was trying to get us out of NATO, and he was willing to make up bullshit to help that cause. The entire case from Trump was a red herring. He didn't want NATO member states to invest more, he wanted an excuse to get us out, and his proclamations have little to nothing to do with NATO's standardization issues, nor does NATO member states' commitments from 2014. \n\nTo the extent that there's technological fragmentation, it almost certainly has to be the result of multiple states making individual investment decisions, so the whole \"free rider\" issue _should_ result in LESS fragmentation, not MORE. For example, the fact that France, Germany, and the UK are all over the 2% mark ... does that make you think there's MORE fragmentation or LESS (think: Leopard, Leclerc, Challenger)? If only one country were doing 2%, wouldn't that mean less equipment overall, but also less fragmentation? \n\nWhat am I missing here?",

They were made in the 90s. \n\nAnd while GMLRS certainly aren't new, the Ukrainians didn't have much in the way of long range PGMs before HIMARS and M270 showed up. The UAF had a limited number of laser guided artillery rounds, the Vilkha-M (their version of the HIMARS/GMLRS), and the Tochka-U (their version of ATACMS), but very limited on ammunition. Additionally, they weren't coordinating targeting, just hitting whatever they found that seemed important, primarily field HQs but also individual artillery pieces even. That changed finally in [mid June](https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/06/27/ukraine-starts-hitting-ammunition-depots-deep-in-russias-rear/), before HIMARS even fired it's first rocket, the UAF switched to a dedicated supply interdiction campaign, namely ammo supply points, using Tochka-U. \n\nThen HIMARS showed up with more launchers but more importantly a steady supply of ammo. But during the April-June time period, because they got complacent about threats to their rear areas, and because they didn't have a well set up supply system, it made them especially vulnerable to the interdiction campaign. \n\nSince then they'd had to disperse and better hide tactical level supply depots and to move operational level ones 60-90 km from the front line, which requires even more trucks to function properly since their routes are so much further to the tactical areas.\n\n>Also, what new cargo trucks?\n\nI'm not saying they sent new cargo trucks from Russia but worrying if they did. They don't even need actual military versions for their rear areas, anything that can travel on hardball could work. That means not only trucks, but also drivers, and what amounts to supply porters, to make their supply system work. \n\nThey've lacked those thus far,  within the maneuver units those jobs tended to go to conscripts since driving a truck and loading/unloading it requires no real skills. But they didn't allow the conscripts to be used in Ukraine. Nor did they have the spare manpower during the shadow mobilization time period. \n\nBut now they have roughly the same amount of Mobiks dedicated to the Ukraine SMO as they did conscripts, which I wonder if that was a coincidence. So instead of using them all as combat troops, they would actually benefit themselves greatly to dramatically improve their tail to tooth ratio and make at least half into support troops.

            "body": "I think there's one thing we can conclude from this and other posts: a Pacific War can no longer be won, only fought. I don't mean America is guaranteed to lose, only that no side can possibly outright win. If we define victory as either total capitulation (occupation of enemy territory, see Germany WW2) or a negotiated surrender (Japan during the same), then it's practically impossible to see either happening from a new Pacific War.\n\nChina nor America are Germany. They are too large, with a long coastline and an ability to retreat inwards in the event of an invasion, and plus have an entire ocean separating them. Even if the US landed 5 million soldiers on the beaches of China or vice versa: good luck holding those beaches against an endless wave of reinforcements or even more ludicrous: keeping those units supplied as they move inland. \n\nNor are they Japan: even if every coastal city is occupied, both can move their industries inward and keep the fight raging on. Both would fling tens of millions of bodies at the enemy, enough to certainly stalemate the conflict. Japan in 1945 was out of fighting space, people, and industry: they had the Home Islands and that was it. If America and the Soviets landed in the South and North respectively, the Tokyo regime would've been squeezed in the middle and crushed eventually. That's what defeated them, and why they ultimately opted not to keep fighting. It's also why China kept fighting Japan until Japan's surrender: even though China had lost most of the coast by then, they still had millions of soldiers to effect a balance of power at the front.\n\nI think the best way to think about the US/Chinese conflict is look further back to great power conflicts from the late 1400s to the mid 1700s, specifically with Austria and France. Due to tech constraints, neither side was able to ever deliver a knock-out blow, and so you had endless war with little to show for it. You had a few thousand guys chasing a few thousand other guys, while trying to siege fortifications that with the cannon tech they had, had to be starved out most of the time. Eventually, technological advances allowed Napoleon and the French to break through the malaise and defeat the Austrians militarily (several times in fact; his failures were political, not military).\n\nSo what does this mean? It means that with the present tech stack we have, a Pacific War will be extremely costly, indecisive, and ultimately not worth it; no reasonable person can say that Austria and France's problem is that they didn't try hard enough--they did, but material conditions dictated that victory elude them--until those underlying material conditions changed.\n\nMuch like advances in artillery, military, and industrial thought helped France overtake Austria, if we can find a way to bridge the ocean with extremely fast transports and expand a fighter's range (without relying on vulnerable tankers) to cover at least half the Pacific, then maybe the war might have an actual outcome. Until then: we shouldn't fight a war, and whatever concessions and negotiations China and America both make need to reflect that.\n\nOtherwise, I do see a war playing out like this:\n\n- Both navies suffer heavy casualties. The PLAN will have a better replacement ratio (due to better industrial strength) at least initially, but this will even out as the US refocuses its industries.\n\n- Both homelands suffer endless missile and air raids. China will suffer more initially as US missiles are deployed closer and have a better range, but like above, over time, China will catch up to reach parity.\n\n- Both sides will commit to joint ops complete with island hopping. It'll be the same brutal warfare we saw in the 40s, only far more lethal--entire units lost contesting for patches of dirt in the Pacific.\n\n- At some point, the war will have waged for years. No side can declare victory, the economies of both are in shambles, and there is no prospect for any sort of knockout blow. So they'll negotiate a peace: the US will get X islands, the Chinese will get Y islands, and in 10-30 years, we'll be back at it again, only warfare will get slightly more lethal in the meantime yet not lethal enough to deliver that knockout blow.",
