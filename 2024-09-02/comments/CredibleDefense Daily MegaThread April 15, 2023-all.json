I would be very surprised to see any to tell the truth- Any newly trained soldiers this month or next are surely headed to replacement centers for additional training, ready to step into existing brigades as combat casualties accrue.  Even the Offensive Guard has put up a no vacancy sign on their recruitment pages. \n\nThis doesn't mean that the list of new mechanized infantry brigades has slowed down.  As I have long foretold/speculated/straight ass guessed, the motorized brigades are getting their make over, regenerating as fully mechanized infantry. one of the clips above is of the 56th OMB's newly  formed tank battalion, armed with various T-72B3s and T-64s, and a week ago I posted members of the 58th operating out of MRAPs, not light skinned vehicles. For  those of you playing at home, that's the 56th,57th, 58th and 59th brigades.  This is an excellent development- few units have seen as much combat in the Donbas as the motorized brigades, but lacking in tank/artillery/protected movement vehicles, and lacking the deeper bench of the TDBs (3 battalions vs. 5-7), they've been a bit of a chew toy. With veteran cores and proper indigenous support, they should be quite competent.   Additionally, the predicted glide path of the Kalinouski Regiment into an official OMB is far enough along that we should expect formal brigade number in the near future.  There is some indication that the remainder of the International legion is on a similar path, having officially transferred from IM to Army control, currently designated only as 2International, but I have no definitive info.  Beyond that, none of the new brigades are on the line, they're all in extended training.\n\nThe Offensive Guard of the Interior Ministry is rounding into its final shape, though we still lack specifics. The National Guard has been gutted to the point that it no longer exists, every unit of which I am aware having folded into the NINE brigades of the Offensive guard. I have not discerned any homogenized structure to the brigades, with the only definitive info  being that the Guard now musters 40000 men, and that all of the western gear of note is going to the regular army. The Guard has defined themselves as Assault Infantry, but a clear definition of the term eludes me. They certainly aren't  a uniform horde of light infantry readied for a zerg rush, as at least six of the units folded into the guard were mechanized, it isn't just light infantry, and the IM had their own internal path to tanks, artillery and vehicles. I'm guessing, and that's really all any of us have here, is that the infantry battalions will be much like the later formed regular army equivalents, with a mix of old soviet IFVs/APCs, with a higher portion of MRAPs/IMVs, with artillery and Armor organized at a divisional/corps level to keep it from dispersal into small packets.\n\nOur information regarding equipment is more complete for the Regular Army, thanks in large part to the intelligence leak documents. I've had a longer time to pour over the structure/equipment pages of the leak and now prepared to define the leak as informative but not definitive. It's much like reading a news article written about a topic the occurrence of which you have first hand experience- More or less true, but all the errors stand out to you. As an example, I still can't find any evidence of a 37th Brigade forming, nor have commentators I respect (such as Jomini and Militaryland). I suspect that they mean the 31st OMB, which is forming but has an info footprint similar to other 'western supplied' brigades still in primary training (wholly Ukrainian units have facebook pages, twitter posts and fundraisers for the kind of gear the western trained units get up front. Once again, my impression from who asks for money and for what).  In addition, some of the allocations of equipment are wrong, or at least out of date.  The deeper I drill down, the greater my impression that the  charts were prepared based on best available info in mid February, and every slot on the chart had to have 'something' in it.  the chart has been much modified by time and equipment availability. Also, it tells next to nothing regarding the make up of the Ukrainian organized brigades, and there's gaps in gear being supplied by Italy, Finland, Sweden and France. So to summarize, information more apocrypha than bible, but interesting and useful. \n\nI have a few additional notes to pass along. The 32nd brigade, one of the '99 MAXORO' mounted brigades, is at least partially mounted on M2 Bradleys. All I have are photos, so I don't know whether we're counting a company, a battalion or a brigade, nor where they come from. All I can say definitively is that 99 of the original 106 M2s have gone to the 47th OMB, and that after completion of training for the 47th and the 82nd AAB (which got the Strykers), The US has continued training battalions, as well as continued artillery training on the M109. In theory, the 47th could have been shorted enough M2s by inclusion of some other flavor of command vehicles and a battalion scraped together for the 32nd, but we're way out on the speculation limb here. I'll drill down on this.   Also, while nobody has stated where the Swedish MV-90s are going, I suspect it is to the 13th Jaegers, as 1) The Huntsmen are in the hands of the Swedish trainers for at least woodland training, and these are the only Swedish trainers I know of, 2) the other specialized unit, the 82nd, is getting stykers (and perhaps Marders too), and it would be very odd to beef up one and not the other of the units not getting tank  battalions (the 82nd gets a platoon of Challengers, the Jaegers have no armor) and 3) the army isn't going to give a brigade tasked with fighting and moving through woods and swamps wheeled vehicles if it has any choice.  I can confirm that the 13th Brigade has no tank battalion (they may get a company later like the 82nd did), but has an extensive artillery group, and 4 mech infantry battalions, and I am 'informed', extra recon forces.\n\nI question the final destination of the German Marders. The leak chart states they are going to the 82nd  AAB in addition to the 99 Strykers, but I can't see it: AABs are 3 battalion brigades, and 99 + 40 would leave them seriously over mounted.  My best guess is that they're going to whomever gets the SV50s, to round out a western brigade, but as the destination for the Marders is 'off the chart', they were just dropped there to avoid people asking 'why aren't the Marders on here?\"\n\n\nThe US has continued their artillery school well after allocation of the 18 M109A6s the US has pledged. I  assumed additional Paladins were therefore in the pipeline, but as Italy just entrained a significant number of M109Ls  (out of storage, spruced up)  I am less sure- it's possible the training has been for the Italian weapons. Time will tell, but Between the Ceasars coming from Denmark, the Bravehearts from England, the M109s from Italy .the contract for Krabs being in full production and (rumored) the Archers finally coming from Sweden ,Ukraine is receiving well over 100 top end 155mm SPGs this month  alone.\n\nAs a final note, I am amazed and impressed by the sheer quantity of engineering/battlefield support vehicles headed to Ukraine from just about everybody in NATO. Someone with a suspicious mind might conclude they plan to drive over/through mine fields and fortifications.\n\nThat's all I have this week- sorry there's so much speculation, but the fog of war is thick and getting thicker-  so much more equipment is going to Ukraine unannounced, vaguely announced or purchased from brokers, producers or countries  quietly selling old equipment out the back door. And I decided to stop talking about where units are training or currently in bivouac .  Please feel free to comment, correct or interpret at your leisure.",

The IM was responsible for the National Guard, The Border Patrol, Paramilitary police forces (units guarding state facilities, power plants, providing a cadre of internal security forces to most cities. Gendarmerie). This bifurcation really isn't that odd, most countries have some separation between internal focused forces and external focused ones. A final component under the IM were independent volunteer units and organizations, such as Azov and Right Sector- They've existed since 2014, but the number of such volunteer groups ballooned with the Special Military Operation (sic).  \n\nWith this 'include anyone' ethos, Organization and equipage has always been chaotic, particularly when compared  to the well documented TOE of the regular army. The National Guard pre war had a number of organized mechanized units labeled 'fast reaction forces', regiments or small brigades, some mechanized, some motorized, as well as cadre units in most locales. They maintained their own weapons depots/ munitions bunkers to supply themselves, much as the Marine Corps and the Air Assault Forces did, and unfortunately, their own command structure as well. \n\nI've described the IM's organization as the 'wild wild west' at different parts of the war, as numerous units have formed. The equipage of these units was chaotic, a chaos only increased by existing National Guard 'Fast Reaction Forces' up-gunning themselves on the fly. \n\nBy all accounts, the chaos has finally gotten too much for the IM to bear. The difference in composition/size/condition of units became an operational handicap, and the ability to supply and service them did as well.  Several of the established rapid reaction brigades, ones with the best equipment, experience and staffing were transferred whole to the Regular Army, where their TOE has been modified/reinforced on the fly to conform them to RA mech brigades (the 1st special purpose brigade and the Presidential Guard Brigade being the earliest). The RA has also accepted the transfer of smaller independent units from the IM and incorporated them into forming brigades. \n\nStill, the lack of consistency was hampering the effectiveness of IM units. Some have even cited the separate chain of command as a contributing factor in poor performance where IM units were intermixed within a sector. (Tom Cooper is scathing on this issue, though to be fair, Tom's basic state is scathing ). \n\nEarlier this winter the IM came up with a plan to rationalize the mess. They announced the formation of the \"Offensive Guard\", 6 new brigades organized as assault forces for a spring offensive. The six brigades were to be formed around a cadre of existing IM groups, including the remaining rapid reaction forces and notably, the existing organization structure of the border guards and the Gendarmerie. Over time the IM has incorporated the remainder of organized National Guard units, the Azov volunteers and other independent groups and commands- several of the larger international units were transferred whole to the RA to be assimilated by them, and several additional brigades were announced.\n\nWith all said and done, What the IM has done is rationalize its forces, while augmenting them with a serious recruitment drive and discarding forces which didn't fit (the Border services and Gendarmerie weren't discarded, but their remaining units/structures are back to performing their primary duties )\n\nHow the organization is to be used is open to speculation. The fresh minted brigades may be parceled out to various sectors, where they would play a supporting role in RA offensives.  I find it more likely that the IM will be assigned a sector exclusively for the Offensive Guard for which they will assume primary responsibility. \n\nThe reorg has been, to my mind, impressive. The IM has stopped Hearding cats and formed a single structure, all while avoiding the admission that their way of doing business had to change. The reformed units have the structure and training to engage in offensive operations, though of a more traditional 'assault' force than the combined arms doctrine attacks the RA is hoping to produce.",

At the time of this article detailing his woes with Barclay&#39;s bank closing his accounts in February, he had already sent 100 vehicles to Ukraine, including the 35 Scorpions for the RA, 25 Armored Land Rovers for the TDF,  a whole lot of armored ambulances and an unspecified # of Scimitar ARVs- At the time of the article in February, a shipment of 15 more Scorpions and a couple tank recovery vehicles were heading out the door, and the charity Armored Turtle was raising funds for more.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.armoredturtle.org.ua/en/homepage/#about_en\">https://www.armoredturtle.org.ua/en/homepage/#about_en</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21655809/crowdfunding-buys-101-british-armoured-vehicles-for-ukraine/\">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21655809/crowdfunding-buys-101-british-armoured-vehicles-for-ukraine/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21336277/ukraine-brit-vehicles-barclays-axes-accounts/\">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/21336277/ukraine-brit-vehicles-barclays-axes-accounts/</a></p>\n\n<p>Seriously, how is one supposed to keep track of how many protected vehicles Ukraine is pulling together when you have random British farmers mounting entire battalions?</p>\n\n<p>The US may not be sending enough M2 Bradleys, but the regular supply of M-209  Buckets of Cash have been quite helpful for this sort of thing .</p>\n\n<p>((and there&#39;s a video where its noted that Barclays national did a slap down on Barclay&#39;s regional and everybody are pals again).</p>\n</div>",

While I don't think they're the same and disapprove of attempts by pro-China users to imply (or straight up assert) as much, it's difficult to actually *quantify* this difference. At some point one questions if some of these matters really are that different, or if there is some self-rationalizing taking place.",

While I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the same and disapprove of attempts by pro-China users to imply (or straight up assert) as much, it&#39;s difficult to actually <em>quantify</em> this difference. At some point one questions if some of these matters really are that different, or if there is some self-rationalizing taking place.</p>\n</div>",

Prigozhin published an essay on April 14 in which he argues that Ukraine\u2019s coming counteroffensive is more likely to succeed than fail.[11] Prigozhin warned that a selfish Russian \u201cdeep state\u201d (which he defines as \u201ca community of near-state elites that operate independently of the political leadership of the state and have close ties and their own agenda\u201d) is currently in crisis due to the Russian military\u2019s failures to secure a victory quickly.[12] Prigozhin accused members of this deep state embedded in the Russian bureaucracy of deliberately sabotaging Russian success in the war because they seek to resume their privileged lives of comfort.[13] Prigozhin stated that these Russian deep state \"internal enemies\u201d will push the Kremlin to \u201cmake serious concessions\u201d tantamount to \u201cbetraying Russian interests,\u201d including even possibly returning occupied Ukrainian territory to Ukraine over the course of a few years.[14]\n\nPrigozhin explicitly rejected the notion of any negotiations to end the war and urged Russians to continue fighting, even if it results in Russia\u2019s temporary defeat. Prigozhin stated that Russia must ignore the Russian deep state\u2019s temptations to cut Russian losses and settle.[15] Prigozhin stated the Russian military cannot stop fighting now despite current Russian territorial gains because the Ukrainian state has transformed, and unoccupied Ukraine is now politically opposed the Kremlin. Prigozhin stated that Russia must continue to fight relentlessly in Ukraine regardless of how adverse conditions become. He stated that any scenario in which Russia faces defeat will result in a groundswell of \u201cradical national feelings\u201d in Russia that will serve as the catalyst for a reinvigorated Russian patriotism and enable the Russian nation to undergo the baptism by fire necessary to emerge victorious and defeat Ukraine.[16] Prigozhin\u2019s essay is thematically and logistical consistent with his previous stated effort to transform Wagner Group into a hardline ideological elite parallel military organization to advance Russian interests.[17]\n\nThe Russian nationalist discourse about the acceptability of Russia suffering defeat in Ukraine deviates from some Western assertions of the need to preserve Russia from humiliation and allow Russia to \u201csave face.\u201d Prigozhin\u2019s argument that the Kremlin must resist the temptation to settle and instead remain committed to winning in Ukraine is not compatible with the idea that the Kremlin must be given a way to save face lest it conduct a massive, possibly nuclear, escalation.[18] It is noteworthy that Prigozhin \u2013 one of most extreme thought leaders among Russia\u2019s pro-war faction \u2013 considers that Russia can incur a defeat in Ukraine and that such a defeat in the short run would actually benefit Russia.  Prigozhin\u2019s comments, together with those of other radical pro-war voices, highlight the priority that the pro-war community places on galvanizing Russian society and energizing it for a long fight against the West.

However I think reviving their program is unlikely. It's unpopular with the Taiwanese people, and the US would likely pressure very strongly against it as well.\n\nBut no one has a crystal ball.

That\u2019s also putting aside the extremely elementary point that revenue and profits are not the same things.

As a counterpoint, I would look at the Chinese methodology of extirpating resistance as an example of counterinsurgency that does work.  Recall that the CCP began as a guerrilla movement themselves and are intimate with both the operation and underlying political considerations of an asymmetric conflict.\n\nTheir strategy consists of demographic replacement, deep penetrating security and surveillance apparatuses, and economic development.\n\nThe first is to destroy any possibility of ethnic self determination and develop a population loyal to Beijing that can acts as a local source of intelligence and personnel with native level familiarity with local conditions and environment.  China will move literally tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of ethnic Han people to settle unruly territories while assimilating the local population through schooling (for example, one must learn the Chinese language to participate commercially).  This negates the guerrillas advantage of better knowledge of the terrain and in fact alters the human terrain itself.  Half the population is reliant on the largesse and goodwill of Beijing and can speak the language, know where the best hiding spots are, and who was an outspoken ethno nationalist when they were growing up and are most likely to be separatists. \n\nThe second results in strict controls on the movement of humans and material within their borders, removing the guerrilla\u2019s traditional ability to ambush and advantages of choosing the time and place of engagement and position their personnel and assets as such.  This level of control is not possible in liberal democracies with free market economies.  Every single person can be tracked, each truckload of goods is assignable to a specific chain of custody, and lapses in security discipline as a result of collusion or incompetence which end in an attack on Chinese personnel will result in the imprisonment and deaths of those responsible.  With the advance of artificial intelligence and satellite imagery and drone technology, they can achieve atomic levels of intelligence granularity. \n\nThe third is to erode the guerrilla\u2019s source of recruits by providing opportunities for material advancement and incentives in exchange for loyalty and productivity, much like how Reinhard Heydrich in the Second World War managed to almost completely neuter the Czech resistance by raising wages of factory and farm workers.  It turns out that dirt poor common people don\u2019t really care that much about politics if they can secure a stronger economic future for themselves with the new administration.\n\nThese carrot-stick strategies on top of repressive military and secret police actions require consistent planning and dedication across decades but yields far stronger results than what Russia and the United States have attempted and failed to accomplish in Afghanistan and Vietnam.  You don\u2019t see serious independence movements in Tibet or Xinjiang and in a few more decades, any dissent will completely crushed when these places become 70% Han Chinese and utterly reliant on internal trade within the larger Chinese economic system.",

Every single person can be tracked, each truckload of goods is assignable to a specific chain of custody, and lapses in security discipline as a result of collusion or incompetence which end in an attack on Chinese personnel will result in the imprisonment and deaths of those responsible.  With the advance of artificial intelligence and satellite imagery and drone technology, they can achieve atomic levels of intelligence granularity. </p>\n\n<p>The third is to erode the guerrilla\u2019s source of recruits by providing opportunities for material advancement and incentives in exchange for loyalty and productivity, much like how Reinhard Heydrich in the Second World War managed to almost completely neuter the Czech resistance by raising wages of factory and farm workers.  It turns out that dirt poor common people don\u2019t really care that much about politics if they can secure a stronger economic future for themselves with the new administration.</p>\n\n<p>These carrot-stick strategies on top of repressive military and secret police actions require consistent planning and dedication across decades but yields far stronger results than what Russia and the United States have attempted and failed to accomplish in Afghanistan and Vietnam.  You don\u2019t see serious independence movements in Tibet or Xinjiang and in a few more decades, any dissent will completely crushed when these places become 70% Han Chinese and utterly reliant on internal trade within the larger Chinese economic system.</p>\n</div>",
