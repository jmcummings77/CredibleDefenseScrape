They suggest even that it\u2019s Russian&soviet doctrine! Which is horribly incorrect. Their objective is clear, if you check their posting history. They want to push the view that the Soviet Union never challenged the west and that, as far back as the 1980s the US would have won easily in a war with the USSR. One might have an interesting conversation about the relative strengths of the USSR and NATO, or where US& Russian doctrine has gone since the 1990s. But the poster uses a sledge hammer to swat a fly, and has repeatedly posts misleading or incorrect information. \n\nBy \u2018Yolo tank rush\u2019 they are clearly trying to suggest a more demeaning version of the Thunder Run, tho ironically if the two are the same then the US also does the Yolo Tank Rush successfully. Suggesting the problem is in execution not conception. But even larger the Thunder run is not a Soviet doctrinal concept. It wasn\u2019t American either, the Thunder Run has a rather complicated history. It started in Vietnam as a way to move armor over unsecured roads, it returned in the Balkans as casualties among patrolling units because politically unacceptable. But the real demonstration of the concept was the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and specifically the battle of Baghdad. In the US, the Thunder Run *has* become a doctrinal concept, as it requires intense coordination between armor, infantry, and air power. This was a lesson learned in Vietnam. \n\nObviously this is not a concept which would appear in a Soviet manual, they didn\u2019t find much they were interested in copying from the American experience in Vietnam (except, ironically, heliborne operations). Rather Soviet doctrine was all about aggressive and rapid action. They wanted to keep a future battlefield fluid, and then to capitalize on that fluidity by creating a breakthrough for them to exploit. Doctrinally the Soviets trained their commanders to approach an enemy blockage in four ways. 1) push through the obstacle: if a recon unit or the leading battalion of a regiment could push through resistance using a mounted assault, the regiment & division continue unimpeded. This mounted assault was *not* a thunder run, but a mounted assault. The goal was to close and destroy, not just squeeze through. 2) bypass and ignore: self explanatory, but better to avoid the battle entirely than to waste time & momentum deploying 3) dismount and launch a simple attack to overcome resistance 4) dismount and conduct a well planned set piece battle. 3&4 were only options when there was simply no other alternative or way around. \n\nRegarding operational concepts, it seems very likely that Russian doctrine has received only minor updates from its Soviet heritage. In the Kyiv battles we saw the same approach to combat, where units attempted to push forward rapidly without dismounting. But around Kyiv circumstances conspired to foil the Russian attack. Russian planning and leadership failed at a high level, but on the ground Russian units tried to flow south through ground that had already been cleared by recon units which had pushed far forward into Kyiv. There was, after the border battles, no firm frontline between the border and Hostomel, where the UA and TDF units established their Main Line of Resistance. Russian armor moved south and were very frequently ambushed and attacked by light infantry with ATGMs operating in close wooded terrain. If you go back to the above menu, there wasn\u2019t really a good option for the tactical commander in that situation. Ironically this is the exact scenario the thunder run was designed to solve. But it didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t Russian doctrine. So they struggled, inching forward, getting ambushed, dismounting, finding nothing, mounting up, inching forward\u2026. Until the entire northern thrust, which could not pivot to other routes of advance, turned into a massive traffic jam. In the Donbas and Kharkiv we see something very different. The UA put up a more traditional defense, and there the Russians followed Soviet doctrine. They tried to push through with forward elements, were pounded when they hit the enemy defensive zone, and then deployed for a conventional battle. \n\nThe whole conversation annoys me for two reasons. First it\u2019s a clear attempt to delegitimize Russian and Soviet doctrine to push a pro-American, pro-NATO line in which we are the undisputed champions and Russia is the undisputed loser. It makes the outcome predetermined. But history doesn\u2019t work that way, Kyiv was solve not because of a Russian doctrinal mistake (the Soviet manuals in the 1980s were *better* than Americans in several respects!) but because the Ukrainians fought hard and fought smart, while Russia did not. Second, the whole point of this subreddit is that users are informed on the subject and are posting accurate (as best we know). This facilitates a high quality discussion of major issues. The mega threads are obviously looser, but still. It\u2019s CredibleDefense, not NonCredibleDefense. This poster is just shitposting a take totally ignorant of the relevant literature, and has clearly never even thumbed through FM 100-2-1.

Colonel Kulagin said he was not aware of any intelligence documenting the presence of the launcher or drones on the Russian side of the front. But remnants of a drone that crashed near the town of Kupyansk, apparently after malfunctioning, proved the weapon is in use, he said.  \n>  \n>The weapon drops out of the sky without warning, according to Colonel Kulagin and a Ukrainian artillery officer who witnessed one of the strikes. It is accurate enough to hit a self-propelled howitzer in a spot near the turret where gunpowder is stored, setting off secondary explosions, Colonel Kulagin said.  \n>  \n>In such strikes nothing remains of the drone after detonation, he said. But witness accounts and the nature of the explosions, which were distinct from the damage caused by artillery fire, made the Ukrainian military confident in its assessment that the drones had been successfully deployed.  \n>  \n>Debris from the crashed drone indicated that the Russian military had removed its Iranian markings. The drone was mislabeled on a winglet as a Geran-2 Russian-made drone, Colonel Kulagin said.  \n>  \n>\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious problem,\u201d he said.

It&#39;s a unique situation that probably won&#39;t repeat, but has been very effective in helping key Ukraine units stay in contact despite jamming, etc.</p>\n\n<p>GIS ARTA remains a really novel and interesting idea, that clearly is working. I&#39;m hoping we learn more about that story promptly after this is all over.</p>\n</div>",

This typically means processing yellow cake into a gaseous form and using hundreds(if not more) of gas centrifuges. This process would also create large amounts of U-238, which is required for most devices as well. This takes a large amount of electricity, and produces a moderate amount of nuclear waste. Ukraine doesn't produce their own nuclear fuel for their civilian reactors, I'm doubtful they'd have a HEU program.\n\n> Pu-239 would be required. Typically this is done by building a dedicated reactor with short fuel cycle, then putting the spent fuel through the PUREX process. Spent fuel that has been through a reactor designed for generating power typically use a very long fuel cycle to maximum efficiency and in the process create Pu-240. Pu-240 isn't usable in nuclear weapons beyond a small amount, too much and it'll cause a fizzle. There is no (publicly) known way to separate Pu-240 from Pu-239. It may be possible that Ukraine has spent fuel that is usable for a weapon, but I wouldn't bet on it. If not it means building a reactor just for plutonium production. Also to note the PUREX process produces what I'd describe as devastating amounts of high level liquid nuclear waste, the process is responsible for the majority of the 53 million gallons of waste at the US Hanford site. Most designs will require tritium, typically this is produced in specialized heavy water reactors, then separated via PUREX. In the US the last dedicated reactor was shut down in '88, and due to the short half of life of tritium it needs to be regularly replaced. These days the US produces it at the Watts Bar commercial power plant using specialized fuel developed for the process and a dedicated extraction plant Savannah River Site. Deuterium is typically used as fuel in fusion/boosted devices as well.\n\n> Ukraine has known uranium deposits, as the Ukrainian SSR there was also heavy water production. I don't know if there is still any ongoing heavy water production. There was never any known fuel processing or uranium enrichment as the Ukrainian SSR. I'd be doubtful Ukraine could process the fuel and build a suitable device within a reasonable time frame. Taking a random guess five years may be possible with a heavy investment for fuel production. It's also hard to keep this sort of activity secret, especially as Ukraine is a member of the IAEA.\n \nThat doesn't cover a delivery platform or device design. No input on the other two questions.",

Do you even need a credible delivery vehicle, or would the threat of a nuke in a truck be enough to freeze? </p>\n\n<p>I have no idea and this is such an out there hypothetical that it&#39;s probably not worth the brainpower, but one must think about <em>something</em> on the toilet.</p>\n</div>",

That is a Jav hitting a cope cage would have *gained* capacity against the tank, not less. This is counterintuitive and so is very commonly misunderstood or misstated, even by people within the defense community. But it is this way for reasons of physics, most HEAT if detonated at the optimal range for penetration, would detonate a meter or more away from the tank\u2019s hull. So slat or statistical armor, which is never that fare away, will not meaningfully protect the vehicle. \n\nWhat it *can* do is increase the dud probability of the RPG-7, the most prolific AT weapon of the last 50 years.  Why has to do with a unique design choice in the fuse of the RPG-7. It\u2019s fuse uses two electrified crystals in the nose, if it impacts a target the crystals press into one another, complete a circuit, and trigger the charge. But if crushing force is applied outside the horizontal plane, there is a good chance the fuse crystals will become misaligned and fail to make a good connection. Thus the round becomes a dud. This is why slat armor is slatted, it\u2019s designed to catch and crush the warhead. If, however, the fuse crystals *do* accomplish their job then the slat armor has failed and provides no additional protection. Hence the name \u2018statistical\u2019 armor, it only increases the chance of a dud, but otherwise does not provide additional protection. In the era of the War on Terror, two or three KIA would make national headlines and was unacceptable. So it was decided that an investment should be made into even marginal protection schemes. \n\nNaturally outside the RPG family, there really arnt other systems that use this unique fuse mechanism. Newer RPGs also do away with that fuse due to its unreliability (afaik it can even be damaged during storage and use).

After all, nothing but the fear of nuclear escalation prevents the West from intervening more directly in Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",
