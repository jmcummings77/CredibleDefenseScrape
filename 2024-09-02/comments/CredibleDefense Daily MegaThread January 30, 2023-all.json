        "body": "This is my January check in for artillery assistance provided to Ukraine.  There\u2019s a lot coming in right now, much of which doesn\u2019t have firm numbers, but I\u2019ll do my best. \n\n\nThe US has provided 36 105mm Ultralights with armored tow vehicles, bringing the total provided by the US to 72: With the 54 provided by UK, 124 total (another ~14 105mm towed from other sources as well) there are 23 batteries, enough to examine doctrinal usage. The guns are primarily being organized into standard 18 gun battalions and assigned to the air assault brigades, in substitution of any 122mm component. The 105mm\u2019s lighter shell is more than made up for by its much higher rate of fire (fully fixed cartridges), superior accuracy, superior mobility and guaranteed munitions supply. \n\n\nWith the provision of the Bradley to Ukraine, the hesitancy to provide M109A7 Paladins has fallen.  The first 18 have been formally announced. I would expect future provisions to track with further Bradley/Stryker donations, at an approximate rate of 18 guns per 100 APC/IFV, but this is largely speculation on my part. \nBut it better be true: Europe is about out of guns in 155mm it can provide.  Unless the Italians really do have a hundred M109A4s in storage and are willing to get them out, the cupboard\u2019s pretty bare of SPGs which don\u2019t form parts of fielded armies.  Poland is presumably coming up with a battalion or so of guns, as they announced they would train and equip an entire brigade, but that\u2019s largely my speculation as well. There are outstanding pledges of German, French, Czech and Polish guns, but these are manufacturing contracts, which produce x guns a month right off the factory floor.  The Swedes are sending a dozen of their excellent Archer systems, France has ponied up another 18 Ceasars and both Estonia and the Dutch have shorted their standing army and sent everything they have,(Edit: I can't believe I forgot the UK with 28-30 Braveheart systems) but that\u2019s about it.\n\nI said this about ITVs/APCs, and I\u2019ll say it again about the SPGs: It\u2019s about the Americans. It\u2019s always been about the Americans- We\u2019re the only county in the western world that has surplus gear to give. And we better start providing it faster, as all this hesitancy over crossing red lines has led to a failure to field a single American SPG a year into this war. All this ink has been spilled on getting a couple hundred western tanks, but Ukraine needs about 500-600 western tubes today.  I know an operational decision has been made not to send more M-777s, but there are large parts of the line where shoot and scoot aren't necessary tactics, and the guns could be employed effectively.\n\nThere is one further bit of \u2018artillery\u2019 where everyone can be of help, and that\u2019s the humble mortar. More 120mm tubes, both mobile and emplaced are needed, but the desperate shortage appears to be battalion and company level mortars,81mm/60mm in US sizes. The Russians kicked Ukraine\u2019s but in Soldar partly because they have a ton of small mortars deployed forward and Ukraine doesn\u2019t- Someone else will need to answer this, but it looks like the dismounted mech troopers don\u2019t truly have enough of them, the motorized infantry battalions never did, and I can only image the shortage in the TDBs, and the \u2018Border Guards\u2019.  Somewhere around 3000-4000 more medium/small mortars should be pledged, gathered and air shipped yesterday, directly to front line units, as quickly as moderately trained mortar teams can be assembled.",

We see the opposite. We see that they are preparing for more war, that they are mobilizing more soldiers, more than 200,000, and potentially even more than that. That they are actively acquiring new weapons, more ammunition, ramping up their own production, but also acquiring more weapons from other authoritarian states like Iran and North Korea. And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine. So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for long haul. Because everyone who believes in democracy, in the rules-based international order, for us, it is extremely important that President Putin doesn't win this war. Partly because it will be a tragedy for the Ukrainians, but it will also be dangerous for all of us. It will make the world more dangerous. Because then the message to authoritarian leaders, also in this part of the world, also in Beijing, will be that use of force is the way to get what you want. And that will make the world more dangerous and us more vulnerable. So therefore it is so important that we continue to support Ukraine. I welcome the support from NATO Allies, from partners, and also from the Republic of Korea, and we need to be prepared. Let me add one more thing on this and that is that not all wars, but many wars end at the negotiating table. And most likely also this war will, at some stage, end at the negotiating table. But what we do know it that what happens around that table is inextricably linked to and totally dependent on the situation on the battlefield. So if we really want Ukraine to prevail as a sovereign, independent nation in Europe, then we need to support them now. Military support today makes it possible to reach a peace agreement tomorrow. But as long as President Putin believes he can win on the battlefield, he will not sit down and engage in good faith.

Ukraine will never have air superiority in the near to mid term because it\u2019s just not feasible. \n\nNot to disagree but to expand a little: [NATO defines four levels of aerial control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_supremacy). In order of decreasing control, air supremacy, air superiority, favorable air situation, and air parity. Currently, the Ukrainians are facing either air parity or a Russian-favorable air situation (in that Ukrainian air forces do not pose any substantial threat to Russian operations, whereas the Russians at least retain the ability to launch large scale PGM and drone attacks). \n\nRussia has something like 30 regiments of S-400 batteries (which corresponds to around 2100 missiles plus all the support vehicles, with an unknown number of missile reloads available), plus some ungodly number of S-300 batteries with likely more than 8000 remaining missiles. So it is unlikely they will run out any time soon, even with an aggressive SEAD campaign and increasing use of S-300s in their ground attack mode. It is unclear whether the S-300s pose a threat to F-16s, considering Israel's flawless record with F-16s against Syrian S-300s. It's possible the technical gap is sufficiently favorable to F-16s that S-300s don't pose a threat, but it is also possible that a competence gap between Syrian SAM operators and Israeli pilots explains the results and that a similar gap would not exist between Ukraine and Russia. But the Russians should have many orders of magnitude more S-400s than they will need to deny Ukrainian air superiority anyway, and they should be reasonably effective against F-16s. So yeah, air superiority, never mind full air supremacy, ain't gonna happen anytime soon.\n\nBut, the Russian SAM coverage only really matters if the Ukrainians try to operate within the Russian air defense boundary, either deep into Russian controlled territory or at high altitudes on the edges of their SAM coverage. Notably, the Ukrainians can still safely fly relatively freely at altitude in the far west of the country, and can fly low closer to the front. S-400s are known to struggle against low flying cruise missiles, and can only engage them at the relatively close range of 40km (versus 400km max for high altitude targets). The F-16 also gets the Ukrainians access to a vast supply of air-to-air missiles and precision strike weapons that fill capability gaps that NATO allies have been slow or unable to provide via a ground-launched platform (in no small part because NATO relies on planes for these capabilities). So the Ukrainians will be able to defend against more drone and cruise missile attacks with (functionally) cheaper munitions whose supplies are not as limited as, say, they are for PATRIOT batteries. Flying CAP in the west will also free up SAM capacity there for closer to the front. \n\nI expect we may also see the Ukrainians dropping JDAMs on Crimea from the Black Sea, if they can keep the BSF on their back heel. The payloads are much larger than the 200lb GMLRS warhead, so can be used against harder targets such as the Kerch Bridge, and the Ukrainians can skirt the ground-based SAM defenses by coming in from the sea and flying low to exploit the aforementioned weakness of the S-400.",

He crossed into Ukraine less than 10 days after signing his contract in July 2022, serving near Bakhmut, the frontline city in the Donetsk region. The mercenary group has emerged as a key player in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n>Medvedev said he reported directly to the group\u2019s founders, Dmitry Utkin and Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\n>He refers to Prigozhin as \u201cthe devil.\u201d If he was a Russian hero, he would have taken a gun and run with the soldiers,\u201d Medvedev said.\n\n>A fake press pass created under a false name by an NGO that helped Andrei Medvedev escape Russia.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Andrei Medvedev - the former Wagner mercenary who recently defected to Norway - has given an interview to CNN.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oslo, Norway (CNN) \u2014 A former Wagner mercenary says the brutality he witnessed in Ukraine ultimately pushed him to defect, in an exclusive CNN interview on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>Wagner fighters were often sent into battle with little direction, and the company\u2019s treatment of reluctant recruits was ruthless, Andrei Medvedev told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper from Norway\u2019s capital Oslo, where he is seeking asylum after crossing that country\u2019s arctic border from Russia.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey would round up those who did not want to fight and shoot them in front of newcomers,\u201d he alleges. \u201cThey brought two prisoners who refused to go fight and they shot them in front of everyone and buried them right in the trenches that were dug by the trainees.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>CNN has not been able to independently verify his account and Wagner has not replied to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The 26-year-old, who says he previously served in the Russian military, joined Wagner as a volunteer. He crossed into Ukraine less than 10 days after signing his contract in July 2022, serving near Bakhmut, the frontline city in the Donetsk region. The mercenary group has emerged as a key player in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Medvedev said he reported directly to the group\u2019s founders, Dmitry Utkin and Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin.</p>\n\n<p>He refers to Prigozhin as \u201cthe devil.\u201d If he was a Russian hero, he would have taken a gun and run with the soldiers,\u201d Medvedev said.</p>\n\n<p>A fake press pass created under a false name by an NGO that helped Andrei Medvedev escape Russia. The card was to serve as a cover should police ask for his identification in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Prigozhin has previously confirmed that Medvedev had served in his company, and said that he \u201cshould have been prosecuted for attempting to mistreat prisoners.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Medvedev told CNN that he did not want to comment on what he\u2019d done himself while fighting in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Wagner lacked a tactical strategy, with troops coming up with plans on the fly, Medvedev said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere were no real tactics at all.

            "body": "Doctrinally, AFV are rarely kept near the front lines during positional defenses. They're too easy to detect and destroy when static and don't provide much in terms of fires that can't be replicated by other weapons used by dismounted troops manning fixed defenses. So they typically hang back in turret down, camouflaged positions as a reserve, ready to react to breakthroughs or to help with counterattacks.\n\nAFV typically defend the front lines during mobile/maneuver defenses because the situation is more fluid, they can better utilize micro terrain for cover and concealment versus prepared battle positions, and they can rely on speed and mobility to exploit their strengths. \n\nOutside of this war and just modern ground operations in general, if enemy dismounted assault troops are the threat the best defenses to kill them aren't going to be tank or IFV weaponry (which often don't have thermals to easily spot targets), it'll be artillery, mortars, and other HE weapons, last-ditch being directional mines and frag grenades. Small arms and machine guns are best used to suppress dismounted attacks, hits and near misses that stop their forward progress by triggering a fear response, making them more vulnerable to HE weapons while they're stationary. Then if they move, small arms and especially machine guns can hit them. \n\nIf Russian dismounted squad to platoon sized assault units are making progress in Bakhmut or anywhere else and it's not because the lines are bare of Ukrainian defenders it's probably because the Russians are successful suppressing both the fixed defenses and the supporting weapons too. Being that they are known for heavy use of probing attacks and ISTARS, the likely reason for their success in suppression is because they identified defensive and fire support positions previously. Previous to an attack they perform destructive fire missions on them, trying to actually destroy equipment, physically wreck defensive positions, and kill maximum number of defenders. Then immediately before and probably during the dismounted attacks they switch to suppressive fires, meant for front line defenders and their fire support to take cover, giving the assault elements time to cross the kill zones in \"no mans land\" and get close enough to hit the defenses with their organic fires during the actual assault, which seem to be prioritized with bunker busting capabilities. \n\nMy guess is they're probably doing many of those assaults during hours of limited visibility (night), courtesy of better assault troops having night vision equipment that is given to VDV and better Wagner units.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Doctrinally, AFV are rarely kept near the front lines during positional defenses. They&#39;re too easy to detect and destroy when static and don&#39;t provide much in terms of fires that can&#39;t be replicated by other weapons used by dismounted troops manning fixed defenses. So they typically hang back in turret down, camouflaged positions as a reserve, ready to react to breakthroughs or to help with counterattacks.</p>\n\n<p>AFV typically defend the front lines during mobile/maneuver defenses because the situation is more fluid, they can better utilize micro terrain for cover and concealment versus prepared battle positions, and they can rely on speed and mobility to exploit their strengths. </p>\n\n<p>Outside of this war and just modern ground operations in general, if enemy dismounted assault troops are the threat the best defenses to kill them aren&#39;t going to be tank or IFV weaponry (which often don&#39;t have thermals to easily spot targets), it&#39;ll be artillery, mortars, and other HE weapons, last-ditch being directional mines and frag grenades. Small arms and machine guns are best used to suppress dismounted attacks, hits and near misses that stop their forward progress by triggering a fear response, making them more vulnerable to HE weapons while they&#39;re stationary. Then if they move, small arms and especially machine guns can hit them. </p>\n\n<p>If Russian dismounted squad to platoon sized assault units are making progress in Bakhmut or anywhere else and it&#39;s not because the lines are bare of Ukrainian defenders it&#39;s probably because the Russians are successful suppressing both the fixed defenses and the supporting weapons too. Being that they are known for heavy use of probing attacks and ISTARS, the likely reason for their success in suppression is because they identified defensive and fire support positions previously. Previous to an attack they perform destructive fire missions on them, trying to actually destroy equipment, physically wreck defensive positions, and kill maximum number of defenders. Then immediately before and probably during the dismounted attacks they switch to suppressive fires, meant for front line defenders and their fire support to take cover, giving the assault elements time to cross the kill zones in &quot;no mans land&quot; and get close enough to hit the defenses with their organic fires during the actual assault, which seem to be prioritized with bunker busting capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>My guess is they&#39;re probably doing many of those assaults during hours of limited visibility (night), courtesy of better assault troops having night vision equipment that is given to VDV and better Wagner units.

Early on in the Ukraine war there was a dearth of info about it's use, and like the role of airpower because it wasn't obvious or heavily reported on many believed it wasn't happening.

The Russians know when their comms and drones can't be operational because they're planning the attacks, so they can time it when they think the Ukrainians will be heavily vulnerable on comms, drones, radars, etc. At the designated time Russian forces lands their drones, temporarily powers off their radios, then every EW unit turns on for set time period, fries the UAF drones in the general area, jams their GPS, radios, radars, etc, allowing the Russian forces to take immediate advantage. They could even have planned to still advance while they're out of comms, knowing the enemy is deaf too it won't be a surprise like it would be to the Ukrainians. Then only minutes later they cut EW equipment off, turn comms back on, relaunch their drones, and they have total electronics spectrum superiority as the Ukrainians deal with the tactical emergency. Then they do it again 43 minutes later. Then 77 minutes after that time. Then 29 minutes later. Etc.\n\nThat's a guess. All I know is that the Ukrainians are the ones who have been reporting how successful Russian EW use is. Without drones, they can't get accurate fires or conduct Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR). Without GPS they can't get accurate fire missions and it's possible (though I'm not sure) that GPS guided PGMs might lose accuracy. Without functioning counterbattery radars, they can't track Russian fire missions. Without radios, especially the Motorolas they're reliant at the company level and under, they can't report problems, coordinate, plan counterattacks, know what sector is being overrun, etc. \n\nSources:\n\n[(July) RUSI report: Ukraine at War: Paving the Road From Survival to Victory](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/ukraine-war-paving-road-survival-victory) (Page 9 onwards)\n\n[(July) IEEE Spectrum: The Fall and Rise of Russian Electronic WarfareThe](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fall-and-rise-of-russian-electronic-warfare)\n\n[(December) Forbes: Russia\u2019s Electronic-Warfare Troops Knocked Out 90 Percent Of Ukraine\u2019s Drones](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/12/24/russia-electronic-warfare-troops-knocked-out-90-percent-of-ukraines-drones/?sh=704c4ac9575c)",

There are several million Chinese, they have honorless backstabing assholes and saints. Just like everywhere else. Saying you are better people then X is the very nazi thing that should be avoided.

China was able to operate for several decades, current restrictions have been started because of China's wilf policy and have been escaleted pretty quickly.

Overall all nazi talk is kind of bullshit in our current world thank god. But some dictatorship, China amongst them, are the nearest we have.\n\n> The government wants to convince you that Russia, China and Muslims are the bad guys when it's the US who wants global domination\n\nLol ... Yeah, US already is. russia status and actions ARE unprotactable! They are genocidong actively. China is genociding the Uyhgurs and \"reeducating\" the Muslims... , but it is true that some of the hate they get as a country is unfounded. Maybe do less of those that are valid. Muslims are a strange mix of race and religion. It is often unfair, but because of their size theh are full of radical animals and idiots. Also their religious tenents has parts that are unacceptable in a modern democratic world. (Many other religions have the same, they just ignore those parts, it is much harder with Muslims, but thats the situation) My point, there are many millions of them that have done nothing wrong, but the resons for the hatred against them by many is not some media plot. There are several reasons (same can be said about the US hatred)\n\nNow, sorry, I just had to reply on general. To your question.

But some dictatorship, China amongst them, are the nearest we have.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The government wants to convince you that Russia, China and Muslims are the bad guys when it&#39;s the US who wants global domination</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lol ... Yeah, US already is. russia status and actions ARE unprotactable! They are genocidong actively. China is genociding the Uyhgurs and &quot;reeducating&quot; the Muslims... , but it is true that some of the hate they get as a country is unfounded. Maybe do less of those that are valid. Muslims are a strange mix of race and religion. It is often unfair, but because of their size theh are full of radical animals and idiots. Also their religious tenents has parts that are unacceptable in a modern democratic world. (Many other religions have the same, they just ignore those parts, it is much harder with Muslims, but thats the situation) My point, there are many millions of them that have done nothing wrong, but the resons for the hatred against them by many is not some media plot. There are several reasons (same can be said about the US hatred)</p>\n\n<p>Now, sorry, I just had to reply on general. To your question. Yes, bots and paid users mostly and people who are tankies or nationalist Chinese.</p>\n</div>",

You&#39;d get a larger radiation dose from eating a banana for lunch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, it&#39;s depleted of other isotopes of uranium. U-238 is still radioactive, albeit  mildly but banana it isn&#39;t. Specific radioactivity of U-238 is 25,400 Bq/g. Banana is 18 Bq, so &quot;one banana&quot; of uranium is 0.7 mg, about a size of speck of sand. It is still pretty dangerous when inhaled because the alpha decay is very destructive. It has 20x &quot;dose equivalent&quot; factor of gamma or beta and alpha decay of U-238 is highly energetic, more than 5 MeV, in contrast to weaker (1 MeV) beta decay of banana potassium. Taking it into account, 1 speck of sand size of U-238 is &quot;100 radiological bananas&quot;. A cloud of uranium dust is still a radiological danger, not just toxic one.</p>\n</div>",

It's not fungible in the long term but various oil grades are equivalent in cost to refine and so they are only non-fungible in the short run as refineries are recalibrated.\n\nThis is not true for natural gas, as LNG and straight natural gas are not fungible commodities, are sold on different markets between different entities. Straight natural gas is not a fungible commodity because natural gas produced by different entities cannot be substantially interchanged due to shipping concern. It's the same way in which, for example, network interconnects are not commodities. Both of these are commodities in the very long term as infrastructure is built, but in the medium to long term aren't.\n\nThe lostt of a commodity which is a major production input for a buyer who doesn't control the market is inarguably worse in absolute terms for the buyer. You're confusing relative and absolute terms - the total impact to European GDP in absolute dollar terms of Russian sanctions on hydrocarbons is going to be larger than the impact on the Russian economy of these sanctions in absolute dollar terms. It's the same way in which Russia being banned from purchasing Western manufacturing equipment hurts Russia more than the manufacturing countries in absolute terms.

So why are these tanker movements being described as unofficial? Because that\u2019s what they are: a lot of them don\u2019t have declared end destinations, most don\u2019t disclose ship to ship transfers, and the ownership structures aren\u2019t clear. \n\n\nTo the actual article. This is a well written and more comprehensive article than most. However, there are 4 key points:\n\n1. Volumes have \u201csurged back\u201d to June 22 levels, but ignore three truths: volumes were down ~1.3mmbpd in December mainly for weather and uncertainty reasons that many shippers are only catching up on now, everyone is rushing to purchase Russian oil/products ahead of the Feb 5 ban and lastly, Poland and Germany halted pipeline sales, pushing Russia to offload more via sea routes. When crude sales were down drastically in December, I said they would normalize in January, and that longer term, seaborne oil might only be down 400kbpd on a forward going basis.\n\n2. On the 360 fleet: can only assume the Economist is talking about the total shadow fleet throughout the world because Platts last week estimated the number that Russia controlled was between 200-220 ships. How anyone (even the Russians) can come up with a precise number is perplexing. That 360 number would, again I assume, include ships that ferry Iranian and Venezuelan oil. And given that Iran alone is doing ~1.5mmbpd of crude (most of which heads to  China), the numbers make sense. ~200 Aframaxes aren\u2019t going to do anywhere close to the numbers that Russia needs, though they are constantly adding to their shadow fleet.\n\n3. If anyone wanted proof that the West wants to manage Russia\u2019s crude flows but not decimate them, this part of the article tells you everything you need to know:\n\n>Securing insurance has been trickier. Oil shippers do not just need to protect their cargo and vessels. Port authorities controlling passages such as the Bosporus strait also require protection and indemnity (p&i) insurance for the cost of harm ships may cause to people, property or nature. \n\nAs I mentioned a few days ago, ports are ultimately the point of control here that the West, and especially the US, has been unwilling to lean on. They can require more stringent standards from them overnight, which would destroy a lot of the gray market. Not only that, a lot of the ship to ship transfers are happening right out in the open: in Kalamata and Ceuta. Or in Greece and Spain, respectively. Both NATO countries, both part of the EU.\n\n4. These are the parties subject to a typical commodity trade: a buyer, a seller, insurer, shipper and, perhaps most importantly, the financier/trader. This article covers the first 4 well, but not the last. Your biggest/most sophisticated commodity traders are Trafigura, Vitol and Glencore. Their biggest counterparties in financing are investment banks such as GS/MS/etc. To simplify: whenever you have opaque or gray trading, spreads blow out. So, you pay button pushers more money on a per barrel basis than your entire cost of extraction. Now, some of these trades are happening at a sovereign to sovereign level, so the need for financial intermediaries is truncated. But most of it, presumably (India and parts of China,) aren\u2019t. Further, a lot of the 20-30 year old ships Russia has bought, and a lot of the gray trading, benefits numerous Western companies along the value chain. \n\n\nThe point is that, ultimately, the West has tremendous ability to inflict more damage to Russian crude flows, but has chosen not to thus far (and rightly so.)",

Remote ID broadcasts the operator\u2019s positions, as well as the position of the drone, whenever it\u2019s in operation... In May, Ukrainian drone operators discovered a software program that disables Remote ID, according to an operations officer in Ukraine\u2019s 68th Jager brigade who wished to remain anonymous. The program activates a simple command in the DJI firmware that switches Remote ID on or off. The drone officer said he was told about the program by a friend in another drone unit... [H]iding from AeroScopes is just one of the many ways operators can manipulate protocols for their own ends. Other open-source programs, for example, offer users the ability to create their own AeroScopes, or to mimic Remote ID signals to spoof an illusory drone storm.\n\nAs far as 30mm VOG-17 grenades go, I haven't seen a free fall time of less than ~3.5 seconds, which corresponds to a ~60m height. I assume this to be the minimum altitude for somewhat reliable (~80%?) detonation because 1) they don't drop them from lower altitudes even when the target is badly wounded/asleep or otherwise incapable of evasion or destroying the drone; 2) some [videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/10p1o49/an_attempt_by_the_russians_to_conduct_an_assault/) show grenades that don't detonate, and there must be many more instances of this happening that are never shared. [Aerorozvidka's page for the R18 drone](https://aerorozvidka.xyz/r18/) states an altitude of 100-300m for RKG-3/RKG-1600. I've paid less attention to those since they're less commonly used but it's likely to be somewhat lower than that if one accepts the tradeoff of some chance of unexploded ordnance.\n\nEdit: came across a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineRussiaReport/comments/10p9n44/ua_pov_large_ukrainian_drone_r18_is_shown_doing/) of R-18s dropping RKG-3 grenades that includes distance to target, which is a minimum of ~60m.",

It was voluntary and fairly peaceful dissolution where the Russia gave up territories and asked only one thing in return - peace. \n\nThat's some major historical revisionism right there. There were serious attempts by the Soviet leadership to hold onto power, but only once it was clear the jig was up, did they \"negotiate\" the withdrawal of their military from the many countries it had occupied for decades. It didn't \"peacefully give up territory\" it was expelled by the populations of the many countries it had occupied. Even that wasn't always peaceful too, as seen in the Baltic states. But it didn't just up and decide to peacefully disintegrate the way you claim, it 100% collapsed from the inside in a rapid chain of events. \n\nI also fully object to your argument that this was all done \"in the name of peace\" and that all Russia wanted was \"peace\" in return. It was done because Russia was unable to hold onto its satellite states any longer, full stop. \n\n>And the neocons succeeded as the US continue to push NATO's expansion to Russia's borders despite protests from Russian leaders, support terrorists groups inside Russia and groups that challenged various Russian governments.\n\nComplete and utter nonsense. Again, for the umpteenth time, membership in NATO is not something NATO imposes on other countries (like Russia and the USSR does/did), but its done diplomatically. The newly freed states of Central and Eastern Europe *begged* to join NATO as they were (rightfully) afraid of what would happen when a revanchist Russia regained the strength to attack them once again. Keep in mind, most of these countries have been *repeatedly* invaded, occupied, and repressed by Russia over the past 200 years. Just listen to how the Russians refer to the Baltic states, to Poland, to Ukraine, etc. They're seen as ungrateful breakaway territories and property, not as independent states and peoples allowed to decide their own fate. Russia doesn't respect the sovereignty of any state except its own. \n\n>In it RAND argued one of the ways to destabilize Russia was increasing provision of lethal arms to Ukraine. But they presciently cautioned the US to calibrate provision of arms so as not to risk Russian invasion. Here, again, the US failed as increased US involvement in Ukraine led to Russia's invasion. \n\nAgain, complete nonsense that puts the entire blame for the war squarely on the US rather than the country that actually invaded, starting in 2014. US provisions to Ukraine before the Feb 2022 invasion were entirely defensive and extremely limited in scope (HMMWVS, Helmets/body armor, small arms, and Javelins) and much of that didn't start in earnest until at least 2017. The aid Ukraine got pre-2014 was essentially non-existent. The US specifically didn't give the Ukrainians any kind of long-range weapons that could be used against Russia, or even any armored vehicles, it was entirely kit to protect Ukrainians from future Russian attacks. \n\nIt's hilarious how to people like you nothing is ever Russia's fault, including invading and occupying it's neighbors every chance it gets. Russia of course just wants to peacefully rule over the territory of other countries, if only the warmongering West would stop preventing them from doing so.",

            "body": "Not sure why you highlighted Brazil. Their trade with Russia is relatively unimportant, both in size and goods traded. And I don't believe anyone, let alone Rand, is under the illusion that sanctions alone will stop Putin. They'll certainly change the calculus in terms of war planning and ambitions in the Kremlin. If Putin and the Silovik were absolutely ambivalent to economic and political realities, he would have mobilized sooner, would possibly be mobilizing now, and wouldn't be taking active steps to play Robin Hood and tax the rich and powerful in order to increase social spending on the poor masses. The shrinkage in the middle class reported by the likes of FT and Bloomberg tend to have longer-term effects, as the tax base shrinks in every successive year, reliance on social safety nets increases, and from the resulting brain drain as the flood of previously upwardly mobile Russians flee their home. \n\nIn terms of sanctions effectiveness, it's perhaps helpful to break them into two subcomponents: 1) targeting and design, 2) enforcement. The West has done a credibly comprehensive job on number 1, but thus far been lax on number 2. Is that by design? It's hard not to think it isn't. There's very little reason to believe that think tanks and news publications can routinely find easy workarounds for the controls the West has placed, but the enforcement arms of the DOJ/USDT can't. However, beyond administrative zeal, it's also important to note that every evasive and obfuscatory actions Russia has to take to dodge sanctions enforcement, costs it not just in terms of dollars and cents, but also in terms of time and critical manpower.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Not sure why you highlighted Brazil. Their trade with Russia is relatively unimportant, both in size and goods traded. And I don&#39;t believe anyone, let alone Rand, is under the illusion that sanctions alone will stop Putin. They&#39;ll certainly change the calculus in terms of war planning and ambitions in the Kremlin. If Putin and the Silovik were absolutely ambivalent to economic and political realities, he would have mobilized sooner, would possibly be mobilizing now, and wouldn&#39;t be taking active steps to play Robin Hood and tax the rich and powerful in order to increase social spending on the poor masses. The shrinkage in the middle class reported by the likes of FT and Bloomberg tend to have longer-term effects, as the tax base shrinks in every successive year, reliance on social safety nets increases, and from the resulting brain drain as the flood of previously upwardly mobile Russians flee their home. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of sanctions effectiveness, it&#39;s perhaps helpful to break them into two subcomponents: 1) targeting and design, 2) enforcement. The West has done a credibly comprehensive job on number 1, but thus far been lax on number 2. Is that by design? It&#39;s hard not to think it isn&#39;t. There&#39;s very little reason to believe that think tanks and news publications can routinely find easy workarounds for the controls the West has placed, but the enforcement arms of the DOJ/USDT can&#39;t. However, beyond administrative zeal, it&#39;s also important to note that every evasive and obfuscatory actions Russia has to take to dodge sanctions enforcement, costs it not just in terms of dollars and cents, but also in terms of time and critical manpower. None of those are things Russia can afford to fitter away at the moment. So, yes, you&#39;re right. The screws can/should be tightened significantly if the West wants to maximize damage, but the lackadaisical approach thus far signals a hesitance which isn&#39;t that different from the hesitation on arms delivery.</p>\n</div>",

There's no way their military would actually be effective when the shit hits the fan in a real conflict.\n\nIn my opinion, this makes them a wildcard, not a surefire failure. History is chock full of examples of countries with a lot of experience getting their ass handed to them by countries with little or no experience. Two quick examples:\n\n- Japan stunned Russia in 1905, and in the 1930s steamrolled a huge portion of Asia. They had no experience in large scale international offensive warfare prior to this. \n\n- Germany built a navy from scratch and stunned the Royal Navy at Jutland. The Royal Navy was at that time the most powerful the world had ever seen with a cumulative ~300 years of experience in naval warfare and doctrine. \n\nAnd finally I will add that for what it's worth, the last time the US fought a war against a peer military was 1945. The US military is several generations removed from first hand experience of peer-to-peer conflict. It's all fun and games steamrolling T-55s in Iraq and dropping $200,000 smart bombs on Afghan cave entrances. Maybe being introduced to the business end of a DF-21 in the south china sea won't be as pleasant an experience. It's just impossible to predict right now, but discarding any PLA credibility out of hand is shortsighted in my view.",
