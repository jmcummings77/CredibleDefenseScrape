Will the arrangement here be to defer to the US on all defense exports in return for ease of defense export to the US?\n\n2. Will the UK and AUS also be expected to adopt ITAR restrictions on their own nationals in foreign (non-AUKUS) defense industries?

Excerpts:\n\n>Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration ordered a group of Russian political strategists to use social media and fake news articles to push the theme that Zelensky \u201cis hysterical and weak. \u2026 He fears that he will be pushed aside, therefore he is getting rid of the dangerous ones.\u201d\n\n>The Kremlin instruction resulted in thousands of social media posts and hundreds of fabricated articles, created by troll farms and circulated in Ukraine and across Europe, that tried to exploit what were then rumored tensions between the two Ukrainian leaders, according to a trove of Kremlin documents obtained by a European intelligence service and reviewed by The Washington Post. The files, numbering more than 100 documents, were shared with The Post to expose for the first time the scale of Kremlin propaganda targeting Zelensky with the aim of dividing and destabilizing Ukrainian society \u2014 efforts that Moscow dubbed \u201cinformation psychological operations.\u201d\n\n> The documents show how in January 2023 the Kremlin\u2019s first deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiriyenko, tasked a team of officials and political strategists with establishing a presence on Ukrainian social media to distribute disinformation.\n\n>By the end of 2022, after Ukraine pushed back Russian forces in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions and officials in Kyiv began to talk of a major spring counteroffensive in the east and south, Kiriyenko put together a second team focused on destabilizing Ukraine itself, the documents show. That effort was headed by one of his closest deputies, Alexander Kharichev, a bureaucrat known in some Moscow circles as the \u201cfixer\u201d or \u201celection handler\u201d because he ensures that domestic elections go the Kremlin\u2019s way.\n\n>At a Jan. 16, 2023, meeting, Kiriyenko laid out four key objectives for the Ukraine propaganda team: discrediting Kyiv\u2019s military and political leadership, splitting the Ukrainian elite, demoralizing Ukrainian troops and disorienting the Ukrainian population, the documents show.\n\n> The team\u2019s success was to be measured according to key indicators: They were to \u201clower the ratings of key personnel in Zelensky\u2019s office, the Ukrainian government, and the command of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces,\u201d and increase the belief among the Ukrainian population that the country\u2019s elite was working only for itself. \u201cA growth in the number of government dismissals and public conflicts\u201d would also be a sign of achievement. To increase fear and anxiety, Ukrainian war losses were to be exaggerated, the documents state.\n\n>**The documents show that progress was monitored at near-weekly Kremlin meetings, where the strategists gave dashboard presentations showcasing the most widely read posts they\u2019d planted in Ukrainian social media and tallying the overall distribution of their output.**\n\n>Among the material they highlighted was a fabricated Facebook post claiming that the family of a fallen soldier had not received any help from the state, which garnered more than 2 million views, according to one of the dashboard presentations.

The Kremlin then issued orders to create similar posts or \u201cadditional reality\u201d \u2014 a term used by Russian officials for fake news \u2014 including reports that Western leaders were looking for a replacement for Zelensky and that Zaluzhny intended to halt the counteroffensive.\n\n>Undeterred, the strategists planted a plethora of articles in Ukraine via social media, with one in May headlined \u201cZelensky is holding on to the throne.

The tactics in the European campaign included cloning and usurping media and government websites, such as those for Le Monde and the French Foreign Ministry, and then posting fake content on them denigrating the Ukrainian government, in an operation dubbed Doppelg\u00e4nger by European Union officials. They also included creating fake accounts on X, or Twitter, for prominent figures including German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. The strategists sought to place stories or posts from those websites or accounts on Ukrainian social media as genuine European reporting or commentary.\n\n> After the fake Baerbock account declared in September that \u201cthe war in Ukraine will be over in 3 months,\u201d the German authorities launched an investigation and found more than 50,000 fake user accounts coordinating pro-Russian propaganda, including those promoting the tweet.

They proposed distributing fake Ukrainian government documents as evidence of corrupt military procurement schemes, and suggesting that Zelensky and his family had Western bank accounts, the document shows.\n\n>The plans led to hundreds of articles and thousands of social media posts translated into French, German and English that targeted Zelensky, the document trove shows.\n\n>One article, for a French audience, was headlined: \u201cThe conductor has gotten bored of Zelensky\u2019s concerts: the actions of the U.S. in Ukraine lead one to believe that Washington soon intends to get rid of Zelensky, without discussing this with Paris.\u201d\n\n>On the basis of this article, one of the strategists ordered a troll farm employee to prepare social media posts in French saying, \u201cWashington will replace Zelensky with a more capable president.

The troll farm employees were asked to write comments such as \u201cWhy do Ukrainian generals hate Zelensky? PR out of the blood of fighters\u201d and \u201cTo shoot the exhausted president?

But they wanted to do that before the war. Even then, the current schemes don&#39;t give them the confidence they want to commit to it.</p>\n</div>",

But he reiterates that a new hostage deal with Hamas \u201cdoes not appear very close\u201d given the terror group\u2019s demands.\n\n>Yet \u201ceven if we achieve it, we will go into Rafah,\u201d he stresses. \u201cThere is no alternative to total victory. And there is no way to achieve total victory without destroying those battalions in Rafah, and we will do so.\u201d\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\\_entry/pm-stonewalls-when-asked-why-idf-didnt-enter-rafah-at-outset-of-ground-offensive/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pm-stonewalls-when-asked-why-idf-didnt-enter-rafah-at-outset-of-ground-offensive/)\n\nThe Qatari PM also offered his thoughts about a possible ceasefire and offered the idea that a ceasefire should not be conditioned on the release of hostages. Obviously it's a non-starter for the Israelis and was imminently rejected. So far any statement from the US has also called for a ceasefire only in exchange for a full hostage release. The German and British foreign ministers made some statements that indicated that they were also willing to accept a truce without a hostage release, so it will be interesting to watch how the US will act in the following weeks. If Israel starts a operation against Rafah it could be possible that the US also will start to call for a pause in fighting without a hostage release, so Israel needs to double down on the efforts to evacuate and protect Palestinian civilians.\n\n>Qatar\u2019s prime minister says that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas \u201cshould not be conditioned\u201d by an agreement on hostage release.\n\n>\u201cThis is the dilemma that we\u2019ve been in and unfortunately that\u2019s been misused by a lot of countries, that in order to get a ceasefire, it\u2019s conditional to have the hostage deal. It shouldn\u2019t be conditioned,\u201d Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani tells the Munich Security Conference.\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\\_entry/qatars-pm-says-ending-israel-hamas-war-shouldnt-be-conditioned-on-release-of-hostages/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/qatars-pm-says-ending-israel-hamas-war-shouldnt-be-conditioned-on-release-of-hostages/)\n\nIsraeli president Herzog today made a curious statement that went largely unnoticed. The Israeli seem unsure with whom they are currently negotiation and if the faction they are negotiation with actually has control over Hamas in Gaza or even knows anything about the hostages.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s difficult. **One has to make sure that we know whether there is anybody who makes decisions on the other side**,\u201d Herzog says.\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\\_entry/herzog-says-saudi-normalization-would-be-a-win-over-hamas-pushes-back-on-qatari-pms-hostage-remark/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/herzog-says-saudi-normalization-would-be-a-win-over-hamas-pushes-back-on-qatari-pms-hostage-remark/)\n\nA release from Kann news in Israel is also focusing on this point. The point was also discussed here in the subreddit the last time. If Israel is correct with their claims that Sinwar is no longer in contact with his fighting force how could he be in contact with Qatar-Hamas? And if Sinwar is not in contact with Qatar-Hamas it's likely that Qatar-Hamas simply throws demands at the wall, hopes that Israel accepts them and then later when a truce allows Sinwar to climb out of this tunnel he's willing to accept it.\n\n>First publication: Officials in Israel suspect that Hamas's excessive demands for a hostage deal are due to the fact that it cannot execute a deal - because of the disconnection between the military arm in Gaza and the political bureau of Hamas abroad\n\n[https://twitter.com/kann\\_news/status/1758918570136719731](https://twitter.com/kann_news/status/1758918570136719731)",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An update regarding the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. <em>Part one</em></p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu doesn&#39;t see progress towards a deal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He says everyone wants to reach another hostage deal. \u201cI also want it,\u201d he says, and it\u2019ll be \u201cvery good\u201d if this can be achieved. But he reiterates that a new hostage deal with Hamas \u201cdoes not appear very close\u201d given the terror group\u2019s demands.</p>\n\n<p>Yet \u201ceven if we achieve it, we will go into Rafah,\u201d he stresses. \u201cThere is no alternative to total victory. And there is no way to achieve total victory without destroying those battalions in Rafah, and we will do so.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pm-stonewalls-when-asked-why-idf-didnt-enter-rafah-at-outset-of-ground-offensive/\">https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pm-stonewalls-when-asked-why-idf-didnt-enter-rafah-at-outset-of-ground-offensive/</a></p>\n\n<p>The Qatari PM also offered his thoughts about a possible ceasefire and offered the idea that a ceasefire should not be conditioned on the release of hostages. Obviously it&#39;s a non-starter for the Israelis and was imminently rejected. So far any statement from the US has also called for a ceasefire only in exchange for a full hostage release. The German and British foreign ministers made some statements that indicated that they were also willing to accept a truce without a hostage release, so it will be interesting to watch how the US will act in the following weeks. If Israel starts a operation against Rafah it could be possible that the US also will start to call for a pause in fighting without a hostage release, so Israel needs to double down on the efforts to evacuate and protect Palestinian civilians.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Qatar\u2019s prime minister says that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas \u201cshould not be conditioned\u201d by an agreement on hostage release.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is the dilemma that we\u2019ve been in and unfortunately that\u2019s been misused by a lot of countries, that in order to get a ceasefire, it\u2019s conditional to have the hostage deal. It shouldn\u2019t be conditioned,\u201d Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani tells the Munich Security Conference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/qatars-pm-says-ending-israel-hamas-war-shouldnt-be-conditioned-on-release-of-hostages/\">https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/qatars-pm-says-ending-israel-hamas-war-shouldnt-be-conditioned-on-release-of-hostages/</a></p>\n\n<p>Israeli president Herzog today made a curious statement that went largely unnoticed. The Israeli seem unsure with whom they are currently negotiation and if the faction they are negotiation with actually has control over Hamas in Gaza or even knows anything about the hostages.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s difficult. <strong>One has to make sure that we know whether there is anybody who makes decisions on the other side</strong>,\u201d Herzog says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/herzog-says-saudi-normalization-would-be-a-win-over-hamas-pushes-back-on-qatari-pms-hostage-remark/\">https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/herzog-says-saudi-normalization-would-be-a-win-over-hamas-pushes-back-on-qatari-pms-hostage-remark/</a></p>\n\n<p>A release from Kann news in Israel is also focusing on this point. The point was also discussed here in the subreddit the last time. If Israel is correct with their claims that Sinwar is no longer in contact with his fighting force how could he be in contact with Qatar-Hamas? And if Sinwar is not in contact with Qatar-Hamas it&#39;s likely that Qatar-Hamas simply throws demands at the wall, hopes that Israel accepts them and then later when a truce allows Sinwar to climb out of this tunnel he&#39;s willing to accept it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>First publication: Officials in Israel suspect that Hamas&#39;s excessive demands for a hostage deal are due to the fact that it cannot execute a deal - because of the disconnection between the military arm in Gaza and the political bureau of Hamas abroad</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kann_news/status/1758918570136719731\">https://twitter.com/kann_news/status/1758918570136719731</a></p>\n</div>",

If you then look into the early hours of the attack you see a very coordinated attack, not only were Hamas forces at the correct place at the correct time but they also coordinated the attack with rocket launches, attacks from the air and even attack from the sea (which were mostly fought back, because the Israeli Navi was the only service branch not collapsing during the 7th October). \n\nIronically you see the centralized Hamas structure mostly during previous conflicts and \"peace times\". Hamas attacks or rocket launches against Israel were rare and Hamas was even able to control almost every Palestinian faction in Gaza. Even during the short 7 day truce where Hamas released around 100 hostages Hamas had good control over its fighters and no rocket launches occurred, going so far that the first rocket launch only occurred precisely when the ceasefire ran out. That's not a sign of a organization lacking control.\n\nAlso we are currently seeing the Hamas structure being dismantled. Rocket launches are down and Hamas seems unable to carry out attacks that are larger than a few guys running out of a tunnel and getting killed by the next Israeli drone.
