            "body": "Hi and thanks for posting the update.\n\nThe 25th Airborne Brigade is interesting. Its 3rd Battalion is in Novoselivske, in the Svatove sector, supporting the 92nd Brigade. Its artillery was spotted in June in the Velyka Novosilka sector in the South. I wonder at this point if they have taken their artillery battalion and moved it to the South, while the maneuver units are concentrated between Chervonopopivka and Torske in the Kreminna sector, and one battalion in Novoselivske. Let's recall Ukrainians complaining about lacking artillery firepower between Kupyansk and Kreminna in comparison to the Russians - the latters would have been saving shells for months before the push which started in late June. According to Rybar, the 115th Mechanized Brigade (one of those Ukrainian brigades formed at the beginning of the conflict that disappeared from any radar in the last few months) has been brought in the direction of Kupyansk, but there is no confirmation. \n\nI have heard about the Russian advances in Bilohorivka - they are positional battles, since April the Ukrainians have lost control of the high ground northeast and east of the village and now the Russians are pushing harder towards the settlement. The situation is more difficult since the Russians have recovered that part of the forest north of the Seversky Donets River. Nothing too concerning for the moment, but even in the very pessimistic case the Ukrainians had to give up the village I'm pretty sure it wouldn't jeopardize the Siversk salient. \n\nAbout the Russian reserves in Bakhmut, as far as I know they are bringing more and more elements of the 150th Motorized Division from the Marinka sector to the southern area of Bakhmut. Both the 68th Tank Regiment and the 102nd Motorized Regiment from that division are now in that area supporting the 72nd and 57th Brigades. They also moved the 80th Tank Regiment from Kreminna - the only Central MD unit outside the Svatove-Kreminna line. They also brought a BARS detachment from Kreminna. The 83rd and 11th VDV Brigades have been in that area for some time now, ditto the 31st VDV Brigade a bit further north, which according to what I had read a few days ago could have been moved to the rear now. Also there are the 4th Brigade and two separate battalions from the 2nd Corps and the 1307th Regiment from the Territorial Defense (Russian TD = mobilized regiments). All of this in the city's southern sector. They also brought reinforcements to the northern sector, which is why (also because Ukrainian units in the southern area are generally better) there was no more progress in the Dubovo-Vasylivka salient and in Berkhivka. One month ago the Russians brought the 217th VDV Regiment from Kreminna and the 105th Regiment of the 1st Corps to assist the 200th Brigade... And the 106th VDV Division is holding off the limited Ukrainian attacks from Soledar direction.\n\nParticularly in and around Klishchiivka there are extremely violent battles going on. Ukraine continues to fight without deploying reserves. Among the new brigades just the 22nd Mech was noticed (only artillery actions from it have been recorded at the moment) as well as elements of the Lyut Brigade of the Offensive Guard. The 3rd and 5th Assault Brigades have been the spearhead of the attacks; there is also the excellent 80th Air Assault Brigade in the area, which had been moved during February/March as a strategic reserve in case the Bakhmut flanks collapsed and has seen little to no direct action since then, is very fresh and is starting in the last few days to become the protagonist of the attacks around Klishchiivka as far as I see... There are also the 17th Tank Brigade which is supposed to be the operational reserve and the armored support in the southern area of Bakhmut and the 28th Mech in Kurdiumivka.\n\nAs for Urozhaine, I think they are referring to DPICMs... I read that the Russians attempted counterattacks east of the village and were repulsed. About Robotyne I have no updates since there was the unfortunately failed attack that cost the 118th Mech the loss of a company tactical group last week. And I wasn't aware of the 46th Brigade being active around Velyka Novosilka, I had them in the rear in the eastern part of the Orikhiv sector. Looking forward seeing them in action! The Russians have been pouring some new reserves into the area in the last week.",

Russian language is key.\n\n> Russia can't be content as long as there are Ukrainian regions where predominantly Russian is spoken and which haven't been annexed into Russia. **It's important to note that this isn't because the Kremlin seeks to protect the Russian-speaking population living there; that's nonsense.** Rather, it's extremely **challenging for Moscow to annex territories where locals don't speak Russian**. This is why they specifically target these regions; a Russian-speaking population is much easier for Russian security forces to subdue and incorporate into a greater Russia.\n\n> **Ukraine is aware of this, which is why they are making vigorous efforts to eradicate Russian language from their daily lives**. A population that **doesn't speak Russian is the only way to prevent future Russian invasions** (or make them significantly less likely).\n\nUkraine won't attain peace as long as some regions within its territory have a majority of Russian-speaking population.\n\nEven though the international community recognizes former Soviet states as independent nations, from Russia's perspective, they are not. The Kremlin perceives their independence as an unfortunate historical accident, with the long-term goal of restoring full control over them. A 2023 quote by Lu Shaye, China\u2019s ambassador to France, [*\"countries in eastern Europe that gained independence following the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991 did not have \u201ceffective\u201d sovereign status in international law\"*](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-europe-anger-sovereignty-ex-soviet-states-ukraine-russia-rcna81072) is just explicitly saying what Moscow believes to be true.\n\nThis explains why the abandonment of the Russian language in former Soviet states triggers Moscow. If the population of these states ceases to speak Russian, it becomes incredibly difficult for Russia to annex those territories. That's why the Kremlin is determined to exert all the pressure it can muster, up to and including an implicit threat of invasion and annexation (implicit threats were no longer working on Ukraine), against former Soviet states.\n\nNotably, to the best of my knowledge, the process of Ukrainianization has been progressing slowly but steadily since 2014.

        "body": "Ukraine's targeting of landing ships is interesting. In part, the ships could simply be targets of opportunity as Ukraine tries to generally push the Russians farther and farther west in the Black Sea, [a phenomenon GeoConfirmed describes well here](https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1687482108925669376).\n\nHowever, I suspect that they may additionally be specifically attempting to disrupt the BSF's sealift capacity because it is becoming proportionally more important as the Ukrainians successfully disrupt Russian ground lines of communication into southern Ukraine by targeting critical rail logistics nodes (typically bridges and depots), most especially the Kerch Bridge. [Previous attacks on Alligator and Ropucha class landing ships occurred in Berdyansk in March of 2022](https://news.usni.org/2022/03/25/satellite-images-confirm-russian-navy-landing-ship-was-sunk-at-berdyansk), where the ships were offloading military cargo. Two Ropucha class LSTs were disabled or sunk during the Berdyansk attack, with the unsunk ship remaining out of service due to insufficient parts available for repairs, which likely means this third loss will also be effectively permanent. (Interesting aside, [there are rumors that they are unable to repair the ships because the Poles supplied the Russians with intentionally defective parts for the ships back in 2019](https://mash-ru.translate.goog/news/156607?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true), which would be hilarious if true but I would consider those claims non-credible or at least largely unconfirmed at this point.)\n\nI believe those losses were sufficient to dissuade the Russians from regularly using the landing ships for resupply on the north Azov coast, because they have been mostly sitting in port in Sevastopol or Novorossiya ever since, until the recent (second) Kerch Bridge attack when landing ships started working as ferries for civilian and military traffic across the Kerch Strait. The Russians only had something like ten or so landing ships in the Black Sea at the beginning of the conflict, so the loss of four of those ships represents a substantial reduction in sealift capacity. Particularly now that they know the Ropucha-class ships at least are effectively not repairable. If they can't defend the Kerch Bridge, sealift is the only reasonable way they can hope to supply heavy artillery ammunition in quantity to Crimea. While airlift is also theoretically possible because southern Crimea remains well out of range of Ukrainian AA capabilities, it is too expensive and limited in capacity to reasonably supply artillery ammo at the rates the Russians have been consuming it. \n\nIn short, I think we are witnessing the Ukrainians attempt their strategy from the Kherson counteroffensive. i.e., disrupting Russian logistics to the point that they are forced to retreat even in the absence of successful Ukrainian breaching assaults on Russian fortified positions. Now, however, instead of just targeting the Dnipro crossings, the Ukrainian strategy requires targeting a broader set of logistics nodes, including sealift-capable ships. That makes the strategy harder to execute, but also possibly harder to defend against because the specific targets are harder to predict.",

But it is one of the few legal sealift targets the Ukrainians can attack at the moment, and moving 2000 tons of cargo 20 times per day across the Kerch Strait adds up to a substantial amount in the context of the current conflict. Certainly enough to justify expending a jet ski and 200kg of explosives.\n\n> If Sevastopol's Port is so vulnerable to Storm Shadows, why not attack military ships right now.\n\nBecause I am considering what will happen one or two steps ahead of the present moment. If the Ukrainians choke off Russian ground supplies, sealift is the natural fallback option. So the Ukrainians are setting themselves up to degrade those Russian capabilities starting right now, rather than waiting until the Russians actually start having to keep Crimea supplied entirely by sea. Demonstrating that capacity now also greatly increases the political costs of the military seizing civilian vessels, because the owners will view them as being at greater risk of total loss. The Ukrainians have also been striking deeper and deeper into Crimea recently, including blowing a large S-300/400 ammo dump the other day. The more they degrade Russian AD on the peninsula, the closer they will be able to get to Sevastopol. They are undoubtedly planning courses of action based around that contingency, and likely also the contingency where they are unable to push that far.\n\nBut in the event things go according to plan for the Ukrainians, the LSTs represent a relatively useful option for the Russians to stretch out their defense as long as they possibly can, either on the northern Azov coast after a Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia or in Crimea itself. Because that's all the Russians are doing. Buying time until the mud season, hoping to keep as much as they can before either the parties are forced to negotiate or the west gets bored and stops supplying Ukraine. Moving a few thousand tons of cargo to a critical supply point along any of the coastal regions at this point represents an important capability within that paradigm, because it can buy the Russians outsized amounts of time during a delaying action if used efficiently.",

Certainly enough to justify expending a jet ski and 200kg of explosives.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Sevastopol&#39;s Port is so vulnerable to Storm Shadows, why not attack military ships right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because I am considering what will happen one or two steps ahead of the present moment. If the Ukrainians choke off Russian ground supplies, sealift is the natural fallback option. So the Ukrainians are setting themselves up to degrade those Russian capabilities starting right now, rather than waiting until the Russians actually start having to keep Crimea supplied entirely by sea. Demonstrating that capacity now also greatly increases the political costs of the military seizing civilian vessels, because the owners will view them as being at greater risk of total loss. The Ukrainians have also been striking deeper and deeper into Crimea recently, including blowing a large S-300/400 ammo dump the other day. The more they degrade Russian AD on the peninsula, the closer they will be able to get to Sevastopol. They are undoubtedly planning courses of action based around that contingency, and likely also the contingency where they are unable to push that far.</p>\n\n<p>But in the event things go according to plan for the Ukrainians, the LSTs represent a relatively useful option for the Russians to stretch out their defense as long as they possibly can, either on the northern Azov coast after a Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia or in Crimea itself. Because that&#39;s all the Russians are doing. Buying time until the mud season, hoping to keep as much as they can before either the parties are forced to negotiate or the west gets bored and stops supplying Ukraine. Moving a few thousand tons of cargo to a critical supply point along any of the coastal regions at this point represents an important capability within that paradigm, because it can buy the Russians outsized amounts of time during a delaying action if used efficiently.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "> Do boats differ significantly in their survivability based on armour ratings?\n\nThe USN sorts its warships into one of three levels of survivability, however other than their existence not much is out in the public sphere on them.  Standards related to equipment hardening, such as [MIL-S-901](https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/mil-s-901-everything-you-need-to-know), give rise to the suggestion that survivability is more based on how well systems themselves handle damage rather than existence of any armor to protect them, but even the most recent copies of these aren't exactly floating around.\n\nAs with other American MIL-STDs, most NATO and American-allied countries (ex. Japan) tend to just follow the US's lead, though where and how they differ likewise isn't well-known, or at least not commonly discussed. \n\n> Is there new and exciting technology in this area?\n\nThe most important form of survivability by far is avoiding hits in the first place.  But excluding that, some effort is known to have been invested into improving ship survivability during the 1990s and 2000s, a lot of which can be found on the *Zumwalt*-class and which is at least partially responsible for their immense weight.  Two features worth highlighting in particular are the MK57 VLS and Total Ship Computing Environment.\n\nThe MK57 is designed with heavily-reinforced inboard and side walls intended to contain the blast of any hit, and channel as much of it back outwards as possible in order to minimize damage.  When the VLS is empty, that already reduces splinter and blast damage from a hit, but when the VLS is loaded, the stored missiles detonating turns the system into a form of reactive armor.  Information on how well this works in reality isn't really easy to come by though, and as part of the return to peer conflict thinking, the USN is back to not getting hit as their primary method of defense.\n\nTSCE's primary purpose was to reduce manpower requirements, but linking of all the ship's computers and displays into a single network means it's supposedly possible to transfer functionality from damaged areas to undamaged ones.  That means automated systems in an area affected by a casualty can still run and be operated, provided they aren't physically destroyed.  The ability to move displays and functions to other screens as necessary isn't new or unique to the *Zumwalt*s - [the *Virginia*-class is known to have such a capability for its bridge screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0StWrXoN8nI) - but the scale of TSCE and resulting level of redundancy sets it apart.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Do boats differ significantly in their survivability based on armour ratings?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The USN sorts its warships into one of three levels of survivability, however other than their existence not much is out in the public sphere on them.  Standards related to equipment hardening, such as <a href=\"https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/mil-s-901-everything-you-need-to-know\">MIL-S-901</a>, give rise to the suggestion that survivability is more based on how well systems themselves handle damage rather than existence of any armor to protect them, but even the most recent copies of these aren&#39;t exactly floating around.</p>\n\n<p>As with other American MIL-STDs, most NATO and American-allied countries (ex. Japan) tend to just follow the US&#39;s lead, though where and how they differ likewise isn&#39;t well-known, or at least not commonly discussed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there new and exciting technology in this area?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most important form of survivability by far is avoiding hits in the first place.  But excluding that, some effort is known to have been invested into improving ship survivability during the 1990s and 2000s, a lot of which can be found on the <em>Zumwalt</em>-class and which is at least partially responsible for their immense weight.

Very curious to see what the junta does honestly. Ostensibly they seem to have the support of Mali and Burkina Faso (and maybe Wagner, that whole bit is very unclear). But neither of those two countries are in a particularly great place to lend significant amounts of aid to Niger without putting their so-far-tenuous survival at risk. It's not as if ECOWAS, for all their soft response to those coups, wouldn't enjoy the chance to kick them around a bit too.   \n\n\nIMO there are three critical factors for whether or not the junta makes a big fight of this that we are just really not aware of. The first is popular support for the junta within Niger. It's not really been quantified and though we've seen demonstrations in the capital in favor of the junta and Russia, those have numbered in the thousands while Niger's population is some 25 million. If there is broad popular support for the coup, then the junta will probably fight. It's a lot easier to do so when you can count on your country to actually support you.   \n\n\nThe second is whether or not you have the true loyalty of the military. The Presidential Guard started the coup initially and are a small, elite subset of the overall military forces. Other senior commanders in the military ultimately backed their efforts, but not all. The rest of the military essentially acceded to the junta control to avoid a civil war and ensure that the captured president was not murdered. Indeed, in the early days of this incident, there were small mutinies among troops in favor of the President that then tapered off. So can the junta, despite containing high ranking officers, count on the military to fight? Can they also count on Nigerien paramilitary forces, such as the Gendarmarie and the National Guard? I'd have to go look at the specific list of junta leaders for the best answer, but I think any loyalty from the military is largely tentative at best. If superior Nigerian air power starts ramping up, for example, and these dudes are getting zapped from above, I don't know that the junta has had the time or the influence to establish enough legitimacy that they just won't break and run. This could be compounded as an issue if Nigeria/ECOWAS really makes it clear that their specific intent is to reinstall Bazoum and then leave. If Nigerien independence is not at stake, merely the lives and livelihoods of the junta, then there is a lot less motivation to fight.  \n\n\nThe third factor is Wagner/outside support. There are rumors swirling all over the place that Wagner was present when the Nigerien junta met with leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso and that the combined dictators requested aid and even Wagner mercenaries for defense. Hell, there was even a rumor floating around yesterday that Iran had sent a representative of the Quds Force down to Niger to talk assistance. In an inflow of experienced foreign fighters and advanced weaponry is obviously going to make it harder for Nigeria to succeed in ousting the junta. But despite Prigozhin's big talk and shady Russian involvement in this whole thing, I don't think there's been any solid evidence that the junta actually has Wagner in their corner, much less Wagner boots on the ground.  \n\n\nAll in all, I'll just expand on a previous estimate I made in another post where I said that, on a scale of very unlikely to very likely, a Nigerian intervention was somewhat likely. I place the likelihood of Nigerien junta making a fight of it at somewhat likely. There is a decent chance they may cave at this announcement and just negotiate. After all, a life in relative comfort exiled in Mali or Burkina Faso with the chance to maybe clap back at a later date is probably preferable to death. But if they can at least get the capital population onside for a fight, I think they will make ECOWAS fight and hope that Russia comes to the rescue. So somewhat likely it is.",

The Russians said that one tank against eight repelled the attack, created a loud PR.  \nIn fact, this is a video of a difficult and bloody victory of Ukrainian troops, which shows how, despite errors in planning and implementation, the high heroism and skill of Ukrainian soldiers turned the tide of battle.  \nAccording to the information I gathered, the video shows an attack on the first day of the Ukrainian offensive on the southern front.  \nOn June 4, units of the 23rd mechanized brigade attacked Russian positions near the village of Novodarivka in the Zaporizhzhia region.  \nTwo tanks were the first in the column in the video, followed by six armored vehicles, which did not have any anti-tank weapons. That is, in fact, only two advanced tanks had the opportunity to engage in battle with a Russian tank. The Russian tank did not destroy all our equipment - most of the equipment was blown up by anti-tank mines. Unfortunately, the enemy fired well and was able to retreat. But then the video ends at the most interesting part - what are the results?  \nAnd then it was not so interesting to show the Russians. The crews and infantrymen of the 23rd brigade did not run away, but secured themselves in a position near the broken equipment and after some time went forward. That is, the Russian tank failed to repulse the attack.  \nAnd this was not the only direction of the attack on Novodarivka - there was also an attack on another flank. The 110th Territorial Defense Brigade also entered the battle for the village.  \nRussian infantry defended the village under the cover of minefields and with the support of three T-90A tanks, according to the testimony of our fighters. One of these Russian tanks was destroyed on the outskirts of Novodarivka by a grenade launcher of the 110th TRO brigade, the wreckage of this tank is now being photographed by all journalists. After this defeat, two other tanks escaped, including the crew that attacked our column.  \nAfter the Russian tanks abandoned their infantry in the village, the soldiers of the 23rd and 110th brigades defeated the Russians in a contact battle, the escape began, and already on the evening of June 4, Novodarivka was freed from the occupiers.  \nIn other words, the Russian video is one of the unsuccessful tragic episodes of a generally successful operation for us.  \nAnd now for my personal take on the mistakes and takeaways that I believe affected the outcome of this episode on video:  \n1. Unfortunately, the command of the corps, which issued the order for the use of the 23rd brigade, did not take into account that it was a newly created brigade that had not been tested for coordination and use in real combat conditions. Planning must correspond to the actual capabilities of the troops.  \n2. There was insufficient interaction with the 110th Zaporizhzhya TRO brigade, which had been operating in the area for a long time, had a good command of the situation, and could inform about the location of minefields and the defense system. After all, the 110th brigade had already entered Novodarivka before. The offensive must be planned, relying on those who have a better command of the tactical situation.  \n3. It is obvious from the movement of the column of armored vehicles that their actions were not corrected from the drone, and our tankers did not receive a timely notification and target designation regarding the approach of a Russian tank, the presence of which was known, it was possible to detect it and direct our tanks to it. But, unfortunately, we suffered unjustified losses due to the lack of control of the battle. War experience shows that armored vehicle crews during defensive or offensive actions must have constant information about the enemy and be guided by drones. The task of identifying targets during a maneuver battle cannot be transferred exclusively to the crew of combat vehicles. It is not the number of tanks in a convoy, but the number of drones, the quality of surveillance and the speed of response to changes in the situation that create an advantage in modern combat.  \nA Russian video shows how difficult the liberation of Novodarivka was. And mistakes during this operation should not be forgotten, but conclusions should be drawn so as not to be repeated.  \nAnd each of the Ukrainian heroes who liberated the village and contributed to the victory deserve the highest honors of the state and society.  \nIf any of the participants in those battles would like to clarify the circumstances and add details, please write to the messenger.\"",

He is right-center and has very set opinion what needs fixing in UA, how to  fix it, etc.\n\nHe is critical of the UA governent - Russia has setup war economy, but UA is still fully dependant on the west. He advocates to push very hard in order to get 30% of the army stuff domestically. By spring.\n\nGetting to '91 borders is impossible. The best UA can do now, with this level of preparedness, is to reach azov.\n\nHe is very worried the west wants to save Putkin and that they will squeeze UA to negotiate.

Just was a fun way to get started but the platform is much worse now.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a much easier language to be fair. I half passed learning Chinese for a couple months before travelling there and could barely hold a basic conversation. Listening into a family talking I&#39;d catch a word but not be sure which tone was used and while trying to use context cues to determine which it was likely to be, I&#39;ve already heard a half dozen more words I had the same problem with. Mentally taxing to say the least.</p>\n</div>",

Any forces they expend for Niger will take them away from that. Especially looking at all the factors.\n\nIf there's a military intervention in Niger, it will be led by Nigeria and supported by the US/France. In comparing Algeria to Nigeria, the former is 44 million people versus the latter's 230 million, so it's much smaller. Military wise, focusing on land troops only, Algeria has 110k active versus Nigeria's 160k. So the land forces are also smaller. Airpower would also be a non-issue with US and French support. \n\nAnother issue is that Morocco is an ally of the US. We supply equipment - including Abrams tanks - and some of their T-72s were the ones purchased to be upgraded by the Czechs for Ukraine. So Algeria stepping into Niger - if the US is providing air support - would be hazardous because it might make Morocco feel bold enough to make a move with US air support already running operations nearby.\n\nThe last issue is that Niger's military is small and weak. There's only something like 25k total forces including their Gendermie and National Guard (which is unknown if they support the coup/would resist an invasion). Their land forces are only roughly 5k. Any coalition invasion force would likely push that aside quickly, especially with 2,500ish US and French troops in Niger already. What that means is that Algeria would essentially have to do most of the fighting for them against any coalition force.

The big names, Rommel, Guderian, Patton, Eisenhower, etc. had all had decades of pre-war experience most dating back to WWI. Creighton Abrams was someone who came close, except he went to Westpoint and graduated in 1936, served five years in the peacetime Army, and then it took him three years to reach Colonel and command of an armored Combat Command. William DePuy, another future Army leader, graduated just months before Pearl in 1941 from ROTC, and only reached the rank of Major and command of a battalion in 1944, and did not rise above battalion command (despite being both well liked and relatively successful in that role) until after the war. \n\nIt would be very unusual to expect soldiers, even those who have had success, who first joined up in 2022 to have risen very high. Instead, its likely that at the operational echelon and above, most of the officers there have had significant pre-war experience and were trained in Soviet-style thinking. There may be a few here and there with some western training experience layered on top, but keep in mind that a battalion even is more than its commanding officer. There is a whole staff, a whole system of organization and planning, which is necessary to conduct day to day operations and which is heavily tied to organizational culture and prewar training/processes. Moreover the typical promotion route seems to be, for the US Army, tactical command ->Battalion/Regimental staff position ->operational command. Not sure if its the same for Ukraine/USSR, but I would guess so. All this insulates the operational command of units from the tactical experience. Its hard to filter that upwards, if thats even something thats desirable. An operational commander has a very different set of problems typically than their tactical counterpart. Which is why there is such a strong dividing line, created by training and outlook. But this then begs the question, if were looking at older, more experienced, prewar officers in these operational positions, is a 4 or 6 week NATO led training course *really* going to replace a half decade or more of experience in the old army and along the old Donbas front? Probably not. So either you can give up trying to make these guys fight like NATO officers and play to their strengths (centrally planned setpiece battle!) or you treat the Ukrainian Army like Stalin treated the Red Army. Succeed or leave, and were willing to accept any heartburn associated with pulling an Lt. up to do a Col.'s job.",

And a big reason we focused on COMBLOC equipment transfers in 2022 was we knew they could use them ASAP versus not having a clue with western equipment.

More so, as this offensive also showed, the big benefits of western equipment isn't mission success, its survivability.\n\nSecond, the Ukrainians already had GMLRS from the start of the war, they had Vilkha-M and were using it similarly to the HIMARS/M31 GMLRS but ran out of their limited supply.\n\nSame goes with DPICM, they had their own cluster munitions too and have been using them throughout this war. And they didn't want western DPICM to gain a new capability with cluster munitions, they wanted them because that would unlock hundreds of thousands to millions of existing munitions sitting in warehouses that could be immediately given to Ukraine so they could massively increase their fire rates because their goal is to outshoot Russia (not surprising they adopted the Soviet approach to defeat Russia).\n\nAs for F16s, they definitely aren't ready for them. One, they'd easily be the most expensive commitment, and nobody wants to give Ukraine an entirely new air force of F16s for free. So if Ukraine could pay for them, that would probably help. Because its not just the aircraft and the weaponry, its the warehouses full of spare parts, its the direct contractor support from General Dynamics, etc. A very cynical part of me believes the Ukrainians are pushing so hard for F16s right now because they think they might be able to get them for free now versus paying down the road. \n\nEven if the decision was made in April 2022 to give them F16s (that is way too early, but let's go with it), they'd not even be ready by this point. It takes a very long time just to train the aircrew to get the most basic level of combat pilot, with the most basic knowledge of almost limited skill, as [this article attests](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/this-is-how-long-it-would-really-take-ukraines-pilots-to-convert-to-f-16s). But they don't need just wingman level abilities, they need to run flights of them and do all sorts of different missions, especially to get the \"air superiority\" affects that so many people think they'd bring to the table. Plus ground crews, who wont actually learn entirely new systems in 3-5 weeks because they're motivated and Ukrainian, aka Ubermensch super warriors. A basic grunt mechanic might only take months. A crew chief, like a senior NCO or warrant officer, are supposed to be a subject matter expert and will take years to create. And to run a large fleet of F16s requires many hundreds of those, more than pilots. \n\nLastly, nobody still figured out the runway issue. \n\nF16s can't do dispersed airfield operations, its engine intake is highly susceptible to Foreign Object Debris (FOD), and they skimped on landing gear using aluminum and titanium to save weight for better thrust to weight ration. \n\nExisting Ukraine MiGs and SU aircraft have reinforced landing gear and grills or other means of dealing with FOD threat. The F16 does not, its designed for pristine airfields. The Ukrainian Air Force has been performing dispersed airfield operations the entirety of the war, its the only reason they survived.
