The Russians (98th VDV Division; particularly its 331st Airborne Regiment) have managed to pass the Donets-Donbas Canal and establish a foothold in the western bank, capturing the trenches along the canal in that area and some houses in Zhovtnevyi District, particularly in the area just south of the Bakhmut - Chasiv Yar railway. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6479\n\nRecall that in the canal the water reaches up to the knee - there is no problem in passing it, but it\u2019s not possible to carry heavy equipment to the other bank as of now. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the intensity of fighting remains high, the importance of Chasiv Yar has decreased compared to, for example, the Pokrovsk sector. Let's also recall the transfer of the 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps as well as the 11th VDV Brigade from this sector to Kursk. Also, according to Russian sources, subunits of the 98th VDV Division were recently replenished with men from the 104th VDV Division. \n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3315\n\nChasiv Yar is defended primarily by the 24th Mech Brigade; the northern flank (Kalynivka area) is covered by the 56th Motorized Brigade, recently reinforced by the arrival of the 23rd Mech Brigade. The southern flank (Ivanivske area) is covered by the 5th Assault Brigade, along with its \"dowries\u201d - primarily territorial defense battalions (particularly from the 112th TDF Brigade).\n\nAt the same time, the Russians are trying to expand as much control as possible on the flanks of Chasiv Yar, on the eastern bank of the canal. To the north, units of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps (particularly its \"Sever-V\" and \"St. George\" Assault and Recon Brigades) have managed to approach Hryhorivka, as well as to advance about 2,5 km to the west of Zaliznyanske, along some forest belts, in the defense area of the 30th Mech Brigade.\n\nTo the south, there is progress in near Klishchiivka. It\u2019s likely that the Ukrainians have lost control over Hill 215 and the large trenches system around it. The 93rd Mech Brigade along with its \"dowries\u201d is the main Ukrainian force in this area (which have been significantly weakened recently with the withdrawal of the 22nd Mech Brigade and of the elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade which were deployed here), and faces attacks by the 4th Motorized Brigade of the 3rd CAA (from the north, supported by \"Akhmat\" detachments) and by the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps (from the east). The Russians are trying to approach Hill 227 (south-west of Hill 215) and to clear the Ukrainian forward positions in the forested area west of Klishchiivka.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6374\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6378\n\nAt the same time, further south, the 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps and the 7th Military Base of the 49th CAA are advancing north of Andriivka. The village is likely a grey area. The area of Hill 220, west of Andriivka, remains in Ukrainian hands. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6522\n\nHow long the Ukrainian bridgehead in the eastern bank of the canal will be able to hold, is something that it\u2019s more than legitimate to begin wondering.\n\nRussians (probably from the 177th Separate Naval Infantry Regiment) were seen in a Ukrainian trench just west of the Donets-Donbas Canal, between Kurdyumivka and Ozarianivka, in the defense area of the 28th Mech Brigade (which ranges from Kurdyumivka to Druzhba).\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6518\n\nToretsk Sector. This sector is the main effort of the 51st CAA, i.e. the former 1st Corps. After completely occupying the Ukrainian bridgehead in the eastern bank of the canal in the area to the north-west of Mayorsk, the Russians have recorded further advances inside Druzhba, reaching the western part of the village - the north-western part of which remains Ukrainian. To the south of the Kostiantynivka-Horlivka railway, the Russians are working to finish conquering the built-up area of Pivnichne, after having occupied the terrikon west of the town.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6573\n\nThe Russians have already entered Toretsk itself (from two sides). From the east, they have captured the vast majority of the high rises district and the Toretsk Central City Hospital - a little further south, they are approaching the Nova Poshta No. 1 office and the Penal Colony No. 2. There are also Russian advances in the area of the dachas, east of the penal colony.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6556\n\nThe 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA is active in this area, along with rifle regiments of the same army, such as the 101st and 109th. On the Ukrainian side, there are the 32nd and 100th Mech Brigades (the latter arrived in July after two months of rest to recover combat capabilities - this was the brigade that replaced the 115th Mech Brigade after the Ocheretyne breakthrough and was engaged in bloody battles), along with the bulk of the \"Lyut\" Brigade of the National Police, as well as with the 138th Special Purpose Center of the Military Police. The 95th Air Assault Brigade was active here, but the bulk moved to Kursk, being replaced by the new 150th Mech Brigade. \n\nHere the Russian tactic is a considerable use of KABs along with the assault by small groups of stormtroopers, who build up, group after group, in the basement of buildings until they have accumulated enough strength to attack another given Ukrainian position, to which they have meanwhile moved considerably closer.\n\nThe Russians occupied the terrikon west of Zalizne, as well as the electric substation south-west of the town. After occupying the small psychiatric and tuberculosis hospitals, they entered the south-eastern part of Toretsk, seizing the Secondary School No. 2. The 1st Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA is active in this area. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6499\n\nWest of Nelipivka, in the area of the ponds, there are still Ukrainian positions. This village should be almost entirely in Ukrainian hands. The situation in Niu-York (particularly in areas such as the Phenol Plant and the Special School No. 38) is unclear \u2013 the town is indeed overwhelmingly in Russian hands, although there remains an Ukrainian presence in some areas in the northern part.\n\nThe 53rd Mech Brigade, fighting in Niu-York (where it arrived in July after several months in Sumy Oblast to recover combat capabilities), is doing a good job despite considerable difficulties, along with the 425th \"Skala\" Separate Assault Battalion and several other units - such as the 72nd and 212th Battalions of the 101st TDF Brigade, at least one battalion of the 105th TDF Brigade, and so on. There should also be a battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade and possibly a rifle battalion of the 66th Mech Brigade in the area. The 41st Mech Brigade as far as I know should have been taken out to recover combat capabilities, along with the elements of the 241st TDF Brigade that were attached to it. \n\nAs for the Russians, the 9th Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA along with the 111th Rifle Regiment, subordinate to it, is active in Niu-York. The Russians are also working to expand westwards, along several forest belts, towards Oleksandropil and Panteleimonivka, thus trying to outflank Ukrainian positions, held mainly by the 109th TDF Brigade, which have been preventing the Russians from moving northwards (from the Novobakhmutivka area) for months. The 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA is likely active in this area. Second part below.",

            "body": "Pokrovsk sector. It\u2019s needless to reiterate how critical the situation is. The main problem, at the tactical-operational level, was the breakthrough at Prohres and the seizure of the source of the Vovcha that occurred shortly thereafter. This was further aggravated by the loss of Zhelanne and Serhiivka, in front of which there were important strongpoints. Although the Ukrainians are still making mistakes, the current situation is a consequence of these losses. \n\nWe had seen several times in recent months the meaning of the rivers in this sector. The Russian advance west of the Vovcha River has completely undermined the capable Ukrainian resistance (by the 47th Mech Brigade and especially by the 68th Jager Brigade) during the summer in the Novoselivka Persha area, which had allowed to buy time, but was basically useless in light of the events that occurred. The important fortifications that the Ukrainians had along the course of the Vovcha and which were to form the main defense line were taken from behind: the western bank of the river was quickly captured by the Russians, being poorly defensible against attacks from the north. With the result that the Russians now occupied Karlivka and its reservoir (which was to act as a natural barrier against advances from the east) from the north... It's really hard to underestimate that. Now there are no more potential defensive lines so blessed by morphology and waterways, with the Russians much closer to Pokrovsk and having reached the gates of Selydove. \n\nLet's do a recap of the tactical situation, from north to south. Firstly, in the northern flank of the sector (from Vozdvyzhenka to the H20 Highway), held by the 110th Mech Brigade (to which the 111th TDF Brigade and other territorial defense units are subordinate), there have been no Russian advances, thanks also to the presence of widespread fortifications. From Vozdvyzhenka to Lozuvatske, the Ukrainians are successfully holding positions along the forest belt between the two villages. \n\nFrom the source of the Kazennyi Torets in Lozuvatske, the Russians (41st CAA operates here) were able to occupy the southern bank of the river as far as Novotoretske, reaching the pond formed by the confluence of the Kazennyi Torets with the Zhuravka River, having occupied Ivanivka a couple of weeks ago (the village was captured by the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA). There is no evidence to the Russian rumors that the latters were able to cross the Kazennyi Torets north of Novotoretske. This area is defended by the 14th \"Chervona Kalyna\" Brigade of the National Guard, together with the 35th \"Sumy\" Regiment of the NG. \n\nHrodivka is being attacked by the Russians, who control the eastern part of the village. They have also approached the built-up area from the south, capturing the forest belts in that area. Ukrainian resistance is very strong. The village primarily is defended by the 151st Mech Brigade. According to Russian sources, the village was captured yesterday by the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA, but there is no evidence in favor of this. In any case, there are several strong points further west along the road to Myrnohrad.\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/27032\n\nJust to the south, the 15th and 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd CAA are active; the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA is active in the direction of Selydove, with all its three motorized regiments in action (433rd, 506th, 589th). There are also numerous regiments of the Territorial Forces attached to Russian units. All the units of the Central Military District (except of course the 25th CAA, which is in the Lyman sector under the GoF \"West\") are attacking in this area, including the 90th Tank Division \u2013 the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA is involved too. The 1st Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA, before it was moved to the Toretsk sector, also fought along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway; its stormtroopers were the first Russians to enter Prohres, back in July. In the Pokrovsk sector there are also the 3rd and 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigades, as well as the brigade tactical group of the 201st Military Base.\n\nAfter occupying Zhuravka (taken by the 589th Motorized Regiment), the Russians moved against Krasnyi Yar and Krutyi Yar. The situation there is not entirely clear - they should, however, remain in Ukrainian hands - at least the former village. From here the Russians aim to approach Myrnohrad (which, remember, is a city of almost 50 thousand people before the war). In this area, in mid-August, the 71st Jager Brigade returned in action.\n\nJust south of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway, the Russians completely occupied Novohrodivka. In this town there were serious coordination problems between the various Ukrainian units and even more serious command and control problems on the part of OTG \"Donetsk\u201d, which contributed to the rapid Russian advance. Here the Russians also occupied the northern part of the town, including the Coal Mine located there. \n\nThe 47th Mech Brigade with its numerous \"dowries\" is active in the area, along with the 117th Mech Brigade (to which the 28th Rifle Battalion, which lost its commander earlier this month, is subordinate) and the 2nd \"Galician\" Brigade of the NG. The 25th Airborne Brigade has recently arrived in the area from Karlivka. The 31st Mech Brigade, at least the bulk of it, has been brought out for restoration. Elements of it may be in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, according to what I found in social media.\n\nFurther south, the Russians are trying to occupy Marynivka. They have also occupied a section of the M04 (E50) Highway, including several strongholds in the area. They have also seized Mykhailivka, a village that is in fact an eastern suburb of Selydove (though it\u2019s part of the Novohrodivka hromada), occupying the local Coal Mine. From here the Russians are trying to enter Selydove, managing to occupy some houses in the eastern end of the town. However, Ukrainian resistance is very strong and no relevant Russian successes are recorded in the town. The 15th \"Kara-Dag\" Brigade of the NG is active in this area.\n\nLooking south-east, the Russians have passed the M04 and occupied Memryk. The 90th Tank Division is active in this area. The village has been occupied by its 228th Motorized Regiment. Subunits of its 6th, 80th and 239th Tank Regiments are active in the area, and also providing armored support to other units in the sector. Now the Russians are pushing further south, approaching Halytsynivka and Lisivka. In this area, Ukrainian control over Ukrainsk will be crucial. Getting closer to the Vovcha, the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA active. It, together with the 90th Tank Division, was brought into the western bank of the Vovcha after the capture of Novoselivka Persha - once it was clear that the Ukrainians would abandon their positions in the eastern bank. \n\nThe 114th Motorized Brigade, moving down the course of the Vovcha, reached the part of Karlivka on the western bank of the Vovcha, which they occupied; while the Ukrainians left the part of the village on the eastern bank (which had held out for months against the Russian attacks from the east), which was occupied by the \"Somalia\" Assault Battalion (subordinate to the 9th Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA) and by the 112th Rifle Regiment of the 51st CAA \u2013 which have now therefore met with the soldiers of the 114th Brigade coming southwards from the other side of the Vovcha.

Third part below.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Pokrovsk sector. It\u2019s needless to reiterate how critical the situation is. The main problem, at the tactical-operational level, was the breakthrough at Prohres and the seizure of the source of the Vovcha that occurred shortly thereafter. This was further aggravated by the loss of Zhelanne and Serhiivka, in front of which there were important strongpoints. Although the Ukrainians are still making mistakes, the current situation is a consequence of these losses. </p>\n\n<p>We had seen several times in recent months the meaning of the rivers in this sector. The Russian advance west of the Vovcha River has completely undermined the capable Ukrainian resistance (by the 47th Mech Brigade and especially by the 68th Jager Brigade) during the summer in the Novoselivka Persha area, which had allowed to buy time, but was basically useless in light of the events that occurred. The important fortifications that the Ukrainians had along the course of the Vovcha and which were to form the main defense line were taken from behind: the western bank of the river was quickly captured by the Russians, being poorly defensible against attacks from the north. With the result that the Russians now occupied Karlivka and its reservoir (which was to act as a natural barrier against advances from the east) from the north... It&#39;s really hard to underestimate that. Now there are no more potential defensive lines so blessed by morphology and waterways, with the Russians much closer to Pokrovsk and having reached the gates of Selydove. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s do a recap of the tactical situation, from north to south. Firstly, in the northern flank of the sector (from Vozdvyzhenka to the H20 Highway), held by the 110th Mech Brigade (to which the 111th TDF Brigade and other territorial defense units are subordinate), there have been no Russian advances, thanks also to the presence of widespread fortifications. From Vozdvyzhenka to Lozuvatske, the Ukrainians are successfully holding positions along the forest belt between the two villages. </p>\n\n<p>From the source of the Kazennyi Torets in Lozuvatske, the Russians (41st CAA operates here) were able to occupy the southern bank of the river as far as Novotoretske, reaching the pond formed by the confluence of the Kazennyi Torets with the Zhuravka River, having occupied Ivanivka a couple of weeks ago (the village was captured by the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA). There is no evidence to the Russian rumors that the latters were able to cross the Kazennyi Torets north of Novotoretske. This area is defended by the 14th &quot;Chervona Kalyna&quot; Brigade of the National Guard, together with the 35th &quot;Sumy&quot; Regiment of the NG. </p>\n\n<p>Hrodivka is being attacked by the Russians, who control the eastern part of the village. They have also approached the built-up area from the south, capturing the forest belts in that area. Ukrainian resistance is very strong. The village primarily is defended by the 151st Mech Brigade. According to Russian sources, the village was captured yesterday by the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA, but there is no evidence in favor of this. In any case, there are several strong points further west along the road to Myrnohrad.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/motopatriot/27032</p>\n\n<p>Just to the south, the 15th and 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd CAA are active; the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA is active in the direction of Selydove, with all its three motorized regiments in action (433rd, 506th, 589th). There are also numerous regiments of the Territorial Forces attached to Russian units. All the units of the Central Military District (except of course the 25th CAA, which is in the Lyman sector under the GoF &quot;West&quot;) are attacking in this area, including the 90th Tank Division \u2013 the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA is involved too. The 1st Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA, before it was moved to the Toretsk sector, also fought along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway; its stormtroopers were the first Russians to enter Prohres, back in July. In the Pokrovsk sector there are also the 3rd and 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigades, as well as the brigade tactical group of the 201st Military Base.</p>\n\n<p>After occupying Zhuravka (taken by the 589th Motorized Regiment), the Russians moved against Krasnyi Yar and Krutyi Yar. The situation there is not entirely clear - they should, however, remain in Ukrainian hands - at least the former village. From here the Russians aim to approach Myrnohrad (which, remember, is a city of almost 50 thousand people before the war). In this area, in mid-August, the 71st Jager Brigade returned in action.</p>\n\n<p>Just south of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway, the Russians completely occupied Novohrodivka. In this town there were serious coordination problems between the various Ukrainian units and even more serious command and control problems on the part of OTG &quot;Donetsk\u201d, which contributed to the rapid Russian advance. Here the Russians also occupied the northern part of the town, including the Coal Mine located there. </p>\n\n<p>The 47th Mech Brigade with its numerous &quot;dowries&quot; is active in the area, along with the 117th Mech Brigade (to which the 28th Rifle Battalion, which lost its commander earlier this month, is subordinate) and the 2nd &quot;Galician&quot; Brigade of the NG. The 25th Airborne Brigade has recently arrived in the area from Karlivka. The 31st Mech Brigade, at least the bulk of it, has been brought out for restoration. Elements of it may be in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, according to what I found in social media.</p>\n\n<p>Further south, the Russians are trying to occupy Marynivka. They have also occupied a section of the M04 (E50) Highway, including several strongholds in the area. They have also seized Mykhailivka, a village that is in fact an eastern suburb of Selydove (though it\u2019s part of the Novohrodivka hromada), occupying the local Coal Mine. From here the Russians are trying to enter Selydove, managing to occupy some houses in the eastern end of the town. However, Ukrainian resistance is very strong and no relevant Russian successes are recorded in the town. The 15th &quot;Kara-Dag&quot; Brigade of the NG is active in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Looking south-east, the Russians have passed the M04 and occupied Memryk. The 90th Tank Division is active in this area. The village has been occupied by its 228th Motorized Regiment. Subunits of its 6th, 80th and 239th Tank Regiments are active in the area, and also providing armored support to other units in the sector. Now the Russians are pushing further south, approaching Halytsynivka and Lisivka. In this area, Ukrainian control over Ukrainsk will be crucial. Getting closer to the Vovcha, the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA active. It, together with the 90th Tank Division, was brought into the western bank of the Vovcha after the capture of Novoselivka Persha - once it was clear that the Ukrainians would abandon their positions in the eastern bank. </p>\n\n<p>The 114th Motorized Brigade, moving down the course of the Vovcha, reached the part of Karlivka on the western bank of the Vovcha, which they occupied; while the Ukrainians left the part of the village on the eastern bank (which had held out for months against the Russian attacks from the east), which was occupied by the &quot;Somalia&quot; Assault Battalion (subordinate to the 9th Motorized Brigade of the 51st CAA) and by the 112th Rifle Regiment of the 51st CAA \u2013 which have now therefore met with the soldiers of the 114th Brigade coming southwards from the other side of the Vovcha. The Russians also occupied several forest belts south of Karlivka. This morning the 114th Motorized Brigade captured the part of Halytsynivka north of the Vovcha River. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/6615</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians will probably try to hold as long as possible the rest of the village, which in any case lies on the eastern bank of the Vovcha (which in the vicinity of the village makes a sharp turn southwards), for the purpose of avoiding an abrupt withdrawal from the Nevelske area.

                "body": "What\u2019s often not possible is to reinforce positions while they are in serious danger of being lost, due to being the focus of Russian attacks and/or due to the exhaustion of the squad that is defending them. Because of infantry shortages, because of the loss of nearby positions leading to the risk of encirclement, because of the impossibility of counterattacks. But above all because of widespread incompetence by the command at every level: in the OSG \"Khortytsia\", in the OTG \" Donetsk\u201d, and in the commands of most brigades. \n\nIt must be said that there are also some Russian merits - as also pointed out by the Ukrainian observer Mashovets, the GoF \"Centre\" is by far the one with the best command & control. It is consistently able to maintain good interaction between units despite, as we saw above, many brigades/regiments being involved, even from different CAAs; as well as to identify Ukrainian weak points and take advantage of windows of opportunities that arise.\n\nMordvichev, the head of this GoF and of the Central Military District, is probably the best Russian general among those who are holding comparable posts. But it should also be said that the GoF \"Centre\" throughout this year has always been the \u201cfavorite son\u201d of the Russian Armed Forces. It has been and is constantly being allocated the greatest resources in terms of manpower and materials. Russian losses are enormous but there is a constant supply of men, a continuous one. Assault detachments are constantly being replenished and returning to attack. This, despite perhaps the Russians not having in a given time a multiple of the number of Ukrainian troops, grants the possibility of a very high turnover and gives the Ukrainians the impression that there are many more Russians. These continuous and generous supplies of men, but also of materials, allow units that have had gigantic losses for 10 months now to continue to fight and advance while maintaining good levels of readiness for offensive operations. This Russian channel reports that a very considerable portion of new recruits are assigned to units of the GoF \u201cCentre\u201d, leading to certain manpower shortages in other sectors.\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/4003\n\nThe Russians always attack in this sector, in every direction. They have approached the current line by attacking every single forest belt, and using that as a springboard to seize subsequent ones. Overall, that\u2019s how they managed to achieve such a fast advance along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway. The railroad is surrounded by wide forest belts on both sides. From a satellite view, it might not be so noticeable. I recommend viewing this [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Oh787Im.png). These forest belts were critical in allowing Russian infantry to advance in numbers large enough by the standards of this war (while relatively hidden from Ukrainian drones), build up and move on to the next attack. One cannot underestimate the role of the forest belts in facilitating Russian advances, which are occuring with limited use of armored vehicles (compared to what we see in the Kurakhove sector, for instance) and are very infantry-intensive. \n\nLet's bring data on this: according to reports from the OSG \"Khortytsia\", the day before yesterday there were 179 combat clashes, yesterday 183. This was from the Kharkiv sector to the Velyka Novosilka sector. On both days, 55 of these occurred in the Pokrovsk sector alone!\n\nhttps://t. me/Khortytsky_wind/998\n\nNot to mention Russian EW systems, fraticide problems for Ukrainian drones, the fact that the Russians often use new frequencies for FPV drones that make it very difficult, at least initially, for Ukrainian EW to adapt to them. In this sector KABs are of course a problem, but actually not that huge, at least compared to other sectors. The Russians just simply use a huge amount of artillery, mortars, TOS, AGS-17s etc. (even at the expense of other sectors) and manage to have enough shells to adequately cover any forest belt and the other Ukrainian positions.\n\nIn mid-July the Ukrainian tactical crisis peaked, and the brigades that had been fighting in this sector for months were exhausted. First and foremost, the 47th Mech Brigade - which fights thanks to many \" dowries\" assigned to it, the 31st Mech Brigade had lost combat capability, even the 68th Jager Brigade with its \u201cdowries\u201d (which good work has been flushed down the drain) was showing signs of months of attrition. The command therefore decided on the gradual arrival of a significant amount of reinforcements, despite the almost simultaneous start of offensive operations in Kursk. In the middle of the month, the 151st Mech Brigade, a new brigade, arrived - previously its battalions performed secondary tasks in different sectors, and was placed under the operational subordination of the 47th Mech Brigade. It should now operate independently - Syrsky recently visited the brigade's HQ in this sector. Like with other new brigades, there is the problem of the presence of \"suboptimal\" officers (who come from staffing roles, or are mobilized reserve officers retired like 25 years ago in a different branch, etc.), lack of a good core of NCOs, problems with training and physical fitness in a part of the infantrymen. But the soldiers of the brigade have been fighting valiantly, and often at great cost, in defense of their appointed positions.\n\nAt the end of July the 117th Mech Brigade (from Orikhiv), the 14th \"Chervona-Kalyna\" Brigade of the NG (from Orikhiv) and the 35th \"Sumy\" Regiment of the NG (from Velyka Pysarivka in Sumy Oblast, where it was covering the border) arrived. In early August the 15th \"Kara-Dag\" Brigade of the NG was transferred too - it has been mentioned in the daily bulletin of the Russian MoD for a couple of weeks and there are also several MIA notices of its servicemen. It\u2019s unclear whether it was accompanied by the 19th \"Mykolaiv\" Regiment of the NG, which was fighting in the Orikhiv sector attached to it. A considerable part of the Ukrainian grouping in the Orikhiv sector was transferred here. These are good brigades. The \"Tsunami\" Assault Regiment of the \"Lyut\" Brigade of the National Police was also recently transferred to the Pokrovsk sector from Vovchansk. The 71st Jager Brigade (at least the bulk of it), in the middle of this month, returned to the Pokrovsk sector from Vovchansk (one of its battalions had always remained in this sector by the way, to my knowledge). Additional territorial defense battalions have arrived to increase the infantry endowment of the brigades fighting here.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. According to my findings on Ukrainian social media, elements of the 58th Motorized Brigade should be arriving from the Velyka Novosilka sector. The 152nd Jager Brigade (or at least elements of it), as far as I have found from posts of relatives of its servicemen, has been assigned to the 58th Motorized Brigade and is being sent to Pokrovsk too. This new brigade was reformed from mechanized to jager in early August. According to what I have seen on posts of this brigade\u2019s servicemen, it appears to have received a batch of Kirpi MRAPs. Previously, this brigade used to cover, according to relatives, the second/third line in Sumy Oblast.\n\nAlso, the spokesman of the GoF \"Centre\" lately has started mentioning the 37th Marine Brigade and 44th Mech Brigade as being deployed in the area where the GoF has jurisdiction over. Most of the time it\u2019s reliable, but still I always wait to find actual evidence. There is none for the 44th Mech Brigade. However, I am beginning to find some initial confirmations for the 37th Marine Brigade, currently in Kherson Oblast. Its Recon UAV unit may be located in the Pokrovsk sector. I also found a photo showing servicemen from this brigade at the entrance to Donetsk Oblast, along the M04 Highway - leading from Pavlohrad to Pokrovsk. There are also some rumors about the arrival of elements of the 92nd Assault Brigade, but we shall see. \n\nKurakhove sector. As we saw above, it\u2019s not an easy situation for the 59th Motorized Brigade, which has responsibility for the important Karlivka-Nevelske-Krasnohorivka triangle. The northern part of which has already cracked. The soldiers of the 59th Brigade have so far held Nevelske admirably, with forward positions still in the western part of the village. However, it is highly likely that the Ukrainians will find themselves forced to abandon this triangle if the Russians have further success southwards, from Karlivka. In that case, the main defensive line would stand along the course of the Vovcha. \n\nIn Krasnohorivka, the situation has stabilized somewhat after the Russians captured the vast majority of the town. However, the Russians continue to try to advance westwards along Syedove and Zhovtneva Streets; moreover, they should control some houses in the northern bank of the Lozova River. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6442\n\nThey are also attacking along the Donetsk-Kurakhove railway westwards. Here elements of the 59th Motorized Brigade are fighting, reinforced by some battalions of the 117th and 118th TDF Brigades, and the 21st Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. On the Russian side, there are the 5th and 110th Motorized Brigades of the 51st CAA, reinforced by regiments of the Territorial Forces, and also the 346th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade. Last part below.",

                    "body": "The situation is not any easier further south. The Russians have been [geolocated](https://x.com/MikiValbuena/status/1829421335891624350) in the eastern part of Maksymilyanivka. At this point I highly doubt there are still Ukrainian positions in Heorhiivka, however fluid the situation is. This area is being defended by the 46th Airmobile Brigade, which is nevertheless doing a good job overall, destroying numerous units of Russian equipment. Units of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA are attacking in this area. \n\nFurther south, the Russians appear to be closing that Ukrainian salient between Pobjeda and Kostyantynivka. Ukraine\u2019s 33rd Mech Brigade continues to repel Russian attacks west of Pobjeda. The 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA is active between the latter village and Kostyantynivka.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6572\n\nThe 79th Air Assault Brigade, together with its \"dowries\", defends the area around Kostyantynivka. The village is being attacked by units of the 20th Motorized Division, by the 57th Motorized Regiment of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps and units of the 68th Corps. According to Russian sources, however, the 57th Regiment would be part of the 20th Division and no longer part of the 6th Division (the same thing happened in March to the 10th Tank Regiment, which switched from the 6th to the 20th Division). The Russians firmly control the eastern half of Kostyantynivka and are trying to occupy the western half, as well as having captured the part of the village north of Sukhi Yaly. Stormtroopers of the 57th Regiment have planted the Russian flag in the western end of Kostyantynivka, but at the moment there is no evidence they have consolidated in the area. Some Ukrainian positions most likely remain in the village.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6560\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6591\n\nVuhledar sector. Sharp deterioration of the situation in the left (from the Ukrainian pov) flank of the town. The Russians have now reached the O0532 Road in several points. Recently, the assault detachment of the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps has captured the large Ukrainian company-stronghold east of Vodiane. The 1472nd Regiment of the Territorial Forces is also active in the area. South-east of Vodiane, the Russians passed the O0532 Road, approaching the village.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6545\n\nThe Russian advance has been very costly not only in human terms but also in equipment, yet they are having success in putting Vuhledar in a troublesome corner, formed by the front line. The 72nd Mech Brigade, which has responsibility over the entire Vuhledar sector and is supported by several \"dowries\" (separate rifle battalions or territorial defense ones) is doing what it can to contain the Russian advance, though not without difficulty. Recently, for instance, problems have arisen with the 216th Battalion of the 125th TDF Brigade, attached to the 72nd Brigade, which has suffered heavy losses and lost positions, also due to problems of interaction with the command of the 72nd Brigade. \n\nThe Russians (specifically, the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA), are approaching the Pivdennodonbaska No. 1 Coal Mine, which remains fully in Ukrainian hands, however. To the south-west and south of Vuhledar the 29th CAA is active, with its 36th Motorized Brigade and 139th Separate Assault Battalion (unclear whether it\u2019s a brigade - Russian sources differ on this). In the last week the Russians have also become active in the right flank of Vuhledar, between Pavlivka and Shevchenko, an area that had seen few direct Russian attacks over the recent months. In the area there should be elements of the 36th Motorized Brigade, the 95th Rifle Regiment of the 51st CAA, the 1466th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, and several battalions of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade.\n\nHere the Russians were able to advance 4 km (according to DeepState), from Shevchenko to the Kashlahach River. In general, a Russian goal may be to bring the front in this area from the Shaitanka to the Kashlahach, in the direction of Prechystivka. We will see, in this regard, whether the Russians will also start actions from Novomaiorske. The objective is clearly to worsen the tactical situation around Vuhledar, with the potential goal of trying to \"close the matter\" during the fall, with an offensive involving the bulk of the forces of the GoF \"East\". \n\nVelyka Novosilka sector. After capturing Urozhaine, the 36th CAA together with a battalion of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade are trying to advance northwards, with slight successes, as well as in the forest belts to the north-east of the village.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6254\n\n The situation has stabilized in the western bank of the Mokri Yaly, responsibility of the 5th CAA - Makarivka is fully in Ukrainian hands. According to Mashovets, the 60th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA suffered major losses during the battle for Staromaiorske; elements of the 114th Motorized Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division (5th CAA), deployed in the Marfopil area, were moved to this area to support the offensive efforts of the 394th Motorized Regiment of the same division. Fighting in this sector has, anyway, lost intensity over the past month. \n\nHuliaipole sector. Nothing relevant to report.\n\nOrikhiv sector. The intensity of clashes significantly decreased compared to previous months. As we saw earlier, a very conspicuous part of the Ukrainian grouping deployed here was transferred to the Pokrovsk sector. At the same time, the Russians from this sector firstly removed, during the spring, the 76th VDV Division: this month a significant part of the 7th VDV Division and the 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th CAA. The remaining Ukrainian units (65th and 118th Mech Brigades, 141st Infantry Brigade, a few smaller units such as a battalion of the 107th TDF Brigade, a rifle battalion of the 5th Tank Brigade etc.) confront the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th CAA and the regiments of the Territorial Forces subordinate to it. If the situation calms down further, it is possible that the 118th Mech Brigade, with elements of it already partially in reserve, will also leave for other places.  \n\nThere have been some slight Russian advances, however, north of Robotyne, with Russians attempting to improve their positions to the detriment of Ukrainian ones, in the heights (so to speak) to the south of the Balka Uspenivska. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6538\n\nElements of the 7th VDV Division during late July have also captured an Ukrainian strongpoint south-west of Novopokrovka.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6153\n\nKamyanske sector. Nothing to report.\n\nKherson sector / Dnipro River. After finishing cleaning up Krynky (likely during the first week of July, that is when a channel associated with VDV units of the GoF \"Dnepr\" did not mention any more battles inside Krynky), fierce battles nevertheless are raging on the islands, where Ukrainian marines (mainly from the 35th Marine Brigade), along with elements of several TDF brigades (121st, 123rd, 124th, 126th) clash with Russian paratroopers (from the 104th VDV Division, but units from the 76th VDV Division are also present) and with 70th Motorized Division of the 18th CAA. \n\nLet\u2019s recall that from Nova Kakhovka to the mouth of the Dnipro there are almost a hundred kilometers of course of the river, dotted with marshy islands. According to the channel I mentioned above, there were preparations by the GoF \"Dnepr\" regarding potential but serious Dnipro-crossing activities (probably something comparable to Krynky), canceled later because of the transfer of units from here to Kursk and the resources that the Pokrovsk sector in particular needs. \n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3993\n\nThe GoF \"Dnepr\" is trying to rebuild the combat readiness of its units\u2019 assault detachments, but it has been weakened. In addition to the transfers from the Orikhiv sector that we saw above and the departure of the 45th Spetsnaz VDV Brigade from Kamyanske, the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and at least a detachment of the 10th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade left from Kherson Oblast, and there are Russian rumors that in the future (at least units of) the 76th and 104th VDV Divisions may leave; Mashovets also reported that the 80th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps may be moved from this sector to Kursk. The same channel reports that the worst-performing paratroopers of the 104th VDV Division are being transferred to the 70th Motorized Division (and to the 42nd Motorized Division too), as the 104th Division potentially prepares to leave the sector. This was confirmed today in a video protest.\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3921\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3928\n\nhttps://t. me/ne_zhdi_novosti/805\n\nThe same channel reports that former commander of the 35th CAA, Lt. Gen. Nyrkov, has become the head of the GoF \u201cDnepr\u201d, replacing Teplinsky. We will see if this is confirmed.\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/4006\n\nThat\u2019s all!",

On paper they should be brigades that specialize in fighting in forested areas, but in wartime these things become almost irrelevant (think of mountain units). Also they should have lighter equipment, e.g. MRAPs, IMVs and at most APCs instead of IFVs, but this is the case in a large share of mechanized brigades too.\n\nIn theory they should not have a tank unit, but the 68th Jager Brigade does (formally a battalion as far as I know, though most likely under-equipped). And they also have their own artillery group, unlike infantry brigades. The 68th Jager Brigade for example is very much comparable to a \"median\" mechanized brigade. The 71st Jager Brigade to my knowledge doesn't have a tank unit, but it's a particular brigade as it's part of the Air Assault Forces (the others of the Ground Forces). About the 13th Jager Brigade we know very little, but it is equipped with MRAPs and IMVs. The 152nd Jager Brigade in the past (when it was still named mechanized) was seen with BWP-1s; I don't know if they still have them (most likely they do, in my opinion), and as I said they also have Kirpi MRAPs as far as I could find. I doubt they have a tank unit though, but they are still more well structured than an infantry or territorial defense brigade, which are basically made up of several rifle battalions with some support companies.",

Exactly what will come of this long term, who knows, the UK isn\u2019t doing well economically, but the production lines aren\u2019t dead.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only option is to help Ukraine develop and increase production of their own missiles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have nothing against this concept, but I think it would be easier to leverage existing missile stockpiles and production capability, than to start up new cruise missiles from scratch. And if new missiles are needed, surely JASSM-ER is a better starting point than Neptune.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Last month marked the 2-year anniversary of the Olenivka prison blast that killed over 50 Ukrainian POWs. Russia blamed the attack on the Ukrainian use of GMLRS, but as had been previously reported by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/08/europe/olenivka-donetsk-prison-attack/index.html) (recommend reading), and others such as the WaPo and the FT, this was near impossible. At the time, theories were abound that the idea behind the atrocity was to withdraw U.S. support for Ukraine, or at least for HIMARS specifically. AP has an update on the story, including the U.N.'s own findings that ruled out GMLRS, as well as first-hand accounts from the POWs held at the camp. Unfortunately for the families, this is about as close to the truth as they're going to get for years and, perhaps, forever.  Excerpts:\n\n>[2 years after Ukrainian POW deaths, survivors and leaked UN analysis point to Russia as the culprit](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-pows-prison-prisoners-15561a6d5cafc5b61a1f2643009c2a2c)\n\n>The former prisoners of war still puzzle over the strange events leading up to the night now seared into their memories, when an explosion ripped through the Russian-controlled Olenivka prison barracks and killed so many comrades two years ago.\n\n>Among the survivors: Kyrylo Masalitin, whose months in captivity and long beard age him beyond his 30 years. Arsen Dmytryk, the informal commander of the group of POWs that was shifted without explanation to a room newly stocked with bare bunks. And Mykyta Shastun, who recalled guards laughing as the building burned, acting not at all like men under enemy attack.\n\n>\u201cBefore my eyes, there were guys who were dying, who were being revived, but it was all in vain,\u201d said Masalitin, who is back on the front line and treated as a father-figure by the men he commands.\n\n>The Associated Press interviewed over a dozen people with direct knowledge of details of the attack, including survivors, investigators and families of the dead and missing. All described evidence they believe points directly to Russia as the culprit. The AP also obtained an internal United Nations analysis that found the same.\n\n>Despite the conclusion of the internal analysis that found Russia planned and executed the attack, the U.N. stopped short of accusing Russia in public statements.\n\n>Of 193 Ukrainians in the barracks, less than two dozen made it back home. More than 50 died on the night of July 28, 2022. Around 120 are missing and believed detained somewhere in Russia. Russia accused Ukraine of striking its own men with U.S.-supplied missiles.\n\n>There are no active international investigations into the attack and a Ukrainian inquiry is one of tens of thousands of war crimes for investigators there, raising wider questions about whether those who committed crimes in occupied areas can ever face justice.\n\n>The U.N. has rejected Russia\u2019s claims that Ukrainian government HIMARS targeted the men, as do the victims who returned in prisoner exchanges, like Masalitin. \n\n>In the days following the Olenivka deaths, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres launched an independent mission to investigate. Russia refused to guarantee the mission\u2019s safety and its members never traveled either to occupied territory in the eastern Donetsk region or to Ukrainian-held territory. It dissolved five months later.\n\n>That team analyzed 70 open-source images, 20 statements by Russian officials along with 16 survivor interviews from Russian television. They conducted in-depth interviews with 55 freed POWs who were in the barracks or elsewhere in Olenivka during the attack. Their conclusion: Russia planned and executed the attack.\n\n>The lists of names the Russians drew up in late July 2022 had no explanation, no context. All the men listed were from the Azov unit who became national heroes after holding out for months against an overwhelmingly larger Russian force in the city of Mariupol. The prisoners were told to be ready. No one knew why.\n\n>On the morning of July 27, 2022, the group was rounded up and led to an industrial section of the colony, away from the other five POW barracks. They were taken to a cinder-block building with a tin-plate roof and 100 bunks, no mattresses and a hastily dug pit toilet, multiple survivors told AP.\n\n>\u201cEverything in the barracks was prepared very quickly,\u201d said Arsen Dmytryk, who outranked the others and became the informal leader. The barbed wire was cheap and flimsy, and there were machine tools inside, indicating that the building was recently a workshop.\n\n>The prison director visited to tell them that their old barracks were under renovation, although plenty of other prisoners had remained. Ukrainians who have been since released said there was no renovation.\n\n>That first day, the guards dug trenches for themselves, said Shastun. Ukraine\u2019s Security Service told AP that their analysis confirmed the presence of the unusual new trenches.\n\n>On July 28, the colony management ordered the guard post moved further away, and for the first time the barrack guards \u201cwore bullet-proof vests and helmets which they had not done before and unlike other colony personnel who rarely wore them,\u201d according to a section of the internal U.N. analysis later incorporated into public reports.\n\n>On the night of July 28 around 10:30 p.m., Dmytryk completed his checks, cut the lights, climbed into the top bunk and fell asleep at once. An explosion woke him perhaps 45 minutes later, followed by the sound of a Grad missile launcher. But he\u2019d heard that before and drifted back to sleep.\n\n>Ukrainian POWs elsewhere in the colony told the U.N. investigators that the Grad fire muffled sounds of the bigger explosions.\n\n>If Dmytryk\u2019s memories are a narrative of horror, Shastun\u2019s are more like disjointed film scenes. He recalled the guards just stood there laughing, tossing rags and flashlights at the panicked Ukrainians.\n\n>It took hours before POW medics were sent from the other barracks to help, around the same time as Russian forces brought in trucks and told survivors to load them with the most severely wounded.\n\n>\u201cWe carried them on stretchers, lifted them into the car, unloaded them and then ran back to get the other wounded,\u201d Shastun said. One person died in a comrade\u2019s arms. It was mid-morning when they finished, and the trucks were piled with bloody men.\n\n>The U.N. said in its public report of March 2023 that slow medical care worsened the death toll.\n\n>According to the analysis, other Ukrainian prisoners were then sent to the bombed barracks and ordered to remove debris and the remaining bodies. Two hours later, that group was sent into a nearby hangar, and some saw men in camouflage bringing boxes of ammunition to the blast site and setting HIMARS fragments on a blue bench nearby.\n\n>Russian officials soon arrived, accompanied by Russian journalists whose images of twisted, charred bunk beds, HIMARS fragments and bodies laid out in the sun spread across the world.\n\n>The Ukrainians in the nearby hangar said after everyone was gone, the men in camouflage returned everything to the boxes and left.\n\n>In July 2023, U.N. Human Rights chief Volker Turk publicly stated what the internal report had first said nearly a year before \u2014 that HIMARS were not responsible. Three months later, the U.N. devoted a section to Olenivka in its annual report on the human rights situation in Ukraine. Again, cribbing from the internal analysis, the report noted that HIMARS were not responsible, that the fragments shown by Russian officials were not \u201cin situ,\u201d the scene had been contaminated and physical evidence disturbed.\n\n>The report concluded that the damage \u201cappeared consistent with a projected ordnance having travelled with an east-to-west trajectory.\u201d It failed to note that Russia controlled the eastern territory.\n\n>A Ukrainian investigation is ongoing, according to Taras Semkiv of the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s war crimes unit. Semkiv said no international investigators have requested information from the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office since the deaths at Olenivka, including the disbanded U.N. fact-finding mission. He said initial optimism about the mission faded as soon as it became clear that they would not investigate at all if there was no access to the prison.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Last month marked the 2-year anniversary of the Olenivka prison blast that killed over 50 Ukrainian POWs. Russia blamed the attack on the Ukrainian use of GMLRS, but as had been previously reported by <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/08/europe/olenivka-donetsk-prison-attack/index.html\">CNN</a> (recommend reading), and others such as the WaPo and the FT, this was near impossible. At the time, theories were abound that the idea behind the atrocity was to withdraw U.S. support for Ukraine, or at least for HIMARS specifically.

Especially when it is day after day without break.  It takes you step by step through an assault as the journalist observed it.\n\n[NV journalist witnesses Russian assault near Pokrovsk and how Ukrainian artillery stopped it | New Voice of Ukraine | August 2024](https://english.nv.ua/nation/nv-journalist-witnesses-russian-assault-near-pokrovsk-and-how-ukrainian-artillery-stopped-it-50447312.html)\n\nBut the main takeaways were Russian drone activity has increased.\n\n*\u201cLancets, enemy artillery... There were almost no FPVs before, specifically FPVs weren\u2019t working against us here. But recently they have started appearing. Just yesterday, we heard FPVs at night. The biggest difficulty for us is when the position is detected, and one or two, sometimes even three, Lancets arrive. Even if they all miss, we still have to change positions because it is no longer safe to operate. These \u2018relocations\u2019 are the most difficult,\u201d Dym says.*\n\nTheir artillery is accurate but old.  They take steps to prevent wear on the barrel.\n\n*The main advantage is very high accuracy. The main disadvantage is age. Dym briefly describes the gun. Over the years, wear and tear on the barrel and other mechanisms has reduced the ability to use the gun at maximum distances. However, at medium distances, the self-propelled howitzer still performs excellently.*\n\n*\u201cThis is the charge we used to stop that assault. We decided not to use the \u2018powder\u2019 meant for long distances. It negatively affects the barrel of the gun. So we used these, we call them \u2018toy shells.\u2019\u201d*\n\n*In the artilleryman\u2019s hands is a charge that is visually half the size of the standard. For firing, shells \u2014 the direct means of targeting \u2014 and charges, or \u201cpowder\u201d \u2014 the explosive substance that propels the shell from the gun \u2014 are used. The commander says that when he first saw these charges, he was even worried if they would have enough explosive power to propel the shell safely from the gun. But over time, it was discovered that such \u201cpowder\u201d can send a shell 6-8 km and has its advantages, including a quieter and less visually noticeable shot. This is especially important at night when the flash from the gunshot could reveal the position to the enemy.*\n\nThe artillery ammo supply situation is better and they get regular deliveries.\n\n*Regarding the shortage of ammunition, Dym claims that the situation has improved. This 33rd Brigade crew primarily uses American shells and charges. For example, the \u201ctoy powders\u201d shown to the journalist were produced in 1970. Cassette ammunition from the same years is also in use. Nevertheless, they work well and reliably.*\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s much better now. Regular deliveries. Previously, we were at Orikhiv (in Zaporizhzhya Oblast \u2014 editor\u2019s note) \u2014 it was a disaster. Sometimes there were only five shells at the position. Here, we can receive 15-20 daily. If we use a lot, they can bring 30 in a day. So, it\u2019s clear that it will never be enough. But for the targets we are given, we have enough to work with.\u201d*\n\nLittle bit of annoyance at the hype and extra benefits that the drone forces are getting.   \n\n*The three pieces of equipment moving toward the 33rd Brigade\u2019s area of responsibility faced different fates. One tank changed direction and moved towards another brigade\u2019s positions, which were beyond the range of Dima\u2019s gun. One vehicle turned around and began to retreat. However, another tank was hit by artillery fire from a neighboring friendly crew. The artillery shell did not destroy the vehicle completely but stopped it. Within a minute, the enemy tank was struck by an FPV drone.*\n\n*\u201cAs always, now all the glory goes to FPV! There will be a great video of it burning and exploding. But few understand that the equipment still needs to be stopped. And many can finish it off! Do they pay us for destroyed equipment? Not once,\u201d the officer controlling the tank strikes says with a hint of irony. It is the first moment he allows himself open emotions; before this, he appeared highly focused.*\n\nA sergeant major of the 33rd offers his view on the difference between Kurakhove direction compared to the neighboring Pokrovsk. \n\n*At one of the training grounds of the 33rd Brigade, new recruits are being prepared. Among the instructors is a \u201cstar\u201d of the battalion, as his comrades joke. The fighter with the call sign Bars joined the army only a year ago but has already risen to the position of battalion sergeant major. In the summer of 2024, he and several comrades played a crucial role in stopping enemy assaults in the Kurakhove direction, and Bars himself had experience capturing enemy troops.*\n\n*Bars disagrees that the Kurakhove direction is quieter or less of a priority for the Russians compared to the neighboring Pokrovsk direction. As evidence, the sergeant cites the fact that during the time he and his comrades were capturing Russians, enemy assaults were repeated for 18 consecutive days. However, there were no advancements or successes for the occupiers. OSINT observers confirm that the front line in this direction has hardly moved.*\n\n*\u201cFirstly, we have fields here. The landscape is somewhat different. It is possible to work much more effectively against infantry with cluster munitions. Also, it must be understood that the enemy does not have many trained and motivated units. They look for weak points in the defense and throw their troops there. If we talk simply about \u2018cannon fodder,\u2019 then yes, the enemy has it in abundance. But there are very few motivated soldiers. We recently observed with a drone on our direction when an occupier shot himself next to an armored vehicle because he refused to go into battle. From prisoners, we know that threats of execution and various physical punishments, beatings, etc., are used. This is especially widespread in Storm Z units, which are also present in our area,\u201d says Bars.*",

If the West would be willing to enter direct war with Russia in the future when Ukraine is collapsing, why aren't we willing to now? \n\n\nI can think of a few reasons\n\n1. The west is hoping to save Ukraine without risking escalation. This is done by either hoping Ukraine can win or that it can hold out. This is the preferred way to do it. But it might not work\n\n2. Political. The west has said a long time that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and the importance of Russia loosing due to the global order and maintaining the stability. If we let Ukraine fall that means all we said was meaningless\n\n3. Investment. WE have invested a lot of political power, supplies and weapons into Ukraine. Letting Ukraine fall at the start is one thing. Not after years of support worth a ton\n\n4. Russia itself\n\nI think this is the most important part overall for both political and genuine strategic/existential reasons.\n\nWhen we first did not intervene we did it on a belief that Russia was not as ruthless, determined, fanatic and evil as it has shown itself to be. \nMany thought after some thousand of casualties and initial setback russia would be reasonable and stop. But it has not\n\nPutin and russia itself has taken on a dark form of imperialism/hate towards the west, entered a semi war economy and putins regime is now relying on that hate and fanaticism to keep itself going.\n\nRussia is now a nation on a course we can not let it stay on. WE can not let such a nation simply win and be rewarded. We now know Russia is a much more dangerous and ruthless nation then we thought it was at the start of 2022.\n\nLetting Russia win now puts its border nations at risk and can very much set the groundwork for a future larger scale conflict.\n\nThere is no telling what route Russia will go if it wins in Ukraine. Hence it would be in the west interest to stop it and go with the more safe option of assuring a stalemate or defeat in Ukraine where Russia is left \"powerless\" to do much else and remains as it is and hope things calm down there. Not ideal but the best we can hope for.\n\nWe did not act with this knowledge in 2022. \n\nWhen we began to understand just how twisted, evil and determined to regain its imperial ambition Russia truly was we still hoped it could loose by supporting Ukraine and keeping escalation at a minimum. After all why risk it however small IF we can just let Ukraine win by supporting it and surely Russia will tire eventually.\n\nBut ultimately letting Russia win after all this and how fanatical and extreme russia has grown would quite frankly be a disaster.\n\nIf minimal escalation and supporting Ukraine alone cant put a stop to it...i can see reasons why some nations feel that opportunity has passed and there is now no choice but to step in, in some way to not let Russia win or take all of Ukraine because in the long term it would be a huge liability for stability or preventing a larger war. Do you really think Poland,Finland Romania,Moldova,Baltic state will feel safe or want Russia at their gates after the evil, ruthlessness and determination it has showed in Ukraine(and managed to win and not been defeated or a mild stalemate)\n\nThat just my take on why i think the idea of intervention or larger involvement is not impossible despite not doing so up till now\n\nEssentially our global order can not allow such a blatant imperialistic nation throwing hundreds of thousands to their deaths in a war of conquest win right at our own borders in such a potentially unstable unpredictable state.",
