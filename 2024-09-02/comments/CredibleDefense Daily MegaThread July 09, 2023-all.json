It was primarily about the status of the Ukrainian offensive. \n\nBig takeaways:\n\n* Ukraine's offensive has been ongoing for about a month and they've captured around 150-200 square km of territory. Ukrainian offensive has not been the wild success some hoped for, but its well within reasonable expectations at the moment. Original Ukrainian plan of pushing to Russian defensive lines, blowing a hole in them, and then pushing forces through them so quickly Russian can't respond was always overly optimistic. \n\n* Again repeated that we self-select for ground taken as a measure of success, but that's not the best way to analyze success on the offensive, it's more important what the state of both forces are as a result of the fighting. That being said, it's hard to tell what the state of both forces are, Russia seems to be suffering a lot of attrition but still holding firm. Ukraine has suffered considerable losses, but seems to still be in good shape. \n\n* Ukraine still has a lot of offensive potential left, with large reserve forces that haven't joined the fight, but after failures to gain much ground early on, they've shifted tactics to an attritional fight. Ukraine should have an advantage in this kind of fight due to having more PGMs than Russia. Noted the tradeoff of attritional battles are that they use more ammo and give time for defender to reallocate forces and build more lines. \n\n* Again reiterated both that this offensive is likely to be like Kherson except more difficult as Russian forces aren't as supply constrained and also that this war goes through phases of attrition followed by maneuver. Kofman expects that Ukraine will make another major push in coming weeks after they feel they've done enough attrition. \n\n* Ukraine's biggest hold up is its supply of ammunition. West has moved far too slowly on this front, especially Europe. Kofman also noted that he thinks most recent 155mm provisions are from South Korean stockpile. \n\n* **As such, the provision of DPICMS is a big deal to Ukrainian war effort, more important than ATACMS or F16s.** Provision of DPICMS unlocks large new sources of munitions (mostly from US stockpiles, but Kofman thinks other countries will provide cluster munitions as well). He said that provision of cluster munitions has the potential to \"solve\" Ukraine's artillery munitions issue and is also a net positive for US as well as we clear out old stockpiles without needing to go through expensive decommissioning process. \n\n* Still to early to tell how the Western-equipped forces are doing.

The gains they made during their initial advances will be by far their easiest gains if they can\u2019t force a breakthrough and have to continue their attritional fighting phase. \n\nThere has been a shocking amount of Russian footage uploaded recently. There has been a huge uptick of fpv strikes on infantry/equipment and lancet drone strikes. There are multiple videos of entire Ukrainian squads getting wiped out by ATGM strikes and mines.

            "body": "The narrow front argument isn't really one. Before the invasion of Normandy the strategy was already set up: land, resist the panzer counterattack, establish lodgement, breakout with  21st Army Group takes Channel ports for their logistics, First Army holding their right flank, with Third Army goes to Brittany to open those ports for American shipping while Dever's 6th Army Group lands in southern France. That outflanks the Seine defenses. Then drive to the border with Germany, break through the West Wall. Get into Germany, take the Ruhr valley industrial area, destroying German manufacturing capacity, forcing them to surrender. It was supposed to be done on a broad front, 21st Army Group, 12th Army Group, 6th Army Group. However, the prize would likely go to the British because they were on the left flank, the better route into Germany, but many US Army generals were pushing for a Saar push to break in, another long-standing invasion route into Germany. \n\nThen after Overlord actually happened, the plan mostly went out the window. Germany didn't do what we thought they'd do and counterattack, fail, and fall back on the Seine, they fought tooth and nail to hold every inch of Normandy, which didn't make military sense but sure screwed with the timetable. Then the First Army scored the breakout, but instead of fully following the existing plan to go west to Brittany they went east, caused the Falaise encirclement, which routed two German field armies with a period of chaotic retreat known in German history as \"The Void.\"\n\nDue to logistical problems caused by lack of being able to take an intact major port (Germans destroyed them or fought on), the Allied logistical situation was bad. Add to that they hadn't planned to logistically support three army groups 400-500 miles away from Normandy and Marseilles. \n\nIt was during the advance across France and into the Low Countries and French border with Germany where the debate started. The Allied brass incorrectly guessed the Germans were on the ropes, which means neither broad front or narrow was going to work anyway, not in 1944. \n\nMonty wanted priority of supply, to keep his title as Ground Force Commander (making Bradley and Devers his subordinates instead of peers), then have most US units perform limited fixing attacks only while British Second Army (the weakest of them all) would be the main effort, with Canadian First Army and parts of US First Army stripped away and given to Monty, and then used to hold his flanks while the British divisions were the main effort. I think the plan called for a total of 30 divisions involved in the narrow thrust.\n\nThe only part that made sense was that British Second Army did have the theoretical better route (due to location that was for logistics sake) to get into Germany first and into the Ruhr (then again, Canadian First Army was going to be stuck clearing the Atlantic coast for months). Meanwhile, the reality was that 6th Army Group was already about to cross the Rhine into Germany already (and then be told to retreat, because that route is the ridiculously indirect way to reach the Ruhr), while 12th Army group was pretty well set up with First Army and especially Third Army better positioned to continue advance. \n\nSo Ike's decision:\n\n1) Concede to Monty, especially with the dangers of flanks of narrow thrust, and disregarding US policy and instructions from Marshall to NOT give the British any more power and prestige (payback time from being \"low man\" for two years)\n2) Give Bradley the main effort, pissing off the British and Churchill, who literally calls Ike nearly daily or makes him come to London where he does hysterics and fake cries to try to get his way.\n3) Compromise, do Broad front as the plan called for, while operationally still making the British the main effort during Market Garden, which placates them.\n\nAnd remember, it wouldn't matter. The same time the Allied brass were assured that the Germans were done, the Germans were preparing two panzer armies for a counteroffensive that they'd started prepping the same time Monty started pushing for a narrow thrust effort he'd control. So again, the whole discussion is moot, neither strategy would have ended the war in 44, the Germans weren't beat yet.",

Germany didn&#39;t do what we thought they&#39;d do and counterattack, fail, and fall back on the Seine, they fought tooth and nail to hold every inch of Normandy, which didn&#39;t make military sense but sure screwed with the timetable. Then the First Army scored the breakout, but instead of fully following the existing plan to go west to Brittany they went east, caused the Falaise encirclement, which routed two German field armies with a period of chaotic retreat known in German history as &quot;The Void.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Due to logistical problems caused by lack of being able to take an intact major port (Germans destroyed them or fought on), the Allied logistical situation was bad. Add to that they hadn&#39;t planned to logistically support three army groups 400-500 miles away from Normandy and Marseilles. </p>\n\n<p>It was during the advance across France and into the Low Countries and French border with Germany where the debate started. The Allied brass incorrectly guessed the Germans were on the ropes, which means neither broad front or narrow was going to work anyway, not in 1944. </p>\n\n<p>Monty wanted priority of supply, to keep his title as Ground Force Commander (making Bradley and Devers his subordinates instead of peers), then have most US units perform limited fixing attacks only while British Second Army (the weakest of them all) would be the main effort, with Canadian First Army and parts of US First Army stripped away and given to Monty, and then used to hold his flanks while the British divisions were the main effort. I think the plan called for a total of 30 divisions involved in the narrow thrust.</p>\n\n<p>The only part that made sense was that British Second Army did have the theoretical better route (due to location that was for logistics sake) to get into Germany first and into the Ruhr (then again, Canadian First Army was going to be stuck clearing the Atlantic coast for months). Meanwhile, the reality was that 6th Army Group was already about to cross the Rhine into Germany already (and then be told to retreat, because that route is the ridiculously indirect way to reach the Ruhr), while 12th Army group was pretty well set up with First Army and especially Third Army better positioned to continue advance. </p>\n\n<p>So Ike&#39;s decision:</p>\n\n<p>1) Concede to Monty, especially with the dangers of flanks of narrow thrust, and disregarding US policy and instructions from Marshall to NOT give the British any more power and prestige (payback time from being &quot;low man&quot; for two years)\n2) Give Bradley the main effort, pissing off the British and Churchill, who literally calls Ike nearly daily or makes him come to London where he does hysterics and fake cries to try to get his way.\n3) Compromise, do Broad front as the plan called for, while operationally still making the British the main effort during Market Garden, which placates them.</p>\n\n<p>And remember, it wouldn&#39;t matter. The same time the Allied brass were assured that the Germans were done, the Germans were preparing two panzer armies for a counteroffensive that they&#39;d started prepping the same time Monty started pushing for a narrow thrust effort he&#39;d control. So again, the whole discussion is moot, neither strategy would have ended the war in 44, the Germans weren&#39;t beat yet.</p>\n</div>",

So all Putin needed to keep fighting till his enemies lost patience was manpower, and to keep his conscripts out of combat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And perhaps the Ukrainians feel they do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let&#39;s not forget that WWII ended with the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditDayOf/comments/1zfign/the_occupiers_of_berlin_marshal_gk_zhukov_and/\">leaders of the Allied armies</a> receiving their medals at the Brandenburg Gate. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like everybody else who matters, Zelenskyy knows only too well that the war must end in a negotiation because nobody is going to march on Moscow to force the Russians to surrender. Talk of \u201cregime change\u201d may offer a seductive promise for some, but it mostly demonstrates a feckless over-optimism about its feasibility, while also ignoring the likelihood that Putin\u2019s replacement will promise not peace but a more effectively prosecuted war. Prigozhin was applauded so enthusiastically in Rostov precisely because he called to fire the losers still charge; the Russians want generals who can march to Kyiv as Zhukov marched to Berlin in 1945. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The UKR-RUS war is an <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2022/09/russias-gentlemanly-war/\">18th century &quot;limited war&quot;</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Ukraine war is not an all-out war like the First or Second World Wars. It is a \u201climited war\u201d, with US and Russian embassies still functioning in Moscow and Washington, US and Russian astronauts sharing space capsules, concerned phone calls by the CIA director when Moscow is briefly in turmoil. It is bound by reciprocal restraint. The Russians do not attack US aircraft and vessels bringing weapons to their enemy, the Americans do not supply weapons to Ukraine that can attack Russian cities. Putin himself has silenced threats of nuclear attacks by Russian hotheads, declaring that he would only use nuclear weapons if Russia were faced with imminent destruction \u2014 that is, inevitably, nuclear destruction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It has been going on for 500 days. It can easily go on for another 500.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[New WSJ article on the Ukrainian offensive: Why the Ukraine Counteroffensive Is Such Slow Going - Outgunned, outmanned and facing a deeply entrenched enemy, Ukrainian troops are attempting one of the most daunting operations a military can undertake\n](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-war-counteroffensive-frontlines-russia-add3e4e4?ns=prod/accounts-wsj)\n\nOn a hilltop near the occupied southern Ukrainian town of Polohy, Russian forces set up an observation point that can spot Ukrainian soldiers more than 6 miles away. Four times, Ukrainian forces destroyed the Murom-M surveillance system, said Lt. Col. Oleksiy Telehin, of Ukraine\u2019s 108th Territorial Defense brigade. Four times, the Russians promptly installed a new one. \n\nUkraine successfully outmaneuvered Russia\u2019s far larger invading forces last year, despite being outmanned, outgunned and vastly overpowered in the air. With a nimble approach, superior knowledge of the terrain and the efficient use of drones and digital technology, its units were able to repel a far larger army that often seemed lumbering and mired in bureaucracy.\n\nThat\u2019s all over. Ukraine is now attempting to dislodge an entrenched enemy, one of the most daunting operations any military can undertake. Russian troops have spent months building physical defenses that include bunkers, tank traps and minefields\u2014some more than 15 miles deep. \n\nIn this phase of the war, Ukraine\u2019s lack of resources is proving as much of a challenge as the dug-in Russian defenses. Despite the delivery of new Western weapons in recent months\u2014and a promise by the U.S. Friday to send deadly cluster munitions in the future\u2014Kyiv\u2019s effort to push south through Russian territory toward the Sea of Azov has stalled. Though Ukrainian officials say they are making progress, and have reclaimed a handful of villages in the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions over the past month, they also acknowledge the herculean nature of their task.\n\n\u201cIf we kill a whole unit\u2014100 soldiers\u2014the next day they will bring another unit. And the day after, another,\u201d Lt. Col. Telehin said. \n\nFor Russian forces, who earlier this year tried to take more Ukrainian territory, \u201cthe offensive wasn\u2019t successful, but holding defensive positions will be easier,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a specialist in security studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. He pointed to the Russian mobilization of more than 250,000 troops last year.\n\nUkrainian soldiers said the Russians in the Zaporizhzhia region have constructed miles of zigzagging, interconnected trenches, some of them reinforced with concrete, or covered with wood-and-earth roofs so they are difficult to spot using drones. Fields are heavily mined. In at least two cases, Ukrainian soldiers said, the bodies of their killed comrades had been mined as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to completely destroy such a well-prepared position before advancing,\u201d said a 38-year-old rifle unit commander in the 108th brigade, who goes by the call sign Vados. To be able to take it, he said, Ukrainian artillery forces would need to first bombard the area and then advance with armored vehicles to bring in infantry. A shortage of tanks and other armored vehicles has made that strategy hard to execute, he said. \n\nAssaulting entrenched occupiers has been a grinding feat even for the world\u2019s top armed forces. Allies in World War II, after gaining a beachhead in France on D-Day, needed more than two months to break through German blockades and push inland. In 1991, before coalition land forces advanced in Operation Desert Storm, the U.S. led a five-week air campaign to wear down Iraqi positions.\n\nUkraine lacks the firepower and air-superiority that America and its partners had in those fights. Kyiv\u2019s air force consists of a small number of Soviet-era fighter jets and helicopters, some supplied by former East Bloc allies now in NATO. \n\nThe Russians, meanwhile, are deploying advanced Sukhoi fighter jets and Ka-52 helicopters across the southern front.\n\nPoland, a staunch ally of Ukraine, recently sent Kyiv about a dozen Soviet-designed Mi-24 helicopter gunships, according to people familiar with the matter, in a transfer not previously disclosed. But Ukraine\u2019s fleet remains small compared with Russia\u2019s, with less sophisticated targeting and defensive systems. Kyiv uses it sparingly to avoid losing aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainians have made gains, but they face fierce fighting, tough terrain and well-prepared Russian defensive lines,\u201d said North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. He said the situation is \u201can argument for continuing our support.\u201d\n\nAt NATO\u2019s summit this week in Lithuania, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is slated to attend, alliance leaders will \u201csend the message that we will be there for as long as it takes,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \n\nNATO countries are discussing sending Ukraine U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, but the planes are unlikely to enter the war this year. Lacking F-16s, Ukraine is lobbying allies for shells of all sizes\u2014from machine gun bullets to artillery projectiles. \n\nThe U.S. recently said it would send Ukraine cluster munitions, which have the potential to kill or wound more Russians. Fired from artillery, the shells spew small bomblets over a wide area. Their downside is that some fail to explode, potentially endangering civilians after a conflict ends.\n\nKyiv is trying to soften the Russian defenses before sending troops in, but doesn\u2019t have enough ammunition to simply flatten Russian-held villages, as the Russians did in Bakhmut and other parts of eastern Ukraine. Instead, Ukrainian troops usually make artillery strikes only if they have confirmed Russian positions with drones. \n\nSoldiers said a lack of armored vehicles was also slowing their efforts to advance. Speaking recently from a command post in the Zaporizhzhia region, Vados, the rifle-unit commander, said that his unit had tried to assault a Russian-held village the previous day. As Ukrainian infantry advanced on foot, the Russians moved to surround them.\n\n\u201cIf we had more vehicles, we could have brought more infantry to the flanks,\u201d Vados, a lieutenant, said. Instead, the unit retreated without taking the village. In the month since the offensive began, Vados said he hasn\u2019t been part of an operation that successfully seized a well-prepared Russian position. \n\nUkraine still hasn\u2019t thrown into battle much of its best new Western equipment. Kyiv has dozens of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, but after several of them got stuck in minefields in early June, they haven\u2019t been seen on the battlefield. Some brigades that were spared from the fighting earlier this year to train on the Western equipment also haven\u2019t been used since the offensive began.\n\nMilitary analysts believe Ukraine is still probing for weak spots before committing the bulk of its Western weaponry. The reconnaissance is difficult because Russians can often see Ukrainians approaching across open ground.\n\nRussia\u2019s hilltop lookout post near Polohy proved particularly frustrating. A rare rise in a region of fields, it gives Moscow\u2019s troops a big advantage. \n\nHigh ground has always been the most valuable terrain in warfare and also the most contested, forming the centerpiece of fights from the first-century siege of Masada to the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nUkrainian officials have declined throughout the war to discuss casualty figures. But soldiers on the southern front say that a unit can sometimes lose dozens of men in one assault. \n\nA 19-year-old combat medic, who goes by the call sign Bald, said he made three runs to pick up injured comrades during a recent assault, transporting eight men to stabilization points. Earlier in the summer, a mortar hit his car during an evacuation. Another vehicle came to pick up the growing number of wounded.\n\n\u201cWe had to evacuate the evacuation team,\u201d he said. \n\nUkrainian forces have shot down some of Russia\u2019s helicopters in recent weeks. One soldier from an antiaircraft unit near the border of the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions said Russian choppers sometimes fly within 5 miles of Ukrainian troops. The proximity improves Russian attackers\u2019 accuracy, but also leaves them vulnerable. The soldier said he shot down two in one week last month, using Soviet-era antiaircraft systems. \n\nStill, infantry say the aircrafts remain a menace. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have proper air defense systems to deal with the threat,\u201d said Dmytro, a 40-year-old platoon commander in the 108th brigade. \u201cWhen we\u2019re warned that an enemy plane has taken off, the only way to deal with it is to take cover.\u201d \n\nThe region of mostly flat, open fields separated by thin treelines offers little protection. In the spring, some troops who fought in the area questioned whether an offensive could succeed here, given the landscape. \n\nThe difficulty of the task hasn\u2019t been a surprise, Lt. Col. Telehin said.\n\n\u201cWe knew that to be able to move forward against such well prepared defenses,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019d need experience, resources and surprise.\u201d",

                            "body": "IMO, the current  Ukrainian strategy is flawed. \n\nFor whatever reason, they think they need to score a big win to retake the Land Bridge, but that's not going to really move the war any closer to ending. Let's say the best hope happens and their dual prongs against Melitipol and Mariupol both work. Minus a massive operational encirclement without a successful Dunkirk type evacuation (very unlikely), at best that means the land in between them to the Azov coast is liberated. Still great news, the Russians lose the Land Bridge, but they still hold most of Kherson oblast east of the river, and then Crimea, both of which would necessitate two completely further offensives, the latter of which will need to include most of the UAF force structure, and will be far more bloody and costly than anything they've done. In the east, the Russians simple retreat a bit and nothing else happens, they'll still hold the Donbas until another MASSIVE offensive is performed to try to push them out, but unfortunately their existing border has no natural terrain feature to defend from (at least not entirely on the east). \n\nSo they're working on a strategy, one that is BLATANTLY obvious (and thus why the Russians can defend so well) to pursue a strategy that at best takes until 2028 or so to win. \n\nI hate attritional strategy but if its all that's left, then they need to use it. But not long term, the current situation Ukraine faces, totally reliant on foreign aid, they shouldn't even bother to be focusing on long term strategy, it's pointless, too much is going to change shortly.

With the the measures designed to minimize the effects on member states, the impact on the EU has been contained but it has been \u201ctangible\u201d in some areas mostly due to Russia\u2019s counter-measures and because of the war itself, and the resulting rise in prices, according to the document.\n\n> The assessment notes that European industry has reported a few \u201csevere\u201d import-related supply chain disruptions on rare gases such as neon and xenon that are used to produce chips. Rail freight between the EU and China transiting via Russia has fallen and the import ban on wood products as well as Russian countermeasures has contributed to price increases and some supply issues, especially for plywood and oak.\n\n> EU exports to and imports from Russia have fallen by more than 50% compared to 2021 resulting in \u201can unprecedented decoupling,\u201d the assessment says. This has led to technology-dependent processing industries to shrink particularly fast, with high and medium-high technology manufacturing recording a 13% annual loss.\n\n>For exports of dual-use items and advanced technology the fall is particularly steep, dropping 78% in 2022 compared to 2019-2021.\n\n>Still, Moscow has been able to hoard some materials as well as source some banned goods and other substitute technologies from third countries including China, Kazakhstan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n> The assessment notes that China has been exporting record volumes of some goods. It questions, however, Moscow\u2019s ability to easily source key items noting that the measures \u201care designed to target key capital and intermediate goods where Russia\u2019s dependency on supplies from the EU, United Kingdom, United States and Japan is over 60% and where China currently supplies less than 25% (i.e. areas where Chinese businesses have limited capacity to fill the gaps).\u201d\n\n> That is why much of the EU\u2019s most recent efforts have been focused on enforcing restrictions and cracking down on Russia\u2019s ability to get around sanctions, including through third countries.\n\n>The report estimates that nearly a third of Russia\u2019s federal budget will be spent on defense and domestic security this year. Russian steel production was down 7% last year compared to 2021 and a further 10% drop is expected this year. \n\n>\u201cFar beyond their immediate impact, the EU\u2019s import restrictions filter deeply into the fabric of Russia\u2019s economy,\u201d according to the document. \n\n>> What Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n>\u201cSanctions, and the cost of the war effort, will have a slow-burning impact on Russia\u2019s long-term growth prospects. Broken connections with the rest of the world mean inefficient local firms gain a stranglehold on the domestic market, denting productivity growth.\u201d\n\n> Meanwhile, the impact of measures introduced by the EU and its Group of Seven allies on Russia\u2019s energy sector, including a price cap on oil, has been mixed.\n\n>Moscow has been able to divert some lost sales to countries such as China, India and Turkey but these have often commanded significant discounts of some $30 relative to the price of Brent, the assessment notes.\n\n>An export ban on oil refining and gas liquefaction technologies has made it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries to the necessary export standards, the document says.\n\n>While the vast majority of EU member states have been able to halt their imports of Russian oil and source supplies elsewhere, a few nations, including Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, continue to depend on Moscow\u2019s crude.\n\n>A rise in commodity and energy prices following the beginning of the war has also been more severe in the EU compared to some of its allies, including the US and Japan, affecting the bloc\u2019s competitiveness. Several member states have experienced periods of recession since early 2022.\n\n> As of the end of June, the commission has approved more than 250 national measures to mitigate the economic impact of the war for a total cost of around \u20ac730 billion.\n\n> Restrictions on Russian steel have not caused significant supply issues as goods have been mostly replaced with imports from other countries.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-07/eu-says-high-cost-of-sanctions-on-russia-will-grow-for-years\">EU Says Cost of Sanctions Will Hit Russia Harder Over Time</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>EU\u2019s sanctions impact report says the cost to Russia will grow</li>\n<li>Moscow\u2019s industrial, technology capacity has been degraded</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The European Union\u2019s sanctions against Russia will build over time and will have a growing long-term impact on Moscow\u2019s economy, according to the bloc\u2019s executive arm.</p>\n\n<p>An impact assessment prepared by the European Commission and seen by Bloomberg outlines the effects on Moscow due to the bloc\u2019s sanctions, which have cut off around \u20ac91 billion ($99.1 billion) in imports from Russia and which cover \u20ac48 billion of EU exports.</p>\n\n<p>The sanctions have \u201csignificantly degraded Russia\u2019s industrial and technological capacity,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThese effects will further intensify over time, as the measures have a structural, long-term impact on Russia\u2019s budget, financial markets, foreign investment and its industrial and technological base.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The EU has sanctioned almost 1,500 people and 250 entities since Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukraine, starting with its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and followed by its invasion of Ukraine in February last year. With the the measures designed to minimize the effects on member states, the impact on the EU has been contained but it has been \u201ctangible\u201d in some areas mostly due to Russia\u2019s counter-measures and because of the war itself, and the resulting rise in prices, according to the document.</p>\n\n<p>The assessment notes that European industry has reported a few \u201csevere\u201d import-related supply chain disruptions on rare gases such as neon and xenon that are used to produce chips. Rail freight between the EU and China transiting via Russia has fallen and the import ban on wood products as well as Russian countermeasures has contributed to price increases and some supply issues, especially for plywood and oak.</p>\n\n<p>EU exports to and imports from Russia have fallen by more than 50% compared to 2021 resulting in \u201can unprecedented decoupling,\u201d the assessment says. This has led to technology-dependent processing industries to shrink particularly fast, with high and medium-high technology manufacturing recording a 13% annual loss.</p>\n\n<p>For exports of dual-use items and advanced technology the fall is particularly steep, dropping 78% in 2022 compared to 2019-2021.</p>\n\n<p>Still, Moscow has been able to hoard some materials as well as source some banned goods and other substitute technologies from third countries including China, Kazakhstan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.</p>\n\n<p>The assessment notes that China has been exporting record volumes of some goods. It questions, however, Moscow\u2019s ability to easily source key items noting that the measures \u201care designed to target key capital and intermediate goods where Russia\u2019s dependency on supplies from the EU, United Kingdom, United States and Japan is over 60% and where China currently supplies less than 25% (i.e. areas where Chinese businesses have limited capacity to fill the gaps).\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That is why much of the EU\u2019s most recent efforts have been focused on enforcing restrictions and cracking down on Russia\u2019s ability to get around sanctions, including through third countries.</p>\n\n<p>The report estimates that nearly a third of Russia\u2019s federal budget will be spent on defense and domestic security this year. Russian steel production was down 7% last year compared to 2021 and a further 10% drop is expected this year. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cFar beyond their immediate impact, the EU\u2019s import restrictions filter deeply into the fabric of Russia\u2019s economy,\u201d according to the document. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What Bloomberg Economics Says...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cSanctions, and the cost of the war effort, will have a slow-burning impact on Russia\u2019s long-term growth prospects. Broken connections with the rest of the world mean inefficient local firms gain a stranglehold on the domestic market, denting productivity growth.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the impact of measures introduced by the EU and its Group of Seven allies on Russia\u2019s energy sector, including a price cap on oil, has been mixed.</p>\n\n<p>Moscow has been able to divert some lost sales to countries such as China, India and Turkey but these have often commanded significant discounts of some $30 relative to the price of Brent, the assessment notes.</p>\n\n<p>An export ban on oil refining and gas liquefaction technologies has made it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries to the necessary export standards, the document says.</p>\n\n<p>While the vast majority of EU member states have been able to halt their imports of Russian oil and source supplies elsewhere, a few nations, including Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, continue to depend on Moscow\u2019s crude.</p>\n\n<p>A rise in commodity and energy prices following the beginning of the war has also been more severe in the EU compared to some of its allies, including the US and Japan, affecting the bloc\u2019s competitiveness. Several member states have experienced periods of recession since early 2022.</p>\n\n<p>As of the end of June, the commission has approved more than 250 national measures to mitigate the economic impact of the war for a total cost of around \u20ac730 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions on Russian steel have not caused significant supply issues as goods have been mostly replaced with imports from other countries. Similarly, disruptions to imports of most critical raw materials \u2013 which are not sanctioned \u2013 have so far been avoided, with imports of aluminum, nickel, palladium and titanium all holding steady. The assessment notes that iron ore, where imports from Russia have fallen 85%, is a notable exception.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the war itself has disrupted supply chains and caused some shortages in raw materials, and companies have had to find new routes at higher prices, the assessment acknowledges.</p>\n\n<p>According to the report, the sanctions \u201chave considerably limited Moscow\u2019s political and economic options, caused financial strain, cut the country from key markets, increased the costs of trading and significantly degraded Russia\u2019s industrial and technological capacity.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the risk of missing the forest for the trees, there are some granular points I\u2019d take issue with, like how far the EU says it\u2019s gone and how far it\u2019s actually gone or could go, and O\u2019Brien\u2019s comments on poor Chinese QA that the Russians have been complaining about, but the bigger points here are far more critical in the longer-term.</p>\n</div>",

Now Ukraine throws sappers forward first in small groups of four or five, on foot, in the hope they go undetected; infantry then follows.

But the new small-group tactics are achieving modest results. A slow advance has inched Ukrainian positions near Robotyne towards their target of Tokmak to the south, an important rail hub that could put himars rocket-launchers within firing distance of the Russia-Crimea road link. Ukrainians are also applying new technological know-how. Drones equipped with heat sensors are the latest weapons.

That's less to do with UAF General Staff, in honesty it was largely despite them.\n\n- The April-May Kharkiv counteroffensive was really smart. They didn't need to commit many forces to do it, but they caught the Russians off guard who had something like ~7 BTGs spread out over 70 kilometers, pushed them back outside artillery range of Kharkiv, forcing the Russians to commit reserves to hold their operational supply lines and then more reserves to counterattack to try to push the Ukrainians back. Those extra units and supplies could have been used in the Donbas to more success.\n\n- When it became apparent their big plan for a grand summer offensive against the South, the highly telegraphed attacks against Kherson bridgehead and Zaporizhzhia both, wouldn't succeed they adopted on the fly and created the September Kharkiv counteroffensive as a fixing operation to take pressure off of the Kherson bridgehead main effort.

While there may be some discrepancy in the data, there is very little reason to believe that there would be a significant difference in the tallies  due to land lost/won. Ukraine is still to reclaim areas where Russia was attrited heavily and Russian losses would remain hidden (Donetsk oblast, including Mariupol, Pisky, Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut, etc.) Though, personally, just to be conservative, I\u2019ll give Ukraine the edge here in terms of their losses being more hidden only because of the Kharkiv/Luhansk offensive leading to a huge spike in Russian losses in equipment. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever Oryx is</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that\u2019s the crux of the matter. From our debate in September last year, you didn\u2019t believe Oryx was credible. Idk/Idc if that\u2019s at the root of this, but the numbers aren\u2019t favoring Ukraine because the Russians aren\u2019t filming losses or because Ukraine is finding more Russian losses to post on Telegram.</p>\n</div>",
