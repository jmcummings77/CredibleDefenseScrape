As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

            "body": "[Translated, **long**, opinion piece by Ukrainian Pravda:](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2023/04/24/7399113/)\n\n1/3:\n\n****\n\nSupporting the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF): Waiting for the counteroffensive. How the UAF is preparing for the de-occupation of territories and how the leak of Pentagon documents is affecting Ukraine's plans.\n\n\"Counteroffensive\" has been among the top topics in both Western and Ukrainian media since the end of last autumn.\n\nIt gained even more attention after an interview with the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, in \"The Economist,\" where he revealed what weapons the Ukrainian army would need to reach the front line on February 23, 2022.\n\nThroughout the winter and early spring, media and military analysts discussed the Russian offensive in Donbas, and later the future Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nVarious military experts appear on television screens, YouTube, and internet media pages every day, making predictions about when it will begin, drawing dozens of maps with arrows, and describing where and how the UAF will advance.\n\nRepresentatives of the military and political leadership emphasize that all of these conversations are nothing more than coffee table speculation.\n\nAccording to Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, information about when and where the UAF's counteroffensive will begin is known to no more than five people on the planet.\n\nGiven the above, \"Ukrainska Pravda\" will not speculate on how the Armed Forces of Ukraine will act. We will focus on how preparation for the counteroffensive is going, what weapons are needed to carry it out, and how recent leaks of Pentagon documents mentioning Ukraine affect the future actions of the Ukrainian army.\n\nDuring the preparation of the material, \"Ukrainska Pravda\" spoke with dozens of sources [called interlocutor in this text] in government bodies and among the military. The information gathered in this text in no way reveals Ukraine's plans for the offensive (they are unknown to \"Ukrainska Pravda\") and does not harm the Ukrainian army.\n\nPentagon document leaks and the prospects of the counteroffensive\nIn early February 2023, the top representatives of Ukraine's military and political leadership held several closed briefings for \"the big seven\" diplomats.\n\nObviously, the main topic of these conversations was the prospects and timing of the start of a large-scale Ukrainian counteroffensive operation.\n\nAccording to the interlocutors present at the diplomatic meetings who spoke with \"Ukrainska Pravda,\" after the words \"the beginning of the counteroffensive,\" the most frequent thing said was \"April-May.\" This time frame was considered by cautious Ukrainian speakers as the most likely for the start of large-scale actions on the front.\n\nAt the beginning of April, there were indeed significant events directly related to the Ukrainian army's counteroffensive. However, their epicenter was not in the east or south of Ukraine, but in the United States.\n\nOn gaming servers, classified Pentagon documents were leaked and made publicly available. Some of them were clearly forged, but according to most experts, some of them appear to be quite reliable.\n\nImmediately, the question arose as to whether there was a Moscow trail in this leak, as, for example, the figures for military losses were clearly fabricated in favor of Russia. Most of the military and political leadership in Kyiv leans towards this version.\n\nIn particular, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, said that it was a Kremlin information operation to damage relations between Ukraine and the United States.\n\nSome of the interviewed military experts from the Ukrainian establishment have a somewhat different view on the \"leak\". They argue that whoever stood behind this event, even if it was indeed a very expensive \"black swan\", the biggest beneficiary of it will be the United States: both Kiev and Moscow saw that Washington possesses a wide range of data on their forces.\n\nAnd most importantly, supposedly no side has a possibility of gaining a strategic advantage in these data. Thus, the US is supposedly sending a signal to both Russia and Ukraine that winning the war on the battlefield is currently out of reach for both sides.\n\nIn the end, whatever and whoever was behind the leak, the main question for Ukraine was whether this American negligence could jeopardise the counter-offensive that was being prepared. \n\nOfficially, through the words of the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, Kyiv stated that the leaked documents will have no influence on the preparation of a counteroffensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as the data, which was true, \"is no longer relevant.\"\n\nUnofficially, sources within the command of the Defense Forces also do not believe that the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been disrupted due to the American leak.\n\n\"This data leak will in no way affect our counteroffensive. Our real plans were not mentioned. We have plans, they have been approved by the General Staff, and we are moving forward step by step. The next couple of months will be difficult,\" warns one of the high-ranking Ukrainian military officials.\n\nHowever, in conversations with UP, the aforementioned \"average arithmetic\" was mentioned - referring to a forecast of when the counteroffensive will begin - which has shifted to May-June. But the reason for such changes is more likely due to nature and partners, rather than the leaked documents.\n\nOn the one hand, excessively wet weather with floods complicates military logistics and movement of heavy equipment. On the other hand, delays by partners in transferring weapons mean that a significant portion of this equipment is not yet in Ukraine.\n\n\"The curators of the counteroffensive\"\n\n\"The world loves winners. Understand that if we show success and the ability to win during the counteroffensive, this will be key in our partners' readiness to continue to help us in the future. Without victories, it will be very difficult to maintain support. So we need to win,\" explains one of the interlocutors of UP in the entourage of the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak.\n\nObviously, the success of military operations will determine the further course of events in many spheres, from Ukraine's very existence within its borders and its place in the geopolitical game to purely internal political developments.\n\nOne interesting non-public meeting that took place at the Bankova in early April may testify to how seriously Zelensky's team takes the need to win at all costs.\n\nMore than ten people were invited to the meeting with Yermak: several deputy heads of the Office of the President, heads of security agencies, top managers from state-owned banking and energy sectors, several ministers and deputies who demonstrated their effectiveness during the full-scale war.\n\nFor understandable security reasons, UP decided not to publish the names of those present, in order not to expose them to additional danger.\n\nDuring the meeting, the head of the OPU told those present that each of them has a personal important task from the president: Zelensky decided that these proven people should deal with the issue of equipping new brigades for the counteroffensive.\n\nAfter Yermak's brief report, his advisor Daria Zarivna distributed several sheets of paper with infographics about the needs of their brigades to each attendee.\n\nEssentially, in the Office of the President of Ukraine (OPU), they decided themselves who to entrust with which brigade. The participants of the meeting are responsible for quick staffing - whatever the brigades lack, the \"curator\" must find it. Regardless of how or where, the issues must be resolved.\n\n\"In fact, this is a good idea of Zelensky's. These are his people, and they can really quickly help the military. And the president also gets another direct communication channel with these brigades, so no soldier or official can report to Bankova that everything is fine when in reality there are real problems there. And you can't even imagine what a plus that is,\" explains one member of the president's team at OPU.\n\nAs OPU interlocutors convince, this approach to staffing brigades in no way indicates distrust of the military, but rather is intended to provide them with maximum help.\n\n\"Many officials and managers know exactly how to properly and quickly set up supply chains for what the brigades need here and now. You understand that very often it is about political ties inside the country and abroad. All this should speed up the equipment of fighters and get a parallel communication channel from ordinary soldiers,\" explains the OPU interlocutor at Bankova.\n\nWhat weapons does Ukraine need for an offensive?\n\nIn the aforementioned interview with \"The Economist\" in December 2022, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy outlined Ukraine's urgent needs: 300 tanks, about 700 infantry fighting vehicles, and half a thousand howitzers.\n\nAt that time, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov explained that the figures mentioned by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are the needs of the army for a specific operation, and much more equipment and weapons are needed for the complete de-occupation of Ukrainian territories.\n\nDuring the winter and early spring, Western partners actively worked on supplying weapons to Ukraine. Despite several breakthrough decisions regarding tanks and air defense systems, there remains a significant number of controversial issues and deficit positions.\n\nIn particular, regarding the supply of modern Western F-16 aircraft, ammunition, heavy weapons, and mortars.\n\nAs told by a interlocutor in the Armed Forces of Ukraine who is directly involved in the supply of weapons, one of the most problematic issues currently is also the quality of what is being provided to Ukraine.",

Their equipment is often also stored somewhere outdoors, and what looks impressive on paper is much more complicated in reality. This results in a weak supply speed,\" the interlocutor explains.\n\nHis words are confirmed by the top officials of the state in their public statements.\n\nOn March 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the Armed Forces of Ukraine cannot yet launch a counteroffensive, which was planned for the spring, due to a lack of weapons.\n\nA short list of what is most needed in the conditions of a counteroffensive:\nTo break the enemy's logistics lines and destroy the rear of the enemy, Ukraine needs long-range artillery, including Himars systems with long-range GLSDB shells (range of destruction - 150 km).\nThe Ukrainian army needs to disrupt the logistical branch of the occupiers that goes from the territory of Russia to the occupied Crimea. This will cut off the supply of the Russian grouping in Crimea, including their missile ships.\n\nFar-range artillery can also be used to destroy enemy air defense systems.\n\nTo destroy Russian air defense systems, Ukraine needs HARM anti-radiation missiles. They fly towards Russian radars, self-guide, and destroy them. The air defense system without radars becomes \"blind\". HARMs were developed for F-16 aircraft, but they can also be launched from Soviet MiGs. Additionally, the Himars installation mentioned earlier can also be used to destroy Russian air defense systems.\n\nTo destroy enemy aircraft and helicopters, Ukraine needs long-range air defense systems and a large number of missiles for them. This includes Patriot, NASAMS, IRIS-T. After suppressing Russian air defense systems, Ukraine will be able to use guided bombs such as JDAM (\"smart bombs\") more freely. They will help destroy depots, command posts, and armored vehicles. JDAM bombs are dropped from an aircraft, after which their wings open and they head towards the target.\n\nTo support infantry and destroy enemy fire points and fortifications, Ukraine needs tanks such as Abrams, Challenger, Leopard, etc. According to reports, the Ukrainian army will receive about a hundred Western tanks, which is not a lot. However, in addition to them, there are also Soviet and Polish PT-91 (a modernized Soviet T-72 tank). A significant amount of wheeled equipment such as \"Humvee\" is also needed for transporting infantry.\n\nThere is a lot of artillery, including NATO's 155 caliber. The Ukrainian army currently has the most M777 howitzers. According to rough estimates, Ukraine will receive about 500,000 shells for the offensive. If the active phase of the offensive lasts a month, the Ukrainian army will be able to fire approximately 20-25 thousand shells per day.\n\nCurrently, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are mainly on the defensive. To understand the needs of the army for an offensive, one can compare the use of shells by the enemy during the active phase of the offensive on Ukraine. From March to August 2022, the Russians fired approximately 50,000 shells per day.\n\nThe great \"Guardian of the Advance\" promotion, quiet preparation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and potential challenges of the operation.\n\nNew equipment and general conditions of the counter-offensive require a large number of well-trained personnel.\n\nFor the major offensive operation, Ukraine is preparing not just dozens but newly formed brigades of the Armed Forces and National Guard. At least 16 such brigades are known from public data (approximately 40-50 thousand people).\n\nThe most visible aspect, thanks to billboards, TV commercials, and bright slogans, is the recruitment process for the \"Guardian of the Advance\" - eight assault brigades in the composition of the National Guard. The ninth in this list is the \"Khartiya\" - the former Kharkiv DFTH in the composition of the 127th brigade of the Special Operations Forces.\n\nThe first thing to know about the \"Guardian of the Advance\" is that its advertising is not about creating new brigades from scratch, but rather reformatting and selecting people for already existing combat units.\n\nAnd this is, to some extent, good, because the core of the brigades includes units with already existing combat experience.\n\nFor example, the \"Rubizh\" brigade was created on the basis of the well-known 4th operational brigade, and the \"Bureviy\" brigade was created on the basis of the 1st presidential brigade. Both have gone through the toughest defensive operations in the East: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and Bakhmut.\n\n\"We thought that the 'Guardian of the Advance' was just an advertisement to recruit people to the National Guard. Because the military enlistment offices send them to the Armed Forces by the batch, and only 150 people came to the brigade \"N\" of the National Guard in a year. This doesn't even cover the \"200th\" and \"300th\" ones,\" recalls the commander of one of the reconnaissance units in the composition of the National Guard, who moved to \"Bureviy\" a couple of months ago, in conversation with Ukrainian News (UP).\n\nThe commander of one of the battalions of the same brigade, Kostiantyn Vakhramiiev, tells UP that his battalion (up to 700 people) is 80% made up of active military personnel and National Guard troops who have transferred from non-combat units. Only about 20% are recruits who came in response to the \"Guardian of the Advance\" advertising.\n\nEveryone who joins \"Bureviy\" undergoes a 45-day training. It covers the basics of military service, classes with instructors depending on the profession (machine gunner, grenadier, etc.).\n\nCombat medics, sappers, and sergeants are preparing abroad \u2013 in Poland, Great Britain, and Germany.\n\nThe distribution of 700 people in the battalion is roughly as follows: 400 people - assault infantry, 300 - artillerymen and support units.\n\n\"We emphasize assault infantry. After all, our task will be to go in and knock out the enemy, and then the Armed Forces of Ukraine should come in and secure the area. We have BTRs and mortars in our arsenal,\" explains the level of tasks of the battalion by Vakhramyeyev.\n\nThe aforementioned commander, who joined \"Bureviy\", assesses the current readiness of his unit at 75% in an interview with UP. They still have a month of training ahead of them.\n\n\"One of the shortcomings of the preparation is the lack of strategy. It is understandable that no one knows the counteroffensive plan. Don't tell me its date, don't tell me its location. But tell me, for example, what are we \"flying\" with - \"Maviks\", \"Storks\"? What are we using to listen to the Russians?\" - the commander shares his concerns.\n\nThe second thing to know about \"Guardian of the Advance\" is that some of its fighters are already at war. \"Bureviy\", for example, holds the front line in Luhansk region. That is, we are not talking about \"preserved\" brigades.\n\n\"There will be a task for counteroffensive - we will go on the offensive, but for now, we need to restrain the enemy in the east. And if we take all nine brigades and sit under Kyiv waiting for a counteroffensive, then who will be fighting?\" - Vakhramyeyev sums up.\n\nUnlike the \"Guardian of the Advance,\" the recruitment and training of new brigades in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which will receive Western tanks and long-range artillery, and therefore, are likely to be the main striking force of the offensive, are happening almost in complete silence.\n\nFrom open sources, it is known about the formation of the 47th separate assault brigade, which has Slovenian M-55S tanks, the 49th separate artillery brigade, which has Turkish TRG-230 MLRS (range 20-70 km). As well as several mechanized brigades, including the 21st, 33rd, and 118th.\n\nNew brigades are also being formed in the Marine Corps - the 37th and 38th. One of them is to be led by the former combat of the 1st separate marine battalion...\n\nFrom the available information, it appears that, unlike the \"Advance Guard,\" the new units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will be created from scratch. This raises questions about their level of combat readiness and coordination, although little is currently known about the preparation of these brigades.\n\nIt is quite possible that experienced AFU brigades will also participate in the upcoming operation. However, who they are and how many will be used in conjunction with the new brigades is currently unknown.\n\nOne experienced and authoritative military officer, speaking anonymously to the Ukrainian media, called the use of exclusively newly created AFU brigades in such an important operation as a counteroffensive a mistake. This is because most of these soldiers will only gain experience on the battlefield.\n\n\"It would have been better to bring out real combat units, complete them, give them new equipment, coordinate them, and make them a real striking force. It could have been effectively used in any direction. And what are we doing now? We're sending new units into the attack. Someone among them will definitely panic and drop their weapons. They're people, most of them taken from the streets,\" shares the officer.\n\n\"The main thing in war is combat experience. Newly formed units lack combat experience, as well as an officer core, even though a few people have been transferred there,\" he adds.",

Politics, especially in foreign affairs, are never simple. Unfortunately, it seems that Ukraine is refusing to acknowledge that their current tactic with Germany isn't working and instead, it is deteriorating the situation, which is likely to shrink public support.When Russia withdrew from the north, Germany moved on, but the government did not. Germany stepped up in arms deliveries and support. However, when they sent Marders, the media spent days trying to explain the differences between an IFV and a tank.

German media could have written less embellished headlines, but they didn't because they dislike Melnyk. They dislike him because of his tone-deaf attitude in regards to Germany.

And it didn't stop there. The German media basically exploded when the approval of tanks was announced, and then during Zelensky's mid-interview, he criticized the number and timing.

You mentioned trapping Wagnerites in Bakhmut. Now, inflicting casualties is great in a tactical sense, but in my view when it comes to a strategic or operational perspective, you want to achieve a bit more. Take the Kharkiv counter offensive for instance, yes they defeated the 1st guards tank army et al., but it more importantly secured Lyman and ensured that a pincer from it and Bakhmut could not encircle Sloviansk and Kramatorsk (a major war goal). \n\n\n\nIf you commit your veteran troops and fresh battalions with western equipment in an attempt to encircle Wagner et al. in Bakhmut, you may run into a few issues. First, this is the single densest concentration of RuAF anywhere, unlike Stalingrad where the actual objective of Army Group South was seizing the Caucasus with the city being a secondary objective. You may find that once you commence a pincer, the enemy will throw all their reserves at you with the single goal of evacuating their forces in the city and avoiding encirclement (a luxury that the 6th army did not have). It is a bit awkward if your strategy of trapping an enemy ends with you losing close-to irreplacable equipment and no trapped enemy.\n\n\n\n\nEven if the best case scenario occurs, Bakhmut is captured and all Wagnerites made into compost, we need to ask ourselves what we have achieved. Sure, there are now less Russian alligned men with rifles around, but if our goal is to eliminate all Russians with rifles at this rate, we will make the 30 years war seem like a short affair. We have reversed the meagre gains made during the RuAF winter offensive, which is certainly an emberrasment to them, but hardly a manouvre which will actually bring war closer to ending within the next decade.\n\n\n\nUnlike the Russian MoD, we actually want to win the war so we will have to engage in deep operational battle with \"Uranus\" towards the likes of Popasna and Svitlodarsk from Bakhmut. If this is the goal, maybe, just maybe, going through the teeth of the Russian defenses is not the wisest idea compared to finding a weaker spot, rather than the one place that is most likely to have our deep offensive break down.\n\n\n\nBut again, this is all un-credible rambling.  The UAF may or may not decide to launch a limited or full offensive in the Bakhmut axis. I do not possess the knowledge to say whether it is a wise or unwise decision. Time will tell.",

However, the chance of China attempting a takeover of Taiwan in the near future while this war is still going has increased slightly.\n\n**Explanation 1:** there is no organized political opposition in Russia.  There wasn't 6 months ago, there wasn't 12 months ago, there isn't any now.  As such, while (in my opinion) certain groups within the military/political heirarchy are getting more pessimistic, there is no realistic avenue for a coup/civil war at present.  \n\nHowever, this is the short term.  In the long term, Putin's political credibility and legacy does rest squarely on this war actually accomplishing anything.  Economic and military damage to Russia is increasing and sooner or later Putin needs to be able to make decisive progress.  And yet, for most of this war Putin's decision making seemed to be very shortsighted, basically \"kicking the can down the road\".  6 months ago in november, we were still awaiting the results of the heavily delayed Russian mobilization, which a lot of people were expecting to signal Putin actually starting to make difficult decisions in order to change the long-term prognosis of the war.  \n\nHowever, now it's become clear that ultimately Putin is still basically treading water/playing for time.  In november we saw 3 avenues Russia would pursue to try and break the stalemate - economic warfare via natural gas with western europe, infrastructure attacks against Ukraine, and a post-mobilization Russian offensive, all of which have at this point failed.  Now Putin's next big \"out\" is hoping [Russian political assets inside America start doing their jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12sw9dz/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_20_2023/jh28zho/), which is still a year away.  So 6 months later Putin's time-wise **further** from a potential endsieg than he is now.  This has lowered my personal prognosis for the Putin regime's long term political credibility.\n\n**Explanation 2**: Objectively speaking, there is **no** chance of a loss of Crimea until Ukraine recaptures most of the Azov coast, which is still far from guaranteed.  Subjectivity begins when we start to discuss whether Ukraine has a chance of forcing Russia out of Crimea should they take the Azov coast.  In my opinion they'll be able to mount increased pressure that in the long term jeopardizes Russia's stake on Crimea, but that's no longer objective.\n\nSo Ukraine's chance of retaking Crimea is directly related to their chance of retaking the Azov coast, which seems about steady now compared to Nov 2022.  This explanation's pretty short because this ultimately ties into the discussion of the potential 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive that you can find **literally everywhere** in this sub.\n\n**Explanation 3**: NATO is still holding 100% steady in their commitment to stay out of a shooting war, and if anything they have 15 months of success in doing so to point to.  At this point, it feels like if Putin was able/willing to force the Belarussian army to enter the war directly he would have done so, and similarly Ukraine has indicated no desire to attack Belarus themselves, and have been doing pretty great at keeping to that.\n\nSo that's the answer to this question, however personally I do feel that it is possible that China may attempt in the near future to seek a decisive takeover of Taiwan (however, likely no sooner than 6 months from now), while US political and military capital is partially invested in resolving the Ukraine war.  There are some signs of increased aggression.  This is a controversial and also very well discussed topic.  Even pro-Beijing posters on here disagree significantly on China's Taiwan timeline (you'll hear some saying China's ready to takeover today, others say China will literally never attempt a military solution).

My point is that Russia can shape any outcome to its general public anyway it wants: do a 180\u00b0 turns on its starting goals and Putin can still come out unscathed. \n\n>I'm not going to sugarcoat it, your understanding of authoritarian regimes is severely juvenile. This isn't a videogame where you press the authoritarian button and the political capital mechanic gets turned off, virtually all governments have political capital.\n\nThat's okay. But from where I'm standing, I can hold up the same mirror and state the exact same thing, you have the same, severe juvenile understanding of the power of propaganda coupled with oppression and how it shapes the mind and the actions, or better said, inactions, of the general public. You're putting too much weight to Putin's political credibility. And you don't clarify from which perspective that political credibility should be seen, so it remains vague and opaque throughout your rebuttal.\n\nBut I gave it a try: from the point of view from the current Western political leaders and parties, sure, that monster has zero credibility any more, or better said, shouldn't have any, but politicians' ~~opinions~~ pockets are quickly filled through bribery or their opinions swayed by whatever narrative suits the current national political climate the best. But for the moment, let's indeed agree and say he has little left in regards to political credibility in the eye of the general Western public and the Western political landscape. And his legacy should and will be forever tarnished for the genocide he committed in Ukraine and he will go down the history books with blood of hundreds of thousands of lives on his hands.\n\nBut, and a fat big **but**, from the point of view of the ordinary Russian citizen, the Russian masses, which should be the only metric when viewing political credibility in light of Putin's survival, Putin can get away with much more than you claim he can, due to the influence of the general public's daily dose of bullshit nationalistic propaganda, the oppression of opposition and quailing of voicing opposing, dissident opinions. Propaganda and fear are a regimes primary tools to control the masses. This has been the way throughout history and it's rife with examples inside Russian history and outside. Internal political credibility....not so much. External, debatable.\n\nAnd I don't have to look far for the bubble effect of lobsided news outlets that shape people's political opinions. People tend to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and attitudes, while avoiding information that challenges them. This is known as selective exposure, and it reinforces the information bubble effect. We all tend to fall victim to that, especially when arguing on Reddit like we do now. Online platforms use algorithms to personalize content for users based on their past behavior and preferences. This create a filter bubble where people only see content that aligns with their existing views and opinions, further reinforcing their information bubble. Social media creates echo chambers where people are exposed only to content that their friends and followers share, which creates a reinforcing feedback loop of shared beliefs and attitudes. Now change lobsided nees for propaganda and you get where Eussia is today.  Even at the end of WW2, Hitler's rule was not challenged by the German population. This is one of many prime examples of the power of propaganda.\n\nAnd the above example of what information bubble can cause in a free, Western country, where my not so dumb, backyard neighbours, and a significant part of the voting population, vote for nationalistic parties that falsely paint immigration as the source of most of a country's current issues.\n\nNow the same applies to Russia, but try to imagine a country with the political culture of strongmen leaders throughout most of its history, a state controlled media landscape and oppression of opposing voices. Sure, there is a Russian minority capable and smart enough to be motivated of getting access to different media outside of Russia, but it is still a minority and a large part has already escaped the Russian oppressive regime by simply getting out of Russia.\n\nPropaganda and oppression is the reason why Putin get away with this horrendous, idiotic war and, God forbid, future atrocities.\n\nThe only quick end to this war is his death and pray for the best in regards to his successor or beefed up Western, military support, but the reluctance in that regards is just too painful to watch.\n\nHoping for change through the loss of political credibility and legacy, is wishful thinking, to put it mildly. If you might somehow be right, the most likely outcome possible is a freeze after whatever territory Ukraine can liberate.\n\nEdit: hit enter too soon.\n\nEdit 2: way too soon. But done now.\n\nEdit 3....typos, my bad.",

And his legacy should and will be forever tarnished for the genocide he committed in Ukraine and he will go down the history books with blood of hundreds of thousands of lives on his hands.</p>\n\n<p>But, and a fat big <strong>but</strong>, from the point of view of the ordinary Russian citizen, the Russian masses, which should be the only metric when viewing political credibility in light of Putin&#39;s survival, Putin can get away with much more than you claim he can, due to the influence of the general public&#39;s daily dose of bullshit nationalistic propaganda, the oppression of opposition and quailing of voicing opposing, dissident opinions. Propaganda and fear are a regimes primary tools to control the masses. This has been the way throughout history and it&#39;s rife with examples inside Russian history and outside. Internal political credibility....not so much. External, debatable.</p>\n\n<p>And I don&#39;t have to look far for the bubble effect of lobsided news outlets that shape people&#39;s political opinions. People tend to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and attitudes, while avoiding information that challenges them. This is known as selective exposure, and it reinforces the information bubble effect. We all tend to fall victim to that, especially when arguing on Reddit like we do now. Online platforms use algorithms to personalize content for users based on their past behavior and preferences. This create a filter bubble where people only see content that aligns with their existing views and opinions, further reinforcing their information bubble. Social media creates echo chambers where people are exposed only to content that their friends and followers share, which creates a reinforcing feedback loop of shared beliefs and attitudes. Now change lobsided nees for propaganda and you get where Eussia is today.  Even at the end of WW2, Hitler&#39;s rule was not challenged by the German population. This is one of many prime examples of the power of propaganda.</p>\n\n<p>And the above example of what information bubble can cause in a free, Western country, where my not so dumb, backyard neighbours, and a significant part of the voting population, vote for nationalistic parties that falsely paint immigration as the source of most of a country&#39;s current issues.</p>\n\n<p>Now the same applies to Russia, but try to imagine a country with the political culture of strongmen leaders throughout most of its history, a state controlled media landscape and oppression of opposing voices. Sure, there is a Russian minority capable and smart enough to be motivated of getting access to different media outside of Russia, but it is still a minority and a large part has already escaped the Russian oppressive regime by simply getting out of Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Propaganda and oppression is the reason why Putin get away with this horrendous, idiotic war and, God forbid, future atrocities.</p>\n\n<p>The only quick end to this war is his death and pray for the best in regards to his successor or beefed up Western, military support, but the reluctance in that regards is just too painful to watch.</p>\n\n<p>Hoping for change through the loss of political credibility and legacy, is wishful thinking, to put it mildly. If you might somehow be right, the most likely outcome possible is a freeze after whatever territory Ukraine can liberate.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: hit enter too soon.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: way too soon. But done now.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3....typos, my bad.</p>\n</div>",

Like others in this report, he spoke on condition that he only be identified by his rank and call sign \u201cBandit\u201d in keeping with military protocol.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know, to be honest, what will happen in a week or two,\u201d Bandit said. \u201cA lot of people are dying here, a lot.\u201d\n\nFor months, Ukraine and Russia have flooded Bakhmut with reinforcements and carted away thousands of dead and wounded in what has become the longest, bloodiest battle of the war. Now, after eight months of Ukraine steadily ceding territory, the fight is closing in on just a few square miles of the city\u2019s west.\n\nAs the vise tightens \u2014 with Russians assaulting from the north, east and south \u2014 Kyiv is determined to draw the fight out as long as possible, hoping to deplete its enemy ahead of what is expected to be a high-stakes offensive aimed at dislodging Russian forces from a large swath of occupied territory.\n\nIn an effort to speed up its advance, Russia has begun destroying entire apartment blocks used by Ukraine as defensive positions. The city is flattened in many places and most of its prewar population of about 70,000 have fled.\n\n\u201cThey are simply blowing up nine-story buildings,\u201d Bandit said. A powerful aerial bomb, he said, \u201cwas dropped on the four-story buildings next to ours \u2014 there was nothing left of it. If it had landed on our building, we wouldn\u2019t be here either.\u201d\n\nUkraine defended Bakhmut despite U.S. warnings in leaked documents\n\nRussian advances have also closed in on Ukraine\u2019s supply roads to western Bakhmut. Moscow claimed to have taken control of a few hundred yards of one road on Friday, but Ukraine says it still can ferry soldiers and supplies in and out as needed.\n\nThe current front line in the west runs south of the main train station that Ukraine has been using as high ground, but Russian forces have pushed past the railroad tracks to the northwest and southwest edges.\n\nThe Wagner mercenary group has largely led Russia\u2019s fight for Bakhmut and its leader, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, has repeatedly claimed his forces were on the verge of taking the city. Prigozhin personally broadcast videos marking Wagner advances after pushing into city center, including one in which his fighters placing a flag on a World War II liberation monument and another from the city\u2019s main administration building last month.\n\nSince the video from the administration building was released earlier this month, Russian forces have advanced less than a mile farther into the city center.\n\nA damp basement on the city\u2019s edge has been transformed into a Ukrainian command center. Computer screens and a tablet set up on a simple table toggled between half a dozen drone feeds showing Russian positions about three miles away.\n\nA lieutenant with the call sign \u201cPlai\u201d tracked a small Russian infantry unit moving across a courtyard between buildings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for movement, any kind of movement,\u201d he said as the feed zoomed in on a shattered building and coordinates were radioed to a nearby howitzer.\n\nThe wider shots showed dozens of homes shredded by months of artillery fire. \u201cThe whole city looks like this,\u201d Plai said. He said he blames Russia for the majority of the destruction, but also accepts Ukraine has played a role given that both sides have relied on heavy artillery since the battle began.\n\n\u201cWe feel responsible, but we also understand that we will be rebuilding Bakhmut after this is over,\u201d he said.\n\nRussians in turn believe that they will be the ones to reconstruct Bakhmut, which they call Artyomovsk, its Soviet-Russian name, just as they are now rebuilding occupied Mariupol, a port city in Donetsk that was largely destroyed during a Russian siege last spring.\n\nIn the Ukrainians\u2019 basement command center, one drone feed flashed a warning \u201cGPS signal weak,\u201d then \u201caircraft signal interference\u201d before the image began to spin. \u201cIt\u2019s falling,\u201d Plai said as the screen became garbled and then went dark. \u201cIt got too close to the jammers.\u201d\n\nPlai said the fight for Bakhmut has intensified over the past week, as Russia and Ukraine each sent reinforcements into the city and are suffering more casualties. Both sides have deployed elite units to Bakhmut at various points to strengthen ground operations and reconnaissance.\n\nIncreased reconnaissance focusing on a smaller patch of territory in Bakhmut has forced Russian and Ukrainian troops to be more mobile. After launching an attack from one position, ground units typically need to move quickly before drones overhead are able to call in artillery.\n\n\u201cThere can be an immediate response if the enemy drones see where a shot came from,\u201d said Bandit, the junior sergeant. \u201cWe come, we work there and we leave. No one waits in the same place for a response. The crew can die if they sit at one point for too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe battles are tougher now,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting, it\u2019s hard to even think afterward.\u201d",

You didn&#39;t need to expose the helicopter with Hellfire like you did with TOW or still do with every Soviet/Russian heliborne missile except LMUR- you could hit targets marked by ground designators or an OH-58D&#39;s mast-mounted sight, even if the Apache was on the other side of a hill or treeline.</p>\n\n<p>NLOS Spike on Apache is just a more effective iteration of that concept.</p>\n</div>",
