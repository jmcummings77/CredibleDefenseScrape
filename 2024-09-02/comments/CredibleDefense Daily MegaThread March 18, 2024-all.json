Two estimates on refinery throughput reduction caused by Ukrainian strikes:\n\n>[Gunvor Says Drones Shut 600,000 Barrels of Russian Refining](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/gunvor-says-drones-shut-down-600-000-barrels-of-russia-refining) \n\n> Gunvor Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist estimates about 600,000 barrels of Russia\u2019s daily oil-refining capacity has been knocked out by Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\n>Weekend drone strikes hit multiple plants in Russia, some deep inside its borders, sending diesel futures higher for a fourth straight session while gasoline futures climbed for a sixth.\n\n>\u201cIt is significant because obviously this is gonna hit the distillate exports straight away,\u201d T\u00f6rnqvist said during an interview at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference in Houston on Monday. \u201cSo that will probably take down exports by a couple of hundred thousand barrels, so to me it\u2019s a distillate problem.\u201d\n\nBrief context here on Gunvor for the uninitiated: Gunvor was co-owned by the oligarch and close Putin associate Timchenko, until he sold his stake to T\u00f6rnqvist the day before sanctions were placed on him back in 2014 (digression, but the FT had good reporting back then on the timing of that transaction, along with many others.) Gunvor was also considered to be an investment vehicle for Putin [personally](http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-money-laundering-probe-touches-putins-inner-circle-1415234261), while the firm was probably the largest independent trader of Russian O&G. Timchenko, for his part, is one of the largest shareholders in Novatek (operator/owner of the Ust-Luga terminal that was attacked in January,) and possibly the money man behind the brutal Redut PMC, which has taken on a new importance in the post-Wagner era. Anyway, long tangent to say that that estimate is a good floor. \n\nSubsequently, [JPM](https://ibb.co/6ZLRrcf) put out a more up-to-date report saying refinery capacity had been cut by **900kbpd**, or ~16% of total utilization last month. Again, one very important caveat on this fraction, which many are quoting: not all refineries are created the same, and refined products are *not* fungible. In other words, some of these refineries have more middle distillate production than others, so they produce more diesel than other refineries that have been unmolested. Some may produce more gasoline, etc. Lukoil\u2019s Nizhny Novgorod (Norsi), for example, produces 60kbpd of diesel/gasoil, which is far more than other larger refineries. The point is that Russia actually does not produce a lot of excess high value refined products that it exports (relative to its absolute volumes,) and the global market for these products is tight. Every single refinery that had been attacked till last week did supply export terminals, which may or may not be a coincidence. As a reminder, this is not a commentary on future attacks. \n\nLastly, in crude flows. This topic deserves a much lengthier post detailing some genuinely interesting events going back to November when the U.S. started directly sanctioning vessels, with multiple ships executing [u-turns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-09/russian-oil-tanker-u-turns-hours-after-being-hit-by-us-sanctions) immediately after being sanctioned, Indian refiners [refusing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/russia-s-oil-exports-are-at-risk-with-india-shunning-key-grade) Sokol crude, and even the ever intransigent [Novak](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-31/oil-sanctions-are-deepening-russian-crude-discounts-novak-says) admitting to steepening discounts on Russian crude, but this one story will have to suffice for now:\n\n\n>[Russian Oil Squeeze Tightens as Sovcomflot Admits Difficulties](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/russian-oil-squeeze-tightens-as-sovcomflot-admits-difficulties)\n\n>* New sanctions \u2018creating additional operational difficulties\u2019\n>* Increased wariness about dealings with sanctioned oil tankers\n\n>Russia\u2019s state oil tanker company PJSC Sovcomflot said that US sanctions are putting pressure on its operations, the latest sign that the measures are complicating the delivery of the nation\u2019s petroleum.\n\n>Most of the individually sanctioned tankers since October all but halted trading or faced notable disruption after the measures were imposed.

It was in this channel that in January the video of the complaint by former Wagnerites who joined the 331st Airborne Regiment of the 98th VDV Division was published (it was later also published by Romanov and [translated](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1748141913549549875) by Dmtri from WarTranslated), in which the soldiers spoke about the fact they had seized drugs and had come into conflict with the traffic police of the occupied Luhansk Oblast, who were supplying narcotics to Russian soldiers - they allegedly did this because they said that many servicemen died in action under the influence of drugs. In general, drug dealing at the front is a quite common thing, and not only on the Russian side: there are drug dealing rings in certain Ukrainian brigades as well. These are normal things when an army has hundreds of thousands of men from any social background, but what matters is the response of the military authorities to this.\n\nOver the past weeks, several videos have been released about the mistreatment of soldiers by the officers.\n\nIn early March, a mobilized serviceman of the 30th Motorized Brigade (2nd Army of the Central MD, active in the Stepove/Berdychi area) reported in a video that he was an eyewitness to some regrettable incidents. Two soldiers were allegedly hit in the legs by the battalion commander (call sign \"Sarmat\") because they refused to attack. In another case, five soldiers were eliminated at once, guilty of abandoning their main group or retreating. It\u2019s said that these were not isolated cases; he and several fellow soldiers abandoned the unit and contacted the military police to report that, being initially promised help with the transfer to another unit. Subsequently, he was arrested and tortured by waterboarding to force him to change his testimony. During the torture he was reportedly injured in a leg and a few days later eventually sent to another unit. It\u2019s also reported of cases in which wounded (Russian) servicemen were killed on the spot by commanders. https://t. me/poisk_in_ua/49053\n\nLast Saturday, another video came out in which the former commander of the Storm (assault) company (Konstantin Mykhanik) of the \"Sarmat\" Battalion (that would be the commander of this battalion) of the 30th Motorized Brigade, in addition to saying that his company went into battle with 114 people and returned with 20, reported a very serious crime. The unit commanders allegedly had a criminal plan to kill soldiers returning from hospitals (meaning they had also just received a payment of 3 million rubles as compensation), steal their personal belongings and credit cards, and pocket the money. The slain soldiers were buried in a forest. After 14 servicemen escaped from the unit, those bodies were dug up and taken to an unknown location. There was an order to eliminate inconvenient witnesses on the first line to make them look like fallen in action. These 5 fighters who are in the video learnt that they would be eliminated shortly after and decided to flee to the rear to expose the illegalities taking place in the battalion. Also in this battalion, blocking detachments are used, with orders to shoot any soldier retreating from the assault mission. Within the battalion people were easily killed for anything: for any slightest provocation, for complaining or drinking. https://t. me/poisk_in_ua/51236\n\nThese seem to me to be very serious facts and I find very difficult for the Russian command to ignore or downplay them. I will now list some other incidents, less serious but still interesting. \n\nOne thing that seems to happen relatively frequently is reports of bad treatment of Tuvans, with requests by them to be sent elsewhere (usually to the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army of the Central MD, which is largely staffed by Tuvans, including the officers). A video came out this week in which a soldier from the 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps complained that his commanders don\u2019t offer any rest after missions, not even giving him a chance to wash up once he returns, and use violence against subordinates. This fighter was reportedly kept caged in a basement for a day and sent back to the front line the next day. In the video, he asks for help from authorities of Tuva Republic to arrange the transfer to another unit. https://t. me/poisk_in_ua/50767\n\nIn this video in January, a mobilized serviceman in the 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps complained that out of 20 fellow Tuvans in the unit there were 5 left, the commanders don\u2019t allow rest and threaten him and his comrades-in-arms with execution, as well as being frequently insulted and humiliated by commanders and having had his papers confiscated. https://t. me/poisk_in_ua/42692\n\nThe same thing had also happened in February 2023. Mobilized men from Tuva applied, successfully, to the authorities of their republic in order to be transferred from the units of the 1st Corps (former DPR Army), where they were abused, to the 55th Mountain Brigade. https://t. me/horizontal_russia/19389\n\nAnother pair of videos released this week concerns two different groups of soldiers from the 6th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD. The first group claimed that they were transferred in January 2024 (i.e. presumably as soon as they arrived in Avdiivka) to the former PMC \"Veterans\", now an Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade (they are those who conquered the \"Tsarska Ohota\" by passing inside the famous pipe). During this time they were without support and had to get food and water on their own. Russian sources also wrote a few weeks ago of how the 1487th Regiment of the Territorial Forces was subordinated to the \"Veterans\" in January, during the battles in the southern flank of the city, suffering very huge losses. On February 19 they returned to the 6th Tank Regiment, where they discovered that they were officially marked as members of the \"Veterans\", and in the ensuing confusion they didn\u2019t receive combat pay and awards, and the wounded didn\u2019t have adequate support. On March 6 their unit was sent to the 10th Tank Regiment (now part of the 20th Motorized Division, 8th Army of the Southern MD) and very soon after to the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps. Here they were given machine guns and were loaded into Kamaz trucks, told they were going to a training camp, except being sent to the front lines, instead. They did not even know who their new commander was and their request to know that was ignored. So they returned to the base of the 6th Tank Regiment, but they still cannot find out which unit they belong to, what is their current specialty and who their commanders are. Some of the soldiers among those in the video have not received payment and others are even listed as MIAs. https://t. me/poisk_in_ua/50930\n\nThe second group complained of the same problem regarding the payment of salaries and bonuses after the undocumented transfer to the \"Veterans\u201d. They, too, were later sent to the 114th Motorized Brigade, complaining that in this brigade they were treated like beasts: they were sent at night to the area of the Coke Plant, where they were ordered to go on assault with an assault rifle and four magazines. The brigade command is defined as being incompetent and ignorant about the situation. The assaults are called suicidal, and of two companies of 220 people, the majority are wounded and about 75 remain in them. Some of the soldiers in the video have had their documents and personal belongings stolen and have had to buy back what they need with their own money. https://t. me/poisk_in_ua/50931",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The number of <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/EwuR2db.png\">identified Russian losses</a> remains at historically very high values, a sign that what I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b5gmzq/comment/kt6zf4y/\">had written</a> about two weeks ago was not a backlogs-driven number but a serious upward trend, exacerbated by the arrival of obituaries of the fallen during the very bloody final part of the battle of Avdiivka (note that they have stopped counting in a separate category the low number of Wagnerites who are still discovered as KIA nowadays and the number is now integrated among the regular KIAs).</p>\n\n<p>That said, this Telegram channel (\u201cPoisk_in_UA\u201d) is also very useful as it brings to light the <em>cahiers de dol\u00e9ances</em> by Russian soldiers as well as video complaints about wrongful acts that are going on.

As far as I read on the \"Motopatriot\" channel (who was a friend of Sasha), from a message later deleted due to pressure from GRU as far as written (but I had saved the screenshot of the chat so I could translate it on Google Translate), in September 2022 both the brigade commander and the commander of Sasha\u2019s battalion were replaced, guilty in his words of going against the \"system\u201d.

One of Group-13's targets was the Sergey Kotov patrol ship, successfully sunk on March 5th, 2024. The operation piqued the interest of journalists from the [Ukrainian office of BBC](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/articles/c3ge8evj2xqo).*\n\n*Commander of Group-13, a serviceman with a call sign \"Thirteenth,\" told the reporters that Sergey Kotov was so far the toughest target to defeat, out of five ships this unit had engaged. The patrol ship was attacked repeatedly two times but only on the third one did Ukrainian drones manage to destroy it. Side note, earlier the elite unit commander revealed that a total of ten Magura V5 drones were engaged for the operation, it took six of them to sink the Russian warship.*\n\n*Magura V5 is Group-13's exclusive weapon made by an undisclosed Ukrainian company, one of the three unmanned surface vessels of domestic manufacture in service with the Ukrainian Defense Forces. Each one has its own features and roles, and \"Thirteenth\" specified some of the unique specs of Magura V5 to the BBC journalists:*\n\n*\"It doesn't emit much heat, so it's almost not visible to thermal imaging cameras. It is made of plastic, so even radars have a hard time seeing it,\" he said.*\n\n*Moreover, according to the drone unit commander, the operational range of Magura V5 is 800 km, and payload capacity is 250 kg \u2014 contrary to the previously known data about this unmanned system, suggesting it can carry 320 kg of load. The figures come from a presentation from the Ukrainian government's defense export agency SpetsTechnoExport:*\n\n*These 250 kilograms of explosive are enough to sink a warship, \"Thirteenth\" assures. Control of the uncrewed vessel is secured via internet connection, so the operator could be anywhere, their location is not tied to a specific link range. Defense Express adds that earlier such drones were seen with Starlink antennas providing network connection through satellites. There are also a backup control channels in addition to the main one, the commander said without any further details.*\n\n*Also, the hull length has increased, compared to the previously known information \u2013 current 6 meters vs. 5.5 meters known earlier. While the cost for a Magura drone remains undisclosed, \"Thirteenth\" mentioned that all of those produced since early 2023 combined would still be cheaper than the Ivanovets missile corvette of the Russian Black Sea Fleet which was sunk by the very same drones in early February 2024. Defense Intelligence estimates the cost of this battleship at $60\u201370 million, however, the exact number of Magura drones produced is not disclosed.*\n\n[D-80 Discovery & E-300 Enterprise UAVs: Platforms for Carrying Equipment, Weapons, & Defeating Enemies | Defense Express | March 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/events/d_80_discovery_and_e_300_enterprise_uavs_platforms_for_carrying_equipment_weapons_and_defeating_enemies-9859.html)\n\nThis was announced by the main investor of the AeroDrone project, Dmytro Shymkiv, in an interview with [Ekonomichna Pravda](https://www.epravda.com.ua/publications/2024/03/13/711076/), Censor.NET reports.\n\nAs noted, AeroDrone was once an inconspicuous manufacturer of agricultural aircraft that were not in demand either in Ukraine or abroad. The times have forced the company to switch to the military. Today, the company manufactures D-80 Discovery and E-300 Enterprise drones. Their feature is a large payload capacity, which allows them to carry cargo and mount sophisticated equipment and weapons.\n\n*\"Discovery has a payload capacity of 80 kilograms, Enterprise - 300 kilograms. These are the second class of drones. They are designed for reconnaissance, delivery of cargo to the frontline and can be a platform for carrying sophisticated equipment, weapons and defeating the enemy. The price mentioned (up to $450,000 - Ed.) is the cost of a set of two D-80s with expensive cameras and communication systems,\" Shymkiv said.*\n\n*He also explained how their projects differ from the much cheaper Leleka-100 or Shark reconnaissance vehicles.*\n\n*\"They occupy a completely different niche. Firstly, one of the aircraft can stay in the air for up to 23 hours. Secondly, they can carry a set of heavy radio equipment for reconnaissance. Recently, we demonstrated to the military how our aircraft can carry reconnaissance equipment that is not even available in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.*\n\n*Thirdly, the E-300 has better stability. Thanks to this, we were able to achieve a 40x zoom on one of the mid-range cameras,\" says Shymkiv.*\n\n*Shymkiv also clarified that the E-300 Enterprise is a platform that can be used to install various equipment, including equipment that no one has ever thought of installing on a UAV before.*\n\n*Answering a question about the number of aircraft produced, Shymkiv said: \"We are talking about units per month. These are full-fledged aircraft, and we are tested according to aviation standards.\"*",

Defense Intelligence estimates the cost of this battleship at $60\u201370 million, however, the exact number of Magura drones produced is not disclosed.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/events/d_80_discovery_and_e_300_enterprise_uavs_platforms_for_carrying_equipment_weapons_and_defeating_enemies-9859.html\">D-80 Discovery &amp; E-300 Enterprise UAVs: Platforms for Carrying Equipment, Weapons, &amp; Defeating Enemies | Defense Express | March 2024</a></p>\n\n<p>This was announced by the main investor of the AeroDrone project, Dmytro Shymkiv, in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.epravda.com.ua/publications/2024/03/13/711076/\">Ekonomichna Pravda</a>, Censor.NET reports.</p>\n\n<p>As noted, AeroDrone was once an inconspicuous manufacturer of agricultural aircraft that were not in demand either in Ukraine or abroad. The times have forced the company to switch to the military. Today, the company manufactures D-80 Discovery and E-300 Enterprise drones. Their feature is a large payload capacity, which allows them to carry cargo and mount sophisticated equipment and weapons.</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Discovery has a payload capacity of 80 kilograms, Enterprise - 300 kilograms. These are the second class of drones. They are designed for reconnaissance, delivery of cargo to the frontline and can be a platform for carrying sophisticated equipment, weapons and defeating the enemy. The price mentioned (up to $450,000 - Ed.) is the cost of a set of two D-80s with expensive cameras and communication systems,&quot; Shymkiv said.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>He also explained how their projects differ from the much cheaper Leleka-100 or Shark reconnaissance vehicles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;They occupy a completely different niche. Firstly, one of the aircraft can stay in the air for up to 23 hours. Secondly, they can carry a set of heavy radio equipment for reconnaissance. Recently, we demonstrated to the military how our aircraft can carry reconnaissance equipment that is not even available in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Thirdly, the E-300 has better stability. Thanks to this, we were able to achieve a 40x zoom on one of the mid-range cameras,&quot; says Shymkiv.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Shymkiv also clarified that the E-300 Enterprise is a platform that can be used to install various equipment, including equipment that no one has ever thought of installing on a UAV before.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Answering a question about the number of aircraft produced, Shymkiv said: &quot;We are talking about units per month. These are full-fledged aircraft, and we are tested according to aviation standards.&quot;</em></p>\n</div>",

He notes that Russia has evaluated the current production capabilities of Ukraine and its allies and is using its advantage in ammunition to maintain the intensity of fire. Since the start of 2024, the advantage in artillery fire along the front line has been 7:1 in favor of the Russian forces.*\n\n*The Deputy Defense Minister also mentions that Russian combat aviation dominates the sky, with Russian fighters actively using guided aerial bombs against Ukrainian positions.

That is why I focus on modern weapons that are more powerful, more accurate than Russian models, and therefore more effective.

The Ukrainian army is working towards stabilising the front, and it's too early to say, but it's trending towards stabilisation, at least until the next major Russian offensive\" (a bit of my paraphrasing. And the language of trending towards is both very guarded and very familiar for me, personally, when I have to write about results with P > 0.05).\n\n- manpower and ammunition issues. (Interview with Arestovych: https://unherd.com/2024/01/oleksiy-arestovych-zelenskyys-challenger/)\n\n>When I was in office, I heard them say that four and a half million men, around half of the whole fighting age male population of Ukraine, had avoided registering at the recruitment centre, not for recruitment purposes but to check their personal data. \n\n- Strike-capable drones are a supplement and a crutch when one lacks conventional capabilities, but not a replacement. Very thin competitive edge between drones and EW. \n\n- Relatively effective gun-based anti-drone defence using mobile gun-based AA units coupled with a Ukraine-wide sensor network. Intercepts about 40% of the Shaheds and cruise missiles. Needs things like tablets and thermal scopes. Kofman didn't stated it but in a Jack Walting's book talk, this sensor network included acoustic sensors, aka microphones, that pick up the noise signatures of drones and missiles and with that, predicts the flight paths and likely targets and shifts the mobile AA gun units around. Acoustic and IR sensors can be reconfigured and reprogrammed to better detect and engage drones without being an emitter.\n\n- both sides have problems scaling up offensives beyond platoon-company levels but Russia has an edge in having larger enabler and support units. For example, Ukraine is having issues with building second and third lines of defence. There are plans, yes, but the lines need to be built. Why? Ukrainian military engineers organic to brigades are focused on digging the first line while the Russian Army has engineer brigades that can handle this. Ukraine has no shortage of construction contractors or equipments that can be contracted to building those lines, but they need to be contracted. (And it's not like building military fortification is something any contractor would know how to do. They need to select the positions, identify likely enemy avenues of approaches, and integrate eith mutually supporting positions, direct and indirect fire and movement plans, etc ...). UA trimmed a lot of commanding formations and echelons while RUA kept division- and Combined Arms Army-levels of command and thus, they kept, e.g. Engineer brigades.\n\n- reports of summary executions by the Russians as a method to keep discipline and force men to go forward. \"Wagerisation\" of the Russian Army. Tactics that once were associated with Wagner are now sort of the norms. Intercepted calls showed mothers and wives of the \"volunteers\" telling the men to \"volunteer\" for the storm units because \"it's a lot of money\". More if they die. Very functional relationships right there /s. \n\nhttps://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/11/24/7430208/\n\n>Ukraine's Ministries of Defence and Digital Transformation have established an interagency working group to build military engineering and fortification structures with involvement from businesses that are prepared to sponsor the construction of two to three lines.\n\nUkraine's Ministries of Defence and Digital Transformation becomes the ministry with spare manpower and capacity to be asked to do various things.",

(Interview with Arestovych: <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2024/01/oleksiy-arestovych-zelenskyys-challenger/\">https://unherd.com/2024/01/oleksiy-arestovych-zelenskyys-challenger/</a>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I was in office, I heard them say that four and a half million men, around half of the whole fighting age male population of Ukraine, had avoided registering at the recruitment centre, not for recruitment purposes but to check their personal data. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Strike-capable drones are a supplement and a crutch when one lacks conventional capabilities, but not a replacement. Very thin competitive edge between drones and EW. </p></li>\n<li><p>Relatively effective gun-based anti-drone defence using mobile gun-based AA units coupled with a Ukraine-wide sensor network. Intercepts about 40% of the Shaheds and cruise missiles. Needs things like tablets and thermal scopes. Kofman didn&#39;t stated it but in a Jack Walting&#39;s book talk, this sensor network included acoustic sensors, aka microphones, that pick up the noise signatures of drones and missiles and with that, predicts the flight paths and likely targets and shifts the mobile AA gun units around. Acoustic and IR sensors can be reconfigured and reprogrammed to better detect and engage drones without being an emitter.</p></li>\n<li><p>both sides have problems scaling up offensives beyond platoon-company levels but Russia has an edge in having larger enabler and support units. For example, Ukraine is having issues with building second and third lines of defence. There are plans, yes, but the lines need to be built. Why? Ukrainian military engineers organic to brigades are focused on digging the first line while the Russian Army has engineer brigades that can handle this. Ukraine has no shortage of construction contractors or equipments that can be contracted to building those lines, but they need to be contracted. (And it&#39;s not like building military fortification is something any contractor would know how to do. They need to select the positions, identify likely enemy avenues of approaches, and integrate eith mutually supporting positions, direct and indirect fire and movement plans, etc ...). UA trimmed a lot of commanding formations and echelons while RUA kept division- and Combined Arms Army-levels of command and thus, they kept, e.g. Engineer brigades.</p></li>\n<li><p>reports of summary executions by the Russians as a method to keep discipline and force men to go forward. &quot;Wagerisation&quot; of the Russian Army. Tactics that once were associated with Wagner are now sort of the norms. Intercepted calls showed mothers and wives of the &quot;volunteers&quot; telling the men to &quot;volunteer&quot; for the storm units because &quot;it&#39;s a lot of money&quot;. More if they die. Very functional relationships right there /s. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/11/24/7430208/\">https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/11/24/7430208/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s Ministries of Defence and Digital Transformation have established an interagency working group to build military engineering and fortification structures with involvement from businesses that are prepared to sponsor the construction of two to three lines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s Ministries of Defence and Digital Transformation becomes the ministry with spare manpower and capacity to be asked to do various things.</p>\n</div>",

I know there are highly trained groups and mechanized groups\n\nYou wrote this earlier, which contradicts what you just wrote:  \n\n>Russian morale is always lower than dog shit for the front line troops.  Cannom fodder is the word they use to describe themselves.  \n\nThat's the ultimate generalization, it characterizes everyone that is a \"front line troop\" as if they're the disposable troops, which they aren't. \n\nIf you don't feel that way, kudos. But there was no way I could let that previous comment go without a reply, it was like bad propaganda.   \n\n\n>The bulk of their forces are not well trained. Probably 80%. They probably represent 90% of their losses.\n\nI get your point and will add that they are doing what you are saying, but deliberately.  \n\nThe Russians do tiered task organization in an insanely ruthless and yet efficient manner. Its one of the most interesting aspects of this war for me, the measures they've taken to make operations work (sometimes). \n\nThe way it seems to be happening, new troops who sign contracts (or were mobilized last year) that show any real promise are sent to better units, where they get pretty decent training (months plural), have pretty good equipment all things considered, good leadership, and are used sparingly. Why? Because there aren't many of them, they're hard to replace, and their OPTEMPO wont allow the Russian military to take a long enough of a breather to create more units of them, for them its a trade-off to use time and resources to either train or fight, and they largely choose fight (a mindset shared by the Ukrainians). \n\nTo make up for their lack of quality infantry in particular, the Russians use lower-tiered troops for an ever growing amount of missions. And because they are performing the missions they don't want the better units to be forced to do, they're going to take heavier losses, so they don't bother training those troops much because there is no point. They're typically staffed with the \"undesirables\" and given only the barebones training needed to do their job, which often entails becoming a casualty as an acceptable loss. \n\nIt's utterly ruthless but it's not a bad system, as long as they can consistently replace those who are actually cannon fodder with more cannon fodder, while ensuring they still do have enough quality troops to conduct the quality missions.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Typically, the \"well trained\" group isn't actually trained. They just figured out how to survive a year and signed a new contract. Training by fire.\n\nSpeaking as a former US Marine and Army infantry NCO, they are actually pretty well trained for the mission they're doing. Sure, their TTPs are laser-focused for this time and space of the Russo-Ukraine War, they definitely aren't being turned into \"Jack of all trades\" like most Western militaries are when it comes to skillsets, especially the US, because we never have a clue what the war we will get into next, we must prepare for so many different contingencies. \n\nThe Russian \"elite\" infantry units, the ones not designed to take fewer losses and often only given missions that are lower risk/higher chance of success, they are actually using some pretty advanced assault TTPs. Minus the use of drones and some of the more modern digital software for situational awareness, etc, most of what they're doing isn't new, but it's still very hard to perform. And they're often doing it knowing they can still take heavy losses if the mission goes tits up, and they don't need to be threatened with summary execution either, they're often motivated enough. \n\nNot only is that Spetsnaz, VDV, MP, but that's some standard motor rifle units too, who created their own internal assault units and staffed them with volunteers looking for more pay but also wanting to be in the \"elite\" unit within the overall unit, doing cool missions that have real merit (assault troops don't man trenches, they don't pull guard duty, they don't dig, they just conduct assaults).   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, Russia still doesn't have an NCO corp. \n\nNeither does Ukraine. Neither does Israel. Neither does most militaries in the world. \n\nA real NCO Corps wouldn't even work in a war like this. Any system that takes many years to create a junior NCO and up to a decade to create a mid level NCOs can't sustain that with heavy losses. That's  why in WW2, Korea, and Vietnam, the US Army and Marines would promote basically anyone to any rank, and it was all On-the-job training too. In Korea, it wasn't uncommon to find a 20 year old master sergeant with only 2 years or less in service. \n\nIn Vietnam, the US Army resorted to \"Shake and Bake\" Sergeants, a private good enough to attend an additional 3 months training to learn how to be a team or squad leader, but not good enough to get sent to OCS to become a commissioned officer, all due to necessity. \n\nDuring the Iraq and Afghan Wars, the US Army was auto-promoting Soldiers to Sergeant without any unit involvement, because there weren't enough (and that attrition wasn't even caused by actual combat losses, it was caused by failing recruitment). \n\nBut what mostly defines whether or not a military force has an actual NCO Corps or not is the power and influence of the senior NCO ranks.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>What you said didn&#39;t contradict what I said at all. I know there are more trained troops in Russia. I know there are highly trained groups and mechanized groups</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You wrote this earlier, which contradicts what you just wrote:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian morale is always lower than dog shit for the front line troops.  Cannom fodder is the word they use to describe themselves.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the ultimate generalization, it characterizes everyone that is a &quot;front line troop&quot; as if they&#39;re the disposable troops, which they aren&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t feel that way, kudos. But there was no way I could let that previous comment go without a reply, it was like bad propaganda.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bulk of their forces are not well trained. Probably 80%. They probably represent 90% of their losses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I get your point and will add that they are doing what you are saying, but deliberately.  </p>\n\n<p>The Russians do tiered task organization in an insanely ruthless and yet efficient manner. Its one of the most interesting aspects of this war for me, the measures they&#39;ve taken to make operations work (sometimes). </p>\n\n<p>The way it seems to be happening, new troops who sign contracts (or were mobilized last year) that show any real promise are sent to better units, where they get pretty decent training (months plural), have pretty good equipment all things considered, good leadership, and are used sparingly. Why? Because there aren&#39;t many of them, they&#39;re hard to replace, and their OPTEMPO wont allow the Russian military to take a long enough of a breather to create more units of them, for them its a trade-off to use time and resources to either train or fight, and they largely choose fight (a mindset shared by the Ukrainians). </p>\n\n<p>To make up for their lack of quality infantry in particular, the Russians use lower-tiered troops for an ever growing amount of missions. And because they are performing the missions they don&#39;t want the better units to be forced to do, they&#39;re going to take heavier losses, so they don&#39;t bother training those troops much because there is no point. They&#39;re typically staffed with the &quot;undesirables&quot; and given only the barebones training needed to do their job, which often entails becoming a casualty as an acceptable loss. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s utterly ruthless but it&#39;s not a bad system, as long as they can consistently replace those who are actually cannon fodder with more cannon fodder, while ensuring they still do have enough quality troops to conduct the quality missions.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Typically, the &quot;well trained&quot; group isn&#39;t actually trained. They just figured out how to survive a year and signed a new contract. Training by fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Speaking as a former US Marine and Army infantry NCO, they are actually pretty well trained for the mission they&#39;re doing. Sure, their TTPs are laser-focused for this time and space of the Russo-Ukraine War, they definitely aren&#39;t being turned into &quot;Jack of all trades&quot; like most Western militaries are when it comes to skillsets, especially the US, because we never have a clue what the war we will get into next, we must prepare for so many different contingencies. </p>\n\n<p>The Russian &quot;elite&quot; infantry units, the ones not designed to take fewer losses and often only given missions that are lower risk/higher chance of success, they are actually using some pretty advanced assault TTPs. Minus the use of drones and some of the more modern digital software for situational awareness, etc, most of what they&#39;re doing isn&#39;t new, but it&#39;s still very hard to perform. And they&#39;re often doing it knowing they can still take heavy losses if the mission goes tits up, and they don&#39;t need to be threatened with summary execution either, they&#39;re often motivated enough. </p>\n\n<p>Not only is that Spetsnaz, VDV, MP, but that&#39;s some standard motor rifle units too, who created their own internal assault units and staffed them with volunteers looking for more pay but also wanting to be in the &quot;elite&quot; unit within the overall unit, doing cool missions that have real merit (assault troops don&#39;t man trenches, they don&#39;t pull guard duty, they don&#39;t dig, they just conduct assaults).   </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, Russia still doesn&#39;t have an NCO corp. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither does Ukraine. Neither does Israel. Neither does most militaries in the world. </p>\n\n<p>A real NCO Corps wouldn&#39;t even work in a war like this. Any system that takes many years to create a junior NCO and up to a decade to create a mid level NCOs can&#39;t sustain that with heavy losses. That&#39;s  why in WW2, Korea, and Vietnam, the US Army and Marines would promote basically anyone to any rank, and it was all On-the-job training too. In Korea, it wasn&#39;t uncommon to find a 20 year old master sergeant with only 2 years or less in service. </p>\n\n<p>In Vietnam, the US Army resorted to &quot;Shake and Bake&quot; Sergeants, a private good enough to attend an additional 3 months training to learn how to be a team or squad leader, but not good enough to get sent to OCS to become a commissioned officer, all due to necessity. </p>\n\n<p>During the Iraq and Afghan Wars, the US Army was auto-promoting Soldiers to Sergeant without any unit involvement, because there weren&#39;t enough (and that attrition wasn&#39;t even caused by actual combat losses, it was caused by failing recruitment). </p>\n\n<p>But what mostly defines whether or not a military force has an actual NCO Corps or not is the power and influence of the senior NCO ranks. Not only do those take a decade plus to create, but they perform a very specific job that is done by either commissioned officers or warrant officers in other armies. </p>\n\n<p>For the Russians in particular, their commissioned officers do a lot of the jobs that a junior or mid level NCO would do in a Western army, and their warrant officers do the jobs that the senior NCOs do, it&#39;s just a slightly different career path but basically the same thing: a Soviet-Russian junior NCO wanting to stay in the military and remain in that MOS becomes a warrant officer instead of a senior NCO, and that job takes them out of the line and into a job that focuses on the larger troop leading, logistics, and admin roles of the unit. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue for the Russian army isn&#39;t their lack of a real NCO Corps, it&#39;s their deliberate choice to limit independence and initiative for the subordinate leaders, especially officers.

        "body": "The second of the two articles about the corruption and failure of important support systems in Ukraine with this about the medical care that severely wounded veterans are being denied.  This story is based on dozens of interviews with Ukrainian active servicemen, veterans, and experts with knowledge of Ukraine\u2019s military medical system. Some of the soldiers and veterans in the story are identified by their first name or callsign only because they fear retribution as they continue fighting for their benefits or to be discharged following injuries. One soldier, entangled in a legal battle to be discharged, is identified under a pseudonym. The Kyiv Independent corroborated their stories by reviewing their medical records and listening to recordings of some of their conversations with doctors.\n\nI've quoted about attempted reforms and hope they yield positive change because some people that made real sacrifices are getting screwed.  *\u201cThey tell me: \u2018Present two witnesses.\u2019 I say: \u201cAre you morons? What two witnesses? I\u2019m the only one left. Out of the last 10 guys, I\u2019m the only survivor.\u2019 But they demand two witnesses\u2026 I was told that I was labeled \u2018absent without leave\u2019.\"*  \n\n['Abandon all hope:' Ukraine\u2019s wounded warriors compare military medical system to the Inferno | Kyiv Independent | March 2024](https://kyivindependent.com/abandon-all-hope-ukraines-wounded-warriors-compare-military-medical-system-to-the-inferno/)\n\n*Military medical commissions (abbreviated locally as VLK) are central to many issues. A VLK is a quorum of doctors who decide the medical status of service members passing through their hospital. Many doctors have questionable competence and integrity, according to veterans. Ukraine\u2019s obsolete military protocols have also done a lot of damage.*\n\n*Starting treatment in spring 2023, Sluchynskyi got the full experience. He sat in long lines of injured veterans for days at a time. He ran around trying to track down medical specialists, with extremely tight schedules and deadlines. According to him, their examinations were perfunctory at best, actively diminishing the severity of his injuries at worst.*\n\n*To complete his medical checkups, his unit made him find two eyewitnesses to testify that he actually got his injuries in front-line combat. Throughout, military regulations did not allow him to leave his base to rest at home, except by the leave of his commander.*\n\n*And in spite of his near-fatal injuries, Sluchynskyi was not initially granted a clean separation \u2014 he said they put him down as \u201cpartially suitable\u201d for military service. Sluchynskyi said he ultimately had to hire a lawyer and go to court to fight for his discharge. Getting his disability benefits was also a struggle.*\n\n*Sluchynskyi\u2019s story is so common across the Ukrainian military that when Tetyana Ostashchenko, the head of the military medical service was fired in November, new Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a statement that \u201cevery service member knows\u201d why she had to go.*\n\n*The Defense Ministry and the General Staff listed the reforms that have been planned, launched, or completed, acknowledging the problems indirectly through moves to fix them.*\n\n*On the technical side, the ministry and the Armed Forces introduced things like electronic queues and simplified document exchanges, and cut down how long it takes for soldiers to get critical files like \u201ccircumstances of injury.\u201d Regulation-wise, old standard operating procedures are being changed, international medical standards have been adopted, and a dedicated hotline and website for injured vets have been introduced.*\n\n*The Defense Ministry changed leadership in November and is reorganizing some departments \u2014 in December, Deputy Minister Stanislav Haider told the Kyiv Independent he\u2019d like to see personnel affairs and social security combined into one.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The second of the two articles about the corruption and failure of important support systems in Ukraine with this about the medical care that severely wounded veterans are being denied.  This story is based on dozens of interviews with Ukrainian active servicemen, veterans, and experts with knowledge of Ukraine\u2019s military medical system. Some of the soldiers and veterans in the story are identified by their first name or callsign only because they fear retribution as they continue fighting for their benefits or to be discharged following injuries. One soldier, entangled in a legal battle to be discharged, is identified under a pseudonym. The Kyiv Independent corroborated their stories by reviewing their medical records and listening to recordings of some of their conversations with doctors.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve quoted about attempted reforms and hope they yield positive change because some people that made real sacrifices are getting screwed.  <em>\u201cThey tell me: \u2018Present two witnesses.\u2019 I say: \u201cAre you morons? What two witnesses? I\u2019m the only one left. Out of the last 10 guys, I\u2019m the only survivor.\u2019 But they demand two witnesses\u2026 I was told that I was labeled \u2018absent without leave\u2019.&quot;</em>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/abandon-all-hope-ukraines-wounded-warriors-compare-military-medical-system-to-the-inferno/\">&#39;Abandon all hope:&#39; Ukraine\u2019s wounded warriors compare military medical system to the Inferno | Kyiv Independent | March 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Military medical commissions (abbreviated locally as VLK) are central to many issues. A VLK is a quorum of doctors who decide the medical status of service members passing through their hospital. Many doctors have questionable competence and integrity, according to veterans. Ukraine\u2019s obsolete military protocols have also done a lot of damage.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Starting treatment in spring 2023, Sluchynskyi got the full experience. He sat in long lines of injured veterans for days at a time. He ran around trying to track down medical specialists, with extremely tight schedules and deadlines. According to him, their examinations were perfunctory at best, actively diminishing the severity of his injuries at worst.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>To complete his medical checkups, his unit made him find two eyewitnesses to testify that he actually got his injuries in front-line combat. Throughout, military regulations did not allow him to leave his base to rest at home, except by the leave of his commander.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>And in spite of his near-fatal injuries, Sluchynskyi was not initially granted a clean separation \u2014 he said they put him down as \u201cpartially suitable\u201d for military service. Sluchynskyi said he ultimately had to hire a lawyer and go to court to fight for his discharge. Getting his disability benefits was also a struggle.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Sluchynskyi\u2019s story is so common across the Ukrainian military that when Tetyana Ostashchenko, the head of the military medical service was fired in November, new Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a statement that \u201cevery service member knows\u201d why she had to go.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Defense Ministry and the General Staff listed the reforms that have been planned, launched, or completed, acknowledging the problems indirectly through moves to fix them.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>On the technical side, the ministry and the Armed Forces introduced things like electronic queues and simplified document exchanges, and cut down how long it takes for soldiers to get critical files like \u201ccircumstances of injury.\u201d Regulation-wise, old standard operating procedures are being changed, international medical standards have been adopted, and a dedicated hotline and website for injured vets have been introduced.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Defense Ministry changed leadership in November and is reorganizing some departments \u2014 in December, Deputy Minister Stanislav Haider told the Kyiv Independent he\u2019d like to see personnel affairs and social security combined into one. The General Staff, which changed leadership in February, wrote that it\u2019s continually working to improve the quality of medical care and administrative services for veterans and trying to make things more \u201chuman-centric.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>And Bill 10449 \u201cOn Mobilization,\u201d now in parliament, is meant to resolve multiple issues with how VLKs determine fitness to serve.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>According to veterans and volunteers, major reforms began to arrive in the second half of 2023.

The fact only surprised those who didn't take seriously the amateur history essay that Vladimir Putin had published the previous summer, \"On unity between Russians and Ukrainians\", in which he essentially argued that Russians and Ukrainians were the same people.\n\nAs with any compromise in crisis, the signs of wear and tear had long been clear. Georgians can rightly say that the end of the post-war international system came in 2008, when the Russian Federation provoked a conflict that resulted in the creation of two pseudo-separatist republics on Georgian territory. Moldovans can also rightly say that the \"frozen conflict\" in Transnistria has been going on since the 1990s. And the Palestinians can say that no one has done them justice since the immediate post-war period, which would make the international system itself hypocritical from the start.\n\nBut in fact, even with this good dose of hypocrisy (or despite it, or according to some because of it) the truth is that this international system has existed and worked. In terms of relations between states and people, the starting point of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was that it was only a document with a moral reference (there is no Universal Court of Human Rights where we can enforce it) but that the member states of the United Nations were committed to promoting and respecting it. In terms of relations between states, the commitment was that the principles of the UN Charter applied (according to which, for example, a state can only use military force in self-defence or with the authorization of the UN itself) and that the permanent members of the Security Council had an obligation to at least disguise their imperial ambitions in terms that were compatible with the Charter itself, and their status.\n\nOf course, the superpowers fought proxy wars, and were jealous of their sphere of influence. The Charter has suffered several severe blows, one of the biggest being the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The coup de grace, however, was delivered by Putin's Russia in February 2022, and why? Because there was no disguising the naked reality: Putin thinks Ukraine should be his and he thinks he should take it by force. Instead of the tacit understanding that the international system would be a kind of \"aristocratic republic\" in which five countries had veto power, we have entered a period of pure and hard neo-imperialism.\n\nWhoever has the force of arms is in charge. That's why everything is breaking out at once everywhere. If force is the new law, every \"strongman\" has free rein to solve his \"problems\" (usually people of another ethnicity) at will, to decide disputes and to fulfill old irredentist dreams and territorial ambitions.\n\nHardly anyone has noticed, but between Ukraine and Palestine, Azerbaijan has ethnically cleansed a hundred thousand Armenians on its territory, and has ambitions to dig a corridor into the Republic of Armenia itself in order to gain access to an enclave of its own. It can do this because it has Turkey's support, Russia is occupied in Ukraine and the whole world is distracted, so why not? We should expect more of this, we just don't know where. Iran? North Korea?\n\nThis phase will last at least until the White House elections and, if Trump wins, well beyond that. And in the meantime, it's embarrassing to see Europe, a year and a bit away from being alone in this world of adult geopolitics, as always disoriented, without leadership or strategic thinking.\"\n\nOn that note, Cyprus it is too, then, should Erdogan want it. It's the world we've chosen for ourselves ever since at least 2014, and it can get much worse.",

In the Netherlands, Putin only got 2% of the vote. Greece was Putin's best country, and even there he \"only\" got 59%. Note that those are exit polls - the real votes are secret.\n\n\nHow did Putin perform in Russia for comparison? Officially he got 88%, but that's just an arbitrary number which is even more arbitrary when you also have digital voting.\n\n\nAccording to the [Sphilkin method](https://twitter.com/jakluge/status/1769752881777844643), which assumes that the relationship between turnout and Putin's vote share follows the normal (Gaussian) distribution, Putin got about 44% of the vote - despite no real competition - so Greece might actually be his best country.\n\n\nBut wait, isn't the Russian economy supposed to be booming? With an interest rate of 16% and official inflation much lower than that, it's likely that the real GDP is inflated.

Very few businesses have that kind of return on investment. Also, Chinese ICE trucks are less efficient, so that's another penalty. China isn't very interested in ICE tech, which is another mismatch.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, trains [aren't much better](https://twitter.com/delfoo/status/1769824729966260700):\n\n\n>Container railway traffic bound east is also incredibly expensive due to the priority placed by the state on shipping oil and coal east with prices reaching 200 000 roubles per container.\n\n\n>Plus we have already seen it impact cement prices as railway transport of cement has become 11-23% more expensive.\n\n\nWith transportation becoming more expensive, everything will follow, and that's before taking gasoline shortages into account.

This effort was also made possible by the double noble lie that &quot;most French supported De Gaulle&quot; and &quot;most German were forced to follow the Nazis&quot; - this double lie meant that a reconciliation was not a betrayal. By contrast there&#39;s a lot of nostalgia for the USSR in Russia, so pretending that &quot;it was all because of Stalin&quot; does not really work. So the political will was not there.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>3) Of course a big part of the French German reconciliation was that it was pushed for by the US and that both feared the USSR. This incentive didn&#39;t exist for post 1990 Russia.</p>\n</div>",

After the communist takeover of Yugoslavia by Tito, of the approximate half a million Germans living in the country, fifty thousand or over 10% were killed systematically and the rest expelled. In Hungary, Soviet archives documented the transference of 62% of the Germans they registered to forced labor camps in the Soviet Union under orders from the Red Army. In Poland and the wider Oder-Neisse, the NKVD rounded up anyone suspected of being a Volksdeutsche with over 3 million forced to relocate. None of this includes the Germans transferred to the [Special Settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_settlements_in_the_Soviet_Union) where over a million Germans living in Soviet territories were expelled to. Though the West shares the stain for being a party and signatory to Potsdam while being fully aware of the fate of these people as well as of the almost two million Soviet citizens that were returned to the Soviet Union, the reason German integration was possible not because \"they don't want to remember a bit of their harsh past\" but because they are aware of their history and their treatment under various Communist regimes.",

Here a special mention should be made of UK / Thatcher who I'm sure you know were perhaps the strongest of allies of US / Reagan; but in this they were diametrically opposed. So from European perspective, to stay in good graces with USA they'd have to sacrifice economic wellbeing to satisfy strategic cooperation--that calculus made no sense. Furthermore, there was also a disagreement over strategic goals. USA wanted containment, deterrence, etc. Europe wanted detente and cooperation. \n\nIf the Reagan episode doesn't convince you that Europe actively resisted USA, then you can also look at CIA documents from the era-- I think it is quite clear that Europe was not going in the direction US wanted it to go. \n\nAll of that said, I think aside from the ~2004 or so when there was a mini-trade war between US and EU; I do think that EU has largely followed US's lead. But also, there hasn't been that many black swans which would require re-alignment or change of strategy. The cooperation with USSR from European side was largely due to a global economic crisis and Europe's over reliance on OPEC.\n\nIf some sort of economic downturn happens again such as those before, I don't see why EU would not once again look out for its own economic interests.

            "body": "Chemical weapons were something very much considered during the Cold War, and Russia had doctrine to use them. So too did the US. SO its not so much about that tired old line that they arn't applicable to modern warfare. There is some value there. Its just low in comparison to what it might cost.\n\nIn terms of what chemical warfare gives you, the first use is always going to be your best. If employed against troops, hopefully in the open, without taking proper NBC protections, CW will be highly effective. Especially if the troops either lack proper equipment at all, if that equipment was of poor quality or not well maintained, or if training in NBC is so poor that troops genuinely cannot effectively use what they have. All three of which may describe a first use in Ukraine. But after that, any force whose not abjectly negligent is not going to get caught again. Any equipment near the front will be deployed, troops will take the threat seriously, and ineffective equipment/bad training will quickly be weeded out and replaced. Such that you will have dramatic diminishing returns on effectiveness within hours of the first use. And if you consider the Ukraine situation, the first serious largescale use of CW is going to trigger a western response and a huge flow of relatively good CW equipment into the theater. Within a week or two, CW will be marginally useful at best. \n\nBUT! thats not to say its not useful at all. Prolonged CW in the modern context has been considered and studied extensively and it *does* have some impact. In that it makes war way more annoying and uncomfortable. MOP gear is hot (they tell me) its restrictive, and if it tears youre fucked. Tear your shirt in a normal situation, nbd. Tear your mask, or your shirt, or whatever in a CW environment and youre in a lot of trouble. Who this really impacts are infantry, who have to fight with more equipment and less SA (though both sides will need to take NBC precautions, so actually its more likely a wash) and rear area troops. Indeed the US, in some of its Cold War war planning, envisioned using F-4s with sprayer tanks to drop and reup persistent CW on Soviet airbases and logistics hubs. The idea was you would likely not kill many soldiers, but you would force every soldier to work more slowly and operate more cautiously doing mundane tasks. Imagine loading a truck in MOP gear in August, I bet that would suck. Or doing an engine overhaul on a jet. All that gets way more annoying, and during a situation where every day counts (as was the thinking in the 1970s and 80s) that kind of lag could be quite significant. Significant enough that this was a desired capability that the US & USSR planned for. \n\nBut what are the costs? Well its tough to maintain and deliver the weapons, of course, but a solvable problem. Tougher to maintain secrecy because the use of CW requires certain precautions (which is why I dont find it compelling that Russia has/will soon use them) be taken which are quite visible. The real issue is that it doesn't buy you much, annoying ground crews might be useful in the short term but not something youre going to do 18 mo. continuously, and yet long term will be hugely negatively impactful to the war effort. Its yet another thing that will galvanize opinion against Russia, will pull the western allies closer together, will make it harder for China and India to stay neutral or \"\"\"neutral\"\"\" respectively, and will only further punish those who appear to be weak on the war. Ditto a hundred fold if the weapon even accidentally causes civilian casualties. And weve seen that, regardless of intention, Russia struggles using weapons indiscriminately. So a CW release would clearly be setting them up for a situation where they would incur basically the maximum diplomatic penalty while also getting them a bunch of nothing. If there was a real possibility that a first use could open up the gates to Kyiv and end the war, I could see a use case especially as Russia becomes more diplomatically isolated (which, IMO, would only deep if they looked on the verge of winning). But fighting over Bakhmut or Adviika? Those are not prizes worth the cost of using CW to clear them. \n\nYou also have a further complication which undermines the role of CW in warfare, and thats the nuclear issue. Again, if we establish that CW is not particularly effective past the first use, and we except that WWI has created a unique horror around CW (such that we lump it in with nukes and biologics as WMDs) why not just nuke them? If you anticipate incurring a maximal negative penalty anyway, and you think CW is of dubious effectiveness outside a very limited region, nuclear weapons are attractive. This, I think, is important as well when we consider a potential defensive use. If Crimea were threatened IDK that Russia would use CW to defend the Isthmus though it may be the single best area in the region to do so. But I bet they would contemplate using nuclear weapons to defend it, as good or better effect. And again, if youre going to break taboos and become the next Hitler anyway, why take an ineffectual half step?",
