        "body": "Grim question rattling around my brain these past few weeks: what is the best Ukraine can actually do in a future counter-offensive? What are the conditions they need to create to achieve that best state?\n\nIt's easy to poke at current Russian tactics and shake your head at tanks driving into the same minefield and so on, but the more I think about it the more I wonder just how Ukraine can do much better. Yes, they will have western tanks - and those tanks can be also be blown up or disabled by mines, ATGM, and mud. Yes, they will have some amount of western training - but we're talking a couple of months, max, not the year+ it takes to produce a typical \"western\" soldier. There's no chance of a western style air campaign, and it seems that America isn't going to supply them with the quantity of other weapons they'd need to simulate the effect, so when they finally do attack, they'll suddenly be in the same position as the Russians are: trying to break through a heavily defended front without any of the modern tools that make it better than \"WWII with drones\".\n\nFrom what I've read, the Kharkiv counter-offensive began when they discovered a weak point in the line and briefly were able to get a maneuver campaign going before bogging down when hitting more Russian mass. Kherson took months of shaping the battlefield in an extremely favorable position for interdicting Russian supplies before it decisively broke in Ukraine's favor, with lots of brutal, slow attrition along the way (along with painful setbacks like Davydiv Brid). Neither of these conditions appear to exist anywhere on the remaining frontline. Russian mass along the existing line seems to be sufficient to prevent another Kharkiv, and there's no logistical barrier equivalent to the Dnieper available to create another Kherson.\n\nSo... what are their options, realistically? How could they use the capability they're building to create a real breakthrough and movement?",

            "body": "Kharkov was an operation likely planned from the saddle. The UA created it thanks to intense messaging re Kherson. They recognized the opportunity. And they made good use of it. Kherson was a long term, attritional, set piece battle. A classic Soviet operation, they advanced methodically to crush the life out of a Russian bridgehead. They had the right tech, understood the right weak points of Russia\u2019s position, and suppressed them to good results. \n\nWhat they need to do now is something in between the two positions. Ukraine needs to fight and win a set piece breakthrough battle. There won\u2019t be a weak point anywhere along the line at this point, Russia has fortifications in many places, big experienced units in other. Ukraine needs to be able to enter the Russian defensive zone (preferably in an economy of force sector), punch through the defensive zone, and insert fresh mobile forces into the rear are to exploit, hit command nodes, take political objectives. And they have to do it all fast enough and violently enough to begin maneuvering *before* Russian reserves flood in. Or pin reserves in place by fighting a breakthrough battle in multiple sectors. And the UA has to do it aggressively and quickly but without getting their balls slammed in a door by Russian counter attacks. Classic Blitz, also the basic concept behind the deep battle. It\u2019s easy to write out on paper but very hard to do, Russia has been trying and failing for 12mo to do it. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about, as I normally do, about the Yom Kippur War. In that case, down in the Sinai, you had a period of equilibrium where the line was established, the Egyptians had dug in, and their defensive system was better tested than the Russians. They turned the Israelis back after the first counter attack. But after a few days of stability, the Israelis located an ~2km gap which existed between the two Egyptian armies. It should have been covered, but the previous fighting had pulled the two forces apart and inward, and so the gap. The Israelis hit it at night, tore it open, and poured through and over the canal. But it was a tough fight, the flanks of their formation were entirely within Egyptian RPG and AT-3 range, and it took days to fully secure the crossing corridor. But the Israelis were ready, had the right assets in the right places, and so were perfectly poised to make the crossing. \n\nThe thing I think is that in a place like Zapro, the line looks pretty tough and getting tougher. The UA will need to find a flaw, a fault. The legendary gap, the great mule shoe, in an otherwise strong position. By pounding that position they can enter into the battle area and hopefully go from a static position battle to a fluid mobile one. But ultimately that requires them to have a fully integrated modern force. From identifying the spot, to planning the attack, to moving the right forces to the right place, to be actual battle itself. From start to finish they need to have a tight ship. And that\u2019s the tough part of where they\u2019re at now.",

No English subs but here are the most important bullet points from each presentation:\n\n**Participatory territorial defense**\n\n- Strong willingness to participate in national defense (80%+ in polls) gives Finland a good starting point for TD\n\n- Maximal use of local expertise, cooperation with local authorities and enforcement - from now on, also involve allies here\n\n- Broad spectrum voluntary participation to augment crisis resilience and regular defense (examples: electricians preparing resources to help their communities, reservist volunteers as trainers). Everyone can ask themselves: how could you help your nation in crisis? Plan a few steps you could take with your skills and assets, even if it's just starting a generator and helping your neighbours to the shelter.\n\n**The first phase of UA war**\n\n- Depth: the enemy can quickly gain substantial depth. Well prepared territorial defense key to turn that into a weakness; can't allow empty spots in depth.\n\n- TD preparedness: must prepare surveillance for every road and village and, when needed and useful, resistance.\n\n- Cooperation with officials: information flow across all decision-makers throughout the country, military or civilian, local or national. Unified official comms with that in mind. Civilian evacuations must be ensured to avoid Mariupol scenarios.\n\n**Hybrid CoE**\n\n- Hybrid operations have not stopped despite conventional invasion starting. Social cohesion, trust & will to defend key in countering that. Cyber still important to block. Important to think through the logic of escalation on a per conflict basis.\n\n**Rescue and repair**\n\n- Finnish rescue authorities consulted with Ukrainian counterparts recently, based on remarks there\n\n- Repair: not just the acquisition but also the locations of spare parts crucial \n\n- Cooperation btw rescue & military important. For example: make sure your system doesn't draft firefighters. Not an issue in Finland thanks to prepared integration of civilian and military assets, but happened in Ukraine and substantially hurt rescue efforts in the beginning.\n\n- Ensure civilian rescue workers know how to operate in ruins, deal with UXO, and cooperate with NGOs & international aid.\n\n- Finland already has good practices on civilian evac, but civilian rescue authorities need more experience on air warning systems.\n\n**Border guards**\n\n- Ukraine's border guards 35K->65K strength (peacetime->now)\n\n- Short presentation to kick off a panel, mostly obvious stuff regarding eg hybrid operations on the border (Belarus-Poland in 2020), need for surveillance, and that Finland has received refugees during the war.",

Senior American generals hosted Ukrainian military officials last week in Wiesbaden, Germany, for a set of tabletop exercises to help Kyiv get ready for the next stage of the war.\n\n>U.S. military officials believe Kyiv is looking to mount its offensive in the next six to eight weeks as the weather warms up and Ukrainian forces finish their training on combined arms maneuver tactics in Germany, the DoD officials said. Officials are concerned that Ukraine is running low on air defenses as Russia continues missile attacks and even sends decoy balloons with radar reflectors to deplete Ukrainian missiles.\n\n>Ukraine has been pushing for modern fighter jets for the conflict, among other things to help with air defense, but so far there is little appetite among Western leaders to send more advanced aircraft such as the F-16. Two Ukrainian pilots are in the U.S. to do an assessment of their skills on simulators at an Air National Guard base in Tucson, Ariz., but officials said they will not fly American aircraft.\n\n>Officials are looking for more creative solutions to fill that gap. The U.S. has already provided Kyiv air-to-ground missiles, such as the AGM-88B High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile, which can be attached to the MiGs and used against ground targets such as radars and air defense systems. The Pentagon has also sent the Joint Direct Attack Munition, which converts air-launched munitions into smart bombs.\n\n>But integrating the AIM-120s with MiGs would be the first time the U.S. has provided the capability to fire air-to-air missiles from aircraft, however. Ukraine already has a number of the missiles, which were provided by European countries, including the U.K. and Belgium, which are fired from Western-provided air defense systems such as the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System.\n\n>But the integration process poses challenges, said one of the DoD officials and another person with direct knowledge of the effort. Both were granted anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations. Not only must the missile physically be fitted onto the aircraft, it must also \u201ctalk\u201d to the aircraft\u2019s radar. To fire a shot, first the aircraft radar gives the missile a target, and guides the missile until it is close enough to find the target on its own.\n\n>The main problem is that the American and Soviet systems are so different that the missile and aircraft can\u2019t communicate with each other.\n\n>The military is working on: \u201cHow do you mount this thing? Can you get all the electronics in the aircraft to talk to this thing that wasn\u2019t meant to be launched?\u201d said one of the DoD officials.\n\n>A DoD spokesperson declined to comment on the effort due to operational security.\n\n>>\u201cWe are in regular contact with Ukrainian leaders, and we\u2019ll continue to consult closely with Ukraine on their security assistance needs \u2014 both near and longer term,\u201d said Lt.

One European defence official says that the infusion of arms agreed in Germany in January alone amounts to two-thirds of the total sent to Ukraine in all of 2022. Most of the donations are not as sexy as tanks, but are still crucial\u2014the latest American package includes armoured bridge-laying vehicles, for instance, which would be vital for any offensive in the south or east.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s army is being transformed as a result. The bulk of its hardware is still of Soviet origin. But whereas the ratio of Ukrainian to Western kit stood at five to one at the end of last year, that is expected to fall to five to two as the aid flows in. In other words, almost a third of Ukraine\u2019s army will soon have NATO-standard equipment. General Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s top officer, hopes that he will eventually have three new army corps at his disposal, each with six brigades, and each comprising more than 20,000 men.\n\n>A Russian offensive that began in late January was intended, in part, to force Ukraine to commit these reserves, thereby making it much harder to mount a counter-offensive. In recent days, Russian soldiers and mercenaries have advanced deeper into Bakhmut, a town in Donetsk province that has been under Russian assault since last summer. But the battle for the town has resulted in far greater Russian losses than Ukrainian ones. And more importantly General Zaluzhny has avoided the obvious trap.\n\n>Instead of throwing sizeable reserves into Bakhmut to save the town, which is of far greater symbolic than military value, he has sent troops abroad to train on the new equipment. Since January, America\u2019s 7th Army Training Command has been running a five-week course for Ukrainian units at its Grafenwoehr training area in eastern Bavaria. During its offensives last year, Ukraine\u2019s army largely attacked in company-sized formations. The training in Grafenwoehr is intended to bring these together into bigger battalions and brigades capable of waging \u201ccombined-arms\u201d warfare, in which infantry, armour, artillery and other combat arms work together rather than just sequentially\u2014as is mostly the case now.\n\n>Western officials are divided on whether all this will be enough to eject Russia from the roughly 18% of Ukraine it controls at present. Only a battalion\u2019s worth of soldiers will pass through Grafenwoehr each month; a large proportion of Ukraine\u2019s army is still made up of mobilised men with limited experience. Ammunition remains a serious problem, because Western allies have been slow to ramp up production. And Ukraine\u2019s lack of air power may become a bigger issue if Russian warplanes prove willing to run bigger risks during any Ukrainian offensive.\n\n>On the other hand, Russia\u2019s army is in dire shape. If, after conquering Bakhmut, it decides to plough on deeper into Donetsk, it will have to further run down its own meagre reserves. It might eventually start pulling units from other parts of the long front line, creating gaps that Ukraine can exploit, suggests Gustav Gressel of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. Ukraine\u2019s allies are watching closely for weak points.\n\n>On March 2nd, Mark Milley, America\u2019s top general, visited tabletop wargames held by America at a base in Wiesbaden, Germany, to help Ukrainian officers consider different options for an offensive. Few think that Ukraine can restore its pre-war boundaries at a single stroke, let alone take back territory, including Crimea, seized by Russia in 2014. But if Ukraine can tear another significant chunk out of the Russian occupation, as it did last year in the north-east around Kharkiv, and in the south around Kherson, it would quash the belief\u2014expressed by General Milley, among others\u2014that the war is doomed to stalemate.",

And Ukraine\u2019s lack of air power may become a bigger issue if Russian warplanes prove willing to run bigger risks during any Ukrainian offensive.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Russia\u2019s army is in dire shape. If, after conquering Bakhmut, it decides to plough on deeper into Donetsk, it will have to further run down its own meagre reserves. It might eventually start pulling units from other parts of the long front line, creating gaps that Ukraine can exploit, suggests Gustav Gressel of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. Ukraine\u2019s allies are watching closely for weak points.</p>\n\n<p>On March 2nd, Mark Milley, America\u2019s top general, visited tabletop wargames held by America at a base in Wiesbaden, Germany, to help Ukrainian officers consider different options for an offensive. Few think that Ukraine can restore its pre-war boundaries at a single stroke, let alone take back territory, including Crimea, seized by Russia in 2014. But if Ukraine can tear another significant chunk out of the Russian occupation, as it did last year in the north-east around Kharkiv, and in the south around Kherson, it would quash the belief\u2014expressed by General Milley, among others\u2014that the war is doomed to stalemate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

On Monday morning, CSIS hosted a panel of defense experts, including Elbridge Colby, Bonnie Glaser and Michael Mazarr, and asked the participants to read 87 pages of translated Chinese commentary. Blanchette had chosen three recent Chinese papers on U.S. strategy. He thanked the panelists for doing their \"homework\" before appearing on the webinar.\n\nColby, a former Pentagon official, told the panel he was struck by the sophistication and the nuances of the analyses. He noted that one of the papers correctly construed that a lot of the actions the U.S. is taking in building up deterrence are defensive in nature and have the goal of maintaining the status quo.\n\n\"It gave me a little bit more confidence that if we match our strategic logic in a way that is consistently status-quo oriented, strategically defensive, even if it might involve operational or tactical offensive actions, that we should be able to communicate the point,\" Colby said.\n\nSean Monaghan, a visiting fellow with the CSIS Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program, said he found the papers \"mind blowing.\"\n\n\"Naively, I was expecting Sun Tzu and I got Thomas Schelling and Glenn Snyder,\" Monaghan said, referring to the American game theorist and political scientist, respectively.\n\n\"It's interesting and notable that we have a lot of the same reference points. It's reassuring that we're all singing off the same hymn sheet when it comes to understanding what we mean by deterrence, by compellence, coercion.\"\n\nGlaser, a China expert and managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program, raised doubts that Chinese President Xi Jinping was reading such policy papers. \"Nobody knows what Xi Jinping reads, but I can guarantee you that he doesn't read these articles,\" she joked. But they may be read by others throughout the system, she said. And by U.S. government officials and experts following what is being discussed, there can be a more accurate understanding of what points are shared in the Chinese leadership and what points are being made, Glaser said.\n\n\"If the United States thinks that there is a real misunderstanding of something that the U.S. is doing, reading these articles then gives us the opportunity to go back to the Chinese and say, 'This particular point is a misunderstanding of U.S. policy. That is useful for us to do.'\"\n\nShe gave the example of the \"October surprise,\" when on Oct. 30, 2020, four days before the election that unseated President Donald Trump, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, phoned Chinese counterpart Gen. Li Zuocheng to assure him that the U.S. was not preparing a strike in the South China Sea.\n\nA review of intelligence suggested that the Chinese believed the U.S. was preparing such an attack.\n\n\"This is an example, from reading these kinds of articles, that we can get a sense as to where the Chinese might misread U.S. intentions and take actions to avoid an escalation spiral,\" Glaser said.\n\nThis comes amid a bipartisan hardening of positions in Washington over China. At the recent inaugural gathering of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the U.S. and the Chinese Communist Party, politicians on both sides of the aisle took turns to describe the threat China poses.\n\n\"We may call this a strategic competition, but it's not a polite tennis match. This is an existential struggle over what life will look like in the 21st century, and the most fundamental freedoms are at stake,\" said Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of the select committee. The Chinese Communist Party \"is laser-focused on its vision for the future, a world crowded with techno-totalitarian surveillance states where human rights are subordinate to the whims of the party,\" he said.\n\nRanking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat, said, \"Over the last three decades, both Democrats and Republicans underestimated the CCP and assumed that trade and investment would inevitably lead to democracy and greater security in the Indo-Pacific region, including in [China]. Instead, the opposite happened.\"\n\nJournalist Fareed Zakaria said on his CNN program on Sunday that watching the Feb. 28 hearing of the House committee was like being transported back to the 1950s. \"Members of both parties tried to outdo each other in their denunciations of China. It creates a dynamic that makes rational policy difficult,\" he said.\n\nBut a correct understanding of Beijing's intentions does not automatically lead to better policies.\n\nThe U.S. is trapped in a security dilemma, Mazarr, a senior political scientist at RAND Corp., said during Monday's webinar.\n\n\"China is building up its military capability, so we feel trapped in a situation where any action other than rapid military reinforcement and development of the military relationship with Taiwan is seen as weak,\" said the expert on deterrence. \"And as long as that dynamic persists, it'll continue to undermine the basis for peace and moving away from it, from a political standpoint, would be extremely difficult.\"",

China messed up initially. It should have locked down Wuhan two weeks earlier than it did. However, the hesitancy of the local government to lock down the city is also completely understandable, given how massive a step that is. And when you compare China's failure to take CoVID seriously before 20 January 2020 with how the US or European countries reacted in the first few months, it's very difficult to single or China for criticism. The US did essentially nothing for two months, even after seeing how devastating the outbreak was in China. The same goes for Europe.\n\nThen, after everyone suddenly realized that the pandemic had come to the US, the anti-China CoVID rhetoric really took off. That's when Trump suddenly started going on about the China virus, it's when the Trump administration started pushing the lab leak theory, etc.\n\nThen there was the whole period from mid-2020 to mid-2022 in which China handled CoVID far better than the US or Europe, but was still endlessly demonized for doing so. People in the West really believe that Chinese people were sitting in lockdown for two years, which is mind-boggling to me, as someone who speaks Chinese and knows what daily life was like there during the pandemic (i.e., far more normal, day to day, than in the US or Europe well into 2022).\n\nI'll also just say one thing about Russia and China. China turning to Russia as a strategic partner is the logical consequence of the threat China feels from the US. If the US wanted China to take a strong stand against Russia, starting a trade war, sanctioning the entire Chinese tech sector, and flirting with the idea of recognizing Taiwanese independence is not the way to do it. Even relatively US-friendly countries in the developing world, like India, are trying to take a middle ground. China has even stronger strategic reasons not to turn against Russia.

One expert cautioned that the amount sounded high.\n\n>However, Sky News understands it is suspected that\u00a0Iran\u00a0has been shipping an amount of ammunition to Russia to help replenish its stocks on the frontline in\u00a0Ukraine.\n\n>Russian supplies are thought to be running low after more than a year of\u00a0President Putin's full-scale war.\n\n>The alleged assistance is on top of previous allegations that\u00a0Tehran provided Moscow with hundreds of deadly drones, which have played a part in attempts to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\n\n>\"Russia continues to use Iran as a 'rear base',\" the security source said, describing the close military ties between the two countries.\n\n>Western and Ukrainian officials have also warned that Iran might supply far deadlier ballistic missiles but there has been no evidence of that happening yet.\n\n>As well as the Iranian support, concern is growing in western capitals about the potential for\u00a0China\u00a0to start supplying Russia with weapons - a move that the\u00a0United States\u00a0has warned would have \"severe consequences\" for Beijing. China has denied the claims.\n\n>**The 'secret' cargo ships**\n\n>The security source said the two general cargo ships allegedly involved in transferring ammunition from Iran to Russia were called the Musa Jalil and the Begey.\n\n>Both sail under the Russian flag.\n\n>Sky News has approached the owner of the ships in Russia for comment on the claims but has so far not received a reply.\n\n>Russia's Ministry of Defence and Iran's Foreign Ministry have also yet to respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The source said one of the ships is thought to have departed Iran on around 10 January and the other on around 12 January.\n\n>Between them, the two vessels were thought to be carrying about 200 shipping containers filled with weaponry, according to the source.\n\n>The source said they were confident in their assessment of the amount of ammunition that was being transported.\n\n>\"Two hundred containers on two ships are capable of carrying this amount of munitions,\" the source added.\n\n>What the marine tracking data tells us\n\n>Research by Sky News' Data & Forensics Unit supported the general claim about the movement of the ships, though the dates slightly differed.\n\n>It was not possible to independently verify what was being transported by the vessels.\n\n>Maritime shipping tracker MarineTraffic placed the two ships at the Iranian port of Amirabad on the Caspian Sea on 9 January. Satellite imagery from the following day obtained by Sky News shows at least one of the ships still at the port.\n\n>According to the maritime tracking data, the Musa Jalil left the port at around 10am local time on 10 January, while the Begey departed on the same day.\n\n>On 12 January, again according to the tracking data, both ships stop off the coast of Turkmenistan for a couple of days. The reason for this is not known.\n\n>The Musa Jalil and the Begey then travelled across the Caspian Sea, arriving at the Russian port of Astrakhan on 27 January. They remained at the port for several days before leaving on 3 February, according to the tracking data.\n\n>The security source did not confirm the name of the port in Iran that the two ships left from, nor which port in Russia they arrived at.\n\n>The source did confirm that the ships travelled to Russia via the Caspian Sea.\n\n>\"Iran sent two cargo ships to the combat zone in Ukraine, carrying approximately 200 new shipping containers that contained ammunition for the Russian fighting in Ukraine,\" the security source said.\n\n>**What's in the cargo?**\n\n>The source listed the alleged cargo as comprising approximately 100 million bullets of varying sizes - 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm, 12.7mm and 14.5mm - to be used in weapons such pistols, assault rifles and machine guns.\n\n>The ships were also carrying a range of other ammunition, the source said, including approximately 300,000 shells, such as 40mm grenades for grenade launchers, 107mm anti-tank rockets, and mortar shells of different sizes - 60mm, 81mm and 120mm - as well as artillery rockets (130mm, 122mm and 152mm) and armour shells (115mm and 125mm).\n\n>In addition, the source said there were close to 10,000 flak jackets and helmets on board.\n\n>\"Russia pays for the ammunition in cash and by doing so, bypasses the western sanctions on it, ignoring the sanctions on Iran,\" the source added.\n\n>**Iran choosing 'wrong side of history'**\n\n>Asked about the claims, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK said he was not surprised that Iran was allegedly supplying ammunition to Russia and said he expected there would be more such support, but he urged the Islamic Republic to stop being on the \"wrong side of history\".\n\n>Vadym Prystaiko told Sky News the fact that Russia has to ask what he dubbed a \"coalition of weak nations\" such as Iran and North Korea for help underlined the difficulties it was facing on the battlefield, using up its own stockpiles of munitions against Ukrainian troops.\n\n>The level of artillery fire in Ukraine has not been seen since the Korean war - straining supply lines on both sides.\n\n>A Ukrainian brigadier has claimed the Russian military had been firing between 60,000 to 70,000 artillery shells a day.\n\n>US officials have put the top rate at 20,000 daily.\n\n>Both Ukraine and the US have said the level has dropped because of stocks running low.\n\"They - allegedly the second biggest army in the world - (are) running out of resources, which is a great result for the Ukrainian armed forces,\" the Ukrainian ambassador said in an interview at the embassy in London.\n\n>The envoy said western sanctions were impacting Russia's ability to use its defence industry to replenish stocks fast enough but more work was needed to shut down other routes.\n\n>\"We still have actively to pursue the Iranians and the rest of these regimes to stop the supply to Russians to fuel this war in Ukraine,\" Mr Prystaiko said.\n\n>General Sir Richard Barrons, a former senior British military officer, said an influx of 300,000 shells from Iran, while helpful for Russia, would not last long given the rate of fire.\n\n>By contrast, should China decide to make its vast munition stockpiles available to President Putin's war machine that would be \"very, very difficult for Ukraine\", he added.\n\nhttps://news.sky.com/story/irans-alleged-ammunition-for-russias-war-in-ukraine-the-secret-journey-of-the-cargo-ships-accused-of-supplying-invasion-12828039",

They remained at the port for several days before leaving on 3 February, according to the tracking data.</p>\n\n<p>The security source did not confirm the name of the port in Iran that the two ships left from, nor which port in Russia they arrived at.</p>\n\n<p>The source did confirm that the ships travelled to Russia via the Caspian Sea.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Iran sent two cargo ships to the combat zone in Ukraine, carrying approximately 200 new shipping containers that contained ammunition for the Russian fighting in Ukraine,&quot; the security source said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What&#39;s in the cargo?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The source listed the alleged cargo as comprising approximately 100 million bullets of varying sizes - 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm, 12.7mm and 14.5mm - to be used in weapons such pistols, assault rifles and machine guns.</p>\n\n<p>The ships were also carrying a range of other ammunition, the source said, including approximately 300,000 shells, such as 40mm grenades for grenade launchers, 107mm anti-tank rockets, and mortar shells of different sizes - 60mm, 81mm and 120mm - as well as artillery rockets (130mm, 122mm and 152mm) and armour shells (115mm and 125mm).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the source said there were close to 10,000 flak jackets and helmets on board.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Russia pays for the ammunition in cash and by doing so, bypasses the western sanctions on it, ignoring the sanctions on Iran,&quot; the source added.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Iran choosing &#39;wrong side of history&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Asked about the claims, Ukraine&#39;s ambassador to the UK said he was not surprised that Iran was allegedly supplying ammunition to Russia and said he expected there would be more such support, but he urged the Islamic Republic to stop being on the &quot;wrong side of history&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Vadym Prystaiko told Sky News the fact that Russia has to ask what he dubbed a &quot;coalition of weak nations&quot; such as Iran and North Korea for help underlined the difficulties it was facing on the battlefield, using up its own stockpiles of munitions against Ukrainian troops.</p>\n\n<p>The level of artillery fire in Ukraine has not been seen since the Korean war - straining supply lines on both sides.</p>\n\n<p>A Ukrainian brigadier has claimed the Russian military had been firing between 60,000 to 70,000 artillery shells a day.</p>\n\n<p>US officials have put the top rate at 20,000 daily.</p>\n\n<p>Both Ukraine and the US have said the level has dropped because of stocks running low.\n&quot;They - allegedly the second biggest army in the world - (are) running out of resources, which is a great result for the Ukrainian armed forces,&quot; the Ukrainian ambassador said in an interview at the embassy in London.</p>\n\n<p>The envoy said western sanctions were impacting Russia&#39;s ability to use its defence industry to replenish stocks fast enough but more work was needed to shut down other routes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We still have actively to pursue the Iranians and the rest of these regimes to stop the supply to Russians to fuel this war in Ukraine,&quot; Mr Prystaiko said.</p>\n\n<p>General Sir Richard Barrons, a former senior British military officer, said an influx of 300,000 shells from Iran, while helpful for Russia, would not last long given the rate of fire.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, should China decide to make its vast munition stockpiles available to President Putin&#39;s war machine that would be &quot;very, very difficult for Ukraine&quot;, he added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/irans-alleged-ammunition-for-russias-war-in-ukraine-the-secret-journey-of-the-cargo-ships-accused-of-supplying-invasion-12828039\">https://news.sky.com/story/irans-alleged-ammunition-for-russias-war-in-ukraine-the-secret-journey-of-the-cargo-ships-accused-of-supplying-invasion-12828039</a></p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[New intelligence on the NordStream investigation from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-ukraine.html):\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 New intelligence reviewed by U.S. officials suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines last year, a step toward determining responsibility for an act of sabotage that has confounded investigators on both sides of the Atlantic for months.\n\nU.S. officials said that they had no evidence President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials.\n\nThe brazen attack on the natural gas pipelines, which link Russia to Western Europe, fueled public speculation about who was to blame, from Moscow to Kyiv and London to Washington, and it has remained one of the most consequential unsolved mysteries of Russia\u2019s year-old war in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine and its allies have been seen by some officials as having the most logical potential motive to attack the pipelines. They have opposed the project for years, calling it a national security threat because it would allow Russia to sell gas more easily to Europe. Ukrainian government and military intelligence officials say they had no role in the attack and do not know who carried it out.\n\nU.S. officials said there was much they did not know about the perpetrators and their affiliations. The review of newly collected intelligence suggests they were opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but does not specify the members of the group, or who directed or paid for the operation. U.S. officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or any details of the strength of the evidence it contains. They have said that there are no firm conclusions about it, leaving open the possibility that the operation might have been conducted off the books by a proxy force with connections to the Ukrainian government or its security services.\n\n... \n\nOfficials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two. U.S. officials said no American or British nationals were involved.\n\nThe pipelines were ripped apart by deep sea explosions in September, in what U.S. officials described at the time as an act of sabotage. European officials have publicly said they believe the operation that targeted Nord Stream was probably state sponsored, possibly because of the sophistication with which the perpetrators planted and detonated the explosives on the floor of the Baltic Sea without being detected. U.S. officials have not stated publicly that they believe the operation was sponsored by a state.\n\nThe explosives were most likely planted with the help of experienced divers who did not appear to be working for military or intelligence services, U.S. officials who have reviewed the new intelligence said. But it is possible that the perpetrators received specialized government training in the past.\n\nOfficials said there were still enormous gaps in what U.S. spy agencies and their European partners knew about what transpired. But officials said it might constitute the first significant lead to emerge from several closely guarded investigations, the conclusions of which could have profound implications for the coalition supporting Ukraine.\n\nAny suggestion of Ukrainian involvement, whether direct or indirect, could upset the delicate relationship between Ukraine and Germany, souring support among a German public that has swallowed high energy prices in the name of solidarity.\n\n... \n\nU.S. officials said the new intelligence reporting has increased their optimism that American spy agencies and their partners in Europe can find more information, which could allow them to reach a firm conclusion about the perpetrators. It is unclear how long that process will take.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-ukraine.html\">New intelligence on the NordStream investigation from the NYT</a>:</p>\n\n<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 New intelligence reviewed by U.S. officials suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines last year, a step toward determining responsibility for an act of sabotage that has confounded investigators on both sides of the Atlantic for months.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials said that they had no evidence President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials.</p>\n\n<p>The brazen attack on the natural gas pipelines, which link Russia to Western Europe, fueled public speculation about who was to blame, from Moscow to Kyiv and London to Washington, and it has remained one of the most consequential unsolved mysteries of Russia\u2019s year-old war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine and its allies have been seen by some officials as having the most logical potential motive to attack the pipelines. They have opposed the project for years, calling it a national security threat because it would allow Russia to sell gas more easily to Europe. Ukrainian government and military intelligence officials say they had no role in the attack and do not know who carried it out.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials said there was much they did not know about the perpetrators and their affiliations. The review of newly collected intelligence suggests they were opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but does not specify the members of the group, or who directed or paid for the operation. U.S. officials declined to disclose the nature of the intelligence, how it was obtained or any details of the strength of the evidence it contains. They have said that there are no firm conclusions about it, leaving open the possibility that the operation might have been conducted off the books by a proxy force with connections to the Ukrainian government or its security services.</p>\n\n<p>... </p>\n\n<p>Officials who have reviewed the intelligence said they believed the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, or some combination of the two. U.S. officials said no American or British nationals were involved.</p>\n\n<p>The pipelines were ripped apart by deep sea explosions in September, in what U.S. officials described at the time as an act of sabotage. European officials have publicly said they believe the operation that targeted Nord Stream was probably state sponsored, possibly because of the sophistication with which the perpetrators planted and detonated the explosives on the floor of the Baltic Sea without being detected. U.S. officials have not stated publicly that they believe the operation was sponsored by a state.</p>\n\n<p>The explosives were most likely planted with the help of experienced divers who did not appear to be working for military or intelligence services, U.S. officials who have reviewed the new intelligence said. But it is possible that the perpetrators received specialized government training in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Officials said there were still enormous gaps in what U.S. spy agencies and their European partners knew about what transpired. But officials said it might constitute the first significant lead to emerge from several closely guarded investigations, the conclusions of which could have profound implications for the coalition supporting Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestion of Ukrainian involvement, whether direct or indirect, could upset the delicate relationship between Ukraine and Germany, souring support among a German public that has swallowed high energy prices in the name of solidarity.</p>\n\n<p>... </p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials said the new intelligence reporting has increased their optimism that American spy agencies and their partners in Europe can find more information, which could allow them to reach a firm conclusion about the perpetrators. It is unclear how long that process will take. American officials recently discussed the intelligence with their European counterparts, who have taken the lead in investigating the attack.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Any findings that put blame on Kyiv or Ukrainian proxies could prompt a backlash in Europe and make it harder for the West to maintain a united front in support of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials and intelligence agencies acknowledge that they have limited visibility into Ukrainian decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Despite Ukraine\u2019s deep dependence on the United States for military, intelligence and diplomatic support, Ukrainian officials are not always transparent with their American counterparts about their military operations, especially those against Russian targets behind enemy lines.

I'm not talking about the whole propaganda / psychological aspect in relation to some larger conflict, but purely the exchange of information for general discussion and casual conversation. \n\nI'll be a little vague and just say I work in the tech industry. I've seen professionals frequently go on forums to anonymously discuss with and educate users quite frequently. And this isn't for any strategic purpose. Sometimes, people will talk too much, present themselves in a not-ideal manner, engage in unproductive or insignificant conversations/debates, etc. \n\nI reason that it's simply fun for people to do. Humans naturally seek out those who share their interests. \n\nBut I think it's wild just how far people will go. \n\nIn my industry, at least, professionals are not actually super impressive so long as you have some good critical thinking capabilities along with a fair bit of knowledge. In the end, we're all human so it's not like professionals are superhumans that are just gonna be so far above everyone in overall ability - although I think sometimes people have that mental image. \n\nAnyway, I can't say I'm a paid professional in anything related to military matters, but I'd like to think that I've educated myself enough throughout my life to know more than the average person. So, I think I am capable of differentiating between nonsense and fair logic. \n\nAnd while I've seen some nonsensical takes on here, I've also seen some discussions where people use rather solid logic and reasoning. And people will say quite a lot just to a bunch of random strangers on some niche internet forum. \n\nSo are people just really dedicated hobbyists?? Or is there a fair mix of global professionals?

One thing to keep in mind is that these professionals come from a dizzying array of specialties, so even someone is a highly qualified expert in one niche may not have much more knowledge of other topics than any other random person pulled off the street. Someone could have a 30 year career in the military and get out without knowing the first thing about combat or strategy, depending on their MOS. Or they could be an expert on small unit tactics but completely ignorant of the nuances of nuclear deterrence. Similarly, this thread and the subreddit in general deal with a wide variety of topics. Technology, economics, politics, strategy, operations, tactics, etc. So you'll get people who are armchair generals, but do have a solid grounding in at least part of the defense space. That can manifest as wildly varying levels of quality between comments in their wheelhouse versus those they are not expert in.  \n\nWhich is part of why it is difficult for many professionals currently employed in the field to contribute. Somewhat perversely it is hardest for them to contribute in the areas for which they have the most expertise, because it is harder to discuss topics where they may accidentally spill controlled information. In my case, I used to work in defense but left a couple years ago. I wouldn't have posted anywhere near this much or in this much detail when there was even a minor risk I would accidentally leak information. Even now, I avoid posting about the topics where I have the most expertise precisely for that reason. I even hesitate to specify what that expertise is, lest it invite unwanted attention.\n\nAlso, I think many people expect professional military analysis and content to look like what expert defense analysts publish. So they come here hoping for someone like Mark Hertling or Ben Hodges or Perun to explain defense topics in non-jargony terms. But that's not what most professional military writing looks like. It's mostly borderline unreadable, with stilted, awkward language that often obscures simple concepts behind truly excessive amounts of abbreviations and jargon. Even professionals don't want to write like that in their free time. So what you get here is a much more colloquial version of the same kinds of analysis professionals conduct. In terms of tone, it reads more like one of my old Teams threads with coworkers than like any professional intelligence work product. And of course a lack of reliable information from trusted intelligence professionals limits the quality of conclusions reached here. But that is fine for the slightly less formal tone of the daily megathread, because smart, well-informed people applying common sense and logic to the problem space is pretty interesting in and of itself and it's not like anyone is making actual decisions based on the information and analysis shared here.",
