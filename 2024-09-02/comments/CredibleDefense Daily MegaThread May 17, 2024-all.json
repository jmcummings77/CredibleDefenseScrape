            "body": "The Dutch navy is undergoing quite the renaissance in general. [The defense ministry is replacing most of its major naval surface combatants in the next 15 years, which it said will significantly improve Dutch maritime capabilities, while the resulting industrial cooperation will \u201cprovide a powerful boost to European strategic autonomy and the Dutch defense industry.\u201d](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/03/01/netherlands-plans-four-new-air-defense-frigates/) \n\nConsidering the Dutch position on Russia, Dutch shipbuilding capabilities, the recent Dutch Ukrainian security agreement and the fact that they're already training Ukrainians on mine sweepers to be delivered in 2025, I think it's possible that the Dutch government has identified the Ukrainian Black Sea fleet as an overlooked sector and is positioning itself to assist in its post war reconstruction and alignment with NATO. Having a lot of reasonably new NATO ships on hand with the replacements already on the way is a great foundation to execute such a plan in a few years.",

The incursions and shelling of Belgorod [area] is likely causing some kind of issue for Putin personally and the Kremlin in general. That said I haven't seen any significant unrest / political costs as it hasn't been widely reported in international media.\n\nAnd yes, they are likely wanting to stretch lines and Belgorod is a good area to do so. They are linked to Belgorod (large logistical hub afaik) with short ranges and they seem to have realized that the fortifications in the area was lacking. \n\nAlso, the Kharkiv area was liberated and to return \"once again\" caused shockwaves in at least international media. Russia is absolutely obsessed of steering/controlling narrative and their plans [in my opinion] often has a goal of altering the Information space. \n\nOn Kharkiv city: They absolutely want to take it, it would be both a major military victory *and* a massive Information space- victory. That said they are aware that it's a goal they can only achieve if UAF collapses in the area.
