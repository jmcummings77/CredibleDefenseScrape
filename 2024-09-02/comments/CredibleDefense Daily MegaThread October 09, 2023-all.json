As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

In particular, counterterrorism intelligence units thought that all these weapons used in this attack would be separately put into action in different attacks,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey could not make the assessment that kamikaze drones and their motorised parachutes, missiles, and mini drones would be used for a single all-out attack. Although I don&#39;t like to call this a weakness, intelligence made a huge mistake.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The colonel said that the relative stability in Gaza fostered great military indiscipline in the Israeli troops that served on the border.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is no logical explanation I can give to explain the sudden overrun of Israeli towns,\u201d he said. \u201dMaybe you should ask the government, which constantly interferes with the military.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The colonel added that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would have to attack Gaza with all his might, since politically he has no other choice.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt will take us at least 10 years to clean up this mess,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd for that to happen, Gaza should not cause us any major problems during that time. What to do for this is very clear: a major land and air operation.

Gazans don't really have cars by and large, and walking that distance would probably kill thousands and thousands. Secondly Egypt is a brutal secular military dictatorship whose main opposition is the Muslim Brotherhood, the same organization Hamas was originally a part of.

It's like a boiling cauldron: when there's space for more water to be added, you can turn up the flame while reducing the heat of the water. Can't do that when the cauldron is brimming. \n\nWhereas in Chechnya there was enough literal physical space for people to disperse - and in so doing, for hostile sentiment to disperse - in Gaza, there is nowhere for people to go. They live waist-deep in their poverty and their anger and in those conditions I just can't see the resentment diffusing away through sheer violence. Especially when you consider that that level of density makes massive civilian casualties unavoidable. Maybe you can break Hamas as an organization but other, more fractured groups will simply take its place and the violence will become even more stochastic and unpredictable. You could argue that this is outweighed by decreased operational effectiveness, but I don't think you can argue that the degree of resistance and violence straight up would be reduced.\n\nJust thinking off the top of my head. If you increased the population of Grozny by 10x and cordoned it off from the Chechen hinterland, I have to imagine the resistance would not have been so easily broken, at least without slaughtering 1M+ people.

In my opinion, two crucial distinctions are required. First, it is necessary to distinguish between Iranian support to Hamas, as well as the ongoing coordination between IRGC, Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (the \"Resistance Front\") and between the initiative, organization, and execution of the Hamas operation. While there is no doubt about the military cooperation between Iran and Hamas and Iran's increasing involvement in the Palestinian arena, including the West Bank, in recent years, I highly doubt whether Iran was significantly involved in Hamas's latest action. This is a Palestinian story. Did Hamas use Iranian aid? Definitely yes. Did Iran have an interest in this action? Yes.\n\n\n>Does Hamas need Iranian permission to operate? No. Was there early coordination between Hamas, Iran, and Hezbollah? It's possible. But, in the end, it is an action by Hamas based on it own interests arising from the Palestinian reality. My assessment is also supported by the recent statement of the IDF spokesman who said, \"Iran is a significant player, but we cannot say that it planned the operation or trained for it.\"\n\n\n>A second important distinction that is between the involvement of Iran (and Hezbollah) until the Hamas operation and what will happen from now on. In recent years, I shared the assessment that Iran has no interest in expanding the conflict between Israel and Hamas to other arenas through active participation (by itself and mainly through Hezbollah) during the occasional rounds of warfare between Israel and the Palestinians. I still believe that the concept according to which Iran has no interest in involving Hezbollah (which is considered by Tehran as a strategic tool to respond to a potential Israeli attack against Iran's nuclear facilities) is still relevant. However, we have recently witnessed at least three developments that may challenge the validity of this assessment:\n\n\n>A. The Hamas operation is a reality-changing event in the Middle East that may oblige Iran to move from the phase of ongoing support and coordination to a more direct involvement, especially if the Israeli response poses a significant challenge to Hamas.\n\n\n>B. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear to Iran that, with all due respect to the nuclear issue, a significant part of Israeli activity has been aimed at undermining the regional order and not only Iran's nuclear program. Therefore, Iran has been more committed to increase its involvement around Israeli borders (and even inside Israel) and perhaps is also prepared to pay a higher price for a possible confrontation with Israel, not only in the nuclear context.\n\n\n>C. Iran has practically positioned itself on the nuclear threshold and, at this stage, is not concerned with the possibility of Israeli military action except in the scenario (which does not seem likely at this stage) of a decision to break out to nuclear weapon. Therefore, Tehran may assess that using Hezbollah is no longer considered a \"waste of capabilities\" but a justified way to advance its strategic vision at the most convenient time. And so, in the bottom line, even assuming (as I do) that Iranian involvement in the implementation of the Hamas operation was not significant, I believe that the danger of escalating into an event involving Iran and Hezbollah has increased significantly.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RZimmt/status/1711335860170342865",

            "body": "Hamas has ruled Gaza since 2006, and the median age in Gaza is 19. The majority of Gazans have only lived in a country ruled by Hamas, and due to their control over the information space and their indoctrination of the Gazan people, many Gazans are literally unable to conceive of an alternative view aside from the dehumanization and murder of \"Israeli occupiers\".

While obviously bullshit, it\u2019s interesting how Russia is trying to profit from the chaos by siding with the Arabs on the one hand and accusing Ukraine on the other. This message is clearly directed at dumb Republicans. \n\nRussian propaganda works by scattershot, you fire off a dozen different conflicting claims and let the self-imposed echo-chambers of your audience filter out the ones that don't resonate. \n\nIf you're a communist Russia will tell you Ukrainians are greedy capitalists.

            "body": "Hashing out strategic intentions for an organisation like Hamas is difficult because Hamas is not a state and, therefore, it operates through means that are different than those of a state and bases its decisions on other concerns. It shares some goals with a state actor, and at its size, it mimics a state's organisation to some degree; it also runs a quasi-state entity in Gaza so it \"feels\" a lot like a state-level organisation that does state-level things, but some things don't apply to them equally.\n\nFor example:\n\n> It just seems such an incredibly risky move, and on balance the risks do not justify the potential gains. Their people will further suffer, their capability will be depleted, and there is no guarantee capitals across the Arab world will change their position, particularly given Hamas's close relations with Iran and Qatar. Further to that the absolute recklessness of their insurgents in committing atrocities and killing foreign nationals has withdrawn any willingness for the West to pressure Israel for restraint.\n\nIf Hamas were a country's government, primarily concerned with protecting its citizens, and whose primary means of ensuring support for its policy is the improvement of its population's quality of life, this would be 100% correct. However, Hamas is a militant organisation with a large terrorist wing that ended up running a country, for better or for worse. Some of these objectives are contradictory.\n\nFor example, if by some uncanny divine grace the people in the Middle East were to suddenly decide there's been enough killing and would overwhelmingly commit to lasting peace, a substantial number of Hamas militants would find themselves out of a job. Armed operations aren't \"just\" the means through which the military wing of Hamas pursues Hamas' wider goals, it's also the means through which military Hamas leaders advance their interests within the organisation. They are also inevitably under pressure to demonstrate that they use their funds efficiently, as Hamas depends significantly on foreign funds. So there is a significant internal incentive to apply violence: a military leader in a militant organisation who only uses armed action as a last resort won't get far, and is also not a model his superiors would want to promote, because if everyone gets to the point where violence is only the last resort, their power base will quickly dry up.\n\nSimilarly, a militant organisation that doesn't, well, militate, loses its recruitment base and its funds. Even Hamas' most active foreign sponsors, including Iran and Syria, *probably* don't want to see Hamas taking over Israel territory, expelling all Jews and running its own Palestinian state like thirty miles from Damascus. Nobody wants terrorists running a state next door to them. To them, it doesn't really matter if Hamas' actions aren't successful, but they do want them wrecking havoc. On the other hand, even a failed operation is not without value for Hamas. Their radicalised supporters, even in Europe, will ignore or rationalise their atrocities, whereas Israeli attacks will rally Hamas' supporters and donors and will drive recruitment for a while. This may not further their strategic goals but it does perpetuate their existence. There's an inherent imperative to acting in this manner.\n\nAnother difficulty of analysing this behaviour stems from the sheer commitment to a type of action, and from sheer matters of expertise. There may be better ways for Hamas to achieve its goals but Hamas is still first and foremost a terrorist organisation. This is the kind of operation that they know how to run, this is the kind of work through which they know to elicit political response. I know it sounds like some Hollywood-type \"terrorists gonna terrorise\" platitude but terrorist organisations are inclined to acts of terrorism just like government organisations are inclined to bureaucracy. What looks completely irrational to a normal, decent person may be treated far more leniently by someone who's inclined to view what they do as the one, only, and God-sanctioned solution, if only you do it well enough.\n\nFinally, there is a certain degree of \"futility\" in the struggle of every terrorist group. Many terror groups with a strong ideological component (Hamas is no exception) base their assessment of their future on a peculiar conception of time. The moment of the final battle for victory is, at once, almost upon us and far, far in the future. E.g. Ulrike Meinhof, in her (in)famous *Urban Guerilla* essay, writes:\n\n> The urban guerilla struggle is based on an understanding that there will be no Prussian-style marching orders, which so many so-called revolutionaries are waiting for to lead the people into revolutionary struggle. It is based on the analysis that *by the time the conditions are right for armed struggle, it will be too late to prepare for it*. It is based on the recognition that without revolutionary initiatives in a country with as much potential for violence as the Federal Republic, there will be no revolutionary orientation when the conditions for revolutionary struggle are more favorable, *as they soon will be given the political and economic developments of late capitalism*.\n\n(Emphasis mine). When Meinhof wrote this, Soviet and East German authorities were already getting squirrely about when the construction of communism would be completed, and every European communist lived both with the feeling that it was going to happen every minute now (after all, it had already happened in China, sort of -- something that Meinhof would've been particularly aware of) and the feeling that it may take so long they'll never see it with their own eyes.\n\nSimilarly, the degree to which some action aligns with a group's wider and more concrete strategic goals may not be *that* important when deciding whether to act or not. Externally, it may look like these acts were not just pointless, but likely counter-productive for the achievement of some specific goals we can suspect may have been pursued, like preventing Arab-Israeli reconciliation. But they are certainly in line with many of Hamas' other objectives, including the main ones -- the destruction of the state of Israel and the expelling of ethnic Jews from what they see as Arab territories.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Hashing out strategic intentions for an organisation like Hamas is difficult because Hamas is not a state and, therefore, it operates through means that are different than those of a state and bases its decisions on other concerns. It shares some goals with a state actor, and at its size, it mimics a state&#39;s organisation to some degree; it also runs a quasi-state entity in Gaza so it &quot;feels&quot; a lot like a state-level organisation that does state-level things, but some things don&#39;t apply to them equally.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It just seems such an incredibly risky move, and on balance the risks do not justify the potential gains. Their people will further suffer, their capability will be depleted, and there is no guarantee capitals across the Arab world will change their position, particularly given Hamas&#39;s close relations with Iran and Qatar. Further to that the absolute recklessness of their insurgents in committing atrocities and killing foreign nationals has withdrawn any willingness for the West to pressure Israel for restraint.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If Hamas were a country&#39;s government, primarily concerned with protecting its citizens, and whose primary means of ensuring support for its policy is the improvement of its population&#39;s quality of life, this would be 100% correct. However, Hamas is a militant organisation with a large terrorist wing that ended up running a country, for better or for worse. Some of these objectives are contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if by some uncanny divine grace the people in the Middle East were to suddenly decide there&#39;s been enough killing and would overwhelmingly commit to lasting peace, a substantial number of Hamas militants would find themselves out of a job. Armed operations aren&#39;t &quot;just&quot; the means through which the military wing of Hamas pursues Hamas&#39; wider goals, it&#39;s also the means through which military Hamas leaders advance their interests within the organisation. They are also inevitably under pressure to demonstrate that they use their funds efficiently, as Hamas depends significantly on foreign funds. So there is a significant internal incentive to apply violence: a military leader in a militant organisation who only uses armed action as a last resort won&#39;t get far, and is also not a model his superiors would want to promote, because if everyone gets to the point where violence is only the last resort, their power base will quickly dry up.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a militant organisation that doesn&#39;t, well, militate, loses its recruitment base and its funds. Even Hamas&#39; most active foreign sponsors, including Iran and Syria, <em>probably</em> don&#39;t want to see Hamas taking over Israel territory, expelling all Jews and running its own Palestinian state like thirty miles from Damascus. Nobody wants terrorists running a state next door to them. To them, it doesn&#39;t really matter if Hamas&#39; actions aren&#39;t successful, but they do want them wrecking havoc. On the other hand, even a failed operation is not without value for Hamas. Their radicalised supporters, even in Europe, will ignore or rationalise their atrocities, whereas Israeli attacks will rally Hamas&#39; supporters and donors and will drive recruitment for a while. This may not further their strategic goals but it does perpetuate their existence. There&#39;s an inherent imperative to acting in this manner.</p>\n\n<p>Another difficulty of analysing this behaviour stems from the sheer commitment to a type of action, and from sheer matters of expertise.

It's objectives are clear, so the first reflex should be to do the opposite of what they are trying to achieve. The deal with Saudi Arabia should therefore be fast-tracked and normalization with the Arab states should become a priority.\n\nAs for Gaza, the first step in any negotiation is to ensure the clock ticks against the opponent, not against you. Israel previously shirked away from building a litteral wall against Gaza because of money and ressources, but now it is justifiable. Crucial to this should be a 40 km long wall or fence in the sea off the coast of Gaza, to prevent ressupply by floating barrel or semi-submersible. Another important point to bring up is that Israel is in the process of fielding it's first laser weapons. One weapon system could easily be installed in a large airplane, circling over the Gaza strip. Not to go on a tangent about laser weapons, but there are A LOT of things you can do with even just a 100kw laser in the sky above. You can burn all the crops and vegetation in Gaza, as well as every solar panel, you can target the food in the stands at the marketplace. You can of course also target every weapon that is exposed in the open, as soon as it is taken out of hiding. And you can of course also individually zap every man standing in the open holding something that looks like an AK-47. None of that requires boots on the ground anymore, merely a plane in the sky watching the ground with a powerful telescope. Laser weapons are truly a revolutionary capability, and Israel could make use of it in this situation.\n\nPoint is: 2 million people is a heck of a lot of potential fighters to go through if you want to push into a concrete jungle from the ground, but it's also a lot of mouths to feed, especially if it suddenly becomes impossible to grow crops anywhere in Gaza, and Hamas is not immune to popular discontent either. Hamas will certainly find a way to feed it's soldiers through smuggling and tunnels, but it won't be possible to hide the logistics of feeding 2 million people through smuggling. And within that 2 million people, there is bound to be some that will be willing to undermine Hamas against a nice food package. In the best case scenario, civil unrest grips and weakens Gaza to the point where Hamas can be eliminated, in the worst case the population of Gaza shrinks. Literally starving it out is not very nice, but it's much better than to do the same *via* imfantry and airstrikes.",

He and his wife Sarai had been trying to conceive a child for years and years, until both had grown so old that it was clear Sarai was barren. So she told her husband to use her servant, Hagar, as a vessel to bear a child. She did; his name was Ishmael. Torah recounts that God's messenger told Hagar: \u202d\u202d\"[Ishmael] shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone\u2019s hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.\u201d \n\nYears later, according to Torah, Sara(h) was able to conceive a child of her own: Isaac. Ishmael, being older and only a half brother, is said to have had contempt for Isaac. Likewise, Hagar towards Sarah. So Sarah asked Abraham to send both Hagar and Ishmael away. He did.\n\nSome time later, Hagar is said to have prayed to the Abrahamic God. He responded by telling her her son would grow into a great nation of people. Likewise, God promised that a nation would come from Abraham, through the promised son Isaac.\n\nNow, why do I tell you this ancient Jerry Springer tale? Because the Jews trace their lineage through Isaac, and the 12 sons of Isaac's son, Jacob. Muslims, through the Quran, trace Arabic lineage through Ishmael, who is considered the ancestor of Mohammed himself. Christians trace the lineage of Jesus through Isaac as well.\n\nThis kind of story is the backbone of a cultural disparity that goes back thousands of years. I'm a Christian; I believe the account of the Bible is true. But most important for this sub, and the foreign policy of this region, is that this is the cultural framework that the Arabs and the Jews have **always had** for each other. Even if  Bibi isn't a hyperorthodox Jew, the cultural legacy of stories like this are ingrained in the very fabric of relationships between Jews and Arabs in this region. It is central to a complete understanding of the conflict, and the likelihood that a peaceable situation can ever be found where these groups live together in harmony.\n\nIgnore it if you wish, but your opinion is worthless without that knowledge.",

There is going to be limited amount of weapons and ammunition in Gaza strip.  Israel controls what goes in and out of this enclave.  Egypt is also no friend of Gaza.  I doubt they will help, given their military rulers receive aid from US, and US has firmly stood behind Israel.  What Hamas militants are using is what they are able to smuggle in.  We are not talking about 2nd amendment territory here.  Palestinians are fish in a barrel.</p>\n\n<p>By the time IDF goes in, the population would have been starved for days.  IDF can probably subjugate most of population just by handing out food, medicine, fuel, and other basic needs.</p>\n\n<p>Once Gaza population becomes tethered to IDF provided lifeline, they will be much more cooperative in 1) finding hostages, and 2) finding Hamas militants, and 3) finding information on who helped Hamas to plan this attack.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there likely will be &#39;peaceful&#39; protests and suicide bombing.  But I think IDF knows how to deal with this.</p>\n</div>",

We could say it would be urban warfare with drones and so on. We could say it would be like \"pick a larger ISIS held city and its siege and it would be like that\" but all of these are probably wrong.\n\nGaza is already encircled and I am pretty sure that Israel will tighten that a lot more.\n\nIt isnt preparing for a siege for months, it is preparing for it for decades.\n\nThey have very large foreign supporters (compered to what ISIS had for example) and many arabs-islamists are supporting them. Even westerners are sympathetic thanks to what they roleplay in that media as palestinian freedom fighters (I would like to say that in this case they are obviously want to destroy Israel whatever the consequences, so I wouldnt/couldnt call them \"freedom fighters\")\n\nHowever the IDF probably has been planning this as a contingency for a few years as well and we can be sure that some very high level and restricted folders are being opened. Pretty sure that cutting the water was the first step in many of them.\n\nThis fight, if they want to push into Gaza and \"eradicate hamas\", will be complex and we have no chance to forecast it, neither does the brass of IDF and leaders of hamas. It will probably be a shitfest. We shall se how the IDF wants to play it because of their capabilities and the current situation, the ball is in their hand and they have a few ways to go about it. Knowing the Israelis, my bet is the \"\"\"humane genocide\"\"\" something like the Azerbajianies did to NK. I doubt that they will be go in guns blazing. They just never really give back \"the ball\" to hamas.\n\n- What does a standard Israeli battalion consist of?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces\n\n- How is Hamas going to attempt to defend the city? Are women and children going to fight?\n\nIf we took a look at history, it tells us that they gonna use everything they have. Human shields, bombs, drones, anything and everything that they can do. Woman and children fighting is a maybe, but not incomprehensible. Child soldiers are nothing new and you can for sure radicalize little children there. Recruitment probably starts subconciously at a very young age.\n\n- Given that water is now cut off - how long do we expect supplies to last? I feel this is the time limiting factor in a siege of Gaza.\n\nCutting of water was probably been the choice cause it will be the fastest to bring results. I have no idea of Gaza and its possible reserves, watermaker options and such, but. In a modern western city that is corridored of this would start to cause serious problems in a few days. My guess 2-5 days, If I need to pick. 3.\n\n- Will a ground invasion by IDF trigger a Hezbollah response? Where could/would Hezbollah likely respond from?\n\nProbably, at this point its hard to decide if they are probing with the freshea news or just can't hold their fanatics back. Depends on Israel response but I would put my money here on a yes. The nature of the response would be the Hezbollah response. Terror attacks, morter fire and maybe lile incursions, but more like infiltrators trying to destroy social cohesion and order and murder as many civiliams as they can.\n\nI had a discussion about possible \"mass murder terror attacks\" last year here. There are some truely terrible options. Worst and more deadly then what we saw here. I can only hope that the Israelis are on guard and that noone is that derranged. Sadly, I know that there are probably a few fanatics who are. Lets hope for the best.",

                            "body": "The largest driving factors is allowing Palestinians to work in Israel creating much higher income streams than any neighboring Arab country. \n\n>According to the PCBS, in 2021 the average monthly salary of workers in the construction sector in the West Bank was 3,193 [Israeli] shekels, as opposed to 7,627 shekels for a worker in the construction sector in the Israeli market\n\nhttps://palwatch.org/page/30760\n\nUp till recently Isarel subsidized power to the WB and about 1/3 of the power to Gaza as well.\n\nAs for health, Israel treats Palestinians:\n\n>However, despite ongoing terror threats, and even during unrest and wars, many Palestinians do pass daily into Israel for medical care. Israeli hospitals have long provided Palestinians with extensive medical services. For example, during the research period (in 2005 alone), approximately 123\u2009000 Palestinians were treated at just one institution, Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, which included 15\u2009000 admissions as well as 32\u2009000 visits to the emergency department.\n\n>general, special entry permits are issued in humanitarian cases for ill people, their chaperones, and for Palestinian medical teams.

Maintaining a calm, objective tone and focusing on the facts does tend to win out over time, though, so I encourage people to keep posting even in the face of at times unpredictable voting behavior. \n\nThat said, I have also noticed a a marked increase in what I suspect is illicit vote manipulation behavior, which thankfully has in general been quite ineffective, at least from what I can tell. For example, I've noticed increasing numbers of relatively neutral, well-justified posts that spend an unusually long period of time in \"controversial\" territory when the total vote count remains low, before reverting to the sub's mean voting patterns as early votes are overwhelmed by the sub's majority and/or when Reddit's anti-manipulation algorithms start to discount early sock puppet votes. I specifically have noticed this pattern occurring with posts that generally fit the sub's tone and standards while not presenting any especially controversial opinions, at least by the sub's historical standards. It's possible similar manipulation has been happening to promote more conspiratorial and less credible takes in general, so it's good that we should all be on guard against motivated parties attempting to manipulate the discourse here.\n\nI'm not sure if there is a good answer to the problem other than recommending that people do not rely on upvotes as a metric of credibility or correctness, especially for comments with small absolute numbers of votes, and instead that they should engage with the reasoning and sources which commenters present. Personally, I don't care about my karma and will happily keep having intelligent conversations in the presence of absurd and possibly illicit voting behavior, although I understand it can be discouraging to witness in practice and we as a mod team will of course do our best to limit the conspiratorial nonsense and promote the more serious discussions we all value here.",

Whether or not it actually affected the 2016 election, the Russian disinformation campaign in favor of Trump certainly made a strong case for nefarious actors to invest heavily in internet disinformation campaigns in general. I don't think we are receiving sufficiently specialized attention that it is actually affecting the sub, but certainly we get blasted with the same bots that show up everywhere. The mod team enforcing our tighter contribution standards and our somewhat more stringent auto-mod settings remove many of those posts before anyone sees them, thankfully. \n\nAlso I think we are probably the most active serious defense-focused subreddit (and we receive outsized attention to some extent because of our close nominal relationship with the largest defense-focused subreddit, which is NCD). But that probably makes us one of the largest such public forums on the internet, at least in the Anglosphere.\n\nAlso, we may be under 100k subs, but we are still in the top 2% of subreddits by subs and we are certainly in the top five or ten defense-focused subs, behind /r/NCD, /r/military, /r/combatfootage, and maybe a couple others. Yet we are significantly more active than those subs too (except NCD). [Take the rankings from this website, subredditstats.com](https://subredditstats.com/r/credibledefense). They put us at 775th subreddit for most comments per day, except they are dramatically undercounting comments on this sub, perhaps by excluding the daily megathread. They list us as having 174 comments per day when we generally average between 300 and 400 just for the megathread, very rarely dropping below 200 and often spiking well above 500. Often we see days with many more comments than those averages, such as this weekend when there were over a thousand comments each day. A mere 350 comments per day would put us in the top 250 subreddits according to subredditstats.com. The days where we spike above 1000 put us into contention with the top 50 subs.\n\nI also do not doubt that savvy media manipulators recognize that targeting highly engaged individuals can provide an outsized return on investment for a propaganda campaign. That's precisely why media companies started paying Instagram influencers to advertise, for example. Shifting the debate in a forum like CD can affect discussions elsewhere on Reddit by influencing the opinions of the people most likely to engage actively with political, defense-related issues across a wide array of subreddits. I notice frequent posters from here commenting on /r/CombatFootage, /r/LessCredibleDefense, /r/Ukraine, /r/UkraineConflict, and /r/NonCredibleDefense all the time.\n\nThe same effect likely occurs across the wider information space even, because people who engage with content here no doubt also participate in discussions on other social media channels and forums, whether it's a small discord server with a few friends or tweeting at major media figures or their local political Facebook group or whatever else. I know my tweets have been liked and retweeted by some of the larger OSINT accounts, for example, and my perspective is certainly shaped by the discussions here.\n\nI've also frequently observed arguments made here on the daily megathread slowly percolate their way into the mass media, which either means we are often ahead of the curve, or to some extent the discussion here does affect the thinking of mainstream, recognized experts who provide analysis to major media outlets. Whether that's because there are members of the media directly reading or participating here, because of more indirect influence through multiple degrees of separation where friends of such media personas participate here, or because of coincidental convergence between our analysis and more traditional media's, I can't say for sure. I do know that if I were designing an influence campaign around something related to defense or international relations designed to affect an American or even just an English-language audience, I would certainly target Reddit, and I would certainly target a broad range of subs beyond the most obvious ones relating to my objective. Fewer people are on guard against Russian propaganda on /r/MapPorn than on /r/Ukraine, for example. So I would actually specifically focus on mid-sized subs like CD, because it is easier to shift the narrative on a smaller sub than on a larger sub. An influence campaign targeting a few large subs can easily get drowned out by actual users and therefore it is more expensive to achieve the same propaganda effect as a campaign that targets a larger number of smaller subs can achieve.\n\nEdit: fun story about how strict our automod is.

I&#39;m trying to show you how daft your logic is by demonstrating that it would lead you to conclusions that are clearly ridiculous and with which you would disagree. But intentional or otherwise, this is beyond your comprehension.</p>\n</div>",
