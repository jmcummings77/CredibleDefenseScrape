They could have the ammo but not the guns. We don't know where the bottleneck is; if there's a shortage of both, or a shortage of neither and a logistics/strategic decision instead. So, with the power outages, they could be moving the guns to the front slower, or maybe they're massing for a push in Zap. The latter being more unlikely. Or maybe their logistics arm is just messing up royally. \n\nAlso, from your comment below on the Pzh 2000, it does seem like there's a shortage of total barrels. They have a total of ~250 155mm artillery pieces, and they've been given at least (if not more) a million 155mm shells. The bulk of the 155m artillery shipments started around May, but most weren't announced until June/July. That would imply a usage rate of 5.5k shells/day. Which is higher than any estimate I've seen from a credible source for Ukrainian expenditure rates on a prolonged basis. Even more drastic specially when say 1/4 of the guns are out for maintenance at any given time? Anecdotally as well, watching CNN, Channel 4, Sky, RFERL video reports, the artillery commanders that are interviewed are saying they're getting closer to parity with the Russians recently. \n\nEither way, Kofman's point may be more about \"Russia needs to spend that much artillery in order to hold land, while Ukraine doesn't\", and not an actual readout on relative artillery ammo replacement rates.",

Just before the invasion the bids were taken up by two justices that were closely tied to Yanukovych himself and were only dismissed after Russia aborted their attempt to seize Kiev. The reason for their dismissal was a technicality that should have prevented the cases from being taken up in the first place.\n\nThis is interesting because the details of Russia's plan had the invasion gone as planned is still a matter of speculation. I think the most likely scenario was one where Yanukovych was reinstalled as President of a Ukrainian government that becomes a signatory to the Union State treaty. The timing of the court cases, the alleged presence of Yanukovych in Minsk  at the start of the invasion, and various comments by Russian and Belarussian officials about strengthening the Union State seem to suggest this. Not to mention Putin has repeatedly claimed Yanukovych to be the legitimate President of Ukraine. \n\nHowever, what I find very difficult to reconcile is the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent on February 21. At this point, the Kremlin had every reason to believe that the invasion would be successful. If it were, and Yanukovych reinstalled as President, I cannot see him accepting the independence of Donbas. He would have had no choice but to accept losing Crimea. Losing Donbas on top of it would likely be a bridge too far. Not only is he actually from Donbas, but losing it as well as Crimea would leave him with virtually no base of power. It would be like asking a Republican to be President of a US that didn't include Texas and Alabama. \n\nOf course, you could say that Donetsk and Luhansk were to be reintegrated into Ukraine once Yanukovych was reinstalled. If that were the case why recognize them at all? \n\nI think the likely answer to this is something that is becoming all the more apparent: Putin is a masterclass in procrastination. Rather than the machiavellian figure he had built a reputation as, he really doesn't plan things out all that well. He likely didn't have a solid vision for what to do with Ukraine had his Special Military Operation been successful.",

Yeah, he's back.   \n\n> And now also briefly on the impressions from the trip, which was fruitless, but not useless (because my eyes and ears were still with me, and my brain is also still working).\n> \n> Naturally, overwhelmingly-most of my impressions and conclusions I intend to keep to myself. Not to \"discredit \", so to speak. Positive impressions - I will share in the upcoming (I hope) video-conferences. But there are not too many of them - in relation to the negative ones.\n> \n> For now I will only note that at the heart of all our \"mounting victories\" on the fronts and directions of the SMO is the deepest crisis of strategic planning. Simply put, the troops are fighting \"by inertia\" without the slightest idea of the final strategic goals of the current military campaign and only guessing about the command's vague plans for such grandiose and senseless moves as the construction of the totally useless (but wildly expensive in cost) Surovikin Line.\n> \n> In most Russian Armed Forces units soldiers and officers do not understand what for and the purpose for which they are fighting. For them it is a mystery, what is a condition for victory or merely a condition for termination of the war? And the authorities of the Russian Federation are not capable of explaining this to them, because setting a clear goal of the SMO means \"limiting maneuvering space\" - that is, depriving themselves of the possibility to declare the goals of the SMO achieved at any moment that the Kremlin leaders will consider convenient for themselves.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Strelkov just made another post sharing some of his impressions. Yeah, he&#39;s back.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now also briefly on the impressions from the trip, which was fruitless, but not useless (because my eyes and ears were still with me, and my brain is also still working).</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, overwhelmingly-most of my impressions and conclusions I intend to keep to myself. Not to &quot;discredit &quot;, so to speak. Positive impressions - I will share in the upcoming (I hope) video-conferences. But there are not too many of them - in relation to the negative ones.</p>\n\n<p>For now I will only note that at the heart of all our &quot;mounting victories&quot; on the fronts and directions of the SMO is the deepest crisis of strategic planning. Simply put, the troops are fighting &quot;by inertia&quot; without the slightest idea of the final strategic goals of the current military campaign and only guessing about the command&#39;s vague plans for such grandiose and senseless moves as the construction of the totally useless (but wildly expensive in cost) Surovikin Line.</p>\n\n<p>In most Russian Armed Forces units soldiers and officers do not understand what for and the purpose for which they are fighting. For them it is a mystery, what is a condition for victory or merely a condition for termination of the war? And the authorities of the Russian Federation are not capable of explaining this to them, because setting a clear goal of the SMO means &quot;limiting maneuvering space&quot; - that is, depriving themselves of the possibility to declare the goals of the SMO achieved at any moment that the Kremlin leaders will consider convenient for themselves.

I suppose it &quot;works&quot; if your intent is to increase suicide rates.</p>\n\n<p>The simple reality is we know things will get worse, but we have no idea how bad &quot;worse&quot; will be. It&#39;s not great, but your certainty about vastly complex factors and results stretching out decades into the future is entirely groundless.</p>\n</div>",

This winter there will likely be a number of deaths due to exposure to cold, and that is the result of a comparatively minor shift in energy consumption patterns. Drastic short term change in power infrastructure would necessitate immense socioeconomic adjustments, likely more dramatic than those implemented in the US during WW2; that was during a state of *total war*. One might think of the Chinese government as being capable of such drastic changes, but its per capita carbon emissions have increased [year-over-year since 2015](https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/china).

It's very frustrating, but I regard this collective behavior as natural as ecology.

China has slowly become more expensive to work in, and the CCP has forced US companies into an increasingly uncomfortable political position. Most companies don\u2019t like working with China, they do it because it\u2019s cheap and there is a ton of infrastructure. But as wages rise, places like Vietnam look better and better.

You can also play into this nationalistic sentiments, for Xi economic nationalism dovetails with domestic economic stability. \n\nSo in some ways it\u2019s a divorce.

An interesting anecdote about the Ratnik armor I think helps highlight what youre asking about. Apparently in 2017 the Russian army bought 200k uniforms (including plates and webbing) at a price to them of $3.5k a pop. Many were taken, stolen, out of the warehouse and ended up selling on Russian eBay for $500 or less. The RUSI report, and others, paint a picture of this as being a pretty well organized and hierarchical set of theft groups. Often enlistedmen in depots and supply situations are ordered by superiors, including the dreaded NCO corps, to loot equipment. Then the upper management sells it to net a profit, which is then distributed among the coconspiritors based on rank. Conscripts do the bulk of the work, the NCO corps enforces adherence to the scheme through frequent and often brutal discipline, so that he and the officers in positions of responsibility can pocket their shares of the sales. \n\nBut that also means that this kind of corruption is systemic and well entrenched in the system. A certain portion of long-service officers and NCOs are there so they can profit off the sale of RUAF equipment, there is decent money in it (you pay your labor nothing, the state does, so you can sell goods which cost you nothing, the state paid for it). If you sell 20 plate carriers a month, thats $10k USD untaxed in a place where the average salary is like $15k per *year*. Add that to your offical army salary and suddenly you go from a below standard career to a top earner. Youre also responsible for about 250 carriers a year going missing, or (our fictional NCO) 1250 carriers since 2017 when they were introduced, and out of an initial order of 200k. \n\nBut when this kind of corruption becomes systemic, who knows what greasy shit guys can do for a payday. Russia has long unpoliced borders, and if you can get the leadership of an entire supply depot behind selling artillery rounds to some buyer, it wouldnt be hard to get trucks and offical paperwork drawn up to cover all that. When you have buy in from the mid level management, it goes beyond some guy selling plate carriers on eBay hoping he doesnt get caught (I bet that even happens in the US). You can get trucks (you can sell trucks!) driven by conscripts carrying offical documents driving all over hell and creation doing god knows what with equipment that ought to be sitting in a depot somewhere waiting for a situation just like this one. \n\nCombating this kind of corruption is also really hard because you have to tear it out root and branch, and that often comes with tearing out the spine of your entire army. Like the guys doing all this theft are probably *the* guys who know where the Russian army's equipment actually is, what condition its in, how much of what is really available. You can hope that a showy trial with a harsh sentence will help tap down on the problem, but its very hard to ask someone to go from living in wealth and comfort to managing on a SGTs salary. Which is why these issues are often so hard to make go away.",

            "body": "Quoted from u/Duncan-M\n\nConsidering the time frame when Mariupol was encircled, and how chaotic things were, I don't think the UAF GenStab were so forward thinking that they allowed numerous brigades to be wiped out (there was no indication then they would be released in POW exchanges) to buy some time resisting an assault that was no guarantee to even occur. \n\nWhat was stopping the Russians from doing a Dunkirk '44-5  instead of a Brest? It actually made more sense not to immediately assault the city, a cordon around it would have trapped them until such time an assault was needed (if it was). \n\nCheck out [these maps](https://militaryland.net/maps/invasion-maps/mariupol-front/). Any retreat would needed to have been ordered from the GenStab to OC-E to the units in Mariupol at least by March 6 (day 10), because it would have taken days to organize and conduct a retreat, and the last road out was cut by day 13. Now compare that day 13 Mariupol map to the [Ukraine day 13](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_fullmaps/day_13_fullmap.png). Now let's skip ahead until the actual assault started between [day 20](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_fullmaps/day_20_fullmap.png)/Mar 15 when the actual assault started. The Russians are making a pretty good bit of progress north. Skip ahead to [Day 30](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_fullmaps/day_30_fullmap.png), about the point when Putin made the decision to allow retreats, and most of Zaporizhzhia oblast was gobbled up along with more of Donetsk too. \n\nAs it happened, I'm pretty sure the assault on the city was only ordered because the Russians didn't realize the challenge and length of time it would take to clear it.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Quoted from <a href=\"/u/Duncan-M\">u/Duncan-M</a></p>\n\n<p>Considering the time frame when Mariupol was encircled, and how chaotic things were, I don&#39;t think the UAF GenStab were so forward thinking that they allowed numerous brigades to be wiped out (there was no indication then they would be released in POW exchanges) to buy some time resisting an assault that was no guarantee to even occur. </p>\n\n<p>What was stopping the Russians from doing a Dunkirk &#39;44-5  instead of a Brest? It actually made more sense not to immediately assault the city, a cordon around it would have trapped them until such time an assault was needed (if it was). </p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/maps/invasion-maps/mariupol-front/\">these maps</a>. Any retreat would needed to have been ordered from the GenStab to OC-E to the units in Mariupol at least by March 6 (day 10), because it would have taken days to organize and conduct a retreat, and the last road out was cut by day 13. Now compare that day 13 Mariupol map to the <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_fullmaps/day_13_fullmap.png\">Ukraine day 13</a>. Now let&#39;s skip ahead until the actual assault started between <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_fullmaps/day_20_fullmap.png\">day 20</a>/Mar 15 when the actual assault started. The Russians are making a pretty good bit of progress north. Skip ahead to <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/wp-content/gallery/invasion_2022_fullmaps/day_30_fullmap.png\">Day 30</a>, about the point when Putin made the decision to allow retreats, and most of Zaporizhzhia oblast was gobbled up along with more of Donetsk too. </p>\n\n<p>As it happened, I&#39;m pretty sure the assault on the city was only ordered because the Russians didn&#39;t realize the challenge and length of time it would take to clear it. By the time they did they were committed to the point if they slowed down or switched to a legit siege it would be publicly viewed as a defeat, something Putin et al weren&#39;t willing to accept  after the Kyiv-Chernihiv-Sumy retreat. </p>\n\n<p>That said, watching videos of Russians clearing the city, knowing issues they have with culture, organization, etc, the lack of urban warfare training, and the heavy use of L/DNR barely trained conscripts, I was still surprised at the level of caution they used clearing the city.

Apparently McCarthy is leading the charge on this issue.\n\nSince we so often do strategic theory for Russia, I\u2019ll do some for the US. I think McCarthy has picked this fight very intentionally. If he can get the White House to back down on the mandate (which, tbh, is probably less political important in our post-COVID world) that\u2019s a big win on an important issue to the base. That shows the rest of the Caucus that McCarthy can lead and win, and helps shore up his leadership bid which people are predicting will be contentious. Of course if McCarthy loses, he is fueling challenges from both the moderate and radical wings. And of course the White House and Senate have an interest in resisting McCarthys bullying, he ultimately has a pretty weak position. \n\nHow this plays into our discussions here: there has been a lot of debate about whether or not McCarthy would challenge Ukraine funding. The NDAA is obviously got some important funds for Ukraine in it. So he\u2019s already started politicizing Ukraine funding. But this also to me is setting the pattern that McCarthy, if retained as Speaker, will try to politicize these pretty standard votes. He\u2019s going to use basically any lever he can to try and signal to his base in Congress that he\u2019s on their side, and I don\u2019t think anything for him is going to be held sacred. If the NDAA ends up having a bumpy passage, I can\u2019t imagine a Ukraine bill will do better. We\u2019re just one crisis within McCarthys caucus away from cuts to Ukraine support. \n\nI personally think McCarthy for better or worse will be elected Speaker even though I would prefer a coalition government. I think a moderate Republican Speaker would be able to command the House for the next two years to the profit of both sides (and, like, the nation or whatever). But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s very likely. Regardless I think the Speakership vote is going to be big in terms of US support. \n\nI wonder if all the talk about negotiation can be read in this light.
