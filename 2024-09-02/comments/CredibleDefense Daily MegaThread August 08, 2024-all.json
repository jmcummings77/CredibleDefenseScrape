        "body": "Brief update on the order of battle of the offensive operations in Kursk Oblast (without mentioning the advances and the current status from a tactical point of view), in addition to what I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1em9xjs/comment/lh0nd10/) yesterday in response to u/Usual_Diver_4172.\n\nIt's not easy to perfectly identify the units involved in this first phase, for several imaginable reasons; moreover, MIA notices have yet to come out. But let's try.\n\nOn the Ukrainian side, elements of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade, of the 80th and (perhaps) of the 82nd Air Assault Brigades are likely leading the actions. In the first case (22nd), we knew that this brigade had been moved to Sumy Oblast and the Russian MoD has been stating since August 6 that the attacks were started by this unit. In the second case (80th), it's the only maneuver unit of which we currently have an official confirmation, from Ukrainian sources, showing it being committed in the sector (in my opinion its 1st and/or 2nd Battalions, previously engaged in Klishchiivka). This could be an explanation for the recent removal of the commander of the 80th Air Assault Brigade (Ishkulov), who perhaps disagreed with this plan (he was replaced by the former commander of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, Rozlach). Kriegsforscher seems to [agree] (https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1820729677708767260) with this theory. In the third case (82nd), the Marders we saw might belong to them, at least if they have not recently been assigned to other brigades we are not aware about. There is then the \"Nakhtihal\" Unit of the 14th Regiment of Unmanned Drones. The presence of Strike UAV units is absolutely essential to inflict maximum damage on the enemy and intercept/hit movements of reinforcements.\n\nhttps://t. me/DeepStateUA/20086\n\n\"Khorne Group\", the UAV unit of the 116th Mech Brigade, released a video showing Ukrainian vehicles moving inside Russian territory, describing them as \"our vehicles\". It is unclear whether they meant our in the sense of Ukrainians or in the sense of belonging to the 116th Mech Brigade, which was/is in the Kupyansk sector. \n\nhttps://t. me/khornegroup/2411 \n\nSpecial forces units are probably providing support and operate as reconnaissance groups. The new 152nd Mech Brigade (it was the only one among the five brigades created in late 2023 that had never been committed so far) has likely recently arrived in Sumy Oblast, as far as I [could find](https://i.imgur.com/vGBCXRj.png), but it may be covering the border elsewhere and not be directly involved.\n\nInterestingly, the tactical marking used by the Ukrainians right now is the same one that had been seen on vehicles (e.g. Kozak-2 IMVs) of the 13th Jager Brigade, in late June, during some tensions with Belarus. This brigade had been created a year and a half ago but was never directly committed along the front - it has been covering the border with Belarus. Of course, that doesn't mean it is involved in these actions, and that tactical marking could be adopted by units operating on the northern front in general.\n\nhttps://t. me/milinfolive/125264\n\nProbably TDF units were brought in to consolidate gains in the rear and begin fortifications works: digging, woodworking, etc. Let's recall that quite a lot of company and platoon strongpoints were captured. Russian sources report that in Sudzha the Ukrainians are setting up firing points inside the buildings.\n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1687\n\nSmall update on the Pokrovsk sector too: in addition to the reinforcements we saw yesterday (although I'm still not sure about the 88th Mech Brigade), the 14th \"Chervona Kalyna\" Brigade of the National Guard is being transferred there from the Orikhiv sector, possibly along with elements of the 28th Mech Brigade (in this case from the Chasiv Yar sector). \n\nOn the Russian side, we know that there were detachments of the Border Service and battalions of conscripts in the area (who saw the bulk of the fighting and surrendered in large numbers, by the standards of this conflict). The Russian Telegram channel \u201cNorthern Channel\u201d, run by servicemen of the Group of Forces \u201cNorth\u201d, reported today that in the eastern outskirts of Sudzha a battalion of the 488th Motorized Regiment (144th Motorized Division, 20th CAA) - almost certainly the one made up of conscripts and detached from the rest of the regiment - and one of the \"102nd Brigade\" are at risk of getting surrounded. It's not entirely clear what this unit is; it's possible it is the 102nd Special Purpose Brigade of the Rosgvardia. \n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1684\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian observer Mashovets, battalions of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps and of the 128th Motorized Brigade of the 44th Corps, which were in the rear of the Kharkiv sector as tactical reserves (while the rest of their units were committed), are being hastily transferred to Kursk Oblast.\n\nhttps://t. me/zvizdecmanhustu/2101\n\nThe GoF \"North\", at the time offensive operations began, according to Ukrainian estimates, could count on 72/75 thousand servicemen, 320/350 tanks, 760/770 armored fighting vehicles, 800/820 artillery guns (\u2265100mm, including mortars) and 150/160 MLRS systems. These figures are, though, to a very large extent concentrated in Belgorod Oblast. \n\nhttps://t. me/zvizdecmanhustu/2098\n\nThe 45th Spetsnaz VDV Brigade, i.e. on paper the most elite brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, is on its way to Kursk. A channel affiliated with the 106th VDV Division denied (in the comments) rumors about the arrival of the latter formation, but confirmed the transfer of the 45th Brigade. \n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_106/1257\n\nAccording to Russian sources, the recon battalion of the 45th Spetsnaz VDV Brigade had already been brought into action in July in the Hlyboke area (Kharkiv sector). So far, however, the bulk of the brigade was in the Kamyanske sector.\n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1554\n\nThe commander of the \"Akhmat Special Forces\", Apti Alaudinov, stated that Chechen units defending the border were unable to prevent the Ukrainian advance as the latters \"passed\" Chechen strongholds. \n\nhttps://t. me/banki_oil/21423\n\nRussian sources are extremely critical with the perfomance of Kadyrovites. In the area there should be the \"Akhmat-Zapad\" Battalion; the 349th Regiment (\"Akhmat-Russia\") and the 1434th Regiment (\"Akhmat-Chechnya\") of the Territorial Forces. These units, unlike others in the \"Akhmat\" galaxy (such as those I will list below), are composed largely of ethnic Chechens.\n\nToday the 204th \"Aida\" Regiment of the \"Akhmat Special Forces\" arrived from Vovchansk (where the \"Kamerton\" Detachment, formed by former Wagnerites, is deployed too); together, according to Russian sources, with the new \"Iskra\" Detachment, created in April by a former commander of the 1st Assault Detachment of PMC Wagner (Ratibor), who joined the \"Akhmat Special Forces\".\n\nhttps://t. me/RVvoenkor/74297\n\nhttps://t. me/condottieros/4868\n\nRecall that the 22nd Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division of the 44th Corps is the only regiment of the division that had not been committed yet and was rumored to be going into action at Hlyboke, by Russian sources. At this point, it could be taking... other routes. In the Grayvoron area moreover there are elements of the 245th Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division (1st GTA) and of the 11th Tank Brigade (25th CAA), subunits of both of which were involved in the unsuccessful attacks on Sotnytskyi Kozachok over thre last month. Moreover, in Kursk Oblast there should be elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, as we had seen yesterday.\n\nMinor units such as the \"ArBat\" Battalion and the \"Pyatnashka\" Brigade (formally the 3rd Battalion of the 87th Rifle Regiment of the Mobilization Reserve of the 51st CAA - the former 1st Corps) have reportedly arrived in Kursk today.\n\nhttps://t. me/arbat_pyatnashka/780\n\nhttps://t. me/diviziya15/342\n\nI would not rule out the arrival of special forces from the GRU, Rosgvardia or FSB. In case of future problems the Russians might also send, in my opinion, elements of the 76th VDV Division and the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade, which are deployed, however, in Southern Ukraine at the moment.",

In the area there should be the &quot;Akhmat-Zapad&quot; Battalion; the 349th Regiment (&quot;Akhmat-Russia&quot;) and the 1434th Regiment (&quot;Akhmat-Chechnya&quot;) of the Territorial Forces. These units, unlike others in the &quot;Akhmat&quot; galaxy (such as those I will list below), are composed largely of ethnic Chechens.</p>\n\n<p>Today the 204th &quot;Aida&quot; Regiment of the &quot;Akhmat Special Forces&quot; arrived from Vovchansk (where the &quot;Kamerton&quot; Detachment, formed by former Wagnerites, is deployed too); together, according to Russian sources, with the new &quot;Iskra&quot; Detachment, created in April by a former commander of the 1st Assault Detachment of PMC Wagner (Ratibor), who joined the &quot;Akhmat Special Forces&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/RVvoenkor/74297</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/condottieros/4868</p>\n\n<p>Recall that the 22nd Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division of the 44th Corps is the only regiment of the division that had not been committed yet and was rumored to be going into action at Hlyboke, by Russian sources. At this point, it could be taking... other routes. In the Grayvoron area moreover there are elements of the 245th Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division (1st GTA) and of the 11th Tank Brigade (25th CAA), subunits of both of which were involved in the unsuccessful attacks on Sotnytskyi Kozachok over thre last month. Moreover, in Kursk Oblast there should be elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, as we had seen yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>Minor units such as the &quot;ArBat&quot; Battalion and the &quot;Pyatnashka&quot; Brigade (formally the 3rd Battalion of the 87th Rifle Regiment of the Mobilization Reserve of the 51st CAA - the former 1st Corps) have reportedly arrived in Kursk today.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/arbat_pyatnashka/780</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/diviziya15/342</p>\n\n<p>I would not rule out the arrival of special forces from the GRU, Rosgvardia or FSB. In case of future problems the Russians might also send, in my opinion, elements of the 76th VDV Division and the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade, which are deployed, however, in Southern Ukraine at the moment.</p>\n</div>",

It appears that Ukraine has been focusing on giving up land where necessary to inflict losses on Russia while minimizing Ukrainian losses.  If that is your strategic goal (land for Russian attrition) there are limited ways to win a goal only to defend against heavily armed and prepared forces.\n\nAs Sun Tsu noted the folly of attacking an enemy's strength versus its weakness.  Russia had only two lightly defended lines by conscripts in this area and limited resources to respond.  I've heard some reports that this operation has been in preparation for quite a while and interestingly the information from the Ukrainian side has been very very limited and most of the information we are receiving is from Russian milbloggers.  Not even the deepstate/live maps are being updated.\n\nSo back to the question credible to attack Russia here as a bargaining chip.  Could that solely be the reason?  No, not really because I don't recall any wise/seasoned military officials choosing to create a military operation for an abstract reason such as \"we might need land later\", but it does make total sense in what the operation to get land achieves.\n\n1. Forces Russian forces to hastily respond to the incursion that will result in **heavier losses for Russians** that can in turn give way to more land.\n2. Ukraine has breached the two border defense lines and **when there are no more defense lines between your enemy's regional capital, it creates panic.**\n3. You have forces/equipment prepared in a region ready to respond to whatever your enemy sends to plug the gap, this means either Russia has to send whatever it can as it can (not efficient) or it has to lose undefended ground while it musters a proper response of forces and planning.\n4. Russia must move reinforcements and possibly pause other operations to deal with the incursion, this opens up the opportunity for long-range strikes on rear bases where Russian forces are concentrated leaving an area or arriving.\n5. The incursion area is closer to Western-defended airfields allowing the Ukrainian Air Force to operate more freely (including the newer F-16's).\n6. The success or failure (if Ukraine decides, once Russia has deployed enough forces, to retreat) Russia will now have to not only move more manpower along its entire Ukrainian border - but most **importantly move engineering battalions to create better defense lines from Ukraine to Russia.** This can be huge for Ukraine in retaking or not losing ground elsewhere.\n7. Strategic roads/rail can be captured messing up Russian logistics even as close as Kharkiv, some speculate there is a Russian NPP that could be traded for Zaphoriza, but I'm not so sure about that.\n8. Pushing into Russia allows Ukraine to **build better defensive lines behind right on the Ukraine/Russia border**, something that led to the Kharkiv incursion.  This buys more freedom for engineers to build/dig further from artillery bombardment.\n8. Psychological shock for the Russian military and civilians.  This shock doesn't have to be done for the purpose of \"breaking the will\" but can force unwise decisions that they otherwise would not have committed to.\n9. Prestige, just like having oil refineries strike thousands of km from the front line or a drone on the Kremlin, these all damage Russian prestige.\n\nWith these considerations, the possible goal of a land swap is just a strategic byproduct of the combination of all the other goals.  I would say that once all the above have been achieved Ukraine simply won't abandon the land, but they won't likely defend it as harshly as they will for their own.",

        "body": "Based on information collated by Radio Liberty from mostly RU milbloggers (Rybar, Dva Mayora) and civilian photos, there is an expectation from unofficial Russian sources (narrative presented by Rybar) that Ukrainian forces in Kursk are attempting to advance to Rylsk and Lgov, but are being engaged at an apartment blocktown of **Korenevo** (towards Rylsk) and farming villages of Kromskie Byki and Cheremoshki (towards Lgov).\n\nRybar claims Ukrainians have spent the evening of 7th and 8th August attempting to break through. Considering that Ukrainian operational success hinges on operational mobility and bypassing significant enemy concentration for encirclement, it **suggests the Russians may be trying to push a response force through (or may have a more substantial garrison in) Korenevo, and Ukrainian forces must secure their flanks for the maneuver elements pushing further north.**\n\nRybar reports that Ukrainian DRGs (scouts; Sabotage-Reconnaissance in Russian terminology) approaching towards **Lgov** has been engaging with heavy small arms fire along the road, including at Kromskie Byki and Cheremoshki (implying that they're being ambushed as they travel). That being said, **Lgov is already being evacuated, with residents in a traffic jam presumably headed to Kursk city.**\n\n**Voenkor (via ColonelCassad/ Boris Rozhin claims the force heading Northeast were DRGs in 5 vehicles, and were repelled by RF forces,** ***without photographic/video evidence*** *(unlike at Korenevo).* It is possible the Russians have lost bead on Ukrainian forces on this axis once again; It is also possible Kursk city SOBR (equivalent to SWAT or Ukrainian National Police KORD) may have responded to this, and the latter does have night vision equipment and potentially armored cars to keep shadowing the Ukrainians traveling on that axis, although they don't have the ability to crack open Ukrainian IMVs or AFVs with their organic TO&E. In that respect they're the complete opposite of foot-mobile conscripts with RPGs.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that the area being operated upon is essentially farmland with plenty of good conditioned access roads navigable by any AFV available to Ukrainian forces, yet Russian civil photos from individual evacuees, and reports from **Rybar has only talked about sightings of or engagements with Ukrainian forces along main roads. If these reports are taken at face value, Ukrainians are navigating with main roads, and using farmland access roads to flank major settlements along the way.** *This is how Sudzha was encircled, and the local conscript garrison surrendered, while local Sudzha law enforcement fled on roads (evident from civilian private car dashcam).* It appears the conscript garrison at Korenevo is being more plucky, but they're still susceptible to getting encircled like their peers in Sudzha.\n\nLive map here: [https://www.svoboda.org/a/33069581.html](https://www.svoboda.org/a/33069581.html)\n\n**Speculation**: Given that **Koronevo** has contact with Ukrainian mechanized for the past two evenings (7th and 8th) but has yet to be occupied/bypassed, I suspect the garrison of Koronevo are conscript foot-mobiles with basic small arms (AKs and RPGs) and relatively competent NCO leadership steeling them into place. Furthermore, Boris Rozhin (ColonelCassad) has posted footage depicting Lancet frontal hits on an uparmored Ukrainian T-64, and a 8x8 BTR/APC. No flames, however. If this footage is indeed at Koronevo, then there are contact with higher-echelon units that have tasked assets to assist the Koronevo garrison. However, given that this is the only claimed footage at Koronevo Russia-based sources have published, availability of fires remain insufficient at Koronevo to prevent a night-time encirclement of the settlement, which will eventually force the garrison there to break out or surrender; Koronevo can't be held by the garrisoning forces without more Russian resources directed to the Kursk front, as night fighing abilities of the garrison present is likely nonexistent, and Group 2 UAV/loitering munition support remains spotty.\n\nIt is an imperative for Ukrainian forces to bypass Korenovo and mine every avenue of egress out of the settlement; the garrison there does not appear to have standoff anti-vehicle systems, thus bypassing towards the next objective will not jeopardize the safety of the vehicles - certainly safer than waiting for occasional Lancet hits that will sooner or later cause more catastrophic results. The garrison does not appear to have organic mobility assets necessary to break out towards either direction (towards or away from Ukrainian borders) especially if countered by mines. Using the naval analogy, Koronevo is the only place thus far that Russia has managed to find and fix the Ukrainian raiding force, which is unfavorable to Ukraine's operational goals.\n\nI think th**e Russian administration in Kursk perceives a great threat from Ukrainian \"DRGs\" heading northeast of Sudzha towards Kursk City, and may have dispatched his city's SOBR units to intercept the scouts.** Without visual confirmation it's unclear whether the Russians have successfully repelled the probing movements as ColonelCassad claims. SOBR is able to track Ukrainian movements in all-weather 24/7 with their night vision, but they lack the implements to counter Ukrainian IMVs and AFVs certainly present on that sector. **In comparison, Lgov appears to be proactively abandoned, with local garrison being sent to harass/delay the oncoming Ukrainian advance towards it.**\n\n**IF the Ukrainian advances culminates within the next 24 hours:** Sudzha will be used as bait to lure in more heavy mechanized Russian brigades. Foot-mobile conscripts and Kursk SOBR police alone aren't likely to be able to retake Sudzha considering Ukrainian armored presence. However, making a stand at Sudzha will first require the Western flank at Korenevo be secured for Ukrainian forces.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Based on information collated by Radio Liberty from mostly RU milbloggers (Rybar, Dva Mayora) and civilian photos, there is an expectation from unofficial Russian sources (narrative presented by Rybar) that Ukrainian forces in Kursk are attempting to advance to Rylsk and Lgov, but are being engaged at an apartment blocktown of <strong>Korenevo</strong> (towards Rylsk) and farming villages of Kromskie Byki and Cheremoshki (towards Lgov).</p>\n\n<p>Rybar claims Ukrainians have spent the evening of 7th and 8th August attempting to break through. Considering that Ukrainian operational success hinges on operational mobility and bypassing significant enemy concentration for encirclement, it <strong>suggests the Russians may be trying to push a response force through (or may have a more substantial garrison in) Korenevo, and Ukrainian forces must secure their flanks for the maneuver elements pushing further north.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rybar reports that Ukrainian DRGs (scouts; Sabotage-Reconnaissance in Russian terminology) approaching towards <strong>Lgov</strong> has been engaging with heavy small arms fire along the road, including at Kromskie Byki and Cheremoshki (implying that they&#39;re being ambushed as they travel). That being said, <strong>Lgov is already being evacuated, with residents in a traffic jam presumably headed to Kursk city.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Voenkor (via ColonelCassad/ Boris Rozhin claims the force heading Northeast were DRGs in 5 vehicles, and were repelled by RF forces,</strong> <strong><em>without photographic/video evidence</em></strong> <em>(unlike at Korenevo).</em> It is possible the Russians have lost bead on Ukrainian forces on this axis once again; It is also possible Kursk city SOBR (equivalent to SWAT or Ukrainian National Police KORD) may have responded to this, and the latter does have night vision equipment and potentially armored cars to keep shadowing the Ukrainians traveling on that axis, although they don&#39;t have the ability to crack open Ukrainian IMVs or AFVs with their organic TO&amp;E. In that respect they&#39;re the complete opposite of foot-mobile conscripts with RPGs.</p>\n\n<p>What I find interesting is that the area being operated upon is essentially farmland with plenty of good conditioned access roads navigable by any AFV available to Ukrainian forces, yet Russian civil photos from individual evacuees, and reports from <strong>Rybar has only talked about sightings of or engagements with Ukrainian forces along main roads. If these reports are taken at face value, Ukrainians are navigating with main roads, and using farmland access roads to flank major settlements along the way.</strong> <em>This is how Sudzha was encircled, and the local conscript garrison surrendered, while local Sudzha law enforcement fled on roads (evident from civilian private car dashcam).</em> It appears the conscript garrison at Korenevo is being more plucky, but they&#39;re still susceptible to getting encircled like their peers in Sudzha.</p>\n\n<p>Live map here: <a href=\"https://www.svoboda.org/a/33069581.html\">https://www.svoboda.org/a/33069581.html</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Speculation</strong>: Given that <strong>Koronevo</strong> has contact with Ukrainian mechanized for the past two evenings (7th and 8th) but has yet to be occupied/bypassed, I suspect the garrison of Koronevo are conscript foot-mobiles with basic small arms (AKs and RPGs) and relatively competent NCO leadership steeling them into place. Furthermore, Boris Rozhin (ColonelCassad) has posted footage depicting Lancet frontal hits on an uparmored Ukrainian T-64, and a 8x8 BTR/APC. No flames, however. If this footage is indeed at Koronevo, then there are contact with higher-echelon units that have tasked assets to assist the Koronevo garrison. However, given that this is the only claimed footage at Koronevo Russia-based sources have published, availability of fires remain insufficient at Koronevo to prevent a night-time encirclement of the settlement, which will eventually force the garrison there to break out or surrender; Koronevo can&#39;t be held by the garrisoning forces without more Russian resources directed to the Kursk front, as night fighing abilities of the garrison present is likely nonexistent, and Group 2 UAV/loitering munition support remains spotty.</p>\n\n<p>It is an imperative for Ukrainian forces to bypass Korenovo and mine every avenue of egress out of the settlement; the garrison there does not appear to have standoff anti-vehicle systems, thus bypassing towards the next objective will not jeopardize the safety of the vehicles - certainly safer than waiting for occasional Lancet hits that will sooner or later cause more catastrophic results. The garrison does not appear to have organic mobility assets necessary to break out towards either direction (towards or away from Ukrainian borders) especially if countered by mines. Using the naval analogy, Koronevo is the only place thus far that Russia has managed to find and fix the Ukrainian raiding force, which is unfavorable to Ukraine&#39;s operational goals.</p>\n\n<p>I think th<strong>e Russian administration in Kursk perceives a great threat from Ukrainian &quot;DRGs&quot; heading northeast of Sudzha towards Kursk City, and may have dispatched his city&#39;s SOBR units to intercept the scouts.</strong> Without visual confirmation it&#39;s unclear whether the Russians have successfully repelled the probing movements as ColonelCassad claims. SOBR is able to track Ukrainian movements in all-weather 24/7 with their night vision, but they lack the implements to counter Ukrainian IMVs and AFVs certainly present on that sector. <strong>In comparison, Lgov appears to be proactively abandoned, with local garrison being sent to harass/delay the oncoming Ukrainian advance towards it.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>IF the Ukrainian advances culminates within the next 24 hours:</strong> Sudzha will be used as bait to lure in more heavy mechanized Russian brigades. Foot-mobile conscripts and Kursk SOBR police alone aren&#39;t likely to be able to retake Sudzha considering Ukrainian armored presence. However, making a stand at Sudzha will first require the Western flank at Korenevo be secured for Ukrainian forces.</p>\n</div>",

By the time they're on station it's bingo fuel and they have to blow their load at the most likely target area, which due to the lack of real time drone feed, is a low probability target.\n\nRussian forces are heavily reliant on Group 1 UAVs for real time battlefield recon, and those recon teams are now smoked. They don't have nowhere enough MALE UAVs (Group 4 and 5) to spare and task to find these raiders. Their priorities isn't securing Kursk. RF are more concerned with inching forward in Donbas, and their tasking of UAVs reflect this. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\nIMO most Russian recon assets were heavily front-loaded towards the border in preparation for a second Russian invasion of Sumy. Ukraine smelled blood and went for a spoiling attack. Those RF units were bypassed, cut off, and rendered no-factor.\n\nAnd behind those recon assets at the Kursk border? Nobody. Turns out, the men stationed at Kursk were redirected to double-down at Vovchansk to try and break out the Aggregate plant pocket (Stalingrad from Wish except it's the Russians that are trapped).\n\nSo now, Ukraine is spearheading with GBAD cover, and all the front-loaded RF air recon (drone) has already been smoked or captured. So now, Russia has no real-time coverage of Ukrainian movements. Ukraine hasn't released any footage of their activities until they've well moved onto the next settlement, so now the Russians are stuck bombing the previous town the Ukrainians were previously raiding. By the time civilians' footage of Ukrainian troops made it to Central Moscow command's attention and fires are tasked, the Ukrainians have left for the next objective.\n\nIt's like the first few days of the Kharkiv counteroffensive. RF assets were front-loaded with nothing behind. Actually, I lied. Both cases, there were rear guards. Kadyrovets. Both times they ran with tails between their legs. The Ukrainian raid force has yet to meet organized resistance from a peer mechanized unit. All they met so far were drone recon teams they smoked on day 1, border guards, local cops, and young conscripts. I'm talking early 20s year old people - a rarity in Russian professional force composition.

Hence, nothing is getting repositioned to respond as we speak. All their responses currently are air-to-ground and SRBM fires. Their attack helos are getting swatted by drones and MANPADS, and Iskander can't hit what has already vacated the town.\n\nUkraine *will* have to leave Kursk if Russia decides to task multiple mech brigades to respond to the advance, but I'd argue that's what Ukraine is trying to provoke.

The social contract in Russia is that the Kremlin doesn't interfere with provincial existence and provide meagre pensions, in return for the depoliticized provincial masses to sit out the political games - do not interfere with Russia's foreign adventures, do not disrupt the profits of the Oligarchy, nor work towards advancing rule-of-law. \"Let us bugger around and get rich, and we throw you the scraps\". Accordingly, it is in the interest of maintaining the Adventurist-Oligarchic status quo to keep this majority voting mass depoliticized, and keep their numbers well into the majority.\n\nSo, why wouldn't the Kremlin mobilize this mass towards the Russian-Imperialist National Idea to further fuel the war? Simply due to the fact that it is verily the bloc of Russian Imperialists that were the greatest threat to regime stability. Remember the Club of Angry Patriots spearheaded by Igor Girkin, the man who butchered occupied Donbas and committed acts of international terrorism against MH17 to stick it to the Dutch? Girkin's in a penal colony and silenced now. Prigozhin, too was silenced and the Wagner movement subordinated into the Kremlin structure. Wagner isn't as ideologically committed to the New Russian Empire as Girkin, but they're still pro-expansionist, pro-war. Puzzlingly, Putin and the Kremlin went down on them just as hard as he went after the \"Tolstoy Russians\".\n\nBut why? Regime security and coup-proofing. Putin and Kremlin's #1 objective isn't the renewed Imperial project. It's securing their place in the power structure to continue the looting of Russian national wealth for their own benefit; the war and the expansionist motive plays second fiddle. If there's a forced choice between the \"Holy War\" and \"keeping one's place on the power vertical\", even Putin himself will choose the latter.\n\nPoint being, Putin can't risk the depoliticized mass from either becoming the \"Tolstoy Russians\" nor the \"Angry Patriots\". The former are anti-war, and varying in their degree of friendliness to the Western neoliberal idea. Some of them are bad faith actors trying to forward a Russian Empire lite, but that's besides the point for this discussion. But the Angry Patriots - they know exactly just how the Kremlin has bungled the war, and continues to bungle the war. After all, the war is just a power fantasy, or simply a farce for the Kremlin insiders to enrich themselves, and more importantly, retain their enriching positions on the power vertical (Putin included). The Angry Patriots actually prioritizes the war and the Imperial Ideal over personal riches, and for that reason - they seek to tear down the current power vertical and become the new powers that be.\n\nIt is this framework that led me to believe why the Kremlin cracked down on the Angry Patriots, and remain incentivized to keep the Provincial Masses depoliticized - since there's only two ways to go from there - Tolstoy, or Girkin. And both is a threat to the Kremlin's place.",

Let me reformulate it in full:\n\nIn the first days of the invasion, the Russian forces moved from location to location, sometimes engaging in chats and friendly interactions with Ukrainian civilians - who ranged from pro-Russian (rare) through depoliticised to turbopatriotic (also rare - think, the sunflower seeds lady). Same as you're describing the Ukrainians would, now. The approval of the Ukrainian government and president Zelenskiy was very low; the amount of people who planned to fight in war if one came was relatively low. *Yet over time, due to escalating violence and Ukrainian narrative control, the mood has shifted in such a way that the depoliticised Ukrainians have fallen out of the conversation entirely, and the pro-Russian ones, likely lower in number now, haven't been a huge advantage for Russian goals.* They exist, they've stayed behind the frontline, they make for some propaganda every now and then, take up state resources - but do little beyond that for the strategic goals of, perhaps, swaying the rest of Ukraine. *Now transplanting that story with the roles reversed, I don't see why the Ukrainian invaders behaving friendly would induce some fundamental change in Russian civilians, when the destruction of their homes and deaths of their acquaintances in the escalating violence, as well as the even stronger narrative control in Russia, would be pushing them in the other direction.*\n\nYour, ehm, interesting description of Girkin aside, your description of the situation in Russia is spot-on, but you also seem to imply that even radicalising the depoliticised Russians might be a good gamble for Ukraine as it unbalances Putin's regime. I don't know if it's true - the March of Justice affected Ukraine very little, and an unbalanced Putin has less leeway for negotiation, even if he wanted it in good faith. Hopefully it's clear by now that Ukraine cannot conclude this conflict other than at the negotiating table, so Angry Patriots having leverage is a hindrance to that.\n\nIt's true that anything grassroots, including patriotism, is rather scary to the Russian government, but there the state generally has a much greater capacity to enforce its will. When you see the same in Ukraine (grassroots nationalism/anger outpacing the state's general line) the state has much less of an ability to enforce its will whenever some Neo-Nazis block the army from pulling back (before the war's restarting), or when they send all non-ideological people into the meatgrinder while retaining ideological comrades (67th Brigade). Putin's repression of Girkin might be less due to a fear of Girkin than a show that no dissent at all is acceptable, and the state can get away with that; while Zelenskiy is facing uncertain times to say the least once the last gun falls silent. Suffice it to say, he might not be long for this world if he doesn't take the ride this time. *So, unbalancing the Russian state is likely going to be less effective for Ukraine than unbalancing the Ukrainian state has been for Russia, and the latter one has pretty much failed.*",

That alone is why I say the Russians (and Ukrainians for that matter) are heavily reliant on Group 1 UAVs for battlefield recon.

If I'm wargaming on Russia's behalf - leaving the raid group untracked for longer is a massive problem. It's like the \"tailing a warship\" problem. The longer I lose track of the enemy, the more degrees of freedom they have, and eventually you have no idea where they are and where they're most likely headed.

Ukraine blew up a rail bridge back in 2022 but Russia repaired it. As far as I can tell the Russians still actively use this rail line.\n\nSudzha is the sole station currently facilitating the flow of gas from Russia through Ukraine to Europe. Although there are technically two stations, no gas has passed through the Sokhranivka gas metering station since May 2022 \u2014 this is due to the fact that its compressor station is located in a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk Oblast.\n\nif the Ukrainian military establishes stable control over the Sudzha gas metering station, Gazprom might halt supplies, potentially declaring a \u201cforce majeure\u201d \u2014 a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control.

Thus interdicting the line at Kursk does choke off supply flow to Belgorod, which I assume is a significant logistical hub for incursions against Kharkiv, but far as I can tell it has no great bearing on logistics towards the Donbas theater as there's electrified lines further east that go straight to Moscow/Bryansk. \n\nOn the other hand, Kursk hosts a sizable classification yard which, following their disastrous loss of Kupiansk (one of the biggest hump yards in Eastern Europe) might provide significant logistical capacity to break down and rebuild trains for return trips.

Anyways, I'm not sure how many units have been committed. If it's just a battalion, then yeah. Being down a mobile company is going to compromise offensive options. But if we're to believe the RU-bloggers, and a Brigade sized Ukrainian task force is now rolling about, a company with serious vehicle losses isn't going to change the equation much. That company of newly-minted foot-mobiles can garrison Sudzha while waiting for replacement vehicles.\n\nI don't think the worthwhile quarry is the destruction/capture of Russian forces in the border settlements. The quarry will be from the destroyed rail infrastructure, and stolen/destroyed Russian pre-positioned materiel destined for the upcoming invasion of Sumy Oblast. In terms of Russian personnel loss, it's about 300 POWs, mostly foot-mobile un-motorized conscripts, border guards, and local police. The conscripts may be politically sensitive, however, as they look like healthy young people from the Metropole; people whose capture and failure to swiftly negotiate a release will cause discontent among the privileged class in Russia. \n\nBut again, personnel losses are peanuts and not the primary objective, I reckon. Aside from spoiling the attack into Sumy, it's as you've said: wreck the rail connection into Belgorod and undermine the Russian attack on Vovchansk. Wreck the classification railyard and stress the already critical Russian Railways even further, creating systems-wide effect that will decrease materiel availability for RU forces deployed in Ukraine, and decrease Russian strategic-operational mobility as a whole (which is heavily rail-dependent).\n\nIf I were wargaming for Ukraine, I'd have these quantifiable conditions for success: **Destroy the direct rail link to Belgorod, Destroy the classification yard and deny it to the enemy, and when the push culminates: dig in, defense in depth, and fighting retreat - drawing out offensive enemy mechanized units and achieve a minimum of 3:1 loss ratio on the enemy**. Those lightly armed foot-mobiles don't count, that's just a bonus from the initial maneuver. The more heavy mech units get retasked from the East and South to slog it in Kursk, the better. Force Russia to inch forward and take heavy losses, and level everything to rubble on *their own territory*. If Ukraine can **destroy critical rail infrastructure to create system shocks across the Russian rail network, shift the center of gravity of the ongoing war towards Kursk, fall back to defense in depth, and inflict disproportionate losses upon the enemy, that's a win.** It's scores of dead Russian forces, complete rubble on Russian land, and giving much breathing room for Ukrainian forces in the East.\n\nIMO, **Russia is in a dilemma and only has bad and worse options** to respond to this Ukrainian incursion. Ukraine has committed to the fight in Kursk. The **bad option for Russia is force Ukraine to culminate the offensive, and then we go back to the wargaming paragraph**. It would buy much needed breathing space for Ukrainian forces in the East. Time to rotate, build more fortifications, and train more mobilized reserves. The **worse option for Russia is to not take the bait, remain hyperfixated on New York, Toretsk, and Pokrovsk,** *watch Ukraine wreck more rail infrastructure*, *destroy/loot more pre-positioned mechanized materiel destined for the Sumy invasion, and perhaps even manage to take the KNPP.* The longer Russia doesn't take the bait, the more Ukraine will be likely to succeed in this counteroffensive operation, whatever the realistic goals in reach may be. \n\n**The longer Russia refuses to take the bait in Kursk, the more likely Ukraine succeeds in their (increasingly ambitious) operational goals in Kursk.** If Russia pivoted within the first 24 hour, all Ukraine would've achieved was 2-300 RF POWs, and some destruction of pre-positioned Russian mechanized materiel. Now we're talking about Ukraine digging in and forcing Russia to re-take Kursk border towns the hard way (and turn them into rubble). If Russia continues to not commit into the Kursk direction, then next week we'll be talking about the potential seizure of Kursk NPP, and how that could lead to negotiations to force Russia to leave parts of, if not all of occupied Ukraine.",

The domestic rhetoric they've used certainly mirrors a war footing, but despite a relatively compliant populous Putin still hasn't pulled the trigger on mobilization yet. One can only assume there are domestic political concerns around mobilization that Putin is actively afraid of. Past mobilizations were deeply unpopular, so if your regime is shakier than you're letting on, the instability that may come from mobilization is a high risk scenario for Russia.",
