        "body": ">**[Russia is grabbing men off the street to fight in Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/16/russia-mobilization-men/)**\n\n>Police and military officers swooped down on a Moscow business center this past week unannounced. They were looking for men to fight in Ukraine \u2014 and they seized nearly every one they saw. Some musicians, rehearsing. A courier there to deliver a parcel. A man from a Moscow service agency, very drunk, in his mid-50s, with a walking disability.\n\n>\u201cI have no idea why they took him,\u201d said Alexei, who, like dozens of others in the office complex, was rounded up and taken to the nearest military enlistment office, part of a harsh new phase in the Russian drive.\n\n>In cities and towns across Russia, men of fighting age are going into hiding to avoid the officials who are seizing them and sending them to fight in Ukraine.\n\n>Police and military press-gangs in recent days have snatched men off the streets and outside Metro stations. They\u2019ve lurked in apartment building lobbies to hand out military summonses. They\u2019ve raided office blocks and hostels. They\u2019ve invaded cafes and restaurants, blocking the exits.\n\n>At a predawn sweep on the Mipstroy1 construction company dormitories on Thursday, they took more than 200 men. On Oct. 9, they rounded up dozens at a Moscow shelter for the homeless.\n\n>The press-gangs appear to descend at random. It is terrifying \u2014 and, at times, comically haphazard. Alexei, a 30-something pacifist, lives with his cat and, until he was hauled off, enjoyed hanging out with friends in bars, cafes and parks, going to concerts and planning his next holiday in Europe. (He and others in this report spoke on the condition that his last name be withheld out of concern for his safety. The Washington Post has confirmed the raid, but could not independently verify the details he provided.)\n\n>Russia\u2019s airstrikes, intended to show force, reveal another weakness\n\n>An official barged into Alexei\u2019s office on Tuesday. Two police officers and several plainclothes military officials arrived and demanded his identification. They ordered him to go with them quietly \u201cor we will use force,\u201d he said.\n\n>\u201cI was panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d never been detained before. Everyone knows that if you are detained by the police in Russia, it\u2019s very bad.\u201d\n\n>Suffering massive military casualties and repeated defeats in Ukraine, Russia has begun cannibalizing its male population. The hard-eyed pundits on state television are demanding more Ukrainian blood and more sacrifice from Russian men who they say have grown too used to soft living.\n\n>But the new phase of Putin\u2019s mobilization risks denting Russians\u2019 tacit support for the war and even his manufactured popularity \u2014 and could stir social unrest. Particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg, major cities that until now have been largely untouched by the war.\n\n>More than 300,000 Russian men and their families have fled Russia since mobilization, reports from neighboring countries indicate. Authorities have set up mobilization points at border crossings to prevent departures. Many others want to leave after seeing the aggressive police raids and the first reports of the newly conscripted men dying in the war.\n\n>Activist Grigory Sverdlin, who left Russia and is based in Georgia, this month launched an organization, Go by the Forest, to advise men in Russia on avoiding the draft. He said the group has consulted with 2,700 men in 11 days and told 60 drafted men how to surrender in Ukraine. At least eight have succeeded, he said.\n\n>\u201cObviously, people are very stressed because they are worried they will be pushed to shoot other people,\u201d Sverdlin said. \u201cSo people are afraid not only for themselves, but about taking part in this unjust war.\u201d\n\n>Yevgeny, 24, quit his job as a mechanic and is hiding at a relative\u2019s dacha far from Moscow. He has deleted his social media profiles and cut contact with friends. He spends his days working in the garden, and he goes to bed early and watches a lot of YouTube.\n\n>\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill people, and I don\u2019t want to be killed, so I really have to lie low now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even here, I don\u2019t feel safe. We live at a time when your neighbors could report on you. They might call police and say that there is a young guy staying in this house when he should be fighting fascists in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n>Yevgeny never supported the war. Now he has stopped driving for fear of being pulled over by police. He cannot leave Russia, because he has no passport, and even going to the store in the small village feels risky.\n\n>As Putin escalates war, some in Russia\u2019s business elite despair\n\n>\u201cI am panicking, and my mom is very nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m stressed, and I\u2019m depressed. I try not to think how long this could go on, because you can go crazy.\u201d\n\n>Two of his friends are worse off. They were conscripted late last month, he said, and with little training are on their way to the front.",

A man from a Moscow service agency, very drunk, in his mid-50s, with a walking disability.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have no idea why they took him,\u201d said Alexei, who, like dozens of others in the office complex, was rounded up and taken to the nearest military enlistment office, part of a harsh new phase in the Russian drive.</p>\n\n<p>In cities and towns across Russia, men of fighting age are going into hiding to avoid the officials who are seizing them and sending them to fight in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Police and military press-gangs in recent days have snatched men off the streets and outside Metro stations. They\u2019ve lurked in apartment building lobbies to hand out military summonses. They\u2019ve raided office blocks and hostels. They\u2019ve invaded cafes and restaurants, blocking the exits.</p>\n\n<p>At a predawn sweep on the Mipstroy1 construction company dormitories on Thursday, they took more than 200 men. On Oct. 9, they rounded up dozens at a Moscow shelter for the homeless.</p>\n\n<p>The press-gangs appear to descend at random. It is terrifying \u2014 and, at times, comically haphazard. Alexei, a 30-something pacifist, lives with his cat and, until he was hauled off, enjoyed hanging out with friends in bars, cafes and parks, going to concerts and planning his next holiday in Europe. (He and others in this report spoke on the condition that his last name be withheld out of concern for his safety. The Washington Post has confirmed the raid, but could not independently verify the details he provided.)</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s airstrikes, intended to show force, reveal another weakness</p>\n\n<p>An official barged into Alexei\u2019s office on Tuesday. Two police officers and several plainclothes military officials arrived and demanded his identification. They ordered him to go with them quietly \u201cor we will use force,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d never been detained before. Everyone knows that if you are detained by the police in Russia, it\u2019s very bad.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Suffering massive military casualties and repeated defeats in Ukraine, Russia has begun cannibalizing its male population. The hard-eyed pundits on state television are demanding more Ukrainian blood and more sacrifice from Russian men who they say have grown too used to soft living.</p>\n\n<p>But the new phase of Putin\u2019s mobilization risks denting Russians\u2019 tacit support for the war and even his manufactured popularity \u2014 and could stir social unrest. Particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg, major cities that until now have been largely untouched by the war.</p>\n\n<p>More than 300,000 Russian men and their families have fled Russia since mobilization, reports from neighboring countries indicate. Authorities have set up mobilization points at border crossings to prevent departures. Many others want to leave after seeing the aggressive police raids and the first reports of the newly conscripted men dying in the war.</p>\n\n<p>Activist Grigory Sverdlin, who left Russia and is based in Georgia, this month launched an organization, Go by the Forest, to advise men in Russia on avoiding the draft. He said the group has consulted with 2,700 men in 11 days and told 60 drafted men how to surrender in Ukraine. At least eight have succeeded, he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cObviously, people are very stressed because they are worried they will be pushed to shoot other people,\u201d Sverdlin said. \u201cSo people are afraid not only for themselves, but about taking part in this unjust war.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yevgeny, 24, quit his job as a mechanic and is hiding at a relative\u2019s dacha far from Moscow. He has deleted his social media profiles and cut contact with friends. He spends his days working in the garden, and he goes to bed early and watches a lot of YouTube.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill people, and I don\u2019t want to be killed, so I really have to lie low now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even here, I don\u2019t feel safe. We live at a time when your neighbors could report on you. They might call police and say that there is a young guy staying in this house when he should be fighting fascists in Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yevgeny never supported the war. Now he has stopped driving for fear of being pulled over by police. He cannot leave Russia, because he has no passport, and even going to the store in the small village feels risky.</p>\n\n<p>As Putin escalates war, some in Russia\u2019s business elite despair</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am panicking, and my mom is very nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m stressed, and I\u2019m depressed. I try not to think how long this could go on, because you can go crazy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Two of his friends are worse off. They were conscripted late last month, he said, and with little training are on their way to the front.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

But they are changing their opinions after mobilization. They have started to ask questions and surf the internet for information,\u201d Yevgeny said.\n\n>\u201cThey don\u2019t want to die, especially when you don\u2019t understand why you should die,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the point?\u201d\n\n>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that 222,000 of the 300,000 target had been conscripted and that the process would be completed within two weeks. Pro-war hard-liners insist a second round will be needed.\n\n>The raids in Moscow and St. Petersburg have been deeply controversial, in part because the cities have suffered comparatively few casualties in Ukraine. The burden of fighting has largely been borne by small ethnic groups and poorly educated men from impoverished rural regions.\n\n>In a sign that the government fears a growing urban backlash over the raids, Andrei Klishas, a senior member of Putin\u2019s United Russia party, said Friday that the conscription drives were illegal.\n\n>\u201cIt is inadmissible to grab everyone on the street indiscriminately,\u201d he said.\n\n>Antiwar sentiment could harden as the bodies of soldiers who were deployed just weeks earlier begin returning home for burial. Alexei Martynov, the 29-year-old head of a Moscow government department, was mobilized Sept. 23 and was killed Oct. 10. He was buried last week. Five soldiers from the Southern Urals region, mobilized on Sept. 26 and Sept. 29, were killed in Ukraine in early October, authorities in Chelyabinsk reported.\n\n>A comrade of the Chelyabinsk men who survived an overwhelming Ukrainian assault called a friend and described what happened, according to the transcript of a phone call published by BBC News Russian. He said he had been given no training. When he fled, he said, corpses lay everywhere.\n\n>\u201cWe got there the first day, having never fired a shot, and they sent us, like meat, straight to an assault unit, with two grenade launchers. I had at least read the instructions on how to use them.\u201d By Day 3, the soldier and his comrades were in front-line trenches.\n\n>Almost daily, videos surface on Russian social media of conscripted soldiers, angry because they have not been given decent uniforms, weapons, training or quarters. Testimonies about men who should be exempt being sent to fight are common. Aleksei Sachkov, a 45-year-old Moscow doctor, signed a contract to treat wounded soldiers in Voronezh, Russia, near the border with Ukraine. He stopped calling his wife, Natalia, on Sept. 24. She learned from Russia\u2019s military hotline a week later that he was fighting in Ukraine as part of a tank unit, she said in a video posted online.\n\n>As unease grows, men of military age are being turned back at borders as they try to leave the country. In March, weeks after Putin launched the invasion, he promised there would be no mobilization. But last month, he dashed the tacit assurance that the conflict would be fought only by professional soldiers in return for the Russian public\u2019s passive acceptance of the war. The widespread anger over Putin\u2019s Sept. 21 announcement suggests that public support for the war is lower than the Kremlin claims.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s the regime\u2019s agony, because quite a common opinion in Russia now is that this war is lost,\u201d Sverdlin said. \u201cAnd it seems that just giving out summonses, detaining many thousands of people and sending them to war just buys this regime a bit more time. But it\u2019s just buying time, because, obviously, these people who were caught on the streets now won\u2019t make good soldiers because they don\u2019t know how to fight.\u201d\n\n>As the backlash intensifies, some Russians are confronting authorities and recording videos. A woman berated a team in the lobby of her St. Petersburg apartment building. A Russian truck driver posted video of himself confronting a police officer and a military enlistment official who tried to take him to the enlistment office.\n\n>\u201cI don\u2019t give a s--- about your mobilization. You\u2019re the one who is eligible, not me. You\u2019ve got a gun after all, not me. Why don\u2019t you go mobilize yourself?\u201d\n\n>The police officer tried to write a charge, demanding the driver\u2019s documents.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you my documents. Why should I?\u201d the truck driver said, \u201cIf you fail to create order in your country, why do it in another country? And how? By just destroying it completely?\u201d\n\n>In the rowdy hubbub of the military enlistment office where Alexei wound up, he said, many of the men were agitated, some were furious and others shrank into themselves. They queued at one office after another, where they were made to sign the military summons, submit their documents and undergo a medical examination. Many were office workers seized on the street. A couple of \u201cstrange ones\u201d told Alexei they were volunteers, looking for an exciting lifestyle change.\n\n>He was shocked by how many men meekly donned the army uniforms that were handed to them and let themselves be taken, apparently directly to training bases. One of his work colleagues was among them.\n\n>\u201cI saw men who were lost and confused, and at the same time very weak,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to fight for themselves. They were given papers and obediently signed them all. They weren\u2019t focused. They just stared into space, as if they had given up.\u201d\n\n>For Alexei, the threats and bluff continued for hours as officials pressured him to sign the military summons. He refused. Police were called. They took no action, but a police guard at the door would not let him leave.\n\n>He watched the queues of nervous men. The drunken city worker was in a deep sleep. A member of the elite Russian Guard special police threw a noisy tantrum about the attempt to enlist him.\n\n>Alexei called a lawyer. He entered the office of the military commissar, filming him on his cellphone, demanding to know the legal basis for holding him.\n\n>\u201cHe got very angry and shouted at me to leave his office.\u201d At 8 p.m., he was finally allowed to leave. Now he wants to leave Russia but fears he could be conscripted at the border.\n\n>\u201cI want to wait until this is over, in a safe place.\u201d",

It could explain their continuing hesitation to strike critical decision-making centers even though they have demonstrated the capacity to target specific buildings.\n\nEven while Western countries closed or relocated their diplomatic missions as early as February before the invasion began, both the Chinese and Indian missions stubbornly remained in Kyiv well into mid-March despite the siege. The Indian mission has since returned to the capital, while I can't figure out whether China has. Of all the embassies in Kyiv, China's compound is the closest to Ukraine's centers of power. It's a two-minute walk from there to the government building, the parliament building, and the presidential palace. (Even the American embassy is a two-hour walk away.) An attempt to take out those buildings could conceivably be seen by the Chinese as being inconsiderate of their safety\u2014and imagine if they miss. There's also a hotel or two between the embassy and the civic buildings, the sort of place where foreign dignitaries and journalists might reside.\n\nNearly every embassy and consulate is located between Peremohy Avenue and the Dnipro, which is also where nearly every important state institution is located, making any strikes similarly risky. The headquarters of the SBU sits across the Panamanian consulate and is just a short walk north of the Armenian embassy, for example.",

At several points during its trips, Amur 2501 goes dark, with its tracking system not transmitting its location. It then appears to participate in multi-ship transfers of cargo in the open seas off the Russian port of Kavkaz with large vessels that then proceed to countries including Libya and Iran.\n\n>Satellite images, loading and unloading data compiled from ports and vessel-location transmissions obtained by Bloomberg place ships like Amur 2501 at the heart of what industry experts say is Russian shippers\u2019 illicit commodities trade. The exporters are mixing grain from multiple ports and vessels, obscuring the origin of commodities like wheat and barley, and allowing large volumes to be sold abroad without detection.\n\n>\u201cThey\u2019re using ship-to-ship transfers between legitimate and illegitimate products to mix them in order to try to launder them into a legitimate supply chain,\u201d said Ian Ralby, chief executive of I.R. Consilium, a maritime law and security consultancy. \u201cThey are working to launder the grain to create a degree of legitimacy or clarity of title so that they can engage in transactions with countries that really need the grains.\u201d\n\n>Putin\u2019s Escalating War\n\n>With President Vladimir Putin\u2019s escalating war in Ukraine stoking concerns of a fresh threat to Black Sea grain exports, demand and prices are likely to remain high, providing an even greater incentive to continue the laundered trade. The annexation of four Ukrainian territories at the end of September, which Russia said may add 5 million tons to its annual grain harvest, might have emboldened some exporters to more openly carry commodities from Sevastopol. But with much of the world refusing to recognize the land grab, the clandestine activity is continuing, according to Windward, a maritime risk consultant.\n\n>Before the conflict, Russia and Ukraine accounted for a quarter of the world\u2019s grain exports. So when Ukraine\u2019s ports were blocked in the early months of Russia\u2019s invasion, grain shipments were cut off, raising the specter of food shortages. A safe-corridor deal struck in July allowed Ukraine to resume exports, but shipments are still running 36% lower than last season. The intensifying conflict is now spurring fears that the deal won\u2019t be extended when it expires in about a month, just as the latest harvest winds down to bring fresh grain to the market.\n\n>From the last season\u2019s harvest, Russia stole or destroyed 4.04 million tons of grain and oilseeds valued at about $1.9 billion in Ukrainian territories, Roman Neyter at the Kyiv School of Economics estimates. Some shipments were exported directly from Crimea by Russian ships, but attempts to sell such commodities appear to have run into trouble \u2014 Egypt refused one undocumented shipment. Laundering grain allows shippers to hide its origins so it can make its way into eager Middle Eastern markets without a hitch.\n\n>The laundering techniques the grain shippers are using were first employed by oil exporters connected to Russia, Venezuela and Iran to evade sanctions.\n\n>\u201cShip-to-ship transfers are a common method of deceptive shipping practices initially used to circumvent sanctions on oil,\u201d said Gur Sender, a maritime product manager at Windward. \u201c(They) involve the use of dark activity and STS transfers.\u201d\n\n>Soaring Exports\n\n>Although it\u2019s difficult to definitively say that the grain carried by ships like Amur 2501 was stolen from parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia, the numbers tell a story that\u2019s hard to contest.\n\n>The Russian-occupied enclave of Crimea has shipped more than ten times its usual food-export volumes since March, according to Geneva-based researcher AgFlow, which compiles and cross-references data based on inspection reports, bills of lading, port lineups and other trade information. In the first few months after the war, shipments were at 50 times usual levels. A group of more than 30 ships have been calling at Sevastopol, some multiple times, according to AgFlow data.\n\n>Also, farmers in occupied areas have reported grain being taken away by truck, and visuals from Planet Labs PBC and Maxar Technologies, satellite imagery providers, show convoys arriving from the direction of Ukraine \u2014 likely carrying the commodity \u2014 and lined up at the grain terminal at Sevastopol. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s quite an elaborate scheme to hide the illicit origin of the grains, and it\u2019s really a new low to use sanctions-evasion techniques perfected in the Iran and North Korea context on a food item,\u201d said Justyna Gudzowska, Director of Illicit Finance Policy at The Sentry, a non-profit organization that investigates global corruption networks. \u201cFood shouldn\u2019t be weaponized the way it is here.\u201d\n\n>The Russian state is likely complicit in the grain laundering, said Gudzowska, who has advised the US Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control that handles sanctions.\n\n>\u201cAt a minimum Russia knows about the grain smuggling and it\u2019s tolerated,\u201d she said.\n\n>A spokesperson for the Kremlin redirected a request for a comment to Russia\u2019s defense ministry, which didn\u2019t respond.",

Images from Planet Labs show the ship loading at Sevastopol. Then ship-tracking shows it going dark and reappearing alongside multiple bulkers in the open sea that\u2019s the Kavkaz anchorage. It shows up at various points on ship-tracking next to such large vessels as Vera P and Petra I with the bulker Dynamic M and cargo ship Volgodonsk, on the other side. Bloomberg.com readers can watch one of the ship transfers in a visualization by Spire Global Inc. here.\n\n>Granted, international and local traders have long exported Russia\u2019s own grain from the Kavkaz harbor on the sea by the Kerch Strait, bringing it on smaller cargo boats like Amur 2501 from ports in the Azov Sea, which is too shallow for bulkers. They are then loaded onto larger vessels so that bigger volumes can be shipped across the Black Sea and through the Bosphorus to customers in the Middle East and Africa. That system has provided exporters of grain picked from Sevastopol an ideal cover for their illicit trade.\n\n>\u201cIf they are loading from two ships at the same time, it\u2019s very likely they\u2019re loading from ship #1 to ship #3 through the use of ship #2 in the middle,\u201d said Alexandros Glykas, a maritime professor at the Alba Graduate Business School in Athens and director of Dynamarine Co., which specializes in risk assurance for ship-to-ship transfers globally. \u201cYou would do this perhaps to manipulate the cargo\u2019s bill of lading. The more ship-to-ship transfers you are doing, the more difficult it is to trace the origin of the cargo.\u201d\n\n>Amur 2501 is listed as managed by Red Shipping LLC, headquartered in the Samara region of Russia, and owned and run by V. and Y. Chernikov, according to Spark Interfax data. A call to a number listed for that company was answered by a man who identified himself as Mr. Chernikov and declined to comment on whether he worked for Red Shipping or managed the Amur 2501. He said his ship routes are from Azov to Port Kavkaz and denied that Amur 2501 calls at Sevastopol, saying images showing such activity were photoshopped.\n\n>Petra I and Vera P, which appear to take part in ship-to-ship transfers with Amur 2501, are listed as managed by MCF Shipping DMCC in Dubai. A receptionist at MCF Shipping asked for an email requesting comment. Several emails to the company were not answered.\n\n>Dynamic M is listed as managed by Merry Enterprises Denizcilik Sanayi Ve Ticaret in Turkey. Asked about the vessel engaging with Amur 2501 in Kavkaz after the Russian ship made a stop in Sevastopol, Mustafa Murad, the owner of Merry Enterprises in Istanbul, called it \u201cfalse information.\u201d\n\n>Volgodonsk, which appears alongside Petra I when that ship is next to Amur 2501, is managed by RIF. The Russian shipper said by email that it conducts thorough checks on the origin of cargo and complies with international standards, but that \u201cdue to the large volume of purchases and transportation of grain crops,\u201d it is physically unable to monitor the movement of vessels that don\u2019t belong to the group, like Amur 2501. RIF also said fleet trackers \u201cvery often do not reflect the real location.\u201d\n\n>It is not clear if vessels that interacted with Amur 2501 were aware that it carried grain from Sevastopol.\n\n>Openly Harvesting Crops\n\n>There are no sanctions that target food trade from Russia, which has denied stealing grain. The country has, however, publicly touted the resumption of shipments from occupied ports. And now, with its annexation of the four Ukrainian territories, occupying forces speak openly of harvesting crops there.\n\n>Ukraine has asked importers to seize the stolen commodities and help it document the theft. In September, the US announced a fresh wave of sanctions, including against \u201cRussian proxy officials\u201d who have \u201coverseen the seizure or theft of hundreds of thousands of tons of Ukrainian grain.\u201d And although the stolen grain accounts for a very small part of Russia\u2019s overall food trade, Switzerland\u2019s top prosecutor has warned that trading of looted commodities could constitute a war crime.\n\n>By itself, Amur 2501 has made at least three trips to the Crimean port between May and August, according to data from AgFlow and Sea by Maritech. On four other occasions in August and September, Amur 2501 went dark as it exited Kavkaz toward Sevastopol, according to Sea by Maritech tracking. That suggests it was following a similar route.\n\n>Bloomberg\u2019s investigation also shows a pattern where ships load up on grain at the Russian port of Azov before picking up the commodity in Sevastopol, as Amur 2501 does on its trips.\n\n> Ships are usually traced by AIS signals they transmit. They are required by maritime law to keep their AIS turned on for safety, especially in busy waterways. When they are switched off, it \u201cis often interpreted as a signal that a vessel has operated suspiciously,\u201d according to Peter Williams, a trade-flow analyst at Vessels Value, a research house for the maritime and aviation markets.\n\n>Going Dark\n\n>The US sanctions agency says any signs of AIS manipulation \u2014 a red flag for deceptive shipping practices \u2014 should be \u201cinvestigated prior to entering into contracts with, continuing to provide services to, or engaging in other activities with such vessels.\u201d\n\n>Dark activities in the Black Sea have risen 160% in the 12 months ended June, almost all by carriers flying either the Russian or Syrian flags, according to data from Windward. Of those, 73% happened after the war began. The platform logged 170 instances of cargo and bulk carriers showing a certain pattern from March 1 to July 15: ships go dark in the Azov Sea and then resurface on their way through the Bosphorus Strait, with many calling at ports loaded up with grain.\n\n>Russia, which was earlier requisitioning grain in storage in silos from the last harvest, is now reaping grain in occupied areas. Ukraine\u2019s HarvEast has accused the country of taking grain it planted by truck to Russia, which is even more difficult to track than sea exports.\n\n>Nearly eight months into the war, these activities show no signs of stopping. If the war becomes a frozen conflict, stolen Ukrainian grain could continue to reach world markets in large quantities.\n\n>\u201cWe have a tricky situation where Russia is taking advantage of the fact that even if countries don\u2019t want to do business with them, they may need food enough so that even stolen grains could be attractive \u2014 if there\u2019s at least an effort to launder them,\u201d said I.R.

        "body": "Latest CITeam report out. As always refer the original for links and ambiguous translation. \n\nhttps://notes.citeam.org/ru-dispatch-oct-16-17\n\n\u2026\n\nPersonal comments : over the past week I\u2019ve seen a change of language in the reports - more ambiguous terms like \u201cwe believe\u201d or \u201cvideos exist\u201d or \u201cwe cannot verify\u201d are being used. So use your discretion with these, and understand that it\u2019s a marker of the growing fog of war/diplomacy and the inability of OSINT to be sure about these things.\n\nIf in doubt, check the original for links and make your assumptions.\n\n\u2026\n\nReport begins. \n\nSummary for October 16-17 (until 13:00)\n\n>Shelling of Ukrainian cities\n\n>On the night and morning of October 17, there were many reports of attacks with Shahed-136 barrage ammunition in different regions of Ukraine, including Kiev. Despite the fact that, mainly, the targets of drones were infrastructure facilities (for example, the Ukrenergo office), residential buildings were also hit. Of one of them, 18 people were rescued, two remain under the rubble. There is information about the dead. We don't know if the attacks on residential buildings were intentional or accidental.\n\n>It is reported that during the night, Ukrainian forces shot down 26 kamikaze drones, but some achieved their goals. The question of the number of Shahed-136 UAVs at the disposal of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation remains open, given that several dozen such drones are produced every day.\n\n>According to the head of the Nikolaev regional military administration Vitaly Kim, in the Nikolaev area barrage ammunition got into the warehouse of an industrial enterprise. As a result, a fire broke out, sunflower oil tanks and the office of a pharmaceutical company caught fire.\n\n>Some districts of Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk and Sumy regions were also under attack. The goals were energy and critical infrastructure facilities, there are victims.\n\n>On October 16, more than 40 Russian shells arrived in Nikopol and a 47-year-old man was wounded.\n\n>In Bakhmut, which is now actually on the front line, the rocket flew into a residential building, there are dead. Despite the fact that mandatory evacuation has long been declared in the area, civilians still remain in Bakhmut.\n\nThe situation on the front line\n\n>Def Mon analyst reports unsuccessful Russian attacks on the Donetsk direction and on the Bakhmut-Soledar line. Judging by the satellite images of FIRMS fires, the fighting continues, but without much progress.\n\n>There are reports that the lull in the Kherson direction could have been due to changes in weather conditions - showers began. Our team believes that this hypothesis can be true.\n\nUkrainian shelling\n\n>The Russian side said that the Donetsk city administration was shelled, there were two victims. They claim that the shelling was carried out from the Highmars MLRS, but without evidence. The photographed fragments of the projectile are very difficult to identify (but this time the military were able to photograph them correctly).\n\n>Since city administrations usually have military leadership, they are a military target, so we believe that it was targeted shelling.\n\n>Geolocating yesterday's video shot near the Belgorod airport, the researchers came to the conclusion that most likely the missile hit the Pantsir anti-aircraft missile and gun complex. The degree of its damage is unknown.\n\n>Earlier, the wreckage of AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missiles was already found in the Belgorod region.\n\n>A video of the arrival, presumably a GMLRS shell on the positions of Russian soldiers, has been published.\n\n>Russian forces began to use Geranium-1 drones. These are Shahed-131 barrage ammunition, visually very similar to \"Heranium-2\" (Shahed-136), but significantly smaller in size. They can be distinguished by the engine, which is much smaller in the Shahed-131, and by some parts of the hull - in the Shahed-136 the warhead (about 50 kg) protrudes beyond the triangular hull.\n\n>Western intelligence concluded that Iran was preparing to transfer two types of ballistic missiles to Russia: Fateh-110 (range 300 km) and Zolfaghar (range 700 km). In terms of technical characteristics, these missiles are close to Iskander missiles (including the mass of the warhead) and have a circular probable deviation of about 15 m. We consider the supply of these Iranian ballistic missiles to be another evidence that the Iskanders are running out (except for the inviolable reserve). It should also be noted that we have not seen the use of Tochka-U missiles by separatists or Russian forces for a long time.\n\n>An authoritative expert on arms control, including nuclear weapons, Jeffrey Lewis believes that it makes no sense not to transfer ATACMS missiles to Ukraine.\n\n>Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Nahman Shai said that after the news that Iran will hand over ballistic missiles to Russia, it is time for Israel to join Ukraine's most active allies and start helping it on an equal footing with the United States and NATO countries.\n\n>We believe that theoretically Israel could give Ukraine Harop drones, but we find it unlikely, since Russia still has levers of pressure on Israel. For example, Israeli organizations still existing in Russia, which can be closed. Or tacit agreements under which Russia limits the geographical influence of Iranians in Syria and prevents them from coming close to the Golan Heights.\n\n>Thus, since the supply of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia does not threaten Israel's security, we do not expect it to retaliate any modern powerful weapons to Ukraine.\n\n>Spain joins the supply of air defense equipment to Ukraine and transfers Hawk air defense systems of 1989, which is an approximate analogue of the Cube and S-125 complexes.\n\n>According to French Minister of the Armed Forces Sebastian Lecorne, France will train about 2,000 Ukrainian military personnel. France also plans to supply Ukraine with 6 more Caesar artillery units, Crotale air defense systems and several MLRS.\n\n>German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok assured Ukraine of further military support from Germany and noted that at present support for Ukrainian air defense is more important than the supply of German tanks.\n\n>The outgoing Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andriy Melnik said that Ukraine had asked Germany to create a \"European tank alliance\" that would allow Ukraine to transfer two hundred Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. We believe that this is unrealizable because, as a rule, European countries do not have tanks in storage. A more realistic option would be if Poland abandoned its \"Leopards\" and received \"Abrams\" from the United States, \"Leopards\" would be transferred to someone who wants to switch to them from the T-72, and the T-72 would go to Ukraine, where they already know how to use them. Additionally, you can pick up the T-72 from Kuwait and Morocco, also putting them on Abrams.\n\n>A number of countries, such as China and Egypt, have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine. We believe that these countries, like Serbia, have simply duplicated spring appeals to their citizens. There is no reason to believe that this is associated with new dangers.\n\n>There are videos with the movements of Russian forces on the territory of Belarus. According to our team, this may be due to the decision to train those mobilized at Belarusian landfills. According to the presidential decree, the autumn draft begins on November 1, during which it is planned to summon 120,000 conscripts, who have nowhere to train yet. Russian landfills are crowded because 220,000 mobilized people were sent there, and the rest were sent to landfills in the occupied territories.\n\n>Some videos showed trains with Belarusian armored vehicles. The \"Belarusian Gayun\" project (like our team) is inclined to the fact that there is a rotation of Belarusian forces, not preparation for the invasion. Other videos show Russian automotive equipment (including trucks with military), but there are no armored vehicles. This is strikingly different from January 2022, when armored vehicles and artillery were transferred to Belarus to prepare for the offensive on Kiev.\n\n>The total number of Russian military personnel on the territory of Belarus will be just under 9 thousand people.\n\n>Zvezda TV channel shows how the mobilized on the basis of 61 separate Marine brigades are trained. We see training with self-propelled artillery units \"Cellation\" and DJI drones. It should be noted that these drones are not licensed to work with state secrets, so according to the documents they cannot be used in the troops.\n\n>Russian MiG-29 aircraft, which were stored in Millerovo and Kursk, were relocated to some other place. We believe that they will not be deconserved, but removed to protect them. \n\n\n\u2026",

I'm not going to call out anyone specific, but if you've been reading these threads, you will see the many comments that continually pop up about these fines. \n\nThese drones are effective against Saudi Arabia in large part due to the nature of the targets, and first strike advantage. That is to say, the US defense system wasn't designed to deal with this threat. That isn't the same as this threat not being treatable. \n\n\n2. That part is true. Although, I feel that these limited targets will require a lot of hits before they are sufficiently destroyed. \n\n\n3. They are cost efficient vs missiles. That doesn't mean that they are better. That means that iran has designed them to skip the hurdles that missiles solve. There is a gap in western tech right now that fits this, because again, these drones have weaknesses that can be exploited easily by an opponent, while missiles are a bit more complex. \n\n\n4. You really only need flak around the important targets. I am saying don't bother shooting down drones targeting apartment buildings. \n\n5. There was discussion on the thread today of drones dedicated to anti drone warfare. While I do think you can literally take a crop duster and retrofit it into a makeshift world war 1 fighter plane, and that wouldn't be terrible, the anti drone drones seem more promising. The idea that I'm going for here is similar to British use of warplanes to take down flying bombs during world war 2. Those bombs were more difficult and harder to detect than these drones from my understanding, but the British were successful, so I imagine likewise you can counter them this way with perhaps a noise warning detection system. What I'm really going at here is saying that if people hop onto the idea that you can have a cheap effective offensive system that explicitly skips several hurdles (such as speed, sound), then we should freely expect there to be a relatively cheap defense system. There's nothing special about these drones to make them immune to what missiles are usually far too fast to be effective against. Their slow speed opens a whole box against them. \n\n\n6. To make a c path from my understanding, they would need to be manually reprogrammed midlfight. I think the more practical thing is to have point defense systems at key targets, and a net around those areas. These things are VERY slow, so there is time to evaluate where it's heading, and whether or not it's a concern. It's about developing the system. I said iron dorm like system because I know it's not going to be a match, but a lot of these attacks have been against useless targets. If Ukraine is concerned about ammo usage, one of the most useful things they can do is to make sure they aren't wasting ammo against irrelevant targets. How they implement that is going to have to be done with those who have the ability to research these recent attacks the most.",

That is to say, the US defense system wasn&#39;t designed to deal with this threat. That isn&#39;t the same as this threat not being treatable. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>That part is true. Although, I feel that these limited targets will require a lot of hits before they are sufficiently destroyed. </p></li>\n<li><p>They are cost efficient vs missiles. That doesn&#39;t mean that they are better. That means that iran has designed them to skip the hurdles that missiles solve. There is a gap in western tech right now that fits this, because again, these drones have weaknesses that can be exploited easily by an opponent, while missiles are a bit more complex. </p></li>\n<li><p>You really only need flak around the important targets. I am saying don&#39;t bother shooting down drones targeting apartment buildings. </p></li>\n<li><p>There was discussion on the thread today of drones dedicated to anti drone warfare. While I do think you can literally take a crop duster and retrofit it into a makeshift world war 1 fighter plane, and that wouldn&#39;t be terrible, the anti drone drones seem more promising. The idea that I&#39;m going for here is similar to British use of warplanes to take down flying bombs during world war 2. Those bombs were more difficult and harder to detect than these drones from my understanding, but the British were successful, so I imagine likewise you can counter them this way with perhaps a noise warning detection system. What I&#39;m really going at here is saying that if people hop onto the idea that you can have a cheap effective offensive system that explicitly skips several hurdles (such as speed, sound), then we should freely expect there to be a relatively cheap defense system. There&#39;s nothing special about these drones to make them immune to what missiles are usually far too fast to be effective against. Their slow speed opens a whole box against them. </p></li>\n<li><p>To make a c path from my understanding, they would need to be manually reprogrammed midlfight. I think the more practical thing is to have point defense systems at key targets, and a net around those areas. These things are VERY slow, so there is time to evaluate where it&#39;s heading, and whether or not it&#39;s a concern. It&#39;s about developing the system. I said iron dorm like system because I know it&#39;s not going to be a match, but a lot of these attacks have been against useless targets. If Ukraine is concerned about ammo usage, one of the most useful things they can do is to make sure they aren&#39;t wasting ammo against irrelevant targets. How they implement that is going to have to be done with those who have the ability to research these recent attacks the most.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Second, as I stated in my original comment, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s inherently stupid for trained police officers/military to try to shoot down these drones. It&#39;s absolutely important to call out biases here, because context matters. Whataboutism is primarily related to justification. The Russian&#39;s doing it doesn&#39;t justify it, my reasoning for it does. People need to stop throwing around terms for the sake of sounding smart. No, not everything comparative is whataboutism, not everything critical is gaslighting.</p>\n</div>",

Those are manufactured fairly slowly and are very expensive, so it is feasible to intercept them, and even hitting targets with them may not be a good trade.\n\nThe Shaheds can be spammed nearly endlessly and are so cheap that destroying individual houses with them might be an even trade (and I think that dehousing people did work to reduce morale in WW2), and destroying infrastructure with them should be fairly effective.\n\nRussia is buying the drones from Iran right now. I think they will start making them soon. They are an extremely effective way of destroying Ukrainian infrastructure, and even an idiot should be able to make them, as all they are made of is likely plastic, maybe a few simple metal components, a cheap computer (could maybe use a smartphone or Raspberry Pi or something), a camera, a GPS, a small piston engine, and some explosives.

While modern cruise missiles feature sophisticated electronics and an expensive turbofan engine, Shaheds use simple electronics and a piston engine. Car factories can likely be converted into Shahed factories without too much difficulty. If Russia converts 1/3 of its car factories into Shahed factories, and assuming that it is equally easy to make a car and a Shahed drone, then Russia can make 500,000 Shaheds per year.\n\nShaheds weigh 200 kg and have a 40 kg warhead. 40kg is four times as much as a 155mm artillery shell. It\u2019s not quite as big as a bomb, but it will still make a crater several meters wide (more than enough to disrupt a railroad or blow up a power transmission pylon).\n\nYou don\u2019t attack large pieces of infrastructure with a single Shahed, but with dozens or hundreds.\n\nUkraine doesn\u2019t have an infinite amount of spare parts to repair their Soviet era electrical infrastructure with. Their ability to repair railways getting hit at multiple points, several times a day, every day, for months, is limited. They do not have the means to continuously fix their stuff forever, while Russia can make Shaheds forever.\n\nHow will transformers, generators, and pumps be replaced when the railroads are constantly being destroyed and land mines being dropped in the craters to slow repair?\n\nHow is Ukraine going to have enough trucks and gas to ship water into the cities like that? What is preventing Shaheds from flying along the roads and hitting the first truck they see? Are you going to station SPAAGs along every road? There aren\u2019t that many SPAAGs.\n\nShaheds are way more of a wunderwaffen than HIMARs. HIMARs is a mediocre piece of rocket artillery with few tubes, small and expensive rockets, short range, and limited munitions choices (no thermobaric or cluster munitions). Things like China\u2019s PHL-16 make HIMARs look like a joke.\n\nShaheds allow striking any target thousands of kilometers away, extremely cheaply, with an amount of munitions that is nearly impossible to destroy, from numerous angles. They are extremely hard to deal with. Numerous Shaheds can be made for the price of one SAM, so trying to destroy them with SAMs will just cause you to run out of SAMs. Ground based radars cannot even detect them at distance, because they can fly below the radar horizon. Planes may be able to detect them, but because of their small size and slow speed, they will have a hard time telling them from birds. Also, shooting them down with air to air missiles will deplete your stock of those, and shooting down a tiny drone moving at highway speeds using a fighter\u2019s gun will be hard. AA guns can shoot them down without much trouble, but stationing enough of them to protect every possible target is impossible. EW won\u2019t work, as they are likely just flying towards a pre-programmed target with no input, and even if it did, emitting large amounts of radiation is a good way to eat an anti-radiation missile. The best choice might be to chase them with attack helicopters, which can fly after them continuously and shoot at them for a long time, but getting enough of those to cover all of your land is hard.",
