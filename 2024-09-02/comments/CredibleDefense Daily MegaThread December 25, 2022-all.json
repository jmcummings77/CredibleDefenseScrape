They had almost half of China\u2019s population, same for the British Empire, and they were more than two times as populous as America. Up until the fall of the Soviet Union, they remained in the top 3. As of now they are the 9th most populous country in the world, with 1/10 of Chinese or Indian population, and less than half of American population. They have 1/3 of EU\u2019s population.

Soviet Union had the second or the third highest GDP for most of the Cold War. Now, once again, they are in the 9th place. And they are also predicted to fall even lower in this regard. \n\n\nNow we also know that their military is no longer the second  strongest force in the world, and honestly it is a question if they are even in the top 10.  With how much Europe is investing into military right now they certainly won\u2019t be in the top 10 for much longer. \n\n\nThis crisis may not be as big as some of the previous crisis they faced, but Russia isn\u2019t as strong as it used to be. And most predictions point to them only becoming weaker with time. They might recover from that war, but will they be able to catch up with the rest of the world powers and repair their destroyed reputation?

There are many such examples. Right now he's saying it will take about 3 months to break first wave of mobilization and Russia will need to do another wave, or fold. So it will probably take more like 4-6 months.\n\nThere are also a few things he's not allowed to talk about.
