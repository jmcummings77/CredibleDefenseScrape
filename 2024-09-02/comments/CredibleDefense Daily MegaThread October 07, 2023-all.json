      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Urban centres are dense, heavily confined, with tall high-rise buildings with all sorts of informal housing and infrastructure arrangements, and very tenuous water supplies. Potential strategic assets are either  deliberately placed in populated areas -- something that, most of the time, WWII nations tried to avoid if only in order to protect their economically-active civilian population -- or have been encroached by civilian buildings. Some inter-war ghettos or urban sprawl areas *kind of* looked like that, but not at that scale.\n\nIt's not that you *can't* effectively disrupt Hamas operations, it's not like strategic air force means and doctrine haven't improved in these eighty years, it's just that it seems very improbable that you can effectively strike any strategic assets without staggering loss of civilian life.

Urban centres are dense, heavily confined, with tall high-rise buildings with all sorts of informal housing and infrastructure arrangements, and very tenuous water supplies. Potential strategic assets are either  deliberately placed in populated areas -- something that, most of the time, WWII nations tried to avoid if only in order to protect their economically-active civilian population -- or have been encroached by civilian buildings. Some inter-war ghettos or urban sprawl areas <em>kind of</em> looked like that, but not at that scale.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not that you <em>can&#39;t</em> effectively disrupt Hamas operations, it&#39;s not like strategic air force means and doctrine haven&#39;t improved in these eighty years, it&#39;s just that it seems very improbable that you can effectively strike any strategic assets without staggering loss of civilian life.

Like if you ask people what do the hamas think of gay people, I doubt many would say &quot;yeah mate I believe Hamas respects gay people&quot;.</p>\n</div>",

It is a challenge for our national security doctrine.

First of all: nuclear capability.\"  \n  \n>Kalman is also very concerned about the conventional military strengthening of Iran, which is \"a discussion we're missing out on.\" It's not about tanks and artillery, mostly long-range missiles and rockets, many of them precise, cruise missiles, drones, advanced aerial defense weapon systems that could challenge the Israeli air force and more. \"Iran doesn't only produce for itself. It supplies its subordinates with precise capabilities, with cruise missiles, with aerial defense systems to deal with Israeli air force capabilities. What's made in Iran doesn't stay in Iran. It's immediately found in Syria, Lebanon, and maybe later on in Gaza.\"\n\nMore here: https://www.israelhayom.com/2021/03/29/israel-has-the-ability-to-completely-destroy-irans-nuclear-program/",

Tal Kalman, who heads the IDF&#39;s Iran Directorate, who addresses your question how Israel will deal with Iran.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Q: And yet, Iran is far from surrendering.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Iran is not a specific operational challenge, but a challenge one level above the military. It is a challenge for our national security doctrine. We had a tendency to be cynical in recent years, due to the idea that Iran is being pushed into the discussion for other things, but I really think this is about dealing with a country with the potential to become a regional power, headed by an extreme regime with a real goal of destroying Israel.  </p>\n\n<p>Dealing with Iran, he says, is based on four components. The first is the extreme regime, &quot;that as long as it rules Iran, Israel will have a major challenge.&quot; The second is the nuclear issue. The third is the military strengthening &quot;which is close to that of a regional power.&quot; And the fourth is the Iranian attempt to grow its regional influence &quot;that in the long run uses areas with lack of governance and establishes capabilities there.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The challenge that all these pose for Israel is unprecedented. &quot;The standard components of deterrence, defeat and defense are irrelevant for a country of 80 million people that are hundreds of miles away.

Although the Ukrainian military was unable to maintain control of the airfield, the National Guard conscripts delayed the assault long enough to prevent Russia from immediately using Hostomel airport as an airbridge. &quot;</p>\n\n<p>Also even after the initial Russian plan didn&#39;t work out Russia still could have arguably won the battle of Kyiv by changing their plans. </p>\n\n<p>The military had not planned the war over beforehand or made any plans for anything going wrong. It was because Putin and the FSB were personally dictating over the military and preventing them from planning accordingly to doctrine. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ukraine lacked suitable defenses and defensive forces on the city\u2019s western side during the first week of the war, but the Russian military failed to adapt, sticking with the original plan to assault from Hostomel into the city center.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If Putin had told the Russian military beforehand about the invasion and gave them more than 3 days to prepare or the few Ukrainian decisions such as to blow the dam hadn&#39;t been made it could have gone the other way </p>\n\n<p>It was not non-credible to suggest that it could have happened before the invasion or now.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2023/08/the-battle-of-hostomel-airport-a-key-moment-in-russias-defeat-in-kyiv/\">https://warontherocks.com/2023/08/the-battle-of-hostomel-airport-a-key-moment-in-russias-defeat-in-kyiv/</a></p>\n</div>",

Roughly speaking, you can expect a 3:1 advantage for Russia. However Russia has a long border to manage against NATO, China and Japan, so there\u2019s always going to be a considerable amount of units deployed to these sectors. Plus a considerable amount of units who need to be on standby to prevent internal disruption or infighting between political factions.

We can also infer that at least the UK government was willing to call the bluff because it immediately began supplying anti-tank weapons (ie NLAW) to Ukraine in the thousands, and that was always more credible because the UK military had heavily co-operated with Ukraine and trained Ukrainian soldiers between 2015-2022 via Operation ORBITAL. \n\nAt the bare minimum, any successful Russian invasion of Ukraine would need at least 3-4 months assuming everything goes perfectly. And we can assume it already didn\u2019t go perfectly; the US and the UK publicly detailed intelligence which provided Ukraine months to prepare. Furthermore, there\u2019s a lot of emphasis in your comment about the heroics in the Kyiv defence and unluckiness of the Russian advance and the failings at Hostomel. But this equally applies to Ukraine. For example, under no circumstances should the Southern advance into Kherson, be as successful as it was. Ukraine had the perfect opportunity to hold Russian forces across three chokeholds, and could had blown bridges at the Chongar Strait and Heniches\u2019k, and mine the areas surrounding Armiansk.

That it\u2019s a terrorist group, proscribed both by the\u00a0United States\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union? That it rules Gaza\u00a0with an iron fist? That it\u2019s killed hundreds of innocent Israelis with\u00a0rocket,\u00a0mortar, and\u00a0suicide\u00a0attacks?\n\n>But did you also know that Hamas \u2014 which is an\u00a0Arabic acronym\u00a0for \u201cIslamic Resistance Movement\u201d \u2014 would probably not exist today were it not for the Jewish state? That the Israelis helped turn a bunch of fringe Palestinian Islamists in the late 1970s into one of the world\u2019s most notorious militant groups? That Hamas is\u00a0blowback?\n\n>This isn\u2019t a conspiracy theory. Listen to former Israeli officials such as Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev, who was the Israeli military governor in Gaza in the early 1980s. Segev later\u00a0told\u00a0a New York Times reporter that he had helped finance the Palestinian Islamist movement as a \u201ccounterweight\u201d to the secularists and leftists of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Fatah party, led by Yasser Arafat (who himself\u00a0referred\u00a0to Hamas as \u201ca creature of Israel.\u201d)\n\n>\u201cThe Israeli government gave me a budget,\u201d the retired brigadier general confessed, \u201cand the military government gives to the mosques.\u201d\n\n>\u201cHamas, to my great regret, is Israel\u2019s creation,\u201d Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades,\u00a0told\u00a0the Wall Street Journal in 2009. Back in the mid-1980s, Cohen even wrote an official report to his superiors warning them not to play divide-and-rule in the Occupied Territories, by backing Palestinian Islamists against Palestinian secularists. \u201cI \u2026 suggest focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before this reality jumps in our face,\u201d he wrote.\n\n>They didn\u2019t listen to him. And Hamas, as I explain in the fifth installment of my\u00a0short film series\u00a0for The Intercept on blowback, was the result. To be clear: First, the Israelis\u00a0helped build up\u00a0a militant strain of Palestinian political Islam, in the form of Hamas and its Muslim Brotherhood precursors; then, the Israelis switched tack and tried to\u00a0bomb,\u00a0besiege, and blockade\u00a0it out of existence.\n\n>In the past decade alone, Israel has gone to war with Hamas three times \u2014 in 2009, 2012, and 2014 \u2014 killing\u00a0around 2,500 Palestinian civilians\u00a0in Gaza in the process. Meanwhile, Hamas has killed far more Israeli civilians than any secular Palestinian militant group. This is the human cost of blowback.\n\n>\u201cWhen I look back at the chain of events, I think we made a mistake,\u201d David Hacham, a former Arab affairs expert in the Israeli military who was based in Gaza in the 1980s,\u00a0later remarked. \u201cBut at the time, nobody thought about the possible results.\u201d\nThey never do, do they?\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/",

That it\u2019s killed hundreds of innocent Israelis with\u00a0rocket,\u00a0mortar, and\u00a0suicide\u00a0attacks?</p>\n\n<p>But did you also know that Hamas \u2014 which is an\u00a0Arabic acronym\u00a0for \u201cIslamic Resistance Movement\u201d \u2014 would probably not exist today were it not for the Jewish state? That the Israelis helped turn a bunch of fringe Palestinian Islamists in the late 1970s into one of the world\u2019s most notorious militant groups? That Hamas is\u00a0blowback?</p>\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a conspiracy theory. Listen to former Israeli officials such as Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev, who was the Israeli military governor in Gaza in the early 1980s. Segev later\u00a0told\u00a0a New York Times reporter that he had helped finance the Palestinian Islamist movement as a \u201ccounterweight\u201d to the secularists and leftists of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Fatah party, led by Yasser Arafat (who himself\u00a0referred\u00a0to Hamas as \u201ca creature of Israel.\u201d)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Israeli government gave me a budget,\u201d the retired brigadier general confessed, \u201cand the military government gives to the mosques.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHamas, to my great regret, is Israel\u2019s creation,\u201d Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades,\u00a0told\u00a0the Wall Street Journal in 2009. Back in the mid-1980s, Cohen even wrote an official report to his superiors warning them not to play divide-and-rule in the Occupied Territories, by backing Palestinian Islamists against Palestinian secularists. \u201cI \u2026 suggest focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before this reality jumps in our face,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n<p>They didn\u2019t listen to him. And Hamas, as I explain in the fifth installment of my\u00a0short film series\u00a0for The Intercept on blowback, was the result. To be clear: First, the Israelis\u00a0helped build up\u00a0a militant strain of Palestinian political Islam, in the form of Hamas and its Muslim Brotherhood precursors; then, the Israelis switched tack and tried to\u00a0bomb,\u00a0besiege, and blockade\u00a0it out of existence.</p>\n\n<p>In the past decade alone, Israel has gone to war with Hamas three times \u2014 in 2009, 2012, and 2014 \u2014 killing\u00a0around 2,500 Palestinian civilians\u00a0in Gaza in the process. Meanwhile, Hamas has killed far more Israeli civilians than any secular Palestinian militant group. This is the human cost of blowback.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I look back at the chain of events, I think we made a mistake,\u201d David Hacham, a former Arab affairs expert in the Israeli military who was based in Gaza in the 1980s,\u00a0later remarked. \u201cBut at the time, nobody thought about the possible results.\u201d\nThey never do, do they?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/\">https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/</a></p>\n</div>",

Anyway, those coordinated bombings had such a strong effect on Russia that it effectively forced Russia to invade Chechnya (which was apparently planned as late as December 1998). It propelled Putin to power and permanently changed Russia's national security strategy. Hundreds of Russians killed and an invasion followed. It solidified Putin's power.\n\nGranted the El Paso attack wasn't on Mexican soil but involved dead Mexicans. It pissed off the entirety of the Mexican population and gave Lopez Obrador an excuse to pass sweeping national security reforms and increase the power of the military in Mexico. Jingoism and a polarized political climate soon followed, white nationalist terrorists could not be tolerated so close to the homefront. \n\nIt makes me wonder what the political fallout is going to be. Some conspiracies are going on that it's a big plan by Bibi to solidify power but that makes no sense as he's trying to get the Saudi Arabia deal done. Most likely Israel's NatSec apparatus is dysfunctional with all the judicial reform chaos going on. Either this destroys Bibi entirely because he allowed this fuck up to happen or he gets stronger. We've seen this with Putin, Erdogan, Lopez Obrador, Bush, etc. Though the opposite happened with Neville Chamberlain and Francois Hollande.\n\nShit is beyond fucked man.",
