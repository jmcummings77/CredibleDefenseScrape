There is a relative calm in Synkyvka, probably also due to the integration of (part of?) the 6th CAA of the Leningrad MD into the Group of Forces \u201cNorth\u201d. The Ukrainian 116th Mechanized Brigade was transferred to this sector from the rear of the Orikhiv sector in late April, probably to make up for the weakening of the Ukrainian grouping here, after the transfer of the 41st and 115th Mech Brigades and of elements of the 67th Mech Brigade and of the 95th Air Assault Brigade to other sectors, over the last month and a half. In addition, according to my finding on Ukrainian social media, the artillery group of the 42nd Mech Brigade was likely moved in the Kupyansk sector.\n \nThe 272nd Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA of the Moscow MD today released a video which was supposedly geolocated in the south-western part of Kotlyarivka - if confirmed, a sign that the Russians likely entirely occupied the village. \n\nhttps://t. me/infomil_live/6249\n\nhttps://t. me/militarysummary/13348\n\n\nThere's still an Ukrainian presence in the western end of Kyslivka, at the moment. By gaining the heights around these two villages (which are the watershed between the Pischana and the Kobylka - the Russians already controlled Hill 204, the highest point of these heights), the Russians gained an additional access to the valley of the Pischana (a tributary of the Oskil), which could allow them to advance towards Road P07 and force the Ukrainians to abandon the fortifications north of Tabaivka, that had been instrumental in stopping Russian attacks from there after their breakthrough in January. This is not a dramatic situation, but the Russians will have to be stopped in the heights located above the spring of the Pischana, to prevent them from dangerously approaching the Oskil. The 1st Tank Regiment and the 15th Motorized Regiment of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st GTA are trying to attack towards Berestove, without success.\n \nSvatove sector. According to the Ukrainian observer Mashovets, the 27th Motorized Brigade of the 1st GTA is trying to attack Stelmakhivka from the north-east and the 423rd Motorized Regiment of the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA from the south-east, but in both cases without success. Attacks by the 252nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division of the 20th CAA of the Moscow MD against Makiivka were repulsed, too. This village is defended by the 66th Mechanized Brigade, which was recently reinforced by the 107th TDF Brigade.\n \nKreminna sector. All the four maneuver regiments of the 144th Motorized Division of the 20th CAA are in action against Terny and Yampolivka, along with elements of the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th CAA of the Central MD, but there haven't been serious Russian successes since mid-March. The Russians have never been able to gain positions in the forested ravines to the east of Yampolivka and the terrain east of these often changes hands. A counterattack by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade (to which the 23rd Separate Rifle Battalion is attached) recovered around 1 km of ground between Yampolivka and Torske. Elements of the well-known 3rd Assault Brigade have been in action in Terny since mid-April.\n \nSiversk sector. Elements of the 3rd Tank Brigade were moved to Bilohirivka to support the 81st Airmobile Brigade, which is successfully holding its positions in the area of the chalk quarry against the attacks by the 7th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps. The 6th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps tried to attack the positions of the \"Rubizh\" Brigade of the National Guard near Spirne, but without success.\n \nBakhmut sector. The 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps of the Leningrad MD is trying to advance towards Hryhorivka, without success. Elements of the 98th VDV Division and of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps (primarily the \u201cSt. George\u201d Assault and Recon Brigade) are trying to advance towards Kalinina, without success. The cattle breeding buildings between Bohdanivka and Kalinina and the fortifications around them are definitely still in Ukrainian hands as of yesterday; the Ukrainian 56th Motorized Brigade and a battalion of the 24th Mechanized Brigade are active in the area. \n \nThe bulk of the 98th VDV Division continues its attacks to penetrate the Kanal District of Chasiv Yar and the area immediately around it. There is currently no evidence of Russian control over a single building in Chasiv Yar, including those east of the intersection of Zelena Street with Horbatoho Street, nor over the garages or the holiday cottages to the north of the district. Kir Sazonov, a soldier of the 41st Mechanized Brigade, wrote that yesterday was a very hard day in terms of Russian artillery shelling against Chasiv Yar and there were new assaults (which occur both during day and night), but they were all repulsed, thanks to the determination of the soldiers of the brigade, even though the Russians got closer to the built-up area. There's a shortage of men and shells - Sazonov brings the example of a position that should be defended by 15-20 soldiers but is manned by only 9 men, but he urges not to exaggerate: there are obviously men to defend and the situation regarding shells is improving. The mortars of the 41st Mech Brigade have been crucial, along with FPV drones, in repelling Russian attacks.\n \nhttps://t. me/Kirilovolodimirovich/8161\n \nThe 98th VDV Division has been attacking for the past 6 months, and Mashovets pointed out, during his interview yesterday on 5 Kanal's YouTube page (I thank YT's subtitles, although far from being perfect), that some of its subunits have lost attack capability and are in need of replenishments. In fact, during the last month, numerous MIA notices of soldiers from the division have come out, and also quite a few obituaries of officers, particularly from the 331st Airborne Regiment - the one involved the most in the actions against the Kanal District. Mashovets also thinks that elements of the 76th VDV Division will arrive in the Bakhmut sector (let's recall that a few days ago he pointed out that an air assault battalion of the 76th VDV Division had been transferred from the Orikhiv sector to the Luhansk Oblast).\n \nThe 41st Mechanized Brigade (which received many soldiers expelled from the 67th Mechanized Brigade) is supported by elements of the latter and by the 5th Assault Brigade, and is perfoming well despite the difficulty of the task and the fact that, as Sazonov reported, the soldiers of the brigade were not happy at all to learn that they would be sent to Chasiv Yar, from the Kupyansk sector, in the last days of March. The 11th VDV Brigade has not yet consolidated positions along the Donets-Donbas Canal in the forest area of the nature reserve to the south of the Kanal District (defended by the 18th \u201cSloviansk\u201d Brigade of the National Guard), while the units of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA of the Southern MD (i.e. the 102nd Motorized Regiment and elements of the 68th Tank Regiment) are still unable to dislodge the Ukrainians from their positions south-west of Ivanivske (defended by elements of the 92nd Assault Brigade), in order to achieve their goal of advancing along Highway T0504, in the direction of Stupochky (let's recall that the bridge of this highway over the canal had been blown up in March 2023). The area around Stupochy might be the one preferred by the Russians for an hypothetical bridgehead in the western bank of the canal. The Russians should have retaken most of the positions south of Ivanivske that the Ukrainians had liberated with a counterattack around 10 days ago.\n \nThe 88th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps received replenishments and was brought back in battle, attacking Klishchiivka from the east, achieving some minimal successes. The 83rd VDV Brigade also returned to action, against Andriivka, but without success. The 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps (made up of regiments of the Territorial Forces) is in the process of restoring combat capabilities after the (mostly unsuccessful) attacks of the recent months. Let's recall that the liquidation of the Ukrainian positions in the eastern bank of the canal in this area will be crucial for any advance in the western bank (in the direction of Stupochky), and especially for developing the northern flank of a hypothetical offensive operation against Toretsk.

            "body": "Avdiivka sector. Yesterday the Ukrainians abandoned Arkhanhelske. Today the 132nd Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps raised the Russian flag in a building in the northern part of this village. They also took control over the forest belt to the north-east of the village. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/5359\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/5366\n\nThe current status of the forest belt and O-shaped fortification west of Arkhanhelske, which are being attacked by the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA of the Central MD, is unclear. At the moment, the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA of the Central MD and the 433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA have significantly slowed their progress in their directions of advance (Novooleksandrivka and Prohres, respectively), although it's still too early to speak of stabilization. The Ukrainian observer Myroshnykov points out that the Russians have approached the outskirts of Novooleksandrivka (I assume from the east); however, stabilization measures are underway and the situation regarding shells is improving. He also reports an advance of several hundred meters towards Sokil; the current status of the large trench between Sokil and Soloviove is unclear (probably grey zone), and the forest belts to the north of the trench should still be in Ukrainian hands, despite the consolidation by the Russians in the the recent days over the forest belts to the north of Soloviove.\n \nAt the level of order of battle and Ukrainian reinforcements, I wrote about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1chkemt/credibledefense_daily_megathread_may_01_2024/l24em38/). As an update, the vast majority, if not the entirely, of the 142nd Infantry Brigade should now be in the Avdiivka sector; one/two battalions of the 95th Air Assault Brigade are here as well (while the 2nd and 13th Air Assault Battalions of this brigade as of a few days ago were still in the Kreminna sector), and a battalion of the 92nd Assault Brigade should also have arrived (there is a MIA notice), in addition to its \u201cAchilles\u201d UAV Battalion. Moreover, in the past month the 47th Artillery Brigade arrived in the rear of the sector, from the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, joining the 55th Artillery Brigade and the artillery groups of the other brigades. At least a battalion of the 114th TDF Brigade arrived in the area of responsibility of the 47th Mechanized Brigade - this Telegram channel today praised the resilience of the soldiers of the 114th TDF Brigade, according to the words of a soldier of the 47th Mech Brigade. \n\nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/2736\n\nIn addition, elements of the 42nd Mechanized Brigade have likely arrived in the Avdiivka sector (certainly its tank battalion), after a month and a half of rest, following battles in the Bakhmut sector. Its presence in this sector was also mentioned by the daily bullettins of the Russian MoD over the last week, which is generally reliable in identifying Ukrainian units. In addition, the 110th Mechanized Brigade is back in action in the Avdiivka sector - it was made official today by its UAV unit, but in the last week in Ukrainian socials there already were crowdfunding campaigns for this brigade, announcing its return to Avdiivka. \n\nhttps://t. me/BUAR110ombr/302\n\nPer the Russian MoD, it's active near Semenivka. The brigade had a 2 months and a half refitting to replenish its combat capabilities by integrating new recruits along with the veterans and the wounded from the Avdiivka battle returning now into action; it also received new equipment, including a batch of T-64BVs, getting a tank unit for the first time. \n\nAs for the new Ukrainian brigades, I'm monitoring but there is no evidence that they have been brought into battle, except for elements of the 5th Tank Brigade in the Orikhiv sector (only the rifle units, the tank units are waiting for the delivery of Leopard 1A5s). Several battalions of the 23rd Mech Brigade and probably of the 31st Mech Brigade have been moved to the rear for recovery.\n\nThe 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD has likely been brought into battle from Berdychi in the direction of Novopokrovske, between the 55th Mountain Brigade and the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA. The bulk of the division is active in the southern flank of Avdiivka (6th and 239th Tank Regiments, together with the 428th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, attached to the division); it's unclear where specifically the 80th Tank Regiment and the 348th and 1441st Regiments of the Territorial Forces (attached to the division) are engaged; probably elements of them are providing support in the sector and others are in restoration. In addition, the 3rd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade is providing support in the northern flank of Avdiivka and the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade in the southern flank.\n \nDeepState yesterday reported a Russian advance (by the 9th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps) of a handful of hundred meters inside Netailove (defended by the 59th Motorized Brigade); the clashes have now reached the area of the secondary school. The Russians continue their advance into the orchards between Pervomaiske and Nevelske, and the situation has become considerably complicated for the latter settlement, which at the moment is still entirely in Ukrainian hands. \n \nMarinka sector. The Russians (5th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps) today took the large brick factory located in the center of Krasnohorivka (defended by elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade, of the 109th and of the 111th TDF Brigades). \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/5371\n\nThis is certainly a negative development, as Krasnohorivka is a town of significant size and a stronghold for that section of the front. Its fall would mean serious problems for the entire valley of the Lozova River, until the Vovcha. \n \nAn UAF officer urges against laughing at Russian assaults via motorcycles, quads or Desertcross ATVs, which have intensified, particularly between Heorhiivka and Pobjeda. They are fast and small, and sometimes manage to catch the Ukrainians by surprise or at least not give them time to react and to call in artillery or drone support; ATGMs and FPV drones often fail to catch them, etc. Their goal is to conquer a position by taking the Ukrainians by surprise, trying to take the advantages of both the foot attacks and those of the mechanized attacks while limiting the disadvantages of both.\n \nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/2727\n \nIn any case, the 46th Airmobile Brigade and the 33rd Mechanized Brigade continued to repel Russian attacks towards Heorhiivka and Pobjeda, by elements of the 150th Motorized Division and of the 20th Motorized Division (8th CAA), respectively. Further south, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet and the 10th Tank Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division began attacks towards Paraskoviivka, coming within a few hundred meters of the first houses in the village. South-west of Novomykhailivka, the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps of the Eastern MD (reinforced by subunits of the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division of the same corps) is consolidating gains, moving in the direction of Kostyantynivka.\n \nVelyka Novosilka sector. Russian attack operations continue, by the 37th Motorized Brigade and elements of the 5th Tank Brigade (both belonging to the 36th CAA of the Eastern MD), against Urozhaine, defended by the 58th Motorized Brigade and the 3rd Mech Battalion and the 20th Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. The Russians advanced a few hundred meters, capturing some depots on both sides of Road T05018 in the southern end of the village, but overall most of the extensive mechanized and armored attacks were repulsed.\n \nOrikhiv sector. The Russians control the southern and the western part of Robotyne, including the north-western end, after the advances by the 71st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Division (58th CAA, Southern MD) of the last week. Serious Russian Telegram channels deny that they have complete control over the (ruins of the) village. \n\nIn the last week, interestingly, the 7th VDV Division seems to be focusing on Robotyne (whereas until now it covered the area between Novopokrovka and Verbove). This is a further indication of the gradual disengagement of the 76th VDV Division from this sector. Russian pressure continues between Robotyne and Verbove and north-west of Verbove, but overall without successes. \n \nKherson sector / Dnipro River. The Ukrainians (mainly elements of the 35th and 37th Marine Brigades) have extended their control into the area of the village to the south-east of the museum. The Russians involved in the attacks against Ukrainian positions are mainly the 328th Air Assault Regiment of the 104th VDV Division and the 28th Motorized Regiment of the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th CAA of the Southern MD. In the last period the Russians resumed using KABs against Krynky, after a substantial lull of several months. Both Mashovets and Kovalenko report that the 234th Air Assault Regiment of the 76th VDV Division arrived in Korsunka from the Orikihiv sector, probably with the aim of finally liquidating Ukrainian positions (at least those in the north-western part of Krynky).

Today the 132nd Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps raised the Russian flag in a building in the northern part of this village. They also took control over the forest belt to the north-east of the village. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/5359</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/5366</p>\n\n<p>The current status of the forest belt and O-shaped fortification west of Arkhanhelske, which are being attacked by the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA of the Central MD, is unclear. At the moment, the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA of the Central MD and the 433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA have significantly slowed their progress in their directions of advance (Novooleksandrivka and Prohres, respectively), although it&#39;s still too early to speak of stabilization. The Ukrainian observer Myroshnykov points out that the Russians have approached the outskirts of Novooleksandrivka (I assume from the east); however, stabilization measures are underway and the situation regarding shells is improving. He also reports an advance of several hundred meters towards Sokil; the current status of the large trench between Sokil and Soloviove is unclear (probably grey zone), and the forest belts to the north of the trench should still be in Ukrainian hands, despite the consolidation by the Russians in the the recent days over the forest belts to the north of Soloviove.</p>\n\n<p>At the level of order of battle and Ukrainian reinforcements, I wrote about that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1chkemt/credibledefense_daily_megathread_may_01_2024/l24em38/\">here</a>. As an update, the vast majority, if not the entirely, of the 142nd Infantry Brigade should now be in the Avdiivka sector; one/two battalions of the 95th Air Assault Brigade are here as well (while the 2nd and 13th Air Assault Battalions of this brigade as of a few days ago were still in the Kreminna sector), and a battalion of the 92nd Assault Brigade should also have arrived (there is a MIA notice), in addition to its \u201cAchilles\u201d UAV Battalion. Moreover, in the past month the 47th Artillery Brigade arrived in the rear of the sector, from the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, joining the 55th Artillery Brigade and the artillery groups of the other brigades. At least a battalion of the 114th TDF Brigade arrived in the area of responsibility of the 47th Mechanized Brigade - this Telegram channel today praised the resilience of the soldiers of the 114th TDF Brigade, according to the words of a soldier of the 47th Mech Brigade. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/officer_alex33/2736</p>\n\n<p>In addition, elements of the 42nd Mechanized Brigade have likely arrived in the Avdiivka sector (certainly its tank battalion), after a month and a half of rest, following battles in the Bakhmut sector. Its presence in this sector was also mentioned by the daily bullettins of the Russian MoD over the last week, which is generally reliable in identifying Ukrainian units. In addition, the 110th Mechanized Brigade is back in action in the Avdiivka sector - it was made official today by its UAV unit, but in the last week in Ukrainian socials there already were crowdfunding campaigns for this brigade, announcing its return to Avdiivka. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/BUAR110ombr/302</p>\n\n<p>Per the Russian MoD, it&#39;s active near Semenivka. The brigade had a 2 months and a half refitting to replenish its combat capabilities by integrating new recruits along with the veterans and the wounded from the Avdiivka battle returning now into action; it also received new equipment, including a batch of T-64BVs, getting a tank unit for the first time. </p>\n\n<p>As for the new Ukrainian brigades, I&#39;m monitoring but there is no evidence that they have been brought into battle, except for elements of the 5th Tank Brigade in the Orikhiv sector (only the rifle units, the tank units are waiting for the delivery of Leopard 1A5s). Several battalions of the 23rd Mech Brigade and probably of the 31st Mech Brigade have been moved to the rear for recovery.</p>\n\n<p>The 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division of the Central MD has likely been brought into battle from Berdychi in the direction of Novopokrovske, between the 55th Mountain Brigade and the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA. The bulk of the division is active in the southern flank of Avdiivka (6th and 239th Tank Regiments, together with the 428th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, attached to the division); it&#39;s unclear where specifically the 80th Tank Regiment and the 348th and 1441st Regiments of the Territorial Forces (attached to the division) are engaged; probably elements of them are providing support in the sector and others are in restoration. In addition, the 3rd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade is providing support in the northern flank of Avdiivka and the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade in the southern flank.</p>\n\n<p>DeepState yesterday reported a Russian advance (by the 9th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps) of a handful of hundred meters inside Netailove (defended by the 59th Motorized Brigade); the clashes have now reached the area of the secondary school. The Russians continue their advance into the orchards between Pervomaiske and Nevelske, and the situation has become considerably complicated for the latter settlement, which at the moment is still entirely in Ukrainian hands. </p>\n\n<p>Marinka sector. The Russians (5th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps) today took the large brick factory located in the center of Krasnohorivka (defended by elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade, of the 109th and of the 111th TDF Brigades). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/5371</p>\n\n<p>This is certainly a negative development, as Krasnohorivka is a town of significant size and a stronghold for that section of the front. Its fall would mean serious problems for the entire valley of the Lozova River, until the Vovcha. </p>\n\n<p>An UAF officer urges against laughing at Russian assaults via motorcycles, quads or Desertcross ATVs, which have intensified, particularly between Heorhiivka and Pobjeda. They are fast and small, and sometimes manage to catch the Ukrainians by surprise or at least not give them time to react and to call in artillery or drone support; ATGMs and FPV drones often fail to catch them, etc. Their goal is to conquer a position by taking the Ukrainians by surprise, trying to take the advantages of both the foot attacks and those of the mechanized attacks while limiting the disadvantages of both.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/officer_alex33/2727</p>\n\n<p>In any case, the 46th Airmobile Brigade and the 33rd Mechanized Brigade continued to repel Russian attacks towards Heorhiivka and Pobjeda, by elements of the 150th Motorized Division and of the 20th Motorized Division (8th CAA), respectively. Further south, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet and the 10th Tank Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division began attacks towards Paraskoviivka, coming within a few hundred meters of the first houses in the village. South-west of Novomykhailivka, the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps of the Eastern MD (reinforced by subunits of the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division of the same corps) is consolidating gains, moving in the direction of Kostyantynivka.</p>\n\n<p>Velyka Novosilka sector. Russian attack operations continue, by the 37th Motorized Brigade and elements of the 5th Tank Brigade (both belonging to the 36th CAA of the Eastern MD), against Urozhaine, defended by the 58th Motorized Brigade and the 3rd Mech Battalion and the 20th Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. The Russians advanced a few hundred meters, capturing some depots on both sides of Road T05018 in the southern end of the village, but overall most of the extensive mechanized and armored attacks were repulsed.</p>\n\n<p>Orikhiv sector. The Russians control the southern and the western part of Robotyne, including the north-western end, after the advances by the 71st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Division (58th CAA, Southern MD) of the last week. Serious Russian Telegram channels deny that they have complete control over the (ruins of the) village. </p>\n\n<p>In the last week, interestingly, the 7th VDV Division seems to be focusing on Robotyne (whereas until now it covered the area between Novopokrovka and Verbove). This is a further indication of the gradual disengagement of the 76th VDV Division from this sector. Russian pressure continues between Robotyne and Verbove and north-west of Verbove, but overall without successes. </p>\n\n<p>Kherson sector / Dnipro River. The Ukrainians (mainly elements of the 35th and 37th Marine Brigades) have extended their control into the area of the village to the south-east of the museum. The Russians involved in the attacks against Ukrainian positions are mainly the 328th Air Assault Regiment of the 104th VDV Division and the 28th Motorized Regiment of the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th CAA of the Southern MD. In the last period the Russians resumed using KABs against Krynky, after a substantial lull of several months. Both Mashovets and Kovalenko report that the 234th Air Assault Regiment of the 76th VDV Division arrived in Korsunka from the Orikihiv sector, probably with the aim of finally liquidating Ukrainian positions (at least those in the north-western part of Krynky). Clashes and exchanges of heavy fire are also talking place on Nestryha Island, where the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade of the Arctic Fleet is trying to drive the Ukrainians out of the positions they had occupied over the past week.</p>\n</div>",

This is how Google Earth knows the elevation of anywhere on Earth because of radar mapping done by satellites.\n\n> Would the inherent nature of this guidace system limits its flexibility (i.e it can't make a detour to avoid AA threats pop up on its route?) \n\nThis would have been a problem for the early TERCOM systems, as the limited memory and processing power available meant the missile only had its own route recorded beforehand, so if it deviated from it's planned route it'd get immediately lost. However a modern system wouldn't have those restrictions as you could give it a map of the entire planet.\n\n> What if there's a sudden shift in the terrain below (i.e a landslide removes a chunk of dirt from a particular area along the route).

Because of their effectiveness and efficiency (there is also much less bureaucracy in their use, due to them being available at the battalion level).

The early end is an important element of the earlier coal phase-out envisaged in the coalition agreement.\n\n\n\n\nRegarding natural gas: Electricity feed-in from natural gas rose to a share of 13.6 % in 2023 (ca. 61.0 billion kilowatt hours), after falling to a multi-year low of 11.5 % in 2022 due to the tense situation on the gas market, but remained below the level of 2019 to 2021.\u00a0\n\n\nThe LNG terminals you mentioned are part of a diversification strategy and mainly fulfill the role of being more independent from current pipeline systems (Jamal, NS1 and Transgas are obviously the core issue, but solely being reliant on Europipe 1/2 and LNG terminals in Zeebr\u00fcgge or Rotterdam isn't without risk and struggle to fill the gap). That's why 4 FSRUs are being built or are already operational (Brunsb\u00fcttel, Wilhelmshaven I) as a rather temporary solution by the German Government, while Mukran gets another one from a private establishment. 3 of them are getting replaced by land based ports in 2027.\u00a0\n\n\nThe exact specification of capacities from 2030 is also subject to uncertainty, as the terminals still in operation at this time are largely in private hands and the federal government has no final information on the operating period and amount of capacity. On this basis, the capacity situation is expected to be between 47.5 and 52,5 billion cubic metres over the next fifteen years, independent from actual deliveries.\u00a0\n\n\nThe reason why Mukran for example is getting such a high capacity is because of the already existing unique natural gas infrastructure in Lubmin thanks to the Nord Stream 1 and 2 landfall points and the downstream OPAL and EU-GAL natural gas pipelines. These allow large quantities of gas to be fed into the pipeline network promptly and reliably without extensive expansion measures. Which allowed the FSRUs to be put into operation quickly and eastern Germany and neighbouring eastern European states without coastal access to be supplied with natural gas as well, which can't be understated from a security point of view.\n\n\nBut that's obviously all money and effort, which could've been used for direct climate change mitigation strategies and accelerate the expansion of renewable energies, as you already said.",

That is as you'd expect when a conflict has so many interested parties. \n\nUkraine has some unique dynamics going on - it's spectacular for a government to pass a law against their own right to negotiate in the first place. The same dynamics that created the ban would skewer anyone who secretly violated that ban. \n\nWe haven't heard a peep about negotiations since the ban was enacted for the simple fact that there are no negotiations. Zelensky lacks the political capital to reverse the ban, and the risk of exposure makes it too dangerous to negotiate while the ban remains in effect.

Took 75 years two world wars, and the destruction/occupation or Germany to finally solve the issue permanently (or so we hope).</p>\n</div>",
