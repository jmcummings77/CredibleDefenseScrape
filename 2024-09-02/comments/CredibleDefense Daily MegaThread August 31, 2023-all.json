Heinlein believed for all the high tech and destructive toys humans develop, at the end of the day if you want to hold and control land and people, you need the poor bloody infantry. He wrote:\n\n> There are a dozen different ways of delivering destruction in impersonal wholesale, via ships and missiles of one sort or another, catastrophes so widespread, so unselective, that the war is over because that nation or planet has ceased to exist. What we do is entirely different. We make war as personal as a punch in the nose. We can be selective, applying precisely the required amount of pressure at the specified point at a designated time\u2014we\u2019ve never been told to go down and kill or capture all left-handed redheads in a particular area, but if they tell us to, we can. We will.\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We\u2019re the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person. We\u2019ve been doing it, with changes in weapons but very little change in our trade, at least since the time five thousand years ago when the foot sloggers of Sargon the Great forced the Sumerians to cry \u201cUncle!\u201d\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>Maybe they\u2019ll be able to do without us someday. Maybe some mad genius with myopia, a bulging forehead, and a cybernetic mind will devise a weapon that can go down a hole, pick out the opposition, and force it to surrender or die\u2014without killing that gang of your own people they\u2019ve got imprisoned down there. I wouldn\u2019t know; I\u2019m not a genius, I\u2019m an M.I. In the meantime, until they build a machine to replace us, my mates can handle that job\u2014and I might be some help on it, too.\n\n\nYeah, you might say he had a high opinion of the infantry.",

He wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are a dozen different ways of delivering destruction in impersonal wholesale, via ships and missiles of one sort or another, catastrophes so widespread, so unselective, that the war is over because that nation or planet has ceased to exist. What we do is entirely different. We make war as personal as a punch in the nose. We can be selective, applying precisely the required amount of pressure at the specified point at a designated time\u2014we\u2019ve never been told to go down and kill or capture all left-handed redheads in a particular area, but if they tell us to, we can. We will.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We\u2019re the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person. We\u2019ve been doing it, with changes in weapons but very little change in our trade, at least since the time five thousand years ago when the foot sloggers of Sargon the Great forced the Sumerians to cry \u201cUncle!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Maybe they\u2019ll be able to do without us someday. Maybe some mad genius with myopia, a bulging forehead, and a cybernetic mind will devise a weapon that can go down a hole, pick out the opposition, and force it to surrender or die\u2014without killing that gang of your own people they\u2019ve got imprisoned down there. I wouldn\u2019t know; I\u2019m not a genius, I\u2019m an M.I. In the meantime, until they build a machine to replace us, my mates can handle that job\u2014and I might be some help on it, too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, you might say he had a high opinion of the infantry.</p>\n</div>",

So it is not deeply tied into organic transportation networks (to the extent Myanmar has those, which isn't much in the first place) and only has a handful of links to the outside world, which can be seized with a fairly small number of troops, just as the junta did in 2021. Meaning it wouldn't be storming a city so much as seizing control of a few critical transportation links in the middle of a big spread out suburb. The fact that the PDFs seem to be operating with impunity in the hinterlands around the capital suggests they will be able to seize control of the one railroad and the six or so major roads into the city, all of which run through some pretty rugged terrain for long, easily isolated sections that are susceptible to ambush. \n\nThat said, it's hard to imagine the junta permitting them to seize control of the city itself without putting up a very hard fight, and it would be challenging to take control of such a spread out space in the absence of great numerical superiority without excellent mobility, coordination, and surprise. So I agree with you in general that the NUG just don't seem to be there yet in terms of capability, but that doesn't mean that they won't be soon.\n\nIn terms of defectors alone, the PDF have something like just under a third the combat troops of the Tatmadaw. 20k versus 70k combat troops. Presuming they have been able to raise troops from other segments of the population (which seems evident from combat videos showing monks and others that do not seem trained even to Tatmadaw standards fighting), they may be closer to parity than is known. Moreover, they benefit from being able to attack anywhere, where the junta needs to defend everywhere. So if they can draw enough of the capital garrison away to deal with other issues, an assault on Naypyidaw may be within the realm of possibility. \n\nAlso considering the weather and assuming they have the necessary troops and capabilities, the PDF may be more likely to attack sometime before November even if they are not completely ready, simply because the Tatmadaw struggle with airstrikes during the rainy season. Which ends in November usually. Air strikes and artillery have been their primary advantages. Artillery can be choked off by cutting the supply lines into Naypyidaw, but the air advantage remains difficult for the PDFs to counter, so I could seem them feeling pressured into attacking before they are 100% ready, if they want to make something happen before the dry season.",

Either way, if a PDF unit sets up a checkpoint on one of the highways into the city or if they seize critical points like the rail depot, they will be particularly vulnerable to CAS or artillery because they will be tied to a single fixed, predictable location. It's much harder to chase down highly mobile and distributed insurgents in densely forested mountains exclusively with air power (which notably lacks any special ISR capabilities too), so they've instead been targeting civilians in a terror campaign designed to undermine support for the resistance. On the other hand, it's almost always easier to use long range fires during a positional defense, where all the critical positions are known to each side. So even poorly managed long range fires should be able to contribute in that environment. \n\n>  not sure the NUG is ready for an all out attack on the capital, but that's just my feeling.\n\nI'd agree. And I think they're more likely to go after Yangon when it comes down to it. It's the economic and political center of gravity of the country, and they would benefit from the denser built environment providing shelter against long range fires and a denser friendly local population to provide support in various ways, e.g. providing food, shelter, or information about Tatmadaw troop movements. And that would allow them to cut the Tatmadaw off from resupply by sea.

                "body": "> How does the resistance sustain funding and weaponry?\n\nFirst, there have been a large number of defectors from the Tatmadaw. Wikipedia says 16000 as of April 2022, so likely the numbers are higher. The Tatmadaw only have around 70k combat troops, for scale. Those defectors have almost certainly come with some amount of weaponry and ammunition. The various PDFs have also likely seized some amount in raids on Tatmadaw bases.\n\nSecond, the NUG and the PDFs almost certainly enjoy substantially more popularity than the junta, which seized power when it became clear they would not win any democratically elected positions in the government (they were still allocated 33 seats by the constitution). So the general population is definitely contributing in many ways, e.g. via funding or assistance establishing illicit supply routes. \n\nThird, many of the ethnic minority PDFs have been fighting against the central government for decades, and have robust connections to foreign suppliers via illicit border crossings to Thailand or Bangladesh. There are an enormous number of Shan or Karen  refugees in western Thailand, who maintain connections with many foreign parties, especially via the network of NGOs that assist refugees, [some of which have at times been credibly suspected of connections to foreign intelligence, such as the Free Burma Rangers, which was founded by an ex-special forces officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Burma_Rangers). \n\nFourth, Myanmar remains the second largest producer of opium in the world. However, most of that activity occurs in the golden triangle in the northeast of the country, under control of the descendants of a decimated Kuomintang army that was pushed across the border from China in the years after their civil war ended. They are generally apolitical as long as they are left alone to do their business, but certainly have access to funds and illicit smuggling channels to bring weaponry in. I personally doubt they are participating in this conflict, especially on behalf of the NUG, simply because they prosper more under a junta that cannot control the hinterlands than they would under a thriving rule of law democracy that might seek to bring Myanmar more in line with foreign legal standards. But it's certainly possible some of these smuggling channels are playing a role.\n\nAlso, I'd point out that the PDFs remain terribly equipped. They have access to small arms, but only of types which were available in Myanmar before the civil war. One of Myanmar's few functioning industries has been licensed production of western ammo types like 5.56, so the quantities needed to support the rebellion were absolutely available in country already. It only takes a few well-placed defectors to give the rebels access to enough small arms to equip tens of thousands. However, the PDFs have not demonstrated access to any of the more sophisticated systems that will be necessary to take on a reasonably supplied conventional military with artillery and air support, which suggests they are not receiving much foreign support if any, because that support would almost certainly focus on providing capabilities that can't be acquired locally. e.g., we are not seeing stingers appear on the battlefield despite the undeniable criticality of Tatmadaw air superiority. We are only seeing weaponry that is either locally source or deniable as locally sourced. So foreign support is not strong if it is there.\n\nFinally, and this point is hard to overstate, but the junta could not be more unpopular. The people of Myanmar are friendly and slow to anger, but when they get angry it is like a freight train. That's what happened in 2008 with the Saffron revolution. People are even angrier now, as demonstrated by their willingness to take up arms. There are 57 million people in Myanmar, compared to 150,000 in the Tatmadaw, of which only around 70k are combat troops. That means there are around 56 million angry people ready to help smuggle weapons across the border or to raid Tatmadaw armories or to report on Tatmadaw troop movements or a million other things that allow the PDFs to exert outsized pressure on the junta's forces. China may equip the junta with artillery and air power, but that can't compensate for just how little support the junta has among the people. So ultimately that's where all the funding and weaponry are coming from. An incredibly tiny minority of junta-aligned individuals benefit from the status quo, and the vast, overwhelming majority of the rest of the country hates them for it. You don't need foreign backers to get this kind of rebellion going in that environment.",

More missiles. More people.\"  \n>  \n>She said, through the initiative, the U.S. will augment its manufacturing and mobilization capabilities \"with our real comparative advantage, which is the innovation and spirit of our people.\"  \n>  \n>Even when mobilizing the U.S. economy and manufacturing base, rarely has the U.S. relied solely on its ability to match adversaries' scale alone, Hicks said.  \n>  \n>\"To stay ahead, we're going to create a new state of the art \u2014 just as America has before \u2014 leveraging attritable, autonomous systems in all domains \u2014 which are less expensive, put fewer people in the line of fire and can be changed, updated or improved with substantially shorter lead times,\" she said.  \n>  \n>**In doing so, Hicks said, the U.S. will counter the PRC's buildup, with \"mass of our own,\" that will be more difficult for adversaries to plan for and beat.**  \n>  \n>\"With smart people, smart concepts and smart technology, our military will be more nimble, with uplift and urgency from the commercial sector,\" she said.  \n>  \n>Hicks said those systems have proven to be lower cost alternatives to manned platforms and can be produced \"closer to the tactical edge.\"  \n>  \n>\"So now is the time to take all-domain, attritable autonomy to the next level: to produce and deliver capabilities to warfighters at the volume and velocity required to deter aggression, or win if we're forced to fight,\" she said.  \n>  \n>Attritable capabilities refer to platforms that are unmanned and built affordably, allowing commanders to tolerate a higher degree of risk in employing them.  \n>  \n>Under Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, defense leaders have deemed the PRC to be the United States' \"pacing challenge.\"  \n>  \n>The 2022 National Defense Strategy underscores the PRC's efforts to expand and modernize \"nearly every aspect\" of the People's Liberation Army as it aims to offset U.S. military advantages in the Indo-Pacific and, increasingly, around the globe.  \n>  \n>Navy Adm. John C. Aquilino, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, further highlighted the PRC's military buildup during his remarks at Wednesday's conference.  \n>  \n>\"They have focused very clearly on delivering a force capable to take on the United States,\" Aquilino said.  \n>  \n>\"We ought to look at the Chinese to understand truly where they are and what they're doing: the largest military buildup since World War II, both in conventional forces and in strategic nuclear \\[forces\\],\" he said.  \n>  \n>Aquilino said while the buildup is concerning, the U.S. focus on competing with the PRC is critical.  \n>  \n>\"The Deputy's words on the delivery of outcomes with speed is encouraging,\" he said.  \n>  \n>Hicks said during her remarks that the replicator initiative is focused not only on production, but on the whole-of-department approach to innovation and the ability to quickly field technology.  \n>  \n>Spotlight: Engineering in the DOD  \n>  \n>\"\\[W\\]hen the time is right, and when we apply enough leadership, energy, urgency and depth of focus, we can get it done,\" she said. \"That's what America does.  \n>  \n>\"We must ensure the PRC leadership wakes up every day, considers the risks of aggression and concludes, 'today is not the day' \u2014 and not just today, but every day, between now and 2027, 2035, 2049 and beyond,\" Hicks said.",

More people.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>She said, through the initiative, the U.S. will augment its manufacturing and mobilization capabilities &quot;with our real comparative advantage, which is the innovation and spirit of our people.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>Even when mobilizing the U.S. economy and manufacturing base, rarely has the U.S. relied solely on its ability to match adversaries&#39; scale alone, Hicks said.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;To stay ahead, we&#39;re going to create a new state of the art \u2014 just as America has before \u2014 leveraging attritable, autonomous systems in all domains \u2014 which are less expensive, put fewer people in the line of fire and can be changed, updated or improved with substantially shorter lead times,&quot; she said.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>In doing so, Hicks said, the U.S. will counter the PRC&#39;s buildup, with &quot;mass of our own,&quot; that will be more difficult for adversaries to plan for and beat.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;With smart people, smart concepts and smart technology, our military will be more nimble, with uplift and urgency from the commercial sector,&quot; she said.  </p>\n\n<p>Hicks said those systems have proven to be lower cost alternatives to manned platforms and can be produced &quot;closer to the tactical edge.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;So now is the time to take all-domain, attritable autonomy to the next level: to produce and deliver capabilities to warfighters at the volume and velocity required to deter aggression, or win if we&#39;re forced to fight,&quot; she said.  </p>\n\n<p>Attritable capabilities refer to platforms that are unmanned and built affordably, allowing commanders to tolerate a higher degree of risk in employing them.  </p>\n\n<p>Under Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, defense leaders have deemed the PRC to be the United States&#39; &quot;pacing challenge.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>The 2022 National Defense Strategy underscores the PRC&#39;s efforts to expand and modernize &quot;nearly every aspect&quot; of the People&#39;s Liberation Army as it aims to offset U.S. military advantages in the Indo-Pacific and, increasingly, around the globe.  </p>\n\n<p>Navy Adm. John C. Aquilino, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, further highlighted the PRC&#39;s military buildup during his remarks at Wednesday&#39;s conference.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;They have focused very clearly on delivering a force capable to take on the United States,&quot; Aquilino said.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;We ought to look at the Chinese to understand truly where they are and what they&#39;re doing: the largest military buildup since World War II, both in conventional forces and in strategic nuclear [forces],&quot; he said.  </p>\n\n<p>Aquilino said while the buildup is concerning, the U.S. focus on competing with the PRC is critical.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;The Deputy&#39;s words on the delivery of outcomes with speed is encouraging,&quot; he said.  </p>\n\n<p>Hicks said during her remarks that the replicator initiative is focused not only on production, but on the whole-of-department approach to innovation and the ability to quickly field technology.  </p>\n\n<p>Spotlight: Engineering in the DOD  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;[W]hen the time is right, and when we apply enough leadership, energy, urgency and depth of focus, we can get it done,&quot; she said. &quot;That&#39;s what America does.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;We must ensure the PRC leadership wakes up every day, considers the risks of aggression and concludes, &#39;today is not the day&#39; \u2014 and not just today, but every day, between now and 2027, 2035, 2049 and beyond,&quot; Hicks said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

For example, increased defense spending doesn't necessarily mean the workers or industrial inputs are there to produce what the government is ordering. So money that used to be sitting in a reserve account may be sitting in a defense contractor's account as they try and fail to hire for extra shifts (or in the MoD's account allocated for that line of acquisitions). Meaning that prepaid investment in the MIC does not necessarily translate into a finished good that will count toward GDP, and often the delivery of that good will come in a calendar year after the investment is made, since many military products have a long lead time in Russia's DIB.\n\nGiven that this is Russia we are discussing, large sums are also almost certainly being diverted for corrupt purposes at many points in the defense acquisition system as well. Money in Colonel Kleptovitch's savings account is also not contributing to GDP equally to funds stashed in the Kremlin's reserve account. Nor is that likely to return anything on the government's investment, which means the Russian ROI on defense spending may be substantially less than is common for other countries.\n\nThere are almost always unpredictable market distortions from this kind of enormous government stimulus, especially when the stimulus is focused on generating combat power rather than long term economic success. All of those new orders to the mining companies mean that there will be more need to hire from the same pool of disfavored ethnic minorities in peripheral regions who have formed the core of the Russian mobilization effort. Which will reduce the supply of mobilized personnel and/or any increased demand in the mining sector will not be possible to meet because of the lack of available labor. All of that labor gets pulled away from what were self-sustaining businesses before the war, chasing the rubles that come with defense contracts or responding to mobilization quotas, but those rubles will quickly dry up leaving them worse off than they were before the stimulus because now many of the organic, self-sustaining businesses have been destroyed by their inability to access labor. \n\nAlso somewhat notably, the US and EU still import large amounts of aluminum and other industrial metals from Russia, which has gone quietly undiscussed in the policy space, but also that means it is one of their few sanctions-proof sources of forex, so increased domestic consumption by the DIB could come at a significant cost in terms of their ability to raise cash they can spend abroad. Or if the resource extraction industry is capable of meeting the increased demand, they may just end up stockpiling warehouses with raw industrial inputs to their DIB which they lack the skilled personnel to efficiently convert into finished military products. \n\nOverall, we can expect to see lots of little asset bubbles popping up at the critical choke points in their defense industrial base. If the tank factory, the artillery factory, the truck factory, and the civilian construction sector all need a lot of steel and sanctions limit Russia to its own production, then probably we will see steel prices spike internally within Russia and any industrial suppliers capable of increasing production will attempt to do so while charging higher prices to balance out their increased marginal cost of production. They will also likely collect a hefty windfall in the process, which doesn't necessarily benefit either GDP or defense production.\n\nThese asset bubbles will inevitably cause runaway inflation because more money is being poured into the economy than it is capable of allocating to productive uses. Russia's economy is inflexible and brittle, and almost entirely reliant on resource extraction to keep it afloat, given that oil and gas alone account for something like 45% of the federal budget. The velocity of money is low, so even in relatively smoothly functioning industries it may spend a lot of time sitting in savings accounts rather than facilitating transactions. They *may* have the labor necessary to boost resource extraction to meet short-term demand from the defense spending, but they certainly do not have the skilled industrial labor or capital assets such as machine tools required to convert those extracted resources into finished products such as vehicles or weapons at scale, and are unlikely to dramatically change that reality without a generational investment in up-skilling their workforce, which is a strategy that they are clearly not pursuing at this time and which would take longer than this war is likely to last to bear any fruit. \n\nSo they are almost quite literally engaged in the Keynesian recommendation for the government to pay people to dig holes and fill them back in during a recession. Which boosts GDP in the year of the expense (2022 and 2023 for these defense expenditures), but yields no long term return on investment at all, not even in the next fiscal year. They *might* have a big pile of steel or aluminum available, but it will be converted into tanks at the same slow rate because no amount of rubles or dollars can improve the quality of the workforce on a short enough timeline to matter. And somewhat perversely, investing in resource extraction will pull skilled labor away from the factories.\n\nSome of these effects are fairly immediate, and can't really be cancelled out by stimulus spending.",

The Pentagon Wants to Hear From You](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-31/ufos-pentagon-sets-up-new-website-to-explain-report-sightings)\n\n>* Defense Department sets up website for unexplained sightings\n>* Effort comes amid calls for openness, accusations of coverup\n\n>The world\u2019s largest military says it\u2019s serious about investigating unexplained objects in America\u2019s skies and will ask service members \u2014 and eventually ordinary people \u2014 to submit what they think might be alien sightings.\n\n>That reporting feature will be included on a new a website \u2014 www.aaro.mil \u2014 that the Pentagon is launching as part of efforts to detail its work to get to the bottom of a slew of incidents in recent years. Those encounters have confounded the national security establishment and provoked accusations that the government is covering up what it knows.\n\n>The website will document the Defense Department\u2019s unclassified work on what it describes as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d and will offer links to reports, frequently asked questions and other data for alien hunters.\n\n>It will include a secure way to submit sightings \u201cfor consideration and review,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters Thursday. That feature is aimed at dispelling what some fighter pilots have said was a stigma against reporting what they believe could be encounters with extraterrestrial life.\n\n>Initially, only service members and civilian Pentagon employees will be able to submit reports.

Those encounters have confounded the national security establishment and provoked accusations that the government is covering up what it knows.</p>\n\n<p>The website will document the Defense Department\u2019s unclassified work on what it describes as \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena\u201d and will offer links to reports, frequently asked questions and other data for alien hunters.</p>\n\n<p>It will include a secure way to submit sightings \u201cfor consideration and review,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told reporters Thursday. That feature is aimed at dispelling what some fighter pilots have said was a stigma against reporting what they believe could be encounters with extraterrestrial life.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, only service members and civilian Pentagon employees will be able to submit reports.

Their processes N5/N4 are the most widely available advanced nodes, but N3 is just around the corner with next iPhones coming in couple of months, that's going to roughly double the transistor density so you are going to some big leaps. But they are not stopping there, they already have concrete plans for the next 5+ node advancements so their future is quite bright.\n\nThe field of advanced semiconductor manufacturing has shrank now only to 3 players, EUV and other advanced machines are just too expensive and R&D costs too high for small players to remain in the game. Samsung is about 1-2 years behind about in terms of mass production, but nodes are quite different from each other these days. Generally even if you can achieve same level of performance with a Samsung process, the chip is likely to use more power, be hotter and have worse yields. Lastly you have Intel, about a decade ago they were an undisputed leader in the advanced manufacturing, but because of troubles with advancing to the next process node they fell somewhat behind. Though now they do aim to catch up with TSMC by 2025-2027 and also they want switch to a fab model, so no longer will they make just Intel chips. It's a tough road for them ahead, but after a long time they now have an engineering CEO who gets it unlike past few ones who were only interested in profits. Oh you also have Japan trying to jump right into advanced manufacturing in next few years, the government is strongly pushing this and made a new company composed of various other big ones, it's very tall order, but Japan is the only country besides the existing ones that could possibly accomplish it. \n\nAs far as China goes, they are quite far behind in terms of mass manufacturing of advanced chips, about 5 generations behind, about 10-15 years, you have some PR stunts about them achieving 7nm or 14nm but 28nm is right now still the only one available for mass manufacturing. And that's before you reach the end point for you to need EUV machines which now they can't get and those machines took decade and half to develop. Also some countries (Japan) had high profile failures trying to develop them. There is no more advanced machine on the planet, and it's a minor miracle we as humanity managed to make one. In terms of manufacturing, unless political climate changes, they are looking at being left quite far behind.\n\nBut Taiwan is not just TSMC, it's Mediatek, Pegatron, Asus, Gigabyte, Acer, Realtek, MSI, Biostar and others. It's almost impossible to buy a computer these days and not have at least some part come from Taiwan, so the economic and political value will be always there, but while United States could manage to transition away from reliance on Taiwan, the implications of letting China gobble up the country goes far beyond the economic value of semiconductors. The entire concept of the US being the global security guarantor would be at risk, even though US never signed any official agreement with Taiwan, countries like SK and Japan expect the US to defend Taiwan and if it doesn't they'll act accordingly.",
