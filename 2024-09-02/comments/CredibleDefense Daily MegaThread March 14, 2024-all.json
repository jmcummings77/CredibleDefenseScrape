        "body": "An update on the order of battle in Ukraine.\n\nIn the Serebrianka Forest (Kreminna sector), elements of the 272nd Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st Tank Army of the Moscow Military District have gone into action, per the Ukrainian observer Mashovets. Already last month elements of the 153rd Tank Regiment of the same division had arrived in Kreminna along with the 347th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, with the aim of going into action in the Serebrianka Forest. In both cases they were moved from the Kupyansk sector, in the context that today a large part of the Kreminna sector has become the jurisdiction of the Group of Forces \"West\". \n\nThe purpose is clear: to fill the void left by the transfer of the entire 90th Tank Division of the Central MD to Avdiivka. Other minor elements of the 1st GTA are being transferred to the Kreminna sector to reinforce the offensive actions of the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army, Moscow MD) and of the 67th Motorized Division (25th Army, Central MD) in the direction of Terny and Yampolivka, where some new minor Russian successes were recorded in the recent days. This also suggests that at the moment Kupyansk (where the Russians have no progress around Synkivka and their advances around Tabaivka have been halted), has become a secondary front for the Russians, with priority given to Kreminna. Regarding the Ukrainians, the 96th and 98th Mech Battalions of the 60th Mech Brigade have arrived in Terny from Kupyansk, so the entire brigade is now deployed here. An UAV unit of the 93rd Mech Brigade is also active in the same area, and it seems some of the brigade's tanks are here too, which is strange since this brigade is already very busy around Bakhmut. \n\nAs I [had written](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1bah7i0/comment/ku43fzw/) last week, since late February the vast majority of the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army of the Central MD has been withdrawn to the rear, except for one battalion still active towards Orlivka (Avdiivka sector). Same identical situation for the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army (CMD). These brigades suffered greatly during the battle of Avdiivka in terms of losses, as did the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army and the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and, to a lesser extent, the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army and the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army, which are continually being replenished with men of the regiments of the Territorial Forces to remain in combat. Although the Russians continue to have significant human and material resources around Avdiivka, it remains to be seen until when they can continue to sustain the intensity of current actions. \n\nAs for the 21st Motorized Brigade, Mashovets wrote that the 27th Motorized Division, one of the new formations I had listed in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1aindfl/comment/kowvgzr/) last month, will be created on its basis. That it's going to be part of the 2nd Army was already clear - today we know that it will be created on the basis of the 21st Motorized Brigade, which in all likelihood will cease to exist. Until 2009 there was already the 27th Motorized Division, which was then reformed into the 21st Brigade. Today Russian intentions are to return to a divisional model, and one compromise to allow for the creation of new divisions is not to create them from scratch but on the basis of existing brigades. \n\nIt's therefore possible that the entirety of the brigade will be withdrawn and its remaining personnel and equipment will flow into the new 433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Division, currently undergoing training at the Trokhizbenka training camp, some 30 kms north-west of Luhansk, where they will have a refit and integrate new recruits and equipment. This regiment is to be ready by April 1 for Russian plans, with the likely goal of being taken into battle in the Avdiivka sector...\n\nMeanwhile in Totskoye (Orenburg Oblast) the 506th and 589th Motorized Regiments of the 27th Division are being formed. This is, after all, where the barracks of the 21st Brigade are based (and where most of the 67th Motorized Division was formed last year). The skeleton of the brigade present at the base will thus flow into these regiments, which will be staffed by the new contract soldiers undergoing training. The goal is to finish the training phase by June 1. The new division will also include the 268th Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment and the other usual support units, although it should not include a tank regiment, and will have an anti-aircraft missile battalion instead of a regiment. \n\nMashovets has always been extremely reliable about the pipeline of creation of new units and formations by the Russians. In early January he had mentioned the creation of the 44th Corps, which includes, for instance, the 72nd Motorized Division. Recently ads have appeared on Russian channels looking for contract servicemen for the 44th Corps, based in Luga (Leningrad Oblast). https://t. me/ordenbat/76 \n\nHe expresses serious doubts that the Russians will be able to meet the pre-set deadlines, mainly because of bottlenecks in equipment. The 27th Division will be equipped to 90% of its nominal requirements. In any case, there are perplexities that the bulk of the new Russian strategic reserves being formed will be combat-ready by this summer. \n\nFor the rest, in the Avdiivka sector there is increasing use of elements of the 90th Tank Division, i.e. the formation in the best condition right now in the area. From Russian sources, its 6th Tank Regiment is active in Tonenke, which like Orlivka, is now overwhelmingly in Russian hands, and it appears that some small units of this regiment were transferred to the 114th Motorized Brigade. Russian sources also report the arrival of the 99th Mech Battalion of the Ukrainian 61st Mech Brigade and additional elements of the 143rd Infantry Brigade in the sector. \n\nAs a reminder, the Russian 10th Tank Regiment was recently transferred from the organic subordination to the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps to the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th Army of the Southern MD. This regiment in recent days has been transferred to the operational sector of the 20th Motorized Division (previously it was active in Tonenke), which is now therefore fully deployed between Marinka and Novomykhailivka and has become a standard motorized division (three motorized regiments and one tank regiment), with the recent creation of the 242nd Motorized Regiment. So this is the tank regiment that arrived in the Marinka sector mentioned yesterday by the [spokesman] (https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/11/7445908/) of the OSG \"Tavria\", who said that the Russians are intensifying their efforts in both the latter sector and in Velyka Novosilka. \n\nIn the Velyka Novosilka sector, subunits of the 5th Tank Brigade of the 36th Army of the Eastern MD have recently been deployed to the section of the front held by the 60th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army of the Eastern MD, i.e. to the south of Staromaiorske, being transferred here from the rear of the other bank of the Mokri Yaly (which is the jurisdiction of the 36th Army). This brigade was an operational reserve during the summer counteroffensive in the sector, being deployed thereafter on a very limited basis. It represents one of the freshest and fully equipped units in the Russian Army, having around an hundred tanks according to Ukrainian estimates from this summer. \n\nLet's recall that the 1461st Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 36th Army) and detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade have also arrived to the south of Staromaiorske in recent weeks, and possibly assault companies of the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (currently in R&R near Berdiansk) will arrive too. All the units of the 127th Motorized Division of the 5th Army are currently active: the 394th Motorized Regiment in the direction of Staromaiorske (from the west), the 143rd Motorized Regiment in the direction of Rivnopil together with the 218th Tank Regiment, and the 114th Motorized Regiment lately has become quite active further west, in the direction of Chervone. In any case, it's possible that the Russians are planning something against Staromaiorske, which the Ukrainians liberated in late July. \n\nSyrsky today visited an Ukrainian command center in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and announced that despite the difficult situation, rotations are on the way. https://t. me/osirskiy/624\n\nActivity by the UAV unit of the new 5th Tank Brigade (in this case, the Ukrainian one!) in the Orikhiv sector was recorded today. https://t. me/ButusovPlus/8771\n\nRybar had mentioned last week that the 1st Rifle Battalion of the 5th Tank Brigade had arrived in Orikhiv, along with additional elements of the 141st Infantry Brigade, a battalion of the 101st TDF Brigade and elements of the new 154th Mech Brigade (the latter two have to be confirmed yet, but it could be part of the rotation Syrsky mentioned). Let's recall that Ukraine over the recent months has created a tank brigade and five mechanized brigades, which are to be deployed soon. Probably the rifle units of the 5th Tank Brigade are ready; one tank battalion has been formed with Slovenian M-55s, the others will likely have to wait for the delivery of Leopard 1A5s to complete their formation. The equipment shortage is no smaller than manpower's. \n\nMeanwhile, a [small expansion](https://militaryland.net/news/the-expansion-of-national-guard-continues/) in the National Guard continues. The 32nd Regiment has been reformed as the 17th Brigade and the 16th Battalion as the 34th Regiment. In any case, since a brigade of the NG consists of 3/4 maneuver battalions (2/3 in a regiment), we are talking about the creation of 2/3 additional battalions to the existing units, hardly something Ukraine can't afford even in the current situation.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An update on the order of battle in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>In the Serebrianka Forest (Kreminna sector), elements of the 272nd Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st Tank Army of the Moscow Military District have gone into action, per the Ukrainian observer Mashovets. Already last month elements of the 153rd Tank Regiment of the same division had arrived in Kreminna along with the 347th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, with the aim of going into action in the Serebrianka Forest. In both cases they were moved from the Kupyansk sector, in the context that today a large part of the Kreminna sector has become the jurisdiction of the Group of Forces &quot;West&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>The purpose is clear: to fill the void left by the transfer of the entire 90th Tank Division of the Central MD to Avdiivka. Other minor elements of the 1st GTA are being transferred to the Kreminna sector to reinforce the offensive actions of the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army, Moscow MD) and of the 67th Motorized Division (25th Army, Central MD) in the direction of Terny and Yampolivka, where some new minor Russian successes were recorded in the recent days. This also suggests that at the moment Kupyansk (where the Russians have no progress around Synkivka and their advances around Tabaivka have been halted), has become a secondary front for the Russians, with priority given to Kreminna. Regarding the Ukrainians, the 96th and 98th Mech Battalions of the 60th Mech Brigade have arrived in Terny from Kupyansk, so the entire brigade is now deployed here. An UAV unit of the 93rd Mech Brigade is also active in the same area, and it seems some of the brigade&#39;s tanks are here too, which is strange since this brigade is already very busy around Bakhmut. </p>\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1bah7i0/comment/ku43fzw/\">had written</a> last week, since late February the vast majority of the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army of the Central MD has been withdrawn to the rear, except for one battalion still active towards Orlivka (Avdiivka sector). Same identical situation for the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army (CMD). These brigades suffered greatly during the battle of Avdiivka in terms of losses, as did the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army and the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and, to a lesser extent, the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Army and the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army, which are continually being replenished with men of the regiments of the Territorial Forces to remain in combat. Although the Russians continue to have significant human and material resources around Avdiivka, it remains to be seen until when they can continue to sustain the intensity of current actions. </p>\n\n<p>As for the 21st Motorized Brigade, Mashovets wrote that the 27th Motorized Division, one of the new formations I had listed in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1aindfl/comment/kowvgzr/\">this comment</a> last month, will be created on its basis. That it&#39;s going to be part of the 2nd Army was already clear - today we know that it will be created on the basis of the 21st Motorized Brigade, which in all likelihood will cease to exist. Until 2009 there was already the 27th Motorized Division, which was then reformed into the 21st Brigade. Today Russian intentions are to return to a divisional model, and one compromise to allow for the creation of new divisions is not to create them from scratch but on the basis of existing brigades. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s therefore possible that the entirety of the brigade will be withdrawn and its remaining personnel and equipment will flow into the new 433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Division, currently undergoing training at the Trokhizbenka training camp, some 30 kms north-west of Luhansk, where they will have a refit and integrate new recruits and equipment. This regiment is to be ready by April 1 for Russian plans, with the likely goal of being taken into battle in the Avdiivka sector...</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile in Totskoye (Orenburg Oblast) the 506th and 589th Motorized Regiments of the 27th Division are being formed. This is, after all, where the barracks of the 21st Brigade are based (and where most of the 67th Motorized Division was formed last year). The skeleton of the brigade present at the base will thus flow into these regiments, which will be staffed by the new contract soldiers undergoing training. The goal is to finish the training phase by June 1. The new division will also include the 268th Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment and the other usual support units, although it should not include a tank regiment, and will have an anti-aircraft missile battalion instead of a regiment. </p>\n\n<p>Mashovets has always been extremely reliable about the pipeline of creation of new units and formations by the Russians. In early January he had mentioned the creation of the 44th Corps, which includes, for instance, the 72nd Motorized Division. Recently ads have appeared on Russian channels looking for contract servicemen for the 44th Corps, based in Luga (Leningrad Oblast). <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/ordenbat/76 </p>\n\n<p>He expresses serious doubts that the Russians will be able to meet the pre-set deadlines, mainly because of bottlenecks in equipment. The 27th Division will be equipped to 90% of its nominal requirements. In any case, there are perplexities that the bulk of the new Russian strategic reserves being formed will be combat-ready by this summer. </p>\n\n<p>For the rest, in the Avdiivka sector there is increasing use of elements of the 90th Tank Division, i.e. the formation in the best condition right now in the area. From Russian sources, its 6th Tank Regiment is active in Tonenke, which like Orlivka, is now overwhelmingly in Russian hands, and it appears that some small units of this regiment were transferred to the 114th Motorized Brigade. Russian sources also report the arrival of the 99th Mech Battalion of the Ukrainian 61st Mech Brigade and additional elements of the 143rd Infantry Brigade in the sector. </p>\n\n<p>As a reminder, the Russian 10th Tank Regiment was recently transferred from the organic subordination to the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps to the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th Army of the Southern MD. This regiment in recent days has been transferred to the operational sector of the 20th Motorized Division (previously it was active in Tonenke), which is now therefore fully deployed between Marinka and Novomykhailivka and has become a standard motorized division (three motorized regiments and one tank regiment), with the recent creation of the 242nd Motorized Regiment. So this is the tank regiment that arrived in the Marinka sector mentioned yesterday by the <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/11/7445908/\">spokesman</a> of the OSG &quot;Tavria&quot;, who said that the Russians are intensifying their efforts in both the latter sector and in Velyka Novosilka. </p>\n\n<p>In the Velyka Novosilka sector, subunits of the 5th Tank Brigade of the 36th Army of the Eastern MD have recently been deployed to the section of the front held by the 60th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army of the Eastern MD, i.e. to the south of Staromaiorske, being transferred here from the rear of the other bank of the Mokri Yaly (which is the jurisdiction of the 36th Army). This brigade was an operational reserve during the summer counteroffensive in the sector, being deployed thereafter on a very limited basis. It represents one of the freshest and fully equipped units in the Russian Army, having around an hundred tanks according to Ukrainian estimates from this summer. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s recall that the 1461st Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 36th Army) and detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade have also arrived to the south of Staromaiorske in recent weeks, and possibly assault companies of the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (currently in R&amp;R near Berdiansk) will arrive too. All the units of the 127th Motorized Division of the 5th Army are currently active: the 394th Motorized Regiment in the direction of Staromaiorske (from the west), the 143rd Motorized Regiment in the direction of Rivnopil together with the 218th Tank Regiment, and the 114th Motorized Regiment lately has become quite active further west, in the direction of Chervone. In any case, it&#39;s possible that the Russians are planning something against Staromaiorske, which the Ukrainians liberated in late July. </p>\n\n<p>Syrsky today visited an Ukrainian command center in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and announced that despite the difficult situation, rotations are on the way. <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/osirskiy/624</p>\n\n<p>Activity by the UAV unit of the new 5th Tank Brigade (in this case, the Ukrainian one!) in the Orikhiv sector was recorded today. <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/ButusovPlus/8771</p>\n\n<p>Rybar had mentioned last week that the 1st Rifle Battalion of the 5th Tank Brigade had arrived in Orikhiv, along with additional elements of the 141st Infantry Brigade, a battalion of the 101st TDF Brigade and elements of the new 154th Mech Brigade (the latter two have to be confirmed yet, but it could be part of the rotation Syrsky mentioned).

It means you could cease to exist as a result of this war. There is only one real party for which this war is existential - and that party is Ukraine. They are the only country that has to reckon with that possibility.\n\nLet's say Ukraine loses the war, Russia gets all their goals, replaces Ukrainian government, takes some territory, and so on.

Ukraine's move towards the West is perceived as a an ideological and security threat by Russia. This is in part because of Ukraine's size, its location directly bordering Russia, and its role as a buffer zone. The fear of losing influence in Ukraine is terrifying to Russian leaders. This is why they invaded immediately once Ukraine's new government came into power in 2014.\n\nThey did not invade the Baltics when the Baltics signaled they were aligning with the West. The Baltics are already a part of NATO and are much smaller and less important.\n\n3) Geostrategic Importance\n\nGeographically, Ukraine serves as a significant land buffer between Russia and NATO member states, has access to the Black Sea via the Crimean Peninsula (which is of critical naval and military significance to Russia), and hosts pipelines that carry Russian natural gas to Europe. Ukraine also has large amounts of both agricultural and industrial production - which has value to a country who needs to be self sufficient like Russia. \n\nThe Baltics, while strategically located on the Baltic Sea and acting as a bridge between the West and Russia, do not offer the same level of strategic depth, energy significance, or military leverage as Ukraine does to Russia.",

It comes as Moscow maintains an aggressively counter-Western foreign policy amid its\u00a0grinding war on Ukraine.\n\n>However, the Houthis have for weeks hinted about \u201csurprises\u201d they plan for the battles at sea to counter the United States and its allies, which have so far been able to down any missile or bomb-carrying drone that comes near their warships in Mideast waters.\n\n>Meanwhile, Iran and the U.S. reportedly held indirect talks in Oman, the first in months amid their long-simmering tensions over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program and attacks by its proxies.\n\n>Iran, the Houthis\u2019 main benefactor, claims to have a hypersonic missile\u00a0and has widely armed the rebels with the missiles they now use.

More interestingly, the fact that Russia's state media reports it first could point out to greater Russian involvement with the Houthis. The Russians might have realized that the Houthis successfully exploit a weak spot of the West with their operations in the Red Sea, and could be used to put greater pressure on it by bolstering Houthi capabilities, in tandem with Iran of course.\n\nPreviously, Russian relations with countries on the Persian Gulf prevented Moscow from bolstering its relations with the Houthis. But realizing that the Houthis are going nowhere, that Saudi is less interested in Yemen these days and that the Houthis present it with opportunities to inflict significant damage on the reputation and capabilities of western forces, at a time when the West is trying to find ways to provide Ukraine with more support.\n\nAs for the hypersonic missile that the Houthis reportedly have put their hands on. It could be either Kheybar Shekan or Fattah-1. Both missiles have high maneuverability and speed, which could get around western and Israeli AD systems. Either way, the Houthis managing to hit Israel with one of these missiles would be a huge escalation.\n\nIt begs the questions though, how on earth does Iran manage to supply the Houthis with these systems while Yemen is suffering from a blockade and is under great scrutiny the past few years.\n\nEdit: reaction by the Pentagon:\n\n>Kirby says media report the Houthis may have a hypersonic weapon are inaccurate: Those reports are inaccurate. There's absolutely no indication that the Houthis have had access to a hypersonic weapon.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lrozen/status/1768315899264549266?t=ffCS9dZb1zb2z6Z5kfUR4g&s=19",

It could be either Kheybar Shekan or Fattah-1. Both missiles have high maneuverability and speed, which could get around western and Israeli AD systems. Either way, the Houthis managing to hit Israel with one of these missiles would be a huge escalation.</p>\n\n<p>It begs the questions though, how on earth does Iran manage to supply the Houthis with these systems while Yemen is suffering from a blockade and is under great scrutiny the past few years.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: reaction by the Pentagon:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kirby says media report the Houthis may have a hypersonic weapon are inaccurate: Those reports are inaccurate. There&#39;s absolutely no indication that the Houthis have had access to a hypersonic weapon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/1768315899264549266?t=ffCS9dZb1zb2z6Z5kfUR4g&amp;s=19\">https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/1768315899264549266?t=ffCS9dZb1zb2z6Z5kfUR4g&amp;s=19</a></p>\n</div>",

It's been a long war, with a lot of discourse that's changed over time.\n\nThere's a bit of a shiny object syndrome that goes around the discourse. A year ago, after the leaks, everyone was worried that Ukraine would run out of air defenses in a few months and would be defeated by the VKS. Last summer, everyone was concerned about how to take out the KA-52's, but I haven't heard them mentioned in months.\n\nIt's not that these concerns don't have merit - increased VKS bombing has been a problem, as were the KA-52's - but that people tend to focus on them as the problem that Ukraine needs to overcome, the difference between victory and defeat. It seems hard for people to take a broader view of the war. I'm sure that if something happens to alleviate the manpower shortage, and then people suddenly realize that there are other things that are needed - training, equipment, artillery, vehicles, air defenses, drones, etc. \n\nIt also seems to be an issue of people not realizing that this is likely to be a long war. When you talked to people in 2022 about having large amounts of long term training, as well as prepping Ukraine with stuff like Abrams and F-16's for offensives a few years down the road, they'd tell you that the war would be over by then.",

        "body": "A lot of people are wondering why Ukraine aid keeps getting held up.  The reality is that a lot of conservatives are extremely sympathetic to Russia for religious reasons.  They believe there is a secular global elite that is out to promote moral values, especially around sexuality, that are antithetical to Christianity.  \n\nI subscribe to a religious magazine, First Things, as a holdover from the days when I was Catholic.  These guys have been promoting Russia hard.  I want to post this article from their August 2023 issue to give you guys a view into their mindset.\n\n[The article is called \"The Theopolitics of Ukraine\"](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2023/08/theopolitics-of-ukraine).\n\n> Does anyone imagine that Ukraine\u2019s successful integration into the Euro-\u00adAtlantic world would not lead to greater secularization? Who is naive enough to think that such an evolution would be \u201cnatural\u201d rather than imposed by the West? The cases of Hungary and Poland show that Washington and Brussels are quick to punish any resistance to secular progressivism.\n\n> Del Noce held that in order to live well, we need to be under \u201cthe spell of myths,\u201d and the task of reason is to discern which myths are true. This task has a political dimension. The \u201cidea of the \u00adholy city\u201d as an \u201cordering center,\u201d Del Noce argued, \u201cis essential for affirming the reality of the sacred.\u201d But in his lifetime, the West, obeying the atheist conclusions of nineteenth-century philosophy, had jettisoned any notion of an ordering center for society. \n\n> Beware laments that the re-sacralization of Western civilization is unfeasible, impracticable, or inexpedient. Such laments confirm the progressive conceit that history\u2019s judgment in favor of secularization is irreversible. To be sure, the encouragement given by Russia\u2019s leaders to a certain re-sacralization of Russian public life may be cynical. We should have no illusions about the ways in which political power can abuse the sacred in pursuit of its own ends. But let us not overlook Russia\u2019s achievement in the twenty-first century.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A lot of people are wondering why Ukraine aid keeps getting held up.  The reality is that a lot of conservatives are extremely sympathetic to Russia for religious reasons.  They believe there is a secular global elite that is out to promote moral values, especially around sexuality, that are antithetical to Christianity.  </p>\n\n<p>I subscribe to a religious magazine, First Things, as a holdover from the days when I was Catholic.  These guys have been promoting Russia hard.  I want to post this article from their August 2023 issue to give you guys a view into their mindset.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.firstthings.com/article/2023/08/theopolitics-of-ukraine\">The article is called &quot;The Theopolitics of Ukraine&quot;</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone imagine that Ukraine\u2019s successful integration into the Euro-\u00adAtlantic world would not lead to greater secularization? Who is naive enough to think that such an evolution would be \u201cnatural\u201d rather than imposed by the West? The cases of Hungary and Poland show that Washington and Brussels are quick to punish any resistance to secular progressivism.</p>\n\n<p>Del Noce held that in order to live well, we need to be under \u201cthe spell of myths,\u201d and the task of reason is to discern which myths are true. This task has a political dimension. The \u201cidea of the \u00adholy city\u201d as an \u201cordering center,\u201d Del Noce argued, \u201cis essential for affirming the reality of the sacred.\u201d But in his lifetime, the West, obeying the atheist conclusions of nineteenth-century philosophy, had jettisoned any notion of an ordering center for society. </p>\n\n<p>Beware laments that the re-sacralization of Western civilization is unfeasible, impracticable, or inexpedient. Such laments confirm the progressive conceit that history\u2019s judgment in favor of secularization is irreversible. To be sure, the encouragement given by Russia\u2019s leaders to a certain re-sacralization of Russian public life may be cynical. We should have no illusions about the ways in which political power can abuse the sacred in pursuit of its own ends. But let us not overlook Russia\u2019s achievement in the twenty-first century. Russian culture identifies a spiritual goal and norm for public life, the earthly counterpart of the holy city, and its name is not infrequently invoked in public discourse: Holy Rus. In this regard, Russian culture is closer to the truth than is the West\u2019s all too rigorous political atheism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I see below some comments wondering why Ukraine aid isn&#39;t a priority for Mike Johnson, the US speaker of the house.

Nicht, wenn man Rolf M\u00fctzenich glaubt, dem Fraktionschef der SPD-Bundestagsfraktion: \u201eDie Sozialdemokratie f\u00fchrt nur weiter, wof\u00fcr wir immer gestanden haben\u201c, sagt er der F.A.S. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Parteien, die Sicherheitspolitik allein \u00fcber milit\u00e4rische Fragen definierten, habe die SPD stets einen \u201ebreiteren Ansatz\u201c verfolgt. \u201eUnser Auftrag ist es, friedliche Verh\u00e4ltnisse zu bewahren.\u201c Aus dieser Position eine Wahlkampfauseinandersetzung herauszulesen, wolle er lieber anderen \u00fcberlassen. (...) \n\n> Machnig streitet nicht ab, dass es viele Leute in der SPD gibt, die es als \u201ewohltuend\u201c empfinden, dass der Kanzler zu einer \u201eso klaren Sprache\u201c in der Ukrainepolitik gefunden habe. Der Parteilinke Stegner macht keinen Hehl daraus, dass er in einer ausdr\u00fccklichen Friedenspolitik auch die Chance sieht, anderen Parteien W\u00e4hler abzujagen: \u201eWir sollten offensiv vertreten, dass wir auf keinen Fall zulassen werden, dass Deutschland in diesen Krieg hineingezogen wird. Damit verhindert man, dass Leute, die vor einem m\u00f6glichen Krieg Sorge haben, sich nur noch von AfD, der Linken und Frau Wagenknecht vertreten f\u00fchlen.\u201c\n\n---\n\n> \"The need to emphasize our tradition as a party of peace has become greater than it always was as a result of the war in Ukraine,\" says MP Ralf Stegner. He describes the SPD as \"the only party in the Bundestag that discusses this issue in a differentiated manner\" and sees this as a \"unique selling point\" suitable for election campaigns. In this respect, Stegner has no doubt \"that the question 'Who is the peace party?' will inevitably become a central issue in the domestic political debate\". (...)\n\n> Member of the Bundestag Axel Sch\u00e4fer praised Scholz, saying: \"He is sending a concise message that everyone can understand: no German soldiers in Ukraine. We can fight the election campaigns with that.\" Approval also comes from eastern Germany, where three state parliaments will be elected in the fall. Thuringia's Interior Minister Georg Maier, also a Social Democrat, puts it this way: \"The issue of war and peace can be decisive in elections, and if we don't show that democratic parties can deal with it, we will strengthen the extremists\". He adds: \"I fear that it will therefore not be possible to avoid these issues coming to the fore in the upcoming elections.\" (...)\n\n> Tendencies and statements cannot be ignored, but does it all add up to an election campaign strategy? Not if you believe Rolf M\u00fctzenich, the leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag: \"Social democracy is only continuing what we have always stood for,\" he told F.A.S. In contrast to other parties that define security policy solely in terms of military issues, the SPD has always pursued a \"broader approach\". \"Our mission is to preserve peaceful conditions.\" He would rather leave it to others to read an election campaign dispute out of this position. (...) \n\n> Machnig does not deny that there are many people in the SPD who find it \"beneficial\" that the Chancellor has found \"such clear language\" in his Ukraine policy. Stegner, who is on the left of the party, makes no secret of the fact that he also sees an explicit peace policy as an opportunity to win over voters from other parties: \"We should be proactive in stating that we will not allow Germany to be dragged into this war under any circumstances. This will prevent people who are worried about a possible war from only feeling represented by the AfD, the Left and Ms. Wagenknecht.\"\n\n[Source](https://archive.ph/8sQVR)\n\n> Noch bis vor Kurzem galt der Kanzler vielen Genossen als Problem, als blass und f\u00fchrungsschwach . Seit seiner Absage an Bodentruppen und seinem Nein zu Taurus schw\u00e4rmen sie in der SPD von ihm. \u00bbMit einem anderen Kanzler w\u00e4re Deutschland wahrscheinlich l\u00e4ngst Kriegspartei geworden\u00ab, sagt Bremens B\u00fcrgermeister Andreas Bovenschulte. Der Bundestagsabgeordnete Ralf Stegner zieht einen verwegenen historischen Vergleich: \u00bbAls George Bush Jr. den Irakkrieg begann, lehnte der sozialdemokratische Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schr\u00f6der die Beteiligung Deutschlands ab und hielt uns aus dem Krieg.\u00ab (...)\n\n> Klingbeil lobt Scholz f\u00fcr seine Taurus-Absage. Scholz sei es \u00bbegal, wie viele Leute an ihm zerren und eine Entscheidung fordern. Er sagt: Ich brauche so lange, wie ich brauche.\u00ab Kr\u00e4ftiger Applaus. Es gehe schlie\u00dflich um eine Frage von Krieg und Frieden, sagt Klingbeil. Andere w\u00fcrden gro\u00dfe Reden schwingen, aber: \u00bbIn 20 Jahren wird nicht der Name von Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann in Geschichtsb\u00fcchern stehen, sondern der Name Olaf Scholz.\u00ab\n\n---\n\n> Until recently, the Chancellor was seen by many comrades as a problem, as pale and lacking in leadership. Since his rejection of ground troops and his no to Taurus, they have been raving about him in the SPD. \"With a different chancellor, Germany would probably have long since become a party of war,\" says Bremen's mayor Andreas Bovenschulte. Member of the Bundestag Ralf Stegner draws a bold historical comparison: \"When George Bush Jr. started the Iraq war, the Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der rejected Germany's involvement and kept us out of the war.\" (...)\n\n> Klingbeil praises Scholz for his Taurus refusal. Scholz \"doesn't care how many people tug at him and demand a decision. He says: I need as long as I need.\" Strong applause. After all, it's a question of war and peace, says Klingbeil. Others would make grand speeches, but: \"In 20 years, it won't be Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann's name in the history books, but Olaf Scholz's.\" \n\n[Source](https://archive.ph/ejdmB)\n\nThe chancellor's office and party leadership are still denying a specific strategy, but embracing and nurturing the sentiment of Scholz protecting Germany from a hot war between Russia and NATO. Some party members do explicitly or implicitly see this as an election strategy. Many political commentators across a wide range of newspapers, from conservative [Handelsblatt](https://archive.ph/cFgrJ) to liberal [S\u00fcddeutsche](https://archive.ph/uL7ee) in Germany have arrived at a similar conclusion. \n\nI don't think we have to wait for a party to officially declare an angle \"their strategy\" before assigning it to them as outside observers. What parties claim to be and what they are can be two very different things.",

(...) </p>\n\n<p>Machnig streitet nicht ab, dass es viele Leute in der SPD gibt, die es als \u201ewohltuend\u201c empfinden, dass der Kanzler zu einer \u201eso klaren Sprache\u201c in der Ukrainepolitik gefunden habe. Der Parteilinke Stegner macht keinen Hehl daraus, dass er in einer ausdr\u00fccklichen Friedenspolitik auch die Chance sieht, anderen Parteien W\u00e4hler abzujagen: \u201eWir sollten offensiv vertreten, dass wir auf keinen Fall zulassen werden, dass Deutschland in diesen Krieg hineingezogen wird. Damit verhindert man, dass Leute, die vor einem m\u00f6glichen Krieg Sorge haben, sich nur noch von AfD, der Linken und Frau Wagenknecht vertreten f\u00fchlen.\u201c</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The need to emphasize our tradition as a party of peace has become greater than it always was as a result of the war in Ukraine,&quot; says MP Ralf Stegner. He describes the SPD as &quot;the only party in the Bundestag that discusses this issue in a differentiated manner&quot; and sees this as a &quot;unique selling point&quot; suitable for election campaigns. In this respect, Stegner has no doubt &quot;that the question &#39;Who is the peace party?&#39; will inevitably become a central issue in the domestic political debate&quot;. (...)</p>\n\n<p>Member of the Bundestag Axel Sch\u00e4fer praised Scholz, saying: &quot;He is sending a concise message that everyone can understand: no German soldiers in Ukraine. We can fight the election campaigns with that.&quot; Approval also comes from eastern Germany, where three state parliaments will be elected in the fall. Thuringia&#39;s Interior Minister Georg Maier, also a Social Democrat, puts it this way: &quot;The issue of war and peace can be decisive in elections, and if we don&#39;t show that democratic parties can deal with it, we will strengthen the extremists&quot;. He adds: &quot;I fear that it will therefore not be possible to avoid these issues coming to the fore in the upcoming elections.&quot; (...)</p>\n\n<p>Tendencies and statements cannot be ignored, but does it all add up to an election campaign strategy? Not if you believe Rolf M\u00fctzenich, the leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag: &quot;Social democracy is only continuing what we have always stood for,&quot; he told F.A.S. In contrast to other parties that define security policy solely in terms of military issues, the SPD has always pursued a &quot;broader approach&quot;. &quot;Our mission is to preserve peaceful conditions.&quot; He would rather leave it to others to read an election campaign dispute out of this position. (...) </p>\n\n<p>Machnig does not deny that there are many people in the SPD who find it &quot;beneficial&quot; that the Chancellor has found &quot;such clear language&quot; in his Ukraine policy. Stegner, who is on the left of the party, makes no secret of the fact that he also sees an explicit peace policy as an opportunity to win over voters from other parties: &quot;We should be proactive in stating that we will not allow Germany to be dragged into this war under any circumstances. This will prevent people who are worried about a possible war from only feeling represented by the AfD, the Left and Ms. Wagenknecht.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/8sQVR\">Source</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Noch bis vor Kurzem galt der Kanzler vielen Genossen als Problem, als blass und f\u00fchrungsschwach . Seit seiner Absage an Bodentruppen und seinem Nein zu Taurus schw\u00e4rmen sie in der SPD von ihm. \u00bbMit einem anderen Kanzler w\u00e4re Deutschland wahrscheinlich l\u00e4ngst Kriegspartei geworden\u00ab, sagt Bremens B\u00fcrgermeister Andreas Bovenschulte. Der Bundestagsabgeordnete Ralf Stegner zieht einen verwegenen historischen Vergleich: \u00bbAls George Bush Jr. den Irakkrieg begann, lehnte der sozialdemokratische Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schr\u00f6der die Beteiligung Deutschlands ab und hielt uns aus dem Krieg.\u00ab (...)</p>\n\n<p>Klingbeil lobt Scholz f\u00fcr seine Taurus-Absage. Scholz sei es \u00bbegal, wie viele Leute an ihm zerren und eine Entscheidung fordern. Er sagt: Ich brauche so lange, wie ich brauche.\u00ab Kr\u00e4ftiger Applaus. Es gehe schlie\u00dflich um eine Frage von Krieg und Frieden, sagt Klingbeil. Andere w\u00fcrden gro\u00dfe Reden schwingen, aber: \u00bbIn 20 Jahren wird nicht der Name von Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann in Geschichtsb\u00fcchern stehen, sondern der Name Olaf Scholz.\u00ab</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until recently, the Chancellor was seen by many comrades as a problem, as pale and lacking in leadership. Since his rejection of ground troops and his no to Taurus, they have been raving about him in the SPD. &quot;With a different chancellor, Germany would probably have long since become a party of war,&quot; says Bremen&#39;s mayor Andreas Bovenschulte. Member of the Bundestag Ralf Stegner draws a bold historical comparison: &quot;When George Bush Jr. started the Iraq war, the Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der rejected Germany&#39;s involvement and kept us out of the war.&quot; (...)</p>\n\n<p>Klingbeil praises Scholz for his Taurus refusal. Scholz &quot;doesn&#39;t care how many people tug at him and demand a decision. He says: I need as long as I need.&quot; Strong applause. After all, it&#39;s a question of war and peace, says Klingbeil. Others would make grand speeches, but: &quot;In 20 years, it won&#39;t be Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann&#39;s name in the history books, but Olaf Scholz&#39;s.&quot; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/ejdmB\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>The chancellor&#39;s office and party leadership are still denying a specific strategy, but embracing and nurturing the sentiment of Scholz protecting Germany from a hot war between Russia and NATO. Some party members do explicitly or implicitly see this as an election strategy. Many political commentators across a wide range of newspapers, from conservative <a href=\"https://archive.ph/cFgrJ\">Handelsblatt</a> to liberal <a href=\"https://archive.ph/uL7ee\">S\u00fcddeutsche</a> in Germany have arrived at a similar conclusion. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think we have to wait for a party to officially declare an angle &quot;their strategy&quot; before assigning it to them as outside observers. What parties claim to be and what they are can be two very different things.</p>\n</div>",
