                "body": "The ideology of the resistance groups depends completely on the resistance group in question. There are an awful lot of them, and it's always difficult to tell which ones are actually fighting on the ground vs talking shit on the toilet. \n\nBroadly speaking, you have two buckets of groups: the ethnic majority (Bamar) ones and the ethnic minority (everyone else) ones. The majority groups are optimistically called PDFs (People's Defense Force) and are allegedly comprised of mostly Bamar civilians who took up arms follows the military coup, collectively organized into a would-be shadow government called the NUG. In reality, PDF is a label that's been thrown around willy nilly\u2014is it even a real group, if it's real what is it fighting for, if it's fighting who is it taking orders from; the angry Bamar civilians had zero training or experience or equipment\u2014they still have precious little of all of those things even though they have improved somewhat; and the NUG is not quite entirely toothless\u2014just mostly so. In theory, the goal of the NUG is to establish a federal democratic system. We'll get to the reality of that later. \n\nThe minority groups, generally called EAOs (Ethnic Armed Organization) are a different story entirely. These are, by and large, battle-hardened groups and decently well-equipped (at least with small arms) who have fought against the national military on-and-off for decades. Some of them go all the way back to the 1950s when Burma became a state. They are, as the name implies, ethnic groups who seek more territory or autonomy or influence or basically just more power in a state dominated by the Bamar majority (~70% by population). Many of them are heavily involved in illegal mining, gambling, drug manufacturing, or other illicit activities which thrive in the borderlands and provide valuable funding for the EAOs. They have been willing to work with the NUG to some degree, insofar as their goal is both to overthrow the military junta, and some have been labelled PDFs, given training to aforementioned angry Bamar civilians, and fought alongside them. Not all, but some. They are for most intents and purposes the real muscle behind the resistance, but it should be noted that their cause predates the resistance by many decades and many are not exactly friendly towards the Bamar majority. \n\nAnd then we have a subset of the EAOs, mostly in the northeastern provinces of Shan and Kachin, which are Chinese-influenced. Some of them had ties to the old Communist Party of Burma, some of them are still Maoists (amusingly there's one called the People's Liberation Army [of Burma] and they are on bad terms with Beijing), some of them are ethnically Chinese, and some of them are simply opportunists. The most notable of them is the UWSA (United Wa State Army), which is by far the strongest of the EAOs and has been observed with Chinese APCs, MANPADs, SHORADs, and sundry equipment, though obviously older second or third-hand versions which are obsolete by modern standards. They are quite well organized and restrained (by EAO standards) and have stayed out of the civil war thus far. They also have plenty of Chinese or Chinese-derived small arms, both imported and manufactured locally, and have tacit permission to sell them and other equipment to their neighbors who are fighting the army (but none of the sophisticated stuff). The Brotherhood Alliance which launched the recent offensive that everyone is talking about falls squarely into this third group, though like most of the non-Wa groups, they are viewed as loose cannons by the Chinese and what meagre support they do get is usually Wa-directed.\n\nThat was the high-level picture. The details get very complicated very fast. Myanmar is, by most objective metrics, a complete mess and was indeed messy even when the Bamar-led NLD was in charge and backed by the Bamar-led military. Central authority was a matter of uneasy compromise at best, and skirmishes with EAOs common. Now that the majority has splintered into civil war, things have very much gotten out of hand.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The ideology of the resistance groups depends completely on the resistance group in question. There are an awful lot of them, and it&#39;s always difficult to tell which ones are actually fighting on the ground vs talking shit on the toilet. </p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, you have two buckets of groups: the ethnic majority (Bamar) ones and the ethnic minority (everyone else) ones. The majority groups are optimistically called PDFs (People&#39;s Defense Force) and are allegedly comprised of mostly Bamar civilians who took up arms follows the military coup, collectively organized into a would-be shadow government called the NUG. In reality, PDF is a label that&#39;s been thrown around willy nilly\u2014is it even a real group, if it&#39;s real what is it fighting for, if it&#39;s fighting who is it taking orders from; the angry Bamar civilians had zero training or experience or equipment\u2014they still have precious little of all of those things even though they have improved somewhat; and the NUG is not quite entirely toothless\u2014just mostly so. In theory, the goal of the NUG is to establish a federal democratic system. We&#39;ll get to the reality of that later. </p>\n\n<p>The minority groups, generally called EAOs (Ethnic Armed Organization) are a different story entirely. These are, by and large, battle-hardened groups and decently well-equipped (at least with small arms) who have fought against the national military on-and-off for decades. Some of them go all the way back to the 1950s when Burma became a state. They are, as the name implies, ethnic groups who seek more territory or autonomy or influence or basically just more power in a state dominated by the Bamar majority (~70% by population). Many of them are heavily involved in illegal mining, gambling, drug manufacturing, or other illicit activities which thrive in the borderlands and provide valuable funding for the EAOs. They have been willing to work with the NUG to some degree, insofar as their goal is both to overthrow the military junta, and some have been labelled PDFs, given training to aforementioned angry Bamar civilians, and fought alongside them. Not all, but some. They are for most intents and purposes the real muscle behind the resistance, but it should be noted that their cause predates the resistance by many decades and many are not exactly friendly towards the Bamar majority. </p>\n\n<p>And then we have a subset of the EAOs, mostly in the northeastern provinces of Shan and Kachin, which are Chinese-influenced. Some of them had ties to the old Communist Party of Burma, some of them are still Maoists (amusingly there&#39;s one called the People&#39;s Liberation Army [of Burma] and they are on bad terms with Beijing), some of them are ethnically Chinese, and some of them are simply opportunists. The most notable of them is the UWSA (United Wa State Army), which is by far the strongest of the EAOs and has been observed with Chinese APCs, MANPADs, SHORADs, and sundry equipment, though obviously older second or third-hand versions which are obsolete by modern standards. They are quite well organized and restrained (by EAO standards) and have stayed out of the civil war thus far. They also have plenty of Chinese or Chinese-derived small arms, both imported and manufactured locally, and have tacit permission to sell them and other equipment to their neighbors who are fighting the army (but none of the sophisticated stuff). The Brotherhood Alliance which launched the recent offensive that everyone is talking about falls squarely into this third group, though like most of the non-Wa groups, they are viewed as loose cannons by the Chinese and what meagre support they do get is usually Wa-directed.</p>\n\n<p>That was the high-level picture. The details get very complicated very fast. Myanmar is, by most objective metrics, a complete mess and was indeed messy even when the Bamar-led NLD was in charge and backed by the Bamar-led military. Central authority was a matter of uneasy compromise at best, and skirmishes with EAOs common. Now that the majority has splintered into civil war, things have very much gotten out of hand. What kind of government, if any, will eventually emerge from this mess is anyone&#39;s guess. But it does seem safe to assume that the country will be significantly more decentralized, autonomous, or even balkanized as the ethnic minorities have seen a huge increase in their relative power.</p>\n</div>",

So it won't be like last March in Bakhmut.\n\nAnd there is very little depth left too, only a few more kilometers and the Russians can start getting direct fire on key supply lines, which will dramatically weaken the overall UAF salient. \n\nSo just defending is going to be much harder in the near future, getting worse as the Russians advance. Potentially very bloody for the UAF too if they try to reinforce failing defenses when the situation becomes untenable.\n\nSo their only option isn't hold at all costs (which likely won't work) or even to counterattack to temporarily relieve pressure (can work, but limited long term effects), they need to try to end the encirclement threat on Avdiivka so they can move on and end this campaign and take Avdiivka off the list of operational weaknesses.\n\nWhich means the Ukrainians have to push at least one of the Russian flanking pincer axis mostly back to the old JFO line of contact. Better two than one, but the Russians are unlikely to outflank the city with one flank attack (though it's possible). \n\nSo that means a counteroffensive. One launched as soon as possible, with at least 2-4 new brigades sent to the area as reinforcements, probably more artillery brigades too. More importantly, it means making Avdiivka the strategic main effort, which means priority for supplies, replacements, etc. \n\nThat's a VERY high risk decision. \n\nIt'll likely mean giving up on the still ongoing Orikhiv axis attacks, as someone up high is still trying to reach advance there for some reason. The Dnieper crossing is actually pretty low scale, so that can likely keep going. But the Ukrainians in Luhansk, who have intel suggesting they might catch their own big Russian offensive, will lose resources too. \n\nAnd it'll mean interfering with whatever other future plans the top Ukrainian leadership have. Did they want to conserve ammo for a later offensive? Well, they can't conserve if they legitimately want to save Avdiivka. Did they want to conserve manpower? Not going to do that attacking to relieve Avdiivka either.\n\nAnd such an attack would need to be in the mud season and then the winter. A real sucky time to be on the attack. Very unpredictable weather too, and fun fact, rain, sleet, snow, and even fog will ground most drones.\n\nConsidering advances are only possible incrementally at this point, it'll be slow too. \n\nAnd then what happens if the attack fails? They commit all that, and  they still don't save the city. \n\nSo very risky.

It was small, very poorly funded, out of date for everything minus GBAD. Most of it's aircraft weren't flyable, of fighter/attack, even Zaluzhny says that prewar only 40 were operational. \n\nThey weren't trained much on anything but combat air patrol (very basics of BVR and ACM) and very limited ground strike, though not done in a coordinated fashion in conjunction with ground ops (non responsive to CAS). \n\nThey weren't trained for SEAD/DEAD, weren't trained to plan and carry out large strike packages, have no refuelers, no AWACs, don't have ground controllers (like a JTAC) embedded with every combat unit, etc.\n\nSince the war started, they've gotten worse, not better. Many of their best pilots were lost, which is problematic because prewar funding issues meant flight hours were limited so they didn't have lots of good pilots (most of theirs were field grade officers, major to colonel). \n\nThey've been extremely hindered in what operations they can perform since the war started due to Russian fighter CAP who have much better long range missiles allowing them to fly high and forward over their GBAD coverage to extend their control, forcing the Ukrainians to fly low and back over their GBAD coverage limiting their control. \n\nTo gain the level of air power necessary to change the war, to gain \"air superiority\" and exploit it, means the Ukrainian Air Force basically needs to become the United States Air Force.

It was small, very poorly funded, out of date for everything minus GBAD. Most of it&#39;s aircraft weren&#39;t flyable, of fighter/attack, even Zaluzhny says that prewar only 40 were operational. </p>\n\n<p>They weren&#39;t trained much on anything but combat air patrol (very basics of BVR and ACM) and very limited ground strike, though not done in a coordinated fashion in conjunction with ground ops (non responsive to CAS). </p>\n\n<p>They weren&#39;t trained for SEAD/DEAD, weren&#39;t trained to plan and carry out large strike packages, have no refuelers, no AWACs, don&#39;t have ground controllers (like a JTAC) embedded with every combat unit, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Since the war started, they&#39;ve gotten worse, not better. Many of their best pilots were lost, which is problematic because prewar funding issues meant flight hours were limited so they didn&#39;t have lots of good pilots (most of theirs were field grade officers, major to colonel). </p>\n\n<p>They&#39;ve been extremely hindered in what operations they can perform since the war started due to Russian fighter CAP who have much better long range missiles allowing them to fly high and forward over their GBAD coverage to extend their control, forcing the Ukrainians to fly low and back over their GBAD coverage limiting their control. </p>\n\n<p>To gain the level of air power necessary to change the war, to gain &quot;air superiority&quot; and exploit it, means the Ukrainian Air Force basically needs to become the United States Air Force. They need way more than some older models of the F16 with older variants of the AMRAAM missile. .</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;ll need to at least triple in size, probably more.

Is it 1 million dollars because that was the original cost? Is it 1 million dollars multiplied to take inflation into account?

What if adding extra capacity to an existing order helps bring the per-unit manufacturing cost down across the board due to the economics of scale, should that be factored in?

Is it something less than 1 million based on the fact that all that money was spent on US defense contractors that provide jobs to tax paying Americans (so in a way, money going from the left hand to the right hand so to speak). Does the answer depend on when we were planning on replacing said equipment? What if adding extra capacity to an existing order helps bring the per-unit manufacturing cost down across the board due to the economics of scale, should that be factored in? What about warheads that we would eventually have to <em>spend</em> money on to safely decommission? Does giving those to Ukraine count as money saved?</p>\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t tell by now, my point is that it\u2019s hard to even settle on a fair way to quantify an answer to your question. And that\u2019s probably why you haven\u2019t seen firm refutations.</p>\n</div>",

Medical devices stopped. Patients, especially those in intensive care, started to die,\u201d Mohammed Abu Selmia, the director of Shifa, told the AP. Abu Selmia claimed Israeli troops were \u201cshooting at anyone outside or inside the hospital,\u201d and prevented movement between the buildings in the apparently Hamas-controlled compound. The claim that Israeli troops were the sole source of fire could not be verified independently. Asked about reports of troops firing into the Shifa courtyard, Lt. Col. (Res.) Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, would only say that troops were \u201cin the midst of ongoing intense fighting against Hamas in the vicinity of the area in question.\u201d He said the military takes all feasible measures to prevent harm to Palestinian civilians.\n\nSeems like a pretty nasty situation, and probably not going to get better anytime soon. I can only hope the medical staff get the supplies and aid they need as soon as possible.\n\n---\n\nIn non-Middle East discussion:[ a good thread I don't think has been posted before](https://twitter.com/ChrisO_wiki/status/1722252940415787237), about \"company units\" in Russia's war against Ukraine.

Meanwhile,  <a href=\"https://aje.io/jmh2l8?update=2479538\">Al Jazeera has an interview with a doctor at Al-Shifa</a>, in which he states the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr Ashraf al-Qudra says relentless Israeli bombardment left al-Shifa medical facility without its last lifeline \u2013 a small electric generator.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere are wounded and dead lying on the ground at the gate of al-Shifa Hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Israeli army targets everything that moves in the hospital\u2019s courtyards.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Al-Qudra said the medical complex is out of service and the only way to save the wounded is by using primitive methods. \u201cWe are losing one wounded person after another, and five wounded people were recently martyred due to the lack of treatment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Al-Qudra also said:</p>\n\n<p>There are 20,000 people in al-Shifa complex, including displaced people, medical staff, and wounded people.\n    Al-Shifa has become \u201ca theatre\u201d for Israeli army operations.\n    \u201cWe appealed to several parties to stop what is happening around al-Shifa Medical Complex \u2013 to no avail.\u201d\n    \u201cWe need to support hospitals with medicine, medical supplies and fuel.\u201d </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/fierce-battles-as-idf-troops-close-in-on-gazas-shifa-hospital-said-to-house-hamas-hq/\">EDIT to add Times Of Israel reporting on this stuff.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;There is no electricity. Medical devices stopped. Patients, especially those in intensive care, started to die,\u201d Mohammed Abu Selmia, the director of Shifa, told the AP. Abu Selmia claimed Israeli troops were \u201cshooting at anyone outside or inside the hospital,\u201d and prevented movement between the buildings in the apparently Hamas-controlled compound. The claim that Israeli troops were the sole source of fire could not be verified independently. Asked about reports of troops firing into the Shifa courtyard, Lt. Col. (Res.) Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, would only say that troops were \u201cin the midst of ongoing intense fighting against Hamas in the vicinity of the area in question.\u201d He said the military takes all feasible measures to prevent harm to Palestinian civilians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems like a pretty nasty situation, and probably not going to get better anytime soon. I can only hope the medical staff get the supplies and aid they need as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>In non-Middle East discussion:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisO_wiki/status/1722252940415787237\"> a good thread I don&#39;t think has been posted before</a>, about &quot;company units&quot; in Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine. <a href=\"https://nitter.net/ChrisO_wiki/status/1722252940415787237\">Nitter link</a> for non twitter users. Talks about how the Transneft guys have been conscripted and sent into battle where they&#39;ve suffered heavy losses.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/9/russia-spends-millions-on-war-propaganda-films-most-are-box-office-bombs\">And another AJ article, this one about Russia&#39;s weird propaganda films about the war, which keep flopping.</a>. At least they still have a way to go before experiencing a loss on a propaganda film as embarassing as suffered by the FIFA movie.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Last November, the Culture Ministry allocated $395m for movies that would cover \u201cthe current confrontation with the ideologies of Nazism and fascism\u201d, the war in Ukraine and Russia\u2019s \u201cspiritual leaders and volunteers\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

That's why they signed that treaty that their leadership and most of Russia weren't planning to follow, but they needed time to rebuild their military. Once they did, and they were more cocky and ready, they started the maskirovka campaign that gave them sufficient Casus Belli to invade Chechnya. \n\n>Putin himself seemed worried enough about the political cost of mobilization that he delayed it too much.\n\nI'm not suggesting he's worry free about casualties. I don't think any Russian leader, minus Stalin, who were ever fully secure enough in power to ignore casualties.\n\nI just think that the Russians, due to their history and culture, are more okay sustaining huge losses during war as the cost of doing business, so to speak. And I'm far from unique in believing this. Even to the casual observer of Russian history (and that includes me) their tolerance to military suffering is known to date centuries back in the Czarist days at least, obviously under Soviet control, and then has been confirmed twice now with the Russian Federation. \n\nPutin never got to fully coup proof his regime (though I'd say he's pretty close to successful after the Prigozhin Mutiny), so definitely early on especially there was still the risk of political issues to enact mass mobilization due to heavy losses in his SMO. Which is why they've done so much to try to attract volunteers that has been unfortunately quite successful, despite their ridiculously heavy losses. Minus some social media mothers and wives groups that pop up, taking the casualties hasn't even been an issue for Putin. The issue is getting more troops to replace them.\n\nEither way, believe the possibility to defeat Russia through attrition was a bad assumption. Very chancy, with a very low probability to pay off.

That&#39;s why they signed that treaty that their leadership and most of Russia weren&#39;t planning to follow, but they needed time to rebuild their military. Once they did, and they were more cocky and ready, they started the maskirovka campaign that gave them sufficient Casus Belli to invade Chechnya. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Putin himself seemed worried enough about the political cost of mobilization that he delayed it too much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not suggesting he&#39;s worry free about casualties. I don&#39;t think any Russian leader, minus Stalin, who were ever fully secure enough in power to ignore casualties.</p>\n\n<p>I just think that the Russians, due to their history and culture, are more okay sustaining huge losses during war as the cost of doing business, so to speak. And I&#39;m far from unique in believing this. Even to the casual observer of Russian history (and that includes me) their tolerance to military suffering is known to date centuries back in the Czarist days at least, obviously under Soviet control, and then has been confirmed twice now with the Russian Federation. </p>\n\n<p>Putin never got to fully coup proof his regime (though I&#39;d say he&#39;s pretty close to successful after the Prigozhin Mutiny), so definitely early on especially there was still the risk of political issues to enact mass mobilization due to heavy losses in his SMO. Which is why they&#39;ve done so much to try to attract volunteers that has been unfortunately quite successful, despite their ridiculously heavy losses. Minus some social media mothers and wives groups that pop up, taking the casualties hasn&#39;t even been an issue for Putin. The issue is getting more troops to replace them.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, believe the possibility to defeat Russia through attrition was a bad assumption. Very chancy, with a very low probability to pay off. Basing a strategy off of it was pretty stupid.</p>\n</div>",
