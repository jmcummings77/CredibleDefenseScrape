Brent crude prices fell below $73 per barrel this week, and price declines in recent weeks erased all of the gains since the last voluntary OPEC+ cuts were announced in early April. The Saudi energy minister recently issued a warning to \u201cspeculators\u201d betting on deeper declines, which the market interpreted as a signal of potential cuts. Whether OPEC+ announces a steeper production cut or decides to stay the course this weekend, it faces a dilemma. Russia has failed to dial back production as promised in recent months, and maintaining credibility will be difficult without better compliance from Moscow.\n\n> ...\n\n> OPEC+ also seems keen to defend a higher price floor. Saudi Arabia is in the early stages of an economic transformation plan that depends on a massive state-led investment push. Its government budget fell into deficit in the first quarter of 2023, despite an increase in non-oil revenue, and Riyadh anticipates large capital expenditures this year. Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal breakeven price for 2023 is $81 per barrel, according to the International Monetary Fund. To be sure, Saudi Arabia would have no trouble absorbing budget deficits for several years. The kingdom still has about $410 billion in foreign exchange reserves, sufficient for nearly 30 months of import cover, although its reserves are now at the lowest level in more than a decade. But lower oil revenue certainly complicates Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending plans. An $80 per barrel market is much more comfortable for Saudi Arabia and its partners than $70 per barrel or below. OPEC+ may be more confident that the global economy can absorb slightly higher prices, with economy-wide inflation now less of an acute threat to growth in the United States and other markets.\n\n> ...\n\n> The problem for OPEC+ is that deeper production cuts without better Russian compliance would only hurt other producers\u2014and could well disincentivize others from adhering to the cuts if they regard Russia as a free rider. Russia\u2019s pivot in oil sales to India and China has also expanded its market share in those critical centers of demand growth, placing the Gulf producers at a disadvantage. (Gulf producers are exporting more crude to Europe and other markets to replace Russian volumes, but these are regions with flat to declining demand.)\n\nThat's quite a conundrum for OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular. The Gulf states are fully aware that they need to diversify their economies, which requires very large investments. However, they don't attract much foreign investment, so they need a high oil price.\n\nOn the other hand, Russia is desperate about money and hence takes market share from the Gulf states when they decrease their production. Making deals with Russia is difficult as Russia has a habit of breaking them, even with so-called allies. There's a reason why China prefers energy deals with Turkmenistan rather than Russia.\n\nWill be interesting to see what they do, especially if oil demand is weaker than expected.",

Both scenarios happen; any further analysis of this that doesn&#39;t make a quantitative comparison has no value. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The consequences on the battlefield could be just as bad. AI is not at the level it can replace soldiers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a serious red flag indicating you aren&#39;t thinking about AI and automation in a constructive way at all. Assuming a one for one replacements of humans with robots is naivety to the point of absurdity. It&#39;s not how the vast majority of automation in the past has happened, and it&#39;s not how the majority of future automation is likely to happen until we have human level artificial general intelligence. Which could be a long time away yet, and also isn&#39;t a necessary level of AI to completely reshape everything about the world we live in.</p>\n\n<p>In general, automation means that you use fewer humans to perform the same task, and/or that tasks that were previously too labour intensive to be economically feasible or even conceivable become common place.</p>\n</div>",
