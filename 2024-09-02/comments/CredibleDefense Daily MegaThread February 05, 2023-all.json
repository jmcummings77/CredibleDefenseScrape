If that visual IS a Phoenix ghost, the warhead looks around comparable to a Lancet to me. \n\nApparently 10 SB600s (unclear if 10 units or 10 munitions) were delivered back in November. A month later Lithuania signed an order for SB600 munitions, which I suspect is related to their performance in Ukraine.\n\nMy Strong suspicion is that neither PG or SB600 manufacturing had scaled in 2022. The Pentagon might've made a decision to select SB300 as Ukraine's primary light loitering munition and the PG as Ukraine's primary heavy loitering munition. The levels of announced munition might indicate contracted/provisioned units from the manufacturers, instead of delivered units. It does not make sense to me that Ukraine was, for example, deploying 121 PG units in April/May of 2022, I think we would've seen debris from the Russian side, or some (like, literally any) feedback from Ukrainian units involved with them.\n\n[Tyler Rogoway](https://twitter.com/Aviation_Intel/status/1618418960441176065), who spends much more time looking for this stuff than me, called this out a few days ago. It just doesn't seem possible to me that Ukraine has taken possession of several hundred PGs and just sat on them or used them without anything coming out about them. I think its also possible, but less likely, that the PG is a cover for procuring consumer drones and modifying them for combat. \n\nOne of the funnier things about the PG, the producing company [AEVEX](https://aevex.com/news/) has literally nothing about them on their website. Probably one of the largest contracts in this company's history and they don't mention it at all. That's a sure sign their main customer is the DoD, because who do they even need to advertise too? Its a sharp contrast from AeroVironment's aggressive marketing\n\nThe poles have also supposedly supplied Warmate loitering munitions, don't know what's going on there.",

The Pentagon might&#39;ve made a decision to select SB300 as Ukraine&#39;s primary light loitering munition and the PG as Ukraine&#39;s primary heavy loitering munition. The levels of announced munition might indicate contracted/provisioned units from the manufacturers, instead of delivered units. It does not make sense to me that Ukraine was, for example, deploying 121 PG units in April/May of 2022, I think we would&#39;ve seen debris from the Russian side, or some (like, literally any) feedback from Ukrainian units involved with them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aviation_Intel/status/1618418960441176065\">Tyler Rogoway</a>, who spends much more time looking for this stuff than me, called this out a few days ago. It just doesn&#39;t seem possible to me that Ukraine has taken possession of several hundred PGs and just sat on them or used them without anything coming out about them. I think its also possible, but less likely, that the PG is a cover for procuring consumer drones and modifying them for combat. </p>\n\n<p>One of the funnier things about the PG, the producing company <a href=\"https://aevex.com/news/\">AEVEX</a> has literally nothing about them on their website. Probably one of the largest contracts in this company&#39;s history and they don&#39;t mention it at all. That&#39;s a sure sign their main customer is the DoD, because who do they even need to advertise too? Its a sharp contrast from AeroVironment&#39;s aggressive marketing</p>\n\n<p>The poles have also supposedly supplied Warmate loitering munitions, don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on there.</p>\n</div>",

Static winter fighting favors the capabilities that Russia retains, i.e. a heavy advantage in artillery. Russia is not impotent, the still have a large and dangerous military.\n\nEdit: Also, Russian losses in the winter are less likely to be visually confirmed, because losses will be on the Russian side of the line.\n\n>\tEven if they exhaust the Russians, it is difficult to see where they get the reserves to exploit that.\n\nThat is a force generation problem, which favors Ukraine long term.

Being cut off from China\u2019s economy overnight will be devestating. Alongside the direct pain of shortages from losing Chinese manufacturing, and tanked revenues from losing the Chinese market, the equal (and likely greater) suffering wrought within China itself will affect the rest of the global economy, in turn hurting the US even more. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what sort of losses the US military will suffer, assuming it becomes a full-on shooting war, but so far I\u2019ve seen anything from \u201cmore painful than anything since Vietnam\u201d to \u201cUS military power crippled for the foreseeable future\u201d. The [CSIS Wargame](https://www.csis.org/analysis/first-battle-next-war-wargaming-chinese-invasion-taiwan), even in its more optimistic iterations, predicts multiple surface ships sunk (including a carrier or two), and 100+ planes lost. \n\nI hate to rely on only one source for that, but I\u2019m not aware of another unclassified wargame to look at.

But if the US is left turning inward to rebuild its military and reckon with the economic situation at home, there won\u2019t be much energy left to utilise its reinforced global hegemony, at which point one might ask just how hegemonic it would still be. \n\n\nUltimately, given that the US could be antagonising China much more than it currently is, and the lack of any Article-V-esque commitment to Taiwan\u2019s defence, I think there\u2019s some awareness at the top that a war could be quite bad, and therefore not as much desire for it compared to, say, a conflict with Iran.\n\n\nEDIT: incorrectly used \u201cOne China Policy\u201d as the name for the CPC\u2019s position on Taiwan",

But if the US is left turning inward to rebuild its military and reckon with the economic situation at home, there won\u2019t be much energy left to utilise its reinforced global hegemony, at which point one might ask just how hegemonic it would still be. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, given that the US could be antagonising China much more than it currently is, and the lack of any Article-V-esque commitment to Taiwan\u2019s defence, I think there\u2019s some awareness at the top that a war could be quite bad, and therefore not as much desire for it compared to, say, a conflict with Iran.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: incorrectly used \u201cOne China Policy\u201d as the name for the CPC\u2019s position on Taiwan</p>\n</div>",

US lawmakers are already demanding to know if the balloon\u2019s payload contains technology from the US or its allies, another person said. Both asked not to be identified because the administration doesn\u2019t want to reveal exactly what it suspects the balloon was carrying.\n\n>The balloon, said to be the size of at least two school buses, and its sensors are lying in 50 feet (15 meters) of water and scattered over a seven-mile (11-kilometer) area off Myrtle Beach. Divers and cranes operating from the surface were expected to haul it up in the coming days, potentially giving intelligence analysts crucial insight into Chinese spying capabilities. \n\n>China says it was nothing more than a weather-monitoring balloon that strayed off course, while the US insists it was much more, and part of a broader spying plan by the Chinese government. With that in mind, people familiar with the matter said the Biden administration was calibrating how severely and swiftly to retaliate.\n\n>In a sign of the new tensions likely to come, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sharpened its tone on Sunday and said it now reserves the right to respond after a US F-22 fighter jet popped the balloon with a Sidewinder missile and sent its payload crashing into the ocean. Beijing said the US violated international practices after an accidental incursion by the balloon. \u201cChina will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the company concerned, and reserves the right to make further responses if necessary,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n>The international back-and-forth was a reminder that while the balloon may have come crashing down, the bizarre spying saga that surrounded it is far from over. Biden will almost certainly make reference to the episode in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, another person familiar with the matter said.\n\n>>Blinken\u2019s Trip\n\n>One option is to send Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China with a much tougher message than the one he had planned to bring this week, before he postponed the trip when the balloon\u2019s presence over the US was disclosed. \n\n>People familiar with the matter said he didn\u2019t want to risk the public-relations disaster of landing in Beijing while the balloon was still in the air over US territory. But now the administration believes Blinken should return soon. They argue for a much tougher approach both on the balloon and evidence the US has that officials say shows Chinese companies have been quietly supporting Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine.\n\n>The episode is already ratcheting up pressure on the administration to push even harder with its existing strategy of trying to hobble China\u2019s ability to access an array of high-tech semiconductors used in sophisticated military applications, as well as the valuable equipment used to manufacture such chips. \n\n>And even if it doesn\u2019t spur specific new measures, the embarrassingly public act of alleged espionage has made it more difficult for the US and China to stabilize diplomatic ties over thorny issues such as Taiwan, particularly with the Biden administration facing growing pressure from critics and a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said senators will get a full classified briefing on Feb. 15, which will give the administration time to collect and sort through the evidence to back up its claim. \n\n>>\u201cThe bottom line here is that shooting down the balloon over water wasn\u2019t just the safest option, but it was the one that maximized our intel gain,\u201d Schumer said in a statement.\n\n>Balloons like the one blown apart Saturday are not uncommon, but this time the Chinese made a mistake by flying it low enough to be spotted by commercial pilots and people on the ground, according to one person familiar with the matter. Typically balloons like the one shot down fly above 80,000 feet and as high as 100,000 feet.\n\n>The administration has already faced fierce GOP criticism in recent days for being weak on China and not shooting down the balloon sooner. US officials argued that it simply wasn\u2019t safe to bring the floating orb down over land when it was carrying a large and heavy payload.\n\n>The administration may not feel the need to level any other immediate consequences on Beijing for the episode given that US officials are comfortable with their broader position in terms of competition with China. The person familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking on the matter cited work already underway on further export controls and tightened investment restrictions on strategic sectors in China.\n\n>Starting in October, the Biden administration rolled out tough export controls against China that have curtailed Beijing\u2019s ability to access high-end semiconductors, and the US has only closed the vice more tightly since \u2014 including signing up nations to the effort such as the Netherlands and Japan, whose firms manufacture some of those chips.",

If the rate at which equipment is supplied to Ukraine increases by a large amount, it will need to come from Europe. If Europe cannot provide it, then probably a long term stalemate ensues.</p>\n</div>",

In essence, it&#39;s likely very close to how the USN internally perceives Chinese shipbuilding:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chinese naval ship design and material quality is in many cases comparable to USN\nships, and China is quickly closing the gap in any areas of deficiency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

For all three of those, you rejected those reasons until they actually happened.  Supply situations are a common one, but oftentimes it's because the attacker finds a weakpoint in the line that makes the entire line obsolete.  That's what happened in Izium (both times) and that's what the Russians did in Soledar (despite Ukraine also having no shortage of troops).\n\nThe easiest way for the Russians to lose their gains in the Donbas would be if their materiel situation deteriorates further.  However, if the Ukrainians find a weakpoint in the line they can just use that to force Russian withdrawals.\n\nEither way, as I said, I don't expect the Russians to stand and defend Bakhmut proper if it comes to that.",

The UAF actually did commit their strategic reserve to launch their largest counteroffensive of 2022 in the Kherson bridgehead, and supposedly were actually planning something even larger, to cut the Land Bridge, [until the US talked them out of that](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/ukraine-us-wargames-counteroffensive/index.html). In the future, the UA govt could perform an actual deception plan to do the same thing or better. \n\nThink of OP Bagration in summer 1944, Germany had a MASSIVE force in the Eastern Front, were 100% expecting a major Red Army offensive, but thinned out the lines in Army Groups North and especially Center to focus on reinforcing Army Groups North Ukraine but also South Ukraine, the former of which got the bulk of the best panzer units and equipment because that was where the Soviet deception plan tricked the Germans into thinking the Red Army were going to attack in force. The Ukrainians can do the same thing again. \n\nEven if they can't succeed with them at the strategic level they can do it at will at the operational and tactical level, deception plans work. Maneuver warfare works, find weak points and attack them. Defensively, there are always weak points to be found, no matter how strong the defender is. \n\nFor instance, the boundaries between two defending units, especially at the higher tactical or operational level (brigades, divisions, corps) are notorious for being weak points because of difficulties tying flanks together, with communication, lack of coordination and planning between sister units, and the landmarks that those boundaries are often based on, placed where they shouldn't be. In WW2, the Germans focused so much of their tactical doctrine finding those boundaries and attacking them. Why can't Ukraine? Are we to believe the Russians are now experts at coordinating between units that aren't even in the same tactical chain of command? \n\nAlso, they can use intel to find out when relief in place rotations are occurring are another. The UAF bit off a large chunk of the eastern portion of the Kherson bridgehead in late October by attacking a Russian unit right after it had relieved another, a new unit in place that didn't know what it was doing. Another example of that from WW2 is the fate of the 106th ID in the Ardenne, on \"the line\" for the first time for a whopping four days before being struck by an entire Panzer Corps. \n\nWhich brings us to another weak point, using intel to find weak units and attacking them. That's the reason that military intelligence works diligently to know their enemy, to know who they're fighting because it matters. In WW2, the Allies would obviously want to know if there was a W. SS division in front of them versus some hodgepodge collection of Volksgrenadiers or better yet, Volkssturm. In this war, the same would be like knowing if VDV, naval infantry, or better Wagner units are in front of a Ukrainian unit versus BARS motor rifle, Mobik units, or LDNR. That will matter greatly.",
