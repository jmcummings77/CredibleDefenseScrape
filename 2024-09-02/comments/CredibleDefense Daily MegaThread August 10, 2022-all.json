A framework like this already exists for emergency services in some jurisdictions. Allow for and investigate anonymous labor complaints, or shield labour complainant information from immigration authorities.\n\nAs long as there are illegal workers, there will be a power imbalance.  I don't think anonymity is that good of a fix because usually the specifics of the details will directly point back to the particular case.  E.g. you can't realistically anonymously open a grievance about unsafe work conditions causing a steel beam to fall on your toe when only one such freak accident has happened in the plant in the last months.\n\nOne way you could address this is to make it so that illegal employment carries heavy penalties for the employer, not for the employee, so illegal employees are not disincentivised from claiming their protections.  But even that does not change the fact that they do not have a right to work here, so they will get deported one way or another if someone finds out.\n\nThe only way to fix that is to either stop illegal immigration completely or give up the ability of the state to decide who is permitted to work and who isn't.  But that opens a huge other can of worms and is not really a possibility.\n\n> Essentially your argument boils down to \"Immigrants can't safely unionize, so they're a hindrance to unionization, so we should restrict their entry.\" Seems a lot simpler to make it safe for immigrants to unionize.\n\nI'm talking about illegal immigrants, not legal ones.  Make sure to keep the difference in mind.  I've already explained how the situation cannot really be improved much for illegal immigrants by construction.\n\nAnd even with legal immigrants, there is always a risk to unionisation that affects natives in just the same way (e.g. the employer shutting the business after successful unionisation or the employer just firing the employee despite that being illegal; your legal resources are limited if you cannot afford a lawyer and there is not enough evidence for an open and shut case).\n\nYou are also completely ignoring the point of people who don't care about having enough money for a sustainable life because they plan to go back to their homeland anyway.  So why take the risk of being out of your job and jeopardise your whole situation when you already make enough money for what you aim to achieve?  A native worker doesn't have this possibility.\n\nAs for legal immigration, a job market is subject to supply and demand.  Let's take for example nursing in Germany.  Wages haven't risen in years due to a lack of incentives to do so.  Strikes are not really possible because patients die when you don't tend to them.  Unions are more or less dependent on hospitals just agreeing to better bargaining agreements.  So many nurses moved to Scandinavia to work there instead, leading to a shortage.  This shortage now finally creates conditions in which pressure can be exerted on the employers to agree to better work conditions and higher wages, because they literally cannot find people willing to do the job otherwise.

                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The solution here is ensuring there are proper protections in place for anyone seeking to unionize, regardless of legal status. A framework like this already exists for emergency services in some jurisdictions. Allow for and investigate anonymous labor complaints, or shield labour complainant information from immigration authorities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As long as there are illegal workers, there will be a power imbalance.  I don&#39;t think anonymity is that good of a fix because usually the specifics of the details will directly point back to the particular case.  E.g. you can&#39;t realistically anonymously open a grievance about unsafe work conditions causing a steel beam to fall on your toe when only one such freak accident has happened in the plant in the last months.</p>\n\n<p>One way you could address this is to make it so that illegal employment carries heavy penalties for the employer, not for the employee, so illegal employees are not disincentivised from claiming their protections.  But even that does not change the fact that they do not have a right to work here, so they will get deported one way or another if someone finds out.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to fix that is to either stop illegal immigration completely or give up the ability of the state to decide who is permitted to work and who isn&#39;t.

                "body": "When you listen to people in Russia, there's mostly two things being discussed I hear. Direct anti-Ukrainian pro-war talk, and extremely vague 'hope things get better in Ukraine soon' talk. The second one is most common and is intentionally vague and open to interpretation. It doesn't acknowledge that Russia is the cause of issues there and externalizes the blame, implying that the situation is out of Russia's control. But it sounds broadly pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian so a *lot* of people say it.\n\nHowever, it's also kind of revealing as to the logic of average Russians with regards to politics. In Russian politics, you have no representation and nothing goes well. Politics are out of your control completely. Are they? Not really, but the Russian government finds that outlook useful. So the response to this is 'don't think about it, just worry about yourself', which is a predictable response.\n\nSo the reasoning is that 'this is happening in Ukraine, not in Russia, don't worry about it, stop talking about it.' But with this stuff happening, either Crimea isn't Russian, or this *is* affecting Russia. So it would really, really damage the idea of this war being a victory or a safe win in the passive acceptance of most Russians.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>When you listen to people in Russia, there&#39;s mostly two things being discussed I hear. Direct anti-Ukrainian pro-war talk, and extremely vague &#39;hope things get better in Ukraine soon&#39; talk. The second one is most common and is intentionally vague and open to interpretation. It doesn&#39;t acknowledge that Russia is the cause of issues there and externalizes the blame, implying that the situation is out of Russia&#39;s control. But it sounds broadly pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian so a <em>lot</em> of people say it.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&#39;s also kind of revealing as to the logic of average Russians with regards to politics. In Russian politics, you have no representation and nothing goes well. Politics are out of your control completely. Are they? Not really, but the Russian government finds that outlook useful. So the response to this is &#39;don&#39;t think about it, just worry about yourself&#39;, which is a predictable response.</p>\n\n<p>So the reasoning is that &#39;this is happening in Ukraine, not in Russia, don&#39;t worry about it, stop talking about it.&#39; But with this stuff happening, either Crimea isn&#39;t Russian, or this <em>is</em> affecting Russia. So it would really, really damage the idea of this war being a victory or a safe win in the passive acceptance of most Russians. Wouldn&#39;t make them suddenly be anti-war, but it would cause them to be thrown off until a new avoidant narrative can be found.</p>\n\n<p>Which, another thing.

        "body": "*Paul Rinn, Navy captain who saved a warship from sinking, dies at 75. Rinn was commander of the USS Samuel B. Roberts when it hit an Iranian mine in the Persian Gulf in 1988.*\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2022/08/10/paul-rinn-navy-obituary/\n\nPaul X. Rinn, a Vietnam War veteran and ship captain who in 1988 led a desperate effort to save a U.S. Navy vessel from sinking after it struck an Iranian mine, died Aug. 3. He was 75.\n\nHis inspirational leadership in the face of crisis made him an icon among fellow sailors long after his retirement at the rank of captain in 1997. He served 29 years in the Navy and settled in Fairfax Station, eventually turning full-time to lecturing on military leadership and shipboard operations at the service\u2019s professional schools and elsewhere.\n\nCapt. Rinn died unexpectedly while in Boston for a speaking engagement, his family said. A cause of death was not provided.\n\nAs skipper of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts, Capt. Rinn took his crew into the war-torn Persian Gulf where they joined other U.S. warships protecting Kuwaiti tankers that had been reflagged as American vessels during the Iran-Iraq War. Returning from a convoy on April 14, the frigate struck an Iranian contact mine, which blew a massive hole in the hull.\n\nThe explosion broke the Roberts\u2019s keel and knocked out its electrical power. The ship immediately began taking on water. But Capt. Rinn had prepared his crew for such an emergency, crew members recalled, and over four grueling hours they saved the vessel, which the Navy repaired and kept in service for another 27 years.\n\nThe fight to save Samuel B. Roberts remains a case study in combat preparedness and a model emulated by successive generations of commanding officers, said Bryan McGrath, a retired U.S. Navy destroyer captain and consultant.\n\n\u201cCaptain Rinn had enormous influence in the way that captains who commanded after him approached their job,\u201d Capt. McGrath said. \u201cWhat we all heard from our captains and what we all heard from the training pipeline was a similar story: We\u2019re going to practice this over and again, until it\u2019s perfect. And then we\u2019re going to practice it perfectly over and over again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told my crew maybe 500 times. That is the legacy of Paul Rinn and the lessons that came out of Samuel B. Roberts: They were ready. They had prepared. They had actually thought through things. And they performed when it was most important.\u201d\n\nBorn in the Bronx on Sept. 13, 1946, Paul Xavier Rinn was educated in Catholic schools and at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Commissioned as a naval officer in 1968, he was sent a few years later to advise Thai riverine units in southeast Asia.\n\nFirefights on the muddy Mekong River taught Capt. Rinn that he had to let go of the things he could do nothing about, and focus with all of his intensity on the things he could change, he told an interviewer many years later. Combat would push you past anything you could imagine, he said; for those who weren\u2019t already prepared, it was too late.\n\nSuccessful tours aboard surface warships led Capt. Rinn to his first command in 1984: the guided missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts, then under construction at Bath Iron Works. As the ship came together, the captain gathered his chief petty officers to set the tone for the crew. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any second-place awards in combat. I don\u2019t intend this ship to be a second-place ship. I want this ship to be the best ship there ever was,\u201d he recalled telling them. \u201cBut the key is that I want every sailor who ever served on the ship to think this the best thing he could ever possibly have done with his life for those three years.\u201d\n\nCapt. Rinn put the crew through months of intense training, and by the time the Roberts sailed on its maiden deployment, it had beaten out seven other frigates to win the squadron\u2019s Battle E award, which goes to the best overall ship.\n\nGordon Van Hook, a retired Navy captain who served as the Roberts\u2019s chief engineer, recalled that the crew responded to Capt. Rinn\u2019s energy and demanding standards.\n\n\u201cPaul had that sports mentality of: I want to be the very best. And the crew loved it; they ate that stuff up. And that\u2019s not always the case, you know. A lot of times if you have a really demanding captain, it can be difficult.\u201d\n\nA view of the USS Samuel B.

Rinn, a Vietnam War veteran and ship captain who in 1988 led a desperate effort to save a U.S. Navy vessel from sinking after it struck an Iranian mine, died Aug. 3. He was 75.</p>\n\n<p>His inspirational leadership in the face of crisis made him an icon among fellow sailors long after his retirement at the rank of captain in 1997. He served 29 years in the Navy and settled in Fairfax Station, eventually turning full-time to lecturing on military leadership and shipboard operations at the service\u2019s professional schools and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Capt. Rinn died unexpectedly while in Boston for a speaking engagement, his family said. A cause of death was not provided.</p>\n\n<p>As skipper of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts, Capt. Rinn took his crew into the war-torn Persian Gulf where they joined other U.S. warships protecting Kuwaiti tankers that had been reflagged as American vessels during the Iran-Iraq War. Returning from a convoy on April 14, the frigate struck an Iranian contact mine, which blew a massive hole in the hull.</p>\n\n<p>The explosion broke the Roberts\u2019s keel and knocked out its electrical power. The ship immediately began taking on water. But Capt. Rinn had prepared his crew for such an emergency, crew members recalled, and over four grueling hours they saved the vessel, which the Navy repaired and kept in service for another 27 years.</p>\n\n<p>The fight to save Samuel B. Roberts remains a case study in combat preparedness and a model emulated by successive generations of commanding officers, said Bryan McGrath, a retired U.S. Navy destroyer captain and consultant.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCaptain Rinn had enormous influence in the way that captains who commanded after him approached their job,\u201d Capt.

The distance from Port Kavkaz to Kerch is less than 10 miles and both have significant port and ferry infrastructure. Journeying by road from Krasnodar to Sevastopol is an 8 hour journey. Turning that into a 9 or 9.5 hour journey is not going to significantly lengthen supply lines.\n\nNow, only light equipment can use the ferry (that is just about everything you need for sustained operations if you're not moving large amounts of tanks/artillery) but heavier equipment would need to use military lift ships from Novorossiyisk to Sevastopol - this might be a delay of one day. A single day added to a huge relocation or redeployment is not particularly significant.\n\n>I can't imagine Russia being able to adequately supply its troops in this massive chunk of land (a lot of it with hostile locals) \n\nWhy not? Moving trucks onto Crimea will not be difficult, and Crimea is a lot of farmland so there's significant local food produce.\n\nLogistically removing the bridge is only a nuisance.",

The UAF let us know they have a million men under arms, and though about 400,000 of those are naval,Air Force,AA, border guards or NG, 600,000 are supposedly ground forces.  granted, a goodly portion of them are TDF scattered about, and all those guys getting the two week training appear slotted as replacements for the existing regular army formations, but my back of the envelope calculations are still missing a hundred thousand sets of boots.      Assuming half of those are in training for weapon systems, that still leaves 50000 men  in \u2018new unit\u2019 training, ten to twelve real brigades worth. \n     Your scoffs are audible, but I offer a few data points to add to the conversation. Just three weeks ago, 3 or 4 brand new brigades none of us had heard  of appeared in the Donbas so the more dog eared regular brigades could go to rebuild; UAF has been consistent for months in saying offensive action would start in August, after training has completed; There are still 3 or so regular army reserve brigades which, despite already being semi organized before the balloon went up that have yet to enter the chat: we haven\u2019t seen much or any of the M113s and most of the tanks supplied by Poland, ect. have yet to enter the chat; France has provided significant (their word) numbers of APCs we have yet to see and finally, we\u2019 ve had at least one appearance on this board from someone who\u2019s father is in one of these units training.  \n     10-15 still appears rather optimistic-many of the missing may be over staffing TDBs or be added logistics or other support, but based on missing and delivered APCs, 6-8 seems reasonable.                                               \n        2.I\u2019m still baffled regarding the absence of additional artillery assistance I whined about last week, and still think Ukraine needs a minimum of 200 more 155 tubes in theatre, but I have a few caveats this week. \n   First, the 152mm supply issues may have eased some. With the 155mms taking over high accuracy missions, and the dropping tempo of Active Russian assaults, the daily nut for 152mms May be down to only 2000-3000 shells a day. Also, new Manufacture Romanian shells have shown up in You Tube vids- between these, Bulgarian new made shells and several recent deliveries of purchased stock, Ukraine May be in rough equilibrium at this time regarding supply and demand. When operational tempo kicks up again it won\u2019t be, but for now, it shifts things a bit. \n    I also think the greater need has shifted in the short term to replacing maneuver/ direct fire capabilities for new units. 105mm teams continue to train in the UK,  and they may be slotted to replace the 122mm SPGs organic to Mech brigades for new brigades.                                                                                                                      \n         3 Mobile fire support seems lacking in general, without the 122mms. The motorized brigades don\u2019t appear to have any at all, being given a battalion of 100mm anti tank guns as a stopgap. This is concerning, as the M113s and French VABs only sport a heavy machine guns. \n     I don\u2019t see any clear path to solving this- The US has recently retired Stryker mounted 105s and  France is retiring its AMX 10s, but both have maintenance issues, and neither is available in quantities sufficient to meet needs. I would be very surprised if we saw either vehicle in Ukraine.\n      I suspect an effort is under way to solve the issue with 120mm mortars. The last aid draw down had 20 mortars, but 20k rounds- looks like a start to training and supply build up.  Mortars aren\u2019t direct fire, but they are up close and tactical. There are VAB and M113 carrier versions available in more than sufficient numbers, thousands of dismounted units for trenches and light infantry and for practical purposes, endless ammo available. They are also cheap, need littLe training and pack a pretty good punch.                                                              \n        4 The three RA mech and armor brigades pulled off the Donbas line last month are about ready to re-enter the chat. \n    From various vids, they didn\u2019t get any western APCs, their  losses being made good with BMPs (the post\u2019s I\u2019ve seen haven\u2019t stated weather these are coming from the repair depo, are rehabbed Russian captures or donations from NATO). I\u2019m glad they took the time to properly integrate replacements, though almost every casualty who didn\u2019t lose a limb seems to have returned to the units. The question is, do they slot back into the defensive line so other brigades can cycle out (The motorized infantry brigades like the one at Pinsky seem rode hard and put away wet) or do they form a mobile force bent on mischief?                                                                                                \n              5 So, lend lease.

I think they wouldn't have made the attack in the first place if they weren't ready to receive an ass pounding in exchange for it. UA didn't have good reason to assume they would be able to stand down and the Russians had no zero reason to assume it would be a one time thing either, using it as a poke you step away from right after doesn't make much sense, is incredibly risky and actually escalatory with no safeguards against any further escalatory Russian response along with the option to step down after the attack not being a guarentee either. \n\nThe fact that we haven't seen other attacks like it since then up until now only tells me that Ukraine simply didn't have a similar opportunity paired with the actual capability to capitalize on it until now, which wouldn't be surprising given how risky and lucky the Belgorod strike was and Crimea is much better protected than Belgorod. I don't know if it has been confirmed or debunked since the attack but the arrival ATACMS could be what enabled another, much safer strike which would make sense. \n\n>THAT'S LITERALLY WHY THIS SUB CAN'T SHUT UP DISCUSSING IT\n\nIt's expected in the sense that Russia knew since Belgorod that the possibility for strikes like this was on the table and if Ukraine both saw the opportunity and could go for it, they would do it again, I don't doubt that they've done much to prevent another Belgorod since then as well even if they failed right now. \n\nIf you give this sub a whole month of nothing it still would be constant chattering about slicing the salami and breaking Russia or the slowly crawling yet inevitable Russian victory, doesn't mean much.

I think they wouldn&#39;t have made the attack in the first place if they weren&#39;t ready to receive an ass pounding in exchange for it. UA didn&#39;t have good reason to assume they would be able to stand down and the Russians had no zero reason to assume it would be a one time thing either, using it as a poke you step away from right after doesn&#39;t make much sense, is incredibly risky and actually escalatory with no safeguards against any further escalatory Russian response along with the option to step down after the attack not being a guarentee either. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that we haven&#39;t seen other attacks like it since then up until now only tells me that Ukraine simply didn&#39;t have a similar opportunity paired with the actual capability to capitalize on it until now, which wouldn&#39;t be surprising given how risky and lucky the Belgorod strike was and Crimea is much better protected than Belgorod. I don&#39;t know if it has been confirmed or debunked since the attack but the arrival ATACMS could be what enabled another, much safer strike which would make sense. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>THAT&#39;S LITERALLY WHY THIS SUB CAN&#39;T SHUT UP DISCUSSING IT</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s expected in the sense that Russia knew since Belgorod that the possibility for strikes like this was on the table and if Ukraine both saw the opportunity and could go for it, they would do it again, I don&#39;t doubt that they&#39;ve done much to prevent another Belgorod since then as well even if they failed right now. </p>\n\n<p>If you give this sub a whole month of nothing it still would be constant chattering about slicing the salami and breaking Russia or the slowly crawling yet inevitable Russian victory, doesn&#39;t mean much. People will be talking about it here and elsewhere because it&#39;s a genuine win for Ukraine, and it&#39;s been shown that people will talk about even much more minor gains than this strike, what it isn&#39;t is something that&#39;s new.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Eh. \n\nFirst off, about the costs: those are some of the costs but the list is absolutely not exhaustive. The term \u201ecost of switching energy suppliers\u201c is quite vague and doesn\u2019t really capture exactly what\u2019s going on. It applies pretty well for gas where the main cost is building and using infrastructure to support imports from other suppliers, but as the market for LNG is globally integrated and global supply isn\u2019t ramping up  fast enough, a good chunk of the cost is also that you have to outbid the people who were previously buying the supply of LNG you\u2018re now acquiring - this is why global LNG prices are up a lot. Same reasoning also applies to oil, with the difference that Russia is able to re-route most of the oil deliveries previously intended for Europe to other buyers. Same reasoning also applies to a myriad of other commodities like food or raw materials. You\u2019re also forgetting that countries like Germany especially were previously exporting a ton of industrial and manufactured goods to Russia, like cars, airplanes, machine parts, etc etc, among other things. That export market is now gone for Europe. No, Poland\u2018s way of immediately switching to LNG 8 years ago is probably not cheaper than what eg Germany is doing (only switching now) because LNG is egregiously expensive compared to pipeline gas, so Poland endured much higher gas prices over the years. The real mistake Germany made was encouraging private consumers to heat their homes with gas - but that\u2019s beside the point. \n\nThe cost of supporting the refugees is probably rather negligible and mostly borne by Poland. Refugees have been given work permits, and most have returned to Ukraine now anyway. \n\nThe cost of rebuilding Ukraine is just not a factor. The west doesn\u2019t have to bear that cost if it doesn\u2019t want to; the cost will if at all only be realised after the war is over; and hopefully it will be done with frozen Russian assets, especially central bank assets. \n\nSo i think you\u2018re misjudging what is in the west\u2018s economic interest. If it was purely going off economic logic, Europe would want stability in Ukraine above all else, and a quick end to sanctions on Russia to bring down global energy and commodities costs. This would in effect mean quickly reaching a lasting settlement with Russia - any settlement in fact, provided it is lasting. Europe withdrawing support for Ukraine would actually shorten the war as Ukraine would pretty quickly be unable to pay for most essential imports, as a consequence the economy would grind to a halt, and eventually the government would find itself unable to pay and supply its frontline troops. All that is discounting the effect that the absence of western military support would have on Ukraine\u2018s military - eg no Himars to somewhat counter Russian artillery, no intelligence support, etc. \n\nThe outcome Russia has been banking on is that the west would force Ukraine to reach an unfavourable but stable settlement with Russia, and then lift sanctions in exchange for stability. And if Europe was only interested in its own economic wellbeing, this is the strategy it would pursue - but luckily that\u2019s not what is happening.",

Otherwise it looks like a regular T-80 on the back.They should have made it out T-80U instead, then it would have been a bit betterLook here, some ERA slots have never been filled with anything, only water from the outside&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

But as long as it hasn&#39;t fallen down completely you will always be able to find military drivers willing to drive across. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nuclear fallout doesn&#39;t <em>ask</em> whether you&#39;re military or civilian. You don&#39;t get to &quot;volunteer&quot; across it. If a bridge is damaged and you don&#39;t want to cross it if you&#39;re a civilian? No problem. Take the long way around. A soldier does? Cool. Radiation leaks don&#39;t work that way. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I know you&#39;re relatively knowledgeable, even if misguided, about specific terms of war. But, I do not think you&#39;re a physicist. Whether a &quot;localized&quot; event of radiation leak is restricted to 50 km<sup>2</sup> or 500 km<sup>2</sup> is not something you, much less a 22-year-old soldier, is going to be calculating on the spot either. These things have long-term irrevocable effects. And human folly is to think we know more, can control more, can manage more to factors that we often can&#39;t. That&#39;s hubris.</p>\n</div>",

The issue is that culture as an explanatory variable in international relations / military affairs is often just a gateway to chauvinism and stereotype. I'm not saying culture has no impact on international relations, but to view it as the sole explanatory variable in how we should approach the Russia / Ukraine war is simply nonsense (and indeed, the poster above has basically said we cannot understand the Russian mindset as our own because it's so deeply ingrained in violence). Hell, one might even look at the *numerous* American-led interventions the world over (from Afghanistan / Iraq and GWOT, to Vietnam, to Panama, and many many others) and say that \"Americans only understand force and violence in international affairs.\" We would (rightly) roll our eyes at such a statement. I suppose all I'm asking for is a little nuance more than \"Russians are brutes.\" \n\n>I can't imagine that there is anyone that has lived next to or among Russians that has not noticed the \"they respect strength and despise weakness\" trait. It is so deeply ingrained in many aspects of Russian culture that it is truly inescapable.\n\nThis is true but to be blunt, does this not apply to most slavic cultural groups? Anyone who has spent time in Poland or Ukraine or Russia will certainly note a more patriarchal, \"machismo\" social order that has more tolerance for violence and chauvinism than, say, an urban liberal socialite's circle in New York. I guess I just question how relevant this is to the current conflict and if we really should be using it to frame this war. \n\nAlso, frankly, what's there to engage with in the above post?",
