Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

They might even turn off street lights. What is surprising is that this would also apply in every small UA city, and that big cities still have some white spots so street lights are still on but only very partially and not at all in small cities.\n\nAlternative explanation is instantaneous exodus as ukraine dimmed in a few days (albeit there was some dimming pre war vs 2021.\n\nThis tool is still useful to some extent, especially to assess cities fully shuting down when the UA electricity grid will locally or globally collapse.\n\n[UKRAINE BEFORE AFTER](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=27.114618726714696,46.22665424393204,39.4638087732107,51.87865984463952&l=Reference_Labels_15m,Reference_Features_15m,Coastlines_15m(hidden),VIIRS_SNPP_DayNightBand_At_Sensor_Radiance,VIIRS_Black_Marble,VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden)&lg=false&l1=Reference_Labels_15m,Reference_Features_15m,Coastlines_15m(hidden),VIIRS_SNPP_DayNightBand_At_Sensor_Radiance,VIIRS_Black_Marble,VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden)&lg1=false&ca=true&cv=53&t=2021-02-20-T10%3A00%3A00Z&t1=2024-01-13-T00%3A00%3A00Z)\n\n[Slide from 0 to 100%](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?v=34.13558748382365,49.24663020311924,37.58837794785402,50.82691125534147&l=Reference_Labels_15m,Reference_Features_15m,Coastlines_15m(hidden),VIIRS_SNPP_DayNightBand_At_Sensor_Radiance,VIIRS_Black_Marble,VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden)&lg=false&l1=Reference_Labels_15m,Reference_Features_15m,Coastlines_15m(hidden),VIIRS_SNPP_DayNightBand_At_Sensor_Radiance,VIIRS_Black_Marble,VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden)&lg1=false&ca=true&cm=opacity&t=2021-02-20-T10%3A00%3A00Z&t1=2024-01-13-T00%3A00%3A00Z)\n\nSo there is this great NASA project called Black Marble that allows to have many kinds (quite a LOT) of satellite data, it is kind of the google earth of atypical satellite imagery.\n\nIt allows to assess UA electricity grid indirectly, via assessing the luminosity change in UA cities.\n\nI have looked at it and here are the following I can observe:\n\nThe only major city that has considerably reduced its night light emission is Kharkiv, Kharkiv is literally a dead city that emits less light than a **no man's land**.

Indeed Kharkiv has an homogeneous effect with not a single part of the city with white brightness pixels, compare that to my Kyiv comparison link.\n\nedit so I looked more at early days of the war (many are blurry sadly) and I observe the following things:\n\nUkraine has dimmed between 2021 and 2022 pre-war, maybe because of war rumor or of Ukraine decline but the level of dimming is mild in comparison to the post war.\n\nThe vast majority of dimming happen in the following *days* after the war.\n\nSadly no explanation seems to makes sense.\n\nOne would have to either believe that most of ukrainians that left the country, left it in a few days starting february 24 which seems very quick.\n\nOr that Ukraine voted (is there such a public law?) for a global nighttime curfew that they would have magically managed to implement simultaneously in every single city of ukraine, including the many small cities.\n\nEven if they did such a thing, this doesn't seem to make any sense, why would they do that?\n\nstreet lightning consume a negligible amount of electricity versus someone's fridge or washing machine.

The main feature of laser weapons is their low cost. It is stated that a shot costs 10 pounds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The British DragonFire is a <a href=\"https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-uk-demonstrates-rival-to-israels-iron-beam-1001468374\">rival</a> to Israel&#39;s Iron Beam, which has supposedly been <a href=\"https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/hywpcxufp\">deployed</a> in the war against Hamas. This is a great opportunity for the West to test and improve new laser weapons.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "The Patriot preformed pretty terribly in the Gulf War, with accounts being they didn't shot down *any* SCUDs. I think the 40% number you cite is rather optimistic, probably the truth is somewhere in between. But the result of that rather poor performance was that the upgrades to Pat in the following decades were pretty good, built off real world data they have. Patriot has proven itself since then in nearly every conflict its been in including GWOT. Who knows what the actual intercept rate is in Ukraine, but my guess is that its somewhere north of 3/4. Its probably the case that Ukraine has even downed hypersonic glide vehicles with Patriot, a capability it certainly wasn't designed for. \n\nGenerally these days conventional ABM is not that hard. Most missiles are large and fly slowly, most western AD (both naval and ground based) is layered such that there are multiple attempts to hit each weapon, and the result is that while no one system has a perfect kill probability the math is bad for the attacker (in the short term, there is also the cost to cost comparison). Ships operating in groups are particularly resilient to anything except massed ABM fire such that China or Russia may throw at them. \n\nBut there are less conventional complications which make cutting edge ABM intercept tougher. First hypersonics and stealth weapons reduce the chances for any one missile to hit its target AND reduce time from engagement to impact. Second, you have conventional ABM but also strategic/ICBM ABM and thats a whole separate game. If you can put something into orbit, intercept chances on the deorbit will go from on the order of 75-90% to 10-20%. There arnt enough anti-ICBM missiles in the west to stop a massed MIRV'd missile attack. Depending on how China wanted to play the game, this is a serious threat.\n\n*Edit:* Just for clarification, kill probability =/= % of missiles destroyed. So if the Patriot has an 80% intercept rate that does not mean that it shoots down 80% of attackers missiles. It means that out of every 5 shots 4 hit the target. This is important for two reasons. The higher above 50% you get, the closer to 90+% kill probability you'll have on ever *two* missiles fired, which is a useful marker for interception planning. On a system like Patriot its probably the case that a battery will shoot off all its missiles, or every missile planned, *before* a BM enters its terminal stage. So from a planning standpoint its good to know that if you shoot two missiles or three missiles at every threat, youre likely to get a hard kill. For the Navy and Standard Missile this is doubly important as that missile is IIRC smaller and shorter range, plus the margin there is so much narrower. Second, this also means that saturation attacks are not just very useful, but IMO become *more* useful as the pK goes up. If you cant count on slipping a cheeky missile in through a porous defense, you really have to go for the knock out by totally depleting stores. Even if the Patriot had a 100% pK, it only has four missiles per launcher. Fire off five weapons at it, and you are garunteed to beat **that layer** of ABM defense.

Much of that backing is a cold war remnant (when China had much more of an appetite for international interventionism of the Maoist stripe) - the UWSP was borne out of the Communist Party of Burma, has a state apparatus modeled much on China's, and has pretty much always strived to have warm relations. \n\nIt is important to remember that outside of Taiwan, a large chunk of KMT forces retreated across the border to Burma - [seizing much of the Shan state in the process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Burma1953.png). In the first half of the 1950s, these forces would launch periodic raids into neighboring Yunnan province in the dream of retaking China as a whole... which obviously incentivized the CCP to find counterweights in the region. Even after the explicit withdrawal of KMT forces in 1961, KMT Irregulars would remain in the region (many of which moved to Chiang Rai, where they would fight communists on behalf of the Thai government - as well as being *the* major player in the Golden Triangle Opium trade). Support for the Communist Party of Burma was, in many ways, a way for Beijing to combat these hostilities on their border (plus, after Ne Win's 1962 coup, Burma was no friend of the CCP). Wa people made up much of the rank-and-file fighting force of the Communist Party of Burma, until their split in 1989.\n\nAs for why China continues to support the UWSP? Personally, I believe much of it simply has to do with institutional momentum - the CCP foreign policy seems rather 'sticky', with very little appetite to throw previous allies under the bus. There is also a dimension where there can be a real material benefit to having a strong ally right across the border in what's an incredibly tumultuous border region.\n\nThere is very little evidence of any Chinese territorial ambitions outside of the claims articulated in the 1952 nine dashed line map.

Of course veteran authors like David Drake remind me that dangerous conflict situations are nothing like as predictable as Hollywood screenplays, and in particular that it is very difficult to exert fine control on the actions of people who feel that their lives are in danger.

Timelines are required but they need not act as anything more than a rough guide, necessary to coordinate adjacent units, logistics, fires, etc. But often in modern military history, timelines are carved in stone and adhered to by subordinate commanders, and are used by senior commanders to judge subordinate performance. If the subordinate units succeed in their mission within the timeline while taking acceptable losses, the subordinate commanders gets medals and promotions, as so the senior command and staff who planned and executed it. If subordinate units fail to take their objective at all, within the timeline, or taking unacceptable losses, they are threatened with relief (being fired for cause) and/or poor performance reviews (leading to fewer future promotions). \n\nEveryone reading this post needs to realize that officers above the rank of captain are nearly all professionals. That doesn't mean competent, it means THAT IS THEIR CAREER. They intend to serve in the military as an officer to make a living. Some are more ambitious and competent than others, a mix of those lead to more promotions, which means more pay, prestige, power and other benefits. Failing at anything leaves a black mark in a professional officer's career, they must prevent it. As senior commanders, they must plan and execute successful operations. As subordinate commanders, they must execute them as ordered.\n\nHistorically, one of the biggest causes of casualties in warfare comes from pressure exerted on subordinate commanders by senior to make progress, especially to follow timelines. Senior officers become embarrassed that the plan they brief to the top brass isn't working, so it's time to start threatening subordinate commanders to get progress. Instead of admitting the plan sucks or isn't realistic, they \"fight the plan and not the enemy,\" trying to make the plan work to appease their bosses. And the losses ALWAYS stack up when what happens. It's why flexibility is considered a good thing in warfare.\n\nThis is where the Russian military culture comes into play. IT'S RIGID. Flexibility was deliberately removed especially from the battalion level and under, where those tactical echelons exist to strictly follow orders given to them, which are often unrealistic. Incredible pressure from senior commanders during offensives is a centuries old tradition, especially within living history, it's how they operate. The boss is ALWAYS right.

Shit rolls downhill, and that leads to crazy high levels of pressure, as well as accepting of very heavy losses to get the job done, as well as accepting much higher than necessary levels of risk for the long shot that they will succeed. \n\nThat said, considering the major systemic problems the UAF have at the moment, significant staffing issues, lack of reserves, lack of artillery and air defense ammo, and forced to fight forward \"at all cost\" from insufficient defensive positions, Russia can likely get away with risky behavior because they're still causing a level of attrition the UAF can't sustain in the near term, as well as now regularly advancing thanks to the weakened UAF and some better TTP learned the hard way after two years of blood.",

They took a lot of losses repelling the UAF summer-fall offensive, then had a significant amount of their force structure on the offensive since October, so 7 months now. They've consumed quite a lot of manpower, material, and supplies. They'll definitely not be able to sustain this rate forever. \n\nThat said, if I were in their position I'd definitely be on the broad front offensive too. I think they're doing it needlessly recklessly, their emphasis should be on firepower and clever tactics to use the UAF strategic guidance for an aggressive forward defense against them but even doing it the way they're doing it they very well could crack the UAF strategic defensive abilities where they can't stop the Russians, then that can force an end to this war this year and on Putin's terms. \n\nI don't think the Russians are at a place where they're doing irreparable long term damage to their military like they were in spring-summer 2022, when they were fighting very stupidly, using very bad tactics to support a bad strategy, under strength to the point is was ridiculous they were still on the offensive, while glaringly not politically, economically, societally, and industrially committed to the war. That's changed. They're not in great shape now but I think it's enough to wrap this thing up in a year or so. \n\nif they can't break the UAF by even early summer they'll probably gas out at the strategic level, be forced to limit offensive actions to only a few select sector if that for some months to rebuild. But they have the systems in place now to make good most of their losses in everything minus AFV, which I'm not going to rule out can't be resupplied with foreign allied assistance since they did come through already for ammo. And whatever losses they take, there are big indications the UAF definitely can't sustain this pace now, let alone in the future.",

I think they&#39;re doing it needlessly recklessly, their emphasis should be on firepower and clever tactics to use the UAF strategic guidance for an aggressive forward defense against them but even doing it the way they&#39;re doing it they very well could crack the UAF strategic defensive abilities where they can&#39;t stop the Russians, then that can force an end to this war this year and on Putin&#39;s terms. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think the Russians are at a place where they&#39;re doing irreparable long term damage to their military like they were in spring-summer 2022, when they were fighting very stupidly, using very bad tactics to support a bad strategy, under strength to the point is was ridiculous they were still on the offensive, while glaringly not politically, economically, societally, and industrially committed to the war. That&#39;s changed. They&#39;re not in great shape now but I think it&#39;s enough to wrap this thing up in a year or so. </p>\n\n<p>if they can&#39;t break the UAF by even early summer they&#39;ll probably gas out at the strategic level, be forced to limit offensive actions to only a few select sector if that for some months to rebuild. But they have the systems in place now to make good most of their losses in everything minus AFV, which I&#39;m not going to rule out can&#39;t be resupplied with foreign allied assistance since they did come through already for ammo. And whatever losses they take, there are big indications the UAF definitely can&#39;t sustain this pace now, let alone in the future.</p>\n</div>",

In the early days of this war money didn't matter as much because you could just send some old material you weren't using anymore but nowadays these reserves have mostly run out and money is needed to fund new production. The example of the UK shows the issue quite nicely. The UK is often seen as one of Ukraine's strongest supporters. They plan to support Ukraine in 2024 with roughly \u20ac2.5 billion. For a roughly \u20ac2.5 trillion economy that's 0.1% of their GDP, a small amount especially in the context of what is likely needed for Ukraine to win. If the whole of Europe matched the UK's effort, we would get to roughly \u20ac20 billion a year. I fear that's way too little for Ukraine. In this case, clearly our actions don't match our words. \n\n- The re-arming of Europe is very real, you could argue that it's still not enough but the growth in recent years is very significant. And with everything that is happening in the world, I am confident this won't be reversed in the coming years. It's good to see that spending is especially growing in places where it is most needed: those countries bordering Russia or close to it. Also, when it comes to spending we are often very fixated on whether a country did or didn't meet the 2% target but we should remember that even a Germany that spends 1.8% on defense is still spending 50% more than they did for most of the 21st century. That's a big deal. \n\n- I don't think trading with Russia is that important. A lot of the trading with Russia consisted of us buying Russian oil and gas. Those flows stopping was a huge deal for a while but prices have normalized at this point. In a world where wind and solar are continuously getting cheaper and better and where the dangers of climate change are recognized more and more, politicians won't be itching to return to the old days of dependency on Russia. \n\n- Not all far right populists are pro Russian, some are but a lot of them will drop Russia the moment it is politically convenient.",

Additionally, the companies that own the refineries continue to pay an oil extraction tax despite the attacks. \u201cSome people think that by attacking oil refineries, the related export revenue disappears, but that is not true. It just turns into revenue from crude oil export,\u201d Vakulenko told The Moscow Times. \n\n- Despite the minimal impact on energy revenues, Ukrainian drones are inflicting serious damage to Russia\u2019s infrastructure. \n\n- Experts agreed that the long-term outcome of these attacks on the Russian economy will ultimately depend on Ukraine\u2019s capacity to maintain the intensity of these attacks versus Russia\u2019s ability to repair the refineries quickly.",
