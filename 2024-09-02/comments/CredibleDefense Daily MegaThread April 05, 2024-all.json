It can operate autonomously, semi-autonomously or in manual flight modes. With a flight endurance of up to 60 minutes and a range of 10 km with communication (or up to 30 km in autopilot mode), the drone maintains a speed of 12-15 m/s.*\n\n*Currently deployed as part of the Army of Drones project, the WarDog drones are actively engaged in operational tasks in Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions. Recent tests near Kramatorsk showcased the drone\u2019s capabilities in GPS-suppressed environments, operating successfully at altitudes exceeding 50 m.*\n\n*One key advantage highlighted by military personnel is the drone\u2019s stability in flight even without GPS signals. This stability enables clear imagery and enhanced focus, especially in windy conditions. In response to this feedback, developers have further refined the UAV\u2019s features, enhancing its role as a precise artillery\u2019s eyes on the battlefield.*\n\n[\u200bThe Ultimate Advantage of Ukrainian Long-Range Kamikaze Drones Revealed: New-Gen DSMAC Guidance Like in Cruise Missiles | Defense Express | April 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/the_ultimate_advantage_of_ukrainian_long_range_kamikaze_drones_revealed_new_gen_dsmac_guidance_like_in_cruise_missiles-10051.html)\n\n*This technology ignores enemy EW suppression, ensures proper navigation and enhances precision of strikes. It's also used in Tomahawk and Storm Shadow missiles but Ukrainian developers went further and created its new generation*\n\n*Speaking of long-range drone strikes on targets in russia located over 1,200 km from the launch point, navigation is the key factor in success. That's because the drone has to not just reach the target but make it via a complex route that seeks to bypass enemy's air defense-protected areas.*\n\n*Surely, that could be achieved by utilizing satellite navigation methods but those are vulnerable to electronic warfare systems, and knowing that, Russia invested lots of money into expanding and improving its EW network. Moreover, even before the outbreak of the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow was working on creating whole \"EW fields\" that would suppress satellite navigation over entire regions of Russia.*\n\n*That's not to mention Tobol stationary systems, one of them fielded in the Kaliningrad region and creating constant problems with GPS in Europe. Similar level of power was declared also for the Murmansk-BN system, in the photo above.*\n\n*That is why relying solely on satellite navigation is too ineffective. Therefore, as CNN learned from its sources, Ukrainian long-range drones employ a guidance system described as \"basic form of artificial intelligence,\" and it helps the aerial vehicles to figure out their current location based on surroundings.*\n\n*On the part of Defense Express, basically, it's an iteration of a well-known DSMAC (Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation) system but enhanced with modern technologies. The original DSMAC was introduced in the Tomahawk missile, the working principle is based on a pre-loaded reference image of the terrain that is tied to its real coordinates. During the flight, the cruise missile continuously takes photos of the terrain and compares them to the reference.*\n\n*However, it was developed in the 1980\u20131990s, when the computing capacity and storage memory were limited. Nowadays, however, hardware allows to pre-load the entire route into the missile, not just the key points of it and easily distinguishable areas, like crossroads. Furthermore, advanced algorithms for object recognition can enable the missile to fully navigate by landmarks.*\n\n*From that we can pretty much figure out how the drone's targeting during the final \u2014 terminal \u2014 phase of flight. The same principle allows the guidance system to recognize the intended target by comparing its image to the reference picture or model. The same kind of technology is used in the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile. It also explains how, for example, Liutyi drones eliminate relatively small objects like smoke stacks at oil refineries with such precision.*\n\n*Thus, the navigation system used in Ukrainian long-range drones is not just a copy of DSMAC, but in fact its new, more advanced version with much broader capabilities. At the same time, this guidance method has drawbacks which Defense Express analyzed in one of our [previous articles](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/kh_101_missiles_are_less_effective_at_night_but_russians_keep_shooting_in_the_dark-6000.html).*",

In that case, might as well keep the existing missile-trucks around, with the F-35 acting more as an escort fighter/mini AWACS. </p>\n\n<p>For the Royal Navy, the F-35 is a significant upgrade compared to the Harrier (or legacy hornet), which is also the reason the US Marines are pushing ahead with the F-35. But the capability difference between a later block super hornet and F-35 isn&#39;t as large, so its easier to say &quot;good enough&quot;.  </p>\n\n<p>The lower range of the SH is somewhat offset by the longer range munitions, and both the F-35 and F-18E can carry the same weapons loads.

You also have the cost issue, the Super Hornet is cheaper to both procure and operate. The Navy is already struggling with balancing its budget, and it has a lot more things to buy than just jets. Furthermore, because current platforms are increasingly unsuited for the Pacific theatre, the Navy will have to keep investing in the F/A-XX platform, whether they buy F-35Cs or not. This is speculation, but the Navy might not be that happy with the jet itself either. While you're right that it has a longer combat range, it carries significantly less ordinance, which matters more when you have a limited number of jets per boat, and it is not as versatile (it doesn't do the tanker role, for example).

In terms of money, the strengthening of the Navy is the largest investment in this long-term plan.\n\n>**More and improved air defence:**\u00a0The Government will purchase long-range air defence systems to protect against short-range ballistic missiles. In addition, the quantity of the existing NASAMS air defence will be doubled, which will be upgraded to improve protection against drones and missiles. Both the Air Force and the Army will receive more systems, and the current air defence systems will be updated.\n\n>**Stronger Army and Home Guard:**\u00a0The Army is being developed from one to three brigades, one in the northernmost county Finnmark, one in Troms, and a new Brigade South. Investments will follow on long-range precision firepower, additional combat vehicles, air defence, and helicopters for the Army and special forces. The Home Guard will increase to a total of 45,000 soldiers and with improved capabilities.\n\n>**Improve situational awareness:**\u00a0Increase the ability to create situational awareness with more surveillance, presence, and control in our surrounding areas, through the use of new vessels and the expansion of satellite and drone capabilities.\n\nAccording to the plan, Norway will work closer with other NATO countries in the Nordic region:\n\n>\u201975 years in the world\u2019s strongest military and political alliance has secured the peace and provided Norway\u2019s security guarantee.

We will also strengthen the land force by expanding the Army from one to three brigades and increasing the Home Guard to a total of 45,000 soldiers, says St\u00f8re.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

He expected the two countries to conclude the RAA shortly after the trilateral summit, which will be held on April 12 in Washington.\n\n>When Kishida visited the Philippines in November the two countries agreed to launch talks for the defence pact, while Japan agreed to provide the Philippine navy with coastal surveillance radars.\n\n>Dispatching the SDF to the region would be highly controversial in Japan and would be likely to trigger opposition from Komeito, a coalition partner of the ruling Liberal Democratic party.\n\n>People close to the Japanese government said a more likely scenario would be for the SDF to be temporarily stationed in the Philippines to take part in joint patrols and drills with the US, instead of Japan maintaining its troops on a rotational basis.\n\n\n>Deployment of Japanese troops in south-east Asia would mark a major development for Tokyo and Manila, which have significantly strengthened co-operation with the US to counter China.\n\n>Christopher Johnstone, a Japan expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank, said: \u201cIf it comes to fruition, a presence of Japanese forces in the Philippines would send two powerful messages to China: that a regional, multilateral security architecture is forming in response to Beijing\u2019s revisionist behaviour; and that Japan has become an accepted security provider in south-east Asia.

Using total trade is a poor lens to understand the importance of those shipping lanes in this case \n\nAlso, brief research shows that getting large tankers to, for example, Japan without going through there is not a small detour.  It's manageable, and possible, but also raises the costs of shipping by a significant amount.  You can't just look at a map and decide it's safe for a massive transport/tanker ship.

Their constellation is a very conscious design choice to prioritize latency/recency over resolution. There's no way to dodge the fundamental physical requirements of aperture size for optical systems, so to get higher resolution you must use a much, much, larger satellite.

We know there are multiple domestic and foreign drone manufacturing plans.  The source is claiming 10 separate manufacturers all with 2000km range.  \n\nIt's always exciting when we get to see a new drone in action or capabilities confirmed for the drones we already know about.  Could be an interesting summer when it comes to long range strike drones.  \n\n[Ukraine\u2019s New Long-Range Drones Could Be a Problem for Both NATO & Russia | Kyiv Post | April 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/30642)\n\n*A source \u201cfamiliar with the situation\u201d told Bild that recent drone strikes by Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces on Tatarstan, was just the beginning.*\n\n*Ukraine's Military Intelligence Directorate (HUR) confirmed on Tuesday, April 2 that Ukraine had targeted a drone assembly facility in Yelabuga and an oil refinery in Nizhnekamsk, both in Tatarstan, more than 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) from Ukraine. The weapons used are said to have been a modified UJ-22 drone fitted with additional fuel tanks to extend its normal 800-kilometer range and a Ukrainian ultra-light aircraft Aeroprakt A-22 \u201cFlying Fox,\u201d filled with explosives and adapted to act as a drone.*\n\n*According to Bild\u2019s source the AFU will take delivery of drones from 10 separate manufacturers with ranges of 2,000 km and more. It is hoped that these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) will make up for the limited numbers of long-range missiles in Kyiv\u2019s armory.*\n\n*\u201cRockets are a thing of the past. Drones are the future,\u201d the source said. He said that the Luch design bureau has developed the Sokol-3000 UAV, which can fly over 3,000 kilometers. Such a weapon would allow Ukraine to hit targets in the Murmansk region where there are more than 80 military bases, one of which the Olenya airfield is home to the strategic bombers that have launched hundreds of missiles against Ukraine.*\n\n*These capabilities will be good news for Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself and take the fight ever deeper into the Russian mainland while presenting Russia with a whole new range of military, political and social problems to deal with. According to Tatar political commentators Tuesday\u2019s strike the population \u201cis scared and shocked by the fact that\u2026 the war came to them, [so far] from the front line.\u201d One can only imagine it would be an even greater trauma in Murmansk.*\n\n*It will not only be the Kremlin that will find this a test. NATO\u2019s allies are already split on Ukraine\u2019s current limited ability to hit targets in Russia. Partners such as those in the Baltic nations, the UK, Finland, and France believe that strikes on oil refineries and military targets inside Russia are legally justifiable and that Ukraine should be able to defend itself in any way it chooses.*\n\n*Finland\u2019s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen is quoted by the Moscow Times as saying, in answer to a question about the Tatarstan attacks, at the NATO foreign ministers meeting on Thursday: \u201cThe UN Charter allows a country, while defending its independence, to attack military targets. So, I would just leave it like that.\u201d*\n\n*Other nations are concerned that attacks on Russia risk further escalation of the war and that attacks against the oil industry could destabilize the global energy market. This fear is one of the main drivers for the reluctance of Germany to provide Taurus cruise missiles and the US (up until now) to provide ATACMS missiles, both of which only have a 300-kilometer range.*\n\n*At a recent press conference in Paris, France US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said that Washington \u201chas neither supported nor enabled\u201d strikes by Ukraine outside its internationally recognized borders.*\n\n*Alongside him French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejournet said that as far as France was concerned Kyiv was acting \u201cwithin the framework of legitimate defense.\u201d*",

        "body": "Just finished reading the new book, \u201cNuclear War: A Scenario\u201d. Not very good, in my opinion! (I consider this on topic because it\u2019s a book about nuclear war, nuclear policy, etc: it\u2019s also highly newsworthy, as it\u2019s new, and it\u2019s just been announced it has been optioned for a movie. It\u2019s also a book that markets itself on the quality of research done: this is not \u201chere\u2019s a random novel I found about WW3\u201d, this is supposed to be a pretty definitively accurate book)\n\nThe technical details are fine, I have no reason to quibble them. For example, the segment on the effects of a megaton nuke hitting DC: it\u2019s well written, the details all look correct, it\u2019s very good. The author has a good way with writing this stuff so it keeps you engaged. There are some errors that jump out: Fractional Orbital Bombardment System is described as a system solely to put nukes in space to trigger EMPs, for example. But mostly I have no issues with the technical aspect\n\nI\u2019ve seen criticisms of the description of the US process for responding, insofar as the book states didactically that launch on warning *is* the undisputed policy: according to some, this is not the case, I\u2019m not qualified to say on that.\n\nBut the overall scenario is\u2026 ridiculous beyond measure. In summary of it:\n\nKim Jong Un decides to launch a first strike on the US (the book does not give any indication whatsoever of why and actively refuses to, simply saying \u201cwell he\u2019s mad so that\u2019s why\u201d). He orders one of the DPRK\u2019s submarines to a position off the coast of California, an operation the book acknowledges would take several months to complete. During the intervening months, there is literally 0 rise in tensions: no preparations for war, no sabre rattling, just months of absolute silence despite Kim deciding to try destroy the US.\n\nSaid submarine arrives undetected. Once there, several months after Kim has decided to destroy the US, he launches a single Hwasong-17 with a 1 megaton warhead at the Pentagon. US responds, GMD intercept fails, then the sub launches an SLBM at Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. US launches a joint Trident/Minuteman attack on DPRK. SLBM hits first, then the ICBM (indirectly killing the president as he attempts to evacuate, and blinding the secretary of defence who is sworn in as president), then the DPRK launches another ICBM that later breaks up on reentry. \n\nRussia, whose generals have been refusing to pick up the phone (China has picked up the phone from the Americans the full time), sees the two strikes on America, sees the Minuteman launch, and decides they are under attack, launches full all out strike against the US and NATO in general. The DPRK is hit by the Trident attack, and then begins shelling Seoul with chemical weapons, before detonating a \u201csuper EMP\u201d on a satellite above the US. US responds to the all out strike by launching an all out strike on Russia. WW3.\n\n10 year nuclear winter ensues, with the author patently refusing to engage with any of the criticism the concept has received (the only criticism acknowledged is the claims made in the 1980s that it was communist propaganda) and instead claims that models have *only* shown it will be more severe than initially claimed. It even has the gall to run the quote that \u201cof course there are uncertainties with nuclear winter scenarios\u2026 but there's no uncertainty if you inject that much soot into the atmosphere after a [full-scale] nuclear war\u201d, which is a statement that only really works if you have absolutely no idea about any of the debate about nuclear winter.\n\n---\n\nIt\u2019s an annoying book for a bunch of reasons. 1: I think you can get to the \u201csmall nuclear war triggers global nuclear war\u201d thing without having a completely absurd DPRK attack plan (I\u2019m not even opposed to them running a surprise DPRK attack scenario, but this is one that the book acknowledges would take months to prepare). \n\n2: it\u2019s abundantly clear that the author wants specific things, and so bends the story to happen a certain way. For example, a guy films the mushroom cloud over the nuclear power plant and posts it to his Facebook account. Within 2 minutes, this footage is so viral that twitter crashes because everyone is logging on to look at it. I can full well believe that footage of a real nuclear attack would go hyperviral, and that a nuclear war would probably take down a bunch of platforms due to surges in traffic and the effects of data centres going off. But 2 minutes from \u201cguy starts recording to facebook\u201d to \u201calmost everyone in the world has seen this\u201d is *silly*. To be honest, the more appropriate thing would be if the footage of the attack went largely missed because who's looking at that guy's facebook page at that moment? Also, a news anchor picks up their phone and shows it to the camera to show the audience that FEMA just sent an emergency text about nuclear war happening. It's therefore abundantly clear the author seeks certain *imagery*, vivid moments to tell you about, and so you get this sort of stuff of the world finding out about nuclear war through social media and CNN anchors pressing their phone up against a camera.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say \u201cthe book is bad because of this stuff about phones!\" it\u2019s to say that this stuff is *emblematic* of the wider problems with the scenario being laid out. Vivid imagery like secret service parachuting out of marine one with the president taking absolute precedence over plausibility, and then the book trying to say that it is being really realistic. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the rest of the book wasn\u2019t carrying stuff like this.\n\n3: as someone who thinks nuclear war is Bad and should be avoided at all costs (though I think unilateral disarmament is not plausible or even necessarily desirable), I find the absolute worst case alarmism underpinning it all to be very tiresome. Frankly, I would like the book more if instead of having Russia join in and trigger WW3, the book instead was just about a limited DPRK attack and a US counterstrike, with the message being \u201chey look how awful this is: now imagine it was an all out war\u201d. After all, if you delete the Russian stuff, you get a scenario where Washington DC is destroyed, the President is dead, the new President is a suddenly blind SecDef, and much of California is in the path of highly radioactive fallout from a destroyed nuclear reactor. Plenty nasty enough! Or, if you\u2019re going to do a WW3 spiralling from limited back and forth: go with a Russian tactical nuke receiving a NATO response and thus an escalation cycle, since the book is very concerned with the process of escalation.\n\n4: the nuclear winter bit is not the only time where the author takes uncritically the word of a single or group of subject-matter-expert while not criticising or getting alternate opinions. For example, early in the book it describes how Ted Postol proposed permanently stationing MQ-9 Reapers over the Sea of Japan to intercept DPRK launches. Postol apparently even proposed doing this joint with Russia\u2026 somehow. This proposal is left completely uncriticised and it is treated as a case of Cassandra being ignored despite their warnings. Postol similarly is used as a source for the idea that you could get a DPRK diesel electric sub 300 miles off California with no one noticing. \n\nNow I\u2019m not a subject matter expert, I\u2019m highly aware of that. But it seems odd to so confidently return to the same wells without having much in the way of counter-arguments. It\u2019s the same as with nuclear winter: it\u2019s fair enough to put this stuff in your work, but you should really give this stuff the appropriate marker of \u201cthis is what one expert believed, others differ\u201d, especially if you\u2019re marketing your book as \u201cbased on facts sourced from exclusive interviews\u201d and depicting a scenario that \u201ccould happen later today\u201d.\n\n---\n\nAnyone else read the book? Anyone share any particular thoughts on it, or feel differently? Like I said at the beginning, I just finished it and found myself rather confused as to a lot of the hype I\u2019d seen it getting.\n\nAlso, fun note: I finished the book, and tried to remember where I recognised the author from. I realised she was the person who wrote that *god awful* Area 51 book, the one that said very authoritatively that Roswell was the result of a plot by Stalin to spark alien invasion panic in the US by having Josef Mengele modify children to look alien, then stuffing them into a Ho 229 and flying them to the US where they would land and cause mass hysteria. And if that doesn\u2019t fill you with confidence\u2026",

Like I said at the beginning, I just finished it and found myself rather confused as to a lot of the hype I\u2019d seen it getting.</p>\n\n<p>Also, fun note: I finished the book, and tried to remember where I recognised the author from. I realised she was the person who wrote that <em>god awful</em> Area 51 book, the one that said very authoritatively that Roswell was the result of a plot by Stalin to spark alien invasion panic in the US by having Josef Mengele modify children to look alien, then stuffing them into a Ho 229 and flying them to the US where they would land and cause mass hysteria. And if that doesn\u2019t fill you with confidence\u2026</p>\n</div>",

Especially when foreign troops (under both conventional and UN peacekeeping auspices) already have such a mixed track record in the country.\n3. **What chance does it have of succeeding?** This is perhaps the most important concern that countries considering sending troops might have. Others have mentioned state-building, nation-building, and that's an interesting discussion. But set that aside for a minute and ask - what about basic security and order on the streets? Is that attainable? How hard would it be to attain for an uncoordinated multinational force who's hearts aren't really in it when facing gangs that are increasingly well armed with smuggled American (civilian) small arms? Because I think most of them are thinking that even that most basic goal (restoring order) is a pretty ambitious goal.\n4. **How long will it all take?** This one is very wrapped up in factors 1 and 3.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>There are no natural resources to exploit and Haiti only has underdeveloped human capital so..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is both reductive and unsupported by the facts on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>The truth of the matter is the reluctance to intervene is about self-interest, but it&#39;s focused on much more immediate factors, like:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>Who&#39;s going to pay for this operation?</strong> Always relevant, even if it will likely be the US and Europe.</li>\n<li><strong>Is it worth accepting the myriad of reputational risks and risks to the lives of their troops?</strong> Because as much as commentators are lamenting the lack of action by the international community right now, you can bet that whoever took on the responsibility of securing order and public safety in Haiti would be widely condemned (&quot;imperialist! colonizer!&quot; etc.) for doing so. Especially when foreign troops (under both conventional and UN peacekeeping auspices) already have such a mixed track record in the country.</li>\n<li><strong>What chance does it have of succeeding?</strong> This is perhaps the most important concern that countries considering sending troops might have. Others have mentioned state-building, nation-building, and that&#39;s an interesting discussion. But set that aside for a minute and ask - what about basic security and order on the streets? Is that attainable? How hard would it be to attain for an uncoordinated multinational force who&#39;s hearts aren&#39;t really in it when facing gangs that are increasingly well armed with smuggled American (civilian) small arms? Because I think most of them are thinking that even that most basic goal (restoring order) is a pretty ambitious goal.</li>\n<li><strong>How long will it all take?</strong> This one is very wrapped up in factors 1 and 3. There have been numerous interventions before. They went on for years. They saw some successes, and many failures and scandals as well.

Please tell me if you disagree or see something wrong with my conclusions or their justifications. \n\nThese conclusions are :\n\n1. FPV $100 drones are a pandoras box that shouldn't have been opened and in the future (after CUAS systems are built) will mostly be limited to irregular forces.\n2. Further to the previous point, CUAS systems are needed yesterday.\n3. The ideal drone force will be a mix of $50k harpy/lancet esq loitering munitions and similarly priced sensor drones that all have IFF codes so they don't get caught in CUAS fires.\n4. Armies in the future will need to get drone superiority in the same way they generally need air superiority to win an offensive operation. Although they will be able to win offensive ops without drone superiority, it would be a slog.\n\nJustifications for each : \n\n1. FPV drones are a pandoras box that shouldn't have been opened as using them means you can't use your CUAS systems. These hyper cheap drones that you can have hundreds of thousands of will not have IFF codes and will MASSIVELY limit what your CUAS can do. What this means is that if you have FPV drones, by definition you will also allow OPFOR to have FPV drones. The ideal system is to have a very expansive CUAS system with radars fires EW etc that can take down FPV drones but will avoid shooting down your 50k drones with IFF codes. Irregular forces who won't possess lancet type drones will likely use FPVs for harassment in places and times CUAS systems are inactive.\n2. CUAS systems are needed and need to be multi tiered and layered. They need to deal with everything from FPV drones to Harpy's to MQ reapers. Different systems for different threat levels.\n3. The ideal drones are 50k and they should make up the bulk of your force as these are expensive enough not suffer fratricide by CUAS but cheap enough to mass produce. Exquisite drones like reapers have a place but due to their price they will be a smaller component of the drone force.\n4. Drones are extremely useful. If OPFOR has drone superiority this means they can use drone sensors to cue a guided MLRS system/ lancet type loitering munition. Having a drone stalemate with slowdown how quickly you can neutralise OPFOR. \n\nPease tell me if you have any disagreements with this drone framework I have laid out.",

Well, it's limited in the US context because US procurement is *special*. Everyone loves to have very expensive gears with lots of capabilities but because they are so expensive, they aren't expendable. For example, the B-21 is a stealth, optionally-manned, and long range, nuclear capable bomber. They'll throw a standoff weapon on it just to be sure. Optionally manned? A missile is an unmanned flying object. A reusable bomber is very useful in conflicts you expect to not be world-ending but if its job it's to huck nuclear weapons, missiles are cheaper. \n\nAnother example is the USMC's landing craft. The previous Commandant wanted to turn the USMC into an A2/AD missile chucking force landing on random and small islands and atolls and fire missiles from there. They need a lot of landing ships carrying company-sized units to saturate the Pacific and they need them quick. They even dismiss the tanks and artillery. The Navy started working on the concept, adding more and more features to.make them more survivable. The features make the thing more expensive, so the need to make the ship bigger and carry more people to make it worthwhile. So instead of the USMC having 50, they will get 4. Meanwhile, the Marines don't have the ships to train and practice with. The Corp has already disbanded the enablers that made them work previously. And the Commandant initiating the 2030 redesign term is up without getting his landing ships.\n\nSecond, leg infatry doesn't have IFF codes at anything less than rock-throwing distance in the mordern war. Why isn't that a problem? Because people know how to use deconfliction, coordinating instructions, unit boundaries, and limits of fire. I tried participating in some rudimentary map exercises and immediately, it became obvious what are the first concerns: \"this is your left and right limits of advance, here's your left and right limits of fire, don't go beyond this phase line before tellling everyone and get an acknowledgment\". Does it slow things down? Yes. Does it prevent you being fired upon by your colleagues? Yes.\n\nThird, air defence has deconfliction like that, too. Something like: \"friendly aircraft will use this corridor in this time window, when you detect a target in this deconflicted time and space, don't automatically open fire on every airborne target in the deconflicted window and zone. Use IFF confirmation before firing\"\n\n>CUAS systems are needed and need to be multi tiered and layered.\n\nIntergrated Air Defence System (IADS). old story. Western forces neglected to have them, but it's not an impossible concept.",

A reusable bomber is very useful in conflicts you expect to not be world-ending but if its job it&#39;s to huck nuclear weapons, missiles are cheaper. </p>\n\n<p>Another example is the USMC&#39;s landing craft. The previous Commandant wanted to turn the USMC into an A2/AD missile chucking force landing on random and small islands and atolls and fire missiles from there. They need a lot of landing ships carrying company-sized units to saturate the Pacific and they need them quick. They even dismiss the tanks and artillery. The Navy started working on the concept, adding more and more features to.make them more survivable. The features make the thing more expensive, so the need to make the ship bigger and carry more people to make it worthwhile. So instead of the USMC having 50, they will get 4. Meanwhile, the Marines don&#39;t have the ships to train and practice with. The Corp has already disbanded the enablers that made them work previously. And the Commandant initiating the 2030 redesign term is up without getting his landing ships.</p>\n\n<p>Second, leg infatry doesn&#39;t have IFF codes at anything less than rock-throwing distance in the mordern war. Why isn&#39;t that a problem? Because people know how to use deconfliction, coordinating instructions, unit boundaries, and limits of fire. I tried participating in some rudimentary map exercises and immediately, it became obvious what are the first concerns: &quot;this is your left and right limits of advance, here&#39;s your left and right limits of fire, don&#39;t go beyond this phase line before tellling everyone and get an acknowledgment&quot;. Does it slow things down? Yes. Does it prevent you being fired upon by your colleagues? Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Third, air defence has deconfliction like that, too. Something like: &quot;friendly aircraft will use this corridor in this time window, when you detect a target in this deconflicted time and space, don&#39;t automatically open fire on every airborne target in the deconflicted window and zone. Use IFF confirmation before firing&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>CUAS systems are needed and need to be multi tiered and layered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Intergrated Air Defence System (IADS). old story. Western forces neglected to have them, but it&#39;s not an impossible concept.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "> FPV drones are a pandoras box that shouldn't have been opened as using them means you can't use your CUAS systems. These hyper cheap drones that you can have hundreds of thousands of will not have IFF codes and will MASSIVELY limit what your CUAS can do. What this means is that if you have FPV drones, by definition you will also allow OPFOR to have FPV drones. The ideal system is to have a very expansive CUAS system with radars fires EW etc that can take down FPV drones but will avoid shooting down your 50k drones with IFF codes. Irregular forces who won't possess lancet type drones will likely use FPVs for harassment in places and times CUAS systems are inactive.\n\nIFF for a cheap, disposable weapon system like a FPV drone doesn't have to be 100 % effective in preventing friendly fire. 95 % would be good enough. Something as simple as an IR strobe would potentially work, along the lines of what is currently used on ATGMs. \n\nI do think, strongly, that directed energy weapons will be a very strong counter to slow, low-thermal mass drones like the current FPV threat. Western laser systems are aiming to shoot down mortar and artillery shells, which are fairly massive and move near the speed of sound so they have a lot of thermal mass and a lot of convective cooling. Electronic warfare should also be more effective, especially if it is has point defense (in the form of a laser or maser system) to keep it alive. I'm really not clear on why both sides aren't being more successful in jamming analog drones. Perhaps they are and we're just seeing the successful attacks but 9/10 FPV drones are jammed. \n\nI also think that the people who think FPV drones can be made autonomous for cheap are off their rocker. To make an autonomous system you will need a lot of computing power and hence a lot of power. FPV drones work, now, because the human in the loop is the guidance system. If you don't have the human there, the drone needs to be a lot bigger and more expensive. Maybe you can have a datalink back to a control vehicle that has the electronics, but again you're back to needing line-of-sight to avoid jamming.",

What\u2019s important to consider is the capabilities of potential counters to the drone threat and how they will evolve. Shooting down drones is not particularly challenging, and absolutely can be done cheaply. This is a perfect niche for gun based anti air systems, directed energy weapons, and even drones meant to destroy other drones. As these evolve it will force drone manufacturers to evolve as well. \n\nYou mentioned $100 dollar drones, to the best of my knowledge we haven\u2019t seen drones at this price point and the vast majority are closer to 1000$, particularly when you factor in the cost of strapping an RPG 7 to them. What this means is there is a significant potential to have air defense be far cheaper than the drones they are shooting down. Directed energy weapons could likely kill a drone for less than a dollar, mass production of 20-30mm air burst could likely do it for less than a 100$. This in turn requires you to factor in the probability of a kill with these drones. We have seen accounts from Ukraine that only 1/10 drones scores a successful hit and most of those are likely against infantry, not tanks or more valuable targets. When the battlefield is saturated with short range air defense we may see that stat rise to the point where only 1/50 or 1/100 scores a kill. If all your drones cost 1000$ you are looking at 50-100,000 per kill. At that point you might as well use an AGTM or something like a GMLRS or precision artillery shell. As it doesn\u2019t come with the logistical burden inherent in operating 100 drones. \n\nThis in turn means drones will likely evolve into bigger stand-off weapon platforms meant to quickly deploy and fire such weapons themselves. You mentioned the 50,000$ drone. And I think this is likely the point of equilibrium we will evolve towards. At that price you can get a decent payload and some stand-off range optics which would enable you to conduct artillery spotting and recon out of range of SHORAD (gun based at least) systems. While deploying systems like hellfire or other purpose built weapons. Ultimately the drone revolution we are seeing might simply give us a replacement for the attack helicopter, only time will tell.",

Its just too important a capability. The friendly fire issue is just one that will have to be solved by procedures, networking, and giving platoons an anti-drone capability as well as a drone capability. Either an anti-drone gun, or an [anti-drone gun](https://special-ops.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-marine-with-M2-Browning-machine-gun.jpeg), or some kind of cheaper MANPAD-missile system.

The big takeaway from this war re: drones are that you need C-Drone systems to address not the whole problem, but each level of the problem. Just as you have GBAD to address not every aircraft, but many different kinds of aircraft missions. Another big takeaway is that at $50k a piece basically anyone can field a pretty large and sophisticated drone force from Russia, to Afghanistan, to the cartels and eventually even domestic criminal organizations. Its really going to fundamentally change how organizations carry out any kind of operation in space, and the options available to launch any kind of offensive operation or attacks. The expectation for the US/NATO has to be that any future war will include significant drone operations on both sides. Where I think the west may enjoy some, perhaps temporary, superiority is in C-Drone weapons, EW, and that nature. If I were advising the Pentagon I would tell them you have to buy drones because you need them and not doing so creates a capability gap, but buying C-Drone and ECM is where you create the capability gap that gets all those guys' dicks hard.",

Scary shit and people will come up with this.\n\nRight now most of the drone types I have seen are primarily recon or kill systems.\n\nWhat I am personally waiting for is either low to mid priced drones/drone swarms with EW capabilities in combination with \"cheap\" mass jammers on trucks or stationary air defence to become way more common.\n\nRight now we got mostly Reaper type drones acting with impunity, mid price long range drones that can overwhelm air defences and mass produced anti-personnel/recon drones for close range squads.\n\nReaper drones and the like I would treat like regular fighter jets or bombers. Either detect them in time and destroy them or get fucked.\n\nA short term stationary jamming field near high priority targets away from the front could for a short term incapacitate mid price drones. For example creating loads of static or fake targets near an airfield, while the fighters/bombers stationed can work around it by either human operation in combination with a good command structure or more advanced EW capabilities. This does require time to prepare and properly trained personnel.\n\nAt close range in the field a large enough drone swarm with sufficient EW capacity could deny the use of recon drones by squads or shut down mass produced anti-personnel drones over a limited area. If needed moving to follow the threat. In combination with massive mobility and limited targeting opportunities, part of the swarm could possibly also be utilised as kill drones.\n\nIt is very possible I am underestimating the current EW defences and part of these systems are already in place.\n\nEDIT: Not going into large/midsize/boat drones. We are using smallish swarms as a replacement for fireworks displays right now. I think the true value of cheap drones would be either a jamming/disruptive swarm, a mobile minefield or targeting vulnerable structures behind enemy lines.\n\nExcluding EW, we have seen just single drones dropping grenades or whatever on single units. Be it a tank, machine gun pit or some Russian bj ceremony. Also infiltrated troops/rebels behind enemy lines attacking refineries or symbolic targets. I am just waiting for the first true drone terrorist attack outside Russia. Either targeting a sports event or for example critical points in the electricity grid.\n\nConsider some of the WW1 meatgrinders in Ukraine or civil warfare in open land, for example a desert.

This might easily change if the West and Ukraine are given a few years to catch their breath and improve their military production.\n\nSuslov believes that Ukraine is intensifying high-visibility strikes in Russian strategic depth in the hope of provoking a Russian (over)reaction that would generate Western outrage and mobilise support.\n\nThe threat of French/Western intervention is clearly aimed at intimidating Russia into stopping its advance. In Suslov's opinion, there is just one rational response - to warn France that its entry in Ukraine means a direct war with Russia. Not only will the French units be targeted, but also the NATO logistic bases they rely on. Suslov concludes: \"In the event of a massive NATO military response to Russia, it is necessary to be ready - and unequivocally declare such readiness - to use the entire arsenal of the Russian Federation against NATO countries - in full accordance with the Russian nuclear doctrine\".\n\n\n**Strengthen deterrence**\n\nhttps://www.kommersant . ru/doc/6620406\n\nby Dmitry Suslov\n\nDeputy Director at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow\n\nOn April 4, the 75th anniversary of the founding of NATO was celebrated in Brussels, but despite the solemn speeches, many foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Alliance member countries who participated in the meeting spoke with alarm about the future. And this is no wonder. The military conflict in Ukraine has reached one of the most dangerous moments in terms of the likelihood of a direct military clash between Russia and NATO with further spillover to the level of nuclear war.\n\nAlthough for Russia the stakes in this conflict are higher than for the West (for it the question is to remain not only as a great power, but also as a single country as such and an independent subject of international relations), the West also perceives this conflict as existential and its own. over the past two years, he has done everything to ensure that he becomes one for him. The political elites of the US and EU countries are convinced that their own political future, the place of the West in the international system, and the future of the world order as such depend on the outcome of the Ukrainian conflict.\n\nIf both sides perceive the conflict as existential, then they simply cannot afford to lose, and the risks of escalation are highest when one side is on the verge of defeat. Apparently we have come to this brink.\n\nDue to a number of factors (the failure of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in 2023; the interruption of military assistance to Ukraine due to internal political strife in the United States; the improvement of Russian military tactics and the stability of its economy; the rapid increase in military production in Russia and the slow one in the West; a steady influx of reinforcements to Russian troops at the expense of volunteers and the failure of mobilization in Ukraine and so on) the Kiev regime - and with it the West - found themselves on the verge of military defeat. Almost all military experts in both Russia and the West admit that the balance of power on the battlefield has steadily shifted in favor of Moscow, and neither the resumption of American assistance to Kyiv, nor the transfer of F-16 fighters to it, nor a new wave of mobilization in Ukraine will change it. at least quickly.\n\nIn this situation, Kyiv sharply intensified its sabotage activities against Russia, and French President Emmanuel Macron raised the question of bringing armed forces of Western countries, starting with France, into the territory of Ukraine. Both are fraught with escalation.\n\nTerrorist attacks and sabotage are aimed at throwing Russia off balance and provoking it into a military response that, as Kiev probably thinks, will force the leadership in the United States and Europe to qualitatively increase military assistance to Ukraine and, perhaps, even lift restrictions on its use against \" old\" Russian territories.\n\nEmmanuel Macron\u2019s initiative is an attempt to frighten Russia: to prevent it from defeating the Kyiv regime and ensuring its survival, blackmailing the Russian Federation with a direct military clash with the troops of the nuclear country France and the NATO nuclear alliance as a whole.\n\nIt is noteworthy that simultaneously with Emmanuel Macron\u2019s escalatory escapades, talk in the West about \u201cfreezing\u201d the Ukrainian conflict along the existing front line without resolving it intensified. It is spoken about openly not only by mainstream experts close to the administration of US President Joe Biden and influential retirees such as the former US permanent representative to NATO Ivo Daalder, but also, for example, by the head of the faction of the ruling Social Democratic party in the German Bundestag, Rolf M\u00fctzenich. And US Presidential National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan defines Ukraine\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d as its preservation as a state not controlled by Russia and integrated with the West, without specifying within what borders.\n\nFor Russia, such an option seems unprofitable: Ukraine will remain \u201canti-Russia on steroids,\u201d a source of military, sabotage and intelligence threat, and its militarization and use as a tool in the fight against Russia will only intensify. Moreover, taking a pause in conditions when Russia now has a significant advantage in weapons and military equipment, but in a few years may lose it as a result of the development of the military-industrial complex in the West, is \u201csnatching defeat from the hands of victory.\u201d\n\nFor the West, a \u201cfreeze\u201d may be the most profitable scenario: it will prevent Kyiv\u2019s defeat in the short term and will allow it to gain time for revenge in the near future, when Ukraine and the West (expecting to overtake Russia in terms of military production in a few years due to its much larger economy) ) will be ready for this.\n\nThus, they may try to blackmail Russia: or it agrees to unfavorable scenarios of \u201cfreezing\u201d or prolonging the conflict for an indefinite future, but without inflicting a decisive defeat on Kyiv (and the West is working all this time to return the material advantage in its favor) , or there is a danger of a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO.\n\nWhatever Emmanuel Macron's motivation, his position is an example of strategic frivolity and irresponsibility. It confirms the weakening of fear of nuclear war among Western and especially European elites (refusal to believe that it is possible) and emphasizes the need for a qualitative strengthening of the Russian deterrence policy.\n\nThe scenario proposed by President Macron would mean the actual entry of nuclear France into a war against nuclear Russia, even if French troops were not the first to open fire on Russian troops. At a minimum, they would constrain the actions of the Russian side and free up significant reserves of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for actions against Russia. Such a situation would create direct preconditions for a nuclear war: unlike the last Cold War, today the most likely scenario for its outbreak is precisely a non-nuclear military clash between Russia and NATO, which, if it begins and develops into a large-scale war, will inevitably spill over to the nuclear level. That is why the most effective way to reduce the threat of nuclear war today is to prevent any military clashes between nuclear powers and their allies.\n\nEmmanuel Macron calls for the opposite. And the underlying misconception is that even if France actually enters the war, Russia will not risk using conventional, much less nuclear, weapons against it. By trying to blackmail Russia with the threat of nuclear war, Emmanuel Macron only makes its prospect more likely.\n\nThis scenario can be prevented by qualitatively strengthening the Russian policy of deterrence and deterrence and convincing the French President and his associates that Russia will not flinch and that the threat of nuclear war if his proposals are implemented is real.\n\nTo do this, it is advisable to officially declare that Russia will consider the deployment of regular troops of France (or any other NATO country) in Ukraine as involvement in a direct war against Russia and on this basis will not only try to destroy the corresponding Western troops on the territory of Ukraine, but will also is ready to launch non-nuclear strikes on the military infrastructure, transport hubs and communication systems of the relevant NATO countries, preventing the possibility of replenishing their troops in Ukraine. In the event of a massive NATO military response to Russia, it is necessary to be ready - and unequivocally declare such readiness - to use the entire arsenal of the Russian Federation against NATO countries - in full accordance with the Russian nuclear doctrine and the \u201cFundamentals of Russian state policy in the field\u201d adopted in 2020 nuclear deterrence.\"\n\nIn the context of a brutal hybrid war, only a revival of the fear of nuclear war and the feeling that it might actually happen can prevent a scenario in which it may become inevitable.",

There is your difference, I don\u2019t know how to make that clearer.\n\nSo any blockade equals a war? The Soviets started a war against West Germany and the West in 1948 then? No, of course not and no one claims such. If a war didn\u2019t \u201cgo hot\u201d it isn\u2019t a war. \n\nSo you agree that the Russian crimes are incomparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis?

Putin has also threatened, for example, Latvia with <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/putin-latvia/\">consequences inside their country</a>, which is the same reasoning he publicly applied to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, western leaders fervently deny any direct confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>So, to recap: The statements of western leaders are generally closer aligned to previous Russian statements, they aren&#39;t specific responses to Russian statements and are less frequent.</p>\n\n<p>Russian leadership responds frequently to specific western actions, makes numerous, specific, grave threats and does so frequently, despite furious western denials of such claims.</p>\n\n<p>This is as strong an indicator as we&#39;ll get for Russia taking western threats more serious than vice versa. It also makes sense within conflict theory in political science.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re welcome to continue making the claim that both sides are doing the same thing, aber da scheint der Wunsch Vater des Gedanken.</p>\n</div>",

Russia and Ukraine have lots of linkage you can point to, historical overlap; even a common national myth(with divergent explanations of course), strong trade before the war, sociopolitical similarities, religious overlap, and even some language similarities(eastern Ukraine). Then there's the familial bonds which had been strong before the war. None of this is very much relevant when talking about Finland or Sweden.\n\nI'd point to one analogy, the concept of Greater Serbia did not include all of ex-Yugoslavia; it included most of it, but not the northernmost parts of Croatia and none of Slovenia; because in the proponents of that revanchist policy those places were not Serbian. Same goes for modern Russian revanchism, Finland and Sweden are definitely not part of the \"Russian world\", but even when talking about Ukraine specifically, they don't include all of Ukraine into that formation. All of eastern Ukraine and some of central Ukraine; but not the western part.\n\nYou can look at why Russia looks at Ukraine like that in different ways, the revanchist angle has a lot of backing and is consistent with Putin's statements so far. From a pure realpolitik perspective, it also makes a lot of sense; taking over Eastern Ukraine(and maybe parts of central Ukraine) would be very doable, because people would resist at a far lower level than in west of Ukraine; furthermore integrating the new lands would be much easier in sociopolitical terms. \n\nSo those are the reasons FOR Russia to treasure those parts, but there's also the other side of the motivation. If Russia doesn't control those parts of Ukraine that it sees as the most important, but are instead in the hands of the \"Western Elite Who Wants to Destroy Russia\", then that is a security threat--not because of NATO or military means(here Finland/Sweden prove this is a red herring), but because of peaceful evolution theory. It isn't just Putin being paranoid, Soviets were too, as is/was China's ruling party. In their eyes, the collective West has been trying to utilize some form of hybrid war that uses democratic principles to create discontent in countries not under West's control, that eventually allow it to take over. Putin has usually talked about \"color revolutions\", others have talked about \"regime change\", and so on; these are all the same thing.\n\nConsidering the long history of peaceful evolution theory, and how a lot of states around the world act against the West; I don't think it's a dumb conspiracy; but at the same time I think it isn't as actively pushed as it is usually presented. China has for example lead a 'purge' of cultural ideas that it sees to be imported from the West; you can look at the disappearances of various K-pop idols, or video game bans. North Korea has at various points heavily restricted the flow of South Korea's cultural exports. USSR's iron curtain was an attempt to protect against these influences as well.",
