After studying publicly available information on the U.S. arsenal, the Ukrainians concluded that the Pentagon had a surplus of A-10s, the aging, subsonic attack aircraft known as Thunderbolts. \u201cThey can deliver heavier bombs, and we could use them against [Russian] tank columns,\u201d he said.\n\n>He asked for 100. Austin, he said, again replied it was \u201cimpossible\u201d and \u201cmade no sense.\u201d The planes, Reznikov said he was told, were old-fashioned and slow, a \u201csqueaky target\u201d for Russia\u2019s formidable air defenses. \u201cThis was understandable to me. It was reasonable. I said okay,\u201d Reznikov recalled, throwing up his hands in mock surrender.\n\n>But the rejections, and explanations, continued.\n\n>Poland offered to send some of its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets, but only if they were transferred to Ukraine via the U.S. air base in Germany. The Americans said they had no objections to the planes, but that transferring them from a U.S. installation sent the wrong message to Moscow.\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>Reznikov remains optimistic. Tanks, he said, are \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d and German minds would change if the United States \u201clike a big brother,\u201d would supply the M1 Abrams. \u201cOne. Just a symbolic step, and after that I\u2019m sure we will have Leopards from Germany, we will have British and French tanks.\u201d\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>Told of Reznikov\u2019s comments, the first senior defense official said even one M1 was out of the question. Used by U.S. forces in Iraq, the massive battle tanks were \u201chard for us to sustain and maintain. It would be impossible for them.\u201d Besides, \u201cI think that the Ukrainians now have more tanks on the battlefield than the Russians do. \u2026 The Russians have graciously donated a lot\u201d the official said sarcastically, noting the equipment that Moscow\u2019s forces abandoned in hasty retreats from Kyiv and Kharkiv.\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>\u201cWe also have no interest in escalating this war in a manner than makes it the United States versus Russia,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cBut nobody gets a veto over what the United States provides Ukraine.\u201d",

After studying publicly available information on the U.S. arsenal, the Ukrainians concluded that the Pentagon had a surplus of A-10s, the aging, subsonic attack aircraft known as Thunderbolts. \u201cThey can deliver heavier bombs, and we could use them against [Russian] tank columns,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>He asked for 100. Austin, he said, again replied it was \u201cimpossible\u201d and \u201cmade no sense.\u201d The planes, Reznikov said he was told, were old-fashioned and slow, a \u201csqueaky target\u201d for Russia\u2019s formidable air defenses. \u201cThis was understandable to me. It was reasonable. I said okay,\u201d Reznikov recalled, throwing up his hands in mock surrender.</p>\n\n<p>But the rejections, and explanations, continued.</p>\n\n<p>Poland offered to send some of its Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets, but only if they were transferred to Ukraine via the U.S. air base in Germany. The Americans said they had no objections to the planes, but that transferring them from a U.S. installation sent the wrong message to Moscow.</p>\n\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n\n<p>Reznikov remains optimistic. Tanks, he said, are \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d and German minds would change if the United States \u201clike a big brother,\u201d would supply the M1 Abrams. \u201cOne. Just a symbolic step, and after that I\u2019m sure we will have Leopards from Germany, we will have British and French tanks.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n\n<p>Told of Reznikov\u2019s comments, the first senior defense official said even one M1 was out of the question. Used by U.S. forces in Iraq, the massive battle tanks were \u201chard for us to sustain and maintain. It would be impossible for them.\u201d Besides, \u201cI think that the Ukrainians now have more tanks on the battlefield than the Russians do. \u2026 The Russians have graciously donated a lot\u201d the official said sarcastically, noting the equipment that Moscow\u2019s forces abandoned in hasty retreats from Kyiv and Kharkiv.</p>\n\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe also have no interest in escalating this war in a manner than makes it the United States versus Russia,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cBut nobody gets a veto over what the United States provides Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It's said that for Russia, artillery is it's own maneuver element. What that means is Russian doctrine kind of subordinates the maneuver elements to fires, which is the opposite of how the West does it, or at least how it's doctrinally done it. \n\nIn terms of artillery, its function is to suppress, neutralize, or destroy targets, and those three terms have different meaning. Suppress puts enemy out action while taking fire, and typically amounts to <3% enemy losses. Neutralize means being out of action a bit longer after firing spots, with enemy losses usually between 3-10%. Destroy means take out of action much longer or permanently after fire ends, with losses usually at 30% but sometimes higher. \n\nWestern artillery (and CAS) is typically used to suppress an enemy allowing ground maneuver elements to... maneuver on them. Part of that is tradition but a lot of it is about practicality and restraints. It's the same reason our maneuver brigades have more support units and less maneuver battalions than Ukraine or Russian equivalent (who are very similar), and especially why US only has one battalion of artillery per brigade instead of three. Not that the three that Ukraine and Russia both have wouldn't be cool, but it's not possible to properly supply them. Hint hint\n\nDestruction with arty sounds awesome but it takes a lot of time to achieve, lots of ammo, especially without PGMs, which Russian doesn't possess much at the tactical level (they only have a small number of laser guided arty rounds, while most guided MLRS are military district level assets). But the Russians love it because it's a long standing cultural tradition, they rely on quasi science bullshit  using extremely complex mathematical formulas with nomograms that all Russian officers are required to learn during their 4-5 year academy training. Russian battalions are especially light in staff because of the doctrinal belief of using said formulas to execute large scale battle drills. \n\nSo in the case of attacking a UAF fixed defensive position in the Donbas, the Russians input the variables into their fires formulas and that spits out how many rounds it'll take and how long, and then they do as a their fires plan thinking it'll work and actually destroy Ukraine forces, causing them to retreat or be subject to a breakthrough. However, the formulas aren't accurate, what is supposed to take weeks is actually taking months, or never.\n\nWhat are the Russians to do? a) take a hard look at their doctrine in the middle of a nasty war and shit can most of it? b) Stay the course. They routinely choose b).\n\n> I just find it implausible that Western tactics can accomplish what Russia does with one tenth the shells and no air support.\n\nBack in May June, Russia was attacking the Donbas salient everywhere doing a broad front attack. The whole salient was broken down into CAA level sectors and each essentially prosecuted their own fight. There are pros and cons for doing that but the biggest con is an inability to actually mass, supplies, and firepower in one decisive location, instead it's spread out. Most western doctrine doesn't support broad front attacks as the Russians do them. If we did do them (and we have) it's because we're in a very privileged logistical situation, with no manpower shortages either. \n\nUkraine shouldn't be trying to copy Russia, they should fight smart, rely on maneuver over fires, especially knowing the Russians can't maneuver for shit. Since the war started, Russian fires can only get resupplied when the lines essentially become frozen, so don't allow them to freeze. But that's easier said that done, not only does that come with a political cost Zelensky won't accept (retreat and abandon territory just to unbalance the Russians) but it's rather complex too, and it's likely the UAF might not have the ability to succeed at highly mobile maneuver warfare if they don't have the trained officers  in command and staff roles at the battalion and brigade level, and higher.\n\nAlso, that's something almost nobody brings up but is very important. I mentioned it in the spring, but Ukraine doesn't have divisions or corps HQs, they have no permanent military command levels between brigade and the four regional operational commands, just some ad hoc tactical and operational level  ones. Like when the Commander in Chief of Ukrainian Ground Forces took personal command of the Kharkiv counteroffensive, a job that should have gone to a corps command. The reason ad hoc commands suck is they don't possess an actual staff, they don't come with the support units especially communications but also logistical, transportation, maintenance, administration, or even fires that would normally be present in a division, corps, or army level command. That's a MAJOR deficiency that hasn't been fixed that will cause operational issues for the Ukrainians. Why can't they fix it? Where are the thousands of officers supposed to come from? Where are all those enabler units supposed to come from?",

I don&#39;t think its really possible to make long-term predictions about the war with the information that is publicly available (if someone had told me in June of this year that Ukraine would have liberated Kherson and expelled the Russians from Kharkiv I&#39;d have thought it was just gigacope, for example), but I really have to worry that Ukraine just isn&#39;t going to be able to effectively sustain efforts to liberate occupied territories if the current pattern of Western military aid shipments continues.</p>\n</div>",

Russian mobilization has been a bit (lol) rough, but I worry that if they continue to \"escalate\" and send more at least decently equipped units to more parts of the line, it'll become harder and harder for large-scale counteroffensives to take place and succeed without suffering massive casualties. Then again, this was pretty much the exact same thing I was thinking when the Kherson counteroffensive started, and we all know how that turned out. \n\n\nI feel like I'm still at the point where I think to myself \"okay well surely the Russians will get their act together enough to at least consolidate their current holdings\", only for that to not happen. I guess its still a leftover sense of \"okay things have been good for Ukraine but surely they won't end up being *that* good\" that I think a lot of people have had as a way of dampening expectations.",

BUT:\n\n>We are dependent on the StVZO (German traffic law), dependent on civilian mechanics, dependent on lengthy spare parts deliveries, dependent on ourselves. For me as a user, the \"readiness\" of a vehicle consists of: \"technically ok\" (drives, radios, shoots), \"has been serviced correctly\" (i.e. technical inspection, if necessary repair/replacement of parts - gun, hull alike), \"complies with StVZO\" - if necessary, a reflector or turn signal must be refitted, mirrors replaced or license plates renewed.\n\n>The Puma, as well as the PzH2000, as a modern combat vehicle, in addition to standard wear parts such as sprockets, chain, tube, barrel, also possesses other parts that may fail even quicker due to their technical complexity & lack of longevity.\n\n>What does this mean? \n\n>1. the technical inspections take longer, the vehicle is not available during this time. One is in this case - with the Puma - dependent on the civilian industry, their working hours, their motivation, their diligence.

The long absence of vehicles from individual platoons means that gaps have to be filled by vehicles from other platoons or even other companies - depending on the mission situation.

In the best case there are MAXIMUM as many vehicles available as the TO&E of the unit specifies. So there is no reserve. So ONE failure already causes sloppiness, swapping, etc.. But how does one learn so beautifully: \"Reserves are always to be formed\".\n\n>Conclusion: as a user and troop officer, in my eyes the solution would be to free a not yet fully developed weapon system from this vicious circle by forming a circulation reserve.

Right now without a significant change in resources, such an attack would be difficult in a fast manner.  Russia has learned what I can from Kupiansk, Izyum, and to extend Kherson, how much it has learned has remained unseen.\n\nKherson benefited from a slight airpower advantage due to airports being further from Russian territory and reduced presence from the Russian navy.  Kupiansk and Izyum fell due to orders to hold until after there was a breakthrough and full rout had to happen.  Russia is showing little signs they are trying to have any significant push in the southern region except for hostilities that keep Ukraine engaged.\n\nDespite throwing drones at Bakmut, Russia's real goal right now is to hold land, rather than take it, the longer they can throw troops on certain battle areas, the more likely they can dig in and make a defensive stand.  Russia knows now this is not going to be over, I doubt Putin can stand to live past the 1-year mark and is probably doing everything he can internally to prevent his demise.\n\nWith the current war of attrition occurring, should Putin stay in power past the 1-year mark, what he will have is more troops better trained while forcing Ukraine to lose good troops to mass waves of drones (the people, not the mechanical).  \n\nWhen asking what offensive UA can take, the answer can be the area Ukraine can use combined arms strategies to break defensive lines, supply and sustain an attack, and push deeper into Russian held areas - while accepting significant casualties.  It is not to say Melitopol couldn't be a target of such a strategy, but its features don't lend well to it.\n\nSo overall Ukraine needs the resources and strategy to pull off a great frontal assault or needs to do something unexpected, such as an amphibious assault on Armyosk and Peredmistne to cut off supply lines to Kherson except for those from the East.  Another crazy option is to head into Russian territory north of Topoli to encircle Urazovo to cut off supplies to Svatve to the north.  Each of these has very difficult hurdles, such as has the west provided enough boats to stage enough of a beach head to take those areas in the south and is Ukraine ballsy enough to enter Russian territory even if it is strategically sound.  Each of these maneuvers would certainly cause serious redeployment of Russian forces and put a hamper on any spring offensive planned by the Russians.\n\nUltimately I would suspect outside these crazy ideas, Zelenski was in DC to negotiate more than just Patriots, but the military equipment to conduct combined arms tactics to face Russia directly on one of the front lines while holding them off in areas they can for as long as they can.",

Not a single Bradley (thousands available, no established logistics), not a single Stryker (some available, particularly Gun System variants, logistically several LAV variants in country already), no more M113s (2000 in storage, widely used now).\n\nWhat we do send are armored trucks, surplus MRAPs, Hummers and more Hummers.  Additionally, the US has facilitated a number of BMP transfers from allies through cash or ring style upgrades.\n\nIs this enough?  Hummers are useful I'm sure, but they aren't appropriate for troop transports in contested areas- though the US will ship a butt load of Hummers to any quasi ally who will stand around and smile a lot. \n\nThe lack of Bradleys is 'understandable', though I don't agree with the reasoning: Maintenance could be supported in Poland just as it is for M270s. The number of surplus strykers is fairly low, and though I still think M1128s could fill a direct fire Nitch, that isn't really part of an APC discussion.   I'm baffled we haven't seen more M113s though, as they appear very useful-  Fast, scrappy, and reliable. The aluminum armor isn't all that good, but the M113 variants have been one of the few operationally useful vehicles in the mud, and most of the M113s taken out in combat were hit by weapons/mines capable of taking out just about any other APC in the theater. \n\nI don't know what to make of the MRAPs though.  They appear to have assumed APC roles, and have shown excellent protection. It was impressive watching Wolfhounds (British service Cougar 6x6 MRAPs) doing direct fire support clearing streets in Bakmut the other day).  We've sent quite a few and are sending 37 more in this week's package.\n\nSo what's your thoughts on supplying APCs to Ukraine? Are enough available in odd corners of NATO ally warehouses to meet demand? Will we ever see Bradleys or more M113s? Are the MRAPs an acceptable alternative to more M113s or even BMPs?",

This means the structure is formally pretty antiquated, but the body more or less dispenses with the letter of these agreements to keep the institution working. \n\nThe most significant changes to the UNSC have been with membership, obviously Russia replaced the USSR and the PRC replaced the ROC. This is something you see crop up a bit with Russia, that the agreements refer to the USSR which no longer exists so that seat is defunct. But this a thin argument, because in terms of norms the SC and other UN members accepted Russia as a replacement for the USSR. And the move to put the PRC provides precedent, IIRC the mechanism to swap the ROC and PRC on the SC was a vote in the general assembly which basically just declared that in 1949 China lost its representation on the SC and adding the PRC would restore this recognition. It sets the precedent that the continuity of government is a legitimate way to transfer UNSC membership. \n\nBut using these precedents it seems to me that removing a legitimate member (ie Russia) isn\u2019t really possible. There is no mechanism or precedent. Moreover any precedent, such as the Russia =\\= USSR, would probably also undermine the PRC\u2019s claim to a seat. Obviously that\u2019s just not going to happen. So we\u2019d really need to talk about new structuring agreements. There are proposals here for restructuring the SC, but none of them have much of a chance of getting through. The most popular of which would be adding members like India. All of this would probably require a treaty level change, and would be packaged with a more general SC reform. \n\nBut anyway Russia wouldn\u2019t be the only player to lose out if somehow they found a way to revoke SC membership. One wonders if France and the UK really deserve to be full time members, especially when Germany, Brazil (currently a temporary member), SK, and others are left off.

Rheinmetall has the reputation of being just a better manufacturer (deserved or not), and would likely crowd out someone else like Breda who currently benefits from a bilateral national relationship (again, as Rheinmetall has benefited from a bilateral relationship with the US).\n\nMaybe this isn't a bad thing, does Europe need so many arms manufacturers? I think everyone you ask will say 'yeah there needs to be more efficiency.' The issue is deciding who is going to bear the burden of cuts. Which companies are we okay going out of business and which workers are we okay putting in unemployment. There are solutions to these problems, your solution (I would call it the free market solution) is viable. Itll just lead to a market driven set of winners and losers. The EU is not well structured for this, and prefers 'all winners' solutions which is why the international development angle is IMO more viable. EXCEPT that it has its own problems with red tape and political bickering, which makes it unattractive in its own right. And of course there is always the 'fuck it buy American' solution which is viable, and currently popular, but leads to a whole *different* set of issues. And so the system returns to a default resting state where the big countries all build their own national systems, regardless of inefficiencies, and the small countries buy German/Ex-Soviet(Ex-East German) surplus.\n\nEuropean politics are a pain in the ass, because its very easy currently for one country to thwart the momentum of the whole Union. I would personally expect that a reform of the EU in the direction of tighter American/German style federalism (specifically in terms of reforming the EU Commission) is a precondition to any kind of serious defense standardization.
