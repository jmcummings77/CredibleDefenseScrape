Israel would not strike Beirut, Hezbollah would not strike Haifa. \n\nSo what I'm saying is that we shouldn't underestimate Hezbollah at all. Its strategic arsenal is big and mobile enough to make Israel bleed. At the same time we shouldn't fall into the trap that the IDF is incompetent.

While one theory is that any Israeli incursion would quickly lead to all out war there&#39;s also the possibility that deterrence holds and both Israel and Hezbollah refrain from striking more strategic targets in the rear. Israel would not strike Beirut, Hezbollah would not strike Haifa. </p>\n\n<p>So what I&#39;m saying is that we shouldn&#39;t underestimate Hezbollah at all. Its strategic arsenal is big and mobile enough to make Israel bleed. At the same time we shouldn&#39;t fall into the trap that the IDF is incompetent. I remember this forum at the beginning of the ground invasion and predictions of high IDF casualties that did not materialize.</p>\n</div>",

You can't say, \"Sure, if Ukraine was having that sort of casualty ratio on the defense it would mean they were doing horribly. But if they had that kind of casualty ration on the defense **and** we took away most of their equipment, they would be doing great.\"\n\n> I don\u2019t think a short helicopter raid is relevant indicator of an ability to take and hold territory.\n\nIsraeli successfully performing fairly large raids deep inside Hezbollah territory  demonstrates a weakness in Hezbollah's ability to stop Israeli forces.\n\n> Especially when there are cases like Bint Jbeil, where the IDF completely failed to take it across almost 3 weeks of fighting.\n\n\"Completely failed to take\" feels like a misleading way to describe the battle of Bint Jbeil. Hezbollah weren't able to stop the Israeli's from taking up positions in the town, but Israel hasn't cleared the city of all Hezbollah forces in the town after three weeks either.\n\n[Here's a contemporary article](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/14/world/middleeast/14troops.html?pagewanted=print) from a reporter that was with Israeli forces:\n\n> Not long ago, this town was known as \u201cthe capital of the resistance,\u201d the most important Hezbollah stronghold in the southern reaches of Lebanon.\n\n> Now Bint Jbail appears largely deserted. Most of the homes are damaged, some pockmarked by bullets or shrapnel and others reduced to piles of stone and concrete by Israeli artillery that continues to pound the village.\n***\n> Late on Wednesday night, Israeli soldiers from the elite Golani Brigade hiked five miles through darkness over tall hills carrying full packs, rifles and heavy jugs of water, arriving here a few hours before dawn. Accompanied by a reporter, they holed up in the second story of an unfinished house.\n***\n> The missile attacks on Thursday morning were dangerous, but nothing like earlier battles in Bint Jbail and nearby villages. \n\nThe whole article points to a situation where Hezbollah fighters initially put up extremely stiff resistance, but weren't able to stop Israeli's from taking up positions in the city. Eventually Hezbollah stopped larger attacks on the Israeli's, and began launching hit and run missile attacks against their positions in the town. If this is is what gets held up as an example of Hezbollah success in that war, it's telling.\n\nBut you're right, the question will be how casualty adverse Israel is. But I think that answers your question. \"Israel could steamroll Hezbollah but won't want to risk a few hundred casualties\" is a position one could take. But one shouldn't be surprised that others think Israel has the _ability_ to defeat Hezbollah. The argument at that point is about political willpower and Israeli tolerance for casualties.",

You can&#39;t say, &quot;Sure, if Ukraine was having that sort of casualty ratio on the defense it would mean they were doing horribly. But if they had that kind of casualty ration on the defense <strong>and</strong> we took away most of their equipment, they would be doing great.&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t think a short helicopter raid is relevant indicator of an ability to take and hold territory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Israeli successfully performing fairly large raids deep inside Hezbollah territory  demonstrates a weakness in Hezbollah&#39;s ability to stop Israeli forces.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Especially when there are cases like Bint Jbeil, where the IDF completely failed to take it across almost 3 weeks of fighting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&quot;Completely failed to take&quot; feels like a misleading way to describe the battle of Bint Jbeil. Hezbollah weren&#39;t able to stop the Israeli&#39;s from taking up positions in the town, but Israel hasn&#39;t cleared the city of all Hezbollah forces in the town after three weeks either.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/14/world/middleeast/14troops.html?pagewanted=print\">Here&#39;s a contemporary article</a> from a reporter that was with Israeli forces:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not long ago, this town was known as \u201cthe capital of the resistance,\u201d the most important Hezbollah stronghold in the southern reaches of Lebanon.</p>\n\n<p>Now Bint Jbail appears largely deserted. Most of the homes are damaged, some pockmarked by bullets or shrapnel and others reduced to piles of stone and concrete by Israeli artillery that continues to pound the village.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Late on Wednesday night, Israeli soldiers from the elite Golani Brigade hiked five miles through darkness over tall hills carrying full packs, rifles and heavy jugs of water, arriving here a few hours before dawn. Accompanied by a reporter, they holed up in the second story of an unfinished house.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The missile attacks on Thursday morning were dangerous, but nothing like earlier battles in Bint Jbail and nearby villages. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The whole article points to a situation where Hezbollah fighters initially put up extremely stiff resistance, but weren&#39;t able to stop Israeli&#39;s from taking up positions in the city. Eventually Hezbollah stopped larger attacks on the Israeli&#39;s, and began launching hit and run missile attacks against their positions in the town. If this is is what gets held up as an example of Hezbollah success in that war, it&#39;s telling.</p>\n\n<p>But you&#39;re right, the question will be how casualty adverse Israel is. But I think that answers your question. &quot;Israel could steamroll Hezbollah but won&#39;t want to risk a few hundred casualties&quot; is a position one could take. But one shouldn&#39;t be surprised that others think Israel has the <em>ability</em> to defeat Hezbollah. The argument at that point is about political willpower and Israeli tolerance for casualties.</p>\n</div>",

You know Hezbollah is more or less reporting their dead in real time right now, right? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>3-1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When countries (and militias, etc) think they\u2019re losing, they commit more troops. This is what Russia did in September 2022. In fact, this is what Israel did in 2006! That Hezbollah never felt the need to commit more than 30% of their forces (the same 30% that was already there to begin with, by the way), shows that Hezbollah never thought they were at risk. <strong>Even when outnumbered 3 to 1</strong>. Hezbollah didn\u2019t need to \u201cfight better\u201d because they <em>won.</em> When an enemy defeats you using 30% of its forces, you didn\u2019t just lose, you lost <em>hard</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The best Israel can do in this war, is fight 2-1 (with <em>total, unsustainable</em> mobilization) or, more likely, parity. If Israel couldn\u2019t win with a 3-1 (later <em>10-1</em>) advantage, how will they be able to win at parity? That\u2019s the crux of my question, which no one has been able to answer in a credible manner.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know how I can explain this more simply. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>operation change of direction 11</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Great! So why did you claim that Israel never tried to occupy south Lebanon in your last comment? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They didn&#39;t try to reoccupy South Lebanon, and I haven&#39;t seen any indication that they were interested in doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To be honest - there isn\u2019t much purpose in continuing this. Have a good night.</p>\n</div>",

Point is: their offensive capability will be fully crippled by the time the US support would stop.</p>\n\n<p>Short of Russia buying thousands of weapons and vehicles (something equivalent to more than half of the NK arsenal), an &quot;outright Russian win&quot; is not very plausible, it&#39;s not even plausible.</p>\n</div>",
