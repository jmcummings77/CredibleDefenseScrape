As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "Time to make a new update about the situation in Avdiivka, using the new infos that the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets posted.\n\nFirst of all, by now almost the entire Central Military District is around Avdiivka. In the last days the 239th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division (41st Army, CMD) has been deployed in Korsun, a village around 10 kilometers south of Horlivka. It would be considerably under-equipped, however: 1600 men, 32 tanks, 20 IFVs and 13 howitzers. Another tank regiment of the 90th Division, currently unnamed, is reported to be around Avdiivka too. It could therefore be either the 6th or the 80th. I find it likely that the T-80BVMs deployed in October in the offensive against Avdiivka may belong to the 90th Division, the only formation (according to the excellent Naalsio) in the CMD that fields T-80BVMs. The 80th and the 239th Regiments also field several T-90Ms among their ranks. \n\nThe 2nd Army of the CMD is entirely in the northern flank of Avdiivka. Part of the 41st Army of the CMD is in the southern one and they are also supported by Spetsnaz GRU detachments attached to these armies.\n\nThe 114th Motorized Brigade (1st Corps, 8th Army, SMD) and the 15th Motorized Brigade (2nd Army) are attacking in the direction of Stepove. They would have been successful in capturing a Ukrainian platoon-stronghold along the forest immediately west of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway, which runs parallel to the tracks. The Russians, according to DeepState, also managed to break through the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railway by capturing some tree lines and advancing about 1 km towards Novokalynove during the last week.\n\nFurther south, in the area of the Coke Plant, units of the 132nd Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) and of the 21st Motorized Brigade (2nd Army) are in action. There is a large presence of convicts from Storm Z detachments in this area and they are also supported by the 109th Rifle Regiment (1st Corps) and other units of the mobilization reserve of this corps. They would have succeeded in taking some positions in the forest just west of the railroad. Elements of the Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade (at least a mechanized battalion supported by the tank company) are active in this area. In addition to the initial garrison of Avdiivka, the Ukrainians deployed the 31st Mech Brigade (which actually was in the area even before the offensive began), a battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade and additional battalions of the Presidential Brigade in the northern flank and a battalion of the 56th Motorized Brigade in the southern flank - these are the Ukrainian units that have arrived so far as reinforcements. \n\nFrom Kamyanka, units of the 21st Motorized Brigade are attacking towards the sand quarry (i.e. the large lake above the city of Avdiivka), without success. From Kruta Balka units of the 114th Motorized Brigade made small advances in the area of the \"Third Pond\" (the first, from the north, among the small lakes to the north-east of the Donetsk Filtration Station, a Ukrainian stronghold east of the H20 Highway).\n\nIn the rear there should also be the 30th Motorized Brigade (2nd Army), i.e. probably the formation deputed to exploit any breakthroughs of the Ukrainian lines in the Stepove/Berdychi direction. \n\nIn the area near Kashtanove there would be elements of the 255th Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division (8th Army, SMD), brought there from the area south of Marinka. They reportedly made slight advances north of Yasynovskyi Lane (for any problems with locating these places - just ask me).\n\nThe industrial area to the west of the junction of the H20 Highway with the unfinished Donetsk's ring road is a very important Ukrainian stronghold, encompassing positions as Promka (an industrial building) already known during the years before 2022, and the vineyards just to the south of this area, firmly in Ukrainian hands. To the west there's the former restaurant \"Tsarska Ohota\", another stronghold. The 1st Motorized Brigade (1st Corps), supported by elements of the 55th Mountain Brigade (41 Army, CMD), is attacking in this area. Fighting is ongoing but no Russian successes are recorded. Instead, in late October the Russians reportedly withdrew from the overpass on the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata railway, which they had captured during the second week of the offensive. The former base of the anti-aircraft missile regiment (Zenith) north-west of Spartak, a very important Ukrainian stronghold, is firmly in UAF hands.\n\nThe bulk of the 55th Mountain Brigade, made up largely of Tuvans, is active in the area around Opytne. In recent weeks there has been an increase in obituaries of soldiers from Tuva. This small Siberian republic has, according to Mediazona's datas, the worst rate of confirmed KIAs relative to population (about 130 per 100k residents), even worse than Buryatia's. This brigade is supported by other units of the 1st Motorized Brigade. In late October they regained the quarry between Vodyane and Opytne, which had been liberated by the Ukrainians during the actions of September. From here the Russians tried to advance north-east, i.e. towards the 9th District (a high-rises neighborhood of Avdiivka), without success. From Vodyane the 9th \"Marine\" Brigade of the 1st Corps is attacking towards Tonenke and Pervomaiske, without success, except for a slight advance along the dachas of the second settlement, in late October. In any case, the Russians control some positions along a part of the last \"latitudinal\" tree line before Sjeverne and Tonenke, which they captured in the first week of the offensive. Ukrainian sources never mentioned it, but from the obituaries I found indications that the 74th Motorized Brigade (41st Army) may be in the rear of the southern flank of Avdiivka, probably aiming to enter the field in case of further advances towards Sjeverne/Tonenke. No idea where the 35th Motorized Brigade (41st Army) is. Also, in the rear of the southern flank there are many smaller units of 1st Corps and the 6th Motorized Division of 3rd Corps. \n\nSouth of Avdiivka there are constant attacks with the aim of annoying the Ukrainians. The 5th Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) carried out attacks in the fields between Krasnohorivka (the one south of Avdiivka) and Marinka, without success. In Marinka, the 103rd Motorized Regiment (150th Motorized Division, 8th Army) continued to push but as usual, without progress. Still further south, the 39th Motorized Brigade (68th Corps, EMD) continues to press towards Novomykhailivka, but without success over the past two weeks, it seems. In the recent days elements of the 29th Army (EMD) have also moved to attack to the east of Mykilske in the Vuhledar sector, advancing a few hundred meters with heavy losses. \n\nAs for my thoughts on Avdiivka, I had discussed them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17guukq/comment/k6klrrw). At the moment it's known that the Russians are using Wagner-style techniques, with assaults by infantry squads. Their goal is to advance as far as possible along the tree lines and consolidate the new positions, in anticipation of a third major armored/mechanized push that the Ukrainians are expecting, using the recently arrived units of the CMD. This is a very bloody strategy for the Russians but they seem willing to tolerate the human and material costs required for such attacks. This strategy, causing very high attrition, also requires continually bringing in new reserves, which they seem to be doing. The Ukrainians are holding out well, but the Russians' intention to close the Avdiivka affair whatever the cost seems clear to everyone. The taking of positions west of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railroad by the Russians is a bad sign, but the question is whether they will be able to bring mechanized units over the railroad, and not just assault squads.",

The Russians, according to DeepState, also managed to break through the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railway by capturing some tree lines and advancing about 1 km towards Novokalynove during the last week.</p>\n\n<p>Further south, in the area of the Coke Plant, units of the 132nd Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) and of the 21st Motorized Brigade (2nd Army) are in action. There is a large presence of convicts from Storm Z detachments in this area and they are also supported by the 109th Rifle Regiment (1st Corps) and other units of the mobilization reserve of this corps. They would have succeeded in taking some positions in the forest just west of the railroad. Elements of the Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade (at least a mechanized battalion supported by the tank company) are active in this area. In addition to the initial garrison of Avdiivka, the Ukrainians deployed the 31st Mech Brigade (which actually was in the area even before the offensive began), a battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade and additional battalions of the Presidential Brigade in the northern flank and a battalion of the 56th Motorized Brigade in the southern flank - these are the Ukrainian units that have arrived so far as reinforcements. </p>\n\n<p>From Kamyanka, units of the 21st Motorized Brigade are attacking towards the sand quarry (i.e. the large lake above the city of Avdiivka), without success. From Kruta Balka units of the 114th Motorized Brigade made small advances in the area of the &quot;Third Pond&quot; (the first, from the north, among the small lakes to the north-east of the Donetsk Filtration Station, a Ukrainian stronghold east of the H20 Highway).</p>\n\n<p>In the rear there should also be the 30th Motorized Brigade (2nd Army), i.e. probably the formation deputed to exploit any breakthroughs of the Ukrainian lines in the Stepove/Berdychi direction. </p>\n\n<p>In the area near Kashtanove there would be elements of the 255th Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division (8th Army, SMD), brought there from the area south of Marinka. They reportedly made slight advances north of Yasynovskyi Lane (for any problems with locating these places - just ask me).</p>\n\n<p>The industrial area to the west of the junction of the H20 Highway with the unfinished Donetsk&#39;s ring road is a very important Ukrainian stronghold, encompassing positions as Promka (an industrial building) already known during the years before 2022, and the vineyards just to the south of this area, firmly in Ukrainian hands. To the west there&#39;s the former restaurant &quot;Tsarska Ohota&quot;, another stronghold. The 1st Motorized Brigade (1st Corps), supported by elements of the 55th Mountain Brigade (41 Army, CMD), is attacking in this area. Fighting is ongoing but no Russian successes are recorded. Instead, in late October the Russians reportedly withdrew from the overpass on the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata railway, which they had captured during the second week of the offensive. The former base of the anti-aircraft missile regiment (Zenith) north-west of Spartak, a very important Ukrainian stronghold, is firmly in UAF hands.</p>\n\n<p>The bulk of the 55th Mountain Brigade, made up largely of Tuvans, is active in the area around Opytne. In recent weeks there has been an increase in obituaries of soldiers from Tuva. This small Siberian republic has, according to Mediazona&#39;s datas, the worst rate of confirmed KIAs relative to population (about 130 per 100k residents), even worse than Buryatia&#39;s. This brigade is supported by other units of the 1st Motorized Brigade. In late October they regained the quarry between Vodyane and Opytne, which had been liberated by the Ukrainians during the actions of September. From here the Russians tried to advance north-east, i.e. towards the 9th District (a high-rises neighborhood of Avdiivka), without success. From Vodyane the 9th &quot;Marine&quot; Brigade of the 1st Corps is attacking towards Tonenke and Pervomaiske, without success, except for a slight advance along the dachas of the second settlement, in late October. In any case, the Russians control some positions along a part of the last &quot;latitudinal&quot; tree line before Sjeverne and Tonenke, which they captured in the first week of the offensive. Ukrainian sources never mentioned it, but from the obituaries I found indications that the 74th Motorized Brigade (41st Army) may be in the rear of the southern flank of Avdiivka, probably aiming to enter the field in case of further advances towards Sjeverne/Tonenke. No idea where the 35th Motorized Brigade (41st Army) is. Also, in the rear of the southern flank there are many smaller units of 1st Corps and the 6th Motorized Division of 3rd Corps. </p>\n\n<p>South of Avdiivka there are constant attacks with the aim of annoying the Ukrainians. The 5th Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) carried out attacks in the fields between Krasnohorivka (the one south of Avdiivka) and Marinka, without success. In Marinka, the 103rd Motorized Regiment (150th Motorized Division, 8th Army) continued to push but as usual, without progress. Still further south, the 39th Motorized Brigade (68th Corps, EMD) continues to press towards Novomykhailivka, but without success over the past two weeks, it seems. In the recent days elements of the 29th Army (EMD) have also moved to attack to the east of Mykilske in the Vuhledar sector, advancing a few hundred meters with heavy losses. </p>\n\n<p>As for my thoughts on Avdiivka, I had discussed them <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17guukq/comment/k6klrrw\">here</a>. At the moment it&#39;s known that the Russians are using Wagner-style techniques, with assaults by infantry squads. Their goal is to advance as far as possible along the tree lines and consolidate the new positions, in anticipation of a third major armored/mechanized push that the Ukrainians are expecting, using the recently arrived units of the CMD. This is a very bloody strategy for the Russians but they seem willing to tolerate the human and material costs required for such attacks. This strategy, causing very high attrition, also requires continually bringing in new reserves, which they seem to be doing. The Ukrainians are holding out well, but the Russians&#39; intention to close the Avdiivka affair whatever the cost seems clear to everyone. The taking of positions west of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railroad by the Russians is a bad sign, but the question is whether they will be able to bring mechanized units over the railroad, and not just assault squads.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "\nSmall focus on other sectors now. The transfer firstly of almost all VDV units deployed there and now of formations of the CMD has weakened tremendously the Kreminna sector, which is now somewhat quiet for the Ukrainians. The Russian grouping in the sector is now made up of the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army, WMD), the new 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th Army (CMD, I believe) and part of the 331st VDV Regiment (98th VDV Division), supported by some BARS and Storm Z detachments. The Ukrainians are reinforcing their grouping in Kupyansk, which in the last week has seen new Russian efforts (with heavy casualties for the latters), with increased involvement by elements of the 1st Tank Army of the WMD (specifically, of the 2nd Motorized Division). They managed to advance as far as around 2 kms, attacking from Pershotravneve. In the area are there are also the 47th Tank Division (1st Tank Army) and the bulk of the 11th Corps (WMD), which have received reinforcements over the past month, while the 6th Army (WMD) continues to press towards Synkivka. The Ukrainian grouping in Kupyansk recently has been reinforced by the 32nd Mech Brigade (from Svatove), looks like the whole of the 21st Mech Brigade too; a battalion each of the 100th and 103rd TDF Brigades (from, respectively, Kreminna and Svatove), a battalion of the 54th Mech Brigade from the Siversk salient and a battalion of the 57th Motorized Brigade from the northern flank of Bakhmut; a battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade too. The Ukrainian grouping became very large, although largely as a result of lateral redeployments from Svatove and especially Kreminna, due to a Russian weakening in these sectors. \n\nIn the Orikhiv sector, the 47th Mech Brigade has been replaced by the 33rd Mech Brigade, which had been inactive for months. They have been able to advance 1 km to the west of Robotyne, warding off the danger of Russian counterattacks towards the settlement. In the attacks they lost five Leopard 2A4s during late October. In any case, the area is very difficult, as the bulk of the 76th VDV Division is deployed west of Robotyne. Several units of the battered 42nd Motorized Division (58th Army, SMD - specifically, several battalions of the 71st and 291st Motorized Regiments) which covers the south-western flank of the Robotyne salient reportedly have been brought to the rear for recovery because of their losses. The losses of the 70th Motorized Regiment of the same division are also huge; on the Russian Telegram channel \"Poisk in UA\" there are numerous video appeals from the wives, mothers or daughters of soldiers of this regiment who complain that they heard from fellow soldiers about the death of their beloved one but the regimental command refuses to confirm this. Wholesale transfers are also taking place: the relatives of a Russian soldier (fallen near Novoprokopivka) from the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (covering the quietish area around Horlivka) were shocked to learn that the soldier's unit had been embedded in the 70th Regiment. Also, the 71st Regiment received reinforcements from the 3rd Corps. These units reportedly have been replaced by the 136th Motorized Brigade, by now the only formation of the 58th Army still fairly fresh, brought here in late October from the rear of the Velyka Novosilka sector. Elements of this brigade have attempted counterattacks from Novoprokopivka towards Robotyne but to no avail. The 1441st Regiment of the Territorial Forces, attached to the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, would have been transferred to Kherson (where the latter had also been sent) to recover losses. \n\nThings in recent weeks have become more interesting along the Dnipro in Kherson Oblast... As I often say, I believe plans of large-scale mechanized crossings to be just a dream, but the Ukrainians are doing the best the reality allows them to do. The bulk of the Ukrainian Marine Corps has been concentrated along the Dnipro and is leading the amphibious actions. The Ukrainians have three stable \"bridgeheads\" (infantry's bridgeheads, supplied by small boats) across the Dnipro: under the Antonovskiy road bridge, under the Antonovskiy railroad bridge, and in the area near Krynky. The latter is very important to highlight as the Ukrainians were able to occupy positions beyond the Konka River and not just beyond the Dnipro (the Konka is a parallel branch of the Dnipro; between the two rivers there are marshy islands that are generally no-man's land). The Ukrainians hold part of the settlement of Krynky and have cut the road from Korsuna to Kozachi Laheri. Despite their large numerical advantage, the poor road network is weighing heavily on the Russians' abilities to counterattack (worsened by the fact that it appears that the bulk of the armored vehicles in the sector are wheeled ones). The \"Birds of Madyar\" drone unit (attached to the 59th Motorized Brigade, employed in the southern flank of Avdiivka) was moved to Kherson to support the actions of the marines. They slaughtered quite a lot of Russian BTR-82s around Krynky. The Russians in the Krynky area brought forward the 26th Motorized Regiment of the 70th Motorized Division and the newly-deployed 144th Motorized Brigade, both part of the new 18th Army (SMD), supported by a couple of Storm Z detachments. Ukrainian artillery would be reaping major losses in the Russian ranks. The 177th Naval Infantry Regiment was brought near the area of the railway bridge (from the Polohy sector), and in the same area there are the few elements of the 7th VDV Division not deployed in the Orikhiv sector (i.e. the 171st Separate Air Assault Battalion, the 162nd Recon Battalion, and the 104th Tank Battalion). They haven't recorded any success in dislodging the Ukrainians from under the bridge, however. The fact that the Russians are being forced to bring reinforcements to Kherson (where their grouping is already large) and they are suffering losses in the face of a limited UAF commitment, is certainly a win-win situation for Ukraine...",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Small focus on other sectors now. The transfer firstly of almost all VDV units deployed there and now of formations of the CMD has weakened tremendously the Kreminna sector, which is now somewhat quiet for the Ukrainians. The Russian grouping in the sector is now made up of the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army, WMD), the new 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th Army (CMD, I believe) and part of the 331st VDV Regiment (98th VDV Division), supported by some BARS and Storm Z detachments. The Ukrainians are reinforcing their grouping in Kupyansk, which in the last week has seen new Russian efforts (with heavy casualties for the latters), with increased involvement by elements of the 1st Tank Army of the WMD (specifically, of the 2nd Motorized Division). They managed to advance as far as around 2 kms, attacking from Pershotravneve. In the area are there are also the 47th Tank Division (1st Tank Army) and the bulk of the 11th Corps (WMD), which have received reinforcements over the past month, while the 6th Army (WMD) continues to press towards Synkivka. The Ukrainian grouping in Kupyansk recently has been reinforced by the 32nd Mech Brigade (from Svatove), looks like the whole of the 21st Mech Brigade too; a battalion each of the 100th and 103rd TDF Brigades (from, respectively, Kreminna and Svatove), a battalion of the 54th Mech Brigade from the Siversk salient and a battalion of the 57th Motorized Brigade from the northern flank of Bakhmut; a battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade too. The Ukrainian grouping became very large, although largely as a result of lateral redeployments from Svatove and especially Kreminna, due to a Russian weakening in these sectors. </p>\n\n<p>In the Orikhiv sector, the 47th Mech Brigade has been replaced by the 33rd Mech Brigade, which had been inactive for months. They have been able to advance 1 km to the west of Robotyne, warding off the danger of Russian counterattacks towards the settlement. In the attacks they lost five Leopard 2A4s during late October. In any case, the area is very difficult, as the bulk of the 76th VDV Division is deployed west of Robotyne. Several units of the battered 42nd Motorized Division (58th Army, SMD - specifically, several battalions of the 71st and 291st Motorized Regiments) which covers the south-western flank of the Robotyne salient reportedly have been brought to the rear for recovery because of their losses. The losses of the 70th Motorized Regiment of the same division are also huge; on the Russian Telegram channel &quot;Poisk in UA&quot; there are numerous video appeals from the wives, mothers or daughters of soldiers of this regiment who complain that they heard from fellow soldiers about the death of their beloved one but the regimental command refuses to confirm this. Wholesale transfers are also taking place: the relatives of a Russian soldier (fallen near Novoprokopivka) from the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (covering the quietish area around Horlivka) were shocked to learn that the soldier&#39;s unit had been embedded in the 70th Regiment. Also, the 71st Regiment received reinforcements from the 3rd Corps. These units reportedly have been replaced by the 136th Motorized Brigade, by now the only formation of the 58th Army still fairly fresh, brought here in late October from the rear of the Velyka Novosilka sector. Elements of this brigade have attempted counterattacks from Novoprokopivka towards Robotyne but to no avail. The 1441st Regiment of the Territorial Forces, attached to the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, would have been transferred to Kherson (where the latter had also been sent) to recover losses. </p>\n\n<p>Things in recent weeks have become more interesting along the Dnipro in Kherson Oblast... As I often say, I believe plans of large-scale mechanized crossings to be just a dream, but the Ukrainians are doing the best the reality allows them to do. The bulk of the Ukrainian Marine Corps has been concentrated along the Dnipro and is leading the amphibious actions. The Ukrainians have three stable &quot;bridgeheads&quot; (infantry&#39;s bridgeheads, supplied by small boats) across the Dnipro: under the Antonovskiy road bridge, under the Antonovskiy railroad bridge, and in the area near Krynky. The latter is very important to highlight as the Ukrainians were able to occupy positions beyond the Konka River and not just beyond the Dnipro (the Konka is a parallel branch of the Dnipro; between the two rivers there are marshy islands that are generally no-man&#39;s land). The Ukrainians hold part of the settlement of Krynky and have cut the road from Korsuna to Kozachi Laheri. Despite their large numerical advantage, the poor road network is weighing heavily on the Russians&#39; abilities to counterattack (worsened by the fact that it appears that the bulk of the armored vehicles in the sector are wheeled ones). The &quot;Birds of Madyar&quot; drone unit (attached to the 59th Motorized Brigade, employed in the southern flank of Avdiivka) was moved to Kherson to support the actions of the marines. They slaughtered quite a lot of Russian BTR-82s around Krynky. The Russians in the Krynky area brought forward the 26th Motorized Regiment of the 70th Motorized Division and the newly-deployed 144th Motorized Brigade, both part of the new 18th Army (SMD), supported by a couple of Storm Z detachments. Ukrainian artillery would be reaping major losses in the Russian ranks. The 177th Naval Infantry Regiment was brought near the area of the railway bridge (from the Polohy sector), and in the same area there are the few elements of the 7th VDV Division not deployed in the Orikhiv sector (i.e. the 171st Separate Air Assault Battalion, the 162nd Recon Battalion, and the 104th Tank Battalion). They haven&#39;t recorded any success in dislodging the Ukrainians from under the bridge, however. The fact that the Russians are being forced to bring reinforcements to Kherson (where their grouping is already large) and they are suffering losses in the face of a limited UAF commitment, is certainly a win-win situation for Ukraine...</p>\n</div>",

Don't forget that the relationship position Vietnam recently upgraded with US, Russia and China enjoyed it way before USA. US is biggest trading partner of Vietnam, while China is second, but in term of agriculture products China is top spot. To see how depends Vietnam agriculture sector is, in the end of 2022, around Chinese new year ( that's feb-march in Julius calendar), due to pandemic, China closed the border with Vietnam, which effectively halted the Vietnam-China export. The results is over 5 thousands containers worth of agriculture products get stuck in the border checkpoints and bring tremendous losses to the farmers as these mainly are fruits and vegetables, which would degrade their quality rapidly if not delivered. Back during the HD981 oil drill in SCS, after the riots targeted at Chinese owned factories, China halted Vietnam pork exports due to \"safety concern\" which put the market into chaos. Right after, Vietnam president pay a visit to China, in one of discussions is about pork import. Similar thing happened in 2017. That's why there are plenty of discussions among Vietnamese experts and efforts by policymakers to diversify Vietnam agriculture export in markets outside of China to lessen the over reliance( like fruits export to Japan, Australia, Europe, US market). But it is easier said than done. Japanese love Vietnamese lychees, but they don't consume ( number wise) as much as the Chinese.That's not to mention other markets ( like EU) take much higher standard for Vietnam agriculture products, and many markets they set up tariffs to protect their own domestic agricultural sector. So maybe Vietnam can diversify tropical fruits export to, let say, Australia or Japan but beef, buffalo and pork meat, organ they can't export there since there's not many demand. To put it more simple, China is the traditional and very important trading partner of Vietnam, so there will not be \"steering away\" in foreseen future.\n\n\nSecondly, in geographically wise, Vietnam depends a lot on China. The Mekong river that provide water for the southern Vietnam river delta, the biggest bread basket, and the red river, provides water to northern Vietnam river delta, the second biggest breadbasket all originated from China. If Vietnam don't play diplomacy wisely China can use that as a card like Russia using their energy export against EU. Id say it's even more important than Russian's because with LNG, even if EU don't buy Russian gas, they can divert to other suppliers but well, you can't dig another river right? As climate change becomes more and more severe, agriculture production and food security will become an important challenge for countries around the world. India stopped exporting some type of rice already, people talking about Iran geopolitical issues with USA but don't talking much about iran looming water problem. Vietnam, as one of biggest rice exporters in the world( which rely heavily on water irrigation for rice planting), restricting these rivers would cause tremendous harm if Vietnam turn to China rival. That's not to mention Vietnam is relying a lot on hydroelectric. Although it only contributed to around 20% of nation wide power source but in northern Vietnam ( where the capital and many foreign factories operate by the way) rely around 60% from this source. As evidence this summer Vietnam faced a drought that put the river systems in the north to critical level, unable to produce electricity and caused many damage to the industrial, service sector. If Vietnam join military alliance, China water restrictions would not only cause damage to the agriculture but manufacturing industry as well. \n\n\nVietnam diplomacy is still play both side between US lead bloc and China and gain benefit from both, although the line is becoming thinner as US-China tension rise. The recent news about US-Vietnam diplomacy is more like US is trying very hard to pull Vietnam to its side( from 2022 till now, Secretary of state, VP then president visit ). US also asking its junior allies in asia who has better relationships with Vietnam go first to \"clear the path\", like Japanese PM, Australian PM, SK president. Vietnam economy also need a new FDI injection to boost the economy that is in a difficult situation because of covid and current on going war.

The IDF does not have the same affinity with Palestinian civilians that Iraqi forces did with the compatriots they were liberating from ISIS rule.\n6. Poorer human intelligence than the Iraqis.

But I agree, Israel probably feels they can&#39;t waste time because 1) public opinion in the West is bound to turn and 2) the longer this goes on, the larger the chance this escalates into a &quot;real&quot; war with Israel&#39;s neighbors. </p>\n\n<p>I also get the feeling they are very casualty-averse for a country which claims its existence is threatened, which I guess is because 1) the IDF in the end can only draw from a relatively small population and 2) maybe for some reason there is no real support for a drawn out war among Israelis (no idea, just speculating). </p>\n\n<p>These two factors might explain the intense bombing campaign: sure there may be significant &quot;collateral damage&quot; (another grim euphemism that people like to use) when quickly bombing anything that may or may not have a Hamas militant in it, but at least you&#39;re getting some of them while risking none of your own guys.

The drone moves independently, meaning that you can maintain observation over a location or area while the tank repositions. Further, if a friendly tank has an issue with their drone, you can read task another drone from the platoon. You can't do that as easily with a mast. \n\n2. The drone can obtain a much better altitude than a mast, meaning better visibility of the ground past obstacles that would obstruct the vision of a mast (like tall buildings). To me this difference isn't just the height, but is also about the angle of view generated. \n\n\n> It might be a good idea, but there are some issues, like what the British found with the Streetfighter variant of Challenger 2, the tankers become overly cautious and checking every possible enemy position before moving slows down the advance to a crawl.\n\n\nYeah, that sounds like a nightmare. I get your reasons for wanting to keep it at the company or platoon level, but I still think that there are benefits to having it on an individual tank (like interoperability if a command tank is knocked out).",

It's a World War I massively-multiplayer top-down shooter where literally everything from rifle ammo to tanks is player-produced. You've got people on the front digging trenches, setting up defenses, FOBs, etc., others doing recon and partisan activity behind the frontlines, and others still in \"home base\" who are responsible for producing whatever's needed at the front and ensuring it gets to where it's most needed. The map is huge, with sometimes as many as thousands of players online at the same time, and a single war can last for weeks or even months (I'm talking real-world time). I've never played production/logistics since I'm still relatively new and that part of the game is apparently pretty complicated, but, to my knowledge, yeah, it obviously doesn't take as long to build or manufacture something as it does in real life, but it can still take a while. As with any game, there has to be some suspension of disbelief, but still, Foxhole is unique in that it's \"realistic\" and the scale of it is enormous. And again, while production is \"gamified,\" logistics is the key, make-or-break thing. You have players protecting rail lines against sabotage, loading up the trains and getting them to the front, and then there's the logistics trucks running from production facilities to the front basically non-stop. While this isn't for everyone, there's always more than enough players who enjoy doing that sort of thing, so if you wanna be a front-line grunt, go for it; if you wanna drive trucks full of supplies, you can do that as well; and if you want to make sure your side has more arty and tanks than the other guys, home base is for you.",
