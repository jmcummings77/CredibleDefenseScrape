One, I strongly supported and still support Biden's decision to leave. Afghanistan does not have Korea's favorable geography; it's a landlocked country that has two long and leaky \"borders\" with Pakistan and Tajikistan. So we could never achieve in Afghanistan the type of sustainable stalemate we have in Korea; anytime things go south for the Taliban, they'd just cross over into Pakistan, bide their time, and then cross back to fight another day. Staying in such a country indefinitely with no plan to ever permanently defeat the Taliban would have been futile.\n\nTwo, we weren't in Afghanistan as a \"hegemonic power.\" We were originally in Afghanistan to get then al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for 9/11. It had nothing to do with the Taliban *per se*. I remember last year as Afghanistan was falling apart (this very time in August 2021), people who were calling for us to stay indefinitely kept talking about women's rights, democratization, this and that **with one exception**: almost nobody was saying anything about al-Qaeda anymore. So our presence in Afghanistan over 20 years had undergone massive, massive mission creep. We didn't even know why we were there anymore, and you admit as much insofar as you say that we \"had no story to tell.\"\n\nAgain, when that's the situation, the proper response is not to fabricate a new story to tell to justify staying; the proper response is to do what Biden did: proceed with the withdrawal.\n\n> Near future?

A nation of 25 million sitting on top of 3 million square miles should always be on guard.\n>\n> Invasion isn't what Australia has to worry about though.\n\nAs I've said before, as a proponent of restraint in US foreign policy, I enthusiastically support Australia becoming more self-reliant for its own national defense and relying less on us as the quote, unquote \"hegemonic power.\"",

We didn&#39;t even know why we were there anymore, and you admit as much insofar as you say that we &quot;had no story to tell.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Again, when that&#39;s the situation, the proper response is not to fabricate a new story to tell to justify staying; the proper response is to do what Biden did: proceed with the withdrawal.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Near future? No. Distant future? I wouldn&#39;t rate it as likely, but it is certainly a possibility. I doubt Iraq would have predicted being invaded by America in 1980. A nation of 25 million sitting on top of 3 million square miles should always be on guard.</p>\n\n<p>Invasion isn&#39;t what Australia has to worry about though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I&#39;ve said before, as a proponent of restraint in US foreign policy, I enthusiastically support Australia becoming more self-reliant for its own national defense and relying less on us as the quote, unquote &quot;hegemonic power.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "*Did Russia mess up its cyberwar with Ukraine before it even invaded? Ukrainian officials say Russia jumped the gun in cyberspace*\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/04/did-russia-mess-up-its-cyberwar-with-ukraine-before-it-even-invaded/\n\nJan. 14 was a rough day for the Ukrainian government: Destructive malware wiped out computers at two agencies, and hackers temporarily took down dozens of agency websites and left a message on the Foreign Ministry site to \u201cBe afraid and expect the worst.\u201d\n\nNow, though, Ukrainian officials say that the assault was a huge miscalculation on the Russians\u2019 part. They actually undermined potential future digital sabotage campaigns by exposing the covert access they had gained, and the incident made it easier for Ukraine to recover from attacks once an invasion began in earnest one month later, the officials say.\n\n\u201cThey could have waited for the beginning of the war and if it had happened it would have been a disaster,\u201d said Victor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s main cybersecurity agency, the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection.\n\nZhora spoke to my colleague Ellen Nakashima and myself in a pair of recent interviews. Illia Vitiuk, who heads the state security service\u2019s cybersecurity department, also spoke to Ellen.\n\nTheir accounts could shed some light on the mystery of why Russia hasn\u2019t overwhelmed Ukraine in cyberspace, although independent experts differ on the plausibility of the Ukrainian claims. And the Ukrainian officials didn\u2019t attribute the minimal Russian cyber operations to the mistakes of Jan. 14 alone, citing outside defensive help, among other factors. \n\nZhora said Russian hackers had access on Jan. 14 to Kitsoft, an IT vendor that has developed websites for the Ukrainian government. (Kitsoft has said not all the hacked sites ran its software.) \u201cIt\u2019s really fantastic access they got and they burned it,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia-based, government-affiliated hacking groups shared their digital access with military intelligence, Vitiuk said \u2014 an unusual situation. \u201cThey combined everything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey burned all their accesses,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, they started to achieve new ones and burned those as well.\u201d\n\nHe explained that now the Russians are constantly working \u201coff the cuff,\u201d which, he said, makes it difficult to regain access without having time to prepare and with the Ukrainians having raised their defenses.\n\n\u201cThe hacks gave us some lessons in terms of how to respond, how to coordinate,\u201d Zhora said. \u201cSo it was a good exercise for us.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s thinking\nBoth officials could only speculate why Russia did what it did on Jan. 14. Zhora said it amounted to a \u201cpsyops\u201d mission targeting the Ukrainian public in an attempt to sway Ukrainians into thinking that Russia was too strong.\n\n\u201cSo the idea was to indicate that, \u2018We have great power. We can do anything in cyber, battlefield, whatever,\u2019 \u201d Zhora said. Russia underestimated the kind of fight Ukraine would put up, instead expecting an easy invasion, so there was no need to hold anything in reserve, Zhora and Vitiuk said. U.S. intelligence officials have likewise concluded that Russia anticipated less resistance.\n\nThose Jan. 14 missteps have had a lasting impact on Russia\u2019s cyber operations, the pair said. When Ukraine\u2019s \u201cIT Army\u201d (a group of hackers the Ukraine government says it has no connection to) took down Russian YouTube clone RuTube for three days in May, Russia didn\u2019t retaliate.\n\n\u201cIf they had accesses, something in their pockets, aces in their sleeves, once RuTube was embarrassing for them, they should have a response, like, \u2018Don\u2019t do that again,\u2019 \u201d Vitiuk said. \u201cBut there were no responses from them, there were no significant cyberattacks after this \u2026 So probably if they could do something they would. So they have nothing ready for now.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><em>Did Russia mess up its cyberwar with Ukraine before it even invaded? Ukrainian officials say Russia jumped the gun in cyberspace</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/04/did-russia-mess-up-its-cyberwar-with-ukraine-before-it-even-invaded/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/04/did-russia-mess-up-its-cyberwar-with-ukraine-before-it-even-invaded/</a></p>\n\n<p>Jan. 14 was a rough day for the Ukrainian government: Destructive malware wiped out computers at two agencies, and hackers temporarily took down dozens of agency websites and left a message on the Foreign Ministry site to \u201cBe afraid and expect the worst.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Now, though, Ukrainian officials say that the assault was a huge miscalculation on the Russians\u2019 part. They actually undermined potential future digital sabotage campaigns by exposing the covert access they had gained, and the incident made it easier for Ukraine to recover from attacks once an invasion began in earnest one month later, the officials say.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey could have waited for the beginning of the war and if it had happened it would have been a disaster,\u201d said Victor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s main cybersecurity agency, the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection.</p>\n\n<p>Zhora spoke to my colleague Ellen Nakashima and myself in a pair of recent interviews. Illia Vitiuk, who heads the state security service\u2019s cybersecurity department, also spoke to Ellen.</p>\n\n<p>Their accounts could shed some light on the mystery of why Russia hasn\u2019t overwhelmed Ukraine in cyberspace, although independent experts differ on the plausibility of the Ukrainian claims. And the Ukrainian officials didn\u2019t attribute the minimal Russian cyber operations to the mistakes of Jan. 14 alone, citing outside defensive help, among other factors. </p>\n\n<p>Zhora said Russian hackers had access on Jan. 14 to Kitsoft, an IT vendor that has developed websites for the Ukrainian government. (Kitsoft has said not all the hacked sites ran its software.) \u201cIt\u2019s really fantastic access they got and they burned it,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Russia-based, government-affiliated hacking groups shared their digital access with military intelligence, Vitiuk said \u2014 an unusual situation. \u201cThey combined everything,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey burned all their accesses,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, they started to achieve new ones and burned those as well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He explained that now the Russians are constantly working \u201coff the cuff,\u201d which, he said, makes it difficult to regain access without having time to prepare and with the Ukrainians having raised their defenses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe hacks gave us some lessons in terms of how to respond, how to coordinate,\u201d Zhora said. \u201cSo it was a good exercise for us.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s thinking\nBoth officials could only speculate why Russia did what it did on Jan. 14. Zhora said it amounted to a \u201cpsyops\u201d mission targeting the Ukrainian public in an attempt to sway Ukrainians into thinking that Russia was too strong.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo the idea was to indicate that, \u2018We have great power. We can do anything in cyber, battlefield, whatever,\u2019 \u201d Zhora said. Russia underestimated the kind of fight Ukraine would put up, instead expecting an easy invasion, so there was no need to hold anything in reserve, Zhora and Vitiuk said. U.S. intelligence officials have likewise concluded that Russia anticipated less resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Those Jan. 14 missteps have had a lasting impact on Russia\u2019s cyber operations, the pair said. When Ukraine\u2019s \u201cIT Army\u201d (a group of hackers the Ukraine government says it has no connection to) took down Russian YouTube clone RuTube for three days in May, Russia didn\u2019t retaliate.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf they had accesses, something in their pockets, aces in their sleeves, once RuTube was embarrassing for them, they should have a response, like, \u2018Don\u2019t do that again,\u2019 \u201d Vitiuk said. \u201cBut there were no responses from them, there were no significant cyberattacks after this \u2026 So probably if they could do something they would. So they have nothing ready for now. That\u2019s how I see it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine should rest easy in cyberspace, Vitiuk said.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how the situation may change in a year, two years, five years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have to be aware and prepared. Saying, \u2018Oh Russia, they cannot do anything\u2019 \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t be wise.

Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine.\nThe remains of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard members were recently recovered in Khan Tuman, a village 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) south of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city that was for years the war\u2019s most important front line.\n\nThe Guard identified the five deceased fighters, providing few details about their deaths with the exception of Gen. Abdollah Eskandari \u2014 a decorated commander who became known as the \u201cheadless general\u201d after his capture and beheading by Syrian rebels in May 2014. Their bodies were repatriated after a lengthy process of recovery and DNA analysis.\n\nIran has increasingly admitted casualties since it intervened to rescue Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s government, a ground presence that coincided with Russia\u2019s air campaign and helped Assad recover control over most of the country. Although Iran has only acknowledged its forces as having an advisory role, dozens of Iranian soldiers have been killed fighting the Islamic State group and other extremists in Syria.\n\nFuneral marches snaked through cities across the country this week, beginning Monday in the northeastern city of Mashhad before moving south, returning each officer\u2019s body to his birthplace for burial.\n\nThe thousands that gathered in Tehran\u2019s streets on Thursday evening waved red flags to mark Ashoura, a commemoration of the 7th century death of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson Hussein, a revered figure in Shiite Islam. Chants of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d rang out from the crowds.\n\nIn a speech, Guard commander Gen. Hossein Salami hailed the return of the fighters\u2019 remains and the survival of Assad\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the (Assad\u2019s) system to remain but the U.S., Europe and the Arab world did not want it. Now see who remains in the country,\u201d Salami declared.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s Intelligence Ministry said authorities arrested 10 suspects with links to the Islamic State group who had planned attacks at various locations across Iran during Ashoura rallies planned next week. Two agents were wounded in shootouts with suspected militants in the country\u2019s south and west, the ministry added.\n\nIran\u2019s Shiites revere the dead, especially their martyrs killed in battle, so the funerals for the Guard officers present a way to gauge public opinion and rally support for the theocracy at a time of political and economic crisis.\n\nTalks to revive Iran\u2019s tattered 2015 nuclear deal with world powers resumed Thursday in Vienna after a monthslong deadlock, apparently a last-ditch effort to save the diplomatic process from collapse. Prospects for a breakthrough have darkened as Iran rapidly advances its nuclear work under diminishing international oversight and political opposition to the deal rises in Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s economy is staggering under heavy sanctions four years after former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the landmark accord, which granted Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for strict curbs on its atomic program.\n\nAs inflation surges to new heights and desperation grows over deteriorating living conditions, Iranian hard-liners have sought to reinforce the national ideology. Earlier this spring, authorities organized performances for a new pop song called \u201cHello Commander!\u201d and school children across the country saluted Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
