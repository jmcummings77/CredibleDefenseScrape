For Ivan, 43, an old-timer from Ukraine\u2019s 103rd brigade, the fighting inside Russia was just another day\u2019s work. \u201cGrenades and mortars look the same wherever you are.\u201d The newest recruits were almost paralysed with fear. But the men tramped on together, 10km a day, crossing fields and railway lines, every night replacing forward units in hastily dug positions ahead of them. Three days, three hikes, three rotations. On the third night, the Russian glide bombs hit. \u201cEverything was burning. Arms here, legs there\u201d. Twelve men in the company died immediately. Ivan suffered shrapnel injuries to his groin and chest, and was evacuated to a hospital in the Sumy region of Ukraine.\n\n> Ukraine\u2019s six-day-long operation inside Russia has progressed faster than many dared believe. A Ukrainian security source says that by Saturday August 10th, some units had moved a full 40km inside Russia towards the regional capital of Kursk. The attack, shrouded in secrecy, caught the Kremlin off-guard. Some 76,000 locals have fled and the Russian authorities have declared a state of emergency there. The absence of a well-organised evacuation has angered many. Vladimir Putin called it a large-scale \u201cprovocation\u201d. Volodymyr Artiukh, the head of Ukraine\u2019s military administration in Sumy, says the Ukrainian success represented a \u201ccold shower\u201d for the Russians. \u201cThey are feeling what we have been feeling for years, since 2014. This is a historical event.\u201d\n\n> But the accounts from Ukraine\u2019s wounded suggest it has not been a walk in the park, and remains risky. The hospital ward reeks of the sacrifice: soil, blood, and stale sweat. Foil burn-dressings line the corridor. In the yard, the patients, some wrapped like mummies from head to toe in bandages, smoke furiously. Angol, a 28-year-old paratrooper with the 33rd brigade, looks like a Christmas tree. His left arm is immobilised in a fixation device. Tubes, bags and wires protrude from his body. He was also about 30km into Russia when his luck ran out. He isn\u2019t sure if it was artillery or a bomb that hit him. Maybe it was friendly fire; there was a lot of that. All he can remember is falling to the ground and shouting \u201c300\u201d, the code for wounded. The Russians had been on the run up to then, he insists, abandoning equipment and ammunition as fast as they could.\n\n> Other soldiers in the yard recall the demonic buzz of Russia\u2019s skies. Ukraine has deployed a lot of air-defence and electronic-warfare assets to the area, but drones and aviation find ways through. Mykola, an infantryman who says he was in the first group to cross over into Russia, says pilots attacked as soon as they entered the first Russian village. At a second village, the group was targeted by helicopters. Mykola recalls throwing himself to the ground, and then the sound of a helicopter crashing, downed by a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile. But close calls have consequences. The problem with throwing yourself to the ground at night is you can\u2019t see where you\u2019re falling, Mykola says. He broke a rib and had to be evacuated.\n\n> Some aspects of Ukraine\u2019s operation appear to have been meticulously planned. Operational security delivered the element of surprise, a crucial aspect of warfare. \u201cWe sent our most combat-ready units to the weakest point on their border,\u201d says a general-staff source deployed to the region. \u201cConscript soldiers faced paratroopers and simply surrendered.\u201d But other aspects of the operation indicate a certain haste in preparation. All three soldiers quoted in this article were pulled, unrested, from under-pressure front lines in the east with barely a day\u2019s notice.\n\n> The end goal of Ukraine\u2019s operation still remains unclear: does it aim to push further, towards the city of Kursk? Is the plan to occupy part of the territory permanently, perhaps as a bargaining chip in negotiations, or does it intend to withdraw after causing Vladimir Putin maximum embarrassment? Ukraine does not appear to be reinforcing its positions in any serious sense. \u201cOur calf demands a wolf,\u201d the security source cautions, using a local saying to warn against overly ambitious objectives.\n\n> A minimum objective appears to be pulling troops away from Russia\u2019s stranglehold in Kharkiv and Donbas, the main focuses of the war. On early evidence, the results are inconclusive. Russia has shifted troops from the Kharkiv front, but so far it has moved far fewer from the vital Donbas front. \u201cTheir commanders aren\u2019t idiots,\u201d says the Ukrainian general-staff source. \u201cThey are moving forces, but not as quickly as we would like. They know we can\u2019t extend logistics 80 or 100 km.\u201d\n\n> The source cautions against comparing the Kursk incursion to Ukraine\u2019s successful swift recapture of much of Kharkiv province in late 2022. The Russian army is taking the war more seriously now, he says: \u201cThe danger is we\u2019ll fall into a trap, and Russia will grind our teeth down.\u201d On Sunday Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed, albeit not for the first time, that it had \u201cthwarted\u201d attempts by Ukrainian forces to break deeper into Russia.\n\n> The mathematics of war have never favoured Ukraine, which must husband its limited resources, and an assault deep inside undefended Russian territory risks making the situation worse. But the operation has already improved the one crucial intangible\u2014morale\u2014that has allowed Ukraine to cheat the odds for nearly three years now. Whether in government offices in Kyiv, or in front-line hospitals treating the wounded, the nation believes it has uncovered a vulnerability in Vladimir Putin\u2019s armour. Tired, dirty and exhausted, the soldiers say they regret no part of the risky operation that has already killed scores of their comrades: they would rejoin it in a heartbeat. \u201cFor the first time in a long time we have movement,\u201d says Angol. \u201cI felt like a tiger.\u201d \u25a0\n\n***I want to highlight the following from it:***\n\n> But other aspects of the operation indicate a certain haste in preparation. All three soldiers quoted in this article were pulled, unrested, from under-pressure front lines in the east with barely a day\u2019s notice.\n\n> A minimum objective appears to be pulling troops away from Russia\u2019s stranglehold in Kharkiv and Donbas, the main focuses of the war. On early evidence, the results are inconclusive. Russia has shifted troops from the Kharkiv front, but so far it has moved far fewer from the vital Donbas front.\n\nHere are two more commentaries:\n\nEmil Kastehelmi @emilkastehelmi - https://x.com/emilkastehelmi/status/1822674863636496684 \n\n> Regardless of whether the Ukrainians continue their advance, **they have proved that occupation of relatively large areas is no longer a privilege of Russia.** The war is now even more concretely a war on Russian soil as well, and Russia must take this into account in many ways. 18/\n\nMick Ryan, AM @WarintheFuture - https://x.com/WarintheFuture/status/1822827244492104115\n\n> 14/ The third option for #Ukraine would be to fully withdraw back to the international border between #Russia and #Ukraine. This would permit Ukraine to maximise the political and strategic benefits of operation into Russia while preserving a large body of experienced combat troops that might be employed on subsequent offensive operations in 2024 and 2025.\n\n> 15/ **By choosing this option the Ukrainians would be messaging to the Russians that \u201cwe can invade and hurt your country if we choose, but we have no wish to occupy our neighbours\u201d.**  While the Ukrainian invasion may allow Putin to reinforce his point to Russians about the \u2018threat from NATO\u2019, he also appears weak because he was not able to punish those who conducted the operation in Kursk.\n\n> 16/ **The objective for this option would be to humilitate Putin,** preserve Ukrainian combat forces, while sending a strategic message to Ukraine\u2019s supporters that that can go on the offensive and do so in a manner which does pose an existential risk to the ground forces conducting the operation.\n\nSo in a nutshell, after a week of this operation all we know is that Ukraine itself has shuffled away valuable resources from Donbas to partake in the Kursk offensive while Russia has done the opposite. The disintegration of the Pokrovsk defensive line is accelerating and there is still no conclusive analysis or clearly stated military goal for the Kursk front.\n\nI'm genuinely struggling to see how is this not a Krynky v2 serving only as a PR campaign to paint a picture to the international public and \"boost morale\". You can see it from Ukraine aligned analysts themselves. The point is to humiliate Putin, like we are in a highschool, not to fulfill a military sound objective.\n\n\n#EDIT: Mods banned me, so won't be able to reply. Thank you for the replies anyway !",

For Ivan, 43, an old-timer from Ukraine\u2019s 103rd brigade, the fighting inside Russia was just another day\u2019s work. \u201cGrenades and mortars look the same wherever you are.\u201d The newest recruits were almost paralysed with fear. But the men tramped on together, 10km a day, crossing fields and railway lines, every night replacing forward units in hastily dug positions ahead of them. Three days, three hikes, three rotations. On the third night, the Russian glide bombs hit. \u201cEverything was burning. Arms here, legs there\u201d. Twelve men in the company died immediately. Ivan suffered shrapnel injuries to his groin and chest, and was evacuated to a hospital in the Sumy region of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s six-day-long operation inside Russia has progressed faster than many dared believe. A Ukrainian security source says that by Saturday August 10th, some units had moved a full 40km inside Russia towards the regional capital of Kursk. The attack, shrouded in secrecy, caught the Kremlin off-guard. Some 76,000 locals have fled and the Russian authorities have declared a state of emergency there. The absence of a well-organised evacuation has angered many. Vladimir Putin called it a large-scale \u201cprovocation\u201d.

On top of significant and rapid (and still continuing) territorial gains by Ukrainian forces, they've inflicted heavy losses on Russian forces, likely at a pretty favorable ratio considering that the Ukrainians are on the offensive. The Ukrainians are also fortifying the territory they've captured, which will make any Russian efforts to reclaim it extremely costly. \n\nSo far it appears that Russia's plan is to use territorial defense, Akhmat, and conscripts to form the bulk of their forces in Kursk (in addition to local police, OMON, and other internal security forces), while supplementing them with better units including VDV, Naval Infantry, and mechanized/armored units. This will eventually be enough to prevent further Ukrainian advances, but will struggle to actually capture territory. On top of that, Russia will either need to use their typical doctrine of flattening Ukrainian held territory to make advances (which isn't great when it's Russian land their annihilating) or they'll need to reduce fires which will be more costly in men and equipment. \n\nEither way, the Ukrainian operation has already been quite successful in a number of ways, imposing dilemmas on Russian decisionmakers, and it hasn't even culminated yet.

That's a list of internal territorial divisions, without any notion of where their borders are. That is settled through separate legislation. In this case, it would be settled through border demarcation treaties or explicitly delineated in ascension treaties. No such treaties have been signed yet, and the ascension treaties literally say that the border of these oblasts is where the border was on the day of ascension (edit: in case it's not clear, they don't say anything useful on this subject, since no delineation that would be recognized by Russian legislation was binding at the time).

But that is not how the Russian (and, before it, the Soviet) legislation worked historically. For example, Soviet legislation once listed a Moldavian ASSR as an autonomous subject, whose territory spanned only a minuscule part of historical Moldova (in fact, most of it was not historical Moldovan territory), after a Soviet-sponsored uprising (a la DLP/LPR) failed to create a breakaway state.\n\nIt was primarily meant for diplomatic pressure and as an initial proving ground for the development of the Soviet Union's ethnic policy in the region. Even Soviet authorities treated it as a largely artificial construct, it was disbanded and broken down as soon as the Soviet Union managed to occupy the Moldovan territory it claimed (in 1940, before their quasi-alliance with Nazi Germany broke down).\n\n/u/Thendisnear17 isn't exaggerating when they say they can just change it back. Russia can claim to have liberated Kherson without actually holding an inch of the Kherson oblast's territory, they can just split a neighboring federal region, call it Kherson, and claim they've done it.
