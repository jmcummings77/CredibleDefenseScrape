As soon as nukes become useful everyone is going to want them, and they aren't terribly hard to make, as North Korea has shown.\n\nDeterrence works as long as the expected consequence of using nukes is that you get nuked, or otherwise fail whatever activity you were engaged in quickly and decisively.

And if they do use nukes in Ukraine, then the West will face a horrible choice. On the one hand they can ensure Russia loses the conflict, probably through conventional intervention in Ukraine, protecting the logic of deterrence but risking global nuclear war in the process.

And that's scary, because if Russia succeeds and anyone concludes that the reason Russia succeeded was because of the threat of nukes, even if no nukes are actually used, then everyone will want nukes or their own, so we still lose on nonproliferation. And soon enough, someone who isn't responsive to the logic of deterrence will get their hands on nukes.\n\nSo it's wildly irresponsible of Russia to have used nuclear rhetoric like this.

What happened? It's main rival, Pakistan, got nukes is 1998. Why? Because nobody wants to get nuked without being able to nuke back.\n\nNorth Korea got nukes in 2006. How have we prevented South Korea from going the Pakistan route? Probably by convincing them that our nukes are as useful as theirs. You'd have to be nuts to think South Korea's confidence wouldn't be shaken if Ukraine got nuked and the west dithered ineffectually.\n\nAnyway, probably Iran will have nukes by the end of the decade, both because Israel probably has them and because of the very examples you claim didn't inspire anyone to get nukes.\n\nSo the first problem with your argument is that nuclear weapons are already proliferating.\n\nThe second problem is that all the other countries that are holding off are doing so because (1) they trust the current security arrangements to mean that nobody will use nukes, and (2) they see themselves as having sufficiently powerful allies that their security can be guaranteed conventionally. Notice that Iran is getting nukes specifically because as a pariah state, they don't trust 2, and may not trust 1 either.

If it's \"just a state of mind\" then every other normative construct is also \"just a state of mind\", which definitely isn't true. As for your second point, the US policy of nuclear first use was clearly a part of deterrence theory, a necessary threat to prevent the Soviet Union from engaging in a first strike of their own. Even when nuclear use was considered during the Cold War, the threshold was not crossed. Why? Because of the nuclear taboo and the threat of punishment for breaking it. The US did not want to cross that line ever. Nuclear first use was considered mainly in the event of a full out war between NATO and the Soviet Union, when the entirety of Western Europe would have been under the direct threat of nuclear strikes and total destruction at the hands of a superior military force. The complete destruction and domination of the free world was considered worthy of nuclear first use. It also wasn't guaranteed. It's not clear whether the US itself would have gone nuclear in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe. After all, they may not have needed to start, considering that two other nuclear powers directly under existential threat in that situation (thus allowable under the nuclear taboo) would have probably launched first. That situation, by the way, is one that NATO never intended to initiate. It would only be in response to Soviet aggression.   \n\n\nYou are actively trying to compare that, a hypothetical defensive war for existence, to a real-life invasion and land grab gone wrong that doesn't threaten the existential existence of Russia. Ukraine is not marching on Moscow. Nobody is. Do you really truly believe that having to withdraw from Ukraine is of more vital interest to the **Russian Federation** (not just Vladimir Putin) than the complete destruction and domination of Western Europe would have been to the Cold War United States?

A very strong one. If it&#39;s &quot;just a state of mind&quot; then every other normative construct is also &quot;just a state of mind&quot;, which definitely isn&#39;t true. As for your second point, the US policy of nuclear first use was clearly a part of deterrence theory, a necessary threat to prevent the Soviet Union from engaging in a first strike of their own. Even when nuclear use was considered during the Cold War, the threshold was not crossed. Why? Because of the nuclear taboo and the threat of punishment for breaking it. The US did not want to cross that line ever. Nuclear first use was considered mainly in the event of a full out war between NATO and the Soviet Union, when the entirety of Western Europe would have been under the direct threat of nuclear strikes and total destruction at the hands of a superior military force. The complete destruction and domination of the free world was considered worthy of nuclear first use. It also wasn&#39;t guaranteed. It&#39;s not clear whether the US itself would have gone nuclear in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe. After all, they may not have needed to start, considering that two other nuclear powers directly under existential threat in that situation (thus allowable under the nuclear taboo) would have probably launched first. That situation, by the way, is one that NATO never intended to initiate. It would only be in response to Soviet aggression.   </p>\n\n<p>You are actively trying to compare that, a hypothetical defensive war for existence, to a real-life invasion and land grab gone wrong that doesn&#39;t threaten the existential existence of Russia. Ukraine is not marching on Moscow. Nobody is. Do you really truly believe that having to withdraw from Ukraine is of more vital interest to the <strong>Russian Federation</strong> (not just Vladimir Putin) than the complete destruction and domination of Western Europe would have been to the Cold War United States? I find that very hard to consider seriously.</p>\n</div>",

This is the equivalent of me saying to someone, \"I will shoot you if you invade my property with guns\" vs me going to my neighbor's backyard, saying it's my yard, and threatening to shoot him when he calls the police. Unless, of course, you believe the legitimacy of Russia's claims over Donbas, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson, and therefore accept the results of sham referendums for territories Russia does not even fully control.\n\nThere is no justification for Russia using nukes in this conflict. None. The only way you can accept it as justified is if you assume that Russian territory is immediately under threat from direct annexation or destruction by Ukraine, which is absurd in the extreme.

As far as I can tell, the tank in the picture from Ukraine does look identical to the T-90 Bhishma (the variant that India had sent to Russia for the T-90MS conversion). But it also looks similar to the T-90S that they exported to Vietnam, at least my eye can't tell the difference (I wouldn't know where to look)\n\nThe article that this one cited points to two details. First, the angle of the active countermeasure mortars is \"typical\" of the Bhishma. But across the T-90 pictures I've seen, the mortars point in all sorts of angles so I think the crews/mechanics might be able to attach them however they want. The second detail is that it also lacks the Shtora IR/designator countermeasures (the \"eyes\" you see on some T90), but I've seen pictures of T90S shipped with or without the Shtora (eg some exported to Vietnam had it, some didn't). Are there any 100% certain visual differences between the Bhishma and the other T-90S variants?",

As far as I can tell, the tank in the picture from Ukraine does look identical to the T-90 Bhishma (the variant that India had sent to Russia for the T-90MS conversion). But it also looks similar to the T-90S that they exported to Vietnam, at least my eye can&#39;t tell the difference (I wouldn&#39;t know where to look)</p>\n\n<p>The article that this one cited points to two details. First, the angle of the active countermeasure mortars is &quot;typical&quot; of the Bhishma. But across the T-90 pictures I&#39;ve seen, the mortars point in all sorts of angles so I think the crews/mechanics might be able to attach them however they want. The second detail is that it also lacks the Shtora IR/designator countermeasures (the &quot;eyes&quot; you see on some T90), but I&#39;ve seen pictures of T90S shipped with or without the Shtora (eg some exported to Vietnam had it, some didn&#39;t). Are there any 100% certain visual differences between the Bhishma and the other T-90S variants?</p>\n</div>",

It is certainly a punch in the face for Putin on his birthday. A couple of thoughts however in this short (for me) thread. 1/9\n\n>2/ First dropping a bridge span like this would take a lot of \u2018bang\u2019 (explosives) and good demolition design.

Local people had led the security service to the farm. Video and images provided to CNN by the security service show that soldiers had slept and eaten in the pig shed. \n\n>Lyubymivka was liberated earlier this week as Ukrainian forces pushed south through rural areas ok Kherson.\n\n>What CNN saw on the ground: CNN visited the village this week and found that a school house being used by the Russians had been hit. The CNN team also found that Russian soldiers had also been living in a children\u2019s recreational center.\n\n>The security service said that there were about 200 civilians left in the village when it fell. During the occupation, locals had been banned from being outdoors after 6 p.m. local time. It said Russian soldiers had taken food and alcohol from local people and had hidden their weaponry in residential areas so that it would not be detected by Ukrainian drones.\n\n>The security service also said that it had found stolen washing machines at the pig farm. \n\n\nAlso, there appears to be fighting going on south of Davydiv Brid?

Unless you are a designated marksman using a designated precision rifle, you're never going to be drawing a bead on someone 600 meters away.\n\nI can tell you from personal experience it doesn't actually take that much training to hit man sized targets at 500 yards even without magnified optics, even with 5.56. Modern rifles are really good, to the point where a 2 MOA rifle is \"junk\" to some people, but 2 MOA is a 12 inch circle at 600 yards which is plenty accurate for killing a person. So you don't even need to per se have a specialty marksman's rifle to hit at that range (actually I wouldn't be surprised if many DMRs currently in service were not even as accurate as mid-range commercial AR-15s). That said, yes in reality 99% of rounds will be shot at vague shapes in the distance because unlike torso targets, real people move and take cover when shot at. \n\nI think a better way to state your opening premise is \"Only a trained marksman with magnified optics is going to get a first shot hit on a target at 600m\" \n\nThe rest of your remarks I have no issue with",

That if you're clearing a building, you'll blow your way in with a rocket launcher rather than going through the door.

In reality, you shouldn't have to, use of the ground is the most important thing. \n\nA gunfight, is only one small part of the whole picture of close combat. The last piece really.  Maneuver matters, using the ground, preparing the ground. I think a lot of people look at Special Forces and think that those skills are needed by every line Infanteer. That you need to be a \"Sniper\" (Which is not an asset that should be employed below a Battalion), or that you need to be able to perform close quarters dynamic shooting (SWAT / Hostage Rescue style).\n\nAlso, I love my grandfather to death, but the man was a ***fudd (****His collection was probably worth 100k+ at his death)*, and president of the gun club. \"Here's a 1500 dollar pellet gun that's Olympic grade to learn on\" (My only, only ND ever was with that ***blanking blanking thing*** and it's hair trigger)(By the way, I hate glocks, and anything with any sort of fiddly-trigger, looking at you Enfield), or \"Semi automatics are bad, look at my 30 revolvers\".\n\nGreat skills, at 3-4 I was helping load ammo, by 8 I was shooting and casting revolver bullets (Good old printer's lead), by 14 I was helping  do repairs on rifles and build ammo with some great ballistic performance.  (.243 going at 4000fps, yes please.) - I had more range time in a week of summer than most people would have in 5 years of the army.\n\nModern shooting, is completely different. A new generation has taken over. A lot of the combat shooting skills that people train on are light years ahead of what was there, even 20 years ago.  They do get more and more realistic every year. Military ranges are just, different. I don't think any civilian range would have a butts party down to mark targets. When I shot in the 1990s-2000s, the old generation were still alive.

This is his baby, his big pet project, his black beret. He's the one pushing it, he's the most powerful uniformed service member, he's why this was approved.\n\nTo start off with, top brass in the Army (and Marines too) are generally CLUELESS when it comes to using small arms (tactics too). The last time any officer outside SOCOM is even issued a rifle is as a lieutenant colonel, and even then only when deployed to combat zones, and even then they don't really train beforehand like the rest. By the time they make 3-4 star they're about a decade and a half out of having even regularly touched rifles and nearly two decades from having done any real training with them or LMGs (which for officers typically ends at captain to major, or earlier). So recognize they aren't \"gun people,\" they don't follow trends, and they don't actually mess with any of this stuff after becoming a field grade, and even before that they don't really mess with it (officers in conventional units skip a lot of range training because they have more important things to do and firing weapons really isn't their job). \n\nSo their ignorance makes them incredibly susceptible to being manipulated, like by fear mongering defense industry sales reps, which is largely why this mess occurred. \n\nAfghanistan saw lots of long range engagements due to the ACM purposely avoiding ISAF small arms ranges by using GPMG, HMGs, RPGs, recoilless rifles, and the occasional sniper rifles. An enterprising sales rep for a VERY large firearms manufacturer that dominated global military sales created an \"overmatch\" focused PowerPoint slide show that made it's rounds through the Pentagon, which was designed to increase their own sales of 7.62 NATO battle rifles that weren't doing that well. That overmatch slide show was incredibly effective at emphasizing that most of every US Army rifle platoon member are dramatically outranged by 7.62x54R weaponry because of their measly 5.56 weaponry, which OMG the Russians and Chinese also have two x54R weapons in every squad! And since they're way better trained than the Taliban, they'll outrange us too and be even more effective than the Taliban! So that created the range overmatch necessity. \n\nBecause so many of these senior officers like to use scientific methods for problem solving, but don't really understand that either, those involved in ICSR and then NGSW used data to support the project. No shit, they did a statistical analysis of 82nd Airborne range qualifications scores out to 300 meters, found low percentages of 300 meter hits, and decided the likelihood of being able to score even a single hit at 300 meters and beyond was low. Since troops are taught to aim center mass, and since ballistic plates protects center mass, and since Russia and Chinese have plates, then small arm fire will be ineffective against Russian and Chinese troops. Especially at overmatch ranges, so the need to penetrate their plate armor is now beyond 300 meters. So that created the need to punch through NIJ Level 4 (just in case the Russians and Chinese upgrade) out to 600 meters (anything beyond that is considered sniper, mortar, or machine gun territory). \n\nThen there was a lust to use technology to fix training problems. Soldiers can't shoot for shit? Give them a very flat shooting cartridge and a computerized optic that does all the math, just like an M1 Abrams (which is exactly as they promoted that, nevermind that the M1 Abrams doesn't have to worry about shooting position, breathing, or trigger control to make a hit). \n\nLastly, there was a drive to replace the M4 since the early 2000s, when it caught a lot of bad press and criticism by very stupid by surprisingly influential retired generals like Robert Scales, who is a giant idiot who repeats gun store myths and creates really stupid suggestions (like making infantry something only 26 year olds and older on their second enlistment are allowed into), but he's respected and listened to by the current crop of US Army and Marine general officers, who are themselves so clueless that they don't realize he's full of shit. \n\nOverall there was a tiny bit of truth to everything but plenty of holes too. But you can't mention those holes while you're in the military, or in the defense industry, not when the idea comes direct from the most senior officer in the military, who will destroy you if you try to embarrass him and hurt his legacy project.",

Rerouting logistics. Tons of logistics will need to be rerouted, that's paperwork at minimum, possibly in an environment of environment. How long will this take? I'll give it a week.\n2. Russian coordination across the fronts is already bad. They will need to coordinate to deal with this.\n3. Ukrainians have gotten a gift horse in the mouth. Will they take it? Previous 8 months means...they probably will. Which means...\n4. Russian logistics, for some amount of time, will be entirely dependent on the land bridge. This will probably already be a problem given point number 1, however...there are 3 things that will be harassing Russia the whole time, \\*while\\* Ukraine puts pressure on points of the front at the same time (as we've seen throughout the war). **A.** Ukrainian artillery. Probably 75% of the problem the land bridge will have to face for whatever amount of time the bridge is out of action. B. Ukrainian special forces and Ukrainian partisans (likely both working together). They have both shown themselves to be fairly proficient in getting behind Russian lines, and doing damage.\n5. Kherson is extremely politically important to both countries and it is being *heavily* pressured right now. This blown bridge will give Ukraine even more options to up the temperature even more...at a time where the Kherson front is slowly receding for the Russians under the existing assaults.\n6. In general, because there'd be only one direction of supply for most of the south (the land bridge), this would also make the south, in general, even more difficult to defend for the amount of time the land bridge is the only supply route.\n7. The results of these factors will make Russia perform worse in the South than they already have been projected to. I don't see Kherson being in Russian hands in an optimistic scenario in 2 months time. Big blow to Russia, worsens political situation, which will affect the military considerations and what Russia decides to do thereafter.\n8. All of this will put extra pressure on the political situation in Russia, particularly the conscript situation. Depending on *just how badly things go* because of a blown bridge, even if it gets back up running, this could possibly expedite conscript training, at the expense of their performance in Ukraine once they arrive.\n9. If point 8 really does happen...this would lead to even more problems in Ukraine. Just Points 1-7 are bad enough.\n\n**TL;DR:** Yes, it's \"just\" a supply problem.

This is how 80\u201390% of action is fought \u2014 both by the Russians and Ukrainians. Should there be any doubts, invest 5\u201310 minutes of googling around to find articles quoting 80\u201390% of casualties on either side being caused by artillery.\n\n>Bottom line: most of the time, and regardless if on the move or standing still, everybody is hiding: hiding from UAVs, and from artillery.\n\n>Now, as a retired Lieutenant-Colonel of the US Marines nicely commented in a private chat, yesterday, this is where Ukrainians are enjoying quite some advantage. Reason? Whether motorised or airborne, the Russian infantry is \u2018vehicle tied\u2019. Its troops rarely venture more than 100 metres away from their vehicles. Because these vehicles are easy to detect and track \u2014 whether by radars, by infra-red or low-light TV systems \u2014 the Russian infantry is quite easy to find, too. On the contrary, Ukrainian infantry is frequently operating \u2018miles away\u2019 from its supporting vehicles. I.e. ZSU infantry is much harder to find.\n\n>So, where\u2019s then the tank\u2019s place in all of this?\n\n>Guess what: they\u2019re hidden. Scattered and hidden, to be more precise. Indeed: most of the time, and whenever within 10\u201315km from the frontline, they\u2019re just as well-hidden as anything else that wants to survive.\n\n>The reason is that tanks (and other armoured vehicles) are big, loud vehicles, raising dust whenever they move \u2014 and the human eye is made to detect movement first. Thus, whenever a tank moves, it\u2019s easy to detect. Especially so by any decent UAV, \u2018hovering\u2019 500\u20131,000 metres above \u2018its own side\u2019 of the frontline. Put two, three, six, ten or more tanks (or other armoured vehicles) together, and they\u2019re hard not to detect: \u2018even a blind man\u2019 \u2014 is going to hear them, at least. Even if organised into a column or a wide front, and well spread out, tanks are usually detected well before reaching the frontline: especially on the frontline as saturated with reconnaissance UAVs as those in Ukraine, and definitely well before they can bring their own weapons to bear.\n\n>Usual result is unavoidable: the mass of tanks that gets destroyed or disabled are destroyed or disabled by artillery while still some 2,000\u20135,000m behind the frontline. The only way to bring them any closer to the frontline is to first destroy enemy UAVs, or at least run counter-battery action and thus either suppress or force the other side\u2019s artillery to withdraw. To prevent the enemy from detecting tanks early, and then to prevent the enemy from targeting tanks by artillery. \u2026.alternatively, one can always drive them out \u2014 and then watch them being destroyed, one after the other.\n\nMy takeaway is that loss of foliage means hiding vehicles will be more difficult for both sides. This will at least somewhat disproportionately negatively impact the Russian forces as they're more \"vehicle bound\". \n\nWe are likely to see changes in camouflaging tactics to try to adapt, as well as vehicles staying further behind the frontlines most of the time to stay out of UAV spotting/artillery range since they can't hide as effectively.",

Thus, whenever a tank moves, it\u2019s easy to detect. Especially so by any decent UAV, \u2018hovering\u2019 500\u20131,000 metres above \u2018its own side\u2019 of the frontline. Put two, three, six, ten or more tanks (or other armoured vehicles) together, and they\u2019re hard not to detect: \u2018even a blind man\u2019 \u2014 is going to hear them, at least. Even if organised into a column or a wide front, and well spread out, tanks are usually detected well before reaching the frontline: especially on the frontline as saturated with reconnaissance UAVs as those in Ukraine, and definitely well before they can bring their own weapons to bear.</p>\n\n<p>Usual result is unavoidable: the mass of tanks that gets destroyed or disabled are destroyed or disabled by artillery while still some 2,000\u20135,000m behind the frontline. The only way to bring them any closer to the frontline is to first destroy enemy UAVs, or at least run counter-battery action and thus either suppress or force the other side\u2019s artillery to withdraw. To prevent the enemy from detecting tanks early, and then to prevent the enemy from targeting tanks by artillery. \u2026.alternatively, one can always drive them out \u2014 and then watch them being destroyed, one after the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My takeaway is that loss of foliage means hiding vehicles will be more difficult for both sides. This will at least somewhat disproportionately negatively impact the Russian forces as they&#39;re more &quot;vehicle bound&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>We are likely to see changes in camouflaging tactics to try to adapt, as well as vehicles staying further behind the frontlines most of the time to stay out of UAV spotting/artillery range since they can&#39;t hide as effectively.</p>\n</div>",

First, there were only 30 Gepards to be given to Ukraine, and only half arrived by mid August. And since artillery isn't supposed to be isolated and operating alone, they're supposed to be grouped in batteries relatively close to one another, ADA can better protect more than a single vehicle.

Considering the use of drones in this conflict, with many of those having thermal capabilities, I'd have thought at least one side in this war would have written a new chapter in military camouflage.

Which is weird because IFV aren't really any easier to hide and yet definitely need to be on the front line (considering nearly every UAF and RAF infantry squad has their own organic IFV). How can the IFV be near the front line, supporting their organic infantry dismounts, but tanks can't?\n\nDo these drones all have thermal camera? Other than parking AFV under very dense folliage, where is the evidence for other heat signature mitigation measures? Why haven't the UAF demanded thermal resistant camo netting now common with NATO AFV? Why aren't they using makeshift more than they are (which is rare in photos and videos? Are the samples too small? And if thermals aren't a threat, why aren't either side taking more advantage of low light operations? \n\nOverall, I think there is hide and seek happening against drones, but it doesn't seem to be very well done by either side, nor standardized.",

Put aside nuclear threats, weird diplomatic proposals from CEOs, and rumors of internal power struggles and try to look at the whole thing objectively. Yes, it has been a spectacular month or so for Ukraine. They have recaptured swathes of territory and now (presumably) have struck a significant blow to Russian pride and logistics. But on the battlefield, the war is still going and doesn't show any signs of stopping.\n\nEven the Ukrainians have admitted in recent days that the fighting Kherson is much harder than at other points in the war. According to on-the-ground sources, the Russians are withdrawing in an orderly fashion and making use of significant artillery support to cover their retreats. This is not appear to be a collapse ala Kharkiv from everything we can tell, a few alarmist Telegram rumors aside. Even per the United States' estimates, Ukraine is in for a hard slog in Kherson before the likelihood of them driving the Russians out of the city is even in the picture. It's tough but it's true. Similarly, the Ukrainians have had massive successes in Kharkiv and now pushing into Donetsk and Luhansk. That's good for them, but let's be honest here, Lyman was a challenge to crack and, as far as we know, the Russians did manage a withdrawal that included heavy equipment. Now the offensive in that direction seems to have slowed its pace in general. It does not appear to have culminated yet, but it's clear that the window of lightning fast advances seems to have closed for now. There is still *A LOT* of ground for Ukraine to recover to achieve its stated war aims, and that ground includes things that will be far tougher to crack than Lyman, or even Kherson.\n\nAs for Russia, yes, they are getting whooped in real time. There's no doubt about it, the situation militarily is bad. They've lost huge amounts of territory. They've suffered casualties and humiliation across the board. Even in Kherson, where they seem to be fighting well, they have still ceded a lot of ground. But mobilization is occurring. Yes, it may seem shoddy. Yes, it may not provide quality infantry. It will, however, provide an influx of manpower that cannot really be denied. The harsh truth here is that, despite all the rumors and posts of this or that issue, we can't accurately judge what the mobilized forces are going to look like. We have zero baseline. We can make assumptions based on the snapshots we are getting, but we cannot know for sure if this is going to be a force capable of at least holding a front line. It very well might be. Remember, this does not have to be a silver bullet for Russia. They just need to be able to hold onto territory and freeze the conflict to still get out of this with something they can hang on the rack as a victory.\n\nI know this is a bit of a downer post at a time when everything seems to be going Ukraine's way, but it's just the truth. Westerners in particular are inculcated with the idea that wars will be over and done with quickly, because in the biggest conflicts of the last thirty years with Western involvement, things ended quickly. That was the exception, not the rule, and it's important to recognize our bias in perception. We expect a crack, we expect a collapse, we expect a speedy resolution. But wars do not play to expectations. Wars in the main are quite long and costly and often have significant ebbs and flows. I am not comparing this current war to any other explicitly, but it is worth remembering that at one time or another the Kaiser's forces were knocking on the gates of Paris, the Germans were poised to take Britain, UN forces were surging across the 38th parallel, and Iraq was biting into Iran. At the start of this war, I think a lot of us held preconceived notions that it would be over quickly. Ukraine would collapse, Russia would take Kyiv, and this was a done deal. I feel like many of us still harbor that swift ending illusion, but the players have simply switched sides. Odds are there will not be a crack. There will not be a collapse. There will not be some rapturous moment when Ukrainians storm across the oblast and raise their flag over Donetsk as the Russians are running out the other side. If there is, well that's great for Ukraine. But don't expect it. Prepare for a lot of suffering. Prepare for a long war.",

And the Russian government has a response - we tried that in the 90's, and it was a disaster\n\nThat's giving too much credit to \"democracy\" in 90s Russia. There was no democracy there. The peoples of the USSR [voted to retain the Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_Union_referendum), and ironically the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic voted most against it despite having the most to gain by preserving the Union, but the coup attempt destroyed that. Then Yeltsin essentially moved for a power-grab (before his alcoholism had fully destroyed his brain) that was to destroy socialism and any kind of broader Union.\n\nThe people of the USSR didn't want capitalism as was forced upon them in the 90s. They wanted democracy. The Soviet hardliners that executed the August coup did not want either, and Yeltsin's faction said they wanted the latter but only promoted the former. Ironically, for the average person, the hardliners probably would have been better for them than Yeltsin, as with Yeltsin they got the horrors of the 90s, whereas with the hardliners they'd probably have ended up more similar to China - limited market liberalization in exchange for the continued power of the CPSU.",

Put simply, the following set of principles can\u2019t always be consistently held \u2014\n\n-\tCountries\u2019 borders should only be changed voluntarily and with the consent of all parties, and territorial gains made through aggressive means cannot be rewarded (territorial integrity).\n-\tThe citizens of a region have the right to decide which nation they belong to (national self-determination).\n-\tSettled residents of a region have the right to security of their person and property and cannot legitimately be expelled, forcibly transferred, or intimidated into leaving (no ethnic cleansing).\n\nThe three principles can come into conflict in lots of ways when dealing with bad actors, but here\u2019s a simple case: Country A is attacked by Country B, which illegally seizes Region X. Some years later, Country B is defeated by Country A, and Region X is returned to Country A. However, due to aggressive settlement of the region by Country B during the occupation, the majority of the residents of Region X now identify with Country B. How should we as Country A and the international community respond to this?\n\n-\tWe could recognise the principle of national self-determination and allow Region X to rejoin Country B via plebiscite, but this would in effect reward Country B\u2019s past aggression and undermine the principle of territorial integrity.\n-\tWe could ignore the wishes of the Residents of Region X and simply reincorporate them into Country A, but this would violate the principle of national self-determination.\n-\tWe could expel or \u201crepatriate\u201d the newer citizens of Region X back to Country B, but this would violate our commitment not to carry out ethnic cleansing.\n\nVarieties of this problem underlie so many complicated geopolitical debates around the world, from Israel to Nagorno-Karabakh and Northern Ireland and of course Ukraine. One party in effect uses illicit means to create \u201cnormative facts on the ground\u201d that other parties feel obliged to respect.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy answer here, I do think that we probably shouldn\u2019t regard the principle of national self-determination as absolute (a strict right) and more a desirable feature of political settlements that may not always be achievable given other constraints. I\u2019d note that we don\u2019t regard national self-determination as absolute in many other contexts; if one town in California want to joins Mexico, it can\u2019t just do so by holding a vote, and of course the North famously fought the South to prevent their secession.\n\nConsequently, I think in the toy example given, Region X shouldn\u2019t get to join Country B just because of self-determination. We should declare to them: \u201cyou have the right to continue to live on this land as free citizens of Country A. We understand that many of you identify with Country B instead. But that is only because of a past illegal occupation by Country B, and we will not allow borders to be changed in this manner.\u201d\n\nThe only circumstances in which I think national self-determination should become an overwhelming determinant in a political settlement is when it relates to the safety of a community. If the majority population of Region X was at significant risk of serious persecution if they were ruled by Country A again, that might count strongly in favour of Region X rejoining Country B or becoming independent. This might be because of ethnic or religious differences combined with an oppressive government. However, if Country A has a generally good government that respects rights, then I don\u2019t think that Region X automatically gets to decide which country it\u2019s a part of.",

                    "body": "As a footnote to the russia gonna nuke we must appease narrative.\n\nI get it that it is making people nervous and sorry for the description, but irrationaly afraid.\n\nI live quite near and honestly dont worry much about it. We (as humanity) had a big bunch of stupid nuclear tests already. Thanks to the bombs being bombs, designed to realese their energy at once, they dont continously add radiation to the environment (its still not a good think of course). So one nuke wouldnt really cause that much issues in radiation terms (I wouldnt want to be near to it  as in 100-200 miles ofc and probably start going the other way, depending on the wind)\n\nI am personally much, much more worried about the ZNPP. That can be a generational issue ... much more devastating and enduring then a nuke. That is something that should be paid attention to, cause its entirely possible that carelessnes/recklessnes/incompetence causes it from both side! As an accident. Given you need to be very unlucky to roll out a chernobyl 2.0 but you can do it.\n\nBack to the bombs. Russia only esured strategic change after using a nuke is devastating deafet in diplomatic, econimic, military and technological sense.\n\n- It would loose its most powerful backers, in an instant (China and India. I count india as a backer as it does not condem them outright, but it isnt a real backer, still big)\n\n- It would force the West/NATO to act immadietly. They would have the UN backing for it (since otherwise you show possible precedent against the nuclear tabu. It must be responded to, and it must be responded in full)\n\n- Their own domestic support would be threathened. Of course there will be a sizable warmongering fanatics, its russia, but everyone else that add to the gdp (engineers, doctors, businesses) would stop supportjng this.

We (as humanity) had a big bunch of stupid nuclear tests already. Thanks to the bombs being bombs, designed to realese their energy at once, they dont continously add radiation to the environment (its still not a good think of course). So one nuke wouldnt really cause that much issues in radiation terms (I wouldnt want to be near to it  as in 100-200 miles ofc and probably start going the other way, depending on the wind)</p>\n\n<p>I am personally much, much more worried about the ZNPP. That can be a generational issue ... much more devastating and enduring then a nuke. That is something that should be paid attention to, cause its entirely possible that carelessnes/recklessnes/incompetence causes it from both side! As an accident. Given you need to be very unlucky to roll out a chernobyl 2.0 but you can do it.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the bombs. Russia only esured strategic change after using a nuke is devastating deafet in diplomatic, econimic, military and technological sense.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It would loose its most powerful backers, in an instant (China and India. I count india as a backer as it does not condem them outright, but it isnt a real backer, still big)</p></li>\n<li><p>It would force the West/NATO to act immadietly. They would have the UN backing for it (since otherwise you show possible precedent against the nuclear tabu. It must be responded to, and it must be responded in full)</p></li>\n<li><p>Their own domestic support would be threathened. Of course there will be a sizable warmongering fanatics, its russia, but everyone else that add to the gdp (engineers, doctors, businesses) would stop supportjng this.

Look at how when Nancy visited Taiwan they put on a huge domestic show, bringing convoys of missles, tanks, excercises, launches etc. They had convoys of huge cruise missles going down the freeway, cruise missles that can travel thousands of miles, there is no military need to bring them close to the border near Taiwan, they can be launched anywhere. It was a domestic show.</p>\n\n<p>Thats a lot of effort just to impress the domestic audience. </p>\n\n<p>Also the reeducation camps, they put a lot of effort into taking the Uyghur muslims seperating them, re educating them and then spreading them out far from each other. They want everyone to be part of one big chinese group that drinks the governments kool aid together so that they can rise up over the US.</p>\n</div>",

In both perspectives we can see a load of \u201csparks\u201c fall down onto the road afterwards. If the explosion originated under the bridge the road would shield its surface from the blast. So any material being thrown up by an explosion below that makes it past the road would be on an outward trajectory. Yes it could be blown back in by strong enough winds and we can see those sparks influenced by wind to a degree but IMO it does not match up. Also, the head-on-view of the road does not support an explosion below the road at all\u2026looks more like it may even be slightly above (where the rail bridge is). Right after the screen goes all white the bright epicenter is at the top of the screen and not below.  Third: The \u201eboat\u201c spotted in the other footage is just a wave. In the full video you can see waves just like it still coming in after the explosion and at no point is any real boat/object clearly visible.\n\nExperts like Mick Ryan have also stated the amount of explosives necessary is really quite massive and would be delivered by bomb/missle. So a truckbomb makes sense but not the small marine UAV spotted earlier.\n\nWouldn\u2018t be surprised if this was some suicide bombing run. Maybe even by partisans. We know that a truckbomb / carbomb of devastating proportion is not beyond even local terrorism.\n\nIn any case, whatever it was, let\u2019s hope it has fucked Russian train logistics up real good. Fingers crossed.",

I don\u2019t think I have to explain why that\u2019s a dumb strategy in this conflict. </p>\n\n<p>You also don\u2019t understand the absolutely minuscule size of the Belorussian army and even that is counting the equivalent of SWAT as military. </p>\n\n<p>You have no idea how armies operate, the effect of attrition on command structures, or general military history. Your clearly get your understanding of Russian military capability from pop history documentaries and \u2018media\u2019. If you want to actually contribute I\u2019d recommend restarting at the basics.</p>\n</div>",

I'm sorry if you're finding the experience here is not up to the standard you want. We of the mod team are working very hard to keep the discussion as quality as possible, often at a detriment to our own well-being/mental, but it is obviously difficult to maintain a state of near perfection given that these daily threads are hitting 1k+ comments every day and we are only a small group of humans. I agree the discourse can be politically charged.
