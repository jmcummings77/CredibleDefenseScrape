        "body": "War on the Rocks' exclusive members only podcast with Michael Kofman, the Russia Contingency, recently posted a new episode that serves as a one year retrospective of the invasion. Kofman's intended goal of this podcast was to elaborate on what Russian experts expected before the conflict and to dispel some myths about what the public thinks that Russian experts expected before the conflict. \n\nSome key takeaways:\n\n* Kofman expected the Russian invasion to take place and was correct about the scope of the Russian plans, but he expected the Russians to make enveloping Ukrainian forces in the Donbas the focus of their plan with a diversionary force driving on Kyiv from Belarus. Instead it was actually an attempted decapitation strike, that foresaw only a few days worth of fighting before the Ukrainian government capitulated. Says the Russian forces only had supplies for about 10 days of active operations. \n\n* Kofman explains that Russians didn't obtain air superiority because they didn't think they would need to, it would've taken months (and they expected fighting to only last days), and that he doesn't think the VKS is actually capable of it. \n\n* Pushed back on the myth that Western officials expected Kyiv to fall within 3 days, he says that it was a worst case scenario especially if Russia killed, captured, or forced Zelensky to flee which didn't happen. \n\n* There are rumors Russian troops were told they didn't need to capture major cities because the FSB was going to flip political leaders and military officers instead. There's some evidence this was effective in the South where Russian drive from Crimea was largely unopposed and Kherson fell rapidly with little fight. \n\n* Russian military experts had little understanding of Ukrainian capabilities, Kofman says he called a lot of his contacts including people who trained the Ukrainians before 2022 to improve his understanding of their abilities and limitations. \n\n* There were never discussions of how the war would go if the West provided tons of equipment to Ukraine and the US provided active intelligence sharing instead of Ukraine solely fighting alone. These were hugely impactful unexpected pivots in policy.  \n\n* Kofman didn't anticipate the level of political interference in Russian planning, noting even high ranking Russian military was kept in the dark a long time, Russian units had their equipment deployed months earlier where they sat for a long time during the Winter causing maintenence issues, VDV not given enough time to plan the key mission to talk Hostomel, etc. Russians didn't fight according to the way they trained or their doctrine because of the totally unworkable strategic plan. \n\n* Russian military experts didn't consider enough the failings of Russian force design and how it would impact the war (partial mobilization force that didn't mobilize before the war, BTGs were lacking infantry, especially dismounts, to be able to occupy cities and conduct combined arms). \n\n* War was highly contingent, there have been many potential inflection points that could've gone either way (Kyiv was poorly defended, Western aid came just in time during Summer offensive, Kharkiv counterattack wildly successful, etc). \n\n* Kofman originally expected Russia to be successful in the kinetic phase after a month or two of fighting, but that they would fail during occupation. He's happy he was wrong, says you learn more from mistakes than what you get right. \n\n* Kofman thinks US fears of escalation held back aid somewhat early in the war, but it was mitigated by other factors like supply availability. Western militaries in general were hindered by French and German assessments that war was unlikely and Ukraine's steadfast denial that war was coming. \n\n* Early in the war analysts and some of the public suffered from military bias in favor of Russia, after Kharkiv offensive many flipped and became bias in favor of Ukraine. Neither is helpful, sover assessment of the facts is crucial to determining how things might go. \n\n* One of the biggest challenges is certain unknowns. Who expected Russia to ask Iran for military drones and SRBMs and for Iran to agree to it? What happens if China resolves Russian ammunition constraints and actively backs Russia militarily? Hard to predict scenarios that are hugely impactful to the outcome. \n\n* Pushed back on arguments that Russian/Ukrainian analysts were far off the mark and should do better in the future. He claims that the assumptions made regarding Russian military capabilities and effectiveness fighting against Ukraine were reasonable, it's just that circumstances were very different than could have been anticipated. If you had suggested in January 2022 that Russia's war would go poorly because they wouldn't fight based on their doctrine or training, that Russian political leadership would design invasion plans with little input from military officials, that the war would be a surprise to the Russia soldiers who were sent to fight in it, and that the West would do a 180 on military support and start providing active intelligence assessments, people would've called those predictions absurdly unrealistic. He thinks that analysts need to do a better job conveying uncertainty to the public though. He also says a lot of people want analysts to be better at measuring intangibles, but that's just not gonna happen. That's what makes them intangible.",

That team will likely have a minimum of two specialized roles if not three (team leader, light machine gunner, grenadier) and that leaves one extra body, typically the lowest ranking and most inexperienced member who can 1) act as a scout (walk point to trip mines and boobytraps or get shot first in an ambush) 2) Lug extra ammo and supplies 3) Serve as a replacement if one of the specialized weapon system users isn't available or becomes a casualty. Or in the case of the US Army, 4) Give them a designated marksman rifle requiring nearly a sniper's level of skill to know how to use properly. \n\nIn terms of skills, everyone in the infantry rifle squad is already supposed to be a trained rifleman before they then get trained on other weapon systems. One of the reasons that initial infantry training is lengthy (and getting lengthier) in western armies isn't because they're not motivated or work short days and don't work weekends, its because they have to be proficient at being a basic rifleman but also become proficient in all the other weapon systems in a rifle squad so they can immediate jump right into those positions when they get to their unit. On top of that they have to learn how to do every job day and night, offense and defense, patrolling, plus urban warfare. \n\nA 15 man platoon is pretty small, but Russian platoons were already small before the war started because they're all mech infantry, based on either 3x BMPs, BTRs, or BMDs. Total dismounts would only amount to about 18x pax, and that is just a bread and butter motor rifle platoon. But these platoons being discussed are task organized assault platoons, so they removed all the superfluous positions. \n\nAssuming their objectives are within the abilities, it could work. But the 3x man teams where everyone has a dedicated role is just asking for trouble, they don't allow for casualties. Lose a man, either lose the role or one man has to grab the guy's weapon and extra equipment and do more than one job.",

            "body": "There was a huge split among the population on the whole Maidan event, just as the pre-2014 presidential\\parliamentary elections results suggest - South and East were against it, while North and West mostly supported it. But being anti-Maidan didn't necessarily mean pro-Russia as much as being eurosceptic. I remember that anti-Maidan propaganda was mostly about pro-EU people not understanding the actual benefits of EU-UA Association Agreement, anti-Maidan folks thought that it was more beneficial to align with Russia economically and that the West wouldn't want us to begin with and this agreement was just a pipe dream. That's judging by my own experience. \n\nBut before 2014 I never heard anyone supporting separatism or joining Russia. You barely heard such ideas apart from Crimea maybe (I think even there it was marginal, but I don't want to speculate). There were early attempts to speculate on Donbass separatism during 2004 Maidan, but it was mostly laughed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Ukrainian_Autonomous_Republic\n\nIn 2014 after interim government lost Crimea, the newly elected government couldn't finish off separatists in Donbas and quality of life went down significantly half of the country who were anti-Maidan previously would obviously question whether it was worth it. Because of that, Russia's strategy of plausible deniability in Donbas and Crimea kinda worked, as even a lot of Ukrainians did not question that huge separatist movement suddenly appeared in the East out of nowhere, because they too were disappointed with the government (Nevertheless, they did not want to join Russia). So you would be surprised how many people blamed Maidan for \"starting it\", not Russia. \n\n2022 invasion on the other hand really opened everyone's eyes because of how straightforward Putin was with his words and actions. There's still this weird minority who are \"waiting\" for Russia to come in deep Ukrainian rear though. It was mostly Russian disinformation that does it to them.\n\nNot sure how credible this is, because I won't give you polls or infographics, just my own thoughts and experience as a russian-speaking Ukrainian. What I will give you, is 2019 parliamentary election results https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_parliamentary_election\nOPZZh is a disguised pro-Russian party and having 13% (without Crimea and a part of Donbas) vote for it was disappointing to be honest.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There was a huge split among the population on the whole Maidan event, just as the pre-2014 presidential\\parliamentary elections results suggest - South and East were against it, while North and West mostly supported it. But being anti-Maidan didn&#39;t necessarily mean pro-Russia as much as being eurosceptic. I remember that anti-Maidan propaganda was mostly about pro-EU people not understanding the actual benefits of EU-UA Association Agreement, anti-Maidan folks thought that it was more beneficial to align with Russia economically and that the West wouldn&#39;t want us to begin with and this agreement was just a pipe dream. That&#39;s judging by my own experience. </p>\n\n<p>But before 2014 I never heard anyone supporting separatism or joining Russia. You barely heard such ideas apart from Crimea maybe (I think even there it was marginal, but I don&#39;t want to speculate). There were early attempts to speculate on Donbass separatism during 2004 Maidan, but it was mostly laughed at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Ukrainian_Autonomous_Republic\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Ukrainian_Autonomous_Republic</a></p>\n\n<p>In 2014 after interim government lost Crimea, the newly elected government couldn&#39;t finish off separatists in Donbas and quality of life went down significantly half of the country who were anti-Maidan previously would obviously question whether it was worth it. Because of that, Russia&#39;s strategy of plausible deniability in Donbas and Crimea kinda worked, as even a lot of Ukrainians did not question that huge separatist movement suddenly appeared in the East out of nowhere, because they too were disappointed with the government (Nevertheless, they did not want to join Russia).

                    "body": "There's a ton of reason to think this. From Zbigniew Brzezinski's \"The Grand Chessboard\" written in *1997*:\n\n>The deliberately friendly posture adopted by the West, especially by the United States, toward the new Russian leadership was a source influence for \"westenizers\" in the Russian foreign policy establishment. It both reinforced its pro-American inclinations and seduced its membership personally. The new leaders were flattered to be on a first-name basis with the top policy makers of the world's only superpower, and they found it easy to deceive themselves into thinking that they, too, were the leaders of a superpower. When the Americans launched the slogan of \"the mature strategic partnership\" between Washington and Moscow, to the Russians it seemed as if a new democratic American-Russian condominium\u2014replacing the former contest\u2014had thus been sanctified.\n\n>That condominium would be global in scope. Russia thereby would not only be the legal successor to the former Soviet Union but the de facto partner in a global accommodation, based on genuine equality. As the new Russian leaders never tired of asserting, that meant not only that the rest of the world should recognize Russia as America's equal but that no global problem could be tackled or resolved without Russia's participation and/or permission. Although it was not openly stated, implicit in this illusion was also the notion that Central Europe would somehow remain, or might even choose to remain, a region of special political proximity to Russia. The \ndissolution of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon would not be followed by the gravitation of their former members either toward NATO or even only toward the EU.\n\n>The problem with this approach was that it was devoid of either international or domestic realism. While the concept of \"mature strategic partnership\" was flattering, it was also deceptive. America was neither inclined to share global power with Russia nor could it, even if it had wanted to do so. The new Russia was simply too weak, too devastated by three-quarters of a century of Communist rule, and too socially backward to be a real global partner. In Washington's view, Germany, Japan, and China were at least as important and influential. Moreover, on some of the central geostrategic issues of national interest to America\u2014in Europe, the Middle \nEast, and the Far East\u2014it was far from the case that American and Russian aspirations were the same. Once differences inevitably started to surface, the disproportion in political power, financial clout, technological innovation, and cultural appeal made the \"mature strategic partnership\" seem hollow\u2014and it struck an increasing number of Russians as deliberately designed to deceive Russia.\n\n>Perhaps that disappointment might have been averted if earlier on\u2014during the American-Russian honeymoon\u2014America had embraced the concept of NATO expansion and had at the same time offered Russia \"a deal it could not refuse,\" namely, a special cooperative relationship between Russia and NATO. Had America clearly and decisively embraced the idea of widening the alliance, with the stipulation that Russia should somehow be included in the process, perhaps Moscow's subsequent sense of disappointment with \"the mature partnership\" as well as the progressive weakening of the political position of the westernizers in the Kremlin might have been averted.\n\n>The moment to have done so was during the second half of 1993, right after Yeltsin's public endorsement in August of Poland's interest in joining the transatlantic alliance as being consistent with \"the interests of Russia.\" Instead, the Clinton administration, then still pursuing its \"Russia first\" policy, agonized for two more years, while the Kremlin changed its tune and became increasingly hostile to the emerging but indecisive signals of the American intention to widen NATO. By the time Washington decided, in 1996, to make NATO \nenlargement a central goal in America's policy of shaping a larger and more secure Euro-Atlantic community, the Russians had locked themselves into rigid opposition. Hence, the year 1993 might be viewed as the year of a missed historic opportunity. \n\n>Admittedly, not all of the Russian concerns regarding NATO expansion lacked legitimacy or were motivated by malevolent motives. Some opponents, to be sure, especially among the Russian military, partook of a Cold War mentality, viewing NATO expansion not as an integral part of Europe's own growth but rather as the advance toward Russia of an American-led and still hostile alliance. Some of the Russian foreign policy elite\u2014most of whom were actually former Soviet officials\u2014persisted in the long-standing geostrategic view that America had no place in Eurasia and that NATO expansion was largely driven by the American desire to increase its sphere of influence. Some of their opposition also derived from the hope that an unattached Central Europe would some day again revert to Moscow's sphere of geopolitical influence, once Russia had regained its health.\n\n>But many Russian democrats also feared that the expansion of NATO would mean that Russia would be left outside of Europe, ostracized politically, and considered unworthy of membership in the institutional framework of European civilization. Cultural insecurity compounded the political fears, making NATO expansion seem like the culmination of the long-standing Western policy designed to isolate Russia, leaving it alone in the world and vulnerable to its various enemies. Moreover, the Russian democrats simply could not \ngrasp the depth either of the Central Europeans' resentment over half a century of Moscow's domination or of their desire to be part of a larger Euro-Atlantic system.\n\n>On balance, it is probable that neither the disappointment nor the weakening of the Russian westernizers \ncould have been avoided. For one thing, the new Russian elite, quite divided within itself and with neither its \npresident nor its foreign minister capable of providing consistent geostrategic leadership, was not able to define \nclearly what the new Russia wanted in Europe, nor could it realistically assess the actual limitations of Russia's \nweakened condition. Moscow's politically embattled democrats could not bring themselves to state boldly that a \ndemocratic Russia does not oppose the enlargement of the transatlantic democratic community and that it wishes to be associated with it. The delusion of a shared global status with America made it difficult for the Moscow political elite to abandon the idea of a privileged geopolitical position for Russia, not only in the area of the former Soviet Union itself but even in regard to the former Central European satellite states.\n\n>These developments played into the hands of the nationalists, who by 1994 were beginning to recover their voices, and the militarists, who by then had become Yeltsin's critically important domestic supporters. Their increasingly shrill and occasionally threatening reactions to the aspirations of the Central Europeans merely intensified the determination of the former satellite states\u2014mindful of their only recently achieved liberation from Russian rule\u2014to gain the safe haven of NATO.\n\n>The post-Soviet Russian elite had apparently also expected that the West would aid in, or at least not impede, the restoration of a central Russian role in the post-Soviet space. They thus resented the West's willingness to help the newly independent post-Soviet states consolidate their separate political existence. Even while warning that a \"confrontation with the United States ... is an option that should be avoided,\" senior Russian analysts of American foreign policy argued (not altogether incorrectly) that the United States was seeking \"the reorganization of interstate relations in the whole of Eurasia ... whereby there was not one sole leading power on the continent but many medium, relatively stable, and moderately strong ones ... but necessarily inferior to the United States in their individual or even collective capabilities.\"\n\n>In this regard, Ukraine was critical. The growing American inclination, especially by 1994, to assign a high priority to American-Ukrainian relations and to help Ukraine sustain its new national freedom was viewed by many in Moscow\u2014even by its \"westerniz-ers\"\u2014as a policy directed at the vital Russian interest in eventually bringing Ukraine back into the common fold. That Ukraine will eventually somehow be \"reintegrated\" remains an article of faith among many members of the Russian political elite. As a result, Russia's Geopolitical and historical questioning of Ukraine's separate status collided head-on with the American view that an imperial Russia could not be a democratic Russia.\n\nBoth \"sides\" of this argument are partially correct.",

Not specifically addressed towards you.\n\n\n> I fail to see how you can talk about NATO expansionism and then reject Russian imperialism, despite them annexing territory.\n\nIn order to believe that it's base imperialism you need to:\n\n1.  ignore 3 decades of explicit, strongly worded russian state pronouncements regarding NATO.\n\n2. Ignore US diplomatic cables that restate the legitimacy of those pronouncements and confirm that it's a view that is shared throughout russian foreign policy circles. i.e. this is what they actually believe\n\n3. declare every speech putin has made since the invasion a lie, despite it aligning with his known long term view and beliefs\n\n4. Think that putin just sat back for 22 years despite his burning desire to annex everyone in the former USSR. He has had more than ample opportunity to annex neighbouring, much weaker countries (including ukraine)\n\n5. Ignore the strategic position and perspective of the russian state, despite it being self explanatory WHY they would hold these views. (I even made a thread the other day on this sub which provides a detailed explanation of how expansion worsened Russia's security position).\n\n6. Ignore Putin's repeated acknowledgement of Ukrainian sovereignty so you can claim he doesn't consider them a sovereign country.\n\n7. Ignore that he made his demands pre-invasion to... NATO. At no point has this conflict been just russia-ukraine.\n\nIt's just frankly not credible. Obviously it's a narrative that we wish to push because it absolves us of any potential culpability and that conflicts with our desired perception of ourselves.\n\nThe territorial 'annexation' is certainly an odd one, but it's also something that happened 8 months into the war when russia was failing. Thus it can be seen as a change in strategy given the initial aims of the war had become obviously unattainable. If you can't exert political control via regime change etc, then ensure the rump nato-aligned state poses as little threat as possible (would be my reading).\n\n\n>  I would also love to hear how that, in any way, is similar to Taiwan's situation? After all, that's the crux of the issue, not NATO.\n\nI mean. A foreign power intervened to help a breakaway province detach itself from the country. It's directly comparable to Taiwan. (and kosovo for that matter).\n\nAgaiin we come back to cognitive dissonance. We support such actions when it suits us, but have to pretend they are fundamentally different.",

But then NS2 ruptured right where Russian vessels/crew took over after the Swiss company ceased work due to sanctions. Since NS2 rupture would have likely caused an examination of NS1, Russians decided to trigger their charges on NS1 (17 hours after the NS2 leak).\n\nOliver points out that damage to NS1 pipes looks completely different (mangled, complete destruction) from that of NS2 (relatively clean rupture).\n\nPrev discussion: https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/118xtw9/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_22_2023/j9mj0dw/\n\n---\n\nMy question (I couldn't find anything): is there any publicly available data on the pressure levels of NS2? It is known that the Russians were burning natural gas intended for the EU market as they had no storage facilities (everything was full). Is it possible that they used NS2 as a temporary storage option and pumped a larger than usuaul amount of gas into NS2, thereby increasing the pressure?",

Since NS2 rupture would have likely caused an examination of NS1, Russians decided to trigger their charges on NS1 (17 hours after the NS2 leak).</p>\n\n<p>Oliver points out that damage to NS1 pipes looks completely different (mangled, complete destruction) from that of NS2 (relatively clean rupture).</p>\n\n<p>Prev discussion: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/118xtw9/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_22_2023/j9mj0dw/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/118xtw9/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_22_2023/j9mj0dw/</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>My question (I couldn&#39;t find anything): is there any publicly available data on the pressure levels of NS2? It is known that the Russians were burning natural gas intended for the EU market as they had no storage facilities (everything was full). Is it possible that they used NS2 as a temporary storage option and pumped a larger than usuaul amount of gas into NS2, thereby increasing the pressure?</p>\n</div>",

This makes more sense to me, especially when paired with the speculation above that the Russians had the pipelines wired with explosives, but a leak in one forced their hands to follow through earlier than initially planned.

It's interesting as it doesn't appear to share any architectural heritage with previous designs. I'll just paste the conclusion section since it's concise and clearly written:\n\n>AMD\u2019s CDNA2 focuses on the HPC market, with high FP64 throughput and lip service paid to lower precision matrix multiplication throughput. Nvidia\u2019s Hopper and Intel\u2019s Ponte Vecchio try to hit both fronts. With BR100, Biren focused on creating the most powerful machine learning GPU they could, while paying lip service to other GPGPU applications.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The result is a GPU that largely matches Nvidia\u2019s H100 in matrix multiplication throughput, but falls behind in other categories. But theoretical figures are only one part of the story. BR100\u2019s standout feature is a unique, CPU-like caching setup that can present a 256 MB unified L2 cache. Even AMD\u2019s Infinity Cache in RDNA2 is only 128 MB in size. Considering BR100\u2019s lower memory bandwidth and lower max occupancy, Biren is probably hoping to lean on the L2 cache to keep performance up. I\u2019m still curious about whether Biren\u2019s mesh links can keep up, but it\u2019s fascinating that Biren is using an Infinity Cache like approach in the compute scene, while AMD and Nvidia have preferred to use smaller caches and a ton of DRAM bandwidth.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>BR100 should provide Chinese customers with plenty of machine learning throughput, and give them an alternative to buying Nvidia or AMD products, considering recent restrictions. Customers using BR100 for other GPGPU applications will get some mileage out of BR100, assuming they don\u2019t need FP64. Its vector FP32 throughput alone is still quite high compared to what you can get out of a CPU, while its flexible caching strategy and HBM should have no trouble keeping those execution units fed. But BR100 still puts AI first, and other non-matrix applications a distant second.",

I&#39;ll just paste the conclusion section since it&#39;s concise and clearly written:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>AMD\u2019s CDNA2 focuses on the HPC market, with high FP64 throughput and lip service paid to lower precision matrix multiplication throughput. Nvidia\u2019s Hopper and Intel\u2019s Ponte Vecchio try to hit both fronts. With BR100, Biren focused on creating the most powerful machine learning GPU they could, while paying lip service to other GPGPU applications.  </p>\n\n<p>The result is a GPU that largely matches Nvidia\u2019s H100 in matrix multiplication throughput, but falls behind in other categories. But theoretical figures are only one part of the story. BR100\u2019s standout feature is a unique, CPU-like caching setup that can present a 256 MB unified L2 cache. Even AMD\u2019s Infinity Cache in RDNA2 is only 128 MB in size. Considering BR100\u2019s lower memory bandwidth and lower max occupancy, Biren is probably hoping to lean on the L2 cache to keep performance up. I\u2019m still curious about whether Biren\u2019s mesh links can keep up, but it\u2019s fascinating that Biren is using an Infinity Cache like approach in the compute scene, while AMD and Nvidia have preferred to use smaller caches and a ton of DRAM bandwidth.  </p>\n\n<p>BR100 should provide Chinese customers with plenty of machine learning throughput, and give them an alternative to buying Nvidia or AMD products, considering recent restrictions. Customers using BR100 for other GPGPU applications will get some mileage out of BR100, assuming they don\u2019t need FP64. Its vector FP32 throughput alone is still quite high compared to what you can get out of a CPU, while its flexible caching strategy and HBM should have no trouble keeping those execution units fed. But BR100 still puts AI first, and other non-matrix applications a distant second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Part of this plan referenced by the poster above is :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTransferring the function of OH-1 Helicopters to unmanned UAVs (scan eagles)\n\nGetting rid of AH-1S and AH-64D helicopters (they cite 60 airframes, netting a reduction of 1000 personnel). The cited reason is that its due to introduction of unmanned \"attack drones\" (\u653b\u6483\u7528 UAV\uff09though i dont see specifically which ones.

                "body": "Article in full:\n\n>The U.S. Energy Department has concluded that the Covid pandemic most likely arose from a laboratory leak, according to a classified intelligence report recently provided to the White House and key members of Congress.\n\n>The shift by the Energy Department, which previously was undecided on how the virus emerged, is noted in an update to a 2021 document by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines\u2019s office.\n\n>The new report highlights how different parts of the intelligence community have arrived at disparate judgments about the pandemic\u2019s origin. The Energy Department now joins the Federal Bureau of Investigation in saying the virus likely spread via a mishap at a Chinese laboratory. **Four other agencies, along with a national intelligence panel, still judge that it was likely the result of a natural transmission, and two are undecided.**\n\n>The Energy Department\u2019s conclusion is the result of new intelligence and is significant because the agency has considerable scientific expertise and oversees a network of U.S. national laboratories, some of which conduct advanced biological research.\n\n>**The Energy Department made its judgment with \u201clow confidence,\u201d according to people who have read the classified report.**\nThe FBI previously came to the conclusion that the pandemic was likely the result of a lab leak in 2021 with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d and still holds to this view.\n\n>The FBI employs a cadre of microbiologists, immunologists and other scientists and is supported by the National Bioforensic Analysis Center, which was established at Fort Detrick, Md., in 2004 to analyze anthrax and other possible biological threats.\n\n>U.S. officials declined to give details on the fresh intelligence and analysis that led the Energy Department to change its position. They added that while the Energy Department and the FBI each say an unintended lab leak is most likely, they arrived at those conclusions for different reasons.\n\n>The updated document underscores how intelligence officials are still putting together the pieces on how Covid-19 emerged. More than one million Americans have died in the pandemic that began more than three years ago.\n\n>The National Intelligence Council, which conducts long-term strategic analysis, and four agencies, which officials declined to identify, still assess with \u201clow confidence\u201d that the virus came about through natural transmission from an infected animal, according to the updated report.\n\n>**The Central Intelligence Agency and another agency that officials wouldn\u2019t name remain undecided between the lab-leak and natural-transmission theories, the people who have read the classified report said.**\n\n>Despite the agencies\u2019 differing analyses, the **update reaffirmed an existing consensus between them that Covid-19 wasn\u2019t the result of a Chinese biological-weapons program, the people who have read the classified report said.**\n\n>A senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed that the intelligence community had conducted the update, whose existence hasn\u2019t previously been reported. This official added that it was done in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and consultation with experts outside government.\n\n>The update, which is less than five pages, wasn\u2019t requested by Congress. But lawmakers, particularly House and Senate Republicans, are pursuing their own investigations into the origins of the pandemic and are pressing the Biden administration and the intelligence community for more information.\nOfficials didn\u2019t say if an unclassified version of the update would be issued.\n\n>The Covid-19 virus first circulated in Wuhan, China, no later than November 2019, according to the U.S. 2021 intelligence report. The pandemic\u2019s origin has been the subject of vigorous, sometimes partisan debate among academics, intelligence experts and lawmakers.\n\n>David Relman, a Stanford University microbiologist who has argued for a dispassionate investigation into the pandemic\u2019s beginnings, welcomed word of the updated findings.\n\u201cKudos to those who are willing to set aside their preconceptions and objectively re-examine what we know and don\u2019t know about Covid origins,\u201d said Dr. Relman, who has served on several federal scientific-advisory boards. \u201cMy plea is that we not accept an incomplete answer or give up because of political expediency.\u201d\n\n>An Energy Department spokesman declined to discuss details of its assessment but wrote in a statement that the agency \u201ccontinues to support the thorough, careful, and objective work of our intelligence professionals in investigating the origins of COVID-19, as the President directed.\u201d\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\n>China, which has placed limits on investigations by the World Health Organization, has disputed that the virus could have leaked from one of its labs and has suggested it emerged outside China.\nThe Chinese government didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about whether there has been any change in its views on the origins of Covid-19.\n\n>**Some scientists argue that the virus probably emerged naturally and leapt from an animal to a human**, the same pathway for outbreaks of previously unknown pathogens.\n\n>Intelligence analysts who have supported that view give weight to \u201cthe precedent of past novel infectious disease outbreaks having zoonotic origins,\u201d the flourishing trade in a diverse set of animals that are susceptible to such infections, and their conclusion that Chinese officials didn\u2019t have foreknowledge of the virus, the 2021 report said.\n\n>Yet no confirmed animal source for Covid-19 has been identified. The lack of an animal source, and the fact that Wuhan is the center of China\u2019s extensive coronavirus research, has led some scientists and U.S. officials to argue that a lab leak is the best explanation for the pandemic\u2019s beginning.\n\n>U.S. State Department cables written in 2018 and internal Chinese documents show that there were persistent concerns about China\u2019s biosafety procedures, which have been cited by proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis.\n\n>Wuhan is home to an array of laboratories, many of which were built or expanded as a result of China\u2019s traumatic experience with the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, epidemic beginning in 2002. They include campuses of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, which produces vaccines.\n\n>An outbreak at a seafood market in Wuhan had initially been thought to be the source of the virus, but some scientists and Chinese public-health officials now see it as an example of community spread rather than the place where the first human infection occurred, the 2021 intelligence community report said.\n\n>In May 2021, President Biden told the intelligence community to step up its efforts to investigate the origins of Covid-19 and directed that the review draw on work by the U.S.\u2019s national laboratories and other agencies. Congress, he said, would be kept informed of that effort.\n\n>The October 2021 report said that there was a consensus that Covid-19 wasn\u2019t the result of a Chinese biological-weapons program. But it didn\u2019t settle the debate over whether it resulted from a lab leak or came from an animal, saying that more information was needed from the Chinese authorities.\n\n>The U.S. intelligence community is made up of 18 agencies, including offices at the Energy, State and Treasury departments. Eight of them participated in the Covid-origins review, along with the National Intelligence Council.\n\n>Before that report, the Energy Department\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory prepared a study in May 2020 concluding that a lab-leak hypothesis was plausible and deserved further investigation.\nThe debate over whether Covid-19 might have escaped from a laboratory has been fueled by U.S. intelligence that three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care.\n\n>A House Intelligence Committee report concluded last year that this disclosure didn\u2019t strengthen either the lab-leak or the natural-origin theory as the researchers might have become sick with a seasonal flu.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Article in full:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. Energy Department has concluded that the Covid pandemic most likely arose from a laboratory leak, according to a classified intelligence report recently provided to the White House and key members of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The shift by the Energy Department, which previously was undecided on how the virus emerged, is noted in an update to a 2021 document by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines\u2019s office.</p>\n\n<p>The new report highlights how different parts of the intelligence community have arrived at disparate judgments about the pandemic\u2019s origin. The Energy Department now joins the Federal Bureau of Investigation in saying the virus likely spread via a mishap at a Chinese laboratory. <strong>Four other agencies, along with a national intelligence panel, still judge that it was likely the result of a natural transmission, and two are undecided.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Energy Department\u2019s conclusion is the result of new intelligence and is significant because the agency has considerable scientific expertise and oversees a network of U.S. national laboratories, some of which conduct advanced biological research.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Energy Department made its judgment with \u201clow confidence,\u201d according to people who have read the classified report.</strong>\nThe FBI previously came to the conclusion that the pandemic was likely the result of a lab leak in 2021 with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d and still holds to this view.</p>\n\n<p>The FBI employs a cadre of microbiologists, immunologists and other scientists and is supported by the National Bioforensic Analysis Center, which was established at Fort Detrick, Md., in 2004 to analyze anthrax and other possible biological threats.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials declined to give details on the fresh intelligence and analysis that led the Energy Department to change its position. They added that while the Energy Department and the FBI each say an unintended lab leak is most likely, they arrived at those conclusions for different reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The updated document underscores how intelligence officials are still putting together the pieces on how Covid-19 emerged. More than one million Americans have died in the pandemic that began more than three years ago.</p>\n\n<p>The National Intelligence Council, which conducts long-term strategic analysis, and four agencies, which officials declined to identify, still assess with \u201clow confidence\u201d that the virus came about through natural transmission from an infected animal, according to the updated report.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Central Intelligence Agency and another agency that officials wouldn\u2019t name remain undecided between the lab-leak and natural-transmission theories, the people who have read the classified report said.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite the agencies\u2019 differing analyses, the <strong>update reaffirmed an existing consensus between them that Covid-19 wasn\u2019t the result of a Chinese biological-weapons program, the people who have read the classified report said.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed that the intelligence community had conducted the update, whose existence hasn\u2019t previously been reported. This official added that it was done in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and consultation with experts outside government.</p>\n\n<p>The update, which is less than five pages, wasn\u2019t requested by Congress. But lawmakers, particularly House and Senate Republicans, are pursuing their own investigations into the origins of the pandemic and are pressing the Biden administration and the intelligence community for more information.\nOfficials didn\u2019t say if an unclassified version of the update would be issued.</p>\n\n<p>The Covid-19 virus first circulated in Wuhan, China, no later than November 2019, according to the U.S. 2021 intelligence report. The pandemic\u2019s origin has been the subject of vigorous, sometimes partisan debate among academics, intelligence experts and lawmakers.</p>\n\n<p>David Relman, a Stanford University microbiologist who has argued for a dispassionate investigation into the pandemic\u2019s beginnings, welcomed word of the updated findings.\n\u201cKudos to those who are willing to set aside their preconceptions and objectively re-examine what we know and don\u2019t know about Covid origins,\u201d said Dr. Relman, who has served on several federal scientific-advisory boards. \u201cMy plea is that we not accept an incomplete answer or give up because of political expediency.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>An Energy Department spokesman declined to discuss details of its assessment but wrote in a statement that the agency \u201ccontinues to support the thorough, careful, and objective work of our intelligence professionals in investigating the origins of COVID-19, as the President directed.\u201d\nThe FBI declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>China, which has placed limits on investigations by the World Health Organization, has disputed that the virus could have leaked from one of its labs and has suggested it emerged outside China.\nThe Chinese government didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about whether there has been any change in its views on the origins of Covid-19.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some scientists argue that the virus probably emerged naturally and leapt from an animal to a human</strong>, the same pathway for outbreaks of previously unknown pathogens.</p>\n\n<p>Intelligence analysts who have supported that view give weight to \u201cthe precedent of past novel infectious disease outbreaks having zoonotic origins,\u201d the flourishing trade in a diverse set of animals that are susceptible to such infections, and their conclusion that Chinese officials didn\u2019t have foreknowledge of the virus, the 2021 report said.</p>\n\n<p>Yet no confirmed animal source for Covid-19 has been identified. The lack of an animal source, and the fact that Wuhan is the center of China\u2019s extensive coronavirus research, has led some scientists and U.S. officials to argue that a lab leak is the best explanation for the pandemic\u2019s beginning.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. State Department cables written in 2018 and internal Chinese documents show that there were persistent concerns about China\u2019s biosafety procedures, which have been cited by proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis.</p>\n\n<p>Wuhan is home to an array of laboratories, many of which were built or expanded as a result of China\u2019s traumatic experience with the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, epidemic beginning in 2002. They include campuses of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, which produces vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>An outbreak at a seafood market in Wuhan had initially been thought to be the source of the virus, but some scientists and Chinese public-health officials now see it as an example of community spread rather than the place where the first human infection occurred, the 2021 intelligence community report said.</p>\n\n<p>In May 2021, President Biden told the intelligence community to step up its efforts to investigate the origins of Covid-19 and directed that the review draw on work by the U.S.\u2019s national laboratories and other agencies. Congress, he said, would be kept informed of that effort.</p>\n\n<p>The October 2021 report said that there was a consensus that Covid-19 wasn\u2019t the result of a Chinese biological-weapons program. But it didn\u2019t settle the debate over whether it resulted from a lab leak or came from an animal, saying that more information was needed from the Chinese authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. intelligence community is made up of 18 agencies, including offices at the Energy, State and Treasury departments. Eight of them participated in the Covid-origins review, along with the National Intelligence Council.</p>\n\n<p>Before that report, the Energy Department\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory prepared a study in May 2020 concluding that a lab-leak hypothesis was plausible and deserved further investigation.\nThe debate over whether Covid-19 might have escaped from a laboratory has been fueled by U.S. intelligence that three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care.</p>\n\n<p>A House Intelligence Committee report concluded last year that this disclosure didn\u2019t strengthen either the lab-leak or the natural-origin theory as the researchers might have become sick with a seasonal flu. But some former U.S. officials say the sick researchers were involved in coronavirus research.</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers have sought to find out more about why the FBI assesses a lab leak was likely. In an Aug. 1 letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, requested that the FBI share the records of its investigation and asked if the bureau had briefed Mr. Biden on its findings.</p>\n\n<p>In a Nov. 18 letter, FBI Assistant Director Jill Tyson said the agency couldn\u2019t share those details because of Justice Department policy on preserving \u201cthe integrity of ongoing investigations.\u201d She referred the senator to Ms. Haines\u2019s office for information on what briefings were arranged for the president.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Russia can conscript a lot of people, but they all probably lack basic training and material support, while Ukraine can conscript a lot that is properly trained by NATO in NATO countries with financial support and is fielded with the best NATO equipment. My guess is RU forces will have more men, but UKR will have better training and recourses. If I was a betting man I'd bet on Ukraine, because they have the backing of the US, Eu and most of the democratic Asian countries.",

Even the total GDP... which people started speculating that it would never surpass the US during the zero-covid lockdowns now falls back to 2030 after their ultra-fast economic recovery. The crown jewel of power status that the US held since taking it from the British Empire over a century and half ago.\n\nI am arguing that the weight of economics in global power is *far* more important than the military aspect.

Nuclear weapons, status and nature of current conflicts, International formalized rules/institutions, Public perceptions on the legitimacy of interventions, and international perceptions with precedence regarding sovereignty.

If you don&#39;t want to recognize that, it&#39;s your call but I&#39;m not sure I can render the point down for you in a less threatening way than I already have. </p>\n\n<p>At this point I think we can both marvel at the pedantic denseness of the other and call it a day.</p>\n</div>",

That's what Mearsheimer's theory predicted for the future of Europe back in 1990.\n\nA worrying thought: it's possible that the Europe wars of 1990 didn't come to be because all European states are, in fact, vassal states of the US, and the US won't allow its vassals to fight each other.

He wasn&#39;t talking about a war in the Balkans or something small. His prediction, based on Offensive Realism, was that Germany, France, and the UK would go back to fighting each other right away. He even advocated giving Germany nukes ASAP, or else France would seize its chance and attack DE first. Sounds insane, right? That&#39;s what Mearsheimer&#39;s theory predicted for the future of Europe back in 1990.</p>\n\n<p>A worrying thought: it&#39;s possible that the Europe wars of 1990 didn&#39;t come to be because all European states are, in fact, vassal states of the US, and the US won&#39;t allow its vassals to fight each other. Just as the vassal states of the USSR didn&#39;t fight each other (because USSR wouldn&#39;t allow it). It might be if the US leaves the EU be, it might erupt into wars again, and that nice Democratic Peace Theory will come to naught.</p>\n</div>",
