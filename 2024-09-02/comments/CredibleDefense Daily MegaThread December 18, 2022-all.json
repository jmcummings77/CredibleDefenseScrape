Also used in India and Pakistan so often seen in the 60s era conflicts. Used the earlier NATO cartridge of 7.62, before the US picked up on the 5.56 for the M-16. Great at shooting out to 300m and one of the most accurate of the assault rifles but a bit big and clumsy in vehicles and helicopters which was a reason for its replacement by shorter rifles around the  world.</p>\n\n<p>It is visually iconic of the early Cold War, though due to the conflicts it was most associated with did not really stay in popular culture like the M-16 and AK-47.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/World_operators_of_the_FN_FAL.png\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/World_operators_of_the_FN_FAL.png</a></p>\n\n<p>The red is current operators so its still in wide use around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Good rifle for a trench. But old so likely the parts will be lose and the accuracy gone.</p>\n</div>",

It takes a pretty long time to do that, and the problems it creates are different than the ones they describe.</p>\n\n<p>If anything it sounds more like their issues were general dirt and mud, as he mentions explicitly dirt getting on the guns, and the malfunctions are feeding problems which could easily be caused by dirt in the action.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to guess, one of the reasons the FAL kept chugging longer than the AK-74s is the rounds it was shooting are higher pressure than the 5.45x39 and so it was blowing some dirt out and generally keeping the bolt moving faster. If you&#39;ve ever shot a FAL (in fact this is true of many military gas operated weapons) you&#39;ll see they eject the casings very aggressively. They are &quot;overgassed&quot; specifically to make it less likely for them to jam.</p>\n</div>",

The problem is that China can launch missile strikes across Taiwan with impunity, and can also effectively blockade the island through air and missiles, without having to deploy vulnerable naval assets.  So it could turn into a situation like US-Japan at the end of WW2.

Instead focusing on equipping Strykers with a 30mm main gun.\n\nThe MGS was meant to give Stryker infantry battalions in particular their own fire support, so blowing up anything from enemy bunkers to light armor. \n\nThe Dragoon variant, which is what has the single 30mm gun, was meant to replace some of the standard infantry carrier vehicle (ICV) which are the most common Stryker found in a SBCT. Normally those mount a .50 cal machine gun or MK-19 40mm automatic grenade launcher mounted on a remote weapon station, meant to support the dismounted infantry. That worked out since the Stryker was designed for small wars (COIN, peacekeeping, etc), not for fighting maneuver warfare against the 1st Guards Tank Army. \n\nBut when Cold War 2.0 started, there were only two permanently stationed US Army brigades in Europe. The light infantry 173rd Airborne IBCT in Italy, and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Germany, which was a Stryker BCT. To put that in perspective, during the Cold War the US Army had 10 armored divisions in W. Germany. While a .50 cal and MK-19 both can technically kill a BMP or BTR at certain ranges, angles, and with certain ammo, both suck at it. For 2CR to survive such a campaign against 1GTA without relying on their dismounts using Javelins and AT-4s to do all the anti-armor work, they needed the vehicle armament to kill BMPs and BTRs. So they requested an upgunned Stryker ICV variant, which just so happened to already be in advanced stages of testing with General Dynamics. Because the Army was refocused away from small wars/COIN towards Near Peer, specifically against Russia, that got the ball rolling to quickly acquire the Dragoon variants. \n\nMeanwhile, since the mid 2000s, the MGS had problems. Myself having served in a Stryker Brigade, including time in a mixed infantry-MGS platoon, I can attest, they had issues. They were very heavy, the carousel loader had issues, they didn't have air conditioning, they weren't reliable, etc. There was a desire to get rid of them but there was no replacement on the horizon, which meant if they got rid of them before a replacement was found then the infantrymen lose their fire support. However, then the Dragoon showed up, at which point the MGS was finally shitcanned and its roll was basically abolished, they don't need an MGS when half of the ICV can perform that roll with their organic 30mm guns.",
