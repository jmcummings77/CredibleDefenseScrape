        "body": "More in-depth reporting from the NYT on a key and previously discussed story:\n\n>[In Rush to Arm Ukraine, Weapons Are Bought but Not Delivered, or Too Broken to Use](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-howitzers-contracts.html)\n\n>Some of the weapons sent to Ukraine by other countries have been unusable, and hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts paid up front have yet to be fulfilled.\n\n>Ukraine has paid contractors hundreds of millions of dollars for weapons that have not been delivered, and some of the much-publicized arms donated by its allies have been so decrepit that they were deemed fit only to be cannibalized for spare parts.\n\n>Ukrainian government documents show that as of the end of last year, Kyiv had paid arms suppliers more than $800 million since the Russian invasion in February 2022 for contracts that went completely or partly unfulfilled.\n\n>Two people involved in Ukraine\u2019s arms purchasing said that some of the missing weapons had eventually been delivered, and that in other cases brokers had refunded the money. But as of early this spring, hundreds of millions of dollars had been paid \u2014 including to state-owned companies \u2014 for arms never materialized, one of these people said.\n\n>\u201cWe did have cases where we paid money and we didn\u2019t receive,\u201d Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defense minister working on arms procurement, said in a recent interview. He said the government this year had begun analyzing its past purchases and excluding problematic contractors.\n\n>**Problems are inevitable in an arms-acquisition frenzy the size of Ukraine\u2019s**. Since Russia invaded last year, Western allies have sent Ukraine tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons. As of last week, the United States alone had committed about $40 billion worth of military aid (and more in financial and humanitarian assistance), and European allies have also contributed tens of billions. In addition, Ukraine has spent billions of dollars of its own on the private arms market.\n\n>**Many of the transfers from Western allies have involved modern weapons like American air defense systems that have proven highly effective** against Russian drones and missiles. But in other cases allies have provided stockpiled equipment that, at best, needed extensive overhauls.\n\n>**As much of 30 percent of Kyiv\u2019s arsenal is under repair at any given time \u2014 a high rate, defense experts said**, for a military that needs every weapon it can get for its developing counteroffensive.\n\n>\u201cIf I was the head of an army that has gifted kit to Ukraine, I\u2019d be professionally very embarrassed if I turned stuff around in bad order,\u201d said Ben Barry, a land warfare expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\n>A recent delivery of 33 self-propelled howitzers donated by the Italian government provides a case in point. Videos showed smoke billowing from the engine of one, and engine coolant leaking from another.\n\n>Italy\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement that the vehicles had been decommissioned years ago but that Ukraine had asked for them anyway, \u201cto be overhauled and put into operation, given the urgent need for means to face the Russian aggression.\u201d\n\n>Ukrainian government documents show that its Defense Ministry paid $19.8 million to an American arms dealer, the Tampa-based Ultra Defense Corporation, to have the 33 howitzers repaired. In January, 13 of those howitzers were shipped to Ukraine but arrived \u201cnot suitable for combat missions,\u201d according to one of the documents.\n\n>Officials in Kyiv accused the American company of failing to finish a job that was supposed to be completed by late December. \u201cThe American company, offering its services, had no prior intention to fulfill its obligations,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defense procurement director, Volodymyr Pikuzo, wrote in a Feb. 3 letter to the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general.\n\n>Matthew Herring, the company\u2019s chief executive, strongly denied the accusation. \u201cEvery single one of them worked when we delivered them,\u201d he wrote in a text message this month, saying that the Ukrainians had not properly maintained the howitzers after they were handed over. That included the one with a coolant leak, which he said had \u201cmagically appeared after delivery in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n>The Pentagon\u2019s inspector general is investigating the matter, according to a United States defense official and an American who has worked with Ukraine to procure weapons.\n\n>Ukrainian officials have mostly refrained from complaining about broken equipment, so as not to embarrass their benefactors. \u201cThere were issues of quality to some of the howitzers, but we have to keep in mind that it was a gift,\u201d Mr. Havrylov said.\n\n>But the government in Kyiv has grown weary, another senior Ukrainian official said, of being told that it has enough Western weapons, when some arrive in poor or unusable condition, relegated from combat to be cannibalized for parts.\n\n>The official, like some others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly discuss a sensitive security matter that risks causing friction between allies. Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry declined to comment.\n\n>Problems with arming the military are as old as post-Soviet Ukraine itself, pulled for decades between competing factions with different visions for the country\u2019s arms industry.\n\n>After Ukraine gained independence in 1991, it made considerable sums by selling off items from its extensive stocks of Soviet-era weapons. **The country\u2019s arsenal shrank, particularly under President Viktor F. Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian leader in the early 2010s.** In the years after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a heated debate erupted over whether and to what extent to reinvigorate its arms industry.\n\n>But changes were slow, and when Russia invaded last year Kyiv found itself desperate for weapons and ammunition. Its leaders scrambled to find arms wherever they could. Brokers, many unreliable, flooded Ukraine with offers, said Mr. Havrylov.\n\n>The documents obtained by The New York Times, generated by a government audit this year, showed that some of the most valuable sets of undelivered contracts are between the Defense Ministry and state-owned Ukrainian arms companies that function as independent brokers. In recent months, the ministry has sued at least two of those state firms over unfulfilled contracts, and Ukraine recently announced overhauls aimed at making those companies more efficient.\n\n>There have been problems with Western-donated equipment as well, which contributed to some of its being delivered so belatedly or unpredictably as to complicate planning for Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive.\n\n>A Pentagon inspector general\u2019s report released in late May illustrates some of the problems.\n\n>Last summer, an American Army unit was ordered to ship 29 Humvees to Ukraine from a depot at Camp Arifjan, a base in Kuwait. Although the unit\u2019s leaders had previously said that all but one of the Humvees were \u201cfully mission capable,\u201d an initial inspection after the orders were received revealed that 26 of them were too broken for combat, according to the Pentagon report.\n\n>By late August, contractors had repaired transmissions, dead batteries, fluid leaks, broken lights, door latches and seatbelts on the Humvees, and reported that all 29 were ready for Ukraine. The work was verified by the Army unit in Kuwait.\n\n>But when the Humvees reached a staging base in Poland, officials found that the tires on 25 of them were rotten. It took nearly a month to find enough replacement tires, which \u201cdelayed the shipment of other equipment to Ukraine and required significant labor and time,\u201d the Pentagon report found.\n\n>The same Army unit in Kuwait was also supposed to send six M777 howitzers to Ukraine just weeks after the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. As it turned out, however, the howitzers \u201crequired extensive maintenance\u201d before they could be shipped, because they had gone without regular service checks for 19 months, the Pentagon report found.\n\n>At least one was in such bad shape that it **\u201cwould have killed somebody\u201d** trying to use it, inspectors concluded in March 2022.\n\n>Three months later, the howitzers had been repaired and shipped to the staging center in Poland. But officials there still concluded that all six \u201chad faults that made them non-mission capable,\u201d the Pentagon audit found. They were repaired in Poland before being sent to Ukraine.\n\n>Some weapons systems are either so scarce or so vulnerable to breaking down that Ukraine has welcomed at least some of the faulty Western equipment as a source of parts.\n\n>In January, Britain\u2019s defense secretary, Ben Wallace, announced the planned transfer of self-propelled AS-90 howitzers to Ukraine, including some in \u201cvarying states of readiness.\u201d Twelve required Ukraine \u201cto either refurbish or exploit for spares,\u201d the British Defense Ministry said in a statement in March.\n\n>The senior Ukrainian official confirmed that they were needed to supply spare parts for others.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>More in-depth reporting from the NYT on a key and previously discussed story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-howitzers-contracts.html\">In Rush to Arm Ukraine, Weapons Are Bought but Not Delivered, or Too Broken to Use</a></p>\n\n<p>Some of the weapons sent to Ukraine by other countries have been unusable, and hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts paid up front have yet to be fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has paid contractors hundreds of millions of dollars for weapons that have not been delivered, and some of the much-publicized arms donated by its allies have been so decrepit that they were deemed fit only to be cannibalized for spare parts.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian government documents show that as of the end of last year, Kyiv had paid arms suppliers more than $800 million since the Russian invasion in February 2022 for contracts that went completely or partly unfulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>Two people involved in Ukraine\u2019s arms purchasing said that some of the missing weapons had eventually been delivered, and that in other cases brokers had refunded the money. But as of early this spring, hundreds of millions of dollars had been paid \u2014 including to state-owned companies \u2014 for arms never materialized, one of these people said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe did have cases where we paid money and we didn\u2019t receive,\u201d Volodymyr Havrylov, a deputy defense minister working on arms procurement, said in a recent interview. He said the government this year had begun analyzing its past purchases and excluding problematic contractors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problems are inevitable in an arms-acquisition frenzy the size of Ukraine\u2019s</strong>. Since Russia invaded last year, Western allies have sent Ukraine tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons. As of last week, the United States alone had committed about $40 billion worth of military aid (and more in financial and humanitarian assistance), and European allies have also contributed tens of billions. In addition, Ukraine has spent billions of dollars of its own on the private arms market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Many of the transfers from Western allies have involved modern weapons like American air defense systems that have proven highly effective</strong> against Russian drones and missiles. But in other cases allies have provided stockpiled equipment that, at best, needed extensive overhauls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As much of 30 percent of Kyiv\u2019s arsenal is under repair at any given time \u2014 a high rate, defense experts said</strong>, for a military that needs every weapon it can get for its developing counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf I was the head of an army that has gifted kit to Ukraine, I\u2019d be professionally very embarrassed if I turned stuff around in bad order,\u201d said Ben Barry, a land warfare expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.</p>\n\n<p>A recent delivery of 33 self-propelled howitzers donated by the Italian government provides a case in point. Videos showed smoke billowing from the engine of one, and engine coolant leaking from another.</p>\n\n<p>Italy\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement that the vehicles had been decommissioned years ago but that Ukraine had asked for them anyway, \u201cto be overhauled and put into operation, given the urgent need for means to face the Russian aggression.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian government documents show that its Defense Ministry paid $19.8 million to an American arms dealer, the Tampa-based Ultra Defense Corporation, to have the 33 howitzers repaired. In January, 13 of those howitzers were shipped to Ukraine but arrived \u201cnot suitable for combat missions,\u201d according to one of the documents.</p>\n\n<p>Officials in Kyiv accused the American company of failing to finish a job that was supposed to be completed by late December. \u201cThe American company, offering its services, had no prior intention to fulfill its obligations,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defense procurement director, Volodymyr Pikuzo, wrote in a Feb. 3 letter to the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Herring, the company\u2019s chief executive, strongly denied the accusation. \u201cEvery single one of them worked when we delivered them,\u201d he wrote in a text message this month, saying that the Ukrainians had not properly maintained the howitzers after they were handed over. That included the one with a coolant leak, which he said had \u201cmagically appeared after delivery in Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon\u2019s inspector general is investigating the matter, according to a United States defense official and an American who has worked with Ukraine to procure weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials have mostly refrained from complaining about broken equipment, so as not to embarrass their benefactors. \u201cThere were issues of quality to some of the howitzers, but we have to keep in mind that it was a gift,\u201d Mr. Havrylov said.</p>\n\n<p>But the government in Kyiv has grown weary, another senior Ukrainian official said, of being told that it has enough Western weapons, when some arrive in poor or unusable condition, relegated from combat to be cannibalized for parts.</p>\n\n<p>The official, like some others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly discuss a sensitive security matter that risks causing friction between allies. Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>Problems with arming the military are as old as post-Soviet Ukraine itself, pulled for decades between competing factions with different visions for the country\u2019s arms industry.</p>\n\n<p>After Ukraine gained independence in 1991, it made considerable sums by selling off items from its extensive stocks of Soviet-era weapons. <strong>The country\u2019s arsenal shrank, particularly under President Viktor F. Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian leader in the early 2010s.</strong> In the years after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a heated debate erupted over whether and to what extent to reinvigorate its arms industry.</p>\n\n<p>But changes were slow, and when Russia invaded last year Kyiv found itself desperate for weapons and ammunition. Its leaders scrambled to find arms wherever they could.

Xi said it was \u201cvery good\u201d the two sides made progress on stabilizing the relationship. \u201cThe two sides have also made progress and reached agreements on some specific issues,\u201d Xi said, without elaborating, in comments show on state TV.\n\n>But while the US diplomat\u2019s visit may have helped get ties back on track, there was no sign that his meeting helped to resolve major differences on a range of issues that divide the two countries. There was no sign of progress on restoring direct contacts between the two countries\u2019 militaries, something the US has been eager for progress on amid increasing tensions between forces around Taiwan and elsewhere. \n\n>>Taiwan Security\n\n>The US and China also remain at odds over trade and intellectual-property disputes, human rights concerns, Taiwan\u2019s security, China\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and US limits on advanced technology.\n\n>While specific agreements were sparse, the upbeat words indicate that both sides are ready to turn back the clock to November, when Xi and US President Joe Biden pledged to improve relations during a meeting in Indonesia. That process was derailed in February after an alleged Chinese spy balloon floated through US air space, causing Blinken to cancel a trip to Beijing and bringing US-China relations to their lowest point in decades.\n\n>Blinken\u2019s meeting with Xi lays the groundwork for in-person talks between the two countries\u2019 leaders later this year. On Sunday, Foreign Minister Qin Gang accepted an invitation to visit Washington, the State Department said, after 7 1/2 hours of talks with Blinken that both sides described as \u201cproductive\u201d and \u201ccandid.\u201d \n\n>\u201cBlinken sets the stage for future interactions between different levels of government, the business community and academia and research,\u201d said Henry Wang, founder of the Center for China and Globalization. \u201cHe\u2019s brought a period of stabilization, of easing tensions for at least the second half of the year.\u201d\n\n>Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu has declined to meet with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin until Washington lifts sanctions against him. The US and Chinese militaries recently had two confrontations between naval vessels and jets in the region, which the Pentagon characterized as \u201cdangerous.\u201d  \n\n>>US Sanctions\n\n>In his meeting with Blinken, Wang Yi, China\u2019s top foreign policy official blasted \u201cillegal\u201d US sanctions and putting the blame for worsening ties on Washington, which he said had misunderstood China, according to China\u2019s Foreign Ministry. The US called it a \u201ccandid and productive discussion\u201d - diplomat-speak for a tough conversation. \n\n>Blinken underlined that the US is seeking to \u201cde-risk\u201d its relationship with China but isn\u2019t seeking to \u201cde-couple\u201d from its largest trading partner or contain its economic rise. He portrayed the limits the US has imposed on technology exports to China as narrowly focused on sensitive national security areas, not sweeping limits. \n\n>Beijing so far doesn\u2019t appear to have been convinced.\n\n>\u201cWe have no illusions about the challenges of managing this relationship,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cThere are many issues on which we profoundly even vehemently disagree.\u201d\n\n>But China also has reasons to want to cool tensions. Beijing is facing an increasingly challenging geopolitical landscape, as the US blocks China\u2019s access to high-tech chips to thwart its military progress and puts pressure on Xi to condemn Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Geopolitical strains are also deterring foreign investment as China\u2019s economy faces domestic headwinds.\n\n>\u201cThe economy in China is not in great shape,\u201d George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre, told Bloomberg TV. \u201cHe wants to appeal and be seen to be constructive to Global South partners.\u201d\n\n>Blinken\u2019s visit became one of the top ten trending topics on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo after Xi\u2019s comments on Monday afternoon, with related hashtags getting millions of views. Under photos of Xi shaking hands with Blinken, some users called for US-China relations to \u201creturn to the right track.\u201d\n\n>That response was in contrast to the beginning of Blinken\u2019s visit when Weibo users pointed out the US official was greeted by red lines on the tarmac rather than a red carpet, and Chinese state media gave his trip muted coverage.\n\n>But after the Xi meeting, the official Xinhua news agency posted an item highlighting the lotus blossoms shown at the session, noting that the Chinese word for the flowers has the same pronounciation as the character for \u201ccooperation.\u201d",

Suicide VBIEDs or SVBIEDs were typically driven into convoys to detonate next to vehicles, into the mass of troops in a foot patrol, into vehicle traffic control points in town and entry TCP at combat outposts and forward operating bases. They only really worked with the element of surprise and low quality sentries who often weren't paying attention, lacked the heavy weapons to disable/destroy the VBIED, or the accuracy to hit them. \n\nArmored SVBIEDs showed up after the successful use of captured uparmored Humvees, they were resistant to small arms and to some extent the older generation of RPG-7s, at least according to Iraqis who lost faith in theirs. The US even sent cargo planes filled with 84mm AT-4 disposable recoilless rifles to increase Iraqi Security Forces' confidence in killing armored SVBIEDs.\n\nWhen insurgents went phase 3 uprising mode, no longer doing hit and run and instead taking and holding ground, they continued using armored SVBIEDs, with documented instances of up to 20 of them used in a row against a FOB under attack, with effects similar to MASSIVE PGM fixed wing, cruise, or ballistic missile strikes, followed up by a ground assault. The solution was standoff, destroying the vehicles at distance because if they let it get too close the secondary detonation's blast wave would temporarily incapacitate those on guard duty, allowing the next SVBIED to get a little closer, etc. Then they'd just keep driving them just a little bit deeper each time blowing gaps through the defenses, trying to get inside to drive into valuable buildings like barracks, command posts, field hospitals, etc.\n\nOther than defensive use in urban areas with hidden SVBIEDs popping out of hidden garages to go after nearby assault troops, offensive use of armored SVBIEDs were largely contained by various obstacles (tank traps, ditches, mines) and ATGMs or tanks to engage accurately and decisively at standoff ranges outside the blast effect. I am surprised the Russians can make this work in Ukraine. While everyone is shitting on the Russians for the desperation in trying it, it shouldn't work. That it seems to be to some extent is troubling and speaks to some significant problems with the Ukrainian defenses.",

They only really worked with the element of surprise and low quality sentries who often weren&#39;t paying attention, lacked the heavy weapons to disable/destroy the VBIED, or the accuracy to hit them. </p>\n\n<p>Armored SVBIEDs showed up after the successful use of captured uparmored Humvees, they were resistant to small arms and to some extent the older generation of RPG-7s, at least according to Iraqis who lost faith in theirs. The US even sent cargo planes filled with 84mm AT-4 disposable recoilless rifles to increase Iraqi Security Forces&#39; confidence in killing armored SVBIEDs.</p>\n\n<p>When insurgents went phase 3 uprising mode, no longer doing hit and run and instead taking and holding ground, they continued using armored SVBIEDs, with documented instances of up to 20 of them used in a row against a FOB under attack, with effects similar to MASSIVE PGM fixed wing, cruise, or ballistic missile strikes, followed up by a ground assault. The solution was standoff, destroying the vehicles at distance because if they let it get too close the secondary detonation&#39;s blast wave would temporarily incapacitate those on guard duty, allowing the next SVBIED to get a little closer, etc. Then they&#39;d just keep driving them just a little bit deeper each time blowing gaps through the defenses, trying to get inside to drive into valuable buildings like barracks, command posts, field hospitals, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Other than defensive use in urban areas with hidden SVBIEDs popping out of hidden garages to go after nearby assault troops, offensive use of armored SVBIEDs were largely contained by various obstacles (tank traps, ditches, mines) and ATGMs or tanks to engage accurately and decisively at standoff ranges outside the blast effect. I am surprised the Russians can make this work in Ukraine. While everyone is shitting on the Russians for the desperation in trying it, it shouldn&#39;t work. That it seems to be to some extent is troubling and speaks to some significant problems with the Ukrainian defenses.</p>\n</div>",

(****!!!****)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrice of 155mm shells:\n\nBecause of the aggravated security situation after the start of the Russian war against Ukraine, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius (SPD) wants to buy more ammunition for the Bundeswehr much faster. This should fill up the largely empty depots of the troops.According to SPIEGEL information, the ministry plans to present a total of nine contracts to the Bundestag's Budget Committee before the parliamentary summer recess, primarily for the accelerated purchase of artillery and tank ammunition. The committee must approve all purchases by the Bundeswehr over a value of 25 million euros. The last day of meetings before the summer break is Friday 7 July.16,000 projectiles for 118 million eurosWith the contracts Pistorius wants to boost the faster procurement of ammunition. To this end, more ammunition than previously planned is to be called off from existing framework agreements with the armaments industry; however, new contracts are also to be concluded. A confidential list by the military department of the projects explicitly mentions the \u201crecovery\u201d of ammunition handed over to Ukraine as the reason. But the \u00bbincrease in the stocks\u00ab of the Bundeswehr is also explicitly listed as a goal.**The first draft is primarily about increasing the purchase of 155 millimeter ammunition for the howitzers of the Bundeswehr. The ministry is planning to extend an existing framework agreement with the company Rheinmetall until 2026 and to buy a good 16,000 additional projectiles for a good 118 million euros.The corresponding ammunition has been optimized for the Bundeswehr's Panzerhaubitze 2000 and, according to the documents, is used for \"combating area and infrastructure targets\". With the howitzers, the projectiles enable precision strikes in a radius of a good 30 kilometers.**The amended framework agreement with Rheinmetall is only one of several projects of the ministry. According to the internal list of the so-called 25 million templates for the budget committee, further framework agreements are planned with both Rheinmetall and the arms manufacturer Diehl. Both are used to procure propellant charges for howitzer ammunition. At the same time, further contracts for time, proximity and impact fuses are to be concluded. In addition, the list also provides for another call from a framework agreement for 120-millimeter ammunition for the Leopard battle tank.Oath of disclosure for the current holdingsFor the first time, the confidential documents detail how empty the Bundeswehr's ammunition depots actually are. According to the accompanying letter from the Ministry of Finance, the \"earlier procurement is due to the changed security situation\" and serves \"the accelerated growth of the Bundeswehr's own stocks\". Due to the acute shortage of ammunition, it is therefore necessary to call up \"the maximum call-off quantity\" from the existing framework agreement with Rheinmetall.**The actual oath of disclosure, how blank the Bundeswehr actually is when it comes to ammunition, is almost unspectacular in the letter. The finance department reports that, according to the Bundeswehr, \u201cthe current stock of explosive projectiles in 155 mm caliber is around 20,000 pieces\u201d. However, due to current NATO requirements, the Bundeswehr must build up a stock of \"around 230,000 projectiles by 2031\". In other words: a good 190,000 shots are missing. The accelerated purchase of 155 bullets is \"absolutely necessary\", so the conclusion.**The background to the target numbers for the ammunition stocks are NATO specifications. These stipulate that the Bundeswehr must have sufficient artillery ammunition available by 2031 to be able to survive intensive combat for 30 days. So far, the ministry has refused to provide exact figures on ammunition stocks and the Bundeswehr's needs. It was even argued to parliamentarians that details about the exact ammunition stocks of the Bundeswehr would endanger the welfare of the state.The numbers that have now become known therefore allow now, for the first time, an assessment of how difficult Germany is likely to be with the NATO requirements. By 2031, procurers of artillery ammunition would have to replenish stocks with around 210,000 new shells; this would require purchasing around 30,000 rounds per year.Whether the industry is able to produce this amount is more than questionable. In addition, the Bundeswehr continuously uses ammunition during exercises, and possible further deliveries to Ukraine could further reduce the number of projectiles.The defense department also admits in the first submission that the plan for rapid procurement is quite risky. The figures now agreed for the annual ammunition purchases are \"significantly above the previous delivery capacity\", so there is \"the risk that the company cannot meet the specified delivery quantities\".\n\nMinistry warns of bottlenecks at ammunition manufacturersFor Minister Pistorius, ammunition procurement is likely to be one of the most important projects of his term of office. His predecessor, Christine Lambrecht, was rightly criticized for not speeding up the purchase of ammunition after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Beyond the political will, however, Pistorius is also heavily dependent on industry when it comes to procurement - especially since all the major military nations are currently trying to buy as many missiles as possible on the global market. The ministry sees the danger of bottlenecks in the armaments forges, \u201csince numerous other nations are procuring ammunition at the same time and the raw materials available are limited\u201d.T**he ammunition contracts that the ministry intends to submit to the committee contain, for the first time, what is known as a supply clause in the event of a crisis or war. In this way, the Bundeswehr wants to ensure its own supply of armaments if Germany's \"territorial security or alliance obligation\" is at risk. In this case, the industry is obliged in the contracts to accelerate its own production as much as possible. The example given is that the relevant factories should run 24 hours a day in such a case.**\n\n**-----------**\n\nGenghiswolves: *Seems like Germany went a bit greedy on those peace dividends.

Most protection schemes eventually get defeated, and the manufacturing industry has a very asinine approach to software- and firmware-writing which, in practice, means most of their software is trivial to break.\n\nControlling the export of manufacturing equipment is not easy, either. Manufacturing equipment, much like anything that doesn't have a GPS and a self-destruct mechanism, is out of your control once you've sold it. Once a piece of equipment is in Tianjin, it might as well be in Tolyatti, and while you might convince *some* manufacturers of super high-end equipment (think EUV lithography) to play ball, trying to get manufacturers of equipment for massive industrial production not to sell their stuff in China or Brazil is a losing proposition.\n\nSemiconductors were the first thing most people thought of not because they were superficial but because the semiconductor industry already has a lot of strict supply chain control mechanisms in place, and already has some experience trying to keep their stuff away from some regimes -- with mixed success, but better than none.\n\nIMHO it's not impossible to degrade Russian industrial capabilities, but there is no one single measure that will cause a catastrophic failure, either.

So while Galeev is probably right to point out that sanctioning just a small part of the supply chain isn't going to have that much of an effect, and that sanctioning other parts of the supply chain might make things even harder, sanctioning exports of CNC equipment and software alone isn't going to cause the Russian defense industry to buckle.\n\nThere are faster ways around it but at this point lots of people in the West aren't gonna like it: at this point, we're reaping the results of very questionable economic decisions made starting with the mid-eighties or so. At that time, Western companies, in their neverending quest for new markets and cheaper production, began selling all sorts of useful things and employing people everywhere, including to ideologically-committed enemies of their countries. In these thirty years, they've provided enough equipment and built enough expertise overseas that even if they were to suddenly stop *all* exports, of *any* kind, it would still take some time for the ball to drop.\n\nSevering supply chains is faster but it can't be done on a purely commercial basis, it needs to be a government-level thing, and it has to go further than merely prohibiting commercial contracts, it needs to take the form of prohibiting commercial *means*. No Russian ships docking in the ports of NATO countries, no payments on behalf of Russian companies, no financial withdrawals for Russian citizens, no entry of Russian vehicles in the EU, no EU transport licenses for companies that operate in Russia as well.\n\nIt's a tough step to take, though, because swathes of Western politicians have built their careers on money from donors they've encouraged -- and helped -- to build very lucrative partnerships with companies from countries like Russia, China, or even Iran, thinking, for some inexplicable reason, that when Russian, Chinese or Iranian politicians insist their mission in life is to bring the West to its knees, they were just showing off.

For instance, just prohibiting Russian ships is far from sufficient. With the way modern global shipping is configured, governments enforcing these restrictions would need to track the registration and ownership of the vessels through other countries like Panama to even figure out if they're Russian. If this tracking cannot be carried out well enough to seriously impact Russian trade, then all outgoing commercial shipping would need to be closely inspected, which would incur a significant shipping costs and delays.\n\n> thinking, for some inexplicable reason, that when Russian, Chinese or Iranian politicians insist their mission in life is to bring the West to its knees, they were just showing off.\n\nThe late 80s was largely just the EEC and (the negotiation of) NAFTA.

For instance, just prohibiting Russian ships is far from sufficient. With the way modern global shipping is configured, governments enforcing these restrictions would need to track the registration and ownership of the vessels through other countries like Panama to even figure out if they&#39;re Russian.

I'm guessing AFU initial plan simply failed, defenses were better than anticipated but they were smart enough not to push recklessly with their entire force in hope to luck it out somehow.

Yet after a week of hard fighting British defences start unravelling; culminating in the fall of Tobruk two weeks later.\n\nSimilarly a increasingly revered General, William Slim and his successful defensive battle in Imphal was nearly unhinged by a unexpected Japanese thrust into Kohima. Which had the Japanese pushed further in Kohima, would've likely reached Fourteenth Army's supply hub at Dimapur. Which Slim in his memoirs makes quite clear was a close run thing were it not for:\n\n>Major-General Sato, commander of the Japanese 31st Division, was, without exception, the most unenterprising of all the Japanese generals I encountered. He had been ordered to take Kohima and dig in. His bullet head was filled with one idea only\u2014to take Kohima. It never struck him that he could inflict terrible damage on us without taking Kohima at all. Leaving a small force to contain it, and moving by tracks to the east of Warren\u2019s brigade at Nichugard, he could, by the 5th April, have struck the railway with the bulk of his division.

Perhaps we assumed that units that had been on the line all winter were worn out and depleted, not to be relied upon.  That\u2019s probably true for units like the 3rd and5th assault or the 93rd mech, which bore the brunt of the Bakmut fighting, but there are ~30 RA brigades which spent a relatively quiet winter. What\u2019s more, a number of them have been disappearing from the line over the last couple weeks, some going into area reserve and some disappearing completely from the quality of deployment maps available to such as I.

Field breaching is going to be a slower affair than hoped, involving line charges , less crucial vehicles need to provide the covering force and recovery vehicles need to be an integral part of the task force.  \n\nTwo other big cons have shown up. First, artillery counter battery needs to step up its game, big time. Every time Ukraine pushes into a town, they give Russia a pre designated fire zone, and Ukrainian artillery is too far back to effectively respond.

Russian attack helos are having a field day. Ka 52s are one of the few platforms Russia possesses with good optics and munitions which can track further than manpads.

A destroyed vehicle on a black and white gun cam typically doesn't get counted (on either side) because there's no aftermath footage, and therefore no way to know if the targeted vehicle is damaged or destroyed.

The Oryx team absolutely follows pro-Ru accounts and it accepts submissions so long as they meet their criteria. Most Ru footage doesn't however, as you noted and as I explained previously. \n\nFor example Ru accounts love to post FPV drone videos these days, but they rarely show the aftermath footage which could help determine the status of the targeted vehicle (likely because they aren't flattering).
