It&#39;s still 65 km south of Kostyantynivka, which is 32 km south of Kramatorsk, which is 9 km south of Sloviansk, which all have to be taken for the Russians to accomplish their goals for this campaign. Is the CAA involved expected to be able to attack north for over a hundred kilometers to cut UAF supply lines? That&#39;s impossible, they might as well as add Kyiv as an objective. A hundred thousand arty rounds and ten thousand casualties later they likely won&#39;t even come close to reaching Kostyantynivka.</p>\n</div>",

So they'll keep using tactics that have worked for them.\n\nBut the NW axis is what I'm talking about.  The izium bridgehead has been their focal point for literally 4 months.  In those 4 months, they made virtually no operational progress while by all accounts trying very hard and taking attrition in gear and troops.  Now after 4 months of it being a focal point, they're moving units off.  Either they didn't implement their consistent winning tactic there, or the tactic isn't consistently winning.  That's just one example where it didn't go down that way, probably because of a variety of factors.

Because in those examples, as you said, the Russians just kept concentrated firepower on SD until there was literally nothing left to defend and the Ukrainians were utterly routed.\n\nThat's... not quite how it went down in SD.  Once the reinforcements were sent in at the start of June, Russian advances in the city almost froze.  Sure, they hammered them hard with artillery and as you've said and will say again the casualties endured were unacceptable, but at the end of the day, the Ukrainian force's mission - *keep a foothold in SD* - however bad or stupid you think it was - they accomplished it until they were given new orders.  Whereas in the other examples, those are cases where the force could not accomplish the mission and was destroyed and/or forced out on that battlefield, not due to external factors.\n\nThey occupied the industrial area until they were ordered to pull out due to a nearby area of front collapsing, at which point they quickly did so.  The battle of SD didn't end because Russian artillery destroyed the defenders and what they were defending - the size of the city and the fortification of the industrial zone prevented that having as much effect as in these microtowns like Pisky.  So they retreated not because of the situation in SD, but rather them being needed elsewhere in the front (partially because, as we established, they should have been elsewhere in the first place).\n\nThe result is very similar either way - the Ukrainians retreated, the mission was stupid, so usually I wouldn't bother making this distinction.

It's why I think it's possible for Russia to actually try and slug past the Donbas if every fight goes their way.  That being said, the volunteer battalions - they're more like volunteer companies, 200-300 people, and allegedly no vehicles (but I'm basing that last fact off one volunteer's social media post).\n\nAlso, one final note -\n\nIt's weird that for your examples regarding morale you compared the Germans and Japanese since honestly both nations fought pretty organizedly to the bitter end (the Japanese more so, due to their military culture).  I'm sure morale wasn't good but it held up enough for their cohesion as a fighting force to not be affected (at least not by morale, obviously attrition eventually bore them down).\n\nLike in absolute terms, both armies scored pretty high on the \"sustaining acceptable morale despite losing hard\" scale.

The troops likely fought as well as they could, but they were legitimately set up for failure by their operational and strategic level leadership. \n\nThink about this. Most of Severodonetsk was taken by the 1st of June. In reaction, they counterattack and make a short term recovery of part of the city. Then around the 8th the Zelensky admin decided to hype the battle to the extent that they publicly tied the fate of the entire campaign to a city that was already effectively lost. WTF was he thinking? What do you think that did to morale when the president of Ukraine is hyping a losing battle to overall victory, then followed by losing the city two weeks later, with the rest of Luhansk lost a week after that due to the bad decisions made earlier. \n\nThat's like if the family pet dog gets run over, broken back, in a coma, and dad is telling his kids in the vet waiting room that Fido is going to be fine and his speedy recovery will strengthen the family. No shit the shock is going to be greater for the kids when the vet gives the bad news that Fido needs to be put to sleep. \n\nZelensky caused that morale crash, in addition to causing the actual loss too.  \n\n>If Avdiivka with its reputation for being impossibly fortified falls\n\nThere should be no such reputation, and that's the problem. Anyone competent in military matters knows that everything falls eventually. Avdiivka has no value to even make it worth holding indefinitely, so pumping its value up only because it's the latest threat to being lost is the mistake. \n\nDo you know what its value actually is? It held the Russians back for x amount of time and helped achieve y number of Russian casualties. If z, the number of Ukraine losses to hold it long enough to do x and y is of greater value than x and y, then losing Avdiivka is a legit loss. However, z is of less value than x and y, then it was a victory despite losing it. \n\nThen it's just a matter of explaining that to the masses, which is easy. You say \"we're doing a defense in depth\" and that explains it, and suddenly it makes sense to retreat. It lost its tactical and operational value, and if has any strategic or political value then add it to the other 20% of their country they need to take back when Russia is weakened to the point that's possible.\n\n>Severodonetsk was a poor attribution of resources and caused significant casualties - but it wasn't quite like Popasna or Rubizhe\n\nYou're right about not being like Popasna, which held out from Feb 24 to early May. Severodonetsk was first assaulted in late and the UAF defenders were driven to the western edge within a week.\n\n>Once the reinforcements were sent in at the start of June, Russian advances in the city almost froze. \n\nThey didn't freeze, the Russians were actually pushed back to at least the city center. Which lasted for another week until the UAF got pushed back to the western edge. \n\n>but at the end of the day, the Ukrainian force's mission - keep a foothold in SD - however bad or stupid you think it was - they accomplished it until they were given new orders.\n\nI'm not faulting the UAF at the tactical level. My beef is with the senior level assholes wearing stars or suits. They fucked up.\n\n>So they retreated not because of the situation in SD\n\nThat's not true. They pulled out of Severodonetsk because the bridges leading to it were blown up. The retreat occurred a week later, the amount of time it likely took for Zelensky to make his decision and to organize it.\n\n>but rather them being needed elsewhere in the front (partially because, as we established, they should have been elsewhere in the first place).\n\nThey were needed elsewhere in early to mid May. Because they weren't in those places that mattered that's why the UAF lost Luhansk oblast.\n\n>It's why I think it's possible for Russia to actually try and slug past the Donbas if every fight goes their way\n\nIMO, the UAF would have to fuck up far worse than they ever have to lose the rest of Donetsk oblast. \n\n\n\n>It's weird that for your examples regarding morale you compared the Germans and Japanese since honestly both nations fought pretty organizedly to the bitter end\n\nI was using an example of planning comparisons to show how different choices in strategic and operational goals can affect morale and judging success. \n\nThe manner in which the UAF decided to fight in the Donbas was not the only way they could have done it, nor was it a wise decision. At best it was the most sentimental decision. And they paid for that. Hopefully Zelensky learned his lesson.",

The troops likely fought as well as they could, but they were legitimately set up for failure by their operational and strategic level leadership. </p>\n\n<p>Think about this. Most of Severodonetsk was taken by the 1st of June. In reaction, they counterattack and make a short term recovery of part of the city. Then around the 8th the Zelensky admin decided to hype the battle to the extent that they publicly tied the fate of the entire campaign to a city that was already effectively lost. WTF was he thinking? What do you think that did to morale when the president of Ukraine is hyping a losing battle to overall victory, then followed by losing the city two weeks later, with the rest of Luhansk lost a week after that due to the bad decisions made earlier. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s like if the family pet dog gets run over, broken back, in a coma, and dad is telling his kids in the vet waiting room that Fido is going to be fine and his speedy recovery will strengthen the family. No shit the shock is going to be greater for the kids when the vet gives the bad news that Fido needs to be put to sleep. </p>\n\n<p>Zelensky caused that morale crash, in addition to causing the actual loss too.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Avdiivka with its reputation for being impossibly fortified falls</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There should be no such reputation, and that&#39;s the problem. Anyone competent in military matters knows that everything falls eventually. Avdiivka has no value to even make it worth holding indefinitely, so pumping its value up only because it&#39;s the latest threat to being lost is the mistake. </p>\n\n<p>Do you know what its value actually is? It held the Russians back for x amount of time and helped achieve y number of Russian casualties. If z, the number of Ukraine losses to hold it long enough to do x and y is of greater value than x and y, then losing Avdiivka is a legit loss. However, z is of less value than x and y, then it was a victory despite losing it. </p>\n\n<p>Then it&#39;s just a matter of explaining that to the masses, which is easy. You say &quot;we&#39;re doing a defense in depth&quot; and that explains it, and suddenly it makes sense to retreat. It lost its tactical and operational value, and if has any strategic or political value then add it to the other 20% of their country they need to take back when Russia is weakened to the point that&#39;s possible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Severodonetsk was a poor attribution of resources and caused significant casualties - but it wasn&#39;t quite like Popasna or Rubizhe</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re right about not being like Popasna, which held out from Feb 24 to early May. Severodonetsk was first assaulted in late and the UAF defenders were driven to the western edge within a week.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once the reinforcements were sent in at the start of June, Russian advances in the city almost froze. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They didn&#39;t freeze, the Russians were actually pushed back to at least the city center. Which lasted for another week until the UAF got pushed back to the western edge. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>but at the end of the day, the Ukrainian force&#39;s mission - keep a foothold in SD - however bad or stupid you think it was - they accomplished it until they were given new orders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not faulting the UAF at the tactical level. My beef is with the senior level assholes wearing stars or suits. They fucked up.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So they retreated not because of the situation in SD</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s not true. They pulled out of Severodonetsk because the bridges leading to it were blown up. The retreat occurred a week later, the amount of time it likely took for Zelensky to make his decision and to organize it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>but rather them being needed elsewhere in the front (partially because, as we established, they should have been elsewhere in the first place).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They were needed elsewhere in early to mid May. Because they weren&#39;t in those places that mattered that&#39;s why the UAF lost Luhansk oblast.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s why I think it&#39;s possible for Russia to actually try and slug past the Donbas if every fight goes their way</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>IMO, the UAF would have to fuck up far worse than they ever have to lose the rest of Donetsk oblast. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s weird that for your examples regarding morale you compared the Germans and Japanese since honestly both nations fought pretty organizedly to the bitter end</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was using an example of planning comparisons to show how different choices in strategic and operational goals can affect morale and judging success. </p>\n\n<p>The manner in which the UAF decided to fight in the Donbas was not the only way they could have done it, nor was it a wise decision. At best it was the most sentimental decision. And they paid for that. Hopefully Zelensky learned his lesson.</p>\n</div>",

A lot of ppl risen from poverty could slink back.</p>\n\n<p>Low energy - see war un Ukraine, the costs is going up and while they get a lot of discounts it is getting higher.</p>\n\n<p>Cheap labor is probably still their strongest suite but automation is starting to eat into its relative value and their population is going to shrink significantly with their largest generation ever going to retierment.</p>\n\n<p>All these compound with their top-down control not being the best tonaddress this many different issues effectively (it has many other aspects that are better then what democracies use, like they can act very fast)</p>\n\n<p>So, Inwould say they are going to be hit hard by the current/upcoming recession.</p>\n\n<p>Also dont forget, thise GDP reports are not counting inflation. High inflation can actually pump thise numbers. If you calculate with inflation, in reality all countries is going to shrink relatively speaking</p>\n</div>",

That's more than just Taiwan and the Five Eyes, that's Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Malayasia, hell even Mongolia.

There were meetings in Russia in November between US officials and Putin asking him not to invade because the US knew and was keyed in long before it happened.  </p>\n\n<p>As for China and Taiwan, you cannot launch a snap invasion of the magnitude required to take Taiwan. You just can&#39;t do it. It&#39;s logistically impossible. And every intelligence agency with skin in the game is watching this like a hawk I&#39;m sure. That&#39;s more than just Taiwan and the Five Eyes, that&#39;s Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Malayasia, hell even Mongolia. All of them have an interest in keeping an eye on a Taiwan invasion and some of them have an interest in making sure the US knows about said invasion. And even if they don&#39;t everyone who knows makes it more likely that the US will know. Nothing happens in a vacuum these days.</p>\n</div>",

Taiwan is not a self sufficient country, if China could pull off a complete naval blockade it would be devastating to Taiwan. If those two goals are met, then China will send their tanks and their soldiers.</p>\n</div>",

It drives little economic rent but does make a lot of jobs. It\u2019s unreal - if you\u2019ve been to Shenzhen, you\u2019d have seen it\u2019s nothing like anything else in the world for that.\n\n2) if mainland China also had control of high end electronics, they\u2019d be able to drive rents across that ecosystem and also coerce behavior as global productivity growth is somewhat dependent upon ever improving high end electronics, and those rents aggregate to us companies. This would come at the expense of hardware brand companies like Apple and software companies as well eventually. Tsm does extract some of this, but I think more would be extracted if integrated into the large commodity electronics landscape of China. \n\n3) replacement won\u2019t happen in a chip bill. It\u2019s a decades long process and we aren\u2019t training the right people.

Basically China is importing a lot more Russian commodities but exporting fewer products to Russia, mainly, again, out of fear of western retaliation. \n\nBy far the strongest part of the sanctions on Russia is export controls - as Russia depends on a lot of foreign products to keep its economy going, the goal is to eventually choke the Russian economy by denying it access to those imports. You\u2019re already seeing the impact of sanctions in industrial production (i believe the Yale paper talks about that in depth), iirc Russia eg also imports something like 75% of its retail consumer products (not sure of the source for that anymore, might be the Yale paper again), so the export restrictions will be felt there as well. Basically Russia is highly dependent on imports, and its import shipments [are down 60%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-19/bis-chief-sees-us-allies-russia-sanctions-work-as-china-option). That will continue taking its toll on the Russian economy in the near future as inventories decline and companies are forced to reduce production, hike prices or even shut down completely. \n\nOne further thing id argue is that China doesn\u2019t directly respond to outside pressure in kind. When the Trump administration stepped up the pressure with trade tariffs for example, China became more conciliatory. When Biden came in and initially seemed reluctant to continue the aggressive trade policy of the Trump years (especially towards western allies) China felt emboldened to support Russia. When the west ramped up sanctions pressure on Russia and on China to comply with sanctions, China mostly bowed again. So i believe the public Chinese reaction to heightened tensions with the west might be martial in public and in the media, but in the geopolitical sphere China will seek to appease the west, because they\u2019re not willing to risk their economic relations with the west - at least not yet.",

They also need that economy to be militarily competitive - look at Russia as an example of a country trying to be a military power without that economy to support it.</p>\n\n<p>I would actually say that China has been surprisingly unsupportive of Russia. For example, their companies are not helping Russia circumvent the sanctions for fear of being hit by the sanctions as well. They are certainly happy to buy cheap Russian oil now that it&#39;s available at a discount, but that&#39;s being an opportunist, not a friend.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, we shouldn&#39;t expect their support for Russia to increase. They were already incentivized to support Russia to the extent it didn&#39;t cost them anything. They now are still incentivized to support Russia to the extent it doesn&#39;t cost them anything.
