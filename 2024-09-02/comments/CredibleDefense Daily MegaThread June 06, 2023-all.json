However, speaking from a strictly European perspective, the destruction of the dam is an important change IMHO.\n\nTo start with down-to-earth concerns, there's a matter of legitimate security concerns for NATO members. The Pruth, for instance, flows through Ukraine, and then between Ukraine and Romania, then Moldova and Romania. The Tisza flows through Ukraine and Hungary. If destroying dams on the Dnieper is okay, what about dams on the other rivers? The effects wouldn't be spectacular -- most of the tributaries of these rivers are downstream from where they enter NATO territory/form NATO borders, and the areas on the immediate Ukrainian borders aren't very densely populated, but \"just a couple of villages\" is still people.\n\nHowever, there's also a problem of a different kind. Europe has had its share of demons post-World War II. We've dealt with terrible, state-inflicted atrocities East of the Iron Curtain, unarmed civilians stood in front of Soviet tanks in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, then later on in the Baltics, we've dealt with the bloodbath of the Yugoslav wars. All of them were destructive, especially the first and the last.\n\nBut events of this scale and carried out through these means are not something most Eastern Europeans -- probably most Europeans, for that matter -- would regard as being in the same league as, say, the Kramatorks railway station attack, even though they're both horrible, unjustifiable war crimes.\n\nFor some folks in the West, there is a great deal of, if not outright shame, at least doubt about indiscriminate dam bombings like those of Operation Chastise. It's not unheard of after World War II -- the JNA tried to blow up Peruca Dam in 1993 and Borislav Djukic, the general who came up with this bright idea, was eventually extradited to Croatia (I think he's being retried after having been convicted the first time around). But it's uncommon, and when it happened, it was not something everyone contended with easily. \n\nThen for their counterparts in the East, it brings back uncomfortable memories, not just from the past wars, but also, for example, from back when various Moscow-sponsored regimes (or, ironically, in the case of Nova Kakhovka, the *Moscow* regime) forcefully displaced people for various infrastructure projects -- like hydroelectric plants -- and flooded vast areas in the name of industrialization and \"closing the gap\" with evil capitalist economies. On the one hand, sure, can't argue again industrialization; but on the other hand entire communities were scattered, the cultural heritage of an entire generation was destroyed, and -- in more practical terms -- thousands of people were left without their homes and found themselves forcefully relocated to -- at best -- cramped apartments in cities where they didn't know anyone and couldn't support themselves.\n\nThis kind of stunt is not just uncomfortably halfway between military action and terrorism, it's also uncomfortably close to the kind of stuff European countries would've done to each other eighty years ago, and it took a lot of effort to keep that from happening again, and it wasn't always successful. There's a substantial fear that releasing that kind of demon from the European past is a very bad idea, and that allowing one country to pop the cap and release the evil genie from that bottle will eventually cause everyone to pop theirs up, too.",

You don't want additional rainfall upstream to hit you when you have a full reservoir and all the floodable channels and flow sections upstream already flooded.

A Kremlin-affiliated milblogger reported that Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations in the area of Novodarivka (15km southwest of Velyka Novosilka), Rivnopil (11km southwest of Velyka Novosilka), and Neskuchne (2km south of Velyka Novosilka).[68] Russian \u201cVostok\u201c volunteer battalion commander Alexander Khodakovsky claimed that Russian forces recaptured Novodonetske (12km southeast of Velyka Novosilka) on June 6 after Ukrainian forces nearly liberated the entire settlement on June 5.[69] Russian milbloggers later claimed that Ukrainian forces regained positions on the northern outskirts of Novodonetske.[70] Some milbloggers claimed that Russian forces have not yet recaptured Neskuchne and that Ukrainian forces established a foothold in the area of Novodarivka.[71] A Russian source also claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully attempted to conduct offensive operations on the northern outskirts of Urozhaine (9km south of Velyka Novosilka).[72] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces unsuccessfully attacked in the direction of Novosilka (10km west of Velyka Novosilka).[73] Ukrainian Defense Forces Tavriisk Direction Spokesperson Captain Valeriy Shershen stated that Russian forces are continuing defensive operations in the Novopavlivka and Orikhiv operational directions in Zaporizhia and western Donetsk oblasts.[74</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-6-2023\">https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-6-2023</a></p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Russia has apparently been buying back weapons components that it previously sold to Burma and India. It seems unsurprising, however I haven't seen it reported before. The article is paywalled so here it is:\n\n---    \n\nTOKYO -- Russia is suspected of buying back military supplies previously shipped to Myanmar and India, according to a Nikkei analysis of customs clearance data.\n\nThe survey found records of Russian repurchases of parts for tanks and missiles that had been exported to Myanmar and India. Russia may be reimporting the components to improve older weapons destined for use in Ukraine, relying on help from countries with which it has long-standing military ties.\n\nThe survey found records of Russian repurchases of parts for tanks and missiles that had been exported to Myanmar and India. Russia may be reimporting the components to improve older weapons destined for use in Ukraine, relying on help from countries with which it has long-standing military ties.\n\nThe U.S., European nations and Japan have banned exports of goods with potential military use to Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.\n\nNikkei analyzed customs clearance data on shipments to Russia made available by ImportGenius, an American research specialist, Exim Trade Data of India and other sources, examining records on Russia's imports of parts for weapons such as tanks and missiles.\n\nUralVagonZavod, which manufactures tanks for the Russian military, for example, imported military products from the Myanmar army for $24 million on Dec. 9, 2022. The components were registered as having been made by UralVagonZavod.\n\nThe harmonized system (HS) codes for the reimported goods suggest the company repurchased **6,775 sighting telescopes and 200 cameras for installation in tanks.** They are \"probably optical devices to measure distance to targets and zero in on them,\" said Nobuyuki Akatani, a retired senior officer from the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force who was involved in developing tanks.\n\nRussia has an inventory of around 5,000 tanks, according to the 2023 edition of \"The Military Balance,\" an annual report published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think tank.\n\n\"Russia has a lot of old T-72s [tanks] in storage that are in need of modernization and could be sent to the front line afterwards,\" said Oleg Ignatov, a Russia analyst with the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. \"I can add that optics is a big problem for the Russian military-industrial complex. It's plausible that they are trying to get optics this way.\"\n\nRussia, which previously relied on Western technology to produce optical equipment, according to past trade data, appears to be struggling to procure the necessary components as a result of the trade sanctions.\n\nNikkei asked UralVagonZavod, the Russian government and the Defense Ministry of Myanmar's military regime to provide details on the Russian company's repurchase of military products, but received no replies as of publication.\n\nReference to \"imported under reclamation act\" was found in the customs clearance data. UralVagonZavod exported military products to the Myanmar army in 2019; the reference suggests the returned items were defective.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Russia has apparently been buying back weapons components that it previously sold to Burma and India. It seems unsurprising, however I haven&#39;t seen it reported before. The article is paywalled so here it is:</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>TOKYO -- Russia is suspected of buying back military supplies previously shipped to Myanmar and India, according to a Nikkei analysis of customs clearance data.</p>\n\n<p>The survey found records of Russian repurchases of parts for tanks and missiles that had been exported to Myanmar and India. Russia may be reimporting the components to improve older weapons destined for use in Ukraine, relying on help from countries with which it has long-standing military ties.</p>\n\n<p>The survey found records of Russian repurchases of parts for tanks and missiles that had been exported to Myanmar and India. Russia may be reimporting the components to improve older weapons destined for use in Ukraine, relying on help from countries with which it has long-standing military ties.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S., European nations and Japan have banned exports of goods with potential military use to Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Nikkei analyzed customs clearance data on shipments to Russia made available by ImportGenius, an American research specialist, Exim Trade Data of India and other sources, examining records on Russia&#39;s imports of parts for weapons such as tanks and missiles.</p>\n\n<p>UralVagonZavod, which manufactures tanks for the Russian military, for example, imported military products from the Myanmar army for $24 million on Dec. 9, 2022. The components were registered as having been made by UralVagonZavod.</p>\n\n<p>The harmonized system (HS) codes for the reimported goods suggest the company repurchased <strong>6,775 sighting telescopes and 200 cameras for installation in tanks.</strong> They are &quot;probably optical devices to measure distance to targets and zero in on them,&quot; said Nobuyuki Akatani, a retired senior officer from the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force who was involved in developing tanks.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has an inventory of around 5,000 tanks, according to the 2023 edition of &quot;The Military Balance,&quot; an annual report published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a British think tank.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Russia has a lot of old T-72s [tanks] in storage that are in need of modernization and could be sent to the front line afterwards,&quot; said Oleg Ignatov, a Russia analyst with the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. &quot;I can add that optics is a big problem for the Russian military-industrial complex. It&#39;s plausible that they are trying to get optics this way.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Russia, which previously relied on Western technology to produce optical equipment, according to past trade data, appears to be struggling to procure the necessary components as a result of the trade sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>Nikkei asked UralVagonZavod, the Russian government and the Defense Ministry of Myanmar&#39;s military regime to provide details on the Russian company&#39;s repurchase of military products, but received no replies as of publication.</p>\n\n<p>Reference to &quot;imported under reclamation act&quot; was found in the customs clearance data. UralVagonZavod exported military products to the Myanmar army in 2019; the reference suggests the returned items were defective. But according to Kinichi Nishimura, a military analyst who previously served at Japan&#39;s Ministry of Defense, &quot;Any defective products should have been replaced when discovered in a full inspection conducted at the time of import.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Other analysts agree: &quot;For a warranty return, this would, as far as I know, be an unusual quantity,&quot; said Jakub Janovsky of Oryx, a Dutch defense intelligence analysis website.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian NPK KBM, the Russian initials for the Machine-Building Design Bureau, which is tasked with missile production, purchased a total of <strong>six components for night-vision sight for ground-to-air missiles for $150,000 from the Indian Ministry of Defense in August and November 2022.</strong> All of the parts, which are needed to ensure the missiles can perform at night and in low light, were manufactured by the KBM, which exported the same type of parts to India in February 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Russia may have reimported the parts for repairs, but there were no records of the items being sent back to India as of the end of March this year.

Would not be surprising if FSB also got their hands on who knows what secret document that still have not been made public.  Or maybe WaP just better and quicker and this story is revelation to Kremlin.  Who knows.</p>\n</div>",
