Maybe a little bit of it is trying to play both sides of the conflict for profit depending on who wins, but I think ultimately Lukashenko knows it's Russia who pays his bills.

You're just looking at real, which adjusts way too generously for inflation on a currency translation basis, especially because the argument is that the entire point of sanctions is to boost inflation and make basic goods inaccessible.

        "body": "I have a question in regards to the USN's ability to interdict the PLAN in case of a war in Taiwan. \n\nIn such a scenario the PLAN would likely deploy the vast majority of its naval assets to the Taiwan Strait. Yes, some assets might be diverted to the East China Sea and South China Sea, but I don't think anyone would disagree that the vast majority of the PLAN's 68 submarines, 50'ish destroyers, 40'ish frigates and 72 corvettes would operate in the strait, as well as their 3 carriers and 3 light carriers (the Type 075 is larger than the Izumo class, and more or less equal in displacement compared to the America/Wasp class). The amount of vessels the PLAN can devote to such an invasion will also only likely increase over the course of the decade, e.g. the Type 055 Destroyer, similar to the Ticonderoga class, saw 5 ships launch in the past 2 years. \n\nWhilst no one is going to argue about the USN's global supremacy and superiority, what would matter in this war is the forces one can deploy at short notice to Taiwan. Naval superiority over the strait needs to be contested, as well as aerial supremacy over Taiwan itself. \n\nHowever, at the moment, the only forces the USN has in the region is the 7th Fleet consisting of one CSG (1 carrier + 3 Ticonderoga) and one destroyer squadron (7 Arleigh Burke). This is obviously not enough by a long shot to attempt to engage the PLAN. Of the USN's 8 other CSGs, 4 are stationed on the West Coast and three at Norfolk on the East. It will probably take a San Diego CSG at least 2-3 weeks to deploy to Taiwan, with the Norfolk ones probably closer to 4-5. \n\nChina will know that it's success will depend on an element of surprise, and aim to reduce to a minimum the amount of time it would take western intelligence to realise it is planning a serious assault. It has the benefit that the infrastructure in e.g. Fujian province is excellent, and most of its surface ships transit the strait on a regular basis anyway. Many of its preparations could be made without raising suspicion. \n\nSo after my long ramble, finally my question: why does the USN not forward deploy more CSGs to the West Pacific? Why are e.g. not two CSGs moved to Pearl Harbour, Sasebo, Kure or Guam?",

                            "body": "Any radar system can frequency hop if designed to do so, it isn't limited by antenna type. It was one the first things implemented in electronic warfare, as if say a active-radar homing anti-ship missile only operates on a single frequency, the ship can just transmit that frequency back at the missile(jamming). The job of the AN/SLQ-32 in the US Navy. If the missile operates on a spectrum of four frequencies, then a method can be implemented to jam all four frequencies. Just kinda of accelerates from there into the *happy world* of RF engineering and the associated ECM and ECCM.\n\nPESA radar eliminates mechanical scanning in elevation or azimuth, and instead features dozens, hundreds, or thousands of individual elements connected to a single transmitter and typically one receiver. By delaying the signal(phase shifting) to different elements, or arrays of elements, the array can be electronically steered. The system can still change frequencies, within the limitation of the design of the system. \n\nAESA implements receivers and/or transmitters for each element or array of elements. Steering is done in the same method, via phase shifting, but AESA radars can operate multiple frequencies at the same time across the array. \n\nBoth systems can be used to implement things like being able to track one more targets while still searching, or being able to illuminate one or more targets while searching and tracking. Although how that works is just pure RF magic in my world. I prefer digital logic where there is a lot less trigonometry and dark magic. Regardless every active radar system emits electromagnetic radiation, which can be detected further away than the radar itself works, as the signal only has to travel in one path instead of bouncing off a object and returning. Doing frequency hopping is a good way to avoid electronic jamming, as implementing transmitter that can work across multiple frequencies is more difficult than just implementing a receiver. For something like a counter battery radar it emits radiation as long as it is on, building a receiver that operates on a wide range of frequencies, like X-band(8Ghz-12Ghz), isn't that difficult to do.",

It was one the first things implemented in electronic warfare, as if say a active-radar homing anti-ship missile only operates on a single frequency, the ship can just transmit that frequency back at the missile(jamming). The job of the AN/SLQ-32 in the US Navy. If the missile operates on a spectrum of four frequencies, then a method can be implemented to jam all four frequencies. Just kinda of accelerates from there into the <em>happy world</em> of RF engineering and the associated ECM and ECCM.</p>\n\n<p>PESA radar eliminates mechanical scanning in elevation or azimuth, and instead features dozens, hundreds, or thousands of individual elements connected to a single transmitter and typically one receiver. By delaying the signal(phase shifting) to different elements, or arrays of elements, the array can be electronically steered. The system can still change frequencies, within the limitation of the design of the system. </p>\n\n<p>AESA implements receivers and/or transmitters for each element or array of elements. Steering is done in the same method, via phase shifting, but AESA radars can operate multiple frequencies at the same time across the array. </p>\n\n<p>Both systems can be used to implement things like being able to track one more targets while still searching, or being able to illuminate one or more targets while searching and tracking. Although how that works is just pure RF magic in my world. I prefer digital logic where there is a lot less trigonometry and dark magic. Regardless every active radar system emits electromagnetic radiation, which can be detected further away than the radar itself works, as the signal only has to travel in one path instead of bouncing off a object and returning. Doing frequency hopping is a good way to avoid electronic jamming, as implementing transmitter that can work across multiple frequencies is more difficult than just implementing a receiver. For something like a counter battery radar it emits radiation as long as it is on, building a receiver that operates on a wide range of frequencies, like X-band(8Ghz-12Ghz), isn&#39;t that difficult to do.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I want to make a post about the Zaporizhia power plant. I have seen some comments doubting the allegations that Russia is planning some sort of nuclear shenanigans in the power plant, by stating that this would have no benefits to Russia, \"makes no sense to irradiate your own troops and the land you want to annex by blowing up a plant you want to use in the future\".\n\nI will offer a plausible/believable/non-impossible scenario in which Russia is targeting the Zaporizhia power plant in order to shape the environment for a Russian false-flag attack on the power plant to create a nuclear disaster that the Russian leadership could think would benefit Russia and would fit into Russian risk-reward calculations. I am not saying that the following scenario is likely, that it would happen nor that it would take place in this particular way. \n\n**The desired end-result of the operation:** force Ukraine to agree to a cease-fire, which would provide the possibility for Russia to freeze the war on current lines for any further political goal (annexation, formation of puppet states etc).\n\n**Execution and ideal scenario for Russia:** \n\n\\- Russia causes a \"limited\" nuclear disaster. Maybe blowing up some waste-fuel storage facility, some pipes carrying irradiated water etc. Really the source of leakage does not have to even come from the plant itself. Limited in the sense that it would cause legitimate threat and harm to wider population and be detected, but limited enough to be fixable. \n\n\\- Russia blames Ukraine on the attack. This is why the back-and-forth accusations are necessary, in order to create plausible deniability. A lot of people would surely say that it would have no benefit for Russia to blow up that power plant.\n\n\\- State that there is a massive nuclear threat and it needs to be fixed and cleaned up immediately, but it cannot be addressed as long as Ukraine keeps shelling the front-lines and attacking Russians in the rear. Have some nuclear engineers blown up in a \"partisan attack\". \n\n\\- Escalate the radiation leakage and escalate the threat (first it was just a burst water-pipe, but now there is no power for the cooling, back-up generators were destroyed). Make sure that the whole of Europe and NATO is in full panic mode. Stock markets in the west could easily afford another 20-30% drop in fear of nuclear Armageddon.\n\n\\- Demand that Ukraine agree to truce/cease-fire in order to stop the active nuclear disaster polluting Ukrainian land, air and people. Hope that Putinverstehers in the west would apply pressure Ukraine to agree to a \"temporary truce\".\n\n\\- If Ukraine agrees to pause combat activities, Russia won. Russia would reinforce and reorganize their defenses and then just be there. It will be geopolitically very difficult for Ukraine to then resume combat without Russia doing it first. \n\n\\- Tone down on the radiation and slowly fix the \"issues\". Problems can always be restarted if needed, easy to blame on some previously undiscovered damage.\n\n\\- World sighs a relief, Ukrainian troops have stopped dying, videos of combat and civilian deaths have stopped. War is over.\n\n**What if things don't go as planned:** what if Ukraine does not agree to pause fighting, if the Western response is not to pressure Ukraine as hoped, damage to western economy and politics is not as hoped?\n\nRussia could escalate the threat further, or they could just fix it (because it was controlled and limited) and keep pretending it was Ukraine's fault and Russia acted responsibly and valiantly and under a hail of Ukrainian fire saved the world from nuclear Armageddon. Doubters would say: \"see, why would Russia have blown up a nuclear plant they controlled and wanted to control, on the land they controlled and then FIXED IT? Surely it was Ukraine being stupid.\"\n\n**Disclaimers and further thoughts**\n\nRussia tries different avenues to achieve their goals and this could be one in a wider arsenal. I find it unlikely that Russia would go seriously down the route unless they are convinced they can't achieve success on the battlefield and unless other less-risky avenues (like let's see what happens in Europe in the winter with energy) have been tried. Russia could develop and open up the situation, without fully committing. They would also like to maintain options for de-escalating the operation if it does not work as intended.",

Yet foreign powers like Iran intervened against the will of the Syrian people and assisted Assad in massacring the Syrian population into submission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>sigh.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&#39;t supply soon-to-be-terrorists with weapons because we were fighting for their rights. We did it because we wanted assad out of power. Presumably to weaken russia.</p>\n\n<p>And again. By this logic the people of the donbas wanted independence and russia had nothing to do with it. I know for a fact you&#39;ll refuse to accept that. Don&#39;t make dishonest arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Almost everyone here holds completely contradictory positions based solely on which side <em>we are on</em>. It&#39;s so tiresome.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>WW1\nWW2\nKorea\n1st Gulf war\nSaving the Iraqis from ISIS\nSaving the Kurds from ISIS\nHelping Ukraine</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two of those happened before the international system. the next 3 were done under the UN and complied with international law. The last 2 are open for debate.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s exactly zero unilateral interventions that have succeeded?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Funny that you don&#39;t mind when Russian and Iranian intervention empirically make things worse in Syria and Iraq. But yet stand so vehemently against US saving Kurds from ISIS</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who says i don&#39;t mind?</p>\n\n<p>i&#39;m arguing about international law.</p>\n\n<p>and you just keep proving my point again and again that nobody gives a damn about it.

Maybe. \n\nHistorically the goal was almost always 'stop anyone veguely left leaning from getting into power'.  That normally involved overthrowing a government or supporting genocide or supporting death squads.

In many cases our efforts to 'subvert communism'  drove people into alignment with the Soviets.
