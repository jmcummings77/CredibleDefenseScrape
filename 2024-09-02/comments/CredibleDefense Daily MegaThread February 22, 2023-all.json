Therefore he's certain there's no large second Russian force waiting in the wings as some have claimed. \n\n* Kofman thinks Russian leadership will wait 1-2 months to see how well this offensive goes, and will then implement another round of mobilization afterwards to make up for losses and build out the force.

Looking at his resume, it's pretty scary he didn't know that. He's confusing Foreign Internal Defense (FID) with UW, and SF did FID but there weren't enough for the entire Iraqi and Afghanistan National Army, obviously. \n\nThey did Direct Action (DA) because raids were a major part of the GWOT and they're very hard to do, risky, and require high speed low drag dudes who can shoot, move, and communicate better than 18-22 years in Big Army, including the 82nd, who think marrying strippers and buying a new mustang at 21% APR are good ideas. \n\n>On this point Field Marshal William Slim, arguably the most successful British commander in that war, is worth quoting: \u201cThese formations, trained, equipped, and mentally adjusted for one kind of operation only, were wasteful.

We barely use conventional forces anymore because we don't need and the powers that be don't want to, because SOCOM are more trusted. \n\nThen the author lists a handful of screwups, as if perfection was otherwise except for SOCOM.

With SOCOM, nobody cares when they deploy, not even when they get killed, because so much is hidden, which gives incredible flexibility in their use, augmented because they're far more effective, far far far better trained than conventional forces.

Now they have to operate on the same terms as the rest of the Russian armed forces, Prigozhin is so salty about this that he is releasing pictures of Wagner KIA in one day in only one-location and statistics of ammo consumption and even calling in to radio shows describing how Wagner soldiers are dying in droves and calling for treason charges towards Russian officials ..this really gives you a idea of how much death Wagner have experienced capturing inches. One word: Insanity.</p>\n</div>",

The ships aren't being built simply because SK needs them. They're being built as a component of wider export-oriented industrial policy coordinated between the chaebols and the SK government, with the latter largely directing the country's finances. This is similar to the \"Window Guidance\" policy practiced by Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, and China has its own (albeit more heavy-handed and direct) implementation of this economic system.\n\n>So US is never going to have the raw shipbuilding capacity UNLESS maybe US gov't wants to have a state owned shipbuilding company that's money losing venture.\n\nWhat needs to happen is a major structural shift in the global economy because otherwise the US as a whole will go the way of GE.

The ships aren&#39;t being built simply because SK needs them. They&#39;re being built as a component of wider export-oriented industrial policy coordinated between the chaebols and the SK government, with the latter largely directing the country&#39;s finances. This is similar to the &quot;Window Guidance&quot; policy practiced by Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, and China has its own (albeit more heavy-handed and direct) implementation of this economic system.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So US is never going to have the raw shipbuilding capacity UNLESS maybe US gov&#39;t wants to have a state owned shipbuilding company that&#39;s money losing venture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What needs to happen is a major structural shift in the global economy because otherwise the US as a whole will go the way of GE. Yes, I understand the gravity of this prescription. However, offshoring the production of most of America&#39;s Navy is effectively long-term abdication of the US as a major power. The US will not survive as a global power if it becomes a continent of lawyers and MBAs.</p>\n</div>",

By your logic, Chinese have or will soon have the military naval production which will lead to them having naval strength over USN and will threaten the freedom of navigation for the global economy.

Now take that likelihood and multiply by it by the likelihood of an act of state sabotage large enough to be unprecedented in the modern era. </p>\n\n<p>People&#39;s desire for entertainment is overriding their common sense.</p>\n</div>",

In fact, RoK's far superior conventional military and DPRK's economy not being able to match that conventional military strength was why DPRK had to go nuke/ICBM route.\n\nSo what are Chinese actually gonna do about it if RoK were to go nuclear?  Put unilateral sanctions like US/RoK did to DPRK, probably.  But what else?  Are they gonna march down DMZ with Tanks rolling?  Don't think so.  Or will CCP drop nukes/missile on Seoul?  I seriously doubt it.  For the same reason RoK/USA didn't roll tanks north or drop missiles on test sites or plutonium production site BEFORE DPRK did nuclear tests was precisely because the likely reaction wasn't worth the trouble.  If Chinese were to do anything kinetic on RoK, you can bet RoK will respond with much better weapons than what DPRK can muster and that's not gonna be happy days for Beijing.  If CCP can live with nukes/ICBMs on its direct border not too far from Beijing, CCP will have to suck it up and live with RoK nukes.  BTW, a nuke is an excellent defensive weapon and not that good of an offensive weapon when you are not the only one who has them.

It also specifically said that Ukrainians are using team to squad sized outposts 100-250 meters in front of their platoon strongholds. A few months back I read that the Ukrainians were using elastic defense tactics and specifically cited their use of outpost lines, which are typically held by squads or platoons. \n\nIf true, that'll explain a lot of the issues. \n\nIf the Ukrainians are copying WW1 German elastic defense tactics, those are only useful against massed assaults trying to dramatically break through the entire line, but not against infiltration tactics doing limited attacks. \n\nThe way 1917 style elastic defense is supposed to work is outposts  serve as early warning to the main line of resistance, supposed to delay the attackers but NOT be decisively engaged before they retreat. Then the platoon to company sized strongholds are supposed to do the same, fight, delay, then retreat, and eventually the assault force tires itself out, at which point the mobile reserve is committed to counterattack to retake everything, and reset.\n\nBut what if the attackers can take the outpost line before it retreats? What if outposts are not even allowed to retreat without permission? And what happens if the attacker isn't trying to then advance in greater depth to the platoon stronghold or beyond but instead calls a limit of advance at the outpost lines, starts the consolidation, digs in, and readies itself for a counterattack? \n\nBite and Hold. Which was the WW1 British answer to trench warfare issues, instead of grand offensives trying to totally break through a German line in depth, advance through incremental gains that routinely push the enemy back. Take the forward line and stop, defeat the counterattack, reset.\n\nImagine that plan works. The UAF outpost lines are taken and the Russians dig in. Chances are they're doing this with EW jamming and lots of artillery support, so they're jamming all Motorola or Baofeng type radios that are commonly used by the UAF at the company level and under [like this](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/08FC/production/_128100320_1b304bc2-a122-4dea-aa24-d919e50219b2.jpg), and they're probably suppressing the platoon strongholds and other UAF units in the depth of their defenses. At some point, either the Ukrainian commanders try and fail to regain comms with the outpost lines (most of which were likely attackes en-masse) or they send a runner to check and they realize the Russians are there. \n\nWhat happens next? Probably the UAF platoon is ordered to counterattack, maybe the whole company. But if the Russians performed that assault properly it means they got the consolidation right, and they'd be expecting that counterattack, so might be able to repel the attack at high cost to the Ukrainians even, especially if they too still have responsive fires. \n\nAt that point that, unless a larger scale counterattack can be organized, the outpost line is now Russian territory. Which means if the Ukrainians remain using their elastic defense tactics, which would be dictated by higher commanders (the same one the Ukraine Twitter guy is complaining about), they have to move the platoon strongholds backwards, place new squad outposts on a new outpost line where the main line of resistance used to be, and shift everything back. \n\nThe problem with that is that micro-terrain and good cover, which is where defenses should be situated, won't be found on maps used by brigade command and staff or using formulas for distances between units. So the UAF end up poorly positioned, especially the isolated outposts who are going to be outnumbered again the next time they get attacked. And the next time after that. And after that...\n\nSo why not use full platoons in the outpost lines? Too costly to lose them? Not enough platoons? \n\nWhy not abandon the concept and just have a forward line with observation posts connected only a short distance away, 1915-6 style? \n\nBecause then they're back to 1915-6 when everyone was equally vulnerable to attack, any breakthrough can roll up the whole position. Not to mention very vulnerable to fire missions (which is the other reason to use outpost lines, they're sacrificial allowing the rest of the unit to essentially live in dugout while the outpost have to remain alert and scanning, which means vulnerable).\n\nThe Russians are learning. I bet these template assault aren't the cannon fodder ex-cons, these are probably the better tier troops, Wagner version of VDV, whereas the cannon fodder's job is recon in force, probing attacks to find all the new outposts, where the minefields are, where the covered and concealed avenues of advance are located, potential gaps, potential unit boundaries, etc. Because every time the Ukrainians retreat the positions totally change and the Russians would have to conduct extensive ground and aerial recon to find out where everything is, to then prep them for days or weeks with fires before another deliberate attack is planned and executed that won't be a disaster.",

Then another deliberate assault.\n\nThose are done in conjunction with prep fires to suppress the entire UAF defensive sector in depth plus left and right units. That covers the assault force as they move from the assembly area to the attack point. When those supporting fires lift, then the assault force picks up suppression with organic fires, RPGs and AGS-30, that covers actual assault teams as they maneuver within close combat range to physically overrun the defenses, then dig in to hold them against counterattack.\n\nWhat happens if that doesn't work?

And if the Ukrainians don't retreat, eventually the defenses will be degraded to a point that it won't matter if a fresh unit relieves them, the positions don't really exist anymore. At which point they retreat without a Russian assault even needed to actually push the UAF out (which seems to be what happened in Popasna itself back in early. May).\n\nNote, this needs EW to work. If Ukrainian drones catching the Russians advancing means they eat arty or mortars or whatever else before they can close the distance. If the Ukrainians can communicate under the company level using handheld radios, they can coordinate their defense. So likely the Russians have heavy and effective EW capabilities to support Bakhmut.

Also, don&#39;t bother coming back unless you&#39;ve achieved your mission orders or unless most of you are dead or wounded&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>It works well for pre-war Wagner, because most were veterans of Chechnya, Armenian, Georgia, and the Donbas. Those who were recruited after February, it&#39;s basically a coin toss: if you choose the correct tactics, and the situation is favorable, congrats. If your team/squad leaders suck, or the enemy is lucky and competent :(</p>\n</div>",

The F-23 was also a competitor in the F-22 program, its my understanding that most airframes that are seriously considered for production in these programs get a real F- designation.

Or perhaps Putin is twisting Xi&#39;s arm a bit by pressuring their &quot;unbounded friendship&quot; for aid now in return for aid in the future, and this is China reluctantly feeding their northern buddies a bit because Putin is putting in a loan with them that they have few expectations will ever see a return.</p>\n</div>",

It's worth pointing out that OSINT reports on battle casualties suffer from significant input-output problems - Ukrainians are unlikely to photograph their own losses while they are far more likely to photograph Russian ones.\n\nI am so tired of this critique. It\u2019s been a year. The gap between Russia and Ukraine is now 6k pieces of equipment.

People rated the Russians a whole lot higher until this Ukraine shitshow. </p>\n\n<p>I still can&#39;t shake the notion that using hard military force is the worst way of expanding influence. Seemed like the soft power approach they were using was a game-changer. What they were doing in Africa, like anti-colonialism where they are engaging in huge projects but letting some of the profits accumulate locally so it was win-win. Opposite of western colonialism and made them look like good-guy China. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, there&#39;s the counter-argument that a lot of those projects were bungled and will fall apart in the next decade and the deals are getting worse now. Pooh has squandered a lot of the goodwill accumulated. </p>\n\n<p>Hell, maybe they will try force projection. Just because it&#39;s a dumb idea doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t try it. Invading Ukraine was a manifestly stupid move and yet here we are.</p>\n</div>",

What Chinese is are doing in south china sea is very &quot;unpopular&quot; with everyone who has any claim anywhere near south china sea.  There are many other examples.</p>\n</div>",

The US's military power, its reach, its experience and its manufacturing capabilities are hard to beat on the world stage and the best way to see this in action is how Putin has been addressing the Ukraine war in the press: Putin/Russia always calls out the US/Biden personally whenever they want to make a point or try and sue for their bullshit peace. Putin is (rightly) afraid of the US putting more skin in the game than they already have because the US (unlike most of the EU/NATO) is more likely to scoff at their sabre rattling bullshit and jump into WWIII (which would be really, really bad for Russia) than the EU/NATO would ever be comfortable doing. This, also, is another *huge* reason why China has a vested interest in matching military might with the US long-term, no matter the cost---especially since so much of their ideology/platform is built on nationality/strength to continue their government's grip on power nationally, at the least.\n\nThe US and EU rejecting/ignoring China's 'peace plan' immediately is the only answer here. Because the main party that should be making that deal and being the ultimate 'gatekeeper' is Ukraine. To basically have Russia and China assume that the US and the EU are the only ones that matter here (while freezing Ukraine out completely) is basically why this deal is dead on arrival. If Zelenskyy is not allowed to make the final decision or even be allowed to the negotiating table for his own country's future then it would be no better than admitting to the world that the US/EU are the so-called 'wizards behind the curtain' in this conflict and thus, Ukraine's wishes don't/won't ever matter. It would diminish Ukraine so completely in terms of autonomy that it would basically label *all* smaller countries in the US/EU's spheres of influence mere pawns and nothing more. This, more than anything, would validate the bullshit China and Russia have been spouting for *decades* about how all the world's ills are all from the 'evil West' basically being puppetmasters of the world (which all have their roots in anti-Semitism/racism/cultural superiority). This would be free propaganda for these authoritarian fuckwits for *decades* to come and do nothing but validate their so-called paranoia/perceived victimization in perpetuity.\n\nEither way, *any* peace plan that China draws up will be largely skewed in Russia *and* China's favor long-term and is never to be trusted. Like I said: why trust both of them to ever keep their word when the past few decades have shown that, if it doesn't suit them, they will just ignore international treaties/agreements and face little to no repercussions for it (especially if they do it on the sly)? Both of them are the boys that cried wolf too many times, and this is the fallout from that behavior: nobody trusts them to keep their word and their worldwide meddling (especially in countries with democracies or burgeoning democracies) has left everyone distrusting their long-term intentions.\n\nRealistically, should the US 'vacate' the Baltics and hope that NATO will pick up the gauntlet when Russia and China come calling... well, let's just say that it would be essentially allowing Russia and China free-reign on those states and NATO's bark would have much, much less bite.
