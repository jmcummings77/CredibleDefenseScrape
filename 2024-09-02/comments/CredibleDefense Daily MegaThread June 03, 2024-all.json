Keep in mind even professional software developers consistently underestimate the complexity and timeline for new code. \n\nYou'd need an overall sensor shooter complex that could do something like take footage from an observation drone, and get high accuracy coordinates for the targets.

The federal debt limit is the most *current* problem, but it's not necessarily the biggest one overall. Also, let's recall that Union, SPD, AfD and FDP are against changes to the debt limit (though some have internal debate). That's 570 of 733 votes against changes, where a two thirds majority would be required. I wouldn't call that \"several parties\".\n\nEven if federal debt limit were to be changed, rearmament is slowly become politically contentious once again. Even without a debt limit, priorities have to be established. \n\nThe Green party leadership deserves great credit: They've pivoted very far from their pacifist roots in a short amount of time, though Baerbocks recent suggestion of a German military involvement in an international Gaza peacekeeping force maybe went a little far. But their base hasn't moved on these issues as much. There is a growing rift, as exemplified by the recent party debate around the EU asylum deal. I'm very curious to see where the party will go in the next few years, especially with the looming results of the EU elections.\n\nThe SPD seems to have fully committed to its double message, with the \"peace\" message becoming more important all the time. Scholz still constantly warns of the looming threat of a third world war based on weapon deliveries and his party is now openly campaigning as the party of peace. They're also in the process of freezing out and reigning in the most ardent Ukraine supporters in both the executive and legislature (Pistorius and Roth).\n\nThe debt limit is certainly the current hurdle, but I don't think rearmament is a forgone conclusion without it. I'm especially concerned about the growing sentiment surrounding sufficiency: \"The military force of Ukraine was enough to stop Russia, we only need to collectively recreate that in Europe and we're safe for a bargain price.\"\n\nWith major military analysts like Masala concluding that the Zeitenwende largely didn't succeed and political support for the military further cooling, I think the debt brake is also just a welcome fig leaf for some parties and politicians who oppose rearmament on ideological grounds.",

In the meantime, commanders are redeploying soldiers from rear positions to fighting units near the front. \n\n>Wherever the new soldiers come from, Ukrainian field commanders said that because training is so deficient, they must often devote weeks to teaching them basic skills, such as how to shoot.\n\n>We had guys that didn\u2019t even know how to disassemble and assemble a gun,\u201d said a 28-year-old deputy battalion commander from the 93d Mechanized Brigade, whom The Washington Post agreed to identify by his call sign, Schmidt, according to Ukrainian military protocol.\n\n>Schmidt said that he spent the first week with soldiers transferred from rear posts just making sure each one fire at least one box of bullets \u2014 some 1,500 shots \u2014 daily before moving on to more complex tasks.\n\n>...\n\n>To get more troops to the battlefield immediately, Zelensky\u2019s recently appointed military chief, Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, has redeployed people who were previously serving in jobs such as guarding bridges and other infrastructure far from the combat zone to brigades engaged in some of the fiercest fighting.\n\n>For front-line commanders, any new troops are welcome, given that some units have endured months without reinforcements. But many of these redeployed arrivals appear ill-prepared, commanders said, despite many having served in the military since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion more than two years ago, albeit far from the battlefield.\n\n>Until about a month ago, a Ukrainian soldier, whose call sign is Val, had been standing guard on a bridge in the southern Odessa region \u2014 the same job he\u2019d been doing every day since he enlisted at the start of the invasion.\n\n>On April 30, Val was told that he was being transferred to combat duty. Within 24 hours, he was assigned to the 93rd Brigade and instructed to deploy to the eastern Donetsk region. He didn\u2019t even have time to pack his things \u2014 some had to be shipped later.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d the 31-year-old said. \u201cNobody was really prepared.\u201d\n\n>For a reconnaissance unit in the 42nd Mechanized Brigade, which was recently redirected to the northeast Kharkiv region to defend against a renewed Russian offensive, many of the scouts had just been reassigned from rear roles and were given just two weeks preparation before being sent into combat, to carry out tasks that at times require sneaking behind enemy lines.\n\n>What is taught in Ukrainian training centers \u201cis complete nonsense,\u201d said a 32-year-old soldier in the unit with the call sign Chirva. \u201cEverything is learned on the spot.\u201d\n\n>An officer who has spent more than a year instructing new soldiers at one of Ukraine\u2019s facilities said the training centers are low on Soviet-caliber ammunition because it is being saved for troops on the battlefield. That means recruits get little experience firing live rounds. The officer said the training center received just 20 bullets per person.\n\n>\u201cThere are no grenades for throwing in training centers, and there are no grenade launcher rounds in the training center,\u201d said the officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. \u201cThis is the problem.\u201d\n\n>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a proper training system in place,\u201d the officer continued, adding that Ukraine needs its instructors to be taught by NATO trainers to condense the standard two-month basic training into one month.\n\n>A current priority for Ukraine\u2019s General Staff is securing more training for recruits abroad \u2014 at facilities that can\u2019t be targeted by Russian bombardment, unlike those in Ukraine. Britain so far has provided the most basic training for Ukrainians. In a potential boost, France is considering sending instructors to Ukraine to help prepare draftees, Syrsky said in a post on social media this week.\n\nAnother article on the deficit of training for Ukrainian troops. Most of the article goes over well worn topics including mobilization, poorer, physical health, higher age of recruits, men volunteering for specific brigades, and overall hesitation on enlistment due to poor training.\n\nHowever, the new thing I found from the article is that even the troops released from the rear are still poorly trained. I wouldn't expect them to be highly drilled since they aren't front line troops, but after a year/s in the service, they should have some basic level of competency from routine training. It seems that isn't the case, at least widespread.\n\nThe reason being (as pointed out in the article) there's a shortage of small rounds and experienced trainers. The latter could be helped by putting trainers in Ukraine, but the former is just about more aid. How accessible Russian calibers are for the West to buy and donate I don't know. A possible solution is to switch all their firearms to NATO caliber I've, but that is also a monumental task. One benefit for training outside Ukraine that is overlooked is that the training centers are well staffed and supplied, and the Ukrainians go home with the equipment they trained with. \n\nAs an aside, this topic seems spring anew every in the summer.\n\n[(June 2022) Modern War Institute at West Point: Time is not of Kyiv's side: Training, Weapons and Attrition in Ukraine ](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/time-is-not-on-kyivs-side-training-weapons-and-attrition-in-ukraine)\n\n[(June 2023) War on the Rocks: What the Ukrainian Armed Forces need to do to win](https://warontherocks.com/2023/06/what-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-need-to-do-to-win/)\n\n[(June 2023) NATO: Training Ukraine\u2019s volunteer army](https://www.natomultimedia.tv/app/asset/691064)\n\n[(July 2023) Jack Watling in the Guardian: West must focus on preparing Ukraine\u2019s troops \u2013 or we will all pay the price](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/23/west-must-focus-on-preparing-ukraines-troops-or-we-will-all-pay-the-price)\n\n[(July 2023) War on the Rocks: Ukraine doesn't need US contractors](https://warontherocks.com/2023/07/ukraine-doesnt-need-u-s-contractors/)\n\n[(July 2023) Ukraine\u2019s Lack of Weaponry and Training Risks Stalemate in Fight With Russia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraines-lack-of-weaponry-and-training-risks-stalemate-in-fight-with-russia-f51ecf9)",

                "body": "> Most spent fuel rods at US reactors are in dry cask storage\n\n1. In the scenario above, none of the fuel rods are spent. Not that it's a bad thing, new fuel rods are less radioactive because they're made of 99.9% uranium and plutonium, instead of the cascade of radioactive byproducts.\n\n2. Those giant concrete containers need to be giant to absorb the massive amounts of radiation coming off large quantities of spent fuel. \n\n> Just thinking about the total mass of the fuel rods I don't see how you get contamination across the entire state. That just doesn't pass the sniff test in my lay opinion. I'd want to see some back of the envelope estimates at least to justify such extreme claims.\n\nFrom the info I could gather quickly, a \"spent\" (ie. more radioactive) fuel rod bundle will emit 50-60 sieverts per hour at a distance of 30cm. If we're looking at radiation doses to quickly kill someone ([4-5 sieverts will kill 50% of the population in a 30 days period](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/lethal-dose-ld.html)), then no: it's orders of magnitude insufficient.\n\nBut you don't need to have such intense radiation levels to guarantee that no one with >2 brain cells will decide to not live in cancer country. The Fukushima emergency workers were allowed to be exposed to 250 millisieverts per year, so I think it's very conservative to set the bar at that dosage. \n\nThat bundle will emit >438k sieverts per year (again, at 30cm distance), which means having ~0.01g (each bundle is 20kg) of spent fuel in your immediate vicinity is no bueno. You probably need to divide that by 100 or more if it's on your clothes or in your lungs. There are probably more than 5000 bundles in a large reactor and there are 2 such reactors at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, so it totals much above 10k bundles. If each 0.01g of spent fuel can contaminate 1m^2 and we assume perfect distribution of the nuclear fallout, we're looking at something like 20 km^2 .\n\nBut again, that's for an unreasonable level of radiation. Nature will be fine in California, but people won't accept a \"90% chance of cancer in 20 years\" just because they might get lucky and avoided the fallout where they live. More importantly: wind carrying dust and contaminated waterways (rain will wash away a lot of those radioactive nucleus) pretty much guarantees that everyone gets exposed.

Contrast this with Israel who needs to defend a far smaller area and doesn\u2019t need to defend it to any significant depth.
