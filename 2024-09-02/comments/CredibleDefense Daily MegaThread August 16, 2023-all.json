One deputy battalion commander spoke of at least six mechanics from his unit who had been killed in recent months.\n\nMr. Ivanov was head of the technical department at Mitsubishi Motors Ukraine until he left his job and \u201cnice office\u201d in the capital, Kyiv, to join the territorial defense force when Russia invaded 16 months ago.\n\nHe served as a platoon commander for months until the army\u2019s logistics command plucked him out of the trenches to help maintain the growing number of NATO vehicles supplied to Ukraine, many of them equipped with sophisticated electronics and diagnostics.\n\n\u201cWe were ready for damaged equipment \u2014 it\u2019s war,\u201d said Ihor, 57, deputy commander of weapons and maintenance, who uses the call sign Blago and gave only his first name for security reasons.\n\nSome of the vehicles were beyond repair, their wheels and engines mangled from mine explosions and their bodies ripped open by rocket and artillery fire. But Ihor said that his teams had managed to repair over 40 NATO armored vehicles and eight tanks in the camp in the past month, often taking parts from destroyed ones.\n\n\u201cWe try to reuse everything,\u201d he said. He came to an American-made Oshkosh armored vehicle that had been burned out. \u201cWe can\u2019t fix it,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut it will become a donor \u2014 its parts will allow us to repair another seven vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian forces have by necessity made use of captured Russian armor and weaponry. In one yard, the head of weapons and maintenance for the 35th Marine Brigade, who uses the call sign Hammer, said that the brigade had captured more than 20 Russian vehicles in the past six weeks of fighting.\n\nAmong the \u201ctrophies\u201d were eight Russian multipurpose fighting vehicles, which the brigade had never had before, and a T-72 tank. \u201cWithout the Russian captured vehicles, we would not manage to keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nYet Ukrainian troops have started to appreciate the protection afforded by the strong armor of the various NATO vehicles, which saves more lives than the old Soviet equipment, Hammer and other mechanics said. Even when soldiers and marines took heavy casualties in recent battles in the counteroffensive, a lot of them survived inside the NATO vehicles, marines said.\n\nCritically, the swift repairs were keeping the NATO vehicles in use, Hammer said.\n\n\u201cThe Russians can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cA few days and the vehicle is back on the battlefield.

Excerpts posted below:\n\nFrom the beginning of May to the present, 3 OShBr \\[3rd Separate Assault Brigade\\] mounted six deliberate operations southwest of Bakhmut. They all succeeded. These were day, infantry-led assaults, in company and platoon strength against strong points and trench lines. Tanks were used in ones and twos to lead in assaults and to provoke flight. Objectives were \u2018prepped\u2019 with artillery and rocket fire. Over the twelve weeks, 3 OShBr inflicted a three-figure number of casualties on Russian forces while only suffering light casualties. Around 20 prisoners were taken (with video evidence), but the true number will be higher. Russian equipment and ammunition storage sites were destroyed. Four units were defeated and a Russian major general was sacked and then apparently re-instated.\n\nNotwithstanding this success, there is the unavoidable question of tempo. The explanations for 3OShBr\u2019s slow advance do not lie in mine belts and defensive obstacles which are slowing down the Ukrainian counter-offensive on the Zaphorizhzhia front. Russian forces never built these in this sector, as they were advancing with the intent to capture Bakhmut and the surrounding area. The three principal reasons for the slow tempo are:\n\n* **Casualty aversion**: 3 OShBr has been pursuing a deliberate policy of re-capturing ground, incurring no or few casualties. This goal has been achieved but has reduced the tempo of Ukrainian operations.\n* **Soldier weights**: In an infantry war, an assault can only advance as far as a soldier of average fitness can fight before exhaustion sets in.\n* **Artillery**: Artillery (and rocket) fire is still accounting for four in five casualties. This may explain why of 100 Ukrainian soldiers wounded within 3 miles of the front line, 36% are very seriously wounded (shrapnel wounds). After capturing a Russian strongpoint or trench line, Ukrainian troops perforce must remain in place as the standard Russian response is to bombard the lost positions. In one recent case, Ukrainian soldiers had to share the trenches with the Russian dead which could not be moved (not least because the departing Russians, who not uncommonly abandon their dead, had booby-trapped the corpses). The only option was to cover the corpses with plastic sheets which due to the cramped conditions were used as \u2018soft\u2019 seats, while smoking heavily to disguise the smells. A Ukrainian soldier asked whether he was not afraid one of bodies might suddenly detonate, replied; \u2018Everything is detonating here.'\n\nThis methodical approach has worked for 3 OShBr, but it carries an important penalty: breakthrough is not achieved. The defender is afforded 2-3 week windows to reinforce, re-build defences, and prepare for the next Ukrainian push. This has been the pattern for the last three months. Emphatically, this war is not the coming of the tank Antichrist \u2013 the tank a platform with \u2018no future\u2019 \u2013 as some commentary suggests. On the contrary: every day is a reminder that until someone rediscovers brigade-level, mobile, all arms, armoured warfare, the grinding penny-packet infantry attrition will continue.\n\nNote: All links provided by the article have been scrubbed because I've gotten into hot water three times already with the links, you'd find the links in the regular article.",

But, judging by everything, the enemy did not stop there.

The fact is that to the east of this village are the forward positions of the enemy's main line of defense, and to the west is a local line of support points (to the village of Kopani), which in idea, should cover the Novoprokopiv defense node of the enemy from the west and northwest... behind which, in turn, the forward positions of the enemy's main line of defense also begin. Therefore, it is obvious that bypassing by the advancing units of the Armed Forces of the village of Robotyne on both flanks, in fact, not only leaves no sense for the enemy to hold it, but also quite likely can lead to the Armed Forces making way to the main line of the enemy's defense on a fairly wide front. starting with Novoprokopivka and ending with Verbove.  \nConsidering the fact that the advancing units of the Armed Forces east of the village have already advanced to the enemy's main line of defense and continue to expand this wedge, the issue of advancing the Armed Forces along the road T-04-08 from Novodanilivka to Novoprokopivka (that is, from the other, western side of the village of Robotyne) becomes of special importance...  \nThe enemy equipped this local line of strongpoints along several long forest strips that stretch from the western outskirts of the village of Robotyne all the way to Kopany itself...  \nThe units of the enemy's 291st motorized rifle regiment (msp) are defending here. During the past 3 days, the advanced units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to dislodge its units from these fortified positions on certain sections of the defense area of this regiment... In fact, thus creating conditions for bypassing the village of Robotyne not only from the east, but also from the west...  \nMoreover, as far as I understand, the enemy took these actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (regarding the bypass of Robotina from the west) quite seriously... That is why the battalion of the 810th Infantry Regiment, transferred here from the Myrne region, appeared in the rear of the enemy's 291st Infantry Division. And judging by everything, in this sense he will clearly not be the last...  \nSo far, the main efforts of the enemy are concentrated precisely in the direction of Robotyne - Novoprokopivka (there are units of at least 2 \"motorized rifle\" regiments of territorial troops\\\\msp TrV - 1430th and more \"fresh\" 1441th)... but, it is obvious that the issue of both flanks of this main offensive direction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine acquires special importance for the enemy...",

And judging by everything, in this sense he will clearly not be the last...<br/>\nSo far, the main efforts of the enemy are concentrated precisely in the direction of Robotyne - Novoprokopivka (there are units of at least 2 &quot;motorized rifle&quot; regiments of territorial troops\\msp TrV - 1430th and more &quot;fresh&quot; 1441th)... but, it is obvious that the issue of both flanks of this main offensive direction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine acquires special importance for the enemy...</p>\n</div>",

And in this way, the entire 7th dshd will gather here...  \nThus, we can state several things about the operational situation in the Southern Operational Zone:  \n\\- The Ukrainian command is deliberately \"increasing the tension of the enemy's reserve ropes\"... Active offensive actions only in 2 (TWO) directions - Tokmak and Berdyansk, are already causing the enemy certain troubles with reserve formations. But in this sense, obviously, the Armed Forces can potentially \"add\" 2 more, and then, if necessary, 1 more direction...  \n\\- Yes, this is also influencing Armed Forces (because they also have to use additional troops/forces for this). But the scale is not even comparable to the Russian one... because in this matter, not only the quantitative dimension (the amount of forces and means involved), but also the qualitative one (that is, the level of combat capability) is important. Because of this, where the Armed Forces manage with one formation of the regiment/brigade level, the enemy is forced to use 2, or even 3 \"equal\" formations...  \n\\- Moreover, it is obvious that there is a direct correlation between the terms of active actions of the Armed Forces in the southern operational-strategic direction and the quality (level of combat capability) of the enemy's formations. He is objectively forced to shorten the terms of \"restoration\", \"replenishment\" and \"preparation\" of his reserve formations, because his need for them is \"by no means\" decreasing... but only growing... Moreover, he needs them HERE and NOW, not once \"in 2-3 months\"... A vivid example - the enemy has already drawn into his \"active\" troop grouping on the territory of Ukraine units and units from the strategic reserves, the formation and deployment of which he has NOT yet FINISHED .  \nIn conclusion, let me remind you... all ropes have a limit of tension that they can withstand, even steel ropes. Of course, taking into account the size of the human resources of the Russian Federation and taking into account the probability of another mobilization \"in the swamps\"... we can assume that losing almost a battalion every day killed and wounded... the Russian army can afford it, for a long time.. .But in this sense, it is always worth remembering - in this case, the probability of a skewed balance between the quantity (volume) and quality (level of combat capability) of its formations increases sharply...",

The problem for Russia with the current situation is, if Ukraine doesn't crumble, and Russia needs further mobilization then they can probably kiss 6 to 9 months goodbye while that mobilization and training takes place.

It's based around a bunch of propaganda that uses partial truths to prey on your reasoning abilities. You're used to thinking of truth as objective and so aren't prepared to handle the fact that you can build a lie from a bunch of truths.\n\nThe idea that Russia invaded Ukraine because it was going to join NATO is based on the truths that Ukraine was moving away from Russia and moving towards the EU and had been welcomed to join NATO by the US. They are put together and separated from everything else, specifically so that you'll make the reasonable conclusion that Russia was threatened. But the truth of that period is much different.\n\nUkraine had been moving towards the EU, true, but it was economically and it's not an either/or situation. Ukraine was in a situation where it could be friendly with both parties, but Russia specifically did not want that. In addition, Russia did not offer any incentives for keeping Ukraine within its own sphere of influence but instead sought to pressure them to remain there, leading to the Euromaidan when Yanukovych, whose largely accepted to have been in the pocket of Russia, refused to sign a free-trade agreement with the EU. If Russia so wanted to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, it could have done so, and even just allowed it to economically friendly to both the EU and Russia. They didn't, because they didn't want to. This is important to note, as the idea of Russia just trying to defend itself has an implied point that they would use something other than force, if they thought it was possible. They very much could have, but they chose not to. This is the homeowner saying 'what was I supposed to do? Just let them rob me?' when they shoot someone in the face for ringing their doorbell.\n\nUkraine had also been a part of the Membership Action Plan for NATO. That is true. But what that means is obfuscated. It is effectively a formalized way for member nations to review a country's application. There's nothing that inherently says that countries that join that will join NATO. In fact, it ignores what you should already know is the stipulation for joining NATO: All member countries need to agree to the country joining and each member country can set conditions for that country joining. When Ukraine was recommended by the US as a potential NATO member, there were multiple opposing nations. These are some of the same nations that have featured heavily in relations with Russia recently. Nations like Germany, who did so much at the advent of the war to allow Russia a way out, and Turkey, who are very favorable to Russia and made Finnish and Swedish integration difficult. Ukraine would have been kept in MAP for however long they would have needed to. Hell, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been in MAP since 2010 and their story is very similar of the US pushing for their inclusion and other states (in this case Serbia) being very against it. Their entry into map also happened in 2008 and was not the biggest concern of Russia. In fact, NATO membership had slightly better than 50% acceptance in the country and was heavily opposed by a large portion of the government. Following the election of Yanukovych in 2010 it was then entirely scrapped. It's not even after Euromaidan that entry into NATO is again pursued by Ukraine. Poroshenko's government specifically said there were no plans for that. It's not until *Russia invaded Ukraine* that Poroshenko started pursuing NATO membership. To add to that, we have multiple sources saying that Putin was offered that Ukraine would not join NATO in secret negotiations as a means to keep the peace but did not care. There you see that Ukraine joining NATO was not some assured thing as set out by Russian propaganda, and that it was not some new development that Russia had to avoid. You also see that nothing pushed Ukraine more towards joining NATO than Russia itself.\n\n\nI hope that helps you man. It's frustrating when people have been simply shown half the equation so they'll come to the wrong answer.",

In addition, Russia did not offer any incentives for keeping Ukraine within its own sphere of influence but instead sought to pressure them to remain there, leading to the Euromaidan when Yanukovych, whose largely accepted to have been in the pocket of Russia, refused to sign a free-trade agreement with the EU. If Russia so wanted to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, it could have done so, and even just allowed it to economically friendly to both the EU and Russia. They didn&#39;t, because they didn&#39;t want to. This is important to note, as the idea of Russia just trying to defend itself has an implied point that they would use something other than force, if they thought it was possible. They very much could have, but they chose not to. This is the homeowner saying &#39;what was I supposed to do? Just let them rob me?&#39; when they shoot someone in the face for ringing their doorbell.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine had also been a part of the Membership Action Plan for NATO. That is true. But what that means is obfuscated. It is effectively a formalized way for member nations to review a country&#39;s application. There&#39;s nothing that inherently says that countries that join that will join NATO. In fact, it ignores what you should already know is the stipulation for joining NATO: All member countries need to agree to the country joining and each member country can set conditions for that country joining. When Ukraine was recommended by the US as a potential NATO member, there were multiple opposing nations. These are some of the same nations that have featured heavily in relations with Russia recently. Nations like Germany, who did so much at the advent of the war to allow Russia a way out, and Turkey, who are very favorable to Russia and made Finnish and Swedish integration difficult. Ukraine would have been kept in MAP for however long they would have needed to. Hell, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been in MAP since 2010 and their story is very similar of the US pushing for their inclusion and other states (in this case Serbia) being very against it. Their entry into map also happened in 2008 and was not the biggest concern of Russia. In fact, NATO membership had slightly better than 50% acceptance in the country and was heavily opposed by a large portion of the government. Following the election of Yanukovych in 2010 it was then entirely scrapped. It&#39;s not even after Euromaidan that entry into NATO is again pursued by Ukraine. Poroshenko&#39;s government specifically said there were no plans for that. It&#39;s not until <em>Russia invaded Ukraine</em> that Poroshenko started pursuing NATO membership. To add to that, we have multiple sources saying that Putin was offered that Ukraine would not join NATO in secret negotiations as a means to keep the peace but did not care. There you see that Ukraine joining NATO was not some assured thing as set out by Russian propaganda, and that it was not some new development that Russia had to avoid. You also see that nothing pushed Ukraine more towards joining NATO than Russia itself.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that helps you man. It&#39;s frustrating when people have been simply shown half the equation so they&#39;ll come to the wrong answer.</p>\n</div>",

Mobilization isn't really something other countries are exactly up in arms over - if Russia wanted to show restraint, they'd get a lot more international good will by simply not attacking civilian targets with missiles, which is of very little military value compared to mobilization.\n\nRestraint would have been not invading in the first place. Whether they mobilize to further that invasion or not has very little impact on international opinion, outside of the West upping aid to attempt to compensate.\n\nThe idea they could win the war easily and are just choosing not to is pretty ridiculous (excluding the use of nuclear force). They already attempted to take Kyiv, and have stood by maximalist war aims for the entirety of the conflict. The international reputational damage is already done. Undermanning their war effort doesn't do anything for them internationally, but it does cost them a lot of lives, money, and equipment. It makes zero sense.\n\nIf *anything*, at this point, failing is doing more to damage their ability to project power in their sphere of influence.

The Ukrainians employed exactly the same, if not a bit worse, zergrush tactics in Kherson(initially, pre-attrition strat and Kharkiv) as they started out with this campaign. They&#39;ve changed it up now by necessity, but the current approach is slow by design. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re simply never going to overrun positions and conduct swift advances where you can actually take advantage of the defending troops&#39; lack of training before the defender can respond by sending in reinforcements.</p>\n</div>",

France also conducted joint operations with its former colony, but since the coup Paris and Washington have suspended military operations, giving the jihadis more breathing room.\n\n>A military detachment was attacked Tuesday afternoon as it moved between the villages of Boni and Torodi in the Tillaberi region, the Ministry of Defense said on state television Tuesday. The wounded were evacuated to the capital, Niamey.\n\n>It was the first major attack against Niger\u2019s army in six months, a worrying sign of possible escalation, said Wassim Nasr, a journalist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, a think tank.\n\n>\u201cWhat we are witnessing today is both jihadi warring factions, the Islamic State group and (al-Qaida affiliate Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin), marking their territory because of the security void caused by the coup. This definitely should be seen in the context of the ongoing war between the two groups,\u201d he said.\n\n>Neighboring countries are threatening military action against the coup, whose supporters said Wednesday that they would register volunteers to fight and help with other needs so the junta has a list in case it needs to call on people.\n\n>One organizer, Amsarou Bako, claimed that the junta is not involved in finding volunteers to defend the coup, although it is aware of the initiative.\n\n>It\u2019s not clear how real the possibility of regional conflict is.\n\n>Many Bazoum supporters have been silenced or gone into hiding, and rallies to support the president are quickly shut down by police. Several ministers and politicians from deposed President Mohamed Bazoum \u2019s regime have been detained since the coup, with human-rights groups unable to access to access them.\n\n>The West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, says it has activated a \u201cstandby force\u201d to restore order in Niger.\n\n>Bako, one of the founders, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that a recruitment drive will launch Saturday in Niamey as well as in cities where invasion forces might enter, such as near the borders with Nigeria and Benin, two countries that have said they would participate in an intervention.\n\n>Regional tensions are deepening as the standoff between Niger and ECOWAS shows no signs of defusing, despite signals from both sides that they are open to resolving the crisis peacefully. Last week the junta said it was open to dialogue with ECOWAS after rebuffing the bloc\u2019s multiple efforts at talks, but shortly afterwards charged Bazoum with \u201chigh treason\u201d and recalled its ambassador from neighboring Ivory Coast.\n\n>Analysts say the longer the coup drags on, the less likely an intervention will occur as the junta cements its grip on power, likely forcing the international community to accept the status quo.\n\n>United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday there was still room for diplomacy to return the country to constitutional rule and said the U.S. supported ECOWAS\u2019 dialogue efforts, including its contingency plans.\n\n>The new U.S. ambassador to Niger, Kathleen FitzGibbon, is expected to arrive in Niamey at the end of the week, according to a U.S. official. The United States hasn\u2019t had an ambassador in the country for nearly two years. Some Sahel experts say this has left Washington with less access to key players and information.\n\n>While regional and western countries scramble for how to respond, many Nigeriens are convinced they\u2019ll soon be invaded. The country of some 25 million people is one of the poorest in the world and residents are hoping the new regime will set the nation on a new path. In Niamey Wednesday, eager locals said they\u2019d do what it took to defend the country.\n\n>\u201cMy children and I love these soldiers and I invite young people to join the army and develop our country and our villages,\u201d said Amadou Hawa, a Niamey resident who lives in a shanty town on the side of the road.\n\n>The details of Niger\u2019s volunteer force are still vague, but similar initiatives in neighboring countries have yielded mixed results. Volunteer fighters in Burkina Faso, recruited to help the army battle its jihadi insurgency, have been accused by rights groups and locals of committing atrocities against civilians.\n\n>Bako, one of the heads of the group organizing Nigerien volunteers, said Niger\u2019s situation is different.\n\n>\u201cThe (volunteers in Burkina Faso) are fighting the Burkinabe who took weapons against their own brothers ...

For Iran, this would mean agreeing not to enrich uranium above 60 per cent purity, improving its co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and pledging not to target Americans, said the Iranian official and another person briefed on the talks.\n\n>**In return, Washington would refrain from imposing fresh sanctions in some areas, with the exception of those involving human rights, and would not strictly police the sanctions already in place on oil sales**, the Iranian official said.\n\n>The Islamic republic wants the US to convince European allies to also ease pressure on Iran, as its economy is being strangled by US sanctions imposed after former president Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear accord.\n\n>**A concern in Tehran is that the UK, Germany and France, the European signatories to the 2015 deal, could seek to reimpose some sanctions once clauses from the nuclear accord that restricted Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme expire in October**, the Iranian official said.\n\n>**\u201cWe\u2019re very much concerned about October,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe expect [the US] to ease pressure on Iran from different sides.\u201d**\n\n>The US and Iran have reached agreements on most issues, but the discussions \u2014 which are held through intermediaries \u2014 would continue in Qatar and Oman, particularly on Russia, the official added.\n\n>The person briefed on the talks said the prisoner exchange was not contingent on the de-escalatory measures, but added that such a move could help build trust between the parties. A western official said the prisoner deal was a pre-requisite for any progress on the de-escalatory nuclear steps.\n\n>But the diplomat also cautioned that **\u201cthere\u2019s quite a big gap between having that conversation [on de-escalatory measures] with an Iranian and then the whole Iranian system being willing to implement it\u201d.**\n\n>Under the exchange, Iran would release the four US prisoners transferred from Evin prison last week, plus one other American already under house arrest. The US would release five Iranians.\n\n>Washington would also allow Tehran to access $6bn in frozen oil funds held in South Korea, once the money has been transferred to an account in Qatar, where it will be monitored to ensure that it is only used for non-sanctioned goods.\n\n>It is expected to be several weeks before the US nationals fly out of Tehran, as the transfer of the $6bn is sequenced with the prisoner releases.\n\n>US officials will only be confident the deal has held once the prisoners held in Iran have cleared Iranian airspace, analysts said.\n\n>Given how far Iran\u2019s nuclear programme has advanced, the consensus among officials and analysts is that the 2015 accord is beyond repair.\n\n>As a result, the Biden administration wants to contain the nuclear crisis until after the 2024 US presidential elections.

For Iran, this would mean agreeing not to enrich uranium above 60 per cent purity, improving its co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and pledging not to target Americans, said the Iranian official and another person briefed on the talks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In return, Washington would refrain from imposing fresh sanctions in some areas, with the exception of those involving human rights, and would not strictly police the sanctions already in place on oil sales</strong>, the Iranian official said.</p>\n\n<p>The Islamic republic wants the US to convince European allies to also ease pressure on Iran, as its economy is being strangled by US sanctions imposed after former president Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear accord.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A concern in Tehran is that the UK, Germany and France, the European signatories to the 2015 deal, could seek to reimpose some sanctions once clauses from the nuclear accord that restricted Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme expire in October</strong>, the Iranian official said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cWe\u2019re very much concerned about October,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe expect [the US] to ease pressure on Iran from different sides.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>The US and Iran have reached agreements on most issues, but the discussions \u2014 which are held through intermediaries \u2014 would continue in Qatar and Oman, particularly on Russia, the official added.</p>\n\n<p>The person briefed on the talks said the prisoner exchange was not contingent on the de-escalatory measures, but added that such a move could help build trust between the parties. A western official said the prisoner deal was a pre-requisite for any progress on the de-escalatory nuclear steps.</p>\n\n<p>But the diplomat also cautioned that <strong>\u201cthere\u2019s quite a big gap between having that conversation [on de-escalatory measures] with an Iranian and then the whole Iranian system being willing to implement it\u201d.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Under the exchange, Iran would release the four US prisoners transferred from Evin prison last week, plus one other American already under house arrest. The US would release five Iranians.</p>\n\n<p>Washington would also allow Tehran to access $6bn in frozen oil funds held in South Korea, once the money has been transferred to an account in Qatar, where it will be monitored to ensure that it is only used for non-sanctioned goods.</p>\n\n<p>It is expected to be several weeks before the US nationals fly out of Tehran, as the transfer of the $6bn is sequenced with the prisoner releases.</p>\n\n<p>US officials will only be confident the deal has held once the prisoners held in Iran have cleared Iranian airspace, analysts said.</p>\n\n<p>Given how far Iran\u2019s nuclear programme has advanced, the consensus among officials and analysts is that the 2015 accord is beyond repair.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the Biden administration wants to contain the nuclear crisis until after the 2024 US presidential elections. If Biden wins, there could be an opening to secure a more comprehensive agreement, analysts said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe best-case scenario from the perspective of US policy is to keep things from getting worse and avoid a major escalation,\u201d said Henry Rome, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think-tank. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of risk . . . and a lot of reasons to be wary that things can hold for that long.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Previous diplomatic efforts to roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear programme have failed, and US officials have warned that the country\u2019s advances in enriching uranium mean it could take as little as two weeks for Tehran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon.</p>\n\n<p>Iran has been enriching uranium at 60 per cent \u2014 its highest-ever level and close to weapons grade \u2014 for two years after aggressively increasing its nuclear activity in response to Trump\u2019s measures.</p>\n\n<p>The Biden administration engaged in EU-mediated talks with Tehran shortly after taking office to see if the 2015 deal could be saved.

Here are three examples.\n\n>Iranian state actors have another weapon in their arsenal. Since June 2022, multiple Iranian state groups have deployed a new type of attack vector known as cyber-enabled influence operations (IO). This technique combines offensive computer network operations with messaging and amplification in a coordinated and manipulative fashion. The goal is to further geopolitical objectives by shifting the perceptions, behaviors, and decisions of their end targets. \n\n>Likely motivated by its inability to match the sophistication of past cyberattacks against the regime, Iran is leveraging cyber-enabled IO to boost, exaggerate, or compensate for shortcomings in its network access or cyberattack capabilities. \n\n>3 Examples Of Cyber-Enabled IO\n\n>Microsoft linked 24 unique cyber-enabled IO to the Iranian government last year, including 17 since June 2022. This is compared with just seven cyber-enabled IO in 2021, demonstrating Iran's increasing reliance on the technique. \n\n>Interestingly, the rise in these operations has also coincided with a decline in ransomware and wiper attacks by Iranian military affiliates \u2014 the most dominant being the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Instead, Iran is now leveraging low-impact, low-sophistication cyberattacks, such as defacements, to bolster its cyber-enabled IO. These attacks take less time and fewer resources, enabling Iran to dedicate more effort to multipronged amplification methods instead.\n\n>This trend can be seen in three key examples.\n\n>>1 Bolstering Palestinian Resistance\n\n>In February 2022, the group known as Storm-1084 used destructive cyberattacks in concert with messaging that encouraged pushback against Israel's policies toward Palestinians. Believed to have Iranian ties, the group masked its attack as ransomware and included a ransom note that called Israel \"an apartheid regime\" that should \"pay for occupation, war crimes against humanity, killing the people,\" including Palestinians.\n\n>>2 Inciting Shi'ite Unrest in Bahrain\n\n>Also in February 2022, a cyber persona known as Al-Toufan took credit for defacing multiple Bahraini and Israeli websites. This attack happened in conjunction with the 12th anniversary of nationwide anti-government protests in Bahrain. Al-Toufan used these attacks to fan protests among the politically underrepresented Shi'ite majority in Bahrain by calling attention to poverty and inflation in the region. \n\n>The group replaced legitimate content on news and government websites with articles that criticized the regime. Sockpuppet Arabic-language social media accounts were later used to amplify the defacements. A similar attack happened in November 2022 when Cotton Sandstorm launched its first cyber-enabled IO against Bahrain\u2019s parliamentary elections.\n\n>>3 Countering Normalization Of Arab-Israeli Ties\n\n>Finally, in December 2022, a cyber persona known as Atlas Group (believed to be Cotton Sandstorm) took credit for hijacking an Israeli sports website. The group posted a message stating that Israelis were not welcome at the World Cup in Qatar or in any Muslim countries. This message was then amplified by sockpuppet accounts in an attempt to intensify Arab-Israeli animosity. Notably, Atlas Group launched its influence operation during the World Cup quarterfinals \u2014 one month after Israel and Qatar agreed to establish direct flights for the games.\n\n>Iran is likely to continue honing its cyber and influence capabilities in an attempt to match the sophistication of its adversaries' cyberattacks and retaliate against perceived threats to the regime. Additionally, new influence techniques will allow Iran to add to the amplification, realism, and ultimate effectiveness of its campaigns.\n\n>For the broader cybersecurity community, this underscores the importance of reliable, comprehensive threat intelligence. NATO member nations and European nations may be at heightened risk. Currently, Israel is the most targeted country, making up 23% of Iranian attacks. They are followed closely by the US (13%) and the United Arab Emirates (8%). By continuing to monitor Iranian attack trends, these and other target groups can better fortify their own protections.",

I'm imagining something around 20 kg that can lob a few grenades a short distance and then return.  It doesn't need armor because it's fairly expendable with no crew.  Sure, you would need some decent sized tires, but I think we can skip the German suspension.  Millions of dollars is a ludicrous estimate.",

E.G. in the 2007 <em>Crysis</em> game that everyone memes, the human enemies were originally Chinese; why would North Koreans be on an island called &quot;Lingshan&quot; in the <strong>South China Sea</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>For other countries, the relationship is much more complicated. Pretty much all countries still fetishizes Chinese culture <em>hard</em>. The most blatantly obvious would be Japan and Korea, both of whom have conservatives that adamantly insist on learning written Chinese and learning Confucian philosophy. Even Taiwan, Pan Green is campaigning to reject Mandarin and replacing it with Hokkien, which is from <em>Fujian</em>. Southeast Asia is much more complicated, have deeply rooted racism against Chinese people dating back over a century. But the same could be said towards Europe just a few decades ago so who knows how that&#39;ll go.</p>\n</div>",

For example you can see it in the Annals history record of Dai Viet, one of most complete history records made by Vietnam dynasties, with the commentators of officials ordered by the emperor to edit and add new contents to it, so you can see the views of the intellectual class about history events and geopolitical stance of Vietnam. \n\n\nIn the pre-modern and modern era though, there were two biggest immigration waves: during the fall of the Ming and the late Qing (late 19th century-early 20th century), it's a chaotic era when  you probably won't want to be in China. Between two big waves there are many smaller steady waves of Chinese immigrants as merchants who trade and then settled in Vietnam, slowly build the community in the country. Vietnam authorities, for example Nguyen dynasty also employs many policies to integrate them into the local and limits their power, as they dominate the trade sector or mining, some of them support the rebels against the central authority like the Le Van Khoi rebellion. These Chinese mainly are southern Chinese from Fujian and Guangdong. They have really big influence in culture, religion, customs of Vietnam, you can see it in pretty much every history book written about the early 20th century period. \n\n\nFor the geopolitics side though. Under the French colonization the average farmers only care about how to fill their belly and don't have to sell their children for money ( it's not novel fantasy things but happened, just to show you how brutal that era is). But the nationalists intellectuals class of the two countries, there's a mutual sympathy as \"the fellows race get oppressed by the colonial powers\". For example: Phan Boi Chau, a nationalist, want to learn from Japanese and want support from Japan to kick the French out, has some of his books translated to Chinese. Or Ho Chi Minh is a reader of Lu Xun, a nationalist author of China in early 20th century. If you look at Ho Chi Minh activities before he established Vietminh, he had a long time in China and befriended with many Chinese figures that later on become important politicians in the CCP and get support from PRC to help Vietnam against French and Americans\n\n\nThough I think people misunderstood, this era HCM and his peers are first and foremost is the nationalist before communist. The Vietminh, as Vietnam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi, aka the alliance for independence of Vietnam. It is an alliance between various groups of nationalists that lead by the VCP and formed in 1941 when HCM returned to Vietnam. But later on the elements of the Vietminh gradually turn into Vietnam communist party. So their goal still firstly to kick the imperialists power out of Vietnam. After the French is out, the north established North Vietnam lead by VCP, get a lot of support from PRC while in the South, the Chinese community still hold a large economical power as many trading and industry dominated by them, especially in the Cho Lon market in Saigon. Though the relationship is cracked when sino-Soviet split and Vietnam choose USSR instead of China. And after 1975, VCP implying various crackdown to seize Chinese community property and drive them to collective farms, so many Chinese-Vietnamese fled. But the ultimate is the 1979 sino-Vietnamese goal as VCP expelled the Chinese community out of Vietnam, that's why you see many of the \"boat people\" that run away from Indochina in 80s, many of them are Chinese origin. I think the sino-Vietnamese war in 1979 having affects to the public opinion of Vietnamese about China, the same way public opinion of Ukrainian public opinion about Russia in foreseeable future ( but in lesser extent of course, i d say it gonna take a long time for the mental wound between Ukrainian and Russian heal after this war end). \n\n\n\nThe VCP considered PRC as the enemy in the 1979. Although the war would continue until the 90s but the economic situation of Vietnam was very dry, so the Vietnamese PM Nguyen Van Ninh enacted the Doi Moi policy to change the economic system and open the market, similar to the one Deng xiao ping did in 1978. Through the 90s-2000s-2010s, the Vietnam-China relationship has some awkwardness: in one hand the political elite still wary of Chinese ambitions, especially the public still very hate China due to the war and some rumors about the evil Chinese poisoning Vietnamese and the education of Vietnam to rile up nationalism, and the neighbor up north is a good scapegoat for the image of small but brave Vietnam underdog. But in other hand Vietnam open the market, China is a important trading partner, especially in agriculture products. Chinese culture influence, even though not as big as Japanese or Korean or the west, but still a lot. This only increase as  China power is rising. But China also do some very bad diplomatic moves that turn Vietnam away like the HD 981 drills into Vietnam economic zones that sparked a big riot or the island disputes, aggressive Chinese patrols boat etc..if China did it better, I'd say they can make Vietnam slightly leaning towards China side\n\n\nAbout wether Vietnam would side with China or US, I'd say it's hard to tell but it's more like neither. Vietnam would take the neutral side, treading on thin ice to balance between US and China. But things may change in future with how things play out and climate change. That's being said, I think your last point is kinda inaccurate. US is playing hard to persuade Vietnam to join its side, like Blinken visit, backed by representatives of 50 US big companies to discuss and invest into Vietnam. US also sending its underlings, like Australia ( PM visit), South Korea ( President visits) and Japan ( PM visit), especially SK and Japan, who has big investment in Vietnam and has much more positive views in the eyes of normal Vietnamese compared to China",

Because it can mean multiple things. \n\nDoes it mean that strategically Ukraine no longer cares about liberating territory and only hope to wear out the Russian army to cause them to quit the war? That's just not true, they obviously still care about liberating territory because every time they move a bit deeper in the latest village they're fighting for they're super quick to announce their new gains. \n\nWhile it's clear the Ukrainians are using a strategy of attrition, it's more accurately described as an strategy of exhaustion, to break the Russian govt and sociatal willpower and resolve for continuing the war. But just killing troops and destroying vehicles or equipment isn't going to do that alone, it needs leads legit victories to cement home that no matter what they plan they'll fail. But the Russian plan to defend the South isn't failing, that's the problem. Is it costly? Absolutely, but Ukraine is looking bad for their lack of progress.\n\nAlso, when it comes to straight military attrition strategies,believing that Russia, a country that historically dominates attrition warfare who are a glutton for punishment will quit Ukraine, well at best that's a superbly risky strategy to pursue. Considering their reserves, and the incredibly ruthless choices they've made to remain in this fight, it's a bad bet to believe they'll quit because a few more hundred thousand troops were casualties. They can just do another partial mobilization to make those up. \n\nWhere military attrition is more feasible is at the tactical level to try to make advances possible. When assaults and other form of maneuver don't work, and the only way to even conduct successful attacks is squad and platoon level dismounted infantry attacks, which can't possibly cause big gains, then they need to rely on fires to do most of the work. Even if they wanted to breakthrough into the undefended enemy rear they can't do that by assault, it'll be too costly or impossible. So they've switched to attrition to weaken the Russians and force them to retreat due to losses and small scale tactical assaults.\n\nBut the problem with that approach is that it's incredibly slow and costly in terms of ammunition for that firepower. \n\nUkraine is on a very fixed budget in terms of monthly artillery ammo allocations and even with boosts from South Korea stockpile (330-500k in May) and DPICM (a few hundred thousand) that's not enough to dominate in fires for a lengthy period. Most especially, they can't fire all of it for the offensive because then they're literally out of ammo afterwards, and allied monthly output that they give to Ukraine isn't remotely enough, they barely make in a month what Ukraine shoots in 2-3 days. \n\nNot to mention GMLRS,, which the UAF are firing now at basically anything of value they can find, especially at the tactical level. There is nothing wrong with that, they should rely on deep fires PGM capabilities during a strategic offensive, but they don't have the stockpiles to do that for a long time, the US and other EU allies giving them GMLRS definitely can't support it. \n\nThe reason nobody goes on the offensive all the time isn't because they don't want to, it's mostly because they can't supply it. It's incredibly logistically intensive, they need months or longer to stockpile ammo, and once they run low, that's that.",

There's no mobilization hesistation because they're just not making a big announcement over it. This has been reiterated by experts like Kofman for awhile now. Obviously we don't have hard numbers on the scale of new conscription but I wouldn't be surprised if Russia's manpower situation is currently stable right now.\n\nAnd, even supposing it weren't, in 2-3 months the fall weather will basically shut down most of Ukraine's offensive activity.

Ukraine has now had the clear advantage in long-range precision fires for a long time. It has now also been able to obtain an artillery advantage in specific areas of the front thanks to good counter-battery fire, which is IMHO a very significant turn of events given that Russia relies on artillery for so much. With Western industrial output for artillery set to increase faster than Russia's, it's likely that Ukraine will be able to maintain and perhaps even expand this advantage.\n\nAlso, on a strategic level, pushing into the land bridge becomes easier with time as Russia's strategic depth becomes more and more squeezed between Ukraine's long-range fires and the coast of the Sea of Azov. We can also see that most of the fortifications Russia constructed over the course of a year are in the northern half of the land bridge, from the main line of defense to the line of contact. It should be safe to assume that Russia is currently building out defenses south of it's main defensive line, but the counter-offensive started only 2 and half months ago, so these new defenses are almost certainly less extensive.\n\nLastly, Russian ressources are not endless. The Soviet stocks were very large, but Russia does not have the industrial capacity to re-generate them as quickly as they are being destroyed. Fiscal space is becoming increasingly constrained for the Russian economy. In this context, an extended campaign of attrition is perhaps the safest choice for Ukraine.",

Several individuals connected to Russia contacted various Trump campaign associates, offering business opportunities to the Trump Organization and proffering damaging information on Clinton.

NATO has a clear membership process, even while abbreviated it would still require a full consensus of all members and a relatively long procedure. It might take years even if certain states will not be vetoing it, either out of collusion with Russia or due to intimidation by Russia. So essentially it would be a promise - nothing else - for a future maybe, while Ukraine has to submit and cede right now. Now, Russia wants Ukraine - all of it. Even if some negotiations will occur, they will only discuss the capitulation terms for Ukraine (without Ukraine's participation). Russia just needs to continue to attack and any NATO process would be frozen, effectively forever. Even the very idea of Ukraine in NATO is raising chances of escalation to war with Russia, something NATO is deathly afraid of. Combine it with the slowdown of the actual ascension process, and it is easy to see how the whole thing can be scrapped even if Ukraine is forced to surrender to Russian demands.\n\nAnd why Russia would accept anything like that? First of all, lets be clear: **Russia will never, under any circumstance, ever, negotiate with Ukraine in good faith**. It doesn't consider Ukraine to be an independent subject. The predator does not negotiate with its victims, only with other predators for terms on how to share the kill. That's how the russians see it anyway. \n\nBut beyond even that, Russia has made it clear that they will not accept anything that won't include full dismemberment of Ukraine, international recognition of annexed territories, complete demilitarization and disbanding of current Ukraine's governmental structures. That's a *minimalist* goal. A *maximalist* goal would require de-facto disbanding of NATO and disempowering of Europe, according to the ultimatum delivered to the US in November 2022. Both of these requirements are of course a tongue in cheek for *\"lie down, hands on back, don't resist while we eat you whole\"*.
