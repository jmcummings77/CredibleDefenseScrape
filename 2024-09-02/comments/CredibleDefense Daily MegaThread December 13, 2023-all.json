        "body": "[Facing A Navy-Wide Sailor Shortage, USS Ford Sheds 500-600 Crew](https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2023/12/12/facing-a-navy-wide-sailor-shortage-uss-ford-sheds-500-600-crew/?sh=1b1bde5b51c0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In the face of a massive shortage of Navy sailors, America\u2019s newest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), has downsized, cutting the crew aboard by hundreds of sailors.  \n>  \n>The cuts appear to be deep and dramatic. Over the past six months to a year, some 500 to 600 sailors have left the USS Ford and not been replaced. In fact, the USS Ford has shed so many crew members that the ship\u2019s company (core crew members that operate the vessel) is now below the Ford-class Carrier Program\u2019s original Acquisition Program Baseline objective of 2,391 billets\u2014a goal set back in 2004 that many observers considered unrealistic.  \n>  \n>In an emailed statement attributed to the commanding officer of the USS Ford, Captain Rick Burgess, the carrier is now \u201chome to approximately 4,070 sailors: 2,380 ship\u2019s company, 1,550 assigned to Carrier Wing EIGHT, and 140 embarked with Carrier Strike Group TWELVE and Destroyer Squadron TWO staffs.\u201d  \n>  \n>That represents an enormous reduction in the carrier\u2019s workforce.  \n>  \n>Just one year ago, the carrier\u2019s previous commander, Captain Paul Lanzilotta, led far larger crew of between 4,600 and 4,700 sailors through a short shakedown deployment, telling Naval News, \u201cthe crew assigned to the ship is 2,700 personnel. That\u2019s just the ship\u2019s company. The airwing adds about 1,700 people on top of that, and we would embark normally 200-300 additional folks for the strike group staff and destroyer squadron staff.\u201d  \n>  \n>At the time of publication, the Navy\u2019s \u201cFact File\u201d says the Ford-class\u2019s normal crew, air wing and staff compliment should be at around 4,539 sailors, within 90 percent of the 5,000 to 5,200 sailors aboard older Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. But now, after the apparent crew cuts, the USS Ford is apparently living up to the marketing rhetoric, and operating with a crew 20 percent smaller than a fully-staffed legacy Nimitz class carrier.  \n>  \n>The current complement appears to be unusually low. Even the aircraft carrier\u2019s December 2021 Selected Acquisition Report projected a \u201cship\u2019s force\u201d of 2716 billets, far higher than the 2,380 sailors currently aboard.  \n>  \n>To put things in perspective, the USS Ford has apparently shed almost enough sailors to staff two Flight IIA Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. And, according to a string of Navy statements over the past several months, the cuts didn\u2019t happen after a long run of analysis and tests. Most of the cuts appear to be organic, occurring while the USS Ford was on an active deployment, as the carrier operates on the fringes of a major conflict.  \n>  \n>Since Captain Burgess took command of the USS Ford at the end of April, leading the carrier off to it\u2019s first deployment in early May, a good segment of the aircraft carrier\u2019s crew appears to have vanished.  \n>  \n>While publicly released documents from the Navy and the USS Ford suggest the deployed crew on the USS Ford has shrunk, a Navy public affairs official would not confirm any firm figures, saying only that the ship deployed with \u201ca full compliment and has maintained it.\u201d  \n>  \n>But the Navy\u2019s own statements suggest steady attrition. As the USS Ford left Norfolk in May for the aircraft carrier\u2019s first official deployment, the aircraft carrier\u2019s very own magazine, The Wolverine, described the effort put into feeding a crew of \u201capproximately 4,500 sailors.\u201d  \n>  \n>Then, in August, The Wolverine reported the crew size was \u201cover 4,200 people.\u201d  \n>  \n>By September, The Wolverine said the crew size was 4,200.  \n>  \n>Then, in October, a Navy story, detailing the USS Ford\u2019s dedicated cadre of stationary bicycle \u201cSpin\u201d aficionados, reported the Ford\u2019s crew had reportedly dwindled to 4,179.  \n>  \n>And now, after barely two months\u2014and if the figures from the Ford\u2019s Skipper are accurate\u2014the USS Ford appears to have lost about another 100 sailors.  \n>  \n>What\u2019s Going On?  \n>  \n>Desertion, disease or even a mysterious, sailor-eating monster might be to blame for the USS Ford\u2019s vanishing workforce, but the most likely scenario, according to long-time Navy observers in Washington DC, is that, after the Navy\u2019s massive 20 percent miss in FY 2023 enlisted sailor recruitment goals, the Navy simply has no sailors to spare.  \n>  \n>An alternative scenario is that the ship has enjoyed an incredible uptick in efficiency, defying predictions based upon the USS Ford\u2019s last six and a half years of commissioned service.  \n>  \n>It could be a bit of both. The Navy desperately wants to position the Ford carrier program for success, and, given that the extended deployment will delay key, high-profile testing events, shedding crew offers an immediate boost to the platform\u2019s lifetime operational and maintenance savings, making the platform\u2019s ragged business case far more viable.  \n>  \n>Unfortunately, as this article went to press, the Navy had yet to respond to a query asking if the current staffing level was a temporary transient due to recruiting problems or if it was a more permanent change, reflecting an optimized crew.  \n>  \n>The future size of the Ford\u2019s crew may well be a moot point. Even if the massive cut to the USS Ford\u2019s crew is temporary, and the Navy gradually fixes recruitment problems and increases the Ford\u2019s compliment back to 4,600 to 4,700 sailors, this is a huge victory for the Ford-class carrier program.  \n>  \n>Nobody\u2014outside of a few stalwart carrier advocates\u2014thought the USS Ford could operate effectively with fewer than 2,391 sailors. Many Navy observers thought the carrier was understaffed. A few years ago, the Pentagon\u2019s testing arm even worried that \u201crecent estimates of expected combined manning of CVN 78, its air wing, embarked staffs, and detachments range from 4,656 to 4,758.\u201d As such, the Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) wondered if the crew would end up outstripping the ship\u2019s 4,666 berths.  \n>  \n>This is a big deal.  \n>  \n>Major and rapidly implemented crew cuts usually come with serious consequences, reducing vessel endurance, readiness and survivability. It doesn\u2019t seem to be the case right now. The USS Ford might be understaffed\u2014or, as a platform that is at the tail end of a deployment and still working out operational kinks, it may be serving as, essentially, a billet donor to other, more battle ready aircraft carriers.  \n>  \n>But, rather than break down, the carrier is breaking performance records. In fact, the ship recently spent ten weeks away from port, in what appears to be the vessel\u2019s longest uninterrupted period at sea since it was launched.  \n>  \n>The aircraft carrier is performing, too. According to Captain Burgess, \u201cSince October 9th, Carrier Air Wing EIGHT has flown more than 2,500 sorties without interruption from FORD while stationed in the Mediterranean Sea.\u201d  \n>  \n>While 2,500 sorties in nine weeks is still far less than the Navy\u2019s old-school sortie generation testing goal of around 4,800 sorties over the course of thirty days, it isn\u2019t half bad. And though USS Ford is still generating far fewer sorties than the 3383 strikes 4,104 Sailors aboard the World War II-era carrier USS Midway (CV-41) generated over the course of 42 nights of Desert Storm, USS Ford and its diminished crew are clearly holding their own.",

The latest incident takes the number of merchant ships attacked or approached around Yemen since Israel\u2019s war with Hamas broke out in October to about a dozen. Iran-backed Houthi militants, who support Hamas in the conflict, have claimed many of those hits.\n\n>The Ardmore Encounter came under attack while transiting the Red Sea, its owner and operator Ardmore Shipping Corp. said in a statement. No one boarded, all crew are safe and there was no damage on-board.\n\n>Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, said the international community needed to act fast against the Iran-backed rebel group, which has been fighting a civil war in Yemen since 2014 and has said it will target Israel and its assets unless the war in the Gaza Strip ends.\n\n>\u201cThe Houthis have crossed a red line in the Red Sea,\u201d Herzog said on X on Wednesday after the latest incident. \u201cUnder the direction of their totalitarian commanders in Tehran, the Houthis\u2019 continued acts of terrorism and piracy against ships of all nationalities and ownerships requires the entire international community to act, united, forcefully, and decisively.\u201d\n\n>The UK Maritime Trade Operations and security intelligence company Ambrey said shots were fired after a speedboat approached the Ardmore Encounter and that at least two missiles were launched.

            "body": "> **A counteroffensive delayed**\n> \n> Unlike previous national security leaks, the alleged disclosure of documents by Teixeira was unique in that it gave the public a glimpse of highly classified intelligence only weeks after the information was provided to senior military brass.  \n> \n> \n> The historic leaks by military analyst Daniel Ellsberg in 1971, U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 were stunning in their depth of insight into the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, and the long tentacles of the U.S. surveillance state. Each involved the disclosure of thousands of documents that exposed dense layers of government deceit and secrecy. But most of the classified files were years old by the time they were published.\n> \n> By contrast, the number of documents that were shared on the Discord server numbered in the hundreds, but they disclosed classified military assessments prepared for Milley that were only a month or two old and still operationally sensitive.\n> \n> U.S. officials sought to reassure Ukrainians that the advantage Russia might gain from the disclosures would be negligible. \u201cA lot of work was done with Ukraine to reassure them this wasn\u2019t going to affect the counteroffensive,\u201d a second U.S. official said.\n>   \n> \n> A former senior defense official noted that the United States in some cases had taken steps to mitigate vulnerabilities exposed in the leaks. In the case of the disclosure showing gaps in Ukraine\u2019s air defense network, that included working with allied nations to supply Ukraine with additional antimissile capability.    \n> \n> \u201cBy the time that information was out, we had already gone in 110 percent to try to address that problem,\u201d the former official said.\n> \n> Despite the reassurances, the leaks played at least a small role in delaying the start of the counteroffensive, which had already been held up as Kyiv waited for more Western weapons, according to Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration.  \n> \n> Ukrainian officials needed to \u201ctake some time to assess the situation\u201d because of the \u201cmassive leak of data,\u201d Stefanishyna said. \u201cYou cannot really take this risk [of starting the counterattack] until you have assessed everything and made your conclusions.\u201d\n> \n> The leak also raised doubts in Ukraine about Washington\u2019s ability to keep sensitive secrets \u2014 a concern noted by Zelensky\u2019s top advisers in September ahead of his trip to Washington to discuss war plans with Biden.\n> \n> \u201cDon\u2019t share anything with Biden you don\u2019t want on the front page of The Washington Post,\u201d an adviser warned Zelensky during a pre-trip meeting, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n> \n> The former senior defense official said that while the leaks represented a strain, they did not sever the intelligence-sharing relationship with Kyiv. He noted that Moscow already had extensive knowledge about Ukraine\u2019s military and government before the disclosures.\n> \n> But for the public, at least, there was much that was surprising.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>A counteroffensive delayed</strong></p>\n\n<p>Unlike previous national security leaks, the alleged disclosure of documents by Teixeira was unique in that it gave the public a glimpse of highly classified intelligence only weeks after the information was provided to senior military brass.  </p>\n\n<p>The historic leaks by military analyst Daniel Ellsberg in 1971, U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 were stunning in their depth of insight into the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, and the long tentacles of the U.S. surveillance state. Each involved the disclosure of thousands of documents that exposed dense layers of government deceit and secrecy. But most of the classified files were years old by the time they were published.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, the number of documents that were shared on the Discord server numbered in the hundreds, but they disclosed classified military assessments prepared for Milley that were only a month or two old and still operationally sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials sought to reassure Ukrainians that the advantage Russia might gain from the disclosures would be negligible. \u201cA lot of work was done with Ukraine to reassure them this wasn\u2019t going to affect the counteroffensive,\u201d a second U.S. official said.</p>\n\n<p>A former senior defense official noted that the United States in some cases had taken steps to mitigate vulnerabilities exposed in the leaks. In the case of the disclosure showing gaps in Ukraine\u2019s air defense network, that included working with allied nations to supply Ukraine with additional antimissile capability.    </p>\n\n<p>\u201cBy the time that information was out, we had already gone in 110 percent to try to address that problem,\u201d the former official said.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the reassurances, the leaks played at least a small role in delaying the start of the counteroffensive, which had already been held up as Kyiv waited for more Western weapons, according to Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration.  </p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials needed to \u201ctake some time to assess the situation\u201d because of the \u201cmassive leak of data,\u201d Stefanishyna said. \u201cYou cannot really take this risk [of starting the counterattack] until you have assessed everything and made your conclusions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The leak also raised doubts in Ukraine about Washington\u2019s ability to keep sensitive secrets \u2014 a concern noted by Zelensky\u2019s top advisers in September ahead of his trip to Washington to discuss war plans with Biden.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t share anything with Biden you don\u2019t want on the front page of The Washington Post,\u201d an adviser warned Zelensky during a pre-trip meeting, according to a person familiar with the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>The former senior defense official said that while the leaks represented a strain, they did not sever the intelligence-sharing relationship with Kyiv. He noted that Moscow already had extensive knowledge about Ukraine\u2019s military and government before the disclosures.</p>\n\n<p>But for the public, at least, there was much that was surprising. The leaks depicted Zelensky in a new light, revealing his apparent interest in occupying Russian border villages and obtaining long-range missiles to hit targets deep inside Russian territory \u2014 an assertion that Ukrainians deny and would have deeply angered Washington.  </p>\n\n<p>When confronted with the Discord leaks\u2019 gloomy predictions, many inside and outside the U.S. government either dismissed the intelligence assessments as wrong or insisted they were outdated.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhere Ukraine might have been a month ago, two months ago, three months ago, is not where it is now in terms of its ability, for example, to prosecute a counteroffensive and to deal with the ongoing Russian aggression,\u201d Blinken said in May, insisting Ukraine would make meaningful territorial gains and was achieving \u201ctangible progress.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Even in late August, amid mounting evidence that Russian defenses probably would stymie a Ukrainian breakthrough, influential military analysts in Washington insisted that major gains were still achievable.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUkraine\u2019s offensive push is far from over.

The lines went from [this on April 24](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/day_60_Kharkiv-Frontline-2048x1310.png), to [this on May 25](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/day_91_Kharkiv-Frontline-2048x1310.png). The Russians reinforced that sector quite a bit immediately around Kharkiv, leading to seesaw incremental changes in the lines mostly around Stary Saltiv, where the UAF were trying to establish a bridgehead across. Meanwhile, the front line sectors screening the advances to Kupyansk and Borova were largely bare of Russian and Ukrainian troops. \n\nIn late May, another small Ukrainian counteroffensive started against the Kherson Bridgehead, though it saw almost zero success. That one grinded away until roughly early July before being called off. \n\nThen Zelensky et al telegraphed the great Southern Counteroffensive, at which point the Russians reacted by sending most of their VDV and all of the Eastern Military District, who both had been used to attack the Donbas, in order to defend Kherson and Zap. oblasts. Which meant the weak points in Kharkiv Oblast were even weaker, with the Donbas sectors also became much weak too. \n\nWhen Zaluzhny canceled the Melitpol axis thrust sometime in July or August, he still desired another supporting counteroffensive elsewhere to draw Russian forces\\*. Though Syrsky took the credit for promoting Kharkiv as the target, some say it was the head of the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, but whomever it was that pitched the idea, Zaluzhny agreed they'd aim an offensive at the weak point west of Kupyansk-Borova. \n\nOnly weeks before the attack started, five UAF brigades who had all been fighting in the Kharkiv or Donbas front for months were pulled off the line, given a few weeks to integrate some batteries of M777 artillery with Excalibur ammo, and otherwise prep, at which point [they massed and attacked with the element of surprise](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcVE8FYXoAEtpHU?format=jpg&name=4096x4096), resulting in a strategic level breakthrough that was successfully exploited all the way to the Svatove Kreminna line, which the Russians rallied at after their retreat. \n\nThe battle of Bakhmut, be it the defense from August '23 to May '24, or the counterattack from June to Oct '24, was a totally different situation. I don't see any real comparisons with 2022. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*That same mindset, to use his own spread out forces to spread the Russians thin too, is what led to Zaluzhny deliberately choosing not to concentrate UAF forces against their 2023 counteroffensive main effort and instead have two large separate supporting axes, Velyka Novosilka and Bakhmut.

The Ukrainians telegraphed the offensive, attacked the Dnieper crossings with GMLRS, but still failed in their attack. They fired the operational commander of the Kherson Bridgehead offensive because he couldn't get results advancing. His replacement barely got results.

In April, why did they attack N to E of Kharkiv City instead? When they did try to cut the Russian GLOC to Izyum over the spring, why were they trying to do it by pushing across Stary Saltiv?\n\nBecause Balakliya wasn't a weak point yet either, it wouldn't be so until the Russians shifted forces over the summer. The Western Military District reinforced the sector around Kharkiv City after the Apr-May counteroffensive, which overextended them in the rest of Kharkiv oblast. Then the Russians shifted the EMD to the South forcing the WMD to extend its frontage even more in the Donbas too. And by mid August they had endured attrition they couldn't sustain. THAT'S where the weak point in Kharkiv came from. That's why Rosgvardia were on the front line holding Balakliya, because there was nobody else left at that point. \n\nThe Ukrainians were smart to hit it in September, but it wasn't some sort of 4D chess move dating back to the Spring, it was flexibility after cancelling the Melitopol thrust but still needing an offensive supporting operation to accompany the strategic main effort in the Kherson Bridgehead. They went searching for a good area to attack, found one in OC-E. \n\n>That bridge was indestructible from artillery strikes.\n\nThe Antonovsky Bridge was hit and disabled for all vehicle traffic using GMLRS by late July. They also disabled the Nova Kakhovka dam bridge too, though the Russians temporarily got that one working again.\n\n>Launching opportunistic strikes was not going to prevent flow of equipment over it.\n\nStriking the only fixed crossing points across the Dnieper tends to limit the flow of manpower and equipment. \n\nHence the reason the Ukrainians want to destroy the Kerch Bridge too. \n\n>We saw evidence of that when the RU pulled out.\n\nYeah, after it became evident they could still support themselves with pontoon ferries. Which was obviously not what they planned for. Hence why there fired the 3 star general responsible for conducting the offensive. \n\n>And why would Surovikin need to see the evidence of a strike to know that the AFU could hit it? It's obvious. \n\nBecause Putin, Shoigu, Gerasimov, Zhidko, and Surovikin won't be motivated to reinforce the Kherson bridgehead if they're already worrying about their chief crossing points BEFORE moving reinforcements across.\n\nStriking the bridge didn't bait a trap, it springs it early, that's a deterrent message: \"You're about to have major issues with your supply lines, you shouldn't fight here.\" Bait is an enticement, not dissuasion.\n\nAnd they needed a deterrent,, because the telegraphing of the offensive caused the Russians to reinforce the South, which was obviously not what the UAF wanted. That was their main effort. So they had to come up with ways to mitigate the risk. If the Russians are trying to cross the river to reinforce the west, to stop that they need to disable the bridges. So that's what they did. \n\n>Most important I think the reason the AFU would have no qualms in displaying that they could hit the bridge or inviting the Russians to fight there was this\n\nThose are conflating.

The UAF didn't want the Russians on the wrong bank and that's why they tried to stop it. When they failed, launched the assault anyway, they made shit progress for three months, fired a general, lost a bunch of forces, but luckily saved by the Kharkiv counteroffensive.

There is no victory on the battlefield and, to be sure, Ukrainian forces are rapidly losing their positions. This is an inevitable process.\"**\n\n> Americans, Peskov said, \"are truly in the first instance beginning to ask themselves the question: just what are they spending this money on?\"\n\n> **With substantial funding up in the air, Peskov referred to Biden's announcement of a $200 million aid allocation, saying it was \"quite a modest sum in their thinking\".**\n\n> **\"This of course puts the Kyiv regime in difficulty and we are going to be following this situation,\" he said.**\n\n> Twenty-one months into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and a year after Ukraine regained large chunks of occupied territory, the front lines have changed little in recent weeks. Zelenskiy rejects any notion that the war is in a stalemate but acknowledges that a Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in June with Western support has made limited progress.\n\n> **Peskov, interviewed by the Russia 24 television channel, said Ukraine had promised \"phenomenal victories\" in the counteroffensive launched as spring weather improved.**\n\n> **\"But the snow went away and nothing happened.

There is no victory on the battlefield and, to be sure, Ukrainian forces are rapidly losing their positions. This is an inevitable process.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Americans, Peskov said, &quot;are truly in the first instance beginning to ask themselves the question: just what are they spending this money on?&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>With substantial funding up in the air, Peskov referred to Biden&#39;s announcement of a $200 million aid allocation, saying it was &quot;quite a modest sum in their thinking&quot;.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;This of course puts the Kyiv regime in difficulty and we are going to be following this situation,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Twenty-one months into Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and a year after Ukraine regained large chunks of occupied territory, the front lines have changed little in recent weeks. Zelenskiy rejects any notion that the war is in a stalemate but acknowledges that a Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in June with Western support has made limited progress.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Peskov, interviewed by the Russia 24 television channel, said Ukraine had promised &quot;phenomenal victories&quot; in the counteroffensive launched as spring weather improved.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;But the snow went away and nothing happened. And the snow fell again and still there is nothing. And Americans are asking, should they still be doing this?&quot; Peskov said.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Biden told Zelenskiy during talks on Tuesday that he would not walk away from Ukraine and nor would the American people.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. lawmakers pursued debate on Wednesday on the question of providing aid to Ukraine and Israel, with Republicans tying both issues to a U.S. border security deal.</p>\n\n<p>Zelenskiy&#39;s visit to Washington ended with no commitment for more U.S. support for Ukraine.

The Duma adopted a law that allows Rosgvardia to create and use volunteer formations at the decision of Russian President Vladimir Putin and stipulates that these formations will perform certain unspecified defense tasks during periods of mobilization, martial law, conditions of armed conflict, and special military operations.[89] The Duma also approved a law allowing Russian conscripts to serve in the FSB Border Service.[90] The Duma approved another bill that introduces criminal penalties for discrediting Rosgvardia volunteers, similar to existing laws against discrediting the Russian military and irregular formations, and for providing assistance to countries that prosecute Rosgvardia volunteers.[91]\n\n> Putin signed a law on December 12 that provides additional recruitment incentives and social support for Russians who serve in Ukraine. The new law amends the Russian employment code to provide Russians who serve in Ukraine and their families the right to priority employment.[92] This preferential labor law may also support ongoing Russian efforts to address domestic labor shortages. Putin also signed a law providing companies that employ Russian veterans of the war in Ukraine and FSB veterans with a special \u201csocial enterprise\u201d status likely to incentivize Russian enterprises to employ Russian war veterans to also address domestic labor shortages.[93]\n\n**Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> Russian sources claimed that Russia has begun mass production of a new type of attack drone. Russian sources, including a prominent state-affiliated propagandist, claimed on December 12 that Russia has begun mass producing the \u201cTermite\u201d helicopter-type drone armed with 80mm missiles with a target engagement range of up to six kilometers.[94] Ukrainian military analyst Alexander Kovalenko stated on December 1 that the \u201cTermite\u201d drones do not threaten Ukrainian forces as they are larger and slower than Shahed drones, which makes them easy targets for Ukrainian forces to shoot down.[95]\n\n**Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\n\n> Russian occupation authorities continue to use the Kremlin-funded pseudo-volunteer \u201cDvizheniye Pervykh\u201d (Movement of the First) youth organization to indoctrinate Ukrainian youth in occupied Ukraine with Russian and cultural national identities. Sevastopol occupation governor Mikhail Razvozhaev posted footage on December 12 showing him giving Russian passports to young members of the Movement of the First organization in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea.[96] The Movement of the First organization is responsible for establishing youth education programs in Russia and occupied Ukraine aimed at militarizing and indoctrinating youth and reportedly has 67 branches in occupied Zaporizhia Oblast alone.[97]\n\n**Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\n\n> Russian government officials continue attempts to exacerbate alleged tensions between Ukrainian political and military leaders. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova reiterated claims on December 12 that the West is considering removing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and replacing him with another senior Ukrainian military or political official.[98] Zakharova added that a new leader of Ukraine would not change the situation in Ukraine \u201cin any way,\u201d however. Zakharova\u2019s addition likely attempts to justify Russia\u2019s continued maximalist goals in Ukraine while furthering attempts to promote internal Ukrainian political tensions.\n\n> Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Head Alexander Bortnikov reiterated a longstanding information operation that Ukrainian and Western intelligence services are responsible for the increase in \u201cterrorist\u201d activities in Russia and aim to spread \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d ideology to foment mass unrest.[99] Bortnikov also suggested that Ukrainian special services were involved in a recent school shooting in Russia, a claim that Russian milbloggers parroted shortly after the incident.[100]\n\n**Significant activity in Belarus (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)**\n\n> Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on December 12 ratifying a Russian-Belarusian agreement on the creation and operation of joint combat training centers.[101] Russia opened permanent training centers in Belarus in 2021 and has used the centers and joint military exercises with Belarusian forces to support a permanent Russian military presence in Belarus.[102]",

                "body": "**Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\n\nSee topline text.\n\nTopline text:\n\n**The Kremlin appears to be returning to expansionist rhetoric last observed before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in an effort to resurface its claims that Ukraine is part of historically Russian territory and discuss the borders Russian leaders regard as appropriate for a rump Ukrainian state.** \n> Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev misrepresented US President Joe Biden\u2019s response to a media question about whether the United States\u2019 policy is to win the war or help Ukraine to defend itself during a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on December 12.[1] Biden stated that the United States wants to see Ukraine win and that \u201cwinning means Ukraine is a sovereign, independent nation [\u2026] that can afford to defend itself today and deter further aggression.\u201d Medvedev misrepresented Biden\u2019s statements to suggest that the United States would be content if Ukraine simply existed as a country but does not care what Ukraine\u2019s borders look like.[2] Medvedev claimed that Ukraine can still technically be a sovereign country if the whole country remains within the borders of Lviv Oblast, for example.[3] Medvedev also falsely claimed that Biden implied that the United States only supports Ukraine in defending itself but will not help Kyiv launch counteroffensives to liberate more of its land and people. Medvedev added that Ukraine could hypothetically \u201cdefend itself\u201d as a rump state within the borders of Lviv Oblast.\n\n> Medvedev routinely and deliberately makes outlandish statements, but the timing of these statements and focus on the idea that Ukraine could exist only as a rump state within the territory of Lviv Oblast is consistent with earlier indicators that the Kremlin is returning to its domestic framing that Russia is fighting the war to \u201cliberate its historic lands.\u201d Medvedev\u2019s comments follow shortly after Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova\u2019s December 9 interview with AFP, which had likely marked an official rhetorical shift in the Kremlin\u2019s framing of the war.[4] Zakharova reiterated the Kremlin\u2019s maximalist demands for full Ukrainian political capitulation and Kyiv\u2019s acceptance of Russia\u2019s military terms and introduced a vague prerequisite that Ukraine must withdraw its troops from \u201cRussian territory\u201d to resolve the war. ISW assessed at the time that Zakharova was likely referring to the illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions \u2013 which are not fully under Russia\u2019s occupation.[5] Zakharova\u2019s statement, however, may have been purposely vague to allow Russia the freedom to define what it deems to be \u201cRussian territories.\u201d Medvedev\u2018s and Zakharova\u2019s comments closely parallel Russia\u2019s long-standing information operation that Ukraine could be partitioned into Russian-controlled \u201cMalorossiya\u201d (most of Ukraine) and a small rump Polish-controlled western Ukraine.[6] ISW observed Russian propagandists intensify this information operation in the lead-up to the full-scale invasion and its notable decrease from then until now.\n\n**The return of the Kremlin\u2019s notion of a \u201cpartitioned Ukraine\u201d is likely an organized effort to mislead the international community into rejecting key components of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty: its territorial integrity as defined in 1991 and its right to self-determination.** \n> ISW assessed that the Kremlin used similar information operations in late 2021 and early 2022 to create conditions for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine while misleading the West into the search for a diplomatic de-escalation.[7] Russia is still pursuing its maximalist objective of controlling all of Ukraine and is using these information operations to deter further military aid to Ukraine and to stall for time needed to rebuild its defense industrial complex (DIB) and reconstitute its military.\n\n**Medvedev\u2019s musings and Zakharova\u2019s statement considered in the context of the information operations the Kremlin used before the full-scale invasion cast serious doubt on the notion that Moscow would be satisfied even with all the territory of the four Ukrainian oblasts it has illegally annexed, let alone with where the front lines currently stand. It is also noteworthy that the Kremlin appears to be revising its explicit territorial aims upward as US support for Ukraine appears to waver and Western voices reportedly argue for pressing Ukraine to offer territorial concessions.**\n\n**A Russian \u201cStorm-Z\u201d assault unit instructor complained that deputy commanders of Russian irregular armed formations are spreading illogical and false claims that present an overly optimistic view of the situation on the front in the Russian media and information space.** \n\n> The instructor stated that an unnamed Russian deputy commander of a \u201cRussian Volunteer Corps\u201d detachment \"fooled\u201d a \u201cserious\u201d media outlet by stating that volunteer units cut the last Ukrainian supply route near Bakhmut and Soledar (northeast of Bakhmut) and that taking control of this area would open up a route for Russian forces to advance to Kramatorsk.[19] The instructor stated that another deputy commander of a Volunteer Corps unit claimed that Ukrainian forces are abandoning their fortifications near Chasiv Yar (10km west of Bakhmut) and do not control the roads in the area and that these conditions will allow Russian forces to advance to Bohdanivka (5km northwest of Bakhmut) and create a \u201chorseshoe\u201d around Chasiv Yar. The deputy commander effectively claimed that Russian forces were threatening a settlement significantly further from their current lines to achieve a tactical victory in a contested area near Russian positions. The instructor stated that these various claims and forecasts were illogical and questioned if the deputy commanders had confused the names of settlements when making their assessments.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Russian Information Operations and Narratives</strong></p>\n\n<p>See topline text.</p>\n\n<p>Topline text:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Kremlin appears to be returning to expansionist rhetoric last observed before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in an effort to resurface its claims that Ukraine is part of historically Russian territory and discuss the borders Russian leaders regard as appropriate for a rump Ukrainian state.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev misrepresented US President Joe Biden\u2019s response to a media question about whether the United States\u2019 policy is to win the war or help Ukraine to defend itself during a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on December 12.[1] Biden stated that the United States wants to see Ukraine win and that \u201cwinning means Ukraine is a sovereign, independent nation [\u2026] that can afford to defend itself today and deter further aggression.\u201d Medvedev misrepresented Biden\u2019s statements to suggest that the United States would be content if Ukraine simply existed as a country but does not care what Ukraine\u2019s borders look like.[2] Medvedev claimed that Ukraine can still technically be a sovereign country if the whole country remains within the borders of Lviv Oblast, for example.[3] Medvedev also falsely claimed that Biden implied that the United States only supports Ukraine in defending itself but will not help Kyiv launch counteroffensives to liberate more of its land and people. Medvedev added that Ukraine could hypothetically \u201cdefend itself\u201d as a rump state within the borders of Lviv Oblast.</p>\n\n<p>Medvedev routinely and deliberately makes outlandish statements, but the timing of these statements and focus on the idea that Ukraine could exist only as a rump state within the territory of Lviv Oblast is consistent with earlier indicators that the Kremlin is returning to its domestic framing that Russia is fighting the war to \u201cliberate its historic lands.\u201d Medvedev\u2019s comments follow shortly after Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova\u2019s December 9 interview with AFP, which had likely marked an official rhetorical shift in the Kremlin\u2019s framing of the war.[4] Zakharova reiterated the Kremlin\u2019s maximalist demands for full Ukrainian political capitulation and Kyiv\u2019s acceptance of Russia\u2019s military terms and introduced a vague prerequisite that Ukraine must withdraw its troops from \u201cRussian territory\u201d to resolve the war. ISW assessed at the time that Zakharova was likely referring to the illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions \u2013 which are not fully under Russia\u2019s occupation.[5] Zakharova\u2019s statement, however, may have been purposely vague to allow Russia the freedom to define what it deems to be \u201cRussian territories.\u201d Medvedev\u2018s and Zakharova\u2019s comments closely parallel Russia\u2019s long-standing information operation that Ukraine could be partitioned into Russian-controlled \u201cMalorossiya\u201d (most of Ukraine) and a small rump Polish-controlled western Ukraine.[6] ISW observed Russian propagandists intensify this information operation in the lead-up to the full-scale invasion and its notable decrease from then until now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The return of the Kremlin\u2019s notion of a \u201cpartitioned Ukraine\u201d is likely an organized effort to mislead the international community into rejecting key components of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty: its territorial integrity as defined in 1991 and its right to self-determination.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ISW assessed that the Kremlin used similar information operations in late 2021 and early 2022 to create conditions for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine while misleading the West into the search for a diplomatic de-escalation.[7] Russia is still pursuing its maximalist objective of controlling all of Ukraine and is using these information operations to deter further military aid to Ukraine and to stall for time needed to rebuild its defense industrial complex (DIB) and reconstitute its military.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Medvedev\u2019s musings and Zakharova\u2019s statement considered in the context of the information operations the Kremlin used before the full-scale invasion cast serious doubt on the notion that Moscow would be satisfied even with all the territory of the four Ukrainian oblasts it has illegally annexed, let alone with where the front lines currently stand. It is also noteworthy that the Kremlin appears to be revising its explicit territorial aims upward as US support for Ukraine appears to waver and Western voices reportedly argue for pressing Ukraine to offer territorial concessions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A Russian \u201cStorm-Z\u201d assault unit instructor complained that deputy commanders of Russian irregular armed formations are spreading illogical and false claims that present an overly optimistic view of the situation on the front in the Russian media and information space.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The instructor stated that an unnamed Russian deputy commander of a \u201cRussian Volunteer Corps\u201d detachment &quot;fooled\u201d a \u201cserious\u201d media outlet by stating that volunteer units cut the last Ukrainian supply route near Bakhmut and Soledar (northeast of Bakhmut) and that taking control of this area would open up a route for Russian forces to advance to Kramatorsk.[19] The instructor stated that another deputy commander of a Volunteer Corps unit claimed that Ukrainian forces are abandoning their fortifications near Chasiv Yar (10km west of Bakhmut) and do not control the roads in the area and that these conditions will allow Russian forces to advance to Bohdanivka (5km northwest of Bakhmut) and create a \u201chorseshoe\u201d around Chasiv Yar. The deputy commander effectively claimed that Russian forces were threatening a settlement significantly further from their current lines to achieve a tactical victory in a contested area near Russian positions. The instructor stated that these various claims and forecasts were illogical and questioned if the deputy commanders had confused the names of settlements when making their assessments. The instructor compared the claims about creating a \u201chorseshoe\u201d around Chasiv Yar to repeated Russian claims that Russian forces have done the same around Avdiivka \u2014 claims which the instructor sarcastically noted have not prevented Russian forces from continually dying in the area.

Though the Ukrainian figures and persistent reports of a significant manpower advantage suggest the actual figure is indeed quite high, and more than sufficient to offset casualties (200-300k?).</p>\n</div>",
