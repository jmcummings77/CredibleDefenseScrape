The other half came in during the spring 2022, so their home stations would have be rather sparse of officers especially needed to train them in whatever. In all honesty I have no clue what they're doing but their state of readiness can't be that high because there isn't much left to train them or equip them, the priority on both of those seems to be Ukraine. At a guess they're technically being used as a strategic reserve in case a war with NATO breaks out. \n\nIt's asinine but done because Putin doesn't have the political capital to mobilize for war the way Ukraine did. So they're left with half ass measures that are largely designed to prevent disaster in the immediate short term but have no long term planning and that often end up biting them in the ass down the road. To put it in perspective, the US military personnel planning during WW2 was at least a year out, and in the GWOT was 2-3 years out. The Russians might have extended it after the September mobilization to a few months but before that it was basically one month in the future and that's it, they really were making things up as they went along hoping the war would end quickly.",

In all honesty I have no clue what they&#39;re doing but their state of readiness can&#39;t be that high because there isn&#39;t much left to train them or equip them, the priority on both of those seems to be Ukraine. At a guess they&#39;re technically being used as a strategic reserve in case a war with NATO breaks out. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s asinine but done because Putin doesn&#39;t have the political capital to mobilize for war the way Ukraine did. So they&#39;re left with half ass measures that are largely designed to prevent disaster in the immediate short term but have no long term planning and that often end up biting them in the ass down the road. To put it in perspective, the US military personnel planning during WW2 was at least a year out, and in the GWOT was 2-3 years out. The Russians might have extended it after the September mobilization to a few months but before that it was basically one month in the future and that&#39;s it, they really were making things up as they went along hoping the war would end quickly.</p>\n</div>",

                        "body": "I think its worth considering *what kind* of maneuver battalions the Russians have massed around Bakhmut. Post mobilization the Russians aren't lacking for trench fillers, especially with Wagner draining prisons. And 40 rifle bns aren't that many men, all things considered. The real question is equipment, and Progozhin himself has complained about the lack of IFV transfers to Wagner-- i.e. we may well be talking about a good deal of 1960's era battle taxied infantry. Given that Wagner has ballooned in sized, it wouldn't be improbable that they are providing a majority of the rifle bns in the sector.\n\nAs for when and why?\n\n(1) Bakhmut became increasingly important as a way to pull Ukrainian forces away from Svatove-Kreminna. A mission which has proven successful. This also explains:\n\n(2) Why Russian increases in fighting power haven't lead to improvements-- the Ukrainians have matched them in terms of force investment in the region. There's a fuckton of Ukrainian brigades currently involved along that front.\n\n(3) The mass expansion of Wagner also explains why the fighting has primarily been at the platoon-company level. Wagner has massively expanded over the past 7-8 months, especially post-prison drive, yet this has primarily been an infusion of low quality manpower. They don't have the officer cadres to turn the men into more capable formations and I also don't think they really need/want to.

Post mobilization the Russians aren&#39;t lacking for trench fillers, especially with Wagner draining prisons. And 40 rifle bns aren&#39;t that many men, all things considered. The real question is equipment, and Progozhin himself has complained about the lack of IFV transfers to Wagner-- i.e. we may well be talking about a good deal of 1960&#39;s era battle taxied infantry.

I bring up the Germans and Russians to highlight the difference in capabilities. The 1941 Wehrmacht was its peak effectiveness, undoubtedly the finest army in the world at that moment. The Red Army had been purged, but also had expanded several fold in size since 1939, and was going through a major reorganization after Finland. Basically it was in the worst shape imaginable.

And to put those numbers in perspective again, on paper that&#39;s 7x BMP battalions, 7x BTR battalions, that was used against a line held by dogshit, with no reserve, giant gaps, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Against the fortified line in Zaporizhzhia, defended in depth and actually manned, if the UAF intends to rely on Brads to actually create breaches they&#39;d need a hell of a lot more than several battalions...</p>\n</div>",

I don't think Bradleys/Abrams or any other IFV/MBTs are going to be good against Russian artillery, but let's hope I'm wrong.\n\nWhat I think makes a difference for Ukraine are drones and long-range PGMs (GMLRS, Excalibur).

That same Foreign Legion corruption news you're talking about was shared by me on this subreddit. The Georgian Legion shooting those Russian POWs early on in this war? It was the first bit of combatfootage I ever shared. The last bit of combatfootage that I shared? The video of the Ukranian soldier getting killed in Bakhmut from mortar shelling. The U.S. wanting to audit its weapons donations to Ukraine, painting things in a less than flattering light? I was the only person that shared that story on this subreddit. \n\nBut through this conflict, there have been things that I've posted here that have subsequently proven to be from less than credible sources. During the fight for Sievierodonetsk, there was a reporter from the Rolling Stone by the name of Seth Harp who shared a text message from an American that was extremely critical of Ukranian forces. Had never heard of this reporter, so Googled him and learned that he had covered murders at Fort Bragg. Thought, okay, cool, this seems like a good source. This was the post:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sethharpesq/status/1538265828134887424/photo/1\n\nTurns out, guy had done an interview where he had previously claimed that there was no \"Foreign Legion\" fighting in Ukraine and that it was a myth, that he had gone to Ukraine specifically to cover the conflict from a different POV because Western coverage had been too sympathetic to the Ukranian cause. Again, *his* words, not mine. He also had tweets about bioweapons labs. Okay, maybe not greatest source, but perhaps it's not the worst, right? The story could still be true despite his own proclivities. Turns out, shortly after he posted that screencap, someone (a media personality, not sure who) accuses him of fabricating the texts. He turns his Twitter private, and no one discusses the story again. \n\nWhat's the moral of the story? Be wary of any freelance \"journalist\" operating in a war zone. That was essentially the same approach I took to this Youtuber. Low subscriber count, low views, a video from October that just happens to be posted on this subreddit three months after the fact? Yeah, color me suspicious, especially when the only other video I see from this Youtuber is a regurgitation of Russian talking points. Even still, I asked questions. OP was free to answer them, or not. That's how an open subreddit works. \n\nSo, no, I don't think sharing this video has any risk of endangering popular support for this war. This is a tiny, TINY subreddit and nothing we discuss here makes an iota of a difference. You're the only one under the delusion that it does. And as I've said before, let me say again just for your clarity, I have ZERO problems believing that there are Nazis in Ukranian ranks. I have ZERO problems in believing that Ukraine was an extremely corrupt nation. I have ZERO problems in verified and true accounts being shared here, no matter which narrative it suits.",

            "body": "As others have said, an infantry platoon is not a self sufficient force, and so it needs to always be working with supporting platoons and higher echelons to accomplish its mission. A platoon in intense action may not last an hour, depending on how well its ammunition is stockpiled and whether incoming fire would leave much of a platoon alive. At that level even a few bad unlucky rounds could render the unit combat incapable. This is especially true of the platoon & company on the attack, where they would likely be given a very specific mission and then  when that is completed they rotate onto a second objective with some amount of 'down time,' be that marching, or driving, or whatever. Very frequently in the attack, maneuver schemes use a sort of leapfrog design (this is even more true of armor btw) where one platoon, or elements of several, holds a base of fire while a second force moves to the flank and launches an attack. This *could* be very intense, in which case ammunition is an issue. Or it may involve several minutes or more of down time between the start time, the maneuver phase, and the final assault. \n\nAt this level there really is no answer to your question because so much of it is 'it depends.' The general rule is that actual combat, guns shooting at dudes, is very intense and unsustainable. A unit may sit in a position all day and only have ten minutes of intense combat. To give a historic example, most armies in the Civil War hoped for two good volleys a minute. This would slow down to one volley every minute or every 1.5min as soldiers wore down. They typically had 20-30 round cartridge boxes. Therefore a unit could only fight unsupported in an engagement about half an hour before they were combat ineffective, casualties aside. Today, the M4 can sustain 15ish RPM for sustained fire, obviously it can do a hell of a lot better but then you have to worry about trashing the gun. An M249 can do about 100RPM sustained. An M249 holds, what, 200 rounds in a 5lb box drum. So 2 min of sustained shooting. Typical load for a Machinegunner is 1000-1500 rounds which is, what, 30lbs just of spare ammo. And that buys you 15 min in a combat scenario. Tho even at a low rate of fire I bet youd wreck the barrel before you burn through all the ammo. I bring all this up to say that actually without support or relief infantry cant hang in an intense firefight for very long, though the attacker cant press very long either. You see many battles drag on hours or days though, and this is because most of 'combat' is less intense, less frenetic, and more quiet than the 'mad minute' kind of fighting. It has to be because forces cant sustain themselves very long. This also indicates the kind of operation a platoon needs to be assigned, basically the unit can only take or hold one major object before needing to be relieved and resupplied. \n\nOn the battalion level this is a little different. Battalions, especially these days, *can* fight independently. The US and NATO have become increasingly big on these battalion groupings. Russia tried an the failure of their BTGs is a big factor in the early war woes. Battalions anymore are the smallest unit which can undertake any kind of operational scale maneuver, that is moving from tactical objective to tactical objective. My experience is more in the Cold War, I know for a fact that the modern battalion grouping is more resilient than then, so ymmv. But generally a battalion would be assigned one 'big' objective at a time, take OBJ Saber, for example, and thats a major tactical location which can be turned into something even bigger. Then the battalion commander breaks the operation down into smaller company sized objectives. He turns his battalion into mini task forces, and then each one of those works in a maneuver scheme to take or hold a key objective. Each company sized group would get a few of these objectives I mentioned above re: platoon combat. They then build up to the decisive battle which enables the conquest of the bigger objective. \n\nA battalion could expect to be in action all day, and to take one or two of these big objectives. Tho with rest. Or they may have to hold a position indefinitely, rotating as frequently as possible. But each unit within the battalion structure would (hopefully) not be in constant combat. Rather, they would engage in a scheme which put some units forward first, then used the reserve to carry on the operation while the first units rested and regenerated. Theoretically though, the battalion would itself want to pause and rest at least every night, the Cold War era manuals pretty much always start with the movement out of a laager or end with the construction of a fixed position. Because the expectation is that once the battalion takes, say, OBJ Saber a follow on battalion will translate that tactical victory into the operational success. But I would also point out that this is *NOT* how the Soviets planned to fight, they were way more willing to keep feeding the same unit into the meatgrinder. A battalion in a regiment's forward detachment might fight a half dozen or more times in a day, wearing itself down till it was used up and rotated to the regimental rear. The goal for them was 'always forward'. \n\nWhich is also why even here the answer is 'it really depends.' Depends on what theyre doing, what the tactical and operational situation is, what the enemy's attack and fire plan is, and what kind of support a unit at any level can expect. As I pointed out above, a  unit cant really hang out forever without more ammo, guns, and (the one thing I didnt point out!) rest. But if everything is working well and the guys are well supported, they can hang out for days in a trench position before needing to be rotated backwards, and a battalion could operate for months in the same position until victory is achieved.",

                    "body": "This highlights a lot of what I was talking about, thanks. \n\nWhat I would say to OP or others is that OBJ Alexandria, in the vid, would become a probable rallying point for the battalion, you see one company of armor conduct a pursuit action but the others would move onto the objective, secure it, and then the battalion commander would likely want to drag up resupply for the next movement. A very similar situation is described in FM 72-1. \n\nBut again, tactical situation. If the resistance is light and the battalion commander feels like he can push hard, he may elect to do so. Conversely, if the forward companies come under a heavy counterattack the battalion might be constrained to its objective, and may not even get an opportunity to refit. IIRC the FM suggests a resupply effort is a 30-60 min affair, would involve refueling, taking on more ammo, and clearing casualties. You *might* also be able to pull a stuck vehicle out.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This highlights a lot of what I was talking about, thanks. </p>\n\n<p>What I would say to OP or others is that OBJ Alexandria, in the vid, would become a probable rallying point for the battalion, you see one company of armor conduct a pursuit action but the others would move onto the objective, secure it, and then the battalion commander would likely want to drag up resupply for the next movement. A very similar situation is described in FM 72-1. </p>\n\n<p>But again, tactical situation. If the resistance is light and the battalion commander feels like he can push hard, he may elect to do so. Conversely, if the forward companies come under a heavy counterattack the battalion might be constrained to its objective, and may not even get an opportunity to refit. IIRC the FM suggests a resupply effort is a 30-60 min affair, would involve refueling, taking on more ammo, and clearing casualties. You <em>might</em> also be able to pull a stuck vehicle out. But not more serious repairs, nor replacements. Also important, a mechanized infantry unit carries more ammunition in their vehicles, and so can sustain longer operations so long as they reconnect with their vehicles periodically. </p>\n\n<p>Good vid tho I like it.</p>\n</div>",

A low intensity contact on the defensive (occasional mortar fire, some enemy recon detachments, occasional raids to disrupt the enemy) could be maintained with a single forward squad and one squad in QRF reserve and leave the third (or 4th) platoon have rest, allowing for continuous replacement/relief within the platoon.

A senior administration official said that Bradleys could be included in a package of weapons to be announced as soon as this week.\n\n>Earlier Wednesday, France said it would provide Ukraine with an unspecified number of light tanks.\n\n>The first supply of Western mobile armor is another major milestone in the escalating provision of advanced weaponry to Ukrainian forces, including heavy artillery and long-range precision rocket launchers. It comes just weeks after the Biden administration announced that it would supply Kyiv with a Patriot missile battery, the most sophisticated air defense weapon in the U.S. arsenal, to defend against waves of Russian missile and drone attacks on energy and civilian infrastructure far from the front line.\n\n>That line, where the Ukrainian military is engaged in a grueling fight for incremental gains against Russian ground forces, is spread for hundreds of miles along a north-south front in the eastern part of the country. U.S. officials have said the Ukrainians need the ability to conduct combined arms maneuvers, with armored vehicles allowing them to engage the enemy and move forward while under fire.\n\n>The United States assesses that \"there will be continued fighting along that line .\u2009.\u2009. for the foreseeable future,\" a second senior administration official said, with little expectation that combat will slow during the winter months. In a shift from training only small units to operate specific weapons systems, the allies are now pulling thousands of Ukrainian soldiers off the front lines for combined maneuver training in Europe.\n\n>But until now, Ukraine's allies have rebuffed Kyiv, arguing that the Western armor is too logistically complicated to be useful.\n\n>Germany has repeatedly turned down Ukrainian requests for its Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Leopard 2 main battle tanks, largely on grounds that it didn't want to be the first to provide such weaponry.\n\n>Much of the West's hesitation to send advanced armaments has revolved around reluctance to provoke Russia to escalate the war. Decisions to send systems such as HIMARS, the U.S. precision rocket launchers that were first transferred last summer, have come as the situation on the battlefield \"evolved,\" the second administration official said.\n\n>As expected, each advancement in arming Ukraine has brought charges from Russian President Vladimir Putin that NATO is actively fighting a war against Russia. But it is Moscow's brutality, especially attacks against civilians, that has made the West more forward-leaning, administration officials counter.\n\n>>\"Let's just be crystal clear here,\" the second official said angrily. \"Mr. Putin can claim all he wants that this is a war by the West,\" and he is fighting \"essentially for [Russia's] security. .\u2009.\u2009. We all know this is a bunch of BS. This is a Russian war of aggression on Ukraine.\"\n\n>>\"We are and will continue to provide them the kind of systems to defend themselves,\" this official said.\n\n>The decision to send armored combat vehicles comes just weeks after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urgently appealed for tanks during a lightning visit to Washington late last month. On Wednesday, in his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky hailed the French announcement as \"a clear signal to all our other partners: There is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with Western-style tanks. .\u2009.\u2009. We must put an end to the Russian aggression this year exactly, and not postpone any of the defensive capabilities that can speed up the defeat of the terrorist state.\"\n\n>>\"Modern Western armored vehicles, Western-type tanks are just one of these key capabilities,\" Zelensky said.\n\n>The administration continues to rule out sending even larger Abrams battle tanks, which weigh 55 tons and rely on a turbine engine that guzzles fuel at a drastic rate, said the first official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive issue. They are also prone to breakdowns and require extensive maintenance expertise.\n\n>The battle tanks are so heavy that then-President Trump was dissuaded from plans to include them in the 2019 July Fourth celebration in Washington on grounds that their steel-plate tracks would destroy city streets. The Abrams ultimately stayed in a \"static display\" on rail cars near Anacostia Park, while Trump was flanked by Bradleys for his Independence Day speech.\n\n>The Bradley, while technically not a tank, would offer a significant upgrade for Ukrainian ground forces. Weighing about 28 tons, it travels on tank-like tracks and carries a three-person crew with room for up to six additional soldiers inside. The United States has thousands of the vehicles, and sending an unspecified number to Ukraine would not undercut U.S. inventories.\n\n>Named after Gen. Omar Bradley, a senior U.S. commander during World War II, the Bradley lacks the firepower of the 120mm \"main gun\" cannon fitted on an Abrams. But it is equipped with heavy armor and an array of other weapons, including a 25mm chain gun and M240 machine gun. It is designed to travel up to 35 miles per hour, fast enough to keep up with the Abrams in American combat units.\n\n>France's plan to supply French-made AMX-10 RC light tanks was announced Wednesday after a phone call between Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron. It was not immediately clear how many tanks would be delivered, or when they would arrive.\n\n>The wheeled vehicles have been in service with the French military since 1981 and are being gradually decommissioned and replaced with an updated system. Primarily used for reconnaissance and transporting troops, its 105mm gun is smaller than that of many tanks, but the vehicle is considered highly agile and maneuverable.\n\n>Also on Wednesday, Poland signed a $1.4 billion deal to purchase a second tranche of U.S. Abrams tanks, replacing more than 300 Soviet-era tanks and armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine last summer.\n\n>Ukrainian forces have also added hundreds of captured or abandoned Russian tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and armored personnel carriers to their existing stock of Soviet-era vehicles. But spare parts and ammunition have been hard to find.",
