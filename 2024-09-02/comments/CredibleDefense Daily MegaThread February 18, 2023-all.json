Offensive may grow in intensity over the next few weeks, but he thinks its unlikely to grow in scope beyond these extremely limited objectives. \n* To launch broader offensive, they would need hundreds of thousands more mobilized troops and would've needed to conduct another round of mobilization which they didn't. \n* Russian offensive potential is rather weak: they're rationing ammo and don't have enough junior officers and enlisted personnel for all their new mobiks. \n* Doesn't expect any Russian breakthroughs, these will be grinding fights. He expects Ukraine to pullback from Bakhmut though. \n* He thinks this offensive has been launched for purely political reasons (Putin is impatient with progress so far) and Kofman thinks it's a gift to Ukraine, blowing Russian advantages that Surovikin scraped together on a premature offensive that will leave them exhausted by the end. \n* Sees Ukraine as likely to launch its offensive in late Spring in Zaporizhzhia, sees the risk of Russian counterattack afterwards decreased as Russia will likely be too exhausted to push back. Sees upcoming offensive as Ukraine's best chance to drive on Melitopol and cut Russian lines in half. \n* Kofman has seen evidence over the past week of a growing Ukrainian artillery deficit, sees it as a short to medium term issue, thinks the slow ramp up of Western support is likely to help in the long run. \n* Doesn't expect war to end this year, thinks next 6-8 months will be crucial for Ukraine to prove that Ukraine can still keep taking back more territory and might see the highline of Western aid as Western equipment stockpiles continue to shrink and it will be evaluated if Ukraine will be able to win with current levels of support. \n\nThis was a relatively short (less than 20 min) podcast, highly recommend everyone give it a listen if they have a few minutes. I think the biggest takeaway is that Kofman is convinced that the big Russian offensive many commentators are waiting for actually started 3 weeks ago and is going to be extremely underwhelming. This is in keeping with what he's been saying for weeks now. Russian offensive potential really is extremely limited at this point and they seem to keep squandering it by attacking on too many axes and before they're really ready. \n\nHe also seems convinced that Surovikin's plan was a very good one that would've given Russia much better longterm offensive potential at the cost of several months of relative inactivity by Russian forces and that Putin's impatience is undoing Surovikin's work.",

Both sides need either full air superiority (to get to an Iraq-war level of campaign) or, failing that, far more men and material (tanks, artillery, drones). Neither of which either side have, or have access to procure in rapid numbers, so we'll continue to see these slow, slogging churning offensives. Bakhmut is a perfect example.

At most they&#39;ll send supplies, ammunition and volunteers like what the US is doing today, and then try to manage the refugee situation as best they can. </p>\n\n<p>But the yellow kingdom has a long memory. They&#39;ll forever remember it as their attempt to reproach the west, only for the west to bite them back. This was just after the Belgrade embassy attack as well. So expect alot more industrial espionage, more diplomatic brinkmanship and more economic hostility but meanwhile staying just behind the line such that the US doesn&#39;t impose sanctions.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine has 8 new mech brigades in training or organization, there&#39;s some indication of new marine and air assault brigades in formation and the 4 motorized  brigades still need APCs for their upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:\n<a href=\"https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/02/17/ukrainian-battalion-completes-first-combined-arms-training-in-germany/\">https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/02/17/ukrainian-battalion-completes-first-combined-arms-training-in-germany/</a></p>\n\n<p>This seems to be the original source for the Washington Times article. A little more info</p>\n</div>",

He literally said it out loud. Relying on what are possibly the most egregious extraterritorial unilateral sanctions in history to try and crush a global company. And then they didn't work so they escalated them to insane levels a year later.\n\nTrump sent a dossier to his 'european allies' to try and get them to ban huawei and they laughed him out of the room. The UK explicitly conceded because of trump's demands in the hopes of getting a trade deal with the US post brexit.\n\nSo he just.... entirely on his own.... decided that he would destroy a foreign company.\n\n-------------------\n\nThis was after an extensive US investigation that desparately looked for evidence of huawei spying in 2013 and found nothing. The company had almost no presence in the US market.\n\nThis was after trump had the Huawei CFO arrested in Canada on the most insane charges imaginable. It was part of his leverage in the trade war and the fact that people just lap it all up is utterly mad.\n\nIf they did pose a security risk then do you know what the answer would be? To restrict their presence in the US. The measures used were not the ones you would use if security was your concern.\n\n> Heck, Huawei brags about how their technology can be used for intense mass surveillance.

TSMC, GlobalFoundries, and others have plants where they physically build chips based on projects that their costumers send to them. These costumers are Intel (Intel is also a chip manufacturer), AMD, NVIDIA, Amazon, etc.\n\nThe fact is that when they talk about \"chip wars\" they almost always overlook the \"design part\", implying that the really difficult part, where US and others (SK, Taiwan) have an advantage, is in the manufacturing. Yes, it lies in the manufacturing but also in the design process, that's extremely difficult.\n\nThink of it like this: in the mainstream media discourse, chip production is portrayed as chair production, where the design of a chair is the relatively simple part, while the manufacturing process can be hard (you have to run a modern production plant to produce en mass and to be cost competitive).\n\nWhile actual chip production is something like fighter jet production: extremely difficult to design, to create, and extremely challenging to physically fabricate.\n\nWhy chip design is so difficult is too long to explain here.\n\nBut the fact is that chip design is even more US centric, because virtually all high performance chip producers are US companies.\n\nARM and RISC-V are two chip architectures, or instruction sets, or in this case think of it as the \"grammar\" or language of the operation a chip executes.\n\nARM is an instruction set (or a language), RISC-V another.\n\nBecause it would be unfeasible to re-write all the programs in the world for every processor, very few architectures exist: x86 (that of your PC and almost all the computer world except for smartphones and some more), ARM (smartphones and a bunch of other things) and RISC-V, that's open source.\n\nOpen source in this case basically means that you don't have to pay a license to build your chip to anyone, the architecture is free to use.\n\nSo no US sanctions, in theory, could harm anyone. The fact is that all major companies producing RISC-V chips are US companies, and RISC-V is extremely new and basically non commercially available at the moment (yes you can buy some server chips or dev board, but...).\n\nARM basically needed 30 years to start to gain a foot in the PC/server chips market, in the last 5-10 years after selling tens of billions of chips for smartphones and more, and it will take well into 2030s before it will be widespread adopted along x86 (the current dominant architecture).\n\nWonder how long it will take for RISC-V.

So they\u2019re getting them the arms they need to fight off Russia in their country while Commerce and Treasury are slowing down Russia\u2019s ability to rearm. We\u2019re already seeing a big impact,\u201d Adeyemo told CNN.\n\n> In excerpts of his remarks, Adeyemo makes the case that sanctions and export controls from the US and its allies have degraded the Russian economy.\n\n>\u201cLast year, rather than the forecasted budget surplus, Russia suffered a budget deficit of $47 billion dollars. This was the second highest deficit the country has experienced in the post-Soviet era. Industrial production has declined in Russia for 9 straight months, and we are planning to take further actions to further decimate the Kremlin\u2019s industrial base,\u201d Adeyemo will say.\n\n>Despite the impact sanctions have had on the Russian economy, some observers have pointed to concerns over Moscow\u2019s ability to evade sanctions and re-orient trade routes to continue to acquire some of the technologies and financing needed to fund its war machine through countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and India.\n\n>\u201cSpending the country\u2019s savings can hide the damage for now, but our actions are forcing Russia to mortgage its economic future to save face today. Of course, we have more work to do, and we will continue to do more until Russia\u2019s ceases its baseless and illegal invasion. But one year into this conflict, Russia\u2019s economy looks more like Iran\u2019s than a G-20 country,\u201d Adeyemo will say.\n\n> Adeyemo\u2019s remarks come on the heels of Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson\u2019s trip to the UAE and Turkey last month where he outlined how the department is working to \u201ccrack down\u201d on Russian attempts to evade sanctions and export controls, as well as warn that there are consequences for working with sanctioned entities or not conducting proper due diligence.",

For now, neither version is entirely realistic.  \nDespite his enormous newfound notoriety, Prigozhin is still only   \nacting as a private individual.

He didn\u2019t have the chance to impress the   \npresident at work or as a friend as others did, such as those who worked  \n with Putin in the early years of his career.  \nInstead, Prigozhin\u2019s unique chance arose following the annexation of   \nCrimea. The conflicts in both the Donbas and then Syria, plus Russia\u2019s   \nstandoff with the West, meant that a market emerged for \u201cgray\u201d   \ngeopolitical tactics that unwieldy official institutions would struggle   \nto deliver.

Putin liked this   \napproach, which is also in demand in the war against Ukraine.  \nStill, the businessman\u2019s position remains informal. Putin has agreed   \nto outsource certain state functions but has not legitimized Prigozhin   \nhimself. The president has never seen the shady entrepreneur as a   \nreplacement for official institutions such as the army or security   \nservices, nor has he ever tried to use Prigozhin as a counterbalance to   \nthose institutions, for that would be completely at odds with Putin\u2019s   \nconcept of complete and coordinated power.  \nPrigozhin shot to success not because Putin backed him in an attempt   \nto stop any of the generals getting too high and mighty: there was no   \nsign of that happening. Quite simply, the situation at the front was   \ndisastrous, and needed improving by any means possible.

For a long time, it was believed that the   \ninfluential Kovalchuk brothers were Prigozhin\u2019s informal handlers and   \nhad helped the businessman to forge ties to the presidential   \nadministration.  \nThanks to them, Prigozhin was able to get information about his   \ninitiatives to the president, who, if he liked the idea, would then   \ninformally order the corresponding organs to cooperate, which enabled   \nthe businessman to establish ties at a lower level\u2014while making enemies   \nalong the way.  \nIn Syria, Wagner effectively operated as a contractor for the General Staff, which connected  \n Prigozhin to high-ranking officers of the GRU, Russia\u2019s military   \nintelligence agency\u2014and led to the group\u2019s first conflicts with the   \nDefense Ministry. Meanwhile, Wagner\u2019s presence in various African   \ncountries helped the company to establish special relationships with   \nRussian ambassadors there, which annoyed the Foreign Ministry.  \nMore recently, it is Prigozhin\u2019s unorthodox recruitment methods \u2014   \ntrawling Russian prisons for new mercenaries \u2014 that have ruffled   \nfeathers. His recruitment drive has infuriated the Federal Penitentiary   \nService (FSIN), Justice Ministry, Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, and   \nFederal Security Service (FSB), which worked to have these men locked   \nup, only for them now to be potentially released back into society \u2014 if   \nthey survive the war.  \nBoth Prigozhin\u2019s horizontal connections (the GRU military   \nintelligence agency, FSIN, and governors) and his vertical ties (the   \nKovalchuks, and presidential administration head Anton Vayno) mean that   \nthe businessman is entirely dependent on others, and that his   \nopportunities are limited.

After several months of a   \nhumiliating campaign launched by Prigozhin against them with the help of  \n his media assets, the two defense officials managed to convince the   \npresident that Wagner\u2019s independence was a threat to the army.  \nIn response, Putin put Gerasimov in charge of the whole \u201cspecial   \noperation,\u201d showing just how quickly he can redress a situation and   \nignoring the opinion of both Prigozhin and his adoring military   \nbloggers, along with an entire camp of pro-war activists who openly   \ndespise Gerasimov and Shoigu.  \nThe businessman\u2019s attacks on officials, parliamentary deputies, and   \npolitical parties have not won him any favor within the elite, which considers  \n Prigozhin\u2019s autonomy, ambition, and rhetoric nothing short of a threat   \nto the state. He may have carte blanche from Putin within his area of   \nresponsibility (Wagner\u2019s activities, troll factories, certain minor   \nmedia) but outside of it, he is politically helpless.\u00a0 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \nPrigozhin\u2019s other endeavors are notably less successful: his futile war against St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov, his empty threats  \n to get YouTube blocked in Russia, and his frequent legal defeats. He   \ndoesn\u2019t have his own political instruments, and the openly   \nanti-mainstream political ideas he promotes are radical and manifestly   \nunrealistic. Even his ties to the Kovalchuks are growing looser: their   \nagendas are gradually diverging, and it\u2019s increasingly difficult for the  \n brothers to put in a good word for their prot\u00e9g\u00e9-bulldozer.  \nPrigozhin\u2019s long-standing relationship with the presidential   \nadministration is also beginning to crack. The domestic policy overseers  \n don\u2019t like his political demagogy, his attacks on official   \ninstitutions, or his attempts to troll Putin\u2019s staff by threatening to   \nform a political party, which would be a headache for everyone in the   \nKremlin.  \nIn other words, Prigozhin has no shortage of enemies. Now the   \nsecurity services, for which Prigozhin\u2019s private army packed with   \ncriminals is a major bugbear, have joined the attacks against him, as   \nevidenced by the sharp uptick in criticism of the businessman and Wagner  \n on Telegram channels.\u00a0  \nFinally, Prigozhin\u2019s alleged popularity among ordinary Russians is   \ngreatly exaggerated. In polls examining people\u2019s trust in politicians,   \nhe is hardly ever mentioned: in a Levada Center survey at the end of   \nlast year, just three people out of 1,600 polled named him.  \nStill, none of these difficulties signify Prigozhin\u2019s imminent   \ndownfall. He can still get limited information to Putin, who considers   \nhim a true patriot fighting for the future of the motherland: not always  \n elegantly, but often more effectively than his official rivals.  \nThe intensity and existential nature of the war against Ukraine,   \ncombined with Russia\u2019s lack of victories, has noticeably increased   \nPrigozhin\u2019s political weight. But that in no way makes him particularly   \nclose to Putin.  \nIf anything, the opposite is true: every day, the gap is growing   \nbetween the role that Putin has assigned to Wagner and the place that   \nPrigozhin himself believes he deserves. For the president, a private   \nmilitary company is a convenient asset for any power with geopolitical   \nambitions, but it should operate exclusively in the state\u2019s interests   \nand avoid the limelight. It should not undertake its own initiatives,   \nand it certainly should not have a political agenda.  \nUntil recently, that\u2019s how Prigozhin operated. But now, he hasn\u2019t   \njust become a public figure; he is visibly transforming into a   \nfull-fledged politician with his own views, which are nothing short of   \nrevolutionary.  \nFor now, Prigozhin is not prepared to challenge Putin. But \u2014 and it\u2019s  \n an important \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hard to remain sane and level-headed when   \nyou\u2019ve lost a large part of your personal army to the bloody meat   \ngrinder of war.  \nAs long as Putin is relatively strong and capable of maintaining the   \nbalance between various groups of influence, Prigozhin is not dangerous.  \n But the slightest change could prompt Prigozhin to challenge the   \nauthorities: perhaps not Putin himself, at first. War makes monsters of   \nmen, and their recklessness and desperation can become a challenge to   \nthe state if it shows even the slightest sign of weakness. \n\t\t\t\t  \nhttps://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/02/15/is-wagner-founder-yevgeny-prigozhin-a-threat-or-asset-to-putin-a80235",

Even his ties to the Kovalchuks are growing looser: their<br/>\nagendas are gradually diverging, and it\u2019s increasingly difficult for the<br/>\n brothers to put in a good word for their prot\u00e9g\u00e9-bulldozer.<br/>\nPrigozhin\u2019s long-standing relationship with the presidential<br/>\nadministration is also beginning to crack. The domestic policy overseers<br/>\n don\u2019t like his political demagogy, his attacks on official<br/>\ninstitutions, or his attempts to troll Putin\u2019s staff by threatening to<br/>\nform a political party, which would be a headache for everyone in the<br/>\nKremlin.<br/>\nIn other words, Prigozhin has no shortage of enemies. Now the<br/>\nsecurity services, for which Prigozhin\u2019s private army packed with<br/>\ncriminals is a major bugbear, have joined the attacks against him, as<br/>\nevidenced by the sharp uptick in criticism of the businessman and Wagner<br/>\n on Telegram channels.\u00a0<br/>\nFinally, Prigozhin\u2019s alleged popularity among ordinary Russians is<br/>\ngreatly exaggerated. In polls examining people\u2019s trust in politicians,<br/>\nhe is hardly ever mentioned: in a Levada Center survey at the end of<br/>\nlast year, just three people out of 1,600 polled named him.<br/>\nStill, none of these difficulties signify Prigozhin\u2019s imminent<br/>\ndownfall. He can still get limited information to Putin, who considers<br/>\nhim a true patriot fighting for the future of the motherland: not always<br/>\n elegantly, but often more effectively than his official rivals.<br/>\nThe intensity and existential nature of the war against Ukraine,<br/>\ncombined with Russia\u2019s lack of victories, has noticeably increased<br/>\nPrigozhin\u2019s political weight. But that in no way makes him particularly<br/>\nclose to Putin.<br/>\nIf anything, the opposite is true: every day, the gap is growing<br/>\nbetween the role that Putin has assigned to Wagner and the place that<br/>\nPrigozhin himself believes he deserves. For the president, a private<br/>\nmilitary company is a convenient asset for any power with geopolitical<br/>\nambitions, but it should operate exclusively in the state\u2019s interests<br/>\nand avoid the limelight. It should not undertake its own initiatives,<br/>\nand it certainly should not have a political agenda.<br/>\nUntil recently, that\u2019s how Prigozhin operated. But now, he hasn\u2019t<br/>\njust become a public figure; he is visibly transforming into a<br/>\nfull-fledged politician with his own views, which are nothing short of<br/>\nrevolutionary.<br/>\nFor now, Prigozhin is not prepared to challenge Putin. But \u2014 and it\u2019s<br/>\n an important \u201cbut\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hard to remain sane and level-headed when<br/>\nyou\u2019ve lost a large part of your personal army to the bloody meat<br/>\ngrinder of war.<br/>\nAs long as Putin is relatively strong and capable of maintaining the<br/>\nbalance between various groups of influence, Prigozhin is not dangerous.<br/>\n But the slightest change could prompt Prigozhin to challenge the<br/>\nauthorities: perhaps not Putin himself, at first. War makes monsters of<br/>\nmen, and their recklessness and desperation can become a challenge to<br/>\nthe state if it shows even the slightest sign of weakness. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/02/15/is-wagner-founder-yevgeny-prigozhin-a-threat-or-asset-to-putin-a80235\">https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/02/15/is-wagner-founder-yevgeny-prigozhin-a-threat-or-asset-to-putin-a80235</a></p>\n</div>",
