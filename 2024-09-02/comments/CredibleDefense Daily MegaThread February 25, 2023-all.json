        "body": "It's about time for a check in on the new Ukrainian Armed Forces mechanized brigades.\n\nA familiar unit.\n\nThe 5th Assault Regiment has finally gotten their tank and artillery battalions sorted out, and were officially promoted to the 5th Assault Brigade.  The tank battalion may have been 'home grown', as it is a m\u00e9lange of captured and repurposed Russian armor- Several flavors of T-72B3 and T90As.  I don't know how the artillery group has been constituted, but a few twitter clips of them blowing up crap  droppped over the last couple weeks.\n\nI've yet to hear anything official on the 58th Motorized brigade, besides general statements that the motorized units were slotted to conversion to full mech units. It's been off the line for well over a month at this point, and despite a few rumors it was getting an upgrade, this may just be an extended R&R. \n\nMoving right Along\n\nThe 21st Mech is pretty much there, in extended training. They have deployed a battalion onto the line for seasoning, much like how the new tank brigades cycled their battalions in and out last summer on the Kherson front.\n\nThe 47th Assault Brigade continues training in Germany on the Bradleys. The first battalion has graduated from the combined arms course, the second graduates next week. The 3rd battalion started training, but I have no idea if they are getting bradleys as well- If some other flavor of company command vehicle is used, I guess 109 M-2s could stretch to a brigade.  The Paladins are training at the same base, as are the Brigade's T-55s tanks. It would make maintenance sense for the M-109s to go to the 47th because of common maintenance with the Bradleys, but alas, I have not been consulted......\n\nThe 33rd Mech is in training and should be ready soon, as it is being built around several smaller veteran units. \n\nSomewhere in the mix.\n\nNumerous other brigades are forming. The 13th Jaeger Brigade, the 22nd Mech Brigade, the 23rd Mech Brigade, the 31st Mech Brigade, the 32nd Mech Brigade, the 88th Mech Brigade, the 116th Mech Brigade, the 117th Mech Brigade, and the 118th Mech brigade have all been announced.  \n\n There's rumors of a new tank brigade forming, but it seems aspirational to me- The announced units already need 9 tank battalions, 13 if the motorized brigades are getting big boy suits. Even with 130-160 T-72EAs and various Leo 2s, plus whatever Poland decides they can part with, that's a big ask.  \n\nAs for APCs/IFVs, my math is back of the envelope jottings, trying to reach the 1000 plus vehicles needed.  America has given 300 Bradleys/Strykers/M113s, Britain pledged 200 without specifics, between Sweden, Germany and Norway another 120 have been pledged. Poland, France and Finland have all made non specific pledges, and another 100 or so M113s have been rounded up from various donations/purchases. I'm somewhat disturbed that two aid packages have come and gone without more M-2s (or M109s), but I would be very surprised if the US isn't going to have a second shipment at some point.  There's some speculation that the shortfall may be made up from the plethora of MRAPs - I highly respect the 3 axel variants, but the MAX-PROs, good as they are against mines, really aren't an APC.    Nor can I tell what smaller units are being beefed up to form the brigades: \n The 214th OPFOR Assault  Battalion has been off the line for a while now, as have several of the independent rifle battalions which were active in the Bakmut/Donbas fronts.  Also, the Skala Assault Battalion has appeared as a separate unit on org charts of late- They had been associated with the 93rd Mech as a 4th battalion during the Kharkiv fight.  Either way, I assume Ukraine has a more complete spreadsheet, or they wouldn't have bothered announcing the new brigades!",

The tank battalion may have been &#39;home grown&#39;, as it is a m\u00e9lange of captured and repurposed Russian armor- Several flavors of T-72B3 and T90As.  I don&#39;t know how the artillery group has been constituted, but a few twitter clips of them blowing up crap  droppped over the last couple weeks.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve yet to hear anything official on the 58th Motorized brigade, besides general statements that the motorized units were slotted to conversion to full mech units. It&#39;s been off the line for well over a month at this point, and despite a few rumors it was getting an upgrade, this may just be an extended R&amp;R. </p>\n\n<p>Moving right Along</p>\n\n<p>The 21st Mech is pretty much there, in extended training. They have deployed a battalion onto the line for seasoning, much like how the new tank brigades cycled their battalions in and out last summer on the Kherson front.</p>\n\n<p>The 47th Assault Brigade continues training in Germany on the Bradleys. The first battalion has graduated from the combined arms course, the second graduates next week. The 3rd battalion started training, but I have no idea if they are getting bradleys as well- If some other flavor of company command vehicle is used, I guess 109 M-2s could stretch to a brigade.  The Paladins are training at the same base, as are the Brigade&#39;s T-55s tanks. It would make maintenance sense for the M-109s to go to the 47th because of common maintenance with the Bradleys, but alas, I have not been consulted......</p>\n\n<p>The 33rd Mech is in training and should be ready soon, as it is being built around several smaller veteran units. </p>\n\n<p>Somewhere in the mix.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous other brigades are forming. The 13th Jaeger Brigade, the 22nd Mech Brigade, the 23rd Mech Brigade, the 31st Mech Brigade, the 32nd Mech Brigade, the 88th Mech Brigade, the 116th Mech Brigade, the 117th Mech Brigade, and the 118th Mech brigade have all been announced.  </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s rumors of a new tank brigade forming, but it seems aspirational to me- The announced units already need 9 tank battalions, 13 if the motorized brigades are getting big boy suits. Even with 130-160 T-72EAs and various Leo 2s, plus whatever Poland decides they can part with, that&#39;s a big ask.  </p>\n\n<p>As for APCs/IFVs, my math is back of the envelope jottings, trying to reach the 1000 plus vehicles needed.  America has given 300 Bradleys/Strykers/M113s, Britain pledged 200 without specifics, between Sweden, Germany and Norway another 120 have been pledged. Poland, France and Finland have all made non specific pledges, and another 100 or so M113s have been rounded up from various donations/purchases. I&#39;m somewhat disturbed that two aid packages have come and gone without more M-2s (or M109s), but I would be very surprised if the US isn&#39;t going to have a second shipment at some point.  There&#39;s some speculation that the shortfall may be made up from the plethora of MRAPs - I highly respect the 3 axel variants, but the MAX-PROs, good as they are against mines, really aren&#39;t an APC.    Nor can I tell what smaller units are being beefed up to form the brigades: \n The 214th OPFOR Assault  Battalion has been off the line for a while now, as have several of the independent rifle battalions which were active in the Bakmut/Donbas fronts.  Also, the Skala Assault Battalion has appeared as a separate unit on org charts of late- They had been associated with the 93rd Mech as a 4th battalion during the Kharkiv fight.  Either way, I assume Ukraine has a more complete spreadsheet, or they wouldn&#39;t have bothered announcing the new brigades!</p>\n</div>",

The warlords, under Wagner, promised Putin they could do an offensive now and make the kind of gains that would lead the west to question their commitment. And they could do it now, without any additional commitment. Obviously a seductive argument. Except probably the RUAF was right, and they should have waited.

That source of course is India. It's not like Russia could cut off trade with India either because they are very reliant on trade with India right now and need India more than India needs them. If the US made India a sweetheart deal for F-35s or some other platform could they be persuaded to sell us their old Soviet platforms and then we transfer them to Ukraine?",

They'd not don't even need to strike together, it can be done consecutively because the shock of the first would likely create an operational level emergency for the Russians where they'd need to scramble reserves making the second counterattack potentially more devastating. Even if they didn't break through and chop off the pincers they'd still have forced the Russians to shift from offense to defense and scramble to react, viciously retaking the initiative.\n\nBut if the UAF wanted to do something like that it should have been done months ago. Before they were committing their reserve to relieve in place battered units on the line, they could have instead sent them directly on the attack. Back in mid December there was reported a large scale relief in place with a half dozen or so quality maneuver brigades showing up, those shouldn't have went into the defense, they'd should have went into the attack, though done with as much surprise and shock as possible.\n\nBut they missed the opportunity and by early Feb it seemed clear the Ukrainian GenStab had wrote off the city already. They were relieving quality units and especially their maneuver battalions with TDF to shore up the lines, they were regularly retreating with far less resistance than before, likely planning a phased retreat since late January and finishing up today or tomorrow. \n\nThey're saving their punching power for somewhere else. Maybe they're thinking of the spring but they got a long way to go before then, Russians are on the offensive all over, they can't be wasting capable forces and ammo if they want to have strategic reserve.\n\nLast September, their strongest strategic force was attacking Kherson and not really making much progress. The units involved in the Kharkiv counteroffensive were pulled right from the lines in Kharkiv and the Donbas, some were quite battered, all had been fighting for at least a month some as many as 3-4 or more, and the assault force was only five brigades. \n\nTo break through Zaporizhzhia defensive lines and make a meaningful penetration towards Melitopol (which I doubt they'll reach quickly) with require dozens and dozens of brigades.\n\nJust to describe the complexity of it, from the front lines to Melitopol is 80 kilometers. If they only get halfway there that still creates a salient 80 km long that'll have to be defended against counterattacks while assault brigades are constantly rotated due to casualties and damage they sustain.
