Around 900 junta soldiers had been based in Namkham under No.7 Military Operation Command, according to the Brotherhood Alliance.\n\n>Numerous junta airstrikes and artillery strikes were used to defend the base and attack Namkham town, the alliance said.\n\nOne of the deadliest battles against the Junta.

It said that on Monday evening the junta\u2019s military attacked its base in the Laoxiangtang area of Laukkai Township \u2013 in the south of Kokang Self-Administered Zone \u2013 and that it began defending the base the next day.\n\nThere was believed to be an agreement to hand over Laukkai in exchange for bureaucrats/civilian administration to get out of the city.

They will only be able to do ~20-30% of that in a best case scenario next year. In terms of manpower, they have added ~150k prisoners to the military over the past year.

But to answer your question, Russia fired 10mm shells in 2022. They will only be able to do ~20-30% of that in a best case scenario next year. In terms of manpower, they have added ~150k prisoners to the military over the past year. That\u2019s not something a great power with the ability to sustain manpower needs would resort to.

[Here](https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/177667943.html) is a Russian source, the analysis was posted in 2014; so before the fog of war and massive amounts of propaganda. \n\n>Russia's human development index is similar to that of Romania and Kuwait. But the value of a statistical life in Russia is very low and comparable to that of developing Asian countries.\n\nThe key point:\n\n>The authors estimate that the average value of a statistical life in Russia is about 50 million rubles, or some $1.6 million, which is extremely low and comparable to that of developing Asian countries, while the average human life is valued at $6.7 million in the U.S., at $13 million in the U.K., at $11.9 million in Japan, and at $5.9 million in Sweden.\"The value of a human life in Russia is significantly underestimated,\" the authors conclude.\n\nIt is worth mentioning how big the differences can be, and making an *average* of a country like Russia is going to be very problematic because of those huge differences. That said, I'd bet that these estimates are on the upper bounds in relation to the conflict at hand, because Russia isn't picking up average Russians from the country to send to war; they've heavily been focused on prisoners, and people with financial needs; that's going to skew much lower. In any case, if you take away St.Petersburg and Moscow regions; that average is going to go further down, if you focus on prisoner / low income populations; even more so.\n\nJust to be clear this is no argument from an ethical viewpoint, lots of people think comparing human lives is dehumanizing; and from an individualist perspective it absolutely is. But considering insurances, and bunch of other industries do it; and states act as a conglomerate of sorts in this sort of context when there's active war; it's worth looking at insurance rates for at least a measure to correlate with. \n\nFrom a pure military perspective, this \"low cost\" has its advantages and disadvantages; I think people focusing too much on the ethical side are blindsided by what is at hand. Maybe the regime will have issues drafting people when they have to start picking up people from more prosperous regions, but until then I think it makes more sense to assume they won't have such issues. Preparing for the reality that the regime will collapse because it will hit some recruitment limit is going to leave one very disappointed if it doesn't happen, on the other hand assuming there is (practically) an infinite amount of manpower to contend with; is at worst going to surprise you in a good way if it is not true.",

Instead, he was sent to join an infantry unit depleted by months of hard fighting. His battalion of the 47th Mechanized Brigade is defending the city of Avdiivka against waves of Russian assaults, the biggest current battle in Russia\u2019s relentless war on Ukraine. \n\n\r  \n\u201cPhysically, I can\u2019t handle this,\u201d Dubok said of front-line combat. \u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed that I\u2019m no longer 20.\u201d \n\n\r  \nUkraine needs to rebuild its battered army. The infantry, which bears the brunt of deaths and injuries, is chronically short of men after nearly two years of resisting Russia\u2019s full-blown invasion. \n\nThe most highly motivated fighters volunteered early. Those who haven\u2019t been killed or wounded often say they are exhausted. Ukraine now relies on the draft\u2014and sometimes on rounding up men\u2014to replenish the ranks. Meanwhile, Russia can draw on a much larger population to replace its own heavy losses. \n\nBut a rickety draft system isn\u2019t mobilizing Ukraine\u2019s manpower effectively, providing the quantity and quality of troops needed, or sharing the burden fairly across Ukrainian society, say many soldiers and military analysts. \n\n\r  \nA combination of corruption, exemptions and political caution has protected much of Ukraine\u2019s urban middle class against having to fight in the cold and muddy trenches. On the long front line, a disproportionate share of draftees are middle-aged men like Dubok. Often they are from villages and small towns and were too poor to buy their way out. \r  \nVeteran soldiers who have been fighting since 2022\u2014some since 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine\u2019s east\u2014express frustration that new recruits are often past their physical prime. \n\n\r  \n\u201cThe quality of the replacements is not good.

Instead, he was sent to join an infantry unit depleted by months of hard fighting. His battalion of the 47th Mechanized Brigade is defending the city of Avdiivka against waves of Russian assaults, the biggest current battle in Russia\u2019s relentless war on Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cPhysically, I can\u2019t handle this,\u201d Dubok said of front-line combat. \u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed that I\u2019m no longer 20.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine needs to rebuild its battered army. The infantry, which bears the brunt of deaths and injuries, is chronically short of men after nearly two years of resisting Russia\u2019s full-blown invasion. </p>\n\n<p>The most highly motivated fighters volunteered early. Those who haven\u2019t been killed or wounded often say they are exhausted. Ukraine now relies on the draft\u2014and sometimes on rounding up men\u2014to replenish the ranks. Meanwhile, Russia can draw on a much larger population to replace its own heavy losses. </p>\n\n<p>But a rickety draft system isn\u2019t mobilizing Ukraine\u2019s manpower effectively, providing the quantity and quality of troops needed, or sharing the burden fairly across Ukrainian society, say many soldiers and military analysts. </p>\n\n<p>A combination of corruption, exemptions and political caution has protected much of Ukraine\u2019s urban middle class against having to fight in the cold and muddy trenches. On the long front line, a disproportionate share of draftees are middle-aged men like Dubok. Often they are from villages and small towns and were too poor to buy their way out. </p>\n\n<p>Veteran soldiers who have been fighting since 2022\u2014some since 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine\u2019s east\u2014express frustration that new recruits are often past their physical prime. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe quality of the replacements is not good. They\u2019re rural guys aged 43 to 50, sometimes with health problems,\u201d said an experienced infantryman fighting near Avdiivka. </p>\n\n<p>Tired fighters note bitterly that when they go on leave in big cities such as Kyiv or Dnipro, they see able-bodied men in their 20s and 30s frequenting gyms, bars and hip restaurants. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have full-on mobilization\u201d of society, said a drone operator with the Ukrainian Navy\u2019s special forces, known by his call sign Dobro. \u201cBut it\u2019s a necessity.

The average age of soldiers in the brigades the Offensive Guard for example is quite lowish (compared to the average) afaik, because when they were established there was a massive nationwide enlistment campaign, aimed particularly at the younger folks. The campaign relied heavily on the counteroffensive hype, Western equipment, NATO training, etc. Which proved indeed the best way to attract young people. \n\nDitto for other formations such as the 47th Mechanized Brigade, before it had to include mobilized within its ranks to replenish losses - probably the brigade's problems drastically reduced the flow of volunteers (benefitting others). A case in point is the 3rd Assault Brigade. A few weeks ago it was withdrawn from the frontline to rest, to train recruits and to become the largest brigade in the UAF: recently two newly formed rifle battalions were added to its structure, which has grown to seven maneuver battalions, counting the tank one. This is possible because the brigade still has a significant flow of volunteers (at the expense of others), due to the fact that it's perceived as successful, competent and caring toward its soldiers. And this is good.\n\nThere is another issue, however. Beyond the demographic aspect and the individual willingness to fight, today's voluntary enlistment of young men is damaged by the failure of the maximalist goals of the counteroffensive and the growing perception of it as a positional, static and attritional war. It's much more \"romantic\" for a 20-year-old to see himself on top of a Bradley chasing the Russians after breaking through their lines than in the trenches. \n\nBut my point is that it's good for Ukrainians (more so since in the short-medium term they will have to focus on defense) to have a \"cultural\" shift regarding this aspect, and the UAF needs to be a protagonist in enhancing that. Being part of a mechanized assault against Russian lines is actually much more dangerous at individual level, on average, than defending a trench or a position. Units that break through are supposed to take very heavy casualties in a short time, but that's not the case for those defending a position, except fuck-ups or being under enemy's main effort. I know about Ukrainian soldiers who have been defending sectors (where the Russian main effort was not concentrated) for over a year with very little rest, and despite there have obviously been deaths and serious injuries in their unit, most are alive and doing relatively well. Whereas you cannot storm enemy lines for a year and stay alive without being maimed. \n\nThere were interviews with young Ukrainians who were thinking of enlisting but were afraid at the idea of storming Russian fortified lines. So a strategy by the UAF to attract young people, and more recruits in general (especially the ones that are scared the most about fighting), beyond expanding mobilization, could be to improve people's perception about trench warfare, while other units should be fully trained to carry out competent mechanized attacks when an opportunity will arise. And here the UAF has to help with better, deeper, more protected trenches, as well as improving the perception that recruits are not just \"meat\".",

Whereas you cannot storm enemy lines for a year and stay alive without being maimed. </p>\n\n<p>There were interviews with young Ukrainians who were thinking of enlisting but were afraid at the idea of storming Russian fortified lines. So a strategy by the UAF to attract young people, and more recruits in general (especially the ones that are scared the most about fighting), beyond expanding mobilization, could be to improve people&#39;s perception about trench warfare, while other units should be fully trained to carry out competent mechanized attacks when an opportunity will arise. And here the UAF has to help with better, deeper, more protected trenches, as well as improving the perception that recruits are not just &quot;meat&quot;.</p>\n</div>",
