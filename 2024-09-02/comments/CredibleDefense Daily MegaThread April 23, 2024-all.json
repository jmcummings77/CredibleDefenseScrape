The warhead design is shared with Harpoons actually, so both variants are also effective against ships (assuming the ship is stationary, but that has been the case for all the aerial drone or cruise missile strikes against BSF ships anyway, which have exclusively targeted vessels at anchorage).\n\nM48s and M57s should also be effective against bridges in many cases, potentially including the Kerch Bridge, but there are existing challenges that have prevented Ukraine from using roughly comparable weapons which they already have in their arsenal such as StormShadow to accomplish that task. I'm not 100% certain about the mechanics here, so if someone knows better please feel free to correct me, but IIRC the M57 airburst fuze may be required to hit the Kerch Bridge, because the contact fuze variant would just blow a hole straight through the bridge deck possibly (maybe probably) without striking any of the structurally critical components because its CEP of ~10m isn't good enough to ensure a direct strike on a pylon or the steel arches over the shipping channel that would inflict critical damage on the structure.\n\nWhich is one of the main reasons there has been so much effort to get Germany to donate Taurus missiles. Taurus has the ability to optically target specific structures on the bridge. I'm also not 100% sure about this, but I believe the latest M57E1 variants have sufficiently small CEP to overcome the issue, so if the US donates even one or two of those in addition to the older, nearly expired variants, it could be potentially game changing for Ukraine's ability to choke off Russia's Crimean GLOCs.",

            "body": "> \n> \n> **We are meeting outside the army base. Are political discussions between soldiers problematic?**\n> The military leadership does not censor the opinions of the rank and file. However, I know from personal experience that when subordinates talk to the media, especially on political topics, it can make junior officers nervous. It has happened to me that a commander was worried that he would get a slap on the wrist for my interview, even though realistically there was no such threat.\n> In any case, I try to avoid unnecessary discussions. I don\u2019t loudly proclaim my political views or the fact that I\u2019m a historian, to save my energy. Otherwise, immediately someone wants me to talk about Kyivan Rus\u2019 or some provocative questions come up. If I see that there might be a possible collaboration in activism with some person in the future, then I\u2019ll start talking more openly to them.\n> \n> **How challenging is it to work with people who have different views?**\n> Opinions don\u2019t bother me in this context. There are all kinds of people here, but you rarely get to discuss broader political issues. But on issues that directly affect our lives and military service, such as senior leadership, we find common ground quite easily.\n> A much bigger problem in the military is the human factor. Some officers give stupid orders that get people killed unnecessarily. Any soldier who has served at least six months can tell you more than one such story.\n> As for the rank and file, in the first few months of the invasion they all pulled themselves together, but now, after two years, fatigue has set in. In the West, many expect that with fatigue, our will to fight will gradually wane. However, just because we are tired does not mean that it is not important for us to continue to resist.\n> But as I said, there are all kinds of people here. Some, despite the actions of the officers, understand that we need to keep working and keep pushing. And others... I once served with a soldier from another company and we spent four days in a collapsing trench. I started fixing it, and the soldier says, \u201cstop fucking about. Let the commander come and fix the trench himself.\u201d\n> Despite a shared determination to continue resisting Russian aggression, everybody asks themselves: \u201cWhy should I be the one to make the sacrifice?\u201d If the leadership has miscalculated on something, why should ordinary soldiers pay for it with their lives? And that includes civilians, whose willingness to enlist is declining. Even some of my friends who tried to enlist in 2022 and didn\u2019t get drafted are now trying to escape mobilization. It\u2019s not so much about fear as it is about certain nonsensical practices that are common in the military: everyone knows about them. They could have changed them a long time ago, but with a few exceptions in a few separate units, they didn\u2019t.\n> \n> **In 2022, you decided to join the army despite not having experience of fighting after 2014. Do these two stages of the war differ for you?**\n> In 2014, it was a war for territory. Some people really wanted to join Russia, even though they were a minority. Quite a significant number of people with pro-Russian views wanted to stay in Ukraine, but they wanted federalisation [Ed: more autonomy for Donetsk and Luhansk]. Of course, what percentage of the Donbas population held which view could be debated at length, and of course what the people living there thought has changed over time.\n> On the eve of the Russian troop intervention in 2022, a survey in the Donbas showed that welfare was more important to most people than which state they would live in - Ukraine or Russia. This is true for people living on both sides of the frontline. Of course, the opinion gap between the two parts of the Donbas has widened over the years. These are people who have become accustomed to a dual identity, so to speak. When they go to Lviv, people call them Muscovites, and when they are in Moscow, people call them Khokhols [Ed. Russian pejorative term for Ukrainians].\n> In 2014, a Russian, Igor Girkin [Also known as Igor Ivanovich Strelkov - Ed.], started the war (as the military commander of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, author\u2019s note), and later that year Russian troops invaded. But certainly, a lot of locals, for various reasons, decided to join the fight against the Ukrainian army.\n> At that time the war had a completely different effect on me. It killed any nationalism in me. But in 2022 we faced an open invasion, including areas like Kyiv, where nobody welcomed the Russian army. An invasion of the south, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, where most people want to return to Ukraine. In that sense, it\u2019s a different kind of war now. It\u2019s all much simpler.\n> \n> **Do you feel the influence of this \u201cdouble identity\u201d directly among your fellow combatants?**\n> Opinions differ everywhere, even here in the squad. For example, my current company commander apparently supported Anti-Maidan in the spring of 2014. I have a strained relationship with him, so I infer more from how he argues in conversations with other officers. According to him, the people in eastern Ukraine didn\u2019t like Maidan, so they demanded federalization, but the government was unwilling to agree to negotiations. However, since Girkin\u2019s group (separatists backed by Russian soldiers, author\u2019s note) seized the town of Slovyansk in 2014, he says it has been a Russian intelligence operation. He also dislikes language activists who want us all to switch to Ukrainian. Most of my unit is from the eastern regions and from what I hear they do not like nationalists. Some of my acquaintances also served in units with members of the former riot police Berkut, who defended the Yanukovych regime during the Maidan\u00f4 they havn\u2019t changed their views on the Maidan. Nevertheless, they are defending Ukraine against Russian aggression.\n> \n> \n> **In the Czech left-wing milieu, solidarity with civilians and refugees is strong, but there is little sympathy for armed resistance, or understanding why Ukrainians voluntary join the army. There are also demands to stop the supply of weapons. What do you think about all this?**\n> When you feel the invasion first hand, it changes you. As one of our editors said, it is much easier to prioritise at such critical moments. There are a lot of things that are important to you in everyday life. But when your own life is at stake, that becomes the main thing and everything else is secondary. It clears the mind a little.\n> In the first days of the invasion, I understood that the future of the left movement in Ukraine depended on whether we actively participate in the war or not. We are all largely judged by our actions at such critical moments. We - the left - are already not very influential in this country and if we had not gone to fight, everything would have fallen apart. The left would have ceased to exist as any kind of entity in Ukraine. For some reasons, I was and still am one of the most visible representatives of the left movement now serving in the armed forces. And so, I have a responsibility not only for myself but for others. It was also easier for me, I am not married, I don\u2019t even have children.\n> I don\u2019t like to answer journalist questions about why I decided to join the army. To put it mildly, I wasn\u2019t sure if I would make a good soldier. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I didn\u2019t prepare for it. I always thought I\u2019d be more useful in other ways, like writing articles. Honestly, I\u2019m still not much of a soldier (laughs). But I\u2019m gradually learning and then we\u2019ll see. I still have at least a whole year ahead of me.\n> \n> **You mentioned in one interview that it is not certain what will happen to the pro-Russian population of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea once these territories are liberated. What will be the relationship with this part of society? What will happen?**\n> We already have liberated areas, that is, we have a practice that we can analyse. For example, a friend of mine, a journalist and former left-wing activist who fled Crimea in 2014 to Ukraine, is now dealing with issues of collaboration in Lyman. People there are often tried unjustly. There are, of course, cases of those who actively participated in the repression, and they certainly need to be condemned. However, there are also cases where Ukraine is clearly unjustly judging, for example, an electrician from the technical services who maintained the living conditions of ordinary people in Lyman during the occupation.\n> There is a large grey area where it is not so clear-cut. The term \u2018rule of law\u2019 does not quite apply to Ukraine, given how many problems there are with the judiciary here. Despite all this, the level of repression and respect for human rights in the Russian-occupied territories and in the rest of Ukraine are incomparable.\n> The narrative in the Ukrainian mainstream about the eastern regions is also somewhat schizophrenic when it comes to the local population. On the one hand, people see them as \u201cours\u201d, on the other hand, they see them all as \u201cseparatists\u201d. There is no consistent narrative about what happened there in 2014. Moreover, if you go beyond a certain accepted discourse, when describing those events, you are considered a separatist. So, in that respect, I really don\u2019t like the way this is all working out in Ukraine.\n> \n>",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>We are meeting outside the army base. Are political discussions between soldiers problematic?</strong>\nThe military leadership does not censor the opinions of the rank and file. However, I know from personal experience that when subordinates talk to the media, especially on political topics, it can make junior officers nervous. It has happened to me that a commander was worried that he would get a slap on the wrist for my interview, even though realistically there was no such threat.\nIn any case, I try to avoid unnecessary discussions. I don\u2019t loudly proclaim my political views or the fact that I\u2019m a historian, to save my energy. Otherwise, immediately someone wants me to talk about Kyivan Rus\u2019 or some provocative questions come up. If I see that there might be a possible collaboration in activism with some person in the future, then I\u2019ll start talking more openly to them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How challenging is it to work with people who have different views?</strong>\nOpinions don\u2019t bother me in this context. There are all kinds of people here, but you rarely get to discuss broader political issues. But on issues that directly affect our lives and military service, such as senior leadership, we find common ground quite easily.\nA much bigger problem in the military is the human factor. Some officers give stupid orders that get people killed unnecessarily. Any soldier who has served at least six months can tell you more than one such story.\nAs for the rank and file, in the first few months of the invasion they all pulled themselves together, but now, after two years, fatigue has set in. In the West, many expect that with fatigue, our will to fight will gradually wane. However, just because we are tired does not mean that it is not important for us to continue to resist.\nBut as I said, there are all kinds of people here. Some, despite the actions of the officers, understand that we need to keep working and keep pushing. And others... I once served with a soldier from another company and we spent four days in a collapsing trench. I started fixing it, and the soldier says, \u201cstop fucking about. Let the commander come and fix the trench himself.\u201d\nDespite a shared determination to continue resisting Russian aggression, everybody asks themselves: \u201cWhy should I be the one to make the sacrifice?\u201d If the leadership has miscalculated on something, why should ordinary soldiers pay for it with their lives? And that includes civilians, whose willingness to enlist is declining. Even some of my friends who tried to enlist in 2022 and didn\u2019t get drafted are now trying to escape mobilization. It\u2019s not so much about fear as it is about certain nonsensical practices that are common in the military: everyone knows about them. They could have changed them a long time ago, but with a few exceptions in a few separate units, they didn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In 2022, you decided to join the army despite not having experience of fighting after 2014. Do these two stages of the war differ for you?</strong>\nIn 2014, it was a war for territory. Some people really wanted to join Russia, even though they were a minority. Quite a significant number of people with pro-Russian views wanted to stay in Ukraine, but they wanted federalisation [Ed: more autonomy for Donetsk and Luhansk]. Of course, what percentage of the Donbas population held which view could be debated at length, and of course what the people living there thought has changed over time.\nOn the eve of the Russian troop intervention in 2022, a survey in the Donbas showed that welfare was more important to most people than which state they would live in - Ukraine or Russia. This is true for people living on both sides of the frontline. Of course, the opinion gap between the two parts of the Donbas has widened over the years. These are people who have become accustomed to a dual identity, so to speak. When they go to Lviv, people call them Muscovites, and when they are in Moscow, people call them Khokhols [Ed. Russian pejorative term for Ukrainians].\nIn 2014, a Russian, Igor Girkin [Also known as Igor Ivanovich Strelkov - Ed.], started the war (as the military commander of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, author\u2019s note), and later that year Russian troops invaded. But certainly, a lot of locals, for various reasons, decided to join the fight against the Ukrainian army.\nAt that time the war had a completely different effect on me. It killed any nationalism in me. But in 2022 we faced an open invasion, including areas like Kyiv, where nobody welcomed the Russian army. An invasion of the south, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, where most people want to return to Ukraine. In that sense, it\u2019s a different kind of war now. It\u2019s all much simpler.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you feel the influence of this \u201cdouble identity\u201d directly among your fellow combatants?</strong>\nOpinions differ everywhere, even here in the squad. For example, my current company commander apparently supported Anti-Maidan in the spring of 2014. I have a strained relationship with him, so I infer more from how he argues in conversations with other officers. According to him, the people in eastern Ukraine didn\u2019t like Maidan, so they demanded federalization, but the government was unwilling to agree to negotiations. However, since Girkin\u2019s group (separatists backed by Russian soldiers, author\u2019s note) seized the town of Slovyansk in 2014, he says it has been a Russian intelligence operation. He also dislikes language activists who want us all to switch to Ukrainian. Most of my unit is from the eastern regions and from what I hear they do not like nationalists. Some of my acquaintances also served in units with members of the former riot police Berkut, who defended the Yanukovych regime during the Maidan\u00f4 they havn\u2019t changed their views on the Maidan. Nevertheless, they are defending Ukraine against Russian aggression.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In the Czech left-wing milieu, solidarity with civilians and refugees is strong, but there is little sympathy for armed resistance, or understanding why Ukrainians voluntary join the army. There are also demands to stop the supply of weapons. What do you think about all this?</strong>\nWhen you feel the invasion first hand, it changes you. As one of our editors said, it is much easier to prioritise at such critical moments. There are a lot of things that are important to you in everyday life. But when your own life is at stake, that becomes the main thing and everything else is secondary. It clears the mind a little.\nIn the first days of the invasion, I understood that the future of the left movement in Ukraine depended on whether we actively participate in the war or not. We are all largely judged by our actions at such critical moments. We - the left - are already not very influential in this country and if we had not gone to fight, everything would have fallen apart. The left would have ceased to exist as any kind of entity in Ukraine. For some reasons, I was and still am one of the most visible representatives of the left movement now serving in the armed forces. And so, I have a responsibility not only for myself but for others. It was also easier for me, I am not married, I don\u2019t even have children.\nI don\u2019t like to answer journalist questions about why I decided to join the army. To put it mildly, I wasn\u2019t sure if I would make a good soldier. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I didn\u2019t prepare for it. I always thought I\u2019d be more useful in other ways, like writing articles. Honestly, I\u2019m still not much of a soldier (laughs). But I\u2019m gradually learning and then we\u2019ll see. I still have at least a whole year ahead of me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You mentioned in one interview that it is not certain what will happen to the pro-Russian population of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea once these territories are liberated. What will be the relationship with this part of society? What will happen?</strong>\nWe already have liberated areas, that is, we have a practice that we can analyse. For example, a friend of mine, a journalist and former left-wing activist who fled Crimea in 2014 to Ukraine, is now dealing with issues of collaboration in Lyman. People there are often tried unjustly. There are, of course, cases of those who actively participated in the repression, and they certainly need to be condemned. However, there are also cases where Ukraine is clearly unjustly judging, for example, an electrician from the technical services who maintained the living conditions of ordinary people in Lyman during the occupation.\nThere is a large grey area where it is not so clear-cut. The term \u2018rule of law\u2019 does not quite apply to Ukraine, given how many problems there are with the judiciary here. Despite all this, the level of repression and respect for human rights in the Russian-occupied territories and in the rest of Ukraine are incomparable.\nThe narrative in the Ukrainian mainstream about the eastern regions is also somewhat schizophrenic when it comes to the local population. On the one hand, people see them as \u201cours\u201d, on the other hand, they see them all as \u201cseparatists\u201d. There is no consistent narrative about what happened there in 2014. Moreover, if you go beyond a certain accepted discourse, when describing those events, you are considered a separatist. So, in that respect, I really don\u2019t like the way this is all working out in Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

However, the general consensus has moved towards stronger nationalism. And Zelenskyy has moved in that direction as well. One can also find politicians who are more open [than Zelenskyy \u2013 Ed.] towards the Russian-speaking population, but they have no chance of winning a presidential election. It also seems to me that some on the Western left don\u2019t understand that an open stance on language issues does not mean a generally progressive agenda.

I was an activist before the Maidan. A few months earlier, we had tried to organize a protest about education. We handed out leaflets on campus, but people were very passive. But as soon as Maidan started, the same people who a few months back were saying that there was no point to protest, or something similarly cynical, all of a sudden, they got passionate about the cause and made such revolutionary speeches that I just stared at them (Laughter). I didn\u2019t realise back then that people change suddenly in the case of big uprisings.\n> Maidan is a story about resistance to the state and the repressive apparatus, and about solidarity.

I thought, in my exaggerated way, that the people of the West would wake up. Now I see how naive I was and how I underestimated the scale of the problem.

                    "body": "> **What advice would you give to the Western left?**\n> A significant part of the left has taken an absolutely inadequate position. Those who devote their time to arguing in support of Ukraine are, after all, doing the right thing. The left is in crisis everywhere. It\u2019s just that in some places it\u2019s completely screwed up, like here, and in some places, like in the West, things are not as bad. If I were to give some general advice, I would recommend paying less attention to which abstract position is correct, and focusing more on practical action to help us climb out of the hole we are in.\n> Even in our own organisation [Social Movement \u2013 Ed.] until 2022, we took different positions on the war in the Donbas. Sometimes it was difficult to reconcile these sensibilities. In order not to escalate the situation, we often censored ourselves. One of my arguments is, let\u2019s not argue about things that we cannot influence. Left-wingers are often condescending, they consider themselves to be the only reasonable and critical ones. Yet, from the inside, you can see how much of this is learned boilerplate. For example, how some leftists articulate their position and strategy in debates. Instead of analysing specific conditions, they often just repeat examples taken from a completely different context and time, which do not fit the situation at all. We need to move away from these templates. Marxism is not dogma, but for some reason too many Marxists in practice reduce Marxism to a mere repetition of established dogmas. \u201cNo war except class war\u201d and so on.\n> One telling situation occurred when the German delegation of Die Linke from the Bundestag arrived last spring. Until then, their position on the supply of arms had been completely negative. When they left, the chairman of the group said that they had reconsidered some of their positions after their experience in Kyiv. For example, that the Ukrainians clearly need missile defence. The same missile defence that they had refused to supply until then, was actually protecting them in Kyiv! And so, more than a year after the invasion, they realised how necessary it was. It took them a long time to come to this understanding, and there is still a lot they need to understand (laughter). But this is at least the basic minimum.\n> \n\n> \n> **Is there anything you would like to say to the Czech left, for example in relation to the extreme pacifism you mentioned?**\n> The Czech left has the historical experience of the suppression of the Prague Spring, so I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t find more understanding for our defiance. Perhaps it is because of an over-dependence on Western leftist theory. Frankly, it was exactly the same in our country and in some aspects it is still the same today. After 1989 the left in Ukraine was very depressing, and we looked all the more to Western authors. At Commons review, we certainly do translations. But at a certain level we understand and feels that we need a kind of decolonization of ourselves. February 24, 2022, the day of the Russian invasion, also became a moment of intellectual emancipation for us. It is necessary to be more critical of what Western authors write.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to the Western left?</strong>\nA significant part of the left has taken an absolutely inadequate position. Those who devote their time to arguing in support of Ukraine are, after all, doing the right thing. The left is in crisis everywhere. It\u2019s just that in some places it\u2019s completely screwed up, like here, and in some places, like in the West, things are not as bad. If I were to give some general advice, I would recommend paying less attention to which abstract position is correct, and focusing more on practical action to help us climb out of the hole we are in.\nEven in our own organisation [Social Movement \u2013 Ed.] until 2022, we took different positions on the war in the Donbas. Sometimes it was difficult to reconcile these sensibilities. In order not to escalate the situation, we often censored ourselves. One of my arguments is, let\u2019s not argue about things that we cannot influence. Left-wingers are often condescending, they consider themselves to be the only reasonable and critical ones. Yet, from the inside, you can see how much of this is learned boilerplate. For example, how some leftists articulate their position and strategy in debates. Instead of analysing specific conditions, they often just repeat examples taken from a completely different context and time, which do not fit the situation at all. We need to move away from these templates. Marxism is not dogma, but for some reason too many Marxists in practice reduce Marxism to a mere repetition of established dogmas. \u201cNo war except class war\u201d and so on.\nOne telling situation occurred when the German delegation of Die Linke from the Bundestag arrived last spring. Until then, their position on the supply of arms had been completely negative. When they left, the chairman of the group said that they had reconsidered some of their positions after their experience in Kyiv. For example, that the Ukrainians clearly need missile defence. The same missile defence that they had refused to supply until then, was actually protecting them in Kyiv! And so, more than a year after the invasion, they realised how necessary it was. It took them a long time to come to this understanding, and there is still a lot they need to understand (laughter). But this is at least the basic minimum.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything you would like to say to the Czech left, for example in relation to the extreme pacifism you mentioned?</strong>\nThe Czech left has the historical experience of the suppression of the Prague Spring, so I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t find more understanding for our defiance. Perhaps it is because of an over-dependence on Western leftist theory. Frankly, it was exactly the same in our country and in some aspects it is still the same today. After 1989 the left in Ukraine was very depressing, and we looked all the more to Western authors. At Commons review, we certainly do translations. But at a certain level we understand and feels that we need a kind of decolonization of ourselves. February 24, 2022, the day of the Russian invasion, also became a moment of intellectual emancipation for us. It is necessary to be more critical of what Western authors write. We have learned a lot from them, and openly admit it, but we have a somewhat different context. We must not be afraid to look at it from a local perspective. And this includes developing a local analysis of the ideas of Western left-wing authors.\nIn the local leftist environment, we have also, to our detriment, many times just repeated the views of the Western left. The two scourges of contemporary left politics are historical reconstruction and the adoption of trends.

Oil production here is a lot more concentrated in a small region than it is in Russia, but it\u2019s similar enough. If you look at a satellite map you can see hundreds or thousands of pump jacks all around the Permian. I imagine oil production in Russia is a lot more like Wyoming, where it\u2019s more dispersed. I don\u2019t know if Russia has a really concentrated oil production region like the Permian basin.\n\nThe pump jacks would be stupid to attack because there are so many of them, and individually, they don\u2019t produce much. The oil goes from there to small tank batteries and then by truck to big terminals that store millions of gallons of oil in each tank. The only reasonable target in the oil production pipeline would be those terminals. There are a lot of them, but they\u2019re big and easy to hit. My company is big-ish and we have 12 terminals in the Permian. So I\u2019m going to throw out a wild guess and say there are 100 or so near my city, Midland, the center of oil production in West Texas (Odessa, our sister city, may disagree). \n\nTerminals are essentially big, round tanks. That\u2019s it. There aren\u2019t complicated. There are some pumps and mixers and level sensors. They could be rebuilt in a lot less time than a refinery.\n\nAll the refineries in Texas (as far as I know) are near Houston on the coast. There are a lot fewer of them -in the 10s range - and they are a lot more complicated. I don\u2019t know anything about refining except the basics. I know they\u2019re more complicated than natural gas plants. I worked at several natural gas plants and those are really big and complicated. Refineries have single pieces of equipment that are vital for the whole plant to run that the Ukrainians have been wisely targeting. They could be replaced here pretty easily, but with sanctions and the Russians\u2019 relative lack of engineering expertise, it\u2019s harder for them. A lot of our refineries are older and not as high-tech as the newer ones (from what I understand) because they\u2019re expensive to build and upgrade. If it was me, I wouldn\u2019t bother attacking terminals at all unless they were refined products terminals that directly supplied the front. I think that\u2019s what Ukraine has been doing, though.\n\nI\u2019m an environmental engineer so I know the basics of the oil field. I run spill drills, where we simulate spills and hypothetical worst-case tank failures and I maintain FRPs - facility response plans - written plans for operators to follow if there\u2019s an accident. A \u201creal\u201d engineer could probably tell you more.\n\nFun fact: Odessa, TX was named by Ukrainian immigrants who built the railroads out here, although we spell it wrong. The Permian basin, the area from West Texas to southeast New Mexico where oil production in the US is highest, is named after the Perm region of Russia.",

Third, taking out refineries has a minimal impact on global oil prices.  \n\nThere's no reason Ukraine can't also hit oil production within range, but the payoff isn't nearly as good and it risks angering allies who will not be helped by rising oil prices.

Third, taking out refineries has a minimal impact on global oil prices.  </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no reason Ukraine can&#39;t also hit oil production within range, but the payoff isn&#39;t nearly as good and it risks angering allies who will not be helped by rising oil prices.  The only new requirement is that they will likely need more hits to disable the site and it wouldn&#39;t be down for nearly as long.</p>\n</div>",

On April 10th Daleep Singh, America\u2019s deputy national security adviser for international economics, declared that the <strong>Biden administration now wanted to make use of interest income on frozen Russian assets in order to \u201cmaximise the impact of these revenues, both current and future, for the benefit of Ukraine today\u201d. Six days later David Cameron, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, announced his support, too: \u201cThere is an emerging consensus that the interest on those assets can be used.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>The approach is an elegant one. Income earned on Russia\u2019s foreign holdings can be seized in a manner that is both legal and practical. Many of the country\u2019s bonds have already matured. Cash from redemption of bonds is held by the depository in which it currently sits until it is withdrawn, paying no interest to the owner as per the depository\u2019s usual terms and conditions. Any interest earned thus belongs to the depository\u2014unless, that is, the state decides to tax it at a rate close to 100%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/FOmyT#selection-1099.0-1099.508\">https://archive.ph/FOmyT#selection-1099.0-1099.508</a></p>\n</div>",

When Popasna was seized by the Russians in the first half of May '22, the Ukrainian 24th Mechanized Brigade was in tatters, after putting up a tenacious and strenuous resistance. The brigade's cooks and the musical band also had to fight. \n\nThe area was the main effort of PMC Wagner, supported by elements of numerous motor rifle, air assault and naval infantry units as well as a lot of artillery brigades. When the Russians, after the middle of the month, managed to break through to the north and especially to the north-west, there were very few Ukrainian troops to oppose them, and with very serious shell availability issues - with the tanks being forced into indirect fire roles to replace artillery, which prompted to a shortage of tank ammos too. It was not until late May that the \"firefighters\" of the 80th Air Assault Brigade managed to stop the 76th VDV Division and elements of the 90th Tank Division, when the Russians already had taken the Bakhmut-Lysychansk Highway under direct fire control. And other elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade had to take the fight to make up for the loss of ground around Toshkivka, to delay the closing of the Zolote/Hirske pocket!\n\nAnother case was Svitlodarsk, which was being successfully defended by the 30th Mechanized Brigade. Then it was forced to send one of its battalions to Bilohorivka (where the Russians attempted the well-known mechanized crossing over the Siversky Donets) and another one to the north of Popasna. PMC Wagner eventually took the town relatively easily, as there were physically very few people left to defend it. IIRC, a potentially successful counterattack by the 93rd Mechanized Brigade in the Izyum sector was cancelled for a lack of fresh battalions! Although it's worth noting that some of the problems at that time were self-inflicted: numerous brigades were concentrated on defending the wrong side of the Siversky Donets, both in the Severodonetsk/Rubizhne and the Lyman/Sviatohirsk areas. And simultaneously several recently activated reserve brigades were engaged in mostly unsuccessful counterattacks along the Inhulets River, between the Mykolaiv and Kherson Oblasts. Only the exhaustion of the Russians, the transfer of the Eastern Military District to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, the arrival of aid from partner and the reconstitution of the existing brigades, along with the creation of new ones and the commitment of TDF brigades outside their own oblast, allowed the Ukrainians to take a breath and the Russian advances to be halted.\n\nAlthough as far as Ocheretyne is concerned, I wonder why the 3rd Assault Brigade was not employed to stop the Russians, just like when they were sent to Krasnohorivka in late February to stop the Russian advance in that town. The majority of the 3rd Assault Brigade was withdrawn at the end of February, when the 61st Mechanized Brigade was committed in Lastochkyne/Orlivka, and in late March the section of the front previously under their responsibility (the area around Semenivka) was handed over to the 68th Jager Brigade. Almost all the maneuver units of the 3rd Assault Brigade, except minor elements, are in the rear at the moment being.",
