So you have the dam, and then to the east you had a slipway that allows water to flow if the resevoir overfills and the dam can't release enough water. Over that slipway was a bridge, which connected the dam to the east side of Kherson Oblast. Combined this bridge and the dam itself formed a continuous crossing across the Dnipr.\n\nNow the Ukrainians knocked out the bridge over the slipway with HIMARs, but didn't hit the damn because they don't want to flood everything down stream. The Russian's have filled in the entire overlow slipway with gravel and other material to form a physical structure vehicles can drive over. This is basically invulnerable to HIMAR strikes as the Russian's will just fill any new holes with more gravel or dirt.\n\nIn essence they have one physical connection bridging the Dnipr that they can drive trucks and maybe tanks across. Every other crossing is out of service, but the connection at the dam at Nova Kakhovka is still working. If Ukraine can get into artillery range of it, then they can keep it under fire with cheap artillery shells. At the moment 100,000 dollar Himars are too expensive and limited in number to keep the crossing under continuous fire.",

The Russian&#39;s have filled in the entire overlow slipway with gravel and other material to form a physical structure vehicles can drive over. This is basically invulnerable to HIMAR strikes as the Russian&#39;s will just fill any new holes with more gravel or dirt.</p>\n\n<p>In essence they have one physical connection bridging the Dnipr that they can drive trucks and maybe tanks across. Every other crossing is out of service, but the connection at the dam at Nova Kakhovka is still working. If Ukraine can get into artillery range of it, then they can keep it under fire with cheap artillery shells. At the moment 100,000 dollar Himars are too expensive and limited in number to keep the crossing under continuous fire.</p>\n</div>",

Traditionally a forward observer(FO) would call for fire mission and state the intended target, the battery would fire a single spotting round, and the FO would call for a adjust fire to correct until the spotting round was hitting the mark. With the mark found the FO would call for \"Fire For Effect\", and the battery would response by firing however many full salvos as determined by the type of target. If the target wasn't destroyed then the FO would call for further rounds.\n\nNow as the battery fires full salvos it has to reload each time creating a delay. That delay gives infantry time to take cover, or even just to kiss the Earth. With a battery firing multiple rounds that impact simultaneously there isn't any chance to take cover. The dispersion of the rounds effectively saturates the target area, with a greater chance of higher causalities. Modern artillery systems are more accurate on the first round, but that only makes MRSI more effective. There is some use for counter-battery as well, but firing in MRSI reduces maximum range.

Eg suppose your doctrine calls for an entire 4-gun battery to shoot at a target for maximum effect.

        "body": "New CITeam report out. Refer the original for links and translation errors. \n\nhttps://notes.citeam.org/ru-dispatch-oct-17-18\n\n\u2026\n\nSummary for October 17-18 (until 13:00)\n\nThe situation on the front line\n\n>There are reports that Russian forces tried unsuccessfully to attack Bakhmut, Soledar, Ivano-Daryevka and Torskoye.\n\n>The 93rd brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine published a video of the T-90M tank shot down near Bakhmut. We don't know if this tank belonged to the 3rd Army Corps or not.\n\n>There was also news that Russian tankers are supporting the offensive of Wagner's group near Bakhmut.\n\n>The calm continues on the Kherson front. Some pro-Russian telegram channels from those who wrote about the critical situation and a possible attack by a large Ukrainian group in the direction of Borislav admitted that the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were reconnaissance. If it were a full-fledged offensive, then, reflecting it, Russian forces could publish evidence of Ukrainian losses (in technology and manpower).\n\n>As a result of the shelling of Sumy region, 3 people were killed and 9 wounded.\n\n>One of the temporary bridges over the lock of the Kakhovskaya HPP has either been destroyed or removed.\n\n>At the same time, apparently, a barge bridge running parallel to Antonovsky has been completed.\n\nBarrage ordnance strikes on Ukraine\n\n>Yan Matveev, who often speaks on the YouTube channel \"Popular Politics\" as a military expert, analyzed the hits of Russian kamikaze drones on residential buildings in Kiev. He concluded that they were caused by the inaccuracy of the drones themselves, not by the work of air defense. At the same time, it is quite possible to shoot down such a drone with a machine gun (but only professionals should do it).\n\n>Maxim Litavrin from \"Mediazona\" analyzed the publication of the pro-Russian telegram channel \"War with fakes\", where they write that a Ukrainian air defense rocket allegedly flew through the residential building.

The Kiev authorities report two dead and one wounded.\n\n>Western experts, commenting on the possible supply of Iranian missiles to Russia, note that these missiles have already been tested in various military conflicts, they are quite accurate and effective.

Secondary detonation refutes this statement, fuel tanks do not explode like that. Some experts agree that ammunition from the GSh-30-1 gun, which is installed on such fighters, could have detonated. It is said that charging such a cannon tape is very long and tedious, so it could be left charged before the training flight. Komsomolskaya Pravda correspondent Alexander Kots also said that they had detonated shells to the gun that the Su-34 has.\n\n>Our team admits that this may be true, but also does not exclude the version of combat flight with full ammunition (from Yeysk to fly relatively close to the front line).\n\n>The Su-34 is not in service with the Russian Navy, and its use for training naval aviation pilots has not previously been reported in open sources.

The 859th Naval Aviation Combat and Retraining Center is based at this airfield.

We don&#39;t know if this tank belonged to the 3rd Army Corps or not.</p>\n\n<p>There was also news that Russian tankers are supporting the offensive of Wagner&#39;s group near Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>The calm continues on the Kherson front. Some pro-Russian telegram channels from those who wrote about the critical situation and a possible attack by a large Ukrainian group in the direction of Borislav admitted that the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were reconnaissance. If it were a full-fledged offensive, then, reflecting it, Russian forces could publish evidence of Ukrainian losses (in technology and manpower).</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the shelling of Sumy region, 3 people were killed and 9 wounded.</p>\n\n<p>One of the temporary bridges over the lock of the Kakhovskaya HPP has either been destroyed or removed.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, apparently, a barge bridge running parallel to Antonovsky has been completed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Barrage ordnance strikes on Ukraine</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yan Matveev, who often speaks on the YouTube channel &quot;Popular Politics&quot; as a military expert, analyzed the hits of Russian kamikaze drones on residential buildings in Kiev. He concluded that they were caused by the inaccuracy of the drones themselves, not by the work of air defense. At the same time, it is quite possible to shoot down such a drone with a machine gun (but only professionals should do it).</p>\n\n<p>Maxim Litavrin from &quot;Mediazona&quot; analyzed the publication of the pro-Russian telegram channel &quot;War with fakes&quot;, where they write that a Ukrainian air defense rocket allegedly flew through the residential building. He also concluded that UAVs that crashed into residential buildings were not affected by either MANPADS or air defense missiles (one of these incidents was caught in the video, where it is clear that nothing changed the trajectory of the drone).</p>\n\n<p>It became known that as a result of hitting a kamikaze drone on a residential building in Kiev on October 17, at least 5 people died under the rubble, including a pregnant woman.</p>\n\n<p>Today, October 18, strikes with Shahed-136 barrage ammunition on the territory of Ukraine continue.

They are easier to manufacture(with off-the-shelf components) than other long-range precision weapons, also drones seem to be the most effective surveillance tools for both sides currently, so it makes sense to arm the drones themselves to shorten the kill chain.\r  \n\r  \nI hope the West helps Ukraine(with guidance, technology transfer, and component supply) to build a serious UCAV industry. It looks like the war is going to continue for quite some time, so it's important to think long-term. The next iteration should be drones that can be sent to some general area where they will identify and attack targets autonomously(like the Israeli Harpy, though it only attacks radars AFAIK). Sensor-fused munitions like BONUS/SMARt-155 have been able to identify targets for decades, with current chips it should be dramatically simpler and cheaper. This will make the drones safe from jamming(especially important for Ukraine considering the number of EW equipment that Russia has) and overcome the datalink range limitation(usually 40km or 100km with a bigger antenna). The software sector is quite developed in Ukraine, I'm sure they can implement autonomous targeting if enough resources are dedicated to it.",
