        "body": "Mandatory update on the matter of one-time payments upon signing contracts in Russia. Last time (two days ago) we had seen that the record one-time bonus was 2,245 million Rubles. Today Putin approved the doubling of the amount offered as a one-time bonus by the MoD - from 195 to 400 thousand Rubles, calling on all federal subjects to give at least as much with their own funds (the poorest regions are indeed still under that figure). This \u201cadvice\u201d isn't needed for the richest federal subjects: city of Moscow, Moscow Oblast, city of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast are all at \u2265 2 million Rubles.\n\nScrolling VK for a while today, at first I found a 2,3 million bonus in a contract offer. Then 2,4 million. Finally [2,495,000 - a new record high](https://i.imgur.com/vTxhocQ.jpeg)! Details [here](https://i.imgur.com/wv8iypW.png). That's an offer from the city of Moscow, the one that provides the best deals in the whole country (let's recall again, such contracts are signable by every Russian citizen, with reimbursement of transportation costs incurred in order to travel to the city where the contract must be signed). This offer is open to men aged 18 to 60 and is also signable by women (up to 45 years old) with medical qualifications, for service in medical battalions/companies of the military units. \n\nThe basic salary is 210 thousand Rubles (there is also a bonus of 8 thousand Rubles for each day of combat operations and one of 50 thousand Rubles for each kilometer of advance as part of an assault detachment); the city of Moscow will provide additional 50 thousand Rubles per month. Then there are the other privileges which I mentioned the other times, and recently new ones have been added. For example, for each child the volunteer has, he has a right to additional 18,7 thousand Rubles per month.\n\n***\n\nNow, a quick update regarding the mobilization in Ukraine. The news about the decidedly accelerated pace of mobilization has reached the Western press - the [NYT](https://archive.is/kYEFd) writes of \"up to 30,000\" mobilized men per month since May, according to three military experts. If you'll allow me a little self-gratification, this was in fact the number I had estimated back in June. Moreover, according to Ukrainians sources, the pace is not only 2/3 times higher than the winter period (as stated in the NYT article), but up to 6 times. \n\nWe don't know whether the very strong increase in bonuses in Russia is providing a boost to its amount of volunteers, but if, as also claimed by Kofman, during 2024 Russia has been recruiting less than 30,000 men per month, it's definitely possible that since May Ukraine has been recruiting at least as many men as Russia. Hopefully this good pace, which the Ukrainian authorities confirm they are very pleased about, will be maintained in the coming months.\n\nAs of July 16 (the deadline for that), 4,69 million Ukrainian citizens subject to military service [have updated](https://suspilne.media/792947-ponad-45-mlrd-vijskovozobovazanih-onovili-dani-vcasno-bilsist-cerez-rezerv/) their personal data (most of them in the \u201cReserv+\u201d app). This figure includes 65,000 who did so from abroad, a few hundred thousand women (those with medical/nursing degrees) and also men exempt from service under current rules. Using as a proxy the figures released in the [update](https://censor.net/ua/news/3496450/pislya_onovlennya_danyh_ye_ponad_milyion_potentsiyinyh_mobilizovanyh) of the end of June, around 48% of those who have uploaded data are mobilizable under the current rules - a very high number in absolute terms. At the moment Ukrainian authorities [have stated](https://censor.net/ua/news/3501660/chy_budut_elektronni_povistky_minoborony_vidpovilo) that there is no need nor legal grounds to introduce electronic summons via the \u201cReserv+\u201d app.\n\nZelensky [complained](https://uworld.news/news/zelenskyi-pro-mobilizatsiiu-viiskovi-kazhut-1011575.html) about the fact that there aren't enough training centers to train the high number of recruits. In the NYT article the issues in training are, rightly, emphasized. The training centers are trying to hire as many specialists and (veteran) trainers as possible, for which there is a very high demand. The average age of the mobilized remains 40, which should keep the current average age of the servicemen stable, accordingly. \n\nI think that actually the figure of 30,000 men per month concerns the number of new recruits in general: Ukrainian sources had stated that about 1/4 of the new recruits are volunteers. This should be confirmed by [new statements](https://news.liga.net/ua/politics/news/za-dva-misiatsi-pokaznyky-zaluchennia-dobrovoltsiv-u-zsu-zrosly-u-3-5-raza-henshtab), which report that the number of Ukrainians who are seeking to join the UAF by signing a contract has increased by \u201c3,5 times\u201d compared to the average of the period between late 2022 and spring 2024. There have been some new developments - for instance, under-25s can now sign a 1-year contract with discharge at the end of the term (assuming the mobilization age is not lowered by the next year, though). The success of the new Recruitment Centers (as well as platforms such as Lobby X) is also highlighted - these are being opened in Ukrainian cities, where the citizen interested in joining can choose role and brigade. \n\nThis process has been improved and made more efficient. A citizen interested in joining a brigade which is on the list of those that have the priority (i.e. the most renowned ones and those most in urgent need of replenishments) will conduct an interview with the representative of that brigade and receive (in case of admission) a letter of recommendation, after which he will go to the TRC in order to be formally enlisted, pass the medical examination and receive basic training in a Training Center. After that, he will go to his chosen brigade (where, considering that generally the best brigades are the ones chosen by those who volunteer, he will receive an additional training period). For those who want to join a brigade that is not on the priority list, there are some extra steps. Such brigade has to communicate which roles it needs to hire and why to the military management body, which will send the request to the General Staff. If the request is approved, the letter of recommendation can be delivered and then the volunteer can shows up to the TRC. \n\nHowever, the situation is very complicated with regards to labor shortages, particularly in Western Ukraine where, as we had seen the last time, there has been a large growth in vacancies compared to the pre-war month, because of companies relocating there from the East and the South. The law about the reform of the \"reservation\" system (for which an enterprise can make all or a part of its workers exempt from mobilization) is still under discussion. Defense and energy companies will be able to \"book\" 100% of their employees; other critical enterprises (trucking, agriculture, etc - so far more than 700 companies were identified) will be able to reserve up to 50%. In total, [1,2 million workers](https://biz.censor.net/news/3500349/skilky_lyudeyi_mojut_zabronyuvaty_vid_mobilizatsiyi) can be \"booked\" under the current regulations. Many companies are trying to increase the involvement of women in the labor market (including for roles such as bus driver, or even in quarries), hiring more under-25s, and luring retirees.\n\nOne of the proposals is the introduction of the \u201ceconomic reservation\", whereby an enterprise can make a worker exempt by paying to the state 20 thousand Hryvnias per month (as much as an average gross salary). Considering that only a portion of enterprises can afford to pay such amounts of money, there are talks about a [new proposal](https://dev.ua/news/ekonomichne-broniuvannia-nova-model), whereby businesses could offer labor, goods or services for free to the UAF for the value they would have to pay to the state in exchange for the reservation of their workers. At the moment, these proposals are still in the discussion stage and the debate is pretty heated.",

Chris Miller writes extensively about this in Putinomics.  The deal's been in place for decades now and so people rely on it, and have come to expect domestic gas to be very cheap.\n\nThis is all very inconvenient to both Gazprom and to the Putin regime right now.  The Russian state has a controlling interest in Gazprom and so the shareholders can't stop subsidizing domestic gas in order to turn the ship around, but at some point Gazprom will be insolvent if this continues.  I can't find any recent financial statements but I'm guessing they've been increasing their leverage to keep the lights on\\[1\\].  When external investors are unwilling to lend more money to Gazprom\\[2\\], the Russian state will have to inject cash into Gazprom or they will have to raise prices on domestic gas.  This is a real dilemma for the regime: They need the cash for the war effort and raising the price of gas would be unbelievably unpopular. \n\nThis is all exacerbated by the campaign against oil refineries and oil depots because it makes fuel substitution an even less attractive option (in the areas of the economy where that's even possible). \n\n  \n\\[1\\] The alternative is to issue shares, but that would be a cash drain that the largest investor, the Russian state, can't afford.  They could of course opt to not participate, but then they would lose control and that can't be allowed to happen.\n\n\\[2\\] This happens when their loan / asset ratio reaches some level deemed so risky, even at high interest rates, that nobody wants to lend them money.  You could argue that Gazprom is \"too big to fail\" and so there's reduced risk here, but I don't think that's true.  A large share of the owners of Gazprom are probably still foreigners and so it might be politically expedient so shed the debt by shafting the shareholders, letting the debt holders take a large haircut and reconstituting Gazprom in a wholly rigged process where the state gets to keep the majority control cheaply.",

This is a real dilemma for the regime: They need the cash for the war effort and raising the price of gas would be unbelievably unpopular. </p>\n\n<p>This is all exacerbated by the campaign against oil refineries and oil depots because it makes fuel substitution an even less attractive option (in the areas of the economy where that&#39;s even possible). </p>\n\n<p>[1] The alternative is to issue shares, but that would be a cash drain that the largest investor, the Russian state, can&#39;t afford.  They could of course opt to not participate, but then they would lose control and that can&#39;t be allowed to happen.</p>\n\n<p>[2] This happens when their loan / asset ratio reaches some level deemed so risky, even at high interest rates, that nobody wants to lend them money.  You could argue that Gazprom is &quot;too big to fail&quot; and so there&#39;s reduced risk here, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.  A large share of the owners of Gazprom are probably still foreigners and so it might be politically expedient so shed the debt by shafting the shareholders, letting the debt holders take a large haircut and reconstituting Gazprom in a wholly rigged process where the state gets to keep the majority control cheaply.</p>\n</div>",

Iranian militias have been actively operating in southern Syria, prompting frequent Israeli airstrikes. Maurizio Molinari writes that Russia has been gathering intelligence on the weapons used by Israel in Syria, which are similar to the Western arms supplied to Ukraine.

I think any basic analysis of Netanyahu's behaviour over the last few months should show that he & his cabinet have no interest in a deal that preserves Hamas.\n\n> Even if that means that there will be no deal to return the hostages, that seems to be a calculation made by Netanyahu - that a diplomatic resolution that returns the hostages is less preferable than risking the safety of the remaining hostages by refusing concessions to Hamas.\n\n> That's not to say that Netanyahu does not want to see the hostages freed, and what I am saying is merely my own interpretation of his actions, but that freeing the hostages at the cost of ending hostilities with Hamas still in power in Gaza is not a price he is willing to pay.\n> With no change to the status quo on the occupation on offer, the underlying conditions in Gaza are highly unlikely to change postbellum. Therefore the 2nd and 3rd aims of the declared war aims following October 7th seem to at the very least no longer be a priority for Netanyahu.\n\n> However, by assassinating Deif & Haniyeh, the first & probably most important war aim to Netanyahu in the wake of Oct 7th now seems credibly achievable to a certain extent. Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a \"victory\" over Hamas in Gaza.\n\n> Given Hamas' history I do not think liquidating the 3 most senior Hamas figures means the group has been \"destroyed\". It will have certainly experienced a military defeat, and its current military capabilities have been degraded & exhausted.\n\n> If Hamas can replace Yassin & Meshaal, it can also replace Haniyeh, Deif & Sinwar. However, if Israel does eventually capture or kill Sinwar too, it would be hard for even the fiercest of Netanyahu's Israeli opponents to deny that Israel has achieved a strategic victory of sorts.\n\n> Leaving aside an escalatory spiral with Iran & its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, Netanyahu would be able to claim a credible victory of sorts over Hamas in Gaza, even without aims 2 & 3 being achieved, even in the face of furious opposition from the hostage families.\n\n> The strikes in Tehran & Dahiyeh are hugely dangerous incidents that deserve to be discussed in their own threads, the chance for a prolonged conflict between Israel & Iran's proxies cannot be downplayed. But while they are connected, they are still distinct from the Gaza conflict\n\n> IMHO, the view that Israel's actions yesterday show a desperation on Netanyahu's part does not hold water. They are certainly dangerous, and risk increasing incidents of violence in the region, but they seem to me to be calculated towards ending the Gaza war on Netanyahu's terms\n\n> So while I do agree with analysis that says a ceasefire deal is dead in the water following Haniyeh's assassination, I do not necessarily agree that it proves Netanyahu wants to prolong the conflict in Gaza.\n\n> Rather, in my opinion, it potentially shows that Netanyahu is trying to end the conflict in Gaza (and only in Gaza) on his own terms, regardless of where that leaves hostage negotiations, and at the very serious risk of starting a new wider war with Iran's proxies.\n\n> I think those are prices Netanyahu and his cabinet are willing to pay to be able to declare a military victory over Hamas in Gaza. Will it work for him, internationally and/or domestically? I'm not a fortune teller & do not have the answer to that.\n\n> Much of that seems to depend on how the Israeli public will react to a declaration of \"victory\" on those terms & what further price Israel may pay from deciding to double down on escalation with Tehran. It also relies on the not insignificant remaining task of taking Sinwar out.\n\n> Major disclaimer, I'm not trying to justify, excuse or downplay the behaviour of any of the actors involved in this multi-front war, I am simply trying to analyse it from my own perspective as a Middle Eastern foreign policy analyst & conflict journalist.\n\n> Lastly, whatever Netanyahu declares, the reality on the ground in Gaza is not in his direct control. The Palestinians will not abandon militancy while they remain occupied & stateless, and my opinion remains that the Israel-Palestine conflict will only end with a just settlement.\n\n> With regards to Iran\u2019s calculations in this? All bets are off, Iran has been humiliated across multiple states in the same 24 hour period. Tehran doesn\u2019t have to sell anything to its public, but its image of projected regional strength has been shattered.\n> \n> I expect a response.",

I&#39;m not a fortune teller &amp; do not have the answer to that.</p>\n\n<p>Much of that seems to depend on how the Israeli public will react to a declaration of &quot;victory&quot; on those terms &amp; what further price Israel may pay from deciding to double down on escalation with Tehran. It also relies on the not insignificant remaining task of taking Sinwar out.</p>\n\n<p>Major disclaimer, I&#39;m not trying to justify, excuse or downplay the behaviour of any of the actors involved in this multi-front war, I am simply trying to analyse it from my own perspective as a Middle Eastern foreign policy analyst &amp; conflict journalist.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, whatever Netanyahu declares, the reality on the ground in Gaza is not in his direct control. The Palestinians will not abandon militancy while they remain occupied &amp; stateless, and my opinion remains that the Israel-Palestine conflict will only end with a just settlement.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to Iran\u2019s calculations in this? All bets are off, Iran has been humiliated across multiple states in the same 24 hour period. Tehran doesn\u2019t have to sell anything to its public, but its image of projected regional strength has been shattered.</p>\n\n<p>I expect a response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

They came up out of the Danube valley too late, and founded the beginnings of their nation long after the French and the English were well on their way to nationhood. They got too late to the scramble-rafEblonies and for the foundation of empire. Then, when they did get together and made a. united nation, they looked around them and saw the British, the French, and others with rich colonies and all the equipment of grown-up nations, and they became jealous, resentful, like a younger brother whose older brothers have taken the lion\u2019s share of the inheritance.</p>\n</div>",

There is a good reason why reductionist theories are discredited among historians: they are constructed by analyzing only a handful of events, and only from a handful of angles, so they are inherently impossible to validate. Their reductionist character provides a mold through which any fact can be explained, so not only do they not offer any historical insight, they *prevent* the extraction of any historical insight.\n\nCase in point: the notion that \"deep down\" (what does \"deep down\" even mean?) \"they\" (who, and what about everybody else?) \"wanted this war\"  pre-explains every single historical event to the point of uselesness. The real questions that historians have been struggling to answer for more than a century now are in a completely different vein: why was non-violent resolution of these particular international conflicts impossible? How much of it was a matter of policy and how much was flawed leadership? Did the people who opposed war, or saw the danger in it, fail to convince leaders not to embark on a violent course of action, and why? Were there any specific matters of national policy, something that ultimately left some leaders unable to escape this course of action? Failures of communication? Misunderstandings about the scope of military action? Miscalculations about their opponents' response?\n\nWithout answering these questions, all we're left with is the notion that war started because the people who started it really wanted to start it. That's not just useless, it's historically treacherous because it's a blank canvas against which one can project any historical theory and it works as if by magic.\n\nAnd of course it works, as every flaw pointed out in a sufficiently reductionist theory is trivially retorted by restating the original premise.

The Minuteman III is *by far* the world's oldest ICBM still in active use as part of a nation's nuclear triad. It was originally deployed in 1970 and only had a planned service life of 10 years. It's only still operational over 50 years later because of life extension programmes but at some point, a thing is so old that there's no life left to extend.\n\nThe former STRATCOM Chief had this to say about the situation:\n\n>\u201cLet me be very clear: You cannot life-extend the Minuteman III \\[any longer\\],\u201d he said of the 400 ICBMs that sit in underground silos across five states in the upper Midwest.\n\n>\u201cWe can\u2019t do it at all. ... That thing is so old that, in some cases, the drawings don\u2019t exist anymore \\[to guide upgrades\\],\u201d Richard said in a Zoom conference sponsored by the Defense Writers Group.\n\n>Where the drawings do exist, \u201cthey\u2019re like six generations behind the industry standard,\u201d he said, adding that there are also no technicians who fully understand them. \u201cThey\u2019re not alive anymore.\u201d\n\nWe joke about questionable operational readiness of Russian ICBMs but in reality, Russia has significantly more modern ICBMs in service than the US. If anything, it's the US that should be worried about the operational readiness of its ICBMs. This is *especially* prominent after the highly publicising failure of one of the US' Minuteman III tests last November. Sure, two missile tests worked in June but given the recency of the previous failure, another failure would have spelled absolute disaster for the US' nuclear credibility so I'm sure extra care and attention to detail was taken in ensuring that failure was not even a possibility.\n\nWith this in mind, the USAF can only drop Sentinel *if* the US decides that it can forgo the land portion of its nuclear triad completely in the future. Whether or not American political leadership will accept this is anyone's guess but if I had to place bets, I highly doubt either the Democrats nor the Republicans will want to be seen as the party that dropped one leg of the US' nuclear triad, however unnecessary that leg may be.\n\nGiven that USAF officials were making claims stating NGAD would cost in the \"multiple hundreds of millions\", likely in the $300M+ range, there was no realistic way the USAF would have ever been able to afford any appreciable amount of NGAD jets with the fiscal constraints the US military now has to operate under. The US military of today is operating on a peacetime budget whilst at the same time upgrading all three legs of its nuclear triad simultaneously *and* developing multiple *very ambitious* next-generation combat aircraft. Even under a Cold War-level budget, this would have been an extremely difficult undertaking. Under a peacetime budget, this is essentially a complete impossibility which is why the US has put the brakes on what it has determined to be the project with the least amount of national importance on a strategic scale.\n\nRegardless, by the 2030s, China's local superiority in terms of firepower, strategic depth, numerical supremacy and so on will be extremely great, likely even completely insurmountable. It's *highly* unlikely that NGAD would be able to turn the tide regardless of how good it is. NGAD would still need runways and air bases to operate from and China, through the PLARF, has made it its mission to develop the capabilities to systematically target and destroy American assets and FOBs in the region. Without safe places to launch NGAD jets from or sufficiently operational bases to enable a high enough sortie rate to even make a difference in the air war against numerically superior enemies, it doesn't really matter how good NGAD is in the air.\n\nUntil the US chooses to invest in the capabilities and solutions necessary to tackle this problem, the US will continue sleepwalking into a scenario where their only possible response to a Taiwan invasion is public condemnation.",

There is no money to expand shipyards and increase production in any significant way and submarine production is progressing at a glacial pace, with the US being unable to produce SSNs and SSBNs at the rate it needs to *let alone* produce surplus SSNs for Australia.\n\nThe US Army has also been forced to consistently delay replacements for aging platforms like the Bradley, Abrams, Apache, Chinook and so on.

                            "body": "I'm sorry, my own writing was sloppy. You are perfectly right and we don't disagree at all, we're referring to the same thing, I just didn't do it very well.\n\nIn modern (roughly in the age of UN) practice, nobody really wants to \"formally annex\" a territory per se because that is universally recognized as an illegal practice. That's why everyone needs to do some legal gymnastics about it (passing domestic laws to give it the appearance of legitimate civilian control, organize referendums, work around the definition of annexation by acknowledging only a temporary control etc.). When I sloppily wrote \"not formally annexed by Israel, but they did issue a law that amounts to just as much\", I didn't mean that Israel didn't use the word \"annexation\" (nobody does), I meant to refer to how the state of Israel justifies it in term of international and Israeli law.\n\nIn 1981, Israel passed the Golan Heights Law, whose first provision stated that \"the Law, jurisdiction and administration of the State will take effect in the Golan Heights\". This was more or less the standard juridical practice of Israel at the time for claiming previously occupied territory, i.e. \"promoting\" territory under military occupation to territory under civilian administration, thus making it, as you've said, \"a part of the country like any other\". \n\n(Edit:) The \"not formally\" part is specific to this particular practice. A similar procedure was used to annex East Jerusalem (i.e. the Jerusalem Law), which effectively relies on the 1967 annexation of West Jerusalem. There is an entire line of legal justification among a minority of Israeli legal scholars that that was not a form of annexation because it did not formally proclaim sovereignty over that territory e.g. through its foreign ministry, but merely an administrative decision to extend municipal and social services to all of the city's citizens, making it entirely a domestic matter. It's a minority view that was in fact dispelled by the Israeli Supreme Court in a ruling which found that the 1967 \"administrative\" decisions amounted to annexing that territory, even though they didn't explicitly say so. Most countries will go through extensive legal gymnastics to claim that they didn't annex anything. Israel is one of the exceptions, in that its Supreme Court recognized annexation as such.\n\nThe status of the Golan heights is murky not because of this legal framework but because of the difficult demarkation and the complicated set of mutual recognition among actors that govern it. The Golan Law simply refers to \"the Golan Heights\" but that's a wider geographical area than Israel occupies, and some of it is under Syrian control. \n\nIn practice it applies to the area up to the UNDOF Zone, but then the actual line of demarkation between Israel and Syria is on the Purple Line, and it's just a line of armistice. In terms of recognition, the UN recognizes it as Syrian territory, but at least one permanent UNSC member (i.e. the US) does not, which leaves the UN pretty much unable to issue a binding statement on it. However, the UN *has already* issued a binding statement on it (Resolution 497), declaring the Golan Heights Law null and void, back when the US didn't recognize it as Israeli territory.",

You are perfectly right and we don&#39;t disagree at all, we&#39;re referring to the same thing, I just didn&#39;t do it very well.</p>\n\n<p>In modern (roughly in the age of UN) practice, nobody really wants to &quot;formally annex&quot; a territory per se because that is universally recognized as an illegal practice. That&#39;s why everyone needs to do some legal gymnastics about it (passing domestic laws to give it the appearance of legitimate civilian control, organize referendums, work around the definition of annexation by acknowledging only a temporary control etc.). When I sloppily wrote &quot;not formally annexed by Israel, but they did issue a law that amounts to just as much&quot;, I didn&#39;t mean that Israel didn&#39;t use the word &quot;annexation&quot; (nobody does), I meant to refer to how the state of Israel justifies it in term of international and Israeli law.</p>\n\n<p>In 1981, Israel passed the Golan Heights Law, whose first provision stated that &quot;the Law, jurisdiction and administration of the State will take effect in the Golan Heights&quot;. This was more or less the standard juridical practice of Israel at the time for claiming previously occupied territory, i.e. &quot;promoting&quot; territory under military occupation to territory under civilian administration, thus making it, as you&#39;ve said, &quot;a part of the country like any other&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>(Edit:) The &quot;not formally&quot; part is specific to this particular practice. A similar procedure was used to annex East Jerusalem (i.e. the Jerusalem Law), which effectively relies on the 1967 annexation of West Jerusalem. There is an entire line of legal justification among a minority of Israeli legal scholars that that was not a form of annexation because it did not formally proclaim sovereignty over that territory e.g. through its foreign ministry, but merely an administrative decision to extend municipal and social services to all of the city&#39;s citizens, making it entirely a domestic matter. It&#39;s a minority view that was in fact dispelled by the Israeli Supreme Court in a ruling which found that the 1967 &quot;administrative&quot; decisions amounted to annexing that territory, even though they didn&#39;t explicitly say so. Most countries will go through extensive legal gymnastics to claim that they didn&#39;t annex anything. Israel is one of the exceptions, in that its Supreme Court recognized annexation as such.</p>\n\n<p>The status of the Golan heights is murky not because of this legal framework but because of the difficult demarkation and the complicated set of mutual recognition among actors that govern it. The Golan Law simply refers to &quot;the Golan Heights&quot; but that&#39;s a wider geographical area than Israel occupies, and some of it is under Syrian control. </p>\n\n<p>In practice it applies to the area up to the UNDOF Zone, but then the actual line of demarkation between Israel and Syria is on the Purple Line, and it&#39;s just a line of armistice. In terms of recognition, the UN recognizes it as Syrian territory, but at least one permanent UNSC member (i.e. the US) does not, which leaves the UN pretty much unable to issue a binding statement on it. However, the UN <em>has already</em> issued a binding statement on it (Resolution 497), declaring the Golan Heights Law null and void, back when the US didn&#39;t recognize it as Israeli territory.</p>\n</div>",

That&#39;s a wholly different calculation, because both countries lay claim to the same land.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t dissuade you from believing in some all-conquering spirit of human justice, but looking at the history books, I see a lot of different stories.</p>\n</div>",

They were dominated by the Ottomans first, then the British, and finally Israel. But so did Syria[x], Lebanon[x] Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, etc... for the two former empires and no one in its right mind would question the right for these countries to exist.

It is unlikely to be a coincidence that this was after Saudi Arabia made peace with the Houthis, and as the US has now shown, there is limited capability for the US to defeat them. Worse yet, such a deal would now certainly need resources the US wants to allocate to the Pacific.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is also the fact that even before Oct. 7th, the deal required concessions from Israel to Palestine even beyond the West Bank. This is a serious problem beyond just Israeli domestic politics, because not every administration would be willing to put significant pressure on Israel to do so. This part was not even started yet, and White House officials expected it to take another 6-12 months to hash out, while insiders in Israel said that it was unlikely Israel would agree even to minor concessions since the agreement entailed Saudi nuclear capabilities.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the deal would require a 2/3rds majority in the Senate. This means that Israel has to avoid incidents and continue accepting their end of the deal long enough for this kind of treaty to go through - time during which Iran and it's proxies will surely fan the flames. It will take a while for Israel to go back to a state where it can tolerate significant provocation on the issue, just as Israeli politics become more and more inflamed with every passing administration.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that MBS currently unusual amounts of political capital in Saudi Arabia - the kind that is needed for this decision which signals a large commitment in foreign policy, consequences wrt the (historically) important and underestimated relationship with China and which will cause significant push back. There is no guarantee that MBS will be able to deploy this amount of political capital in the future, both domestically and in the Arab League: despite portrayal as an all powerful dictator, he does not have absolute power, and he would be taking a significant risk in going through with this deal - this is one of the very few topics where the Saudis cannot clamp down on public outcry, and it's therefore a good opportunity for his opponents to exploit. Even before Oct. 7th, the Saudi press was critical or the idea.\u00a0\n\n\nMeanwhile, the US has less and less resources to dedicate to the Middle East, and Iran has more and more influence and resource - this is the pacing dynamic against normalization just as much as it is a driver, because just as much as Iranian influence\u00a0motivates Saudi Arabia to normalize, it also increases the cost on the US side and impacts the credibility that the US will consider this a priority going forwards while competing with China.\n\n\n\nSo, the process of normalization is far from guaranteed.
