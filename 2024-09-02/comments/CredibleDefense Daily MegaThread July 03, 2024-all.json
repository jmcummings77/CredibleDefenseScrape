Annual inflation stood at 7.4% in 2023, down from 11.9% in 2022.\n\n\nThe discrepancy between Russia's inflation and interest rates continues to widen. The situation is so absurd that putting money in the bank gives a much better return than the S&P 500, even adjusted for inflation.\n\n\nWith the deficits that Russia is running, someone needs to own the debt, and it's certainly not going to be foreign investors. But this situation creates crazy incentives.\n\n\nFor example, why would anyone run a company with the risk of bankruptcy when having money in the bank is more profitable? Are there even any independent companies left in Russia at this point?\n\n\nInterestingly, Russia's initial\u00a0budget for 2024 [spends less](https://x.com/jakluge/status/1808241780082503862) on the state defense program than in the previous year - obviously that won't be the case now - with spending going down even more in 2025 and 2026. If Putin is planning for a long war, why isn't the ministry of finance?",

Are there even any independent companies left in Russia at this point?\n\nIronically enough, it creates the *right* incentives if you're at the government end. Russia needs to borrow a lot to sustain its war effort. A lot as in they plan to double the amount they're borrowing to finance their deficit over the next few years. See e.g. [this report](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-double-costs-servicing-state-debt-by-2026-war-costs-grow-2023-09-29/) based on draft budget documents from last year.\n\nSince most sectors of the international financial market that are actually useful at these levels are closed to them, the Russian government has no choice but to borrow domestically, so high amounts of cash in Russian banks are useful. High rates discourage borrowers from the private sector, too, so banks have an extra incentive to play ball with the state, which does sit on a giant stash of cash and a promise to maybe get some more of it from abroad after the war, so as far as their private banks are concerned right now, it's not a completely absurd idea to lend them the money, especially considering the alternatives.\n\nIt's a pretty risky bet. If all this money gets dumped into expendable war gear, or worse, if it ends up covering increasingly larger sign-on payments and wages for contract military personnel, then some of these hikes will just seep straight into the inflation they're supposed to keep in check. On the other hand, the Russian government has considerable leverage over its domestic banking sector, and a long tradition of informal control over the private sector in general, so it carries less risk than if a Western government were to do it and it's something they have experience with.\n\n> With the deficits that Russia is running, someone needs to own the debt, and it's certainly not going to be foreign investors.\n\nWell, that will depend a bit on foreign investors, but it doesn't need to be foreign investors, no. Depending on who's going to finance the government's deficit, the might end up being owned by... slightly more flexible investors, like the Russian National Wealth Fund (the majority shareholder of Sberbank) or Gazfond, Gazprom's pension fund and majority shareholder of Gazprombank.\n\nAs for foreign investors, the major issue right now is that Russian money is kind of radioactive so nobody wants to own *short-term* Russian debt, because cashing in on them would be either risky (if they end up working with sanctioned entities) or useless (if they get paid in roubles). Long-term Russian debt is kind of a different story. Sufficiently large organisations (e.g. Unicredit, especially its Austrian branches) or sufficiently interested organisations (smaller Chinese investment firms without much involvement on Western markets, or even larger firms without much *direct* involvement) probably don't have an issue with it.",
