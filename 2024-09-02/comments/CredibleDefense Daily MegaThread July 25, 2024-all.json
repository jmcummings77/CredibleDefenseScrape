The new howitzer's integration with the KTSSM missile launcher chassis demonstrates its adaptability to different operational environments, potentially offering logistical and tactical flexibility.\n\n> Moreover, Hanwha's new turret is designed for modular compatibility, like the AGM 155 found on the RCH 155, allowing it to be mounted on various vehicles beyond its primary chassis, which could benefit interoperability and ease of integration with different military systems.

Many diplomats <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_expulsions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War\">have been expelled from the EU</a> and countries are imposing movement restrictions on the remaining ones (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-introduce-restrictions-movement-russian-diplomats-2024-05-27/\">for example in Poland</a>). There&#39;s also talk of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eight-eu-countries-call-restricting-russian-diplomats-movement-2024-06-13/\">doing this at the EU level</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The important change isn&#39;t just that they&#39;re hiring locals (they always did that), but that they&#39;re much more hands-off. Locals are coordinating other locals, while their GRU handler is working from home in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>But of course, you&#39;re right, that&#39;s far from the only reason. The new system scales better. Plausibile deniability and the disposability of the recruits are definitely also very important factors.</p>\n</div>",

RUSI had reported lancets were challenged where EW was running, and lacked lethality, even though playing main role for counterbattery.  Did they improve significantly sine then?\n\nedit: per Rusi (my emphasis added)\n\nReconnaissance-Fire System\n\nThe reconnaissance-fire system (recce-fire) is a development of a Soviet-era concept designed to pair tactical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets with precision strike artillery in real time. Strelets is the implementation of this concept, connecting sensors to shooters in as close to real time as possible. Recce-fire requires the target to be engaged with precision munitions such as the 2K25 Krasnopol 152mm laser-guided round. Target designation can be provided by ground-based laser systems or the Orlan-30 UAV. Video footage showing precise strikes on Ukrainian vehicles or buildings is likely a result of Krasnopol use. **Prior to the war, recce-fire was expected to be critical for counter-battery engagements. Ground-based laser targeting is evident, but some Russian documents indicate that the Russian armed forces have struggled to get forward observers to perform their role in Ukraine. Many prefer to use UAVs, a safer but potentially less effective solution.** The efficacy of Krasnopol has also been challenged. One Russian textbook on artillery indicates that Krasnopol\u2019s accuracy is severely degraded by low-hanging cloud cover, variable terrain and a host of other conditions that make it a difficult munition to deploy.\n\nHowever, Russia has made extensive use of loitering munitions like Lancet-3, which can be coordinated with a separate UAV to conduct reconnaissance and targeting or flown manually to search for and strike individual targets. **This is likely a response to several factors: Ukraine\u2019s use of dispersed guns, the availability of Krasnopol and the associated targeting assets, as well as the presence of electronic warfare, which degrades Lancet considerably.** Ukrainian commanders told the author that while Lancet is more prevalent in some areas than artillery, in others it is rarely seen. **The use of Lancet also suggests that Russia has struggled to counter dispersion with its pre-existing targeting structures and doctrine. The gunnery problem means that while a single howitzer in a tree line might be quickly identified, the chances of hitting it with unguided munitions are low unless excessive mass is applied. When considered against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s own ammunition challenges, the use of loitering munitions is therefore a logical alternative. However, the lethality of Lancet is often insufficient. it is apparent from videos that crews can hear the munition approaching, as they often have time to disperse before it strikes. One officer also said that although he had seen his gun \u2018destroyed\u2019 several times online, it remained alive and well.**\n\nhttps://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russias-artillery-war-ukraine-challenges-and-innovations",

It doesn't even need to be a negative rate. The Russian government depends significantly on Western pressure on Ukraine for that, and no Western government wants to be the one pressuring UAF to stand down when the public is hopeful for their chances. And b) maintaining sufficiently low economic pressure that Russia can sit at the negotiations table for long enough to draw out significant concessions.\n2. Medium/long-term: establishing a solid enough logistical base to support a later offensive. Doesn't mean they *plan* to, but they need one if the threat of another invasion is to be a credible deterrent in the future. They can't do that without frozen contact lines.\n\nThe exact administrative limits aren't that important. For one thing, Russia can just create a Kherson Federal Oblast spanning the territory they currently control and there you have it, they now have Kherson (and a claim over the rest of it in the future). It sounds ridiculous but the Soviet Union did exactly that, a bunch of times.\n\nNow obviously I don't know even 1% of what the RuAF staff knows. For all we know a large-scale collapse is just around the corner. But if that's not the case, these minimal objectives do at least provide with a base on which to build a campaign that would bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere of influence in a 20-30-year timeframe, and prevent any future Ukrainian administration from working against that policy (through e.g. NATO membership, an independent foreign and economic policy as an EU member etc.).\n\nThing is if the meat grinder turns off, all of this goes away. It's critical for RuAF to at least keep the UAF engaged until negotiations start, and have a menacing enough posture during negotiations to force the Ukrainian's government hand.

A fighter plane outmatched by other long-range planes (say a scenario where you get targeted by a Mig-31 or the like firing R-33s or R-37s) could then choose to shoot his missiles for self-defense.\n\n(This concept could also be applied to AWACS or other high-value planes targeted by such missiles. Also maybe this could work with long-range SAM systems like the S-400).\n\nI understand that these long range missiles have very high speeds, but assuming these are decelerating in the final gliding approach phase, an interception wouldn't be too hard? There are other issues like the missile IR signature which might not be hot enough for an IR missile (since the engine would have been shut down already), but maybe a variant guided by the plane radar could work?\n\nAnother issue I can think of is that you would need a good radar on the plane to track incoming missiles, but maybe you could get this info by datalink from some AWACS or the like?\n\nSo basically I was just daydreaming about such a concept and my question is whether this concept is still too ahead of the curve, or whether this would be credible in the near future.\n\nThanks for sharing any input on this.",
