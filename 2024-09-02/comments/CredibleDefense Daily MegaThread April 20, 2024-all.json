As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Point is, the numbers suggest they have reserves left for a long time, but since [they removed fewer BMPs/BTRs than Oryx-confirmed losses](https://twitter.com/HighMarsed/status/1720030940720685521), we know either their numbers are dwindling or the satellite imagery under-estimates the losses. On the other hand, Russia still had a lot of BTR-80s left according to the MB2023: 1450, but [they have nearly disappeared from the battlefield recently](https://twitter.com/verekerrichard1/status/1781761853149823058/photo/1). There are 3 main possible explanations: Russia has plenty of better AFV/IFVs to use and don't need them, but judging by how many troops are riding armored vehicles and using ATVs that's extremely doubtful; Russia has changed what equipment they bring on assaults and I'd agree they have because [the ratio of IFVs/AFVs for each tank lost has increased a lot](https://twitter.com/verekerrichard1/status/1781685766030033199/photo/1), which means we should see more of everything they can put back into service; finally, Russia is having a hard time putting certain equipment back in service, one might be tempted to say older equipment, but they use plenty of older MT-LBs. Conclusion: either they don't have large reserves of AFV/IFVs OR they're unable to put them in service fast enough to replace all the losses. That implies that they could make do with the vehicles in better shape, but those run out eventually.\n\n* Artillery shells: if Russia wasn't running out of its own shells they wouldn't need to buy millions of them from NK. Of course, they won't ever completely run out so long as they can keep their production going, but they can certainly run on very low levels and that would be a disaster for the Russian army that can't go on the offense or make a sound defense without it. Now, they're not reaching such low levels anytime soon, but unless NK is willing to give everything they got (and with the shipments ending over 2 months ago, it's likely that they completely stopped), or China/India decides to step in and open their stores: 2025 is going to be shell hunger year for Russia.",

That attack, intercepted by Israel and its allies, caused minimal damage.\n\n**The two Iranian officials** said the weapon had struck an S-300 antiaircraft system at a military base in the nearby province of Isfahan. The officials\u2019 account is supported by satellite imagery analyzed by The New York Times, which showed damage to the radar of an S-300 system at the Eighth Shekari Air Base in Isfahan.\n\nIt was unclear what sort of weapon struck the Iranian air defense system. Three Western and two Iranian officials confirmed on Friday that Israel had deployed aerial drones and at least one missile fired from a warplane. Previously, Iranian officials said the attack on the military base had been conducted by small drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory.\n\nA missile, two Western officials said, was fired from a warplane far from Israeli or Iranian airspace and included technology that enabled it to evade Iran\u2019s radar defenses. Neither the missile nor the aircraft that fired it entered Jordanian airspace, the Western officials said, a gesture meant to keep the kingdom out of the conflict after it helped shoot down Iranian weapons last week.\n\n**The two Iranian officials said that Iran\u2019s military had not detected anything entering Iran\u2019s airspace on Friday**, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran\u2019s state news agency, IRNA, reported that no missile attacks had occurred and that Iran\u2019s air defense system had not been activated.\n\nIsrael, the two Western officials said, had scrapped an earlier plan to fire back on Iran with a large-scale attack. That plan, they said, was replaced with a strike intended to send a quiet but decisive message with the aim of ending the cycle of reprisal.\n\n**Israel\u2019s use of drones launched from inside Iran and a missile that it could not detect**, the Western officials said, was intended to give Iran a taste of what a larger-scale attack might look like. The attack, they said, was calibrated to make Iran think twice before launching a direct attack on Israel in the future.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found.\n\nImages showed that the precision attack at the Eighth Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the \u201cflap-lid\u201d radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets.\n\nThe Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers.\n\nThe radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers.\n\nOther areas of the air base and adjacent airport also appeared to be undamaged. **The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system.**\n\nAccording to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes.",

Every effing European country will continue to have a minister of defense, a procurement office, an anemic air force and a more or less credible land force, and every country with different weapon systems and communication equipment.\n\nThere is no common vision, and no one cares to develop one.

It's not just about escalation though, Ukraine actually defeating Russia also risks destabilizing Russia itself which is another thing the policymakers want to avoid. \n\nAs long as the conflict is \"balanced\" appropriately, the costs for Russia will remain high.

If one wants Russia to pay the highest possible price, then dragging the conflict out as long as possible would be the best strategy to achieve that. Which means that you can't let either side be too successful. \n\nAnother thing I'd say is that there's another benefit in USA wavering on its commitments to Ukraine, it puts more pressure on EU to do more.

I would consider such a step by Trump as more of an 'escalation' towards EU rather than USA changing its foreign policy approach, of course that's assuming he doesn't actually completely pull out of NATO. \n\nThere is one more thing to watch out for, the aid bill had a provision that stated that a strategy for Ukrainian victory has to be provided in ~45 days.
