It is already struggling to provide even the basics to the currently mobilised.\n\n\u201cThis would require putting the economy on a full war footing. Russia is already short of uniforms, weapons, medicine, food, accommodation and training. \"There are plenty of people, but not enough guns, bulletproof vests, sleeping bags, vehicles,\" a source tells Verstka.\n\n\u201cVerstka says that according to a source in the Russian Far East military district, there are currently neither organisational, nor material resources for full mobilisation, nor even for any large-scale second wave of mobilisation. \n\n\u201cEven the first wave is hardly 'digestible',\" the source says. \"There will be nowhere to train people, nowhere to arm and in some cases even feed them\".\n\n\u201cAnother source says that he was at the Chebarkul training ground in Tomsk region and describes it as being \"completely fucked up\", which led to protests by the mobilised men because of poor supplies and the poor quality of training.\n\n\u201cDiscussions of full mobilisation were tempered by the realisation that problems with the training and equipping of the mobilised \"cannot be solved so easily, in a couple of months\".\n\n\u201cNonetheless, more mobilisation will soon be needed because the currently mobilised are being used up rapidly.\n\n\"Obviously, the current [mobilised] will run out, more people will be needed, according to our calculations, by as soon as the end of winter\", says Verstka's source. \u201c\n\n\u201cThe Russian government is said to be preparing for a fresh partial mobilisation by hurriedly \"patching up the holes\" in the production and preparation of basic necessities for soldiers, as well as weapons and other equipment.\n\n\u201cThe first mobilisation revealed major problems with the performance of military registration and enlistment offices, which are being reformed in response. The \"Horizon-MR\" military enrolment computer system is being linked to other Russian government databases.\n\n\u201cThis is being done to ensure that the commissariats will be better prepared and have more accurate lists of those subject to mobilisation. The government is also said to be preparing new regional mobilisation centres and training new military instructors.\n\n\u201cThe next wave is likely to begin in the New Year, though its exact timing is unclear. Verstka notes that while the end of the initial mobilisation was announced on 28 October, no presidential decree to that effect was issued.\n\n\u201cIts sources claim the lack of a fresh decree was deliberately intended to leave open the possibility of future waves of mobilisation. According to one lawyer, it could even open the door to a general mobilisation, if it was decided that would be necessary.\n\nhttps://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1595377037451083776.html\n\nSource: https://verstka.media/pochemu-ne-budet-vseobshey-mobilizacii/",

The days are short and dark, and the weather is too cold and wet to be outdoors much but still too warm and rainy to enjoy the real Russian winter.\n\n>This year, the feeling of melancholy is increased by the sight of shuttered shops on many of the capital\u2019s streets, as businesses face the economic fall-out from massive Western sanctions in response to the war in Ukraine, which Russian officials still call the \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe mood in Moscow and the country is now extremely gloomy, quiet, intimidated, and hopeless,\u201d said 34-year-old Lisa, who declined to give her last name and said she was a film producer. \u201cThe planning horizon is as low as ever. People have no idea what might happen tomorrow or in a year.\u201d\n\n>While the shelves in most stores remain well stocked, Western products are becoming increasingly scarce and very expensive, further driving prices that are already hammering many Russian households.\n\n>>\u201cFamiliar goods disappear, starting from toilet paper and Coca-Cola, ending with clothes,\u201d said Lisa.\n\n>\u201cOf course, you can get used to all this, this is not the worst thing at all,\u201d she said. But she also took a jab at Western governments and companies that have left the Russian market in response to the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI do not really know how this helps in resolving the conflict, because it affects ordinary people, not those who make decisions,\u201d Lisa said.\n\n>Some economists believe Russia will face growing economic hardship and a population that will grow increasingly critical of the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d amid mounting defeats such as seen in Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Kherson, where a determined Ukrainian offensive forced a Russian withdrawal.\n\n>Sergey Javoronkov, a senior researcher at the Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy, says the mood is already more critical than it was, thanks to \u201cboth the economic price and the dissatisfaction with the task not being solved,\u201d contrary to the expectations created by the Kremlin.\n\n>>\u201cWe were supposed to win. Officials promised to capture Kyiv in three days but, as we see, it turned out to be foolish,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n>In his February 24 speech, (Russian President) Vladimir Putin stated that the military operations would be conducted only by professional troops. But in September a partial mobilization was declared \u2013 also an unpopular measure: those who do not want to fight are being recruited.\n\n>>\u201cIt is a known effect: a short victorious war may provoke enthusiasm, but if the war lasts endlessly and does not lead to the desired outcome, then comes disappointment.\u201d\n\n>A 30-year-old PR manager who gave her name only as Irina disagrees, saying she believes the situation is stabilizing after an initial exodus of Russians fleeing not only Western sanctions but also possible conscription following Putin\u2019s September 21 announcement of a nationwide partial mobilization.\n\n>The Kremlin says more than 300,000 Russians were drafted into the military between late September and early November while hundreds of thousands of mostly young Russian men fled the country, often to places like Kazakhstan or Georgia.\n\n>\u201cThe first wave of panic has already passed, everyone has calmed down a little. Many have left, but many remain. I am pleased with the people who stay and support Russia,\u201d Irina told CNN.\n\n>At the same time, she emphasized that she is opposed to the war in Ukraine, as it is beginning to sink in for her, as for many Russians, that the fighting may go on for a very long time. This is especially the case since Ukraine\u2019s forces managed to take back the major city of Kherson from the Russian military \u2013 an area Russia had annexed in September and which Putin had said would remain part of Russia \u201cforever.\u201d\n\n>\u201cI have a negative attitude. I believe that any aggression or war are evil. And to say that if we wouldn\u2019t attack them, they would attack us is of course absurd,\u201d Irina said, referring to Putin\u2019s repeated claim that Russia is acting in self-defense in its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n>Targeting Ukrainian infrastructure\n\n>Well-known Russian blogger Dmitry Puchkov, who goes by the name \u201cGoblin\u201d and supports his country\u2019s military operation in Ukraine, acknowledges that the recent battlefield defeats have shaken many people\u2019s trust.\n\n>\u201cFrom the point of view of civil society, it is not good for our troops to leave the territories that have become part of the Russian Federation. But we think it\u2019s a tactical move and it won\u2019t last long,\u201d he wrote, answering written questions from CNN online. Puchkov says he believes Russia will fight back fiercely and force Ukraine into a ceasefire.\n\n>\u201cThe morale of the Russian military is very high,\u201d Puchkov wrote, as he laid out how he thinks victory will be achieved. \u201cThe necessary strategic decisions are well known: first and foremost is the destruction of the Ukrainian infrastructure. The electricity, hot water and heat systems must be destroyed,\u201d he said.\n\n>The Kremlin appears to be following that playbook. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted power infrastructure in Ukraine in recent weeks, leaving more than 7 million people without power after one wave of strikes a week ago, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\n>Ukrainians remain resolute in the face of Russian missile attacks, however, and hopes for any kind of negotiated end to the war remain distant, even as America\u2019s top general pushes for diplomacy. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday called for greater support for Ukraine, telling NATO allies: \u201cWe must be prepared to support Ukraine for the long haul.\u201d\n\n>Missing Western technology\n\n>Asked what the mood is like in the Russian business community given the prospects of a prolonged conflict, Javoronkov used a single word: \u201cPessimistic!\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe economic experts realize that nothing is expected for the economy if the military actions continue,\u201d Javoronkov said. Russia\u2019s economy is now officially in a recession, which he believes will only get worse.\n\n>The country\u2019s industrial firms are facing major problems replacing Western technology, leading the automobile company AvtoVAZ \u2013 manufacturer of the Lada vehicle brand \u2013 to first halt production earlier this year and then move to producing some vehicles without basic electronic features like air bags and anti-lock braking systems.\n\n>The problems span everything from the airline industry to consumer electronics, leading former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to call for a nationalization of foreign assets.\n\n>Yevgeny Popov, a well-known journalist and member of the Russian parliament, ripped into Medvedev\u2019s idea in a rare moment of open criticism.\n\n>\u201cWhat will we drive, we have nothing to drive. Are we going to drive railcars?\u201d Popov yelled at a former Russian general who supported the idea of nationalization on the state TV talk show \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n>\u201cLet\u2019s nationalize everything, but what will we drive, how will we make phone calls, what will we do? Yes, all our technology is Western,\u201d Popov said.\n\n>The Kremlin has been promoting the idea of replacing Western goods with products and technologies from allied countries such as China or Iran, but also of increasing Russia\u2019s own production.\n\n>On Monday, Putin opened \u2013 via videolink \u2013 a turkey breeding farm in the Tyumen region. The move was hailed as a sign of growing Russian economic independence by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who labeled it \u201ca significant event in the president\u2019s schedule related to the development of domestic breeding and selection of the meat and poultry sector of the agriculture industry. A crucial sector that is directly connected with Russia\u2019s food security.\u201d\n\n>But Russia\u2019s increasing isolation from the world is not necessarily welcomed by all its citizens. Film producer Lisa said she would rather have her country end the war and renew ties with foreign countries than go it alone.\n\n>\u201cI wait and hope that it will all end because there is nothing more valuable than human lives,\u201d she said.\n\nGoblin living up to his name, and Russia\u2019s now hyping up a\u2026Turkey breeding program.",

Puchkov says he believes Russia will fight back fiercely and force Ukraine into a ceasefire.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe morale of the Russian military is very high,\u201d Puchkov wrote, as he laid out how he thinks victory will be achieved. \u201cThe necessary strategic decisions are well known: first and foremost is the destruction of the Ukrainian infrastructure. The electricity, hot water and heat systems must be destroyed,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The Kremlin appears to be following that playbook. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted power infrastructure in Ukraine in recent weeks, leaving more than 7 million people without power after one wave of strikes a week ago, according to Ukrainian officials.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainians remain resolute in the face of Russian missile attacks, however, and hopes for any kind of negotiated end to the war remain distant, even as America\u2019s top general pushes for diplomacy. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday called for greater support for Ukraine, telling NATO allies: \u201cWe must be prepared to support Ukraine for the long haul.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Missing Western technology</p>\n\n<p>Asked what the mood is like in the Russian business community given the prospects of a prolonged conflict, Javoronkov used a single word: \u201cPessimistic!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe economic experts realize that nothing is expected for the economy if the military actions continue,\u201d Javoronkov said. Russia\u2019s economy is now officially in a recession, which he believes will only get worse.</p>\n\n<p>The country\u2019s industrial firms are facing major problems replacing Western technology, leading the automobile company AvtoVAZ \u2013 manufacturer of the Lada vehicle brand \u2013 to first halt production earlier this year and then move to producing some vehicles without basic electronic features like air bags and anti-lock braking systems.</p>\n\n<p>The problems span everything from the airline industry to consumer electronics, leading former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to call for a nationalization of foreign assets.</p>\n\n<p>Yevgeny Popov, a well-known journalist and member of the Russian parliament, ripped into Medvedev\u2019s idea in a rare moment of open criticism.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat will we drive, we have nothing to drive. Are we going to drive railcars?\u201d Popov yelled at a former Russian general who supported the idea of nationalization on the state TV talk show \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s nationalize everything, but what will we drive, how will we make phone calls, what will we do? Yes, all our technology is Western,\u201d Popov said.</p>\n\n<p>The Kremlin has been promoting the idea of replacing Western goods with products and technologies from allied countries such as China or Iran, but also of increasing Russia\u2019s own production.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Putin opened \u2013 via videolink \u2013 a turkey breeding farm in the Tyumen region. The move was hailed as a sign of growing Russian economic independence by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who labeled it \u201ca significant event in the president\u2019s schedule related to the development of domestic breeding and selection of the meat and poultry sector of the agriculture industry. A crucial sector that is directly connected with Russia\u2019s food security.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Russia\u2019s increasing isolation from the world is not necessarily welcomed by all its citizens. Film producer Lisa said she would rather have her country end the war and renew ties with foreign countries than go it alone.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI wait and hope that it will all end because there is nothing more valuable than human lives,\u201d she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Goblin living up to his name, and Russia\u2019s now hyping up a\u2026Turkey breeding program.</p>\n</div>",

Nothing hinges upon the war in Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>Whenever you have to appeal to the whole rules based intentional order thing to make a case for the importance of something, it\u2019s usually simply not important at all. </p>\n\n<p>Also the notion that wars of conquest don\u2019t happen now is simply false, see: The kargil war, Nagorno-Karabakh, the Chechen wars, the Russo-Georgian war.</p>\n</div>",

The most egregious example of course ironically being one that had the backing of the entire UN (wasn&#39;t unilateral like with most) versus Iraq in the 90s - which led to the deaths of over 500,000 children and saw the UN humanitarian coordinator in Baghdad resign saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to administer a programme that satisfies the definition of genocide&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re of course talking about the same Iraq that had just tried to deprive millions of people of their homeland.

            "body": "RE: the Gripen, the Swedes are in an awkward position re: sales, and like the article says their political backers dont do them any favors. In terms of capabilities the Gripen is set up as an F-16 killer (not literally, but in terms of sales). It has a similar, though slightly less payload, similar hardpoint layout, a better dogfight profile, and with the French Meteor missile its supposedly better at BVR. That does come with a caveat, radar and high altitude performance is as important in BVR as the missile itself. The F-16 has a very good radar, but the F-15 (and, well, F-22) remains king. On paper good. But the F-16, despite its popularity, isn't a fantastic fighter. Its definitely a budget US fighter. The F/A-18 has more hardpoints and can carry up more weapons, plus it has short takeoff capability. The F-15, F-22, and F-35 are all better in BVR, the former thanks to its expensive overbuild features and the latter two due to stealth. The F-22, and probably also the SU-35, is better in a dogfight. Just as important these days in high performance dogfighting are high off boresight A2A missiles like the AIM-9X. But if youre buying a plane to fight with the -9X, why not just buy American and cut out the hassle of converting a Swedish plane to an American missile? And anyway if you look forward the future does seem to be stealth and BVR, not the dogfight. \n\nThe F-35 has come at a great time for the US and a horrible one for the Gripen. It is a generational change which fortifies a midsized airforce against the future. Some stealth is better than none, and the F-35 can accomplish some or all of the missions the Gripen can, and do so natively using American tech. If you also assume that the AIM-220 or whatever they call it is going to be the real deal, now is the time to get into American tech. Because youre opting into a technology ecosystem which will (probably) receive new systems for decades, and of the kind that even today most cant really envision. Will the Gripen get the AIM-220 or an analogue? What about Autonomous wingmen? What about some laser intercept system? What about some weird tech that even the US doesn't know it wants right now? Buy the F-35 and whatever bullshit America builds itself you'll eventually get to buy. Buy the Gripen right now, and maybe in 15 years you'll be buying a new jet to cover for the features the Gripen doesn't have. And of course if you actually plan to *use* your aircraft, who knows what the political situation in Sweden will be in 15 years. Maybe they'll be behind your enemies and so cut off access to spare parts. France & the US wont do that. Russia and China wont do that. A moderate increase in upfront cost is much preferable to the uncertainty of betting on the Swedish arms industry to deliver, it hasn't before and it may not in the future. But Lockheed Martin always delivers.",

And anyway if you look forward the future does seem to be stealth and BVR, not the dogfight. </p>\n\n<p>The F-35 has come at a great time for the US and a horrible one for the Gripen. It is a generational change which fortifies a midsized airforce against the future. Some stealth is better than none, and the F-35 can accomplish some or all of the missions the Gripen can, and do so natively using American tech. If you also assume that the AIM-220 or whatever they call it is going to be the real deal, now is the time to get into American tech. Because youre opting into a technology ecosystem which will (probably) receive new systems for decades, and of the kind that even today most cant really envision. Will the Gripen get the AIM-220 or an analogue? What about Autonomous wingmen? What about some laser intercept system? What about some weird tech that even the US doesn&#39;t know it wants right now? Buy the F-35 and whatever bullshit America builds itself you&#39;ll eventually get to buy. Buy the Gripen right now, and maybe in 15 years you&#39;ll be buying a new jet to cover for the features the Gripen doesn&#39;t have. And of course if you actually plan to <em>use</em> your aircraft, who knows what the political situation in Sweden will be in 15 years. Maybe they&#39;ll be behind your enemies and so cut off access to spare parts. France &amp; the US wont do that. Russia and China wont do that. A moderate increase in upfront cost is much preferable to the uncertainty of betting on the Swedish arms industry to deliver, it hasn&#39;t before and it may not in the future. But Lockheed Martin always delivers.</p>\n</div>",

They looked at the outside of the aircraft and saw something that would have good low speed characteristics. Then the Mig-25 started setting altitude and speed records, proving it was ALSO a very capable high altitude interceptor (which is what it was actually designed to do, the MiG-25 is horrible in the dogfight). So the F-15 was built to be able to fly high, go fast, fight at long ranges, and be very good at dogfight ranges. \n\nThe whole aircraft is built around two *very good* engines. The F-15 is fast and, more importantly, climbs well. It has a maximum service altitude higher than the F-16, for example, flies faster, and preforms better in a straight line. Combine that with a much larger and therefor more powerful radar, the F-15 can \u2018see\u2019 further than virtually any other fighter in its generation. Which means it\u2019ll look you up sooner. And because it\u2019s higher and faster, it can engage you sooner with more dangerous missiles. Plus the F-15 is a missile truck, it has something like 14 missile hard points compared to the F-16s 8. It makes the F-15 *very* good in its intended role. It can sit 40-50NM behind the line of contact and just hang out, it also has a HUGE fuel capacity so it can loiter forever. Then when the enemy looks askance at them, the F-15 climbs quickly up to combat altitude and fires first. A pair of F-15s can lockdown airspace against a much larger mig/flanker force, unless the flanker fights as it was designed which was specifically to counter the F-15. They were designed to go low, keep the radar off, and use infrared equipment to surprise the F-15 from below. Unfortunately that\u2019s much easier said then done especially with AWACS support. The drawback to the F-15 is it\u2019s cost. The C variant costs about twice that of the comparable F-16 block 50 while the modernized EX is even more expensive than the F-35. You get what you pay for, but if you want the best you have to pay the most and even the USAF isn\u2019t really able to sustain that. \n\nAs a fun fact though, the F-15 is the best preforming fighter as ratio of kills to losses.

So most of these pictures are for internal propaganda consumption, meaning if the HARM is introduced into the theater, they will go with that missile for awhile to show &quot;the big bad west&quot; to their internal audience. Here they likely chose a NASAM/AIM to highlight the new system to their audience.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, I don&#39;t actually doubt that some stray missile here or there have hit residential places, but Russia&#39;s volume (and timing of the release) of these events have lost all credibility with me. So if they were actually able to produce a real one I wouldn&#39;t actually doubt it. But I would need to see the actual missile strike the residence for me to believe it on the Russian side.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine, on the other hand, has produced so much video evidence of Russian strikes on Ukrainian civilian structures that I don&#39;t need to see more to deem a strike credible. But such is life when navigating the information space of an authoritarian regime.</p>\n</div>",
