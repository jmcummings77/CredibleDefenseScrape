To save you a click, there aren't enough cloudy days to explain why we aren't seeing Russian artillery today like we were in spring/summer of 2022, particularly given the current offensive. Svatove and Bahkmut in January 2023 for example were as sunny as Severodonetsk in May 2022 (both had \\~9 sunny days), yet we have barely above baseline IR emissions from the former and overwhelming emissions from the latter. This suggests less artillery, more dispersed artillery, or different ammunition (with correspondingly different IR emission spectra), or any combination of the three.  \n\n\nThat said, some conclusions can be drawn based on the physics of IR emissions that are broader than the current conflict:  \n\n\n1. Infrared emits in clear spikes for specific molecules such as CO2. The lower wavelengths which correspond to potassium and copper have some manageable transmittance efficiency through clouds. Meaning on sunny or partly cloudy days we could use satellite data to characterize ammunition used, particularly with the newer Landsat high resolution data. This depends on having more spectrographic information than \"fire here\" though provided from satellites to the public.\n2. Historical analysis suggests even overcast days see some artillery IR emissions in the Donbas in May 2022. This is either because they were firing a tremendous amount, or artillery is emitting a different spectrum than just burning wood which survives attenuation through cloud layers with higher efficiency. I suspect the inclusion of metals in combustion is driving some easier to detect infrared emissions spectra than organic combustibles given its tendency to emit at lower wavelengths/higher energies that are closer to visible light and travel more efficiently through water vapor. This would be VIIRS I1 band, but to my knowledge only I4 and I5 are available to the public. \n3. Above and beyond pixels on a map, the fire radiative power (FRP) calculation from IR, assuming clear skies, maps pretty directly to mass combusted. It is a good measure of regional activity over time. For example in wildfire studies, it has a strong correlation with biomass burned. This mostly comes from I5 and I4, the latter of which maps onto the emissions spectra just before the CO2 peak with a focus on the IR photons most likely to survive attenuation through cloud cover (looks like they add a VIIRS 750m cloud correction factor to it as well). These are more generally known as medium and long wave infrared. \n4. Any UV emitted during conflict should be easy to detect regardless of cloud cover. However I don't think any satellites are monitoring that - if anyone knows of any please let me know.   \n\n\nI've put in a request to NOAA for the VIIRS 750m cloud cover data for Ukraine over the same period. If/when I get a response I can probably build a calibration for estimating missing IR photons. Calculating transmission efficiency in an exact matter is impossible given how complex and dynamic clouds are (an outstanding problem in climate research in general), but we can work in reverse and use the historical data from the Donbas front in May 2022 to derive attenuation factors.  \n\n\nAnyway, you can add FIRMS to the growing pile of data that suggest something is degrading with Russian artillery in quantity and/or quality. My background is more in X-ray physics than infrared, so if I've made any errors here please let me know.",

Training funds were never enough and the focus before WW1 was not fighting those types of wars. As lessons were learned, they updated training and the force got better.

Training was actually lengthened DURING the war versus before because they identified issues and fixed them, namely that the replacements weren't good enough. \n\nLook at pilots in the USAAF and USN. Their system of producing quality pilots drastically improved as the war progressed, because they took the steps to make sure that happened.

What happens when they don't invest in the production sources and the shells won't be ready in time? What happens when they try to replace them but quality control is poor? \n\nSame goes with people. If a nation state wants quality replacements for their military they need to invest just as they need to invest in defense procurement to replace equipment and munitions. If they want to expand, they need to invest in those things even more. If they don't, there are consequences that are guaranteed. \n\nRisk vs reward, what did Ukraine or Russia actually get in return for not making those investments? What was the price for those decisions? Looking back, was the Ukrainian refusal to stand up a large replacement training centers to not only produce competent privates but also competent junior officers, and instead do the absolute bare minimum to send them into combat a good decision?  What did that but them in the long term, especially when they so often seek out high attrition battles, and are so infatuated with Kill Ratio strategy? Even if they can maintain better exchange rates, their quality drops the longer this war lasts and then the rates will drop too.\n\nAt best they can hope Russia makes even stupider conclusions.

If a nation state wants quality replacements for their military they need to invest just as they need to invest in defense procurement to replace equipment and munitions. If they want to expand, they need to invest in those things even more. If they don&#39;t, there are consequences that are guaranteed. </p>\n\n<p>Risk vs reward, what did Ukraine or Russia actually get in return for not making those investments? What was the price for those decisions? Looking back, was the Ukrainian refusal to stand up a large replacement training centers to not only produce competent privates but also competent junior officers, and instead do the absolute bare minimum to send them into combat a good decision?  What did that but them in the long term, especially when they so often seek out high attrition battles, and are so infatuated with Kill Ratio strategy? Even if they can maintain better exchange rates, their quality drops the longer this war lasts and then the rates will drop too.</p>\n\n<p>At best they can hope Russia makes even stupider conclusions. And while it&#39;s awesome when an opponent makes as many strategic errors as Russia, basing a strategy that requires them to only be stupid is in of itself incredibly stupid.</p>\n</div>",

Think about this like a Euro fighter program for subs. \n\nNo one is saying it, but I think this is going to be a class of sub that is cheaper than US models, runs off the Rolls Royce compact reactor, and can be built very quickly. The US fleet would be VERY costly to quickly replace. Now that I think about it, it's more like they need a F16 of subs. Lol. \n\nAnother think that AU has to consider is their ability to field a crew. They have has some retention issues with the Collins Class.

The new class will be a fit-for-purpose multi-role fast attack and be built with a lot of native UK / AU (and I&#39;m looking at you New Zealand and Japan) technology. Think about this like a Euro fighter program for subs. </p>\n\n<p>No one is saying it, but I think this is going to be a class of sub that is cheaper than US models, runs off the Rolls Royce compact reactor, and can be built very quickly. The US fleet would be VERY costly to quickly replace. Now that I think about it, it&#39;s more like they need a F16 of subs. Lol. </p>\n\n<p>Another think that AU has to consider is their ability to field a crew. They have has some retention issues with the Collins Class.

To have ended on July 3 means, and considering the forces on Donets had 20-40 km to retreat to their next fall back line, that would mean the retreat took weeks to execute and would have been authorized sometime in mid June.

That one was a massive retrograde operation, removing ~30k troops and most of their equipment and supplies through tenuous supply lines. Numerous OSINT analysts caught it since late Oct but there was no official word of it even starting until Nov 10, which was actually the day they finished. \n\nTo pull off a successful retreat typically requires surprise, with deception plans often being part of them. So if the Ukrainians were retreating from Bakhmut, made much harder by their present tactical situation especially with tenuous routes out, not only should they do their best to hide it but they should take steps to use deception too.\n\nHowever, I might be wrong and instead Zelensky forced the UAF to double down on Bakhmut because he's worried about optics, which would be the only reason he's stupid enough to not only tell everyone his future strategy but also tell everyone he's allowing them to commit forces from the strategic reserve to pull it off.

In all reality it could be either or both, but there is some legit evidence that part of it is Zelensky..\n\nOne, Maneuver Defense is not only Ukrainian military doctrine (it's their term, the US calls it Mobile Defense) but it's the right choice when fighting a country like Russia with a limited force that needs to be preserved. I've wondered since the war started why they don't use it, instead preferring die hard positional defenses as policy. But the RUSI report from November gave some evidence on that, saying that military commanders wanted to do a maneuver defense of the Donbas last spring but were denied because, according to RUSI, they needed to protect/defend the civilians that didn't evacuate. I don't particularly buy that at all, but either way that's a political decision and even RUSI absolved it saying that it's a good thing that military and elected officials can work together, blah blah.\n\nTwo, Zelensky constantly ingrates himself into tactical battles, like Severodonetsk and now Bakhmut.  He talks then up on ways that become dangerous, he starts talking about tactics to justify his decisions (saying Severodonetsk will be harder to retake than defend, or after Bakhmut there is an open road to Sloviansk-Kramatorsk, both of which are untrue). Plus, Zelensky [flat out accused the Mariupol defenders of ignoring HIS order to retreat](https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/zelensky-i-told-ukrainian-defenders-of-mariupol-they-can-leave-the-city-they-refused). So assuming Zelensky didn't lie when he absolved himself of responsibility for Mariupol and blamed the defenders, that can only mean two things: either Zaluzhnyi himself, the regional commander running OC-E, the commander of the JFO, and whoever was in command at Mariupol all lacked the military acumen to know whether or not they should retreat and only Zelensky had the insight to know it was the right military decision to authorize two understrength brigades to withdraw as they were being cut off. Or nobody in the military chain of command was allowed to make the decision because they had a policy that at a minimum required Zelensky to bless off the retreat.\n\nAnd he shouldn't. That's the tactical and operational level of war and Zelensky is a total amateur with zero military skills or knowledge, he has no business getting involved, and he's undermining the military chain of command who are professionals and much better informed about the local situation than anyone in a climate controlled bunker in Kyiv. UNLESS Zelensky considers any retreat to be of strategic importance and a political decision, which then makes it his business, his decision. Which is also a terrible and horrible policy, but likely the one Ukraine is stuck using, having less to do with Zelensky and his political skills to take control and more to do with how the Ukrainian govt and military relationship functions over time. \n\nTen bucks says this stems from decisions made in 2014-5 to neuter regional military commanders, especially over concerns they weren't loyal. Why did Crimea fall in 2014 without a real fight? It wasn't because Kyiv told them not to fight, it was because the regional military commander [gave that order for troops to stand down because he was pro Russian](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-annexation/why-ukrainian-forces-gave-up-crimea-without-a-fight-and-nato-is-alert-idUSKBN1A90G0).

Reinforcements sent to Bakhmut can't been used elsewhere, not when they get ground up. Artillery ammo (already supposedly in limited supply) that gets used to hold Bakhmut can't be used elsewhere.\n\nUkraine can tie up Russians by attacking even more effectively than defending, that's why last year when they were defending Donbas they launched counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson. It's why when there was a major strategic offensive planned for Kherson in late August, they planned another offensive in Kharkiv to take the pressure off. They're called \"fixing attacks\" for a reason, not fixing defenses.\n\nLosing Bakhmut won't suddenly allow the Russians to attack elsewhere. If they take Bakhmut and decide not to try to take Chasiv Yar or the rest of ridgeline that leads to Sloviansk, which is what Zelensky was complaining about two days ago, and instead do something like send forces to reinforce the assault on Avdiivka, then Ukraine can do that too. It's especially easier to do it if Ukraine retreats because the fall back position on the ridgeline west of Bakhmut is a dominant defensive position, two terrain features to defend from, and straight, a shorter frontage that can be manned by fewer troops than the heavily curved lines currently around Bakhmut that need to be heavily reinforced just to not be overrun. Which means if they retreat they can free up even more forces to shift and reinforce other areas the Russians are attacking.\n\nWagner aren't Russia's best troops, at least not the ones that UAF are mostly killing and wounding (which would be the many tens of thousands of excons they recruited solely to use as cannon fodder). And if the UAF wanted to kill and wound more of them, it's best to do it from a tactical location that is actually tactically beneficial. Not when they're doing their all just to survive and keep minimal supply lines open.\n\nBesides, the Ukrainians just pulled back from the river and abandoned the entire eastern side of Bakhmut. They pulled most of their maneuver brigades out. So we know for a fact they're already retreating, just not the scale or timeline. There have been no substantial counterattacks, and those would be absolutely critical to stabilize the situation to hold indefinitely.",

                "body": "MIG-29 is a light interceptor. The UA already has a ton, it was the backbone of the late Cold War Soviet AF. It\u2019s design was to do short range, high speed interceptions from improvised air fields. It\u2019s got two very big gas guzzling engines on a very small airframe, making it a superb dog fighter. As most Soviet planes are. The cost is that the MIG has a very small range, and IIRC can only carry one drop tank. This obviously is a big limitation. \n\nThe next limitation is it\u2019s radar, it was always intended to be backed up by ground based radar which could guide the MIG onto target. Soviet designers recognized that they were at a qualitative disadvantage to US platforms eg the F-15 and so designed ambush hunters instead. The  MIGs onboard radar is smaller and worse than American variants and is nothing to write home about, putting it at a disadvantage compared to top of the line modern Russian aircraft. \n\nAnd then there is the weapons load out. MIG can mount nearly everything in the Russian arsenal, but not the dreaded R-37 missile which they have no counter to. The Mig can mount the R-77 (good) but even NATo variants can\u2019t mount the AIM-120 (bad). Even worse are missile stocks, likely most of what Eastern Europe has are Soviet vintage first generation R-77 fox3s, and tons of R-27 semi-active and ir homing missiles (very bad). If Ukraine wants something vaguely modern they either need modernized R-77s, and they\u2019re not on good terms with the people who make those, or they need AIM-120Cs from NATO sticks. Or the European equivalent. Issue is avionics, these missiles expect you to have some sophisticated computer systems. MIGs are brutally simple. You can hack something together, but to what end and how worth it is it in regards to gained capabilities? This we don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s an issue. \n\nIn terms of ground attack the MIG sucks. It\u2019s a dog fighter and it was never designed to do heavy ground attack. It\u2019s like putting a trailer hitch on a Porsche. Yeah you could, but it\u2019s about the dumbest thing I could think of. The exception is with the HARM capability added last summer. Which is HUGE and is a big good sign for the MIG and NATO missile integration. The HARM is a very sophisticated system so it suggests that at least some work to integrating NATO systems in old Soviet tech has produced fruit. But of course the HARM capability is limited, and further ground attack integration hasn\u2019t AFAIK happened. Something like a JSOW or a JASSM might be a good shout on a MIG but I don\u2019t think has happened, and again the limitation there is probably the computer brain on the aircraft. \n\nThe MIG is great for what it is and the war it was designed to fight. If the Russians were trying run penetration raids on Ukrainian cities with traditional aviation, the MIG would be a HUGE asset. Quick off the ground, fast, can take off almost anywhere. But in the missile & CAS war both sides are waging, the MIG isn\u2019t well suited. NATO stocks are particularly poorly suited to this because they\u2019ve been cut off from Russian upgrades and modernizations, while modernize Russian Flankers and MIGs are still relatively modern. \n\nBut the MIG has one thing going for it, it\u2019s a damn sexy plane. I love the clean lines of the MIG-29 and SU-27. Good looking airframes.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>MIG-29 is a light interceptor. The UA already has a ton, it was the backbone of the late Cold War Soviet AF. It\u2019s design was to do short range, high speed interceptions from improvised air fields. It\u2019s got two very big gas guzzling engines on a very small airframe, making it a superb dog fighter. As most Soviet planes are. The cost is that the MIG has a very small range, and IIRC can only carry one drop tank. This obviously is a big limitation. </p>\n\n<p>The next limitation is it\u2019s radar, it was always intended to be backed up by ground based radar which could guide the MIG onto target. Soviet designers recognized that they were at a qualitative disadvantage to US platforms eg the F-15 and so designed ambush hunters instead. The  MIGs onboard radar is smaller and worse than American variants and is nothing to write home about, putting it at a disadvantage compared to top of the line modern Russian aircraft. </p>\n\n<p>And then there is the weapons load out. MIG can mount nearly everything in the Russian arsenal, but not the dreaded R-37 missile which they have no counter to. The Mig can mount the R-77 (good) but even NATo variants can\u2019t mount the AIM-120 (bad). Even worse are missile stocks, likely most of what Eastern Europe has are Soviet vintage first generation R-77 fox3s, and tons of R-27 semi-active and ir homing missiles (very bad). If Ukraine wants something vaguely modern they either need modernized R-77s, and they\u2019re not on good terms with the people who make those, or they need AIM-120Cs from NATO sticks. Or the European equivalent. Issue is avionics, these missiles expect you to have some sophisticated computer systems. MIGs are brutally simple. You can hack something together, but to what end and how worth it is it in regards to gained capabilities? This we don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s an issue. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of ground attack the MIG sucks. It\u2019s a dog fighter and it was never designed to do heavy ground attack. It\u2019s like putting a trailer hitch on a Porsche. Yeah you could, but it\u2019s about the dumbest thing I could think of. The exception is with the HARM capability added last summer. Which is HUGE and is a big good sign for the MIG and NATO missile integration. The HARM is a very sophisticated system so it suggests that at least some work to integrating NATO systems in old Soviet tech has produced fruit. But of course the HARM capability is limited, and further ground attack integration hasn\u2019t AFAIK happened. Something like a JSOW or a JASSM might be a good shout on a MIG but I don\u2019t think has happened, and again the limitation there is probably the computer brain on the aircraft. </p>\n\n<p>The MIG is great for what it is and the war it was designed to fight. If the Russians were trying run penetration raids on Ukrainian cities with traditional aviation, the MIG would be a HUGE asset. Quick off the ground, fast, can take off almost anywhere. But in the missile &amp; CAS war both sides are waging, the MIG isn\u2019t well suited. NATO stocks are particularly poorly suited to this because they\u2019ve been cut off from Russian upgrades and modernizations, while modernize Russian Flankers and MIGs are still relatively modern. </p>\n\n<p>But the MIG has one thing going for it, it\u2019s a damn sexy plane.

Of course you could do none too. But of course every test fire done by an operational unit wears out the CU too. So you have to figure that a certain % are going to be used up a year. So if you want 108 deployable missiles, you really figure you need 108+training units+the estimated loss%.

But what began with a bang stalled into something less substantial \u2014 a persistent deluge of digital attacks, yet nothing near the full-blown cyber-hostilities that many predicted. \n\n> Cybersecurity officials familiar with the conflict say a primary reason is that Ukraine was ready for it \u2013 and had considerable help from technology companies based in the US and elsewhere to bolster its cyber defenses.\n\n> State-sponsored Russian hackers have bullied Ukrainian networks for a generation, targeting businesses and electric utilities, even shutting off the power in 2015 and again in 2016, cybersecurity experts said. A 2017 attack on Ukraine\u2019s financial sector by Russia, using NotPetya malware, spiraled across the globe and cost a reported $10 billion in damages.\n\n>Knowing that an attack was possible, Ukrainian officials started preparing for Russian hackers in the fall of 2021. In addition to support from Western governments, technology companies like Microsoft, Google and others have provided support to the Ukrainian government to bolster cyber defenses. In addition to providing free software, the tech companies have shared analysis on Russian hackers, helped the government probe for areas of vulnerabilities in networks and provided intelligence on cyber threats.\n\n>Another contributing factor, experts say, is that Russian President Vladimir Putin expected the war to be wrapped up quickly, blitzing Ukraine with troops \u2013 and cyberattacks \u2013 that would cause that country\u2019s government to quickly collapse. Along with numerous failures by Russia\u2019s military, its plan to use cyber operations as part of a hybrid war have consistently fallen short \u201cwithout substantially enabling troop progress,\u201d according to a Feb. 9 report by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.\n\n>\u201cTo meaningfully influence a war at this scale, cyber operations must be conducted at a tempo that Russia apparently could sustain for only weeks at most,\u201d said Jon Bateman, a senior fellow in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in a December panel discussion.\n\n>In an email, Bateman, who published an analysis in December on Russia\u2019s cyber operations in Ukraine, added, \u201cI don\u2019t see Russia\u2019s cyber failures as primarily a problem of planning. Rather, Moscow\u2019s cyber forces lacked the capacity and staying power necessary for a war of this scale.\u201d\n\n>As for why Russia hasn\u2019t lashed back at the US and other countries supporting Ukraine, at least not in a major way, experts believe that Putin simply didn\u2019t want to pick more fights given the problems he\u2019s faced on the battlefield. \n\n>Erica Lonergan, a research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University, said that while Russia hasn\u2019t exercised restraint on the battlefield in Ukraine, \u201cit does seem to not want a fight with both Ukraine and NATO.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s a good news story,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see this as a successful case for cyber deterrence.\u201d But she warned that the US and its allies should be considering what factors might cause Russia to change its mind.\n\n> While it hasn\u2019t been a full-on cyberwar, the invasion of Ukraine marks the first time that cyber operations have played such a prominent role in a world conflict, according to Google.  The cybersecurity firm Mandiant, now part of Google Cloud, tracked more destructive cyberattacks in Ukraine during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years. \n\n> Destructive cyberattacks against Ukraine peaked in the first quarter of 2022 and surged again at the end of the year, while intelligence operations peaked in the first quarter and then leveled off for the remainder of the year, according to another cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. So-called wiper malware, for instance, was capable of deleting data and rendering affected devices inoperable. \n\n>\u201cI think it was really rough in the beginning of the invasion,\u201d said Sandra Joyce, vice president of Mandiant intelligence. \u201cThe wipers were very aggressive, and it was hand-to-hand combat in the cyber domain in the beginning.

Chasiv Yar is already being pressured, if they take those heights then Sloviansk's days are numbered. Plus, Avdiivka has never been more vulnerable to being outflanked. \n\nBut let's say you're right. After Bakhmut falls the Russians call it quits for the time being. Other than political optics over morale, how is that bad? \n\nReznikov can't stop doom posting about artillery shortages and what they need to conduct proper operations. If the fighting takes a break then they shoot less and can stockpile the ammo they would otherwise shoot, conserving for their big strategic offensive. Likewise, they can actually train their troops instead of sending them into a meat grinder with a few days or maybe weeks of training. You know how they might actually want to build up a strategic reserve of fresh units to go on the offensive with? Pretty hard to do that when they keep getting committed to Bakhmut.\n\n>So the Ukranian general staff has a choice, hold on to Bahkmut, fight in less then ideal positions but still exact a heavy toll from the Russian forces.

Scarce and high value assets like long range S-300 and S-400 are likely positioned well behind the front. I'd say at least some tens of km.\n\nOnly some of the missiles that these systems employ could, in theory, shoot down an aircraft at those distances. And these missiles are likely very costly and in a relatively low number compared to other assets.\n\nFrom various [papers](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2860&context=parameters)/reports I read, the 120-150-200 or even 400km figures that russian show to the public are more notional than anything, and likely lower or much lower in a real combat situation.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that there is a pretty long kill chain to close before shooting down an aircraft at those distances. You need to know there's an aircraft, track it and then engage it.\n\nMany think at this stuff like circles on a map, but in reality there is no static S-300/400 radar always scanning the whole sky 24 hours a day (it would be destroyed after 3 days, or likely earlier).\n\nSo, they first need to know that an aircraft is coming, and that's not easy to begin with, then they need some time to assess what's going on, prepare a fire solution (even if now much of this is automated. Still, friendly fire can certainly happen, and it happened to russians blowing their own SU-34 few days ago) and then try to engage it.\n\nFor the aircraft, there's time to release the bomb and maneuver away. Also, there's still the risk that an aircraft with anti radiation missiles will lock on you after you turn on your radars. And ARMs ukraine received from the US could have range from several tens of km to under 200 km.\n\nI really can't say how they will be effective, but one has to take these things (and likely others) into account.",

I think Russia is likely suffering more from it though at the moment. In late Spring and through the Summer last year, Russia used extraordinary amounts of ammunition (estimates of 30-60k rounds per day). That was wholly unsustainable though, they were firing that many because they didn't have enough manpower to actually take ground otherwise. \n\nAt this point there's been some narrowing of the playing field between the two sides. I wouldn't quite say parity, as Russia still fires considerably more ammunition daily. But Ukraine has much better precision capabilities than Russia, which helps mitigate the fact that they fire fewer rounds. \n\nI think the overall trend has been one in which Ukraine is approaching parity. Russia used to enjoy a HUGE advantage in artillery (as much as 5x more rounds per day) but that's now down to maybe 2x as many rounds a day. Still a big advantage for Russia, but no longer a decisive one.",

Can&#39;t imagine that a handful of all-voluntary reddit mods could be arsed with all that.</p>\n</div>",
