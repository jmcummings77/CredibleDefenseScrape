And do you believe Russia's actions in occupied territories constitute genocide?\n\nI see, the strawman argument didn't work, now try cornering. I didn't say that I sincerely believed that Ukraine was committing genocide, I shared what I read and the conclusion i derieved from it.\n\nSo once again you are getting into the good/evil, right/wrong binary debate. I will indulge you just this once.\n\nRussian invasion is as justified as US invasion of Iraq, it doesn't matter if it's justified, the fact is that Ukraine is getting wrecked. A Canadian PM described living next to America as lying next to an elephant where you have to ensure you don't get crushed. The US canadian relation is what deft diplomacy looks like.\n\nZelensky has proven to be a good wartime leader, he did fail to find a diplomatic solution to prevent a war and Ukraine is paying the price.  Remember that he was elected on a plank f peace with Russia, Ukranians didn't want a war.I would have been more impressed had he prevented the war and managed concessions from both Russia and the West. \n\nThat might not satisfy your binary worldview, but that's my take on it. Now if you want to comeback with ,'how could he do it\"?  \"Russia is unreasonable\" etc. I suggest you study history.\n\nUkriane has been set back by decades due to this war. A significant percentage of population is lost forever and many will live with trauma for rest of their lives. Expect to see high alcoholism rate and drug use post conflict. As an FYI, US has lost more vets to suicide than it did it Iraq and Afghanistan. If that's the condition in the US, I will let you decide how well Ukraine is equipped to deal with it.",

And do you believe Russia&#39;s actions in occupied territories constitute genocide?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I see, the strawman argument didn&#39;t work, now try cornering. I didn&#39;t say that I sincerely believed that Ukraine was committing genocide, I shared what I read and the conclusion i derieved from it.</p>\n\n<p>So once again you are getting into the good/evil, right/wrong binary debate. I will indulge you just this once.</p>\n\n<p>Russian invasion is as justified as US invasion of Iraq, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s justified, the fact is that Ukraine is getting wrecked. A Canadian PM described living next to America as lying next to an elephant where you have to ensure you don&#39;t get crushed. The US canadian relation is what deft diplomacy looks like.</p>\n\n<p>Zelensky has proven to be a good wartime leader, he did fail to find a diplomatic solution to prevent a war and Ukraine is paying the price.  Remember that he was elected on a plank f peace with Russia, Ukranians didn&#39;t want a war.I would have been more impressed had he prevented the war and managed concessions from both Russia and the West. </p>\n\n<p>That might not satisfy your binary worldview, but that&#39;s my take on it. Now if you want to comeback with ,&#39;how could he do it&quot;?  &quot;Russia is unreasonable&quot; etc. I suggest you study history.</p>\n\n<p>Ukriane has been set back by decades due to this war. A significant percentage of population is lost forever and many will live with trauma for rest of their lives. Expect to see high alcoholism rate and drug use post conflict. As an FYI, US has lost more vets to suicide than it did it Iraq and Afghanistan. If that&#39;s the condition in the US, I will let you decide how well Ukraine is equipped to deal with it.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "A quick note on what the AGM-88 HARM does.\n\nAFAIK, it homes in on the radar transmitter for radar based SAM systems. It is capable of doing that because any radio transmission gives a direction toward the transmitter. There is a whole science behind this. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_finding\n\nThe only downside with direction finding is it does not give a distance (that would require amplitude analysis, which is very unreliable due to atmospheric conditions and can be changed by the radar operator). So figuring out the distance requires some triangulation. Usually the radar installation is at a static location, so the missile can use the history of radar signals (along with GPS coordinates of the missile) to determine the location of the static location to a high degree of accuracy. The reliance on sophisticated electronics and GPS is probably a major reason Russia doesn't have a capable SEAD program. My guess, Russia just doesn't have a significant number of radar homing missiles required to knock out Ukraine air defenses. \n\nTo counter the AGM-88, there are multiple techniques. First, don't use radar. It works specifically on homing in on radar signals, so if your SAM system uses visual or IR in order to acquire a target, the AGM-88 will not work. Second, use radar sparingly. If you think an attack is coming, do one or two sweeps to see if there are any enemy targets up there. Third, build a lot of radar transmitters (as they will be destroyed) and space them far away (50-100m+) from other critical SAM infrastructure (missiles, or command vehicle). Vietnam used these techniques quite effectively to shoot down US aircraft in North Vietnam. BUT, the US was still able to operate over North Vietnam the whole war (at the cost of a lot of aircraft/crew). \n\nYou may ask, why do you want to use radar instead of Visual/IR acquisition? Well, there is a good answer. Radar works through clouds (depending on frequency) and at a much further distance than visual/IR solutions. We're talking hundreds or even up to a thousand miles plus (depending on transmitter power and frequency). Visual/IR solutions can only work in the 20-50 mile range (depending on weather obviously - and advanced optical equipment - which Russia might not have). \n\nRussian radar has obviously been effective on the battlefield as Ukrainian jets have been consistently flying on the deck to avoid it. As radar works line of sight, aircraft can use the curvature of the earth to hide. \n\nGiven the above, having the AGM-88 on the battlefield changes the game. Without the AGM-88, Russia can basically blanket the front with radar and shoot long range missiles at anything that is 0-200 miles behind Ukraine lines and not on the deck. Now Ukraine can't operate any aircraft at high altitude. \n\nAs I understand, this has significantly impacted the effectiveness of the TB2 drone. The TB2 operates at high altitude to remain far away from manpads and IR/Visual based target acquisition. But it is still vulnerable to radar quite a behind the front. \n\nAnother aspect of this is if Ukraine gets the F16, it can deploy the GBU-39. The GBU-39 is a 250lb bomb can glide ~50 miles from an F16 at high altitude and is precision guided. An F16 can carry about 6-8 of them, enough to heavily damage a grid square. If Russia is denied the capability of using radar, it would have a very difficult time acquiring the F16, and now Ukraine can operate the F16 fairly safely ~50 miles behind the line and drop precision munitions. This is specifically helpful in Kherson/Crimea which is way outside of the range of S300/400s on Russian soil. \n\nGiven the above, Ukraine may be very close to operating close air support missions with the TB2 and F16. And that is a major major game changer. Russia has no counter to that outside of radar based SAM systems.",

It is based on a single figure (the number of Ukrainian officers between the ranks of junior lieutenant and colonel lost) and then proceeds to deduce the number of total losses using comparable statistics for similar wars.\n\nTheir main conclusion is that Ukraine has not suffered crippling losses and can sustain at least 1.5-2 years of war of similar intensity. They also note that the number of Ukrainian prisoners compared to casualties is extremely low, indicating a high level of motivation of the Ukrainian forces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Previously, I have avoided the topic of military casualties in texts on the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, both for moral and ethical reasons and because of the lack of data from which to draw any conclusions.Recently, however, I came across a very interesting figure obtained by the Russian OSINT team LostArmour, which collected and summarized data on dead officers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In total, we are talking about 960 commanders in the rank from colonel to junior lieutenant (I note that the LA in this case acts as a biased source, ideologically interested in the most accurate figures of losses of the AFU - in this situation, this fact plays a positive role).Why is this important? Based on the exact figures of loss in the ranks of the officer corps, it is possible to understand what losses the Ukrainian army suffered over the past 5 months of combat operations.To begin with, an important clarification must be made - the current conflict is characterized by the mass use of artillery, and it is the actions of artillery that are the main cause of losses among the personnel of both sides. For correct calculations, it would be best to resort to studies of World War II casualty statistics that were closest in nature to the current fighting.In our case these would be:\u2796 The Journal of Slavic Military Studies (1996) study The Price of War: Human Casualties of the USSR and Germany, 1939-1945;\u2796 Study \"THE RELATIONSHIP OF BATTLE DAMAGE TO UNIT COMBAT PERFORMANCE\" by Leonard Weinstein of the Institute for Defense Analysis (1986);\u2796 The article \"Fight Outnumbered and Win... Against What Odds\" by U.S. Army Colonel D. Gans, published in Military Review (1981).How do we count?\u2796 The average officer-to-soldier ratio for the armed forces is 1:24.7\u2796 The classic ratio of wounded to killed in wars with extensive use of artillery systems is 1:3\u2796 A unit loses combat effectiveness when it reaches a 35% casualty rate\u2796 On average (taking into account the development of modern military medicine) 9% of wounded become disabled, unable to return to active dutyWhat losses has the Ukrainian army suffered?\u2796 From 23 to 24 thousand deadFrom 70 to 72 thousand wounded\u2796 6.5 to 7 thousand wounded who will not return to action\u2796 Total number of casualties (killed, disabled, prisoners of war) is 37,000 servicemen\u2796 The total number of losses, (hospitalized and non-returnable) is 108,000 soldiersThe above figures are fairly accurate, given the accuracy of the data on dead officers - the margin of error is in the region of 5000 people (in the column \"total\"). At first glance, this number of dead and wounded seems staggering - and it certainly is from the point of view of universal morality.But from the point of view of military science these figures look quite different.During 5 months of large-scale combat operations (under conditions of total fire superiority of Russian troops) AFU suffered irretrievable losses in 14.5% of the total number of pre-war personnel army (255 000 thousand) or 5.3% of the wartime army (700 000 thousand).This suggests that structurally the Ukrainian army has not suffered losses that could undermine its ability to fight (at least 35-40% of personnel must be lost to do so).Moreover, the AFU has crossed the \"psychological bar\" of 100 thousand wounded and killed - in a number of studies we can find statements that upon reaching such a \"bar\" the army, having any defects of organizational structure, lose the ability to perform combat tasks, which we do not observe in the example of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Therefore, statements by individuals (or the media) about the imminent disintegration of the Ukrainian army due to \"heavy losses\" should be considered, at a minimum, irresponsible or incompetent - or, at a maximum, misinformed.P.S.: the number of prisoners of war in the calculations is based on Russian data, according to which 6 to 8 thousand Ukrainian soldiers are in captivity.  \n>  \n>\u2796 The extremely low number of prisoners of war draws attention. The usual ratio of killed to prisoners of war under such conditions is 1:3. What is the reason for this? Probably a combination of factors - rather high motivation of personnel and a certain indicator of the quality of their training. The nature of combat operations certainly also plays its part;\u2796 The 35-40% loss threshold also does not mean that once it is reached the process of army disintegration begins - it indicates a significant decrease in its effectiveness and ability to conduct combat operations;\u2796 The overall level of losses does not reflect their impact on the combat effectiveness of mechanized units - they require calculations of a different nature, taking into account both armor and personnel losses;\u2796 The thesis that once a unit reaches a certain loss threshold, it loses the will and motivation to continue fighting is false. Where troop morale is high, even very high losses will not take the unit out of combat;\u2796 The average monthly losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including combat casualties, are between 21,000 and 22,000 soldiers;\u2796 The Ukrainian Army is capable of conducting combat operations while maintaining its current effectiveness for at least 7-8 months, depending on the nature of their intensity, without the infusion of additional batches of mobilized soldiers. Given the emerging positional confrontation, this period may extend to 1 year; with the infusion of fresh reinforcements - from 1.5 to 2 years (these figures do not take into account changes in the military and technical equipment of the troops in the downward/upward direction);\u2796 Apparently, the fact that mobilized soldiers are manning \"Soviet-type\" battalions, i.e. with a large number of personnel directly involved in combat operations, also adds to the stability of the Ukrainian army. Such units can fight with a loss of even 70% of their personnel.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Edit: forgot the link</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/atomiccherry/471\">https://t.me/atomiccherry/471</a></p>\n\n<p>An interesting (if a bit long) Russian-source speculation on the number of Ukrainian casualties. It is based on a single figure (the number of Ukrainian officers between the ranks of junior lieutenant and colonel lost) and then proceeds to deduce the number of total losses using comparable statistics for similar wars.</p>\n\n<p>Their main conclusion is that Ukraine has not suffered crippling losses and can sustain at least 1.5-2 years of war of similar intensity. They also note that the number of Ukrainian prisoners compared to casualties is extremely low, indicating a high level of motivation of the Ukrainian forces.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Previously, I have avoided the topic of military casualties in texts on the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, both for moral and ethical reasons and because of the lack of data from which to draw any conclusions.Recently, however, I came across a very interesting figure obtained by the Russian OSINT team LostArmour, which collected and summarized data on dead officers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In total, we are talking about 960 commanders in the rank from colonel to junior lieutenant (I note that the LA in this case acts as a biased source, ideologically interested in the most accurate figures of losses of the AFU - in this situation, this fact plays a positive role).Why is this important? Based on the exact figures of loss in the ranks of the officer corps, it is possible to understand what losses the Ukrainian army suffered over the past 5 months of combat operations.To begin with, an important clarification must be made - the current conflict is characterized by the mass use of artillery, and it is the actions of artillery that are the main cause of losses among the personnel of both sides. For correct calculations, it would be best to resort to studies of World War II casualty statistics that were closest in nature to the current fighting.In our case these would be:\u2796 The Journal of Slavic Military Studies (1996) study The Price of War: Human Casualties of the USSR and Germany, 1939-1945;\u2796 Study &quot;THE RELATIONSHIP OF BATTLE DAMAGE TO UNIT COMBAT PERFORMANCE&quot; by Leonard Weinstein of the Institute for Defense Analysis (1986);\u2796 The article &quot;Fight Outnumbered and Win...

Looking at the [photo circulating](https://nitter.net/pic/orig/media%2FFZkI8uKWQAA4tuZ.jpg), the part number/serial number/cage code all look pretty standard and listed on [WBParts](https://www.wbparts.com/rfq/1420-01-166-7328.html) as someone else pointed out. However, is this a normal mode for this information to be printed on a Raytheon part? I am more familiar with something like an continuous inket printer ([for example](https://jetec.com/site/wp-content/gallery/marking-portfolio/thumbs/thumbs_PO2015-B.JPG)) being used since it can  easily change for different serial #s and such. This is definitely not an inkjet as you don't see the [little dots](https://www.squidink.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/dot-matrix-inkjet-printing.jpg). So for something this clean, it would either be something thats maybe stamped or perhaps transfer (E: Screen) printed - however I don't see why something requiring tooling would be utilized here (unless someone trying to fake it and not spend $30k on the continuous inkjet printer for high production). I'm not good at detecting photoshops, but is that a possibility as well? Not sure why either side would \"fake\" this though.",
